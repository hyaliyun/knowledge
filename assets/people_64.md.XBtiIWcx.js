An author of a tafsir is a ''''' (; plural: ). A Quranic tafsir attempts to provide elucidation, explanation, interpretation, context or commentary for clear understanding and conviction of God's will. Principally, a tafsir deals with the issues of linguistics, jurisprudence, and theology. In terms of perspective and approach, tafsir can be broadly divided into two categories, namely tafsir bi- al-ma'thur (lit. received tafsir), which is transmitted from the early days of Islam through the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions, and tafsir bi- al-ra'y (lit. tafsir by opinion), which is arrived through personal reflection or independent rational thinking. There are different characteristics and traditions for each of the tafsirs representing respective schools and doctrines, such as Sunni Islam, Shia Islam, and Sufism. There are also general distinctions between classic tafsirs compiled by authoritative figures of Muslim scholarship during the formative ages of Islam, and modern tafsir which seeks to address a wider audience, including the common people.Mir, Mustansir. (1995). \\"Tafsƒ´r\\". In John L. Esposito. The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World. Oxford: Oxford University Press.  Etymology  The word ' is derived from the three-letter Arabic verbal root of F-S-R (', 'interpret'). In its literal meaning, the word refers to interpreting, explaining, expounding, or disclosing. In Islamic contexts, it is defined as understanding and uncovering God's will which has been conveyed by the Quranic text, by means of the Arabic language and one's own knowledge.Al-Zehebi, Al-Tafsir vel Mufassirun  History  The first examples of tafsir can be traced back to Muhammad. According to Islamic belief, as the Quran was revealed to him, he recited the verses to his companions, usually explaining their meanings to teach them, as it was one of Muhammad's responsibilities.≈ûatibi, El-muvafakat Elements of Muhammad's explanations including clarifying verses whose intents are not understood, the indication of names, places, times etc. which have not been mentioned in the verse, restriction of meanings which have been given as absolute and reconciliation of expressions which seem contradictory. Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Quran, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives (hadith), thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Quran. After the death of Muhammad, his companions (sahabah) undertook the task of interpretation, thus starting a new age in tafsir. Most of the sahabah, including Abu Bakr, refrained from commenting based on their personal views, and only narrated comments by Muhammad. Others including ibn Abbas used their own knowledge from the Arabic language to interpret the Quran. At this stage, tafsir was selective and concise regarding its coverage, and only certain words, phrases and verses were explained. The Quran was still not fully interpreted, and commentaries were not separated from the hadith collection nor written separately, mainly due to other occupations such as the collection of the Quran. By the time of the next generations ensuing the sahabah, scholars in the age of the successors (tabi'in) started using a wide range of sources for tafsir. The whole of the Quran is interpreted, and narrations are separated from tafsir into separate books and literature. Grammatical explanations and historical data are preserved within these books; personal opinions are recorded, whether accepted or rejected. During this time, a whole range of schools of tafsir came into existence in different scholastic centers, including Mecca, Medina and Iraq. Iraqi schools of tafsir came to be known for an approach relied on personal judgment aside from the transmitted reports, and Jewish apocryphal reports were also widely employed. Notable compilers on this age including Sufyan al-Thawri. Until this age, tafsir had been transmitted orally and had not been collected independently in a book, rather, they had been gathered by muhaddithun (lit. scholars of hadith) in their hadith books, under the topic of tafsir, along with other narrations of Muhammad.Muhsin Demirci, Tefsir Usul√º, 120 This indicates that tafsir, in its formative age, used to be a special domain within hadith. Widening of the scope of tafsir and emergence of mufassirun in the age of the successors lead to the development of an independent discipline of tafsir.  Conditions  An author of tafsir is a ' (; plural: ). According to Sunni Islamic scholar Al-Suyuti, mufassirs are required to master 15 fields from different disciplines such as linguistics, rhetoric, theology and jurisprudence before one can authoritatively interpret the Quran. The foremost discipline that constitutes the basis of tafsir learning is Arabic language. Arabic in this context specifically means Classical Arabic. One of the earliest Islamic scholars Mujahid ibn Jabr said, ‚ÄúIt is not permissible for one who holds faith in Allah and the Day of Judgment to speak on the Qur'an without learning classical Arabic.‚Äù Especially relevant expertise is how one learns the meaning of each word. In this respect, it should be known that classical Arabic must be mastered in its entirety because one word may have various meanings; a person may only know two or three of them whereas the meaning of that word in the Qur'an may be altogether different. Other fields related to Arabic language includes Philology of Arabic. It is important because any change in the diacritical marks affects the meaning, and understanding the diacritical marks depends on the science of Arabic philology. Morphology of Arabic language is also important because changes in the configuration of verb and noun forms change the meaning. Ibn Faris said, ‚ÄúA person who misses out on Arabic morphology has missed out on a lot.‚Äù Lastly, Al-Ishtiqaaq is the science of etymology which explains the reciprocal relation and radical composition between the root and derived word. It should be learned because sometimes one word derives from two root words, the meaning of each root word being different. For example, a word masih derives from the root word masah which means ‚Äúto feel something and to touch something with a wet hand,‚Äù but also derives from the root word masaahat which means ‚Äúto measure.‚Äù Another relevant discipline is the science of interpreting the Arabic sentence. Ilm al-Ma‚Äôani is the science by which one figures the syntax through the meaning of a sentence. Ilm al-Bayaan is the science by which one learns the similes, metaphors, metonymies, zuhoor (evident meanings) and khafa (hidden meanings) of the Arabic language. Ilm al-Badi‚Äô is the science by which one learns to interpret sentences in which the beauty and eloquence of the spoken and written word are considered hidden. The above-mentioned three sciences are categorized as Ilm-ul-Balagha (science of rhetoric). It is one of the most principal sciences to a mufassir as it is deemed by Muslims that there are literal and non-literal meanings of the Quran, and one is able to reveal the miraculous nature of the Quran through these three sciences. A field from Quranic teaching is called Ilm al-Qira'at. This is a system of dialecticism of the different readings of the Quran. This science is important because one qira'at (way of reading) of the Quran may differ in meaning from another, and one learns to favor one reading over another based on the difference in the meanings. General sciences of Islamic theology and Islamic study are also imperative. Ilm al-Aqa'id and Ilm al-Kalam are comprehensive sciences in Islamic theology and philosophy. They are important because upon these understandings, one may understand issues such as invalidity of attributing the literal meaning of some ayah to God. In this case, one will be required to interpret the ayah as in ‚Äòthe hand of Allah is over their hand‚Äô. Other key issues required to be addressed through comprehension of theology and philosophy includes that of free will and determinism, or the infallibility of the prophets. Comprehension of Fiqh, Islamic jurisprudence, is important because one cannot gain an overview of any issue until he has understood its particulars. Usul al-Fiqh, principles of Islamic jurisprudence, is also required so one understands the methodology of legal derivation and interpretation. Other distinctive systems linked with tafsir study including Asbaab al-Nuzul, which is the field by which one learns the circumstances in which an ayah is revealed. It is important because the meaning of the ayah is more clearly understood once the circumstances in which it was revealed are known. Sometimes, the meaning of an ayah is wholly dependent on its historical background. Another is Ilm-ul-Naskh, which is knowledge of the abrogated ayah. In general, due to the Quran made up of revelations that revealed to Muhammad in the course of more than twenty years, certain verses are considered meant to be temporary and subsequently repealed by the following ones. Ilm-ul-Nashkh is a science of identifying the abrogations, and it is important because abrogated rulings must be separated from the applied rulings. Ilm al-Hadith is knowledge of the hadith which explain mujmal (general) ayah, and Ilm al- Ladunni is the endowed knowledge which is considered granted by God to his closest servants. This is for example a knowledge obtained directly from Allah through inspiration. They are the servants indicated in the hadith: \\"Allah will grant one who acts upon whatever he knows from a knowledge he never knew.\\" Principles There are several frames of reference in which tafsir can be categorized. The main issue of framing constitutes its methodology. Tafsir can be broadly divided into two categories from the viewpoint of methodology employed in order to approach the interpretation. These categories are called tafsir bi-al-ma'thur (, also known as tafsir bi-al-riwaya ) and tafsir bi-al-ra'y (, also known as tafsir bi-al-diraya ). Tafsir bi-al- ma'thur (tafsir bi-al-riwaya) Tafsir bi-al-ma'thur, or commonly known as tafsir bi-al-riwaya, is the method of commenting on the Quran using traditional sources. Tafsir bi-al-riwaya connotes tafsir using another portion of the Quran, or sayings of Muhammad, or saying of his companions. This classical tafsir method is agreed upon by all scholars, and is the most used method throughout history, partly because other methods have been criticized. Criticism of non-riwaya method is mostly based on two grounds; for one, Muhammad has condemned those who interpret the Quran from their own point of view,Tirmizi, Tafsir, 1 and for two, most companions of Muhammad have refrained from presenting their own ideas.Taberi, Camiul Beyan, I, 27 Some important examples of tafsir bi-al-riwaya are JƒÅmi ø al-BayƒÅn by al-Tabari and Tafseer al-Qur æƒÅn al- øA·∫ìeem by ibn Kathir. The sources used for tafsir bi-al- riwaya can be ordered by the rank of authority, as the Quran, Hadith, the report by Sahaba and Tabi'iun, classical Arabic literature, and Isra'iliyat. The most authoritative source of the interpretation is the Quran itself. Interpretation of the Quran employing other Quranic reference is very common because of the close interrelatedness of the verses of the Quran with one another. The Quranic verses explain and interpret one another, which leads many to believe that it has the highest level of authenticity. Many verses or words in the Quran are explained or further clarified in other verses of the Quran. One example of the hadith which extensively employs this source of method is Al-Mizan fi Tafsir al-Qur'an by Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i. The authoritative source of method second to the Quran is Hadith, by using narratives of Muhammad to interpret the Quran. In this approach the most important external aids used are the collected oral traditions upon which Muslim scholars based Islamic history and law. Authority of this method is considered established by the statement made in the Quran that Muhammad is responsible for explanation and guidance. While some narratives are of revelation origin, others can be the result of reasonings made by Muhammad. One important aspect of these narratives is their origin. Narratives used for tafsir, and in general, must be of authentic origin (sahih). Narratives of such origin are considered requisite for tafsir. Other source of the interpretation includes the accounts of ·π¢a·∏•ƒÅbah, companions of Muhammad, or tabi‚Äòun, the generation after sahabah, and Tabi‚Äò al-Tabi‚Äòin, the generation after tabi'un. Their authority is based on an account in hadith Sahih Bukhari, which accordingly, Muhammad said; > \\"The best people are those living in my generation, then those coming after > them (TƒÅbi‚Äòun), and then those coming after (the second generation)\\". If nothing is found in the Quran or the Hadƒ´th, the commentator has recourse to what the ·π¢a·∏•ƒÅbah reported about various verses. These are generally considered above personal opinion, because these people grew up with everyday interaction with Muhammad, and had often asked about the meanings of verses or circumstances of their revelation; and they were very knowledgeable in both Arabic literature and Islamic thought. Another non-scripture based source of the interpretation is classical Arabic literature. Classical Arabic poetry and the text of the Quran are two resources which can be used as foundational reference in ascertaining the meaning and signification of the remaining literal and figurative diction of the Quran and its style of expression. Using Arabic poetry for defining words is a long used practice, in fact there are very few scholars who haven't used this source.Muhsin Demirci, Tefsir Tarihi, 128 Less authoritative source of the interpretation is Isra'iliyat, which is the body of narratives originating from Judeo-Christian traditions, rather than from other well-accepted sources. The Isra'iliyat are mostly non-biblical explanatory stories and traditions (Hebrew: midrashim) giving extra information or interpretation about events or individuals recorded in the Hebrew scriptures. Scholars starting with the Sahabah have studied narrative accounts of other Abrahamic religions to further explain and clarify verses, especially parables, in the Quran. While some may be accurate, these narratives are not subject to hadith authenticity criteria, and are generally not favored for use. Tafsir bi-al-ra'y (tafsir bi-al-diraya) Tafsir bi- al-ra'y, or commonly known as tafsir bi-al-diraya, is the method of using one's independent rational reasoning and mind (ijtihad) to form an opinion- oriented interpretation. The most distinctive feature of tafsir bi-al-diraya is the inclusion of the opinions of the commentator, thus forming the more objective view on Quranic verses. The relative paucity of traditional sources is also a practical reason why the scope of the methodology is augmented. This is considered sanctioned by the Quran itself, as written in the surah Sad verse 29: This method is not interpretation by mere opinion however, but rather opinions must be based on the main sources. Performing Quranic interpretation using solely one's own opinion is believed to be prohibited by some Muslims. This is based on an authenticated hadith of Muhammad which states \\"He who says (something) concerning the Qur'√¢n without knowledge, he has taken his seat of fire\\".Tirmizi, Tafsir 1 However, this hadith can alternatively be interpreted to refer to the importance of first properly studying and learning the Quran before attempting to teach or preach it to others. Accordingly, the method of independent reasoning (ijtihad) has several qualifications and conditions that need to be satisfied. Due to the nature of orientation toward opinions, this method is rejected by certain scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah, and prohibited by Wahhabi Islamic doctrine. Some important examples of such tafsirs include Anwar al-Tanzil by al-Baydawi and Mafatih al- Ghayb by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Some parameters used by these scholars including linguistic resources, historical sources, methodological concepts such as maqasid or socio-cultural environment taken into consideration. In terms of linguistic resources, literary elements of the Arabic language, including morphology, eloquence, syntax are an integral part of tafsir, as they constitute the basis of understanding and interpretation. Arabic has a systematic way of shaping words so one can know the meaning by knowing the root and the form the word was coined from. If any word can be given a meaning that is compatible with the rules of grammar, Quranic text can be interpreted that way. In terms of historical resources, scholars may choose to interpret verses according to external factors, including their historical context and their place of revelation. Historical context (Asbab al-nuzul) is particularly important to interpret verses according to how the Quran was revealed, when and under which circumstances, and much commentary was dedicated to history. The early tafsirs are considered to be some of the best sources for Islamic history. Classification of the place of revelation, whether it was revealed in Mecca or Medina, is important as well. This is because in general Meccan verses tend to have an iman (loosely translated as faith) nature that includes believing in Allah, Muhammad, and the day of judgment, whether it be theological foundations or basic faith principles. On the other hand, Medinan verses constitute legislation, social obligations, and constitution of a state. On the more conceptual level, the idea of maqasid (goals or purpose) can be taken into account. Verses may be interpreted to preserve the general goals of shariah, which may be considered simply as bringing happiness to a person in this life and the hereafter. That way, any interpretation that threatens to compromise the preservation of religion, life, lineage, intellect or property may be discarded or ruled otherwise in order to secure these goals. Further, the socio-cultural environment may also taken into consideration. This includes understanding and interpreting the Quran while taking into account the cultural and social environment to which it has been revealed; or according to the scholars' own time. Often than not, the distinction can be made between the amm (general) verses that aimed at universal conditions for Muslims, and khass (specific) verses that applied to specific conditions, time or need. This is considered an integral part of analyzing the universality of the Quran. Scholars usually do not favor to confine verses to a single time interval, but rather interpret according to the needs of their time.  Schools  Islamic theology is divided into myriad of schools and branches, and each of the schools' comments on the Quran with their own point of view.  Sunni  Mir Sayyid Ali, writing a Tafsir on the Quran, during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Regarding sunni tafsir, it seems that Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari and Ibn Taimiyya serve as transition points.Farhad Daftary The Study of Shi‚Äòi Islam: History, Theology and Law Bloomsbury Publishing, 08.01.2014 pp. 104-105 The time of Tabari marks the classical period, which encompassed important Sunni tafsirs, such as Tafsir al-Thalabi, Tafsir of Al-Zamakhshari and Tafsir al-Tabari. Tafsir al- Tabari is one of the most important tafsir works in Sunni Islam.C.E. Bosworth. Encyclopedia of Islam 2nd ed Brill. \\"Al-Tabari, Abu Djafar Muhammad b. Djarir b. Yazid\\", Vol. 10, p. 14. This work provides exegetical material for the whole Quran, also contains conflicting information, which Tabari tries either to harmonize or argues in support of the one he feels more correct. Further he includes different readings, which according to him, both might be correct and gives his own opinion after each argumentation. Both linguistical and theological subjects are discussed throughout his work.Herbert Berg The Development of Exegesis in Early Islam: The Authenticity of Muslim Literature from the Formative Period Routledge 03.04.2013 pp. 120-128 The post-classical period is marked by the exegetic methodology of Ibn Kathir. Although ibn Kathir claimed to rely on the works of Tabari, he introduced new methods for his exegesis, based on the teachings of Ibn Taimiyya.Karen Bauer Gender Hierarchy in the Qur'an: Medieval Interpretations, Modern Responses Cambridge University Press 2015 page 115 His monovalency and rejection of Isra'iliyyat are significant for his tafsir.Johanna Pink Sunnitischer Tafs?r in der modernen islamischen Welt: Akademische Traditionen, Popularisierung und nationalstaatliche Interessen Brill, 11.11.2010 p. 40 (German) It is much more selective, than previous tafsir.Oliver Leaman The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia Taylor & Francis 2006 page 632 Intellectual disciplines of grammar, law and theology brought into debate did no longer played a role in Quranic exegesis.Teresa Bernheimer, Andrew Rippin Muslims: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices Routledge, 01.03.2013 chapter 11 In contemporary scholarship translations of previous tafsirs into English language are usually abridged versions of their longer original. One widespread version of Tafsir Ibn Kathir is published under the editorship of Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman. Such translations are often omitting content, to guide the readers against \\"wrong\\" content, following the puritanian approaches. Ibn Kathir gained widespread popularity, probably due to his straight approach in his own work, and the lack of alternative translations of traditional tafsirs.Andreas G√∂rke and Johanna Pink Tafsir and Islamic Intellectual History Exploring the Boundaries of a Genre Oxford University Press in association with The Institute of Ismaili Studies London p. 478 Abridged translations into Western language also appeared for Tafsir Tabari. One French version provided by Pierre God√© appeared in 1983.Andreas G√∂rke and Johanna Pink Tafsir and Islamic Intellectual History Exploring the Boundaries of a Genre Oxford University Press in association with The Institute of Ismaili Studies London p.479 He edited the work in a way, that the author appears 'orthodox'. An English translation of Tabari by J. Cooper appeared in 1986.History of al-Tabari Vol. 1, The: General Introduction and From the Creation to the Flood, Band 1 SUNY Press, 10.06.2015 p. 111  Shia  Tafsir by Shia Islam similarly deals with the issues concerned by Sunnis, and employs similar methodology as well, except for the adherence toward certain beliefs and creeds Shiism espouses. Distinctive features of Shia tafsirs include expounding of the concept of imamate, the heavier weight put on verses that considered to be the foundation of successorship to Muhammad within the Prophet's family begins with Ali, and the heavier authority put on interpretations attributed to The Twelve Imams. These characteristics result in distinction being made between the esoteric and the exoteric meaning of the Quran, and the esoteric meaning attributed to the imams preferred over the exoteric meaning. Certain Shia tafsirs are influenced by Mu'tazili thoughts as well, specifically on the theological issues. On the other hand, tafsir by Zaidi school of jurisprudence, which espouses the doctrine closest with Sunnis of all Shia sects, produces tafsir resembling Sunni tafsir in its quality. Some Zaidi tafsirs are considered popular among Sunnis as well. Some of the important examples of Shia mufassirs and its tafsir are Al-Tibbyan Fi Tafsir al-Quran by Shaykh Tusi (460/1067), and Majma al-Bayan lif'ulum al-Quran by Shaykh Tabarsi (d. 548/1153).  Other  Mu‚Äôtazilah = The Mu'tazila tradition of tafsir has received little attention in modern scholarship, owing to several reasons. First, several exegetical works by Mu'tazila scholars have been studied as books on theology rather than as works of tafsir. Secondly, the large Mu'tazilite tafsir at-Tahdib fi tafsir al-Qur'an by al-Hakim al-Jishumi has not been edited, and there is no complete copy of it available at any single location, which limits its accessibility to scholars. = Ahmadiyya = The Ahmadiyya movement has published a number of Quran commentaries, these include Tafseer- e-Kabeer by Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad (Urdu-10 Volumes) and Haqaiq al-furqan by Hakeem Noor-ud-Din (Urdu-4 volumes). Ahmadi interpretation of the Quran reflects their distinctive worldviews on Islamic philosophy and theology, such as rejection of abrogation of the verses and particular emphasis on harmony between the Quran as the word of God and science as the work of God.Friedmann, JihƒÅd in Ahmadƒ´ Thought, , p. 227 = Sufistic approach = It is an interpretation of the Quran which includes attribution of esoteric or mystic meanings to the text by the interpreter. In this respect, its method is different from the conventional exegesis. Esoteric interpretations do not usually contradict the conventional (in this context called exoteric) interpretations; instead, they discuss the inner levels of meaning of the Quran. A hadith from Muhammad which states that the Quran has an inner meaning, and that this inner meaning conceals a yet deeper inner meaning, and so on (up to seven levels of meaning), has sometimes been used in support of this view. Islamic opinion imposes strict limitations on esoteric interpretations especially when interior meaning is against exterior one. Esoteric interpretations are found mainly in Sufism and in the sayings (hadiths) of Shi'a Imams and the teachings of the Isma'ili sect. But Muhammad and the imams gave importance to its exterior as much as to its interior; they were as much concerned with its revelation as they were with its interpretation. These are generally not independently written, however, they are found in the books of Sufis. Some examples are Hakaik al-tafsir by Sulemi, and Tafseer-e-Rafai by Faqeer Syed Muhammad Rafai Arab. = Scientific approach = Scholars deeply influenced by the natural and social sciences followed the materialists of Europe or the pragmatists. Under the influence of those secular theories, they declared that the religion's realities cannot go against scientific knowledge.Scientific Exegesis in Malay Qur‚Äôanic Commentary, Nor Syamimi Mohd, Haziyah Hussin & Wan Nasyrudin Wan Abdullah, Faculty of Islamic Studies, The National University of Malaysia, Malaysia What the religion claims to exist, but which the sciences reject should be interpreted in a way that conforms with the science; as for those things which the science is silent about, like the resurrection etc., they should be brought within the purview of the laws of matter; the pillars upon which the divine religious laws are based ‚Äî like revelation, angel, Satan, prophethood, apostleship, Imamah (Imamate) etc. - are spiritual things, and the spirit is a development of the matter. As for the Quran itself, one should not explain it in the light of the old philosophy and theories, because they were not based on observations and tests ‚Äî they were just a sort of mental exercise which has been totally discredited now by the modern science. Found by Ghazali and built upon by Razi, it is one of today's most abundant way of tafsir. A common example is Mafatih al-Ghayb by Fakhruddin al-Razi. = Fiqhi approach = Fiqhi tafsir deals mainly with verses that have a legislative meaning (see ahkam), and it strives to obtain Islamic law from the Quran. It is a very common school classically and modernly. There is a dispute over the number of verses that contain jurisprudence, numbers ranging from 5 to 200 are reported. Works of Fiqhi tafsir were typically written from the perspectives of the madhhab of their respective authors. For example, A·∏•kam al-Qur'an by al-Jassas was written according to the Hanafi Madhhab, A·∏•kam al-Qur'an by Qa·∏çi Ab≈´ Bakr ibn al-'Arabƒ´ and al-Jaami' Li'A·∏•kam al-Qur'an by al-Qurtubi were written according to the Maliki Madhhab, and A·∏•kam al-Qur'an by Ilkiya was written according to the Shafi'i Madhhab. Some also cite Zad al-Maseer of ibn al-Jawzi as an example of a fiqhi tafsir according to the Hanbali Madhhab. =Quranistic approach= Turkish Islamic theologian Ya≈üar Nuri √ñzt√ºrk denounced contemporary Islamic practices as altered. He distinguished between that is called Islam, consisting mainly of customs and traditions introduced in the Umayyad period. In 1992 he published a tafsir-like exegetical work of 760 pages, called Kur'an'daki Islam. He deals with each Sura in one chapter structured around certain verses of the specific sura or words occurring in the text, which need to be explained.Andreas G√∂rke and Johanna Pink Tafsir and Islamic Intellectual History Exploring the Boundaries of a Genre Oxford University Press in association with The Institute of Ismaili Studies London p.446-449 = Unspecified = A newer work which incorporates and quotes the work of a multitude of previous scholars and analyzes the relevant Arabic root words (based on all available classic Arabic meanings), and references all relevant passages of the Quran, was done by Abdul Mannan Omar.

Founded in 1797 as The Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC; French: Barreau du Haut-Canada), the society adopted its current name after a majority vote by its governing body in November 2017. The change was formalized on May 8, 2018, by amendment to provincial legislation. History Receipt dated February 5, 1836 for application to the Law Society of Upper Canada issued to John A. Macdonald, the future first Prime Minister of Canada The Law Society was created in 1797 to regulate the legal profession in the British colony of Upper Canada and is the oldest self-governing body in North America. Its first home was at Wilson's Hotel at Gate and Queen Streets in Newark (now Valumart store in Niagara-on-the-Lake), then from 1799 to 1832 at various temporary locations at York (Toronto) until Osgoode Hall was built in 1832. The Law Society continued to retain its original name, even though Upper Canada ceased to exist as a political entity in 1841. The Society governed the legal profession in the coterminous Canada West from 1841 to 1867, and in Ontario since confederation in 1867. The Law Society of Upper Canada's creation by an act of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada came some 20 years before the earliest such self-governing association in any other Canadian province or territory. Its creation was an innovation in the English- speaking world, and it became the model for law societies across Canada and the United States. It is one of the oldest law societies in the English- speaking world. In 1994, the Law Society affirmed its role by adopting this Role Statement: \\"The Law Society of Upper Canada exists to govern the legal profession in the public interest by ensuring that the people of Ontario are served by lawyers who meet high standards of learning, competence and professional conduct, and upholding the independence, integrity and honour of the legal profession, for the purpose of advancing the cause of justice and the rule of law.\\" The Law Society faced calls to change the name Upper Canada. Benchers have voted to drop the name and replace it with a new one. On November 2, 2017, the Society's governing body (Convocation) chose \\"Law Society of Ontario\\" as the new name. The name change was made official following amendments to the Law Society Act as part of the 2018 provincial budget implementation bill. In 2019, the Law Society rejected a controversial new regulation requiring all lawyers and paralegals to abide by a statement supporting diversity and inclusion, suggesting the measure was an example of compelled speech, which drew a backlash from some lawyers and journalists and applause from others.  Oversight  Osgoode Hall stained glass window The Law Society regulates the more than 50,000 lawyers in Ontario. It is responsible for ensuring that lawyers are both ethical and competent. The Society has the power to set standards for admission into the profession. It is empowered to discipline lawyers who violate those standards. Available sanctions range from admonitions to disbarment. It is based in Toronto, at Osgoode Hall.  Paralegals  Effective May 1, 2007, as a result of amendments to Ontario's Law Society Act, the Law Society regulates more than 8,000 paralegal licensees in Ontario. Paralegals are licensed to provide limited legal services, such as providing representation before provincial tribunals.  Tribunal decisions  The Law Society Tribunal is an independent adjudicative tribunal within the Law Society of Ontario that processes, hears and decides regulatory cases about Ontario lawyers and paralegals. It was formally created on March 12, 2014, to improve the Law Society‚Äôs hearing process. The Tribunal‚Äôs core values are fairness, quality, transparency and timeliness. It decides a variety of kinds of cases, including alleged misconduct by lawyers and paralegals, whether applicants to be lawyers and paralegals have the required good character to be granted a licence, and alleged incapacity due to health reasons. Tribunal adjudicators, who include benchers and other lawyer, paralegal and lay appointees, are tasked with coming to decisions that are fair, just and in the public interest. Orders, upcoming hearings, and reasons for decisions are all publicly available. David A. Wright is the current Chair of the Law Society Tribunal. Vice-Chairs are Raj Anand (Hearing Division) and Christopher D. Bredt (Appeal Division). Due to COVID-19, most tribunals were held over the telephone.  Treasurer  The Law Society is headed by a Treasurer. He or she is selected by the benchers, who comprise \\"Convocation\\" ‚Äì in effect, the Society's board of directors, as the Society is an Ontario Corporation without share capital. All lawyer- benchers are elected by the Society's members, and eight lay benchers are appointed by the provincial government. The current Treasurer is Malcolm M. Mercer (elected on June 28, 2018), and the current CEO of the Law Society is Diana Miles. Section 12(2) of the Law Society Act, R.S.O. 1990, provides that the Attorney General of Ontario is a bencher of Convocation, while section 13(1) provides that the Attorney General is the \\"Guardian of the Public Interest\\" and, as such, may require the production of any document or thing possessed by the regulator. The regulator falls under the supervision of the Ministry of the Attorney General, according to the ministry's web site. As of 2018, the Law Society has more than 600 staff. It is frequently named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., most recently in 2018.

Later scholars accepted their testimony of the words and deeds of Muhammad, the occasions on which the Quran was revealed and other various important matters of Islamic history and practice. The testimony of the companions, as it was passed down through trusted chains of narrators (isnads), was the basis of the developing Islamic tradition. From the traditions (hadith) of the life of Muhammad and his companions are drawn the Muslim way of life (sunnah), the code of conduct (sharia) it requires, and the jurisprudence (fiqh) by which Muslim communities should be regulated. The two largest Islamic denominations, the Sunni and Shia, take different approaches in weighing the value of the companions' testimonies, have different hadith collections and, as a result, have different views about the ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah. The next generation of Muslims after the ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah, who were born after Muhammad died but knew personally at least one ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah, are called TƒÅbi‚Äò≈´n, and the generation after them, who knew at least one TƒÅbi‚Äò, are called tƒÅbi‚Äò al-tƒÅbi‚Äòƒ´n. The three generations make up the salaf of Islam. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas leads the armies of the Rashidun Caliphate during the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah from a manuscript of the Shahnameh.  Types of ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah  In IslƒÅm, companions of Mu·∏•ammad are classified into categories including the Muhajir≈´n who accompanied Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, the An·π£ƒÅr who lived in Medina, and the Badriyy≈´n who fought at the Battle of Badr. Two important groups among the Companions are the Muhajir≈´n \\"migrants\\", those who had faith in Muhammad when he began to preach in Mecca and who fled with him when he was persecuted there, and the An·π£ƒÅr, the people of Medina who welcomed Muhammad and his companions and stood as their protectors. Lists of prominent companions usually run to 50 or 60 names, the people most closely associated with Muhammad. However, there were clearly many others who had some contact with Muhammad and their names and biographies were recorded in religious reference texts such as ibn Sa'd's early Book of the Major Classes. Al-Qurtubi's Istƒ´ ªƒÅb fƒ´ ma ªrifat al-A·π£hƒÅb, who died in 1071, consists of 2770 biographies of male and 381 biographies of female ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah. According to an observation in al-Qastallani's Al-Muwahib al-Ladunniyyah, an untold number of persons had already converted to Islam by the time Muhammad died. There were 10,000 by the time of the Conquest of Mecca and 70,000 during the Expedition of Tabuk in 630. Some Muslims assert that they were more than 200,000 in number: it is believed that 124,000 witnessed the Farewell Sermon Muhammad delivered after making Farewell Pilgrimage to Mecca. Differing views=Sunni Muslim The most widespread definition of a companion is someone who met Muhammad, believed in him, and died a Muslim. The Sunni scholar ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d.852 H) said, Anyone who died after rejecting Islam and becoming an apostate is not considered as a companion. Those who saw him but held off believing in him until after his passing are not considered ·π£ahƒÅbah but tƒÅbi ª≈´n. . According to Sunni scholars, Muslims of the past should be considered companions if they had any contact with Muhammad, and they were not liars or opposed to him and his teachings. If they saw him, heard him, or were in his presence even briefly, they are companions. All companions are assumed to be just ( ªudul) unless they are proven otherwise; that is, Sunni scholars do not believe that companions would lie or fabricate hadith unless they are proven liars, untrustworthy or opposed to Islam.Muhammad ibn Ahmad (died 1622), also known as \\"Ni≈üancƒ±z√¢de\\", Mir‚Äô√¢t-i k√¢in√¢t (in Turkish): Some Quranic references are important to Sunni Muslim views of the reverence due to all companions;\\"Sharh al-\`Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah\\", by al-Tahawi, p.526-528\\"Al-I\`tiqad \`ala Madhhab al-Salaf Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jama\`a\\", by Al- Bayhaqi, pg.109‚Äì113\\"Al-Tajrid fi Asma' al-Sahaba\\", by Al-Dhahabi, pg.57Word Games With Verse 33:33, By: Ibn al-HashimiMothers of the Believers, By: Ibn al-HashimiAl-Ifk: Quran Defends Aisha, By: Ibn al-Hashimi It sometimes admonishes them, as when Aisha, daughter of the first Sunni caliph Abu Bakr and the wife of Muhammad, was accused of infidelity. Differing views on the definition of a Companion were also influenced by the debate between the Traditionalists and the Mu øtazila with the traditionalists preferring to extend the definition to as many people as possible and the Mu'tazilites preferring to restrict it. Shia Islam The Shia as well as some Sunni scholars like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi and Amin Ahsan Islahi state that not every individual who met or had accidentally seen Muhammad can be considered a Companion. In their view, the Qur ªan has outlined a high level of faith as one of the distinctive qualities of the ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah. Hence, they admit to this list only those individuals who had substantial contact with Muhammad, lived with him, and took part in his campaigns and efforts at proselytizing.Fundamentals of Hadith Interpretation by Amin Ahsan Islahi In other words, Companion is called to sahaba of prophet who be in a long-term relationship with him and support him in essential event up to their death. In view of such admonitions, the Shia have different views on each ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbiyy, depending on what they accomplished. They do not accept that the testimony of nearly all ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah is an authenticated part of the chain of narrators in a hadith and that not all the ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah were righteous just because they saw or were with Muhammad. The Shia further argue that the righteousness of ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah can be assessed by their loyalty towards Muhammad's family after his death and they accept hadith from the Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt, believing them to be cleansed from sin through their interpretation of the Qur ªan and the hadith of the Cloak. Shia Muslims believe that some companions are accountable for the loss of caliphate by the Ali's family. As verses 30-33 from Al-A·∏•zƒÅb, Shias believe their argument that one must discriminate between the virtues of the companions by verses relating to Muhammad's wives.  Bah√° º√≠ Faith  The Bah√° º√≠ Faith recognises the companions of Muhammad. They are mentioned in the Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n, the primary theological work of the Bah√° º√≠ religion. Hadith=Sunni views According to the History of the Prophets and Kings, after the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and the An·π£ƒÅr of Medina held consultations and selected Abu Bakr as the first caliph. Then 'Abd al- Rahman ibn 'Awf and Uthman, companion and son-in-law of Muhammad and also essential chief of the Banu Umayyah, selected Umar as the second caliph after the death of Ab≈´ Bakr and the other An·π£ar and Muhajirun accepted him. Sunni Muslim scholars classified companions into many categories, based on a number of criteria. The hadith quoted above shows ranks of ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah, tƒÅbi‚Äòƒ´n, and tƒÅbi‚Äò at-tƒÅbi‚Äòƒ´n. Al-Suyuti recognized eleven levels of companionship. Shia views Following the consultation of companions about the successor of Muhammad, Shi'i scholars, therefore, deprecate hadith believed to have been transmitted from alleged unjust companions and place much more reliance on hadith believed to have been related by Muhammad's family members and companions who supported Ali. The Shia claim that Muhammad announced his successor during his lifetime at Dawat Zul Asheera then many times during his prophethood and finally at the event of Ghadir Khumm. Shias consider that any hadith where Muhammad is claimed to have absolved all ·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah from sin is a false report by those who opposed the Ahl al-Bayt.

He is sometimes known as Robert FitzPernel. Life Robert was the eldest surviving son of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester and Petronilla de Grandmesnil, who was either a granddaughter or great- granddaughter of Hugh de Grandmesnil. Robert had an elder brother but he died in 1189. As a young man, he accompanied King Richard I on the Third Crusade, and it was while the crusading forces rested at Messina, Sicily that Robert was invested with the Earldom of Leicester on 2 February 1191 in Sicily. (His father had died on his way to the Holy Lands in 1190 at Durazzo .) Robert's newly gained estates included a large part of central Normandy. He held castles at Pacy, Pont-Saint-Pierre and Grandmesnil. Earl Robert also was lord of the vast honor of Breteuil, but the family castle there had been dismantled after the 1173-1174 War. On his return from the crusade, he turned his attentions to the defense of Normandy from the French. After defending Rouen from the advances of Philip II of France, he attempted to retake his castle of Pacy. He was captured by forces of the French king and remained imprisoned for 3 years. Later, King John would bestow the new fortress and lordship of Radepont (the land of Radepont was traded to King John by the seigneur du Neubourg for lands and revenues in the pays de Caux) upon the earl. Sometime after his release in 1196 he married Loretta de Braose, daughter of William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber. They had no children, and Robert's death in 1204 brought the end of the Beaumont male line. In the year of his death Normandy was lost to the French; Earl Robert attempted to come to an independent arrangement with King Philip of France, in which he would hold his land in Normandy as a liege-vassal of the Kings of France, and his lands in England as a liege-vassal of the Kings of England. In any event, Robert died on 20 or 21 October 1204, and his large English estates were divided between the heirs of his two sisters. The eldest sister, Amice, had married the French baron Simon de Montfort, and their son, also named Simon de Montfort, inherited half the estate as well as the title of Earl of Leicester. The younger sister, Margaret, had married Saer de Quincy, and they inherited the other half. Three years later Saer was created Earl of Winchester.

Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works (JFM) designed the plane in the mid-1930s as a so-called Schnellbomber (\\"fast bomber\\") that would be too fast for fighters of its era to intercept. It suffered from technical problems during its development and early operational periods but became one of the most versatile combat aircraft of the war. Like a number of other Luftwaffe bombers, it served as a bomber, dive bomber, night fighter, torpedo bomber, reconnaissance aircraft, heavy fighter and at the end of the war, as a flying bomb.Taylor 1969, p. 178. Despite a protracted development, it became one of the Luftwaffes most important aircraft. The assembly line ran constantly from 1936 to 1945 and more than 15,000 Ju 88s were built in dozens of variants, more than any other twin-engine German aircraft of the period. Throughout production the basic structure of the aircraft remained unchanged.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978 p. 118.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, pp. 118‚Äì119. Design and development In August 1935, the German Ministry of Aviation submitted its requirements for an unarmed, three-seat, high-speed bomber with a payload of .Dressel and Griehl 1994, p. 71. Design of the Ju-88 began with a study (EF59) which evolved into two parallel designs, Ju-85 and Ju-88. The Ju 85 was a twin-engined bomber aircraft prototype, designed by Junkers in 1935. The Ministry of Aviation requested the aircraft, which differed from the Ju 88 due to the use of a twin fin tail unit. The aircraft was never put into service.Suchenwirth 1968, p. 156. Design was initiated by Junkers Chief Designer Ernst Zindel. He was assisted by Wilhelm Heinrich Evers and American engineer Alfred Gassner.Janowicz, Krzysztof, Junkers Ju 88 Vol. I, 2010, Kagero Oficyna Wydawnicza, Lublin, Poland, Evers and Gassner had worked together at Fokker Aircraft Corporation of America where Gassner had been Chief Engineer. Junkers presented their initial design in June 1936, and were given clearance to build two prototypes (Werknummer 4941 and 4942). The first two aircraft were to have a range of and were to be powered by two DB 600s. Three further aircraft, Werknummer 4943, 4944 and 4945, were to be powered by Jumo 211 engines. The first two prototypes, Ju 88 V1 and V2, differed from the V3, V4 and V5 in that the latter three models were equipped with three defensive armament positions to the rear of the cockpit, and were able to carry two bombs, one under each inner wing panel. The aircraft's first flight was made by the prototype Ju 88 V1, which bore the civil registration D-AQEN, on 21 December 1936. When it first flew, it managed about and Hermann G√∂ring, head of the Luftwaffe was ecstatic. It was an aircraft that could finally fulfill the promise of the Schnellbomber, a high-speed bomber. The streamlined fuselage was modeled after its contemporary, the Dornier Do 17, but with fewer defensive guns because the belief still held that it could outrun late 1930s-era fighters. The fifth prototype set a closed-circuit record in March 1939, carrying a payload at a speed of .Winchester 2004, p. 146. Standard Ju 88 main landing gear installation, from the V6 prototype onwards The first five prototypes had conventionally-operating dual-strut leg rearwards-retracting main gear, but starting with the V6 prototype, a main gear design debuted that twisted the new, single-leg main gear strut through 90¬∞ during the retraction sequence, much like that of the American Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter. This feature allowed the main wheels to end up above the lower end of the strut when fully retracted and was adopted as standard for all future production Ju 88s, and only minimally modified for the later Ju 188 and 388 developments of it. These single-leg landing gear struts also made use of stacks of conical Belleville washers inside them as their main form of suspension for takeoffs and landings. By 1938, radical modifications from the first prototype began to produce a \\"heavy\\" dive bomber. The wings were strengthened, dive brakes were added, the fuselage was extended and the number of crewmen was increased to four. Due to these advances, the Ju 88 was to enter the war as a medium bomber. Annular radiator on a wrecked Ju 88 The choice of annular radiators for engine cooling on the Ju 88, which placed these radiators immediately forward of each engine and directly behind each propeller, allowed the cooling lines for the engine coolant and oil-cooling radiators (integrated within the annular design) to be as short as possible, with integral port and starboard air intakes for cooling the exhaust headers, the starboard inlet also supplying the inlet air for the supercharger. Ju 88 assembly line, 1941 As the outbreak of WW II in Europe approached, by the time Luftwaffe planners like Ernst Udet had their opportunities to have their own \\"pet\\" features added (including dive-bombing by Udet), the Ju 88's top speed had dropped to around . The Ju 88 V7 was fitted with cable-cutting equipment to combat the potential threat of British barrage balloons, and was successfully tested in this role. The V7 then had the Ju 88 A-1 \\"beetle's eye\\" faceted nose glazing installed, complete with the Bola undernose ventral defensive machine gun emplacement, and was put through a series of dive- bombing tests with bombs, and in early 1940, with bombs. The Ju 88 V8 (Stammkennzeichen of DG+BF, Wrk Nr 4948) flew on October 3, 1938. The A-0 series was developed through the V9 and V10 prototypes. The A-1 series prototypes were Wrk Nrs 0003, 0004 and 0005. The A-1s were given the Jumo 211B-1 or G powerplants.Dressel and Griehl 1994, p. 75. Dr. Heinrich Koppenberg (managing director of Jumo) assured G√∂ring in the autumn of 1938 that 300 Ju 88s per month was definitely possible. G√∂ring was in favour of the A-1 variant for mass production. Production was delayed drastically by developmental problems. Although planned for a service introduction in 1938, the Ju 88 finally entered squadron service (with only 12 aircraft) on the first day of the invasion of Poland in 1939. Production was painfully slow, with only one Ju 88 manufactured per week, as problems continually kept cropping up. The Ju 88C series of heavy fighter was also designed very early in 1940, but kept secret from G√∂ring, as he only wanted bombers. Dive bomber Three Ju 88s in flight over Astypalaia, Greece, 1943 In October 1937 Generalluftzeugmeister Ernst Udet had ordered the development of the Ju 88 as a heavy dive bomber. This decision was influenced by the success of the Ju 87 Stuka in this role. The Junkers development center at Dessau gave priority to the study of pull-out systems and dive brakes.Dressel and Griehl 1994, p. 74. The first prototype to be tested as a dive bomber was the Ju 88 V4 followed by the V5 and V6. These models became the planned prototype for the A-1 series. The V5 made its maiden flight on 13 April 1938, and the V6 on 28 June 1938. Both the V5 and V6 were fitted with four-blade propellers, an extra bomb bay and a central \\"control system\\". As a dive bomber, the Ju 88 was capable of pinpoint deliveries of heavy loads; however, despite all the modifications, dive bombing still proved too stressful for the airframe, and in 1943, tactics were changed so that bombs were delivered from a shallower, 45¬∞ diving angle. Aircraft and bomb sights were accordingly modified and dive brakes were removed. With an advanced Stuvi dive-bombsight, accuracy remained very good for its time. Maximum bomb load of the A-4 was , but in practice, standard bomb load was .Winchester 2004, p. 147. Junkers later used the A-4 airframe for the A-17 torpedo carrier. However, the variant lacked the undernose Bola gondola for a ventral gun position. Ju 88 preparing for take off, Tunisia, c. 1942‚Äì43 Fighter-bomber The Ju 88C series of standard fighter-bomber versions from the C-2 onwards culminated in the Ju 88 C-6, applying experience acquired with the A-4 bomber, equipped with the same Jumo 211J engines but replacing the \\"beetle's eye\\" nose glazing with a smoothly curved all-metal nose, pierced only by the barrels of its forward-firing offensive armament. The C-6 was used mostly as fighter-bomber and therefore assigned to bomber units. As a reaction to the increasing number of attacks on German shipping, especially on U-boats in the Bay of Biscay, from July 1942 it started flying anti-shipping patrols and escort missions from bases in France.Goss 1997, p. 10. V./Kampfgeschwader 40 being formed to operate the C-6. The aircraft of V./KG 40 (which was redesignated I./Zerst√∂rergeschwader 1 in 1943Goss 1997, p. 121.) were a significant threat to antisubmarine aircraft and operated as escort fighters for the more vulnerable Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor maritime patrol bombers. Between July 1942 and July 1944, the Ju 88s of KG 40 and ZG 1 were credited with 109 confirmed air-to-air victories,Goss 1997, p. 222. at a cost of 117 losses.Goss 1997, p. 242. They were finally deployed against the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, incurring heavy losses for little effect before being disbanded on 5 August 1944.Goss 1997, p. 174.  Attack bomber  The Ju 88P was a specialized variant for ground attack and to function as a bomber destroyer, designed starting from 1942War Machine, Aerospace Publishing, 1983, p. 2374 (from the Italian version, De Agostini, Novara, 1986). and produced in small numbers, using examples of the Bordkanone heavy calibre aviation autocannon series, which required the omission of the Bola undernose gondola for clearance. The prototype, derived from a standard Ju 88 A-4, was armed with a anti-tank gun derived from the 7.5 cm PaK 40 installed in a large conformal gun pod under the fuselage. This was followed by a small batch of Ju 88 P-1, which standardized the solid sheet metal nose of the C version for all known examples of the P-series, and used the new 7.5 cm PaK 40L semi-automatic gun, also known as the Bordkanone BK 7,5,BK 7,5 development which was also meant for use in both the later Henschel Hs 129B-3 dedicated anti-armor aircraft, and a never-achieved production version of the He 177A-3/R5 ground-attack Flak-suppression Stalingradtyp field-improvised version. The Ju 88P-1 was produced in some 40 units, but with the massive cannon installation resulting in a slow and vulnerable aircraft, it was soon replaced by the Ju 88 P-2, featuring two Bordkanone BK 3,7 guns, whose higher muzzle velocity proved useful against the Russian tanks in the Eastern Front. This aircraft was used by Erprobungskommando 25. The Ju 88 P-3 also used the twin BK 3,7 guns, and added further armor for the crew, and was delivered at one Staffel of the Nachtschlachtgruppen 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9 for night attacks in the Eastern Front, in northern Norway (NSGr 8) and Italy (NSGr 9). Finally, the Ju 88 P-4 mounted a smaller-volume ventral gun pod housing a auto-loading Bordkanone BK 5 cannon (the same ordnance used for the field-improvised handful of Stalingradtyp He 177As created) and, in some cases, solid propellant rockets. Heavy fighter and night fighterJu 88C= Ju 88C series heavy fighter in flight The Ju 88C was originally intended as a fighter-bomber and heavy fighter by adding fixed, forward-firing guns to the nose while retaining some bomb carrying ability of the A-series bomber. The C-series had a solid metal nose, typically housing one MG FF cannon and three MG 17 machine guns. The aircraft retained the ventral Bola gondola under the crew compartment though individual units sometimes removed this to reduce weight and drag to enhance performance. The Ju-88C was later used as a night fighter, and this became its main role. The first version of the Ju 88C was the C-1 with 20 aircraft converted from A-1 airframes. Some of them entered service in the Zerst√∂rerstaffel of KG 30 which became part of II./NJG 1 in July 1940. The C-1 was followed by the C-2 of which 20 aircraft were converted from A-5 airframes with enlarged wingspan. The C-4 became the first production version with 60 produced and 60 converted from A-5 airframes. The C-6, of which 900 aircraft were produced, was based on the A-4 airframe with more powerful engines and stronger defensive armament (single- or dual-mount belt- fed MG 81 or MG 131 instead of drum-fed MG 15 machine guns). The Matratze 32-dipole antenna for the Lichtenstein UHF radar The C-6 as night fighter was typically equipped with FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC low-UHF band airborne intercept radar, using the complex 32-dipole Matratze antennas. The first four C-6 night fighters were tested in early 1942 by NJG 2. The trials were successful and the aircraft was ordered into production. In October 1943, many C-6s were upgraded with new radar systems. The first new radar equipment was the FuG 212 Lichtenstein C-1. After the UHF-band Lichtenstein radars had been compromised to the Allies in the late spring of 1943, the next development in German AI radar was the VHF-band FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2, discarding the 32-dipole Matratze antennae for the much larger eight-dipole Hirschgeweih (stag's antlers) aerials, required for the longer wavelength SN-2 system. Many Ju-88C's had their Bola gondolas modified to hold up to two forward firing cannons. Several C-6 night fighters were equipped with two \\"Schr√§ge-Musik\\" upward-firing 20 mm cannons in trial fittings, and from mid 1943 onward, there was an official field modification kit available for this arrangement. A small number of the C-series day fighters had their new solid-metal noses specially painted to resemble the bomber A-series' \\"beetle's eye\\" faceted clear view nose glazing, in an attempt to deceive Allied pilots into thinking the fighters were actually bombers; the unusual \\"camouflage\\" attempt did result initially in a number of Allied aerial losses..

Retrieved: 15 April 2012. =Ju 88R= Ju 88 R-1 night fighter captured by British forces at Copenhagen-Kastrup airfield, May 1945 The Ju 88R series night fighters were basically versions of the Ju 88 C-6, powered by unitized BMW 801 radial engines. The R-1 had BMW 801L engines and the R-2 had BMW 801 G-2 engines. One of the first aircraft from the R-1 series that went into service (Werknummer 360 043) was involved in one of the most significant defections from the Luftwaffe. On 9 May 1943, this night fighter (D5+EV), which was stationed with 10./NJG 3 in Aalborg Denmark, flew to the RAF Station at Dyce (now Aberdeen Airport) with its entire crew and complete electronic equipment on board. The fact that Spitfire Vb fighters No.165 (Ceylon) Squadron escorted it towards the end of its flight could indicate that its arrival had been expected. It was immediately transferred to Farnborough Airfield, received RAF markings and serial number PJ876, and was tested in great detail.Verlag 1994, p. 93. The preserved aircraft is on exhibit at the RAF Museum, as one of the first two intact Ju 88s in aviation museums. The Luftwaffe only learned of this defection the following month when members of the crew, pilot Oberleutnant Heinrich Schmitt (son of the former secretary to the ministry for foreign affairs (1923‚Äì1929) Gustav Stresemann) and Oberfeldwebel Paul Rosenberger made broadcasts on British radio.Scutts 1998, p. 47. The third crew-member, Erich Kantwill, refused to co-operate with the British and was treated as a normal prisoner-of-war. =Ju 88G= All previous night fighter versions of the Ju 88 used a modified A-series fuselage. The G-series fuselage was purpose-built for the special needs of a night fighter, with the A-series' Bola ventral under-nose defensive gun position omitted for lower aerodynamic drag and less weight, and adding the enlarged squared-off vertical fin/rudder tail unit of the Ju 188. G-1 aircraft possessed more powerful armament and like the earlier R-1, used a pair of BMW 801 radial engines, the G-1 using the later BMW 801G-2 version. Electronic equipment consisted of the then-standard FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 90 MHz VHF radar using eight-dipole Hirschgeweih antennas, which could include fitment of the borderline-SHF-band FuG 350 Naxos radar detector with its receiving antenna housed in a teardrop-shaped streamlined fairing above the canopy, or FuG 227 Flensburg radar detector homing devices that had their own trio of twin-dipole antennae: one on each wing leading edge and one under the tail. One Ju 88G-1 of 7. Staffel/NJG 2 was flown by mistake to RAF Woodbridge in July 1944, giving the Royal Air Force its first chance to check out the VHF-band Lichtenstein SN-2 radar and Flensburg radar detector gear.[File:Ju 88 woodbridge.pdf] A British-captured Ju 88 G-6 night fighter equipped with the FuG 240 Berlin cavity magnetron radar, with smooth radome nose G-6 versions were equipped with Jumo 213A inline-V12 engines (using the same redesigned annular radiator cores as the Ju 188s powered by them), enlarged fuel tanks and often one or two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons in a Schr√§ge Musik (\\"Jazz Music\\", i.e. slanted) installation. These guns were pointed obliquely upwards and forwards from the upper fuselage ‚Äì usually at an angle of 70¬∞. Some of the final G-series models received updates to the engines, using a pair of high-altitude Jumo 213E inverted V-12s with the same revised annular radiator design as the 213As already used, or to the radar, using the mid-VHF band FuG 218 Neptun AI radar with either the standardized Hirschgeweih aerials with shorter dipoles to suit the higher frequencies used, or more rarely the advanced Morgenstern 90¬∞ crossed-element, six-dipole Yagi-form antenna. Only a very few Ju 88G-6 night fighters were ever fitted with the semi-experimental FuG 240 Berlin N-1 cavity magnetron based, 3 GHz-band (centimetric) radar, whose dish antenna was housed in a smoothly contoured radome on the G-6's nose. Only about 15 of the Berlin systems were completed before V-E Day. Many Luftwaffe night fighter aces, such as Helmut Lent (110 victories) and Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein (87 victories) flew Ju 88s during their careers. Operational history=Invasion of Poland Only 12 Ju 88s saw action during the invasion of Poland. The unit Erprobungskommando 88 (Ekdo 88) was responsible for testing new bomber designs and their crews under hostile conditions. They selected 12 aircraft and their crews and attached them to 1./Kampfgeschwader 25.Weal 2000, p. 8. As a result of its small operational numbers, the type made no impact. Battle of Norway The Luftwaffe committed II./Kampfgeschwader 30 to the campaign under X. Fliegerkorps for Operation Weser√ºbung.Hooton 2007, p. 32. The unit was equipped with Ju 88s and engaged Allied shipping as its main target. On 9 April 1940, Ju 88s of KG 30 dive-bombed, in cooperation with high-level bombing Heinkel He 111s of KG 26, and helped damage the battleship and sink the destroyer . However, the unit lost four Ju 88s in the action, the highest single loss of the aircraft in combat throughout the campaign.Hooton 2007, p. 34. Battle of France Junkers Ju 88A-1 of the Stab/KG 51, June 1940 Ju 88A, circa 1940 The Luftwaffe's order of battle for the French campaign reveals all but one of the Luftwaffe's Fliegerkorps (I. Fliegerkorps) contained Ju 88s in the combat role. The mixed bomber units, including the Ju 88, of Kampfgeschwader 51 (under the command of Luftflotte 3) helped claim between 233 and 248 Allied aircraft on the ground between 10‚Äì13 May 1940.Hooton 2007, p. 62. The Ju 88 was particularly effective at dive-bombing. Between 13‚Äì24 May, I. and II./KG 54 flew 174 attack against rail systems, paralysing French logistics and mobility.Hooton 2007, p. 66. On 17 June 1940, Junkers Ju 88s (mainly from Kampfgeschwader 30) destroyed a \\"10,000 tonne ship\\", the 16,243 grt ocean liner , off Saint-Nazaire, killing some 5,800 Allied personnel.Hooton 2007, p. 88. Some 133 Ju 88s were pressed into the Blitzkrieg, but very high combat losses and accidents forced a quick withdrawal from action to re-train crews to fly this very high-performance aircraft. Some crews were reported to be more scared of the Ju 88 than the enemy, and requested a transfer to an He 111 unit.Heinkel He 111. Network Projects Production, 1993. By this time, major performance deficiencies in the A-1 led to an all-out effort in a major design rework. The outcome was a longer, wingspan, from extended rounded wing tips that had already been standardised on the A-4 version, that was deemed needed for all A-1s; thus the A-5 was born. Surviving A-1s were modified as quickly as possible, with new wings to A-5 specifications. Battle of Britain A Junkers 88 A-1, of Kampfgeschwader 51 with its crew (1940) By August 1940, A-1s and A-5s were reaching operational units just as the battle was intensifying. The Battle of Britain proved very costly. Its higher speed did not prevent Ju 88 losses from exceeding those of its Dornier Do 17 and Heinkel He 111 stablemates despite being deployed in smaller numbers than either. Ju 88 losses over Britain in 1940 totaled 303 aircraft between July and October 1940. Do 17 and He 111 losses for the same period were 132 and 252 machines destroyed respectively.Aircraft Strength and Losses.Cooksley, Peter G. The Battle of Britain. London: Ian Allan Ltd, 1990. . Of all the losses suffered by the Ju 88 at that time, however, a number were due to the tricky behavior of the plane, especially when compared with the proven He 111, and to the crews' lack of experience on the type ‚Äì many having converted to the Ju 88 only shortly before. Of the 39 losses recorded for July 1940, for example, only 20 were due to enemy action. The others being written off in training accidents, crashes, or malfunctions over mainland Europe. A series of field modifications were made to make the Ju 88 less vulnerable, including the replacement of the single MG 15 rear machine gun by a twin-barreled MG 81Z machine gun and the fitting of additional cockpit armour. One incident involved ground fighting between the crew of an A-1 and soldiers from the London Irish Rifles during the Battle of Graveney Marsh on 27 September 1940. It was the last action between British and foreign military forces on British mainland soil.Green, Ron and Mark Harrison. \\"Forgotten frontline exhibition tells how Luftwaffe fought with soldiers on Kent marshes.\\" KentOnline, 30 September 2009. Retrieved: 21 August 2010. The flagship Ju 88 A-4 went into service during the closing days of the Battle of Britain. Although slower than the A-1, it solved nearly all of the troubles of the A-1. The A-4 actually saw additional improvements including more powerful engines but, unlike other aircraft in the Luftwaffe, did not see a model code change. The Ju 88 C-series also benefited from the A-4 changes. Eastern Front By the summer of 1941, most of the units equipped with the Dornier Do 17 were upgrading to the Ju 88. With a few exceptions, most of the German bomber units were now flying the He 111 and Ju 88. The Ju 88 was to prove a very capable and valuable asset to the Luftwaffe in the east. The Ju 88 units met with instant success, attacking enemy airfields and positions at low level and causing enormous losses for little damage in return. 3./Kampfgeschwader 3 attacked Pinsk airfield in the morning of the 22 June 1941. It caught, and claimed destroyed, 60 Soviet bombers on the ground. The 39 SBAP Regiment of the 10 Division SAD actually lost 43 Tupolev SBa and five Petlyakov Pe-2s. Ju 88s from Kampfgeschwader 51 destroyed over 100 aircraft after dispatching 80 Ju 88s to hit airfields. In general the Soviet aircraft were not dispersed and the Luftwaffe found them easy targets.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 14. A report from the Soviet 23rd Tank Division of the 12th Armoured Corps described a low-level attack by Ju 88s on 22 June, resulting in the loss of 40 tanks. However, the Ju 88s were to suffer steady attritional losses. At 0415 on 22 June 1941, III./KG 51 attacked the airfield at Kurovitsa. Despite destroying 34 Polikarpov I-153s, the Ju 88s were intercepted by 66 ShAP I-153s. Six Ju 88s were shot down before the German fighter escort dealt with the threat.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 16. By the end of the first day of the campaign, Ju 88 losses amounted to 23 destroyed.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 20. LG 1 over the Eastern Front, 25 September 1941 Due to the lack of sufficient numbers of Ju 87 Stukas, the Ju 88 was employed in the direct ground support role. This resulted in severe losses from ground fire. Kampfgeschwader 1, Kampfgeschwader 76 and Kampfgeschwader 77 reported the loss of 18 Ju 88s over enemy territory on 23 June. and KG 77 reported the loss of a further four Ju 88s, of which 12 were 100% destroyed.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 22. In the north, the VVS North-Western Front lost 465 aircraft on the ground, 148 of them bombers, to the Ju 88s of KG 1. A further 33 were damaged. Out of a total of 1,720 aircraft deployed by the VVS Northern Front on 22 June,Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 131. it lost 890 and a further 187 suffered battle damage in eight days.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 29. The Ju 88s units helped virtually destroy Soviet airpower in the northern sector. Again, the Ju 88 demonstrated its dive- bombing capability. Along with He 111s from KG 55, Ju 88s from KG 51 and 54 destroyed some 220 trucks and 40 tanks on 1 July, which helped repulse the Soviet South Western Front's offensive. The Ju 88s destroyed most rail links during interdiction missions in the area, allowing Panzergruppe 1 to maintain the pace of its advance.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 39. Ju 88 units operating over the Baltic states during the battle for Estonia inflicted severe losses on Soviet shipping, with the same dive-bombing tactics used over Norway, France and Britain. KGr 806 sank the Soviet destroyer Karl Marx on 8 August 1941 in Loksa Bay Tallinn.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 36. On 28 August the Ju 88s had more success when KG 77 and KGr 806 sank the 2,026 grt steamer Vironia, the 2,317 grt Lucerne, the 1,423 grt Atis Kronvalds and the ice breaker Kri≈°jƒÅnis ValdemƒÅrs (2,250 grt). The rest of the Soviet \\"fleet\\", were forced to change course. This took them through a heavily mined area. As a result, 21 Soviet warships, including five destroyers, struck mines and sank. On 29 August, the Ju 88s accounted for the transport ships Vtoraya Pyatiletka (3,974 grt), Kalpaks (2,190 grt) and Leningradsovet (1,270 grt) sunk. In addition, the ships Ivan Papanin, Saule, Kazakhstan and the Serp i Molot were damaged. Some 5,000 Soviet soldiers were lost.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 60. Italian Campaign On 2 December 1943, 105 Ju 88 A-4s, armed with bombs and motobomba circling torpedoes, attacked the Allied-held port of Bari, Italy. The attacking force achieved complete surprise and sunk over 20 Allied ships in the overcrowded harbour, including the U.S. Liberty ship John Harvey, which was carrying mustard gas. About 1,000 people were killed and another 1,000 wounded; many fatalities and injuries were as a result of the release of mustard gas. The attacking force lost one aircraft; the Allies had not assigned any fighters to guard Bari as they thought the Luftwaffe incapable of striking in this strength at this stage of the war. The port was completely closed for three weeks from the damage of the raid, and only resumed full operation in February 1944.\\"Tucson Senior Helps Retired Doctor Receive Military Honor\\". Mohave Daily Miner, 20 May 1988. Retrieved: 26 April 2015. Finnish Air Force Finnish Air Force Junkers Ju 88 A-4. The FAF aircraft code for Ju 88 was JK. In April 1943, as Finland was fighting its Continuation War against the USSR, the Finnish Air Force bought 24 Ju 88s from Germany.Stenmann 1995, p. 35. The aircraft were used to equip No. 44 Sqn, which had previously operated Bristol Blenheims, but these were instead transferred to No. 42 Sqn. Due to the complexity of the Ju 88, the FAF spent most of 1943 training crews on the aircraft, and conducted only a handful of bombing missions. The most notable was a raid on the Lehto partisan village on 20 August 1943 (in which the whole squadron participated), and a raid on the Lavansaari air field (leaving seven Ju 88 damaged from forced landing in inclement weather).Stenmann 1995, p. 37. In the summer of 1943, the Finns noted stress damage on the wings. This had occurred when the aircraft were used in dive bombing. Restrictions followed: the dive brakes were removed and it was only allowed to dive at a 45-degree angle (compared to 60‚Äì80 degrees previously). In this way, they tried to spare the aircraft from unnecessary wear. Ju 88 cockpit hood preserved at the Finnish Aviation Museum in Vantaa One of the more remarkable missions was a bombing raid on 9 March 1944 against Soviet Long Range Aviation bases near Leningrad, when the Finnish aircraft, including Ju 88s, followed Soviet bombers returning from a night raid on Tallinn, catching the Soviets unprepared and destroying many Soviet bombers and their fuel reserves, and a raid against the Aerosan base at Petsnajoki on 22 March 1944.Stenmann 1995, p. 37. The whole bomber regiment took part in the defence against the Soviets during the fourth strategic offensive. All aircraft flew several missions per day, day and night, when the weather permitted.Stenmann 1995, pp. 37‚Äì38. No. 44 Sqn was subordinated Lentoryhm√§ Sarko during the Lapland War (now against Germany), and the Ju 88s were used both for reconnaissance and bombing. The targets were mostly vehicle columns. Reconnaissance flights were also made over northern Norway. The last war mission was flown on 4 April 1945.Stenmann 1995, p. 39. After the wars, Finland was prohibited from using bomber aircraft with internal bomb stores. Consequently, the Finnish Ju 88s were used for training until 1948. The aircraft were then scrapped over the following years. No Finnish Ju 88s have survived, but an engine is on display at the Central Finland Aviation Museum, and the frame structure of a German Ju 88 cockpit hood is preserved at the Finnish Aviation Museum in Vantaa.

On 22 July 1943, it was flown to Cyprus by a Romanian pilot who wanted to defect to the British forces on the island. Four Hurricanes from No. 127 Squadron escorted it to the airfield at Tobruk. :Given the name Baksheesh, it was allocated the RAF serial number HK959 and test‚Äìflown in Egypt. However, by this point in the war, the RAF had already acquired three Ju-88s in flying condition and \\"Baksheesh\\" was handed over to the U.S. Army Air Forces, who flew it across the South Atlantic to Wright Field. :In the US, it was registered as FE-1598 and used for examination and test flying from 1943 to 1944. In 1946 the aircraft was placed in storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. It was shipped to the US Air Force Museum on 6 January 1960. It was previously painted in spurious Luftwaffe markings, appropriately of a German WW II Aufkl√§rungsgruppe (reconnaissance group) while on unrestored, outdoor display; however it is presently finished in its original-style Romanian military insignia and is on protected indoor display in the World War II Gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.United States Air Force Museum Guidebook 1975, p. 27.

The defecting crew instead flew west to Scotland while holding the third crewmember at gunpoint. The aircraft was detected by British radar as it approached the Scottish coast and two Spitfires from 165 Squadron were scrambled. They intercepted 360043 one mile inland, whereupon the Ju 88 lowered its undercarriage, dipped its wings and dropped flares, signalling the crew's intent to surrender. The Spitfires escorted 360043 to RAF Dyce, where it received slight damage from the airfield's anti-aircraft guns while attempting to land. The Spitfire pilots (an American and a Canadian) were mentioned in dispatches for taking the risk not to open fire on the Ju 88 upon interception. :The surrender of this aircraft was of great intelligence value at the time, as it was fitted with the latest UHF-band FuG 202 Liechtenstein BC A.I radar, for which a new form of the Window radar interference method, set up for UHF-band airborne radar jamming, was developed soon afterwards. The Ju 88R-1 was operated by the RAF's No. 1426 (Enemy Aircraft) Flight and evaluated in depth by various British groups, including the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the Fighter Interception Unit. It was used to assist in teaching enemy aircraft recognition skills prior to the D-Day landings, and was last flown in May 1945. In September 1954 and again in September 1955, it was displayed on Horseguards Parade for Battle of Britain week. The aircraft was restored in 1975 and fitted with a replica of its characteristic Matratze 32-dipole radar antenna array, as all its radar equipment had been removed during the war. In August 1978, it was moved to the RAF Museum, its present home. Several reasonably intact aircraft have been recovered from underwater and remote land crash sites in recent years; some of these aircraft are under restoration for static display.

Origins  Speakers of Northumbrian Old English settled in south eastern Scotland in the 7th century, at which time Cumbric was spoken in the south of Scotland up to the Forth-Clyde isthmus, and the possibly related Pictish was spoken further north. At the same time Gaelic speakers began to spread from the Western Coast of Scotland north of the Clyde into the east. Over the next five hundred years with the founding of Scotland and spread of Christianity across the north of Britain by the Columban Church the Gaelic language slowly moved eastwards and southwards across the lowlands. When Northumbrian lands were incorporated into Scotland in the 11th century Gaelic became the prestige language there and had some influence, but the south east remained largely English speaking. In the far north, Viking incursions brought Old Norse speakers into Caithness, Orkney and Shetland. Scholars of the language generally use the following chronology:Such chronological terminology is widely used, for example, by Scottish Language Dictionaries Ltd. (Formally SNDA), Dr. Anne King of The University of Edinburgh and by The University of Glasgow . It is also used in The Oxford Companion to the English Language and The Cambridge History of English and American Literature. * (Northumbrian) Old English to 1100 * Pre- literary Scots to 1375 * Early Scots to 1450 * Middle Scots to 1700 * Modern Scots 1700 onwards  Pre-literary Scots  The nature of early forms of the language are obscure due to Viking plundering and destruction, Edward I of England's removal of the national records and their subsequent loss, the destruction of the monasteries in border warfare, and vandalism during the Reformation. It is difficult to assess whether Scots descends largely from the Old English of Lothian or the Anglo-Danish of Yorkshire introduced some four hundred years later, which would explain the Norse elements in Early Scots which are lacking in Northumbrian Old English.Anglo-Danish population movement According to linguist Paul Johnston, Scots descends \\"from a radically restructured, Norse-influence Northumbrian going back to the Danelaw proper as much as from the original dialects of the Bernician settlers.\\" Further Scandinavian influence could have come about through Scotland's trade contacts with Norway. Current insights into pre-literary Scots stem largely from place- names, archaeology and a few words in Latin documents.  Early Scots  Northumbrian Old English had been established in south-eastern Scotland as far as the River Forth by the 7th century. It remained largely confined to this area until the 13th century, continuing in common use while Scottish Gaelic was the court language until displaced by Norman French in the early 12th century. English then spread further into Scotland via the burgh. After the 12th century early northern Middle English began to spread north and eastwards. It was from this dialect that Early Scots, known to its speakers as \\"English\\" (Inglis), began to develop, which is why in the late 12th century Adam of Dryburgh described his locality as \\"in the land of the English in the Kingdom of the Scots\\"\\"in terra Anglorum et in regno Scottorum\\", Adam of Dryburgh, De tripartito tabernaculo, II.210, tr. Keith J. Stringer, \\"Reform Monasticism and Celtic Scotland\\", in Edward J. Cowan & R. Andrew McDonald (eds.), Alba: Celtic Scotland in the Middle Ages, (East Lothian, 2000), p. 133. and why the early 13th century author of de Situ Albanie thought that the Firth of Forth \\"divides the kingdoms of the Scots and of the English\\".A.O. Anderson, Early Sources of Scottish History: AD 500‚Äì1286, 2 Vols, (Edinburgh, 1922), v.i, pp. cxv‚Äìcxix; see also Dauvit Broun, \\"The Seven Kingdoms in De Situ Albanie: A Record of Pictish political geography or imaginary Map of ancient Alba‚Äù, in E.J. Cowan & R. Andrew McDonald (eds.), Alba: Celtic Scotland in the Medieval Era, (Edinburgh, 2000, rev. 2005), pp. 24‚Äì42. Most of the evidence suggests that English spread further into Scotland via the burghsAlex Woolf, From Pictland to Alba, 789 - 1070 (2007: Edinburgh University Press), pp. 292, proto-urban institutions which were first established by King David I. Incoming burghers were mainly English (especially from Northumbria and the Earldom of Huntingdon), Flemish and French. Although the military aristocracy employed French and Gaelic, these small urban communities appear to have been using English as something more than a lingua franca by the end of the 13th century. As a consequence of the outcome of the Wars of Independence though, the English-speaking people of Lothian who lived under the King of Scots had to accept Scottish identity. The growth in prestige of English in the 14th century, and the complementary decline of French in Scotland's Royal Court, made English the prestige language of most of eastern Scotland. Divergence from Northumbrian Middle English was influenced by the Norse of Scandinavian-influenced Middle English-speaking immigrants from the North and Midlands of England during the 12th and 13th centuries, Dutch and Middle Low German through trade and immigration from the low countries, and Romance via ecclesiastical and legal Latin, Norman and later Parisian French due to the Auld Alliance. Some loan words entered the language resulting from contact with Scottish Gaelic, often for geographical features such as ben, glen, crag, loch and strath; however, there are several others like bog from bog (moist or damp), twig (catch on) from tuig (understand), galore (lots of) from gu le√≤r (plenty), boose or buss from bus (mouth), and whisky from uisge-beatha (water of life). Eventually the royal court and barons all spoke Inglis. Further spreading of the language eventually led to Scottish Gaelic being confined mostly to the highlands and islands by the end of the Middle Ages, although some lowland areas, notably in Galloway and Carrick, retained the language until the 17th or 18th century. From the late 14th century even Latin was replaced by Inglis as the language of officialdom and literature.  Middle Scots  By the early 16th century what was then called Inglis had become the language of government, and its speakers started to refer to it as Scottis and to Scottish Gaelic, which had previously been titled Scottis, as Erse (Irish). The first known instance of this was by Adam Loutfut c. 1494. In 1559 William Nudrye was granted a monopoly by the court to produce school textbooks, two of which were Ane Schort Introduction: Elementary Digestit into Sevin Breve Tables for the Commodius Expeditioun of Thame That are Desirous to Read and Write the Scottis Toung and Ane Intructioun for Bairnis to be Learnit in Scottis and Latin. In 1560 an English herald spoke to Mary of Guise and her councillors, at first they talked in the \\"Scottish tongue\\" but because he could not understand they continued in French.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 322. By this time Scots had diverged significantly from its sister south of the border and had become the vehicle for an extensive and diverse national literature. Free variation was a prominent and important feature of the Middle Scots spelling system, however, all writers displayed some greater or lesser degree of consistency in their spelling habits.A History of Scots to 1700 in A Dictionary of Older Scots Vol. 12. Oxford University Press 2002. p. lxxi A literary standard applied but it was less than uniform.http://media.scotslanguage.com/library/document/aitken/Variation_and_variety_in_written_Middle_Scots.pdf From the middle of the 16th century Scots began to become increasingly Anglicized. At the time of King James I, the King James version of the Bible and other editions of the Scripture printed in English became popular. By the late 16th century almost all writing was composed in a mixture of Scots and English spellings, the English forms slowly becoming more common so that by the end of the 17th century Scots spellings had almost disappeared completely. This process took slightly longer in unpublished vernacular literature and official records. After the Union of the Crowns in 1603 the Scots speaking gentry had increasing contact with English speakers and began to remodel their speech on that of their English peers. It was this remodelling that eventually led to the formation of Scottish English. From 1610 to the 1690s during the Plantation of Ulster some 200,000 Scots settled in the north of Ireland taking what were to become Ulster Scots dialects with them. Most of these Scots came from counties in the west of Scotland, such as Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, and Galloway, but others came from the Borders. The Ulster-Scots language has been greatly influenced in pronunciation by Hiberno-English. Additionally, it has loan-words from Irish.  Modern Scots  In the 18th century 'polite society' now considered Scots as 'provincial and unrefined' and much of the gentry endeavoured to rid itself of the former national tongue. Elocutionists such as Thomas Sheridan and John Walker were employed to teach Scots, both in London and Scotland, the formalities of proper English. However, this status was not universally accepted by all educated Scots of the period and a new literary Scots came into being. Unlike Middle Scots, it was usually based on contemporary colloquial speech. Its orthography was generally an adaptation of the imported standard, though some orthographic features from Middle Scots continued to be used. This modern literary Scots was exemplified by Allan Ramsay and his followers, and their successors such as Robert Burns. Many writers and publishers found it advantageous to use English forms and copious apostrophes to secure a larger English readership unfamiliar with Scots. The pronunciation undoubtedly remained Scots as the rhymes reveal. Early in the 19th century the publication of John Jamieson's Etymological Dictionary of the Scots Language was accompanied by a renewed interest in Scots among the middle and upper classes. In this period the absence of an official standard or socially acceptable norm led to further dialect divergence.

Surrounding it are six smaller bronze statues known as \\"The Offering of the Six Devas\\" that are posed offering flowers, incense, lamp, ointment, fruit, and music to the Buddha. These symbolise the Six Perfections of generosity, morality, patience, zeal, meditation, and wisdom, all of which are necessary for enlightenment.

Visitors have to climb 268 steps to reach the Buddha, though the site also features a small winding road for vehicles to accommodate the handicapped. The Buddha's right hand is raised, representing the removal of affliction, while the left rests open on his lap in a gesture of generosity. He faces north, which is unique among the great Buddha statues, as all others face south. There are also three floors beneath the statue: the halls of the Universe, of Benevolent Merit and of Remembrance. One of the most renowned features inside is a relic of Gautama Buddha,John S.

History The Big Buddha was constructed beginning in 1990, and was finished on 29 December 1993, which the Chinese reckon as the day of the Buddha's enlightenment. When the statue was completed, monks from around the world were invited to the opening ceremony. Distinguished visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and the United States all took part in the proceedings.The monastery website On 18 October 1999, the Hong Kong Post Office issued a definitive issue of landmark stamps, of which the HK$2.50 value depicts The Big Buddha.

Some scholars argue these brothers, especially James, held positions of special honor in the early Christian church. Catholic, Assyrian, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Lutherans believe in the perpetual virginity of Mary, as did the Protestant leaders Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Wesley and their respective movements; John Calvin believed it was possible Mary remained a virgin, but believed the scriptural evidence was inconclusive. Those who hold this belief reject the claim Jesus had biological siblings and maintain these brothers and sisters received this designation because of their close association with the nuclear family of Jesus, as either children of Joseph from a previous marriage, or as nephews of either Mary or Joseph.. The literal translation of the words \\"brother\\" and \\"sister\\" is an objective problem because there are few quotations and because the words have various meanings in the family of Semitic languages,Giuseppe Ricciotti, Vita di Gesu Cristo, 3rd ed., Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Milan, 1962: ‚Äòin Hebraic language there is no specific word for our \\"cousin\\". Also, in Hebraic Bible the words \\"brother\\" and \\"sister\\" are frequently used referring to people with very different degree of kinship.‚Äô while the Koine Greek in which the New Testament is written likewise uses the words more broadly.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia p281 ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley In the 3rd century, biological relatives with a connection to the nuclear family of Jesus, without explicit reference to brothers or sisters, were called the desposyni,. from the Greek , plural of , meaning \\"of or belonging to the master or lord\\".. The term was used by Sextus Julius Africanus, a writer of the early 3rd century.  Jesus' brothers and sisters  The Gospel of Mark () and the Gospel of Matthew () mention James, Joseph/Joses, Judas/Jude and Simon as brothers of Jesus, the son of Mary. The same verses also mention unnamed sisters of Jesus. Mark () tells about Jesus' mother and brothers looking for Jesus. A verse in the Epistle to the Galatians (1:19) mentions seeing James, \\"the Lord's brother\\", and none other of the apostles except Peter, when Paul went to Jerusalem after his conversion. The \\"brothers of the Lord\\" are also mentioned, alongside (but separate from) Cephas and the apostles in 1 Corinthians (9:5), in which it is mentioned they had wives. Some scholars claim Jesus' relatives may have held positions of authority in the Jerusalem area until Trajan excluded Jews from the new city he built on its ruins. That the brothers were children of both Mary and Joseph was held by some in the early centuries. The 3rd-century Antidicomarianites (\\"opponents of Mary\\") maintained that, when Joseph became Mary's husband, he was a widower with six children, and he had normal marital relations with Mary, but they later held Jesus was not born of these relations.William H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of Radical Christianity (Scarecrow Press 2012 ), p. 31 Bonosus was a bishop who in the late 4th century held Mary had other children after Jesus, for which the other bishops of his province condemned him.Brackney 2012, p. 57 Jovinian, and various Arian teachers such as Photinus held a similar view. When Helvidius proposed it, again in the late 4th century, Jerome, representing the general opinion of the Church, maintained Mary remained always a virgin; he held those who were called the brothers and sisters of Jesus were actually children of Mary's sister, another Mary, whom he considered the wife of Clopas.. The terms \\"brothers\\" and \\"sisters\\" as used in this context are open to different interpretations,. and have been argued to refer to children of Joseph by a previous marriage (the view of Epiphanius of Salamis), Mary's sister's children (the view of Jerome), or children of Clopas, who according to Hegesippus was Joseph's brother,. and of a woman who was not a sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus (a modern proposal).  As church leaders  Robert W. Funk, founder of the Jesus Seminar, says that according to the Gospel of Mark Jesus' mother and brothers were at first skeptical of Jesus' ministry but later became part of the Christian movement. James, \\"the Lord's brother\\", presided over the Jerusalem church after the apostles dispersed and other kinsmen probably exercised some leadership among the Christians in the area until the emperor Hadrian built Aelia Capitolina on the ruins of Jerusalem and banished all Jews from there (c. 135), after which point the Jerusalem Christians were entirely of Gentile origin.. Traditionally it is believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars (66‚Äì135) in Pella in the Decapolis. The Jerusalem Sanhedrin relocated to Jamnia sometime c. 70. According to The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, when Peter the Apostle left Jerusalem, it was James who became leader of the church in Jerusalem and was held in high regard by the Jewish Christians.. Hegesippus reports he was executed by the Sanhedrin in 62. Sextus Julius Africanus's reference to \\"desposyni\\" (blood relatives of Jesus related to his nuclear family) is preserved in Eusebius of Caesarea's Ecclesiastical History:. Eusebius has also preserved an extract from a work by Hegesippus (c.110‚Äìc.180), who wrote five books (now lost except for some quotations by Eusebius) of Commentaries on the Acts of the Church. The extract refers to the period from the reign of Domitian (81‚Äì96) to that of Trajan (98‚Äì117), and includes the statement that two Desposyni brought before Domitian later became leaders of the churches:.  Degree of consanguinity between Jesus and his brothers  The New Testament names James the Just, Joses, Simon, and Jude as the brothers (Greek adelphoi) of Jesus (, , , , ).  Etymology  The etymology of the Greek word for \\"brother\\" (adelphos) is ‚Äúof the same womb,‚Äù a-delphys, although in New Testament usage, the Christian and Jewish meaning of \\"brothers\\" is wider, and is applied even to members of the same religious community. In the Bible, the Greek words adelphos and adelphe were not restricted to their literal meaning of a \\"full brother\\" or \\"sister,\\" and nor were their plurals.Bethel (1907) From an early date, there were varied discussions to interpret whether the Greek term adelphos‚Äîapplied in these circumstances to people described as adelphoi of Jesus‚Äîmeant that they were full brothers, half-brothers, stepbrothers, or cousins. To support his view, the fourth-century Christian writer, Helvidius, quoted Tertullian, and claimed the adelphoi were children of Mary and Joseph born after Jesus; yet, Jerome rebutted that Tertullian did ‚Äúnot belong to the Church,‚Äù and argued that the adelphoi were Jesus' cousins. Some scholars consider Helvidius' view as the most natural inference from the New Testament. The perspective is asserted through the occasional mention of James (Jacob Iakobos), the oldest of the brothers, who acquired the name of Joseph's father (also James, Iakobos in the Solomonic genealogy of Jesus in Matthew). This appeared contrary to conventional Biblical-era practices, where the grandson periodically received the name of the grandfather.. The term adelphos (brother in general) is distinct from anepsios (cousin, nephew, niece). In his Christian writings from the second century, Hegesippus differentiated between those who were the anepsioi or adelphoi of Jesus. However, the native language of Jesus and his disciples was Aramaic (as in ; ), which could not distinguish between a blood brother or sister and a cousin. Aramaic, like Biblical Hebrew, does not contain a word for \\"cousin.\\" In Aramaic and Hebrew, which were inclined to use circumlocutions to indicate blood relationships, people who were referred to as ‚Äúbrothers of Jesus‚Äù would not have always implied the same biological mother. This perception is asserted by scholars and theologians, who observe that Jesus was called ‚Äúthe son of Mary,‚Äù rather than ‚Äúa son of Mary‚Äù in his birthplace ().  Relationship of Jesus' brothers to Mary  By the 3rd century, the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary had become well established; important early Christian theologians such as Hippolytus (170‚Äì235), Eusebius (260/265‚Äì339/340) and Epiphanius (c. 310/320‚Äì403) defended it. By then the early church did not accept Mary had any children apart from Jesus. Eusebius and Epiphanius held these men were Joseph's sons from (an unrecorded) former marriage. Epiphanius adds Joseph became the father of James and his three brothers (Joses, Simeon, Judah) and two sisters (a Salome and a Mary or a Salome and an Anna) with James being the elder sibling. James and his siblings were not children of Mary but were Joseph's children from a previous marriage. Joseph's first wife died; many years later, at the age of eighty, \\"he took Mary (mother of Jesus)\\". According to Epiphanius the Scriptures call them \\"brothers of the Lord\\" to confound their opponents. Origen (184‚Äì254) also wrote \\"according to the Gospel of Peter the brethren of Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former wife, whom he married before Mary\\". The apocryphal History of Joseph the Carpenter, written in the 5th century and framed as a biography of Joseph dictated by Jesus, describes how Joseph had with his first wife four sons and two daughters. His sons' names were Judas, Justus, James, and Simon, and the names of the two daughters were Assia and Lydia. Years after his first wife died, he took Mary. Therefore, the brothers of Jesus would be the children of Joseph by his first wife. The Protoevangelium of James explicitly claims Joseph was a widower, with children, at the time that Mary is entrusted to his care. The Catholic Encyclopedia, citing the texts contained in the apocryphal writings, writes that: Jerome (c. 347‚Äì420), another important early theologian, also held the perpetual virginity doctrine, but argued these adelphoi were sons of Mary's sister, whom Jerome identified as Mary of Cleopas.. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church mentions a modern scholar, whom it does not identify, has proposed these men were the sons of Clopas (Joseph's brother according to Hegesippus) and of Mary, the wife of Cleopas (not necessarily referring to Jesus' mother's sister). According to the surviving fragments of the work Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord of the Apostolic Father Papias of Hierapolis, who lived circa 70‚Äì163 AD, \\"Mary the wife of Cleophas or Alphaeus\\" would be the mother of James the Just, Simon, Judas (identified as Jude the Apostle), and Joseph (Joses). Papias identifies this \\"Mary\\" as the sister of Mary, mother of Jesus, and thus as the maternal aunt of Jesus. The Anglican theologian J.B. Lightfoot dismissed Papias' evidence as spurious. The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, which was probably written in the seventh century, states the brothers of Jesus were his cousins. Roman Catholic and Eastern Christianity maintained the doctrine of Early Christianity that Mary was a perpetual virgin;. early Protestant leaders, including the Reformer Martin Luther,. and Reformed theologian Huldrych Zwingli, also held this view, as did John Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism.. Eine Christliche Lehrtafel (A Christian Catechism), issued by Anabaptist leader Balthasar Hubmaier, teaches the perpetual virginity of the Virgin Mary too. Roman Catholics, following Jerome, conclude that the adelphoi were Jesus' cousins, while Eastern Orthodox, following Eusebius and Epiphanius, argue they were Joseph's children by his (unrecorded) first wife. But the Catholic Church only defined a doctrine that they are not biological children of Mary; their exact status, either as cousins or stepbrothers (children of Joseph), is not defined as a doctrine. Anglicans, Lutherans, and Methodists concur with this view. Other Christian denominations, such as Baptists, view the adelphoi as Jesus' half- brothers or do not specify, since the accounts in the Gospels do not speak of Mary's relationship to them but only to Jesus... The term \\"half brother\\" is used to denote parentage, not genetics. In this view, the other brothers and sisters listed in the Gospel passages would have the same relationship to Jesus. However, some Protestants reject the term \\"half brother\\" because it is too specific; the Gospel accounts refer to these relatives as brothers and sisters of Jesus, without specifying their parents, and refer to Mary only in relation to Jesus. Certain critical scholars of the Jesus Seminar say the doctrine of perpetual virginity has obscured recognition that Jesus had full brothers and sisters. In the Hebrew Book of Genesis, all the other sons of Jacob are repeatedly called brothers of Joseph, although they were children of different mothers.For instance, in 16 of the 36 verses of the chapter . Similarly, Abram (of Terah) called his nephew Lot a brother.For instance, in 8 of the 18 verses of the chapter . Also, the Second Book of Samuel describes Tamar as a sister both of Amnon and of Absalom,. two of David's sons by different mothers..  Family trees and pedigrees  Explanations of the true relationship of the \\"brothers\\" of Jesus within his immediate nuclear family fall primarily into several categories. The first, called \\"the most natural inference from the New Testament\\" by the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, is that the brothers of Jesus may have been sons of Mary and Joseph, born after Christ: Because of the conflict of this reconstruction with the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary, several alternatives are common. Epiphanius made them children of Joseph by a former marriage: Other reconstructions would make them more distant relatives, the children of 'Mary, mother of James and Joses' by Clophas, though these are linked to Mary and Joseph in different ways. St. Jerome would have this Mary be a sister of the Virgin Mary: A modern reconstruction would likewise make them cousins, but rather than having the two Marys be siblings, it would follow Hegesippus in making Clophas brother of Joseph:  Rejection of Jesus  According to the Synoptic Gospels, and particularly the Gospel of Mark, Jesus was once teaching a large crowd near the home of his own family, and when this came to their attention, his family went to see him and \\"they\\" (not specified) said that Jesus was \\"‚Ä¶out of his mind.\\" In the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels, and of the Gospel of Thomas, when Jesus' mother and adelphoi are outside the house that Jesus is teaching in, Jesus tells the crowd that whoever does what God wills would constitute his mother and adelphoi. According to Kilgallen, Jesus' answer was a way of underlining that his life had changed to the degree that his family were far less important than those that he teaches about the Kingdom of God. The Gospel of John states that Jesus' adelphoi did not believe in him, because he would not perform miracles with them at the Feast of Tabernacles. Some scholars have suggested the portrayal in the Gospel of Mark of the initial rejection of Jesus by his family may be related to the tension between Paul and Jewish Christians, who ‚Äì according to them ‚Äì held Jesus' family in high regard, for example at the Council of Jerusalem..... Karl Keating says that in Jewish culture younger brothers (blood siblings) never rebuked, or even advised, their elders, for it was considered great disrespect to do so; but in Mark 3:21, also in John 7:3‚Äì4, Jesus' brothers are shown doing that.  Absence of Jesus' brothers  There are some events in scripture where brothers or sisters of Jesus are not shown, e.g., when Jesus was lost in the Temple and during his crucifixion. This is argued to support the view that \\"brothers\\" of Jesus are not blood brothers or siblings, although some reject this. reports the visit of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem when Jesus was 12 years old but does not mention any siblings. Robert Eisenman is of the belief Luke sought to minimise the importance of Jesus' family by whatever means possible, editing James and Jesus' brothers out of the Gospel record.. Keating argues Mary and Joseph rushed without hesitation straight back to Jerusalem when they realized Jesus was lost, which they would surely have thought twice about doing if there were other children (Jesus' blood brothers or sisters) to look after. The Gospel of John records the sayings of Jesus on the cross, i.e., the pair of commands \\"Woman, behold your son!\\" and \\"Behold, thy mother!\\" (), then states \\"from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home\\". Since the era of the Church Fathers this statement has been used to reason that after the death of Jesus there were no other biological children to look after Mary, and she had to be entrusted to the disciple.Arthur B. Calkins, \\"Our Lady's Perpetual Virginity,\\" in Mark Miravalle, ed. (2008), Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons pp. 308‚Äì309Mark Miravalle, 1993, Introduction to Mary, Queenship Publishing , pp. 62‚Äì63Fundamentals of Catholicism, Kenneth Baker 1983 pp. 334‚Äì35 Constantine Zalalas argues it would have been against Jewish custom for Jesus to give his mother to the care of the disciple if Mary had other living sons, because the eldest son would always take responsibility for his mother.. Karl Keating says, \\"It is hard to imagine why Jesus would have disregarded family ties and made this provision for his Mother if these four [James, Joseph/Joses, Simon, Jude] were also her sons\\". Pope John Paul II also says the command \\"Behold your son!\\" was the entrustment of the disciple to Mary in order to fill the maternal gap left by the death of her only son on the cross.L'Osservatore Romano, weekly ed. in English, 30 April 1997, p. 11 Article at EWTN Vincent Taylor points out difficulties in this interpretation of the text: it ignores both the fact that Jesus' brothers opposed his claims, and the position of honour of John, the beloved disciple.

Design and development In 1928, the French Air Ministry issued a specification for a four-seat Multiplace de Combat, a multi-seat combat aircraft to act as a light bomber, reconnaissance aircraft and long-range escort fighter. Amiot received an order for two prototype Amiot 140s, to be evaluated against the competing Bleriot 137, Breguet 410 and SPCA 30.Air International December 1988, p. 306. The Amiot 140 was a high-winged cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, with corrugated wing skinning and a fixed tail wheel undercarriage. The pilot sat in an open cockpit, with cockpits for gunners in the nose and dorsal positions. A glazed gondola under the forward fuselage carried a bombardier/gunner, ensuring that the gunners had a clear field of fire all around the aircraft.Flight 12 December 1930, pp. 1434‚Äì1436. The Amiot was intended to be powered by two 515 kW (690 hp) Lorraine 18G Orion water-cooled W engines but these were unavailable and the first prototype was fitted with Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr engines to allow flight testing, making its maiden flight on 12 April 1931.Air International December 1988, pp. 306‚Äì307. The second prototype was completed in February 1932 but the continued non-availability of its intended engines, either the original Lorraine-Dietrichs or turbocharged Hispano-Suizas, meant that it never flew. Despite this, on 23 November 1933 an order was placed for 40 Amiot 140s, to be powered by 662 kW (880 hp) Lorraine 12Q Eider engines. The French Air Ministry had meanwhile revised its requirements, concentrating on the bombing role and asking for better performance. Amiot redesigned the aircraft to meet these requirements and incorporate lessons learned during testing of the Amiot 140. The gondola under the fuselage was enlarged, allowing easier operation of the aircraft's guns and a fifth crew member (a radio-operator) to be carried. Manually operated gun turrets were provided in the nose and dorsal positions. Orders were placed for two prototypes, differing only in the engines fitted, with the Amiot 142 having Hispano-Suiza 12Y engines and the Amiot 143 having Gnome-Rhone 14K radial engines. The 143 flew first, on 1 August 1934, with the 142 not flying until January 1935.Air International December 1988, pp. 307‚Äì308. As it was decided to allocate the Hispano-Suiza engines to fighters, the Amiot 143 was selected,Breffort and Jouneau 2004, p. 12. the existing order for 40 Amiot 140s being converted to 143s.Air International December 1988, p. 308. The Amiot 143 had the same high-wing and fixed undercarriage as the Amiot 140, with the wing thick enough to allow crew access to the engines by a tunnel between the wing spars. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit, level with the leading edge of the wing and the navigator-bombardier, who was also provided with flying controls, sat in the extensively glazed gondola beneath the pilot. The radio operator sat towards the rear of the gondola and in early aircraft operated two 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Lewis guns. Nose and dorsal turrets, each carrying a Lewis gun, completed the defensive armament, while the gondola also housed an internal bomb-bay. After 40 aircraft had been completed, the design was revised, with the aircraft being fitted with a longer nose (increasing overall length from 17.94 m (58 ft 10 in) to 18.24 m (59 ft 10 in), a revised fuel system and with the Lewis guns in the nose, dorsal turrets and ventral position replaced by single 7.5 mm (.295 in) MAC 1934 machine guns, with a fourth gun used by the navigator-bombardier firing through a hatch in the floor.Air International December 1988, pp. 309‚Äì310.Green 1967, pp. 78‚Äì79. Deliveries of the aging design eventually began in April 1935, continuing until March 1937, with a total of 138 being built.Green 1967, p. 79. An improved version, the Amiot 144 was built to meet 1933 requirement for a Multiplace de Combat, combining the same fuselage and a similar wing with a retractable undercarriage. First flying on 18 January 1936, only one was built.Green 1967, p. 80. Operational history The Amiot 143M entered service in July 1935, with deliveries continuing in 1936 and 1937. About six were going to be delivered to the Spanish Republican Air Force at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War; New revised edition (2011) There is no evidence, however, that these obsolete French bombers flew over Spain during the Civil War. By the time the last deliveries were made in March 1938, the Amiot was quite out of date and began to be replaced by modern aircraft such as the Bloch MB.131.Air International December 1988, pp. 311‚Äì312. Nevertheless, at the outbreak of the Second World War, Amiot 143s equipped 5 metropolitan groupes together with a single African based groupe.Air International December 1988, p. 312. During the Phoney War, Amiot 143M groupes carried out reconnaissance and leaflet raids over Germany. 87 Amiot 143M remained in front line service on 10 May 1940, 50 equipping four metropolitan groupes: GBs I/34 and II/34 in the north, GBs I/38 and II/38 in the East and 17 equipping one African groupe, GB II/63, which was in the process of re-equipping with Martin 167Fs.B√©nichou Le Fana de l'Aviation July 1997, p. 46. Following the start of the Battle of France, the Amiot 143M was mainly used in night attacks against German airfields and lines of communications, with losses relatively low.Green 1967, p. 82.Air International December 1988, p. 313. One notable exception was a daylight raid by 10 Amiots from GBs I/34, II/34 and II/38 led by Commandant de Laubier against German bridgeheads near Sedan on 14 May 1940. Despite fighter escort, two Amiots were shot down while a third force-landed before reaching its base.Robineau, Lucien. \\"L‚ÄôAVIATION DE BOMBARDEMENT FRAN√áAISE EN MAI 1940\\" . p.5. En souvenir du commandant de Laubier. January 2010. Retrieved 21 May 2011. By the Armistice, the Amiot 143M had dropped a total of 474 tonnes (523 tons) of bombs. 52 Amiot 143Ms were in the Unoccupied Zone and 25 were in French North Africa.B√©nichou Le Fana de l'Aviation July 1997, p. 52. They were reorganized into GBs I/38 and II/38 and were used until July 1941 when they were replaced by LeO 451 bombers. Some planes of II/38 served as transports for the French in Syria. This groupe later went over to the Allies after their landings in Africa. The last Amiot 143M was retired from service in February 1944. A few Amiot 143M are reported to have been commandeered by the Germans and used as transports. Only 11 were left in the Unoccupied Zone when it was occupied by the Germans in 1943 and only three were flightworthy. Had the war gone on a little longer for France, it is likely that all of the Amiot 143M would have ended up in a training role, having been replaced by more modern bombers such as the Breguet 693. The obsolete plane was never intended to have such an important role come war time, but slow French production made its use necessary ‚Äì often being pulled from training squadrons to shore up bomber groupes.

The aircraft was powered by two 960 PS (947 hp, 720 kW) BMW 132K nine-cylinder air-cooled radial engines. Some later models could seat four, had different engines or used different weapon arrangements. Development and design In 1935, the German Reich Air Ministry (RLM, Reichsluftfahrtministerium) produced a requirement for a twin engined general purpose floatplane, suitable for patrol and for anti-shipping strikes with bombs and torpedoes. Proposals were received from Heinkel Flugzeugwerke and from the Blohm & Voss aircraft subsidiary Hamburger Flugzeugbau. On 1 November 1935, orders were placed with Heinkel and Hamburger Flugzeugbau for three prototypes each of their prospective designs, the He 115 and the Ha 140.Air International February 1987, p.97.Donald 1994, p.108. The first prototype Heinkel flew in August 1937, testing was successful and the He 115 design was selected over the Ha 140 early in 1938, leading to an order for another prototype and 10 pre-production aircraft. The first prototype was used to set a series of international records for floatplanes over and closed circuits at a speed of .Air International February 1987, p.96. Armament initially consisted of two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 machine guns, one in the nose and one in the dorsal position. Later He 115s were fitted with a fixed forward-firing 15 mm or 20 mm MG 151 cannon and two rearward-firing 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns in the engine nacelles.Air International February 1987, p.101.Air International March 1987, p.155. He 115 variants carried LTF 5 or LTF 6b torpedoes and SD 500 or SC 250 bombs. Some also carried LMB III or LMA mines. Operational history=Luftwaffe A German Heinkel He 115B of 1./K√ºstenfliegergruppe 206 on a crane. At the beginning of the war, the He 115 was used for dropping parachute mines in British waters, normally aiming for narrow passages close to busy ports on the English south coast; the River Thames was also a prime target. The aircraft had its finest moment on anti- shipping operations against Arctic convoys from bases in northern Norway. Because the first convoys lacked air cover, the slow and lightly armed He 115 was less vulnerable than near the English coast. With the appearance of carriers and escort carriers, coupled with new Soviet heavy fighters like the Petlyakov Pe-3bis, Luftwaffe air superiority over the convoys was challenged and losses increased. He 115 shot down by de Havilland Mosquito. Apart from its use as a minelayer and torpedo bomber, the He 115 was used for coastal reconnaissance and by KG 200 to drop agents behind enemy lines. Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service Norwegian He 115Ns in 1939‚Äì1940. In response to the rising tensions in Europe, the Norwegian Ministry of Defence had ordered six He 115Ns for the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service (RNoNAS) on 28 August 1939 and the aircraft were delivered from 14 July ‚Äì 13 November 1939.Luftwaffe.no: Heinkel He 115 in Norway The He 115N order was intended to replace the RNoNAS fleet of 1920s vintage Douglas DT torpedo bombers and the obsolescent Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11, which was the mainstay of the RNoNAS in 1940.Hafsten 2003: 87‚Äì90 The Norwegians signed another order of six He 115Ns in December 1939, with delivery expected in March/April 1940 but this was forestalled by Operation Weser√ºbung, the German invasion of Norway of 9 April 1940. At the outbreak of hostilities, the RNoNAS had six He 115Ns in service (F.50, F.52, F.54, F.56, F.58 and F.60) spread along the coast from the naval air stations at Sola and Flat√∏y in the south to the one at Skatt√∏ra Naval Air Station outside Troms√∏ in the north. At the beginning of the German invasion, the aircraft at the seaplane base at Hafrsfjord near Stavanger (F.60) was captured by the Germans, but two Luftwaffe He 115s (given the codes F.62 and F.64 in Norwegian service) were seized by an improvised militia unit of Norwegian riflemen at √òrnes in Glomfjord, Nordland and by police officers at Br√∏nn√∏ysund, Nordland. The two aircraft were seized after they ran out of fuel and had to make emergency landings on 10 April. Manned by Norwegian aircrews, they served against their former owners for the duration of the campaign. Seven Norwegian He-115s, five of them He-115Ns, were employed against German and German-controlled ships (see: HNoMS Uller), as well as providing ground support to the Norwegian Army offensive on the Narvik Front. On 14 April 1940, three Norwegian He 115s made a successful attack on German Ju 52s at Gullesfjordbotn. Four of the Norwegian aircraft (F.52, F.56, F.58 and F.64) made the journey to the United Kingdom shortly before the 10 June 1940 surrender, a fifth (F.50) escaping to Finland, landing on Lake Salmij√§rvi in Petsamo.FAF in Color: Finnish Air Force Aircraft: Heinkel He 115 A sixth He 115 (F.54) also tried to make the journey to Britain but was lost over the North Sea. The last of the Norwegian He 115s, F.62 (one of the two captured German aircraft), was unserviceable at the time of the evacuation and was abandoned at Skatt√∏ra, later being repaired and flown by the Germans. Royal Air Force The four escaped aircraft were reformed into the Norwegian Helensburgh Group under Commander Bugge. The exiled Norwegian Cabinet Nygaardsvold made plans soon after arriving in Britain to use the four He 115 aircraft to perform leaflet dropping missions over Norway. The leaflet mission was to deliver a declaration to the Norwegian people, stating the Norwegian authorities were re-established in the UK and rejected any Nazi German overtures for a German‚ÄìNorwegian peace deal. All four Norwegian He 115s were ordered from Helensburgh to Scapa Flow on 3 July 1940 to carry out the mission, although one had to return to Helensburgh due to engine problems. The three He 115s assembled at Scapa Flow were ordered to fly to Norway and drop the declaration over the cities of Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim. Shortly before the mission was to get under way the British Air Ministry intervened and stopped the expedition, insisting that such an undertaking would be suicidal to attempt with the slow flying He 115s. Three days later, the aircraft returned to Helensburgh.Hafsten 1991, p. 297 Three of the Norwegian He 115s (F.56, F.58 and F.64) were subsequently used in covert operations off Norway and in the Mediterranean Sea with Norwegian crews. In British service, the three received new serial numbers, BV184, BV185 and BV187. BV184 was attacked and damaged by two Polish Spitfire fighters over the Bay of Biscay in the spring of 1942, while co-operating with French fishing boats and later lost in a refuelling fire in the UK.Berg 1997: 93 BV185 was destroyed in an Italian air raid on Kalafrana, Malta after flying just one clandestine operation to North Africa. BV187 flew several missions on the North African coast from its base in Malta before being destroyed by two German Bf 109s. Finnish Air Force Heinkel He 115A of LeLv 15 on lake H√∂yti√§inen. August 1941. On 8 June 1940, the day after Norwegian forces were ordered to cease hostilities, one He 115 (F.50, deemed technically unfit to be flown to UK), was flown to Finland posing as a civilian aircraft LN-MAB. The float-plane was interned but the pilot, experienced line captain and naval lieutenant Helge Dahl and crew were free to leave Finland. From Summer 1941 it was used by the LLv.14 of the Finnish Air Force code HE-115 and named \\"Jenny\\", to ferry Sissi troops behind Soviet lines. In this role, it proved valuable in a terrain with numerous secluded lakes. It served in this role until ambushed in East Karelia on 4 July 1943. Jenny took off but soon had to ditch and the crew was taken prisoner. Two days later the floating HE-115 was strafed by Finnish Morane- Saulnier MS406 fighters. There are reports that the Soviets salvaged the wreck for evaluation. Two Luftwaffe He 115 C were borrowed for similar operations in 1943‚Äì44 and operated with German markings by Finnish crew. One was returned in 1944 but the other was surrendered to the Soviets after armistice. Swedish Air Force The Swedish Air Force operated 12 He 115A-2s under the local designation T 2, with Air Force numbers 101‚Äì112. Another six aircraft were ordered but never delivered due to the outbreak of World War II. They were sturdy and well liked by their crews and were not taken out of use until 1952. The Swedish T 2s were kept on duty throughout World War II and made a valuable contribution to protecting and enforcing Swedish neutrality. The T 2s replaced the outdated T 1s (Heinkel HD 16s) as torpedo bombers and also served as regular bombers, for smoke screening and for long-range reconnaissance missions. Five of the 12 T 2s were lost in accidents during their service with the Swedish Air Force.Avrosys.nu: T 2 - Heinkel He 115 (1939-1952) Variants=Prototypes Five prototypes were used in the development of the aircraft, * He 115 V1 August 1937, set eight payload/speed records * He 115 V2 November 1937, similar to V1 * He 115 V3 March 1938, introduced glassed cockpit, which became standard * He 115 V4 May 1938, production prototype, introduced struts in place of wires between fuselage and floats * He 115 V5 1939 Production The basic design of the aircraft remained unchanged during the type's career.

Genres may be determined by literary technique, tone, content, or even (as in the case of fiction) length. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups. Even the rules designating genres change over time and are fairly unstable. The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) epic, tragedy,Bakhtin 1983, p. 3. comedy, and creative nonfiction. They can all be in the form of prose or poetry. Additionally, a genre such as satire, allegory or pastoral might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre (see below), but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general cultural movement of the historical period in which they were composed. Genre should not be confused with age categories, by which literature may be classified as either adult, young adult, or children's. They are also not the same as 'format', such as graphic novel or picture book subgenre. Genres William Shakespeare's statue Various types of literary works exist, which share specific conventions. Genres are often divided into subgenres. Literature is subdivided into the classic three forms of Ancient Greece, poetry, drama, and prose. Poetry may then be subdivided into the genres of lyric, epic, and dramatic. The lyric includes all the shorter forms of poetry, e.g., song, ode, ballad, elegy, sonnet.\\"Genres\\", A Guide to the Study of Literature: A Companion Text for Core Studies 6, Landmarks of Literature, English Department, Brooklyn College Dramatic poetry might include comedy, tragedy, melodrama, and mixtures like tragicomedy. The standard division of drama into tragedy and comedy derives from Greek drama. This parsing into subgenres can continue: comedy has its own subgenres, including, for example, comedy of manners, sentimental comedy, burlesque comedy, and satirical comedy. Often, the criteria used to divide up works into genres are not consistent, and may change constantly, and be subject of argument, change and challenge by both authors and critics. However, even a very loose term like fiction (\\"literature created from the imagination, not presented as fact, though it may be based on a true story or situation\\") is not universally applied to all fictitious literature, but instead is typically restricted to the use for novel, short story, and novella, but not fables, and is also usually a prose text. Semi- fiction spans stories that include a substantial amount of non-fiction. It may be the retelling of a true story with only the names changed. The other way around, semi-fiction may also involve fictional events with a semi-fictional character, such as Jerry Seinfeld. Genres may easily be confused with literary techniques, but, though only loosely defined, they are not the same; examples are parody, frame story, constrained writing, stream of consciousness.

He was Chief Judge from November 2006 to October 2013, and has been a judge on the court since 1985. Early life and education Easterbrook was born in Buffalo, New York on September 3, 1948, the son of Vimy and George Easterbrook. His younger brothers are author Gregg Easterbrook and Neil Easterbrook, a professor at Texas Christian University. Frank Easterbrook attended Kenmore West High School in Tonawanda New York, and Swarthmore College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and received his Bachelor of Arts degree with high honors. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago Law School (where he was an editor of the law review with Douglas H. Ginsburg and a member of the Order of the Coif) in 1973, and then clerked for Judge Levin Hicks Campbell on the First Circuit. Early career In 1974, along with Danny Boggs, he joined the United States Solicitor General's office as an Assistant to the Solicitor General, and was promoted in 1978 to Deputy Solicitor General. The solicitor general at the time was Robert Bork, and Easterbrook has reminisced that when he joined the Solicitor General's office, \\"The Washington Post noted that around the same time the SG's Office had hired three lawyers either fresh from clerkships or lacking the customary appellate experience. None of us had clerked on the Supreme Court. The Post concluded that good lawyers were no longer willing to work for the Solicitor General and attributed this to Bork's role in firing Archibald Cox as Watergate special prosecutor. The paper thought that dark days lay ahead for the Office with a second-rate staff. The three bottom-of-the-barrel selections were Robert Reich (later Secretary of Labor in the Clinton Administration), Danny Boggs (future Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit), and me.\\" Easterbrook was considered \\"one of the very top advocates appearing before the Supreme Court in his days at the bar\\". Easterbrook joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1978 (and is still a senior lecturer there today), and was a principal at Lexecon from 1980 until his judicial appointment. Easterbrook argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court while in the Solicitor General's office and in private practice, including several landmark antitrust cases. Nomination and judicial career Easterbrook was nominated to the court by Ronald Reagan on August 1, 1984 to a new seat created by 98 Stat. 333, 346; the United States Senate did not act on his nomination that year, and he was renominated in Reagan's second term on February 25, 1985. He was confirmed by the Senate on April 3, 1985, and received his commission the next day. The American Bar Association gave Easterbrook a low \\"qualified/not qualified\\" rating, presumably due to his youth and relative inexperience. In 2001 this rating was claimed by the George W. Bush administration as evidence of liberal bias in the ABA in its announcement that it would no longer confer with the ABA in selecting judicial nominees. Among Judge Easterbrook's most prominent opinions are: * American Booksellers v. Hudnut (1986) * Kirchoff v. Flynn (1986)Kirchoff v. Flynn, 786 F.2d 320 (7th Cir. 1986) * In re Erickson (1987)In re Erickson, 815 F.2d 1090 (7th Cir. 1987) * In re Sinclair (1989)In re Sinclair, 870 F.2d 1340 (7th Cir. 1989) * United States v. Van Fossan (1990)United States v. Van Fossan, 899 F.2d 636 (7th Cir. 1990) * Miller v. South Bend (1990)Miller v. South Bend, 904 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (dissenting), reversed, 501 U.S. 560 (1991) * United States v. Marshall (1990)United States v. Marshall, 908 F.2d 1312 (7th Cir. 1990) (en banc), affirmed under the name Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453 (1991) * Gacy v. Welborn (1993) * ProCD v. Zeidenberg (1996) * Asher v. Baxter International Inc. (2004) * BMG Music v. Gonzalez (2005) * Hosty v. Carter (2005) * Doe v. Smith 429 F.3d 706 (7th Cir. 2005) As a young judge in one of his early opinions, Kirchoff v. Flynn, 786 F.2d 320 (CA7 1986), a lawsuit over an arrest for feeding pigeons in a park, Easterbrook used such language as \\"trundled to the squadrol\\" to describe an arrest; and states of the pigeon-feeder that she \\"will never be confused with the 30th Earl of Mar, whose hobby was kicking pigeons\\". He described a controversy over whether a police officer, or the plaintiff's own bird, had attacked the plaintiff as: \\"[Plaintiff] says that he was clobbered by a pair of handcuffs; [the officer] maintains that the [plaintiffs]' red macaw drew the blood when it landed on [plaintiff]'s head during the fracas and started pecking\\". In a footnote, he added \\"Predatory birds rarely attack large animals whose eyes they can see, 11 Harv.Med. School Health Letter 8 (Feb.1986), and perhaps William's eyes got distracted, to his macaw's glee.\\" This serves as an example of Easterbrook's sophisticated deftness with language and breadth of knowledge. This deftness sometimes, however, results in passages from his opinions that require dictionaries in order for a layman to understand, such as in Frantz v. U.S. Powerlifting Federation, 836 F.2d 1063 (7th Cir. 1987), where he wrote, \\"The absence of ineluctable answers does not imply the privilege to indulge an unexamined gestalt.\\" University of Chicago Law School Dean Saul Levmore stated that \\"Easterbrook is an important influence on legal education through his judicial opinions. Course after law school course has changed for the better as Judge Easterbrook‚Äôs opinions have made their way into the curriculum. So long as he decides cases, and decides them in a way that cuts to the heart of an issue with such skill and pressure, no area of law can be dull\\". Easterbrook had a reputation for being \\"hard-nosed and demanding\\" during oral argument. In Schlessinger v. Salimes (1996), for example, he characterized the lawsuit as \\"goofy\\" and the appellant's arguments as \\"nutty\\" before issuing an order to show cause why the appellant and lawyer should not be sanctioned for a frivolous appeal. His demeanor has won him enemies in the bar. In 1994 the Chicago Council of Lawyers published an \\"evaluation\\" of the Seventh Circuit that evaluated all the judges and the court's procedures in general, but notably focused extensively on only two: Easterbrook and then-chief judge Richard Posner. The evaluation of Easterbrook contained an unusual number of grievances; and the Council did not specify authorship, so the criticism is anonymous. In a section devoted to Easterbrook's judicial demeanor, the report claims he \\"has consistently displayed a temperament that is improper for a Circuit Judge. While Judge Easterbrook has many good qualities, there is a widespread belief that he is arrogant and intolerant with those who do not match his own intellectual level. This problem seriously interferes with the performance of his duties\\". The report continued to state Easterbrook \\"has been resoundingly and repeatedly criticized as being extremely rude to attorneys at oral argument\\" and that \\"some attorneys\\" said that due to the judge's demeanor they and their clients did not feel they got a fair hearing. The Council pointed to another opinion, Kale v. Obuchowski, which derided a lawyer's argument as \\"pettifoggery\\" and concluded that the appeal was \\"frivolous, doomed and sanctionable\\".Kale v. Obuchowski, 985 F.2d 360 (7th Cir. 1993) The Council argued that even if the lawyer's conduct was sanctionable, \\"the language chosen does not enhance the administration of justice\\". However, this review by the Council was never repeated, lending partial support to the defenders of Easterbrook and Posner that the report was an opportunity for anonymous venting by lawyers who were unhappy with the results of Seventh Circuit decisions, in no small part thanks to the decisions of Reagan appointees Easterbrook and Posner. Posner has recently commented about the report, \\"You have here some anonymous people who are talking to the Chicago Council of Lawyers. How much credence should we put on these people? They can be sore losers. They can be crybabies.\\"Judge Posner Profiled in Columbia Journalism Review, law.uchicago.edu; accessed September 2, 2020. Easterbrook served as Chief Judge of the Seventh Circuit from 2006 to 2013. He is a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States and head of the Judicial Council for the Seventh Circuit. Influences Easterbrook called Learned Hand and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. his \\"judicial heroes\\".Life and Career of Frank Easterbrook, c-spanvideo.org; accessed April 24, 2015. Notable cases In December 2017, Easterbrook supported the 4‚Äì3 en banc decision to reverse an earlier federal magistrate judgment that a confession had been unlawfully coerced from 16-year-old Brendan Dassey. On November 1, 2019, Easterbrook concurred in the denial of rehearing regarding an Indiana abortion law requiring parental notifications. A 3-judge panel had struck down the injunctions. Easterbrook, and Diane S. Sykes who joined him, were the deciding votes to deny en banc. Easterbrook in his concurrence called on the Supreme Court to hear the case, and also pointed out its parallels with June Medical Services v. Gee. https://apnews.com/e6de8db5267445bb8473b808fd24a9af On January 23, 2020, Easterbrook wrote a decision slamming the Justice Department for arguing that a previous decision by the Seventh Circuit in the same immigration case was wrongly decided and that the Board of Immigration Appeals could ignore the decision. Easterbrook wrote, \\"The Board [of Immigration Appeals] seemed to think that we had issued an advisory opinion, and that faced with a conflict between our views and those of the Attorney General it should follow the latter. Yet it should not be necessary to remind the Board, all of whose members are lawyers, that the 'judicial Power' under Article III of the Constitution is one to make conclusive decisions, not subject to disapproval or revision by another branch of government.\\" The Court reversed the Board's decision and entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Jorge Baez-Sanchez v. Barr. https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/judge- easterbrook-goes-ballistic-on-immigration-judges-ignoring-express-order/ On June 29, 2020, Easterbrook wrote the opinion to reinstate significant voting restrictions in Wisconsin, originally put into place when Republicans controlled all branches of state government early in the previous decade and which U.S. District Judge James Peterson had overturned on constitutional grounds in July 2016. Easterbrook wrote that the even though the voting restrictions are discriminatory, it was purely based upon party affiliation (the areas most impacted are heavily Democratic leaning). His conclusion that this is acceptable relies on a 2019 US Supreme Court ruling that partisan manipulation of electoral districts was also acceptable. ‚ÄúThe changes were made because of politics,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThis record does not support a conclusion that the legislators who voted for the contested statutes cared about race; they cared about voters‚Äô political preferences.‚Äù He added that Democratic lawmakers could retake control of the legislature and change the laws they objected to. Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, observed ‚ÄúThis is an amazing conclusion that opens the doors to all kinds of partisan manipulation of election practices. It completely ignores the possibility that the party in charge might be able to alter the rules to keep itself in power, thus removing the ability of the opposing party to change the laws in the other direction.‚Äù The case was argued in 2017 and it was long a mystery why the court hadn't issued its ruling long before. Easterbrook's written opinion offered no explanation for the delay in delivering it until preparations for the 2020 national election cycle were just beginning, during the covid-19 pandemic and in the most closely contested \\"battleground state\\" of the 2016 national election cycle. Academic work Easterbrook's academic work focuses on corporate law, particularly the 1991 book The Economic Structure of Corporate Law, which he coauthored with Daniel Fischel. Easterbrook's article, \\"The Proper Role of a Target's Management in Responding to a Tender Offer\\", 94 Harv. L. Rev. 1161 (1981) (also coauthored with Fischel) is the most heavily cited corporate law article in legal scholarship. Easterbrook has also written articles on antitrust law and judicial interpretation, including Abstraction and Authority, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 349 (1992); Statutes' Domains, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 533 (1983); and Textualism and the Dead Hand, 66 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1119 (1998). See also * George W.

He discovered the Gilman reagent, which bears his name. Early life and education (1893-1918) Henry Gilman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, as the son of a tailor. He was the third of eight children. Gilman graduated from a Boston high school and later attended Harvard University where he graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1915. During his final year as an undergraduate at Harvard, Gilman researched with Roger Adams. During this time, the two worked on the synthesis of substituted phenyl esters of oxalic acids. Gilman worked hard on his research describing it as 'a sheer delight' and often worked until midnight 'without any compulsion-just for the joy of it' and claimed this was an important step toward his interest in research. After undergraduate work Gilman was invited to stay for graduate work with the head of the Harvard department of chemistry, E.P. Kohler. Based on his work, he received a Master of Arts degree in 1917(a year late) and a Ph.D. in 1918. While attending graduate school, Gilman had an opportunity to travel in Europe as a recipient of the Sheldon Fellowship. He spent time at both the Polytechnicum in Zurich and at Oxford in England. During his time in Europe, Gilman met Madame Curie at the Sorbonne, the historic University of Paris. While staying in Paris, Gilman met Victor Grignard and was intrigued by the advances in organic chemistry in France made possible by Grignard reagents. Once he was able to research independently, Gilman was determined to explore the chemistry of these organometallic reagents. Career For a short time after receiving his Ph.D., Henry Gilman worked an associate professor at the University of Illinois after being invited by his former instructor Roger Adams. In 1919, Gilman moved on to become an assistant professor in charge of organic chemistry at Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now Iowa State University). At the age of 30, Gilman was given the title of full professor. While at Iowa State College, Gilman met Ruth V. Shaw, a student of his first-year organic chemistry class, and the two were married in 1929. Gilman switched to the Episcopal church from the Jewish faith upon marriage. Gilman had high expectations for his graduate students, and it often took them more than twice as long as the norm to earn their degrees. They were expected to work in the research lab well into the night and on weekends. Gilman was known for frequently visiting the lab during the day and questioning each student as to what they had accomplished since his last visit. He would also go on business trips and not inform his secretary or students on when he would come back in an effort to discourage skipping. Gilman had another common practice for his graduate students. He would not assign a research project for his graduate students, but he would push students to produce a series of preparations. Students would write short publications that would spark ideas about additional experiments to perform, drawing all the material together to form a central thesis. During his career, Gilman consulted for many companies such as Quaker Oats and DuPont, although he continued as a professor at Iowa State University, as it came to be known. At the usual retirement age of 70, at that time, Gilman chose not to retire from Iowa State University and remained active in research until 1975 when he was 82 years old. World War II brought new opportunities for Gilman to do research for the government. He took part in the Manhattan Project, which was the code name for the government‚Äôs work on the atom bomb. Gilman concentrated on preparing volatile uranium derivatives, mainly dealing with alkoxides, and the syntheses of species with potential anti-malarial activities. Later years (1947-1986) In 1947, due to a combination of glaucoma and detachment of a retina Henry Gilman became blind in one eye and lost most of his vision in the other. He was forced to rely on his wife and students to act as his eyes, to read and write for him. His wife was almost always at his side to guide him in unfamiliar places and inform him of the people around him. Remarkably, he continued much of his work and never let his loss of sight hinder his skills. It could be argued that the majority of Gilman‚Äôs work was done after 1947. In 1973, the current chemistry building at Iowa State University was renamed Henry Gilman Hall. Gilman suffered from heart problems late in his life and was fitted with a pace-maker at the age of 88. He died in Ames, IA at the age of 93 and was followed by his wife less than two months later and she was followed by their daughter Jane six months later. They are survived by a son and four grandchildren. Works During his lifetime, Gilman completed 1020 papers, 584 of which were published after he became blind in 1947. In 1936, the Journal of Organic Chemistry was created by Gilman with the help of M.S. Kharasch. In 1938, he published a two-volume textbook titled Organic Chemistry: An Advanced Treatise, the first major organic chemistry textbook, with each chapter being contributed by leading leaders in the U.S. Subsequent additions were published in 1943 and another two editions in 1953. Gilman reagents are named after him Tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silane is one of many organosilicon compounds first reported by Gilman et al.

It is south of Terenure, east of Templeogue, and is in the postal districts of Dublin 14 and 16. It is within the administrative areas of both D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council. Location The broad area of Rathfarnham includes Whitechurch, Nutgrove, Ballyboden and Ballyroan. Historical sites in the Rathfarnham townlands include: Scholarstown, Kilmashogue, Mount Venus, Tibradden and Taylors Grange. History=Early and medieval history The name Rathfarnham (Fearnain's Ringfort) suggests an earlier habitation, but no remains of prehistoric fortifications, burial places, early churches or old records have been found. The written history of Rathfarnham begins after the Norman invasion of Ireland. Terenurr and Kimmage (Cheming), both described as being in Rathfranham (sic) parish Dublin, are mentioned in an 1175 grant by Henry II to Walter the goldsmith ('Aurifaber') held at Canterbury Cathedral Archives.Grant CCA-DCc-ChAnt/C/1206 nd [MayxNov 1175] In 1199 these lands were granted to Milo le Bret. In 1199 he adapted an existing ridge to build a motte and bailey fort at what is now the start of the Braemor Road. It was apparently still in evidence up to the early 20th century. In the following century no events of great importance are recorded as Rathfarnham, perhaps as it was protected on its south side by the Royal Forest of Glencree. Rathfarnham became more exposed to attack when this deer park was overrun by the Clan O'Toole from the Wicklow Mountains in the 14th century. Rathfarnham Castle was erected in part to protect the area from such attacks. Rathfarnham CastleIn addition, part of the Pale's defences ran through the townland of Rathfarnham. Some traces of this are still extant. From the 16th century The castle and much of the land around Rathfarnham belonged to the Eustace family of Baltinglass. However, their property was confiscated for their part in the Second Desmond Rebellion of 1579-83. The castle and its lands were then granted to the Loftus family. In the 1640s, the Loftus family was at the centre of the Irish Confederate Wars arising out of the Irish Rebellion of 1641. In 1649, the castle was seized by the Earl of Ormonde's Catholic and Royalist forces before the battle of Rathmines. However they were granted it back by the English parliamentarians after their victory in that battle. Reputedly, Oliver Cromwell stayed in Rathfarnham Castle on his way south to the Siege of Wexford. Economic activity in Rathfarnham was stepped up in the 17th century and in the early 18th century many gentlemen's residences were erected. Two key examples were Rathfarnham Castle and Ashfield. =Rathfarnham Castle= Rathfarnham Castle itself was re-modelled from a defensive stronghold into a stately home. Lower Dodder Road is still marked by a triumphal arch, from this era, which originally led to the castle. Ely's Arch The erection of this gateway is attributed to Henry Loftus, Earl of Ely from 1769 to 1783 who was also responsible for the classical work on the castle itself. The arch is named the \\"new gate\\" on Frizell's map of 1779. After the division of the estate in 1913 the arch became the entrance to the Castle Golf Club but was later abandoned in favour of the more direct Woodside Drive entrance. The area around the arch is a haven for wildlife, with the nearby River Dodder home to brown trout, otter and many water-birds including kingfisher, dipper and grey heron. Woodside Estate is home to red fox, rabbits and grey squirrels. =Ashfield= Ashfield, the next house on the same side, was occupied during the 18th century by Protestant clergy. In the early part of the 19th century it became the home of Sir William Cusac Smith, Baron of the Exchequer and from 1841 of the Tottenham family who continued in residence until 1913. After this the Brooks of Brooks Thomas Ltd. occupied it until about twenty years ago when the estate was divided up and houses built along the main road. A new road was later built along the side of the house and named Brookvale after the last occupants. Industrial revolution An industrial revolution, especially in the production of paper, began on the Owendoher and Dodder rivers and many mills were erected. In the beginning of the 19th century most of them switched to cotton and wool and later were converted to flour mills. The introduction of steam engines marked the end of this era and replaced the need for mills. Many of the old buildings fell into disrepair and were demolished, and their millraces filled in. A millpond and extensive mill buildings formerly occupied the low-lying fields on the west side of the main Rathfarnham road, just beside the bridge. On a map by Frizell dated 1779 it is called the \\"Widow Clifford's mill and mill holding\\" and in 1843 it is named the \\"Ely Cloth Factory\\". A Mr. Murray then owned it but in 1850, it passed into the hands of Mr. Nickson who converted it into a flour mill. His family continued in occupation until 1875 when John Lennox took over. In 1880 this mill closed down, the buildings were demolished and not a trace now remains. Historical featuresMilitary Road= The Military Road at the Sally Gap Rathfarnham is the start of the Military Road. This road through the Wicklow Mountains (still in use mainly for tourist traffic) was built at the beginning of the 19th century to open up the Wicklow Mountains to the British Army to assist them in putting down the insurgents who were hiding there following the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Rathfarnham itself was the scene of some skirmishes in the early days of the Rising which extended to the final battle in \\"Raheen\\" (now Raheen City) in County Wexford. Construction commenced on 12 August 1800 and was completed in October 1809. The road starts outside the Yellow House, passes the head of Glencree, with a spur down that valley to Enniskerry, rises to the Sally Gap and then dips down to Laragh, over the hills into Glenmalure, and finishes at Aghavannagh. Well known sections also include the Featherbed Mountain, the section below Kippure Mountain. The total distance was 34 Irish Miles, of which the spur to Enniskerry was 5 Irish Miles. The engineer in charge was Alexander Taylor (born in 1746), who was responsible for many other roads in the country, including some \\"Turnpike Roads\\", which are Toll Roads. =Rathfarnham Road= According to many writers the road to Rathfarnham follows the same route as the Sl√≠ghe Chualann, the ancient highway, which in the time of Saint Patrick was used by travellers between Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford. This road is believed to have crossed the Dodder at the Big Bridge, now Pearse Bridge, and re-crossed it again near Oldbawn, an unnecessarily inconvenient route, considering that a road through Templeogue to Oldbawn would not necessitate any crossing. The first record of a bridge being built here was in 1381 and in 1652 it was described by Gerard Boate in his A Natural History of Ireland as a wooden bridge which 'though it be high and strong nevertheless hath several times been quite broke and carried away through the violence of sudden floods.' After three bridges had been demolished by the river, between 1728 and 1765, the present structure of a single stone arch was erected in the latter year. This was widened on the west side in 1953 when it was renamed in commemoration of Patrick and William Pearse. In 1912 during the construction of a main drainage scheme to Rathfarnham, a stone causeway was uncovered below the road level. It was wide and built of great blocks crossing the course of the river. Cut into the surface of the stone were a number of deep parallel grooves, as from the action of wheeled traffic over a long period. This was evidence for the existence here of a busy thoroughfare even before the construction of the earliest bridge. =Old graveyard= Next to Ashfield is the old graveyard containing the ruins of a church that was dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. This was a medieval church used for Protestant worship until 1795 when it was found to be too small for the congregation and a new one was erected a short way off. The end walls of the old church still stand, the west gable containing a bell turret and the east pierced by a chancel arch, the chancel itself having disappeared. The north wall is gone and all that remains of the south wall is an arched opening. Near the entrance to the burial ground is the grave of Captain James Kelly, an old Fenian who was associated with the Fenian Rising of 1867. He was organiser for the Rathfarnham district and was known in the area as 'The Knight of Glendoo'. On one occasion when he was on the run he was hiding in the cellar of his business premises in Wicklow Street when police raided it. An employee named James Fitzpatrick who strongly resembled Capt. Kelly in appearance was arrested in error and was tried and sentenced to six months imprisonment, which he served without betraying his identity. Capt. Kelly died on 8 March 1915, aged 70. On the opposite side of the road is Crannagh Park and Road, Rathfarnham Park and Ballytore Road, all built on part of the old Rathfarnham Estate. In the garden of a house formerly named Tower Court in Crannagh Road is an ancient circular pigeon house, a relic of Lord Ely's occupation of Rathfarnham Castle. The entrance to this curious structure is by a low door on level with the ground and the inside is lined from floor to roof with holes for the pigeons. A later floor was inserted half way up, so as to make two rooms, and a second door broken through the wall at that level. =Rathfarnham Village= Grange Golf Club in the early 20th century In the castle grounds were several fish ponds which were supplied by a mill race taken from the stream which rises up at Kilmashogue and flows down through Grange Golf Club and Saint Enda's Park. This served several mills before entering the fish ponds, whence it ran through the golf links while a smaller branch was conducted under the road to the flour mills which stood at the corner of Butterfield Lane, on the site later occupied by Borgward Hansa Motors Ltd. Described in 1836 as Sweetman's Flour Mills, it frequently changed hands before closing down in 1887. It was later operated as a saw mill. The dry mill race can still be seen here on the north side of Butterfield Avenue. Rathfarnham Protestant Parish Church on the Main St was built in 1795 to replace the church in the old graveyard. Beside the church is the old school house that dates from early in the nineteenth century. Immediately adjoining is Church Lane at the corner of which is a bank built on the site of a Royal Irish Constabulary barracks that was burned down by Anti-Treaty IRA forces in September 1922 during the Irish Civil War. In the lane is an old blocked up doorway of an early eighteenth century type. Church Lane leads to Woodview cottages, which are built partly on the site of an old paper mill. The mill race previously mentioned passed under Butterfield Lane to the paper mill and continued on below Ashfield to turn the wheel of the Ely Cloth Factory. It was later turned into the Owen Doher River at Woodview Cottages. Until recently, when the new road was made to Templeogue, the old mill race could still be traced through the grounds of Ashfield where its dry bed was still spanned by several stone bridges. The paper mill, of which some old walls and brick arches still survive, has been described as the oldest in Ireland but there does not appear to be any evidence to support this. The earliest reference to a paper mill here is 1719 when William Lake of Rathfarnham presented a petition for financial aid but we hear of one at Milltown as far back as 1694. In 1751 William and Thomas Slater whose works were destroyed by fire in 1775 made paper here. Archer's survey of 1801 mentions two paper mills here, Freemans and Teelings, and both Dalton in 1836 and Lewis in 1837 state that one paper mill was still working and from 1836 to 1839 the name Henry Hayes, Rathfarnham Mill appears in the directories. If this can be identified with the mill at Woodview cottages it must have become idle soon afterwards as it is designated \\"Old Mill\\" on the 1843 edition of the O.S. map. In 1854 when this mill had neither water wheel nor machinery an attempt was made to re-open it for the manufacture of paper but it came to nothing. The mill race has now been completely removed to make way for a housing development. At the end of the main street, on the right, the road to Lower Rathfarnham passes the site of the earliest Constabulary barracks. This closed down in 1890 when the establishment was transferred to a house named Leighton Lodge near Loreto Abbey. =Rathfarnham Lower= The Catholic Church of the Annunciation was erected in 1878 to replace the old chapel in Willbrook Road. Outside the church door is a primitive type of font on a pedestal bearing the inscription FONT USED IN MASS HOUSE OF PENAL TIMES IN PARISH OF RATHFARNHAM FROM 1732. The appearance of this font would suggest that it was originally a stone bullaun dating back to a period much earlier than the penal times. On the opposite corner is the well-known Yellow House, a licensed premises built near the site of an inn of the same name which is marked on Taylor's map of 1816. (The Catholic Church of the Annunciation (see above) is on the site of the original Yellow House). A tradition has been recorded by Mr. Hammond that in 1798 a Michael Eades, who sheltered wanted men in his house, owned it. It was also frequented by the soldiers of the Rathfarnham Guard whose careless talk was carefully noted by the United Irishmen hiding on the premises. In 1804 when the truth came to be known, the same military wrecked the place. Following Wilbrook road down between the Yellow House and the Annunciation, a large set of wrought iron gates can be observed. These gates, which now act as the pedestrian entrance to the Beaufort Downs housing estate, were originally the entrance to the Beaufort estate of the 18th century. =Nutgrove Avenue= A short distance past the church is Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with Churchtown. The old quiet tree shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the narrow lanes, a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood at the entrance to this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription Nutgrove School Established 1802. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr. Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs. Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants becoming the parish council headquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with cement plaster, concealing the fact that this was a very interesting eighteenth century building containing a fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately the house fell into very bad repair and eventually was demolished. Weston St John Joyce, in his Neighbourhood of Dublin, states that this house was at one time the dower house of Rathfarnham Castle but in this he is almost certainly mistaken, as Frizell's map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house on the opposite side of the avenue which was formerly named Ely Cottage, later altered to Ely Lodge, and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently been restored. =Loreto Abbey= Loreto Abbey in Lower Rathfarnham form a landmark visible for a number of miles south of the city. It served as the headquarters of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Rathfarnham House The mansion which now forms the centrepiece of the group was built by Mr. William Palliser about 1725. No expense was spared in its construction and decoration, and its interior includes polished mahogany and, in one room, embossed leather wallpaper. William Palliser died in 1768 without issue and Rathfarnham House passed to his cousin the Rev. John Palliser, who was rector of the parish. George Grierson (Gilbert Stuart) After his death in 1795 the house was purchased by George Grierson, the King's Printer in Ireland, who resided here for a few years. When Grierson moved to his new abode in Woodtown in 1800 the house remained unoccupied until 1821, when it was purchased by the Most Rev. Dr Murray for the newly founded Loreto Order. The foundress Rev. Mother Mary Teresa Ball made a number of improvements to the place. She is said to have added a storey to the old house although there is no evidence from the exterior to support this. Many additions have been made over the years, the church was built in 1840, the novitiate in 1863 and six years later St Joseph's wing which contains the concert hall and refectory. St Anthony's wing was erected in 1896, St Francis Xavier's in 1903 and the Lisieux building in 1932 for the accommodation of visiting prelates to the Eucharistic Congress. In the 1920s, novice Agnes Bojaxhiu (later to become Mother Teresa) came to Loreto Abbey to learn English. This was the language the Sisters of Loreto used to teach school children in India. Beaufort House Directly across the road from the Abbey is Beaufort House, which is now the headquarters of the Loreto Order in Ireland. This house was occupied by Robert Hodgens J.P. (1793‚Äì1860) and then by his sons, John Conlan Hodgens and Henry Hodgens.Lewis's Topographical Dictionary, 1837 On the grounds is Loreto High School Beaufort which was founded in 1925. =The Ponds= Loreto Terrace on the north side of the Abbey was formerly known as 'The Ponds', a name originating apparently from the large pond which two hundred years ago occupied the low lying field between Loreto Terrace and Nutgrove Avenue. This area was described in Weston St John Joyce's The Neighbourhood of Dublin in 1912 as \\"the dilapidated locality known as the Ponds\\" but it has since been largely rebuilt. An old photograph from Larry O'Connor's collection shows what it looked like at that time. The last of the old houses was demolished in the mid-1980s. It was a very early 18th century gabled residence named Grove Cottage. This place was the scene of a skirmish at the outbreak of the rising of 1798. The insurgents of the south county assembled at the Ponds on 24 May 1798 under the leadership of David Keely, James Byrne, Edward Keogh and Ledwich. The latter two had been members of Lord Ely's yeomanry but had taken to the field with the United Irishmen. The insurgents were attacked by the local yeomanry corps but were able to defend themselves and the yeomanry was forced to retreat. A party of regular troops was then sent against them and a stiff encounter took place. A number of the insurgents were killed or wounded and some prisoners taken including Keogh and Ledwich. The survivors retreated, joining up with a party from Clondalkin, and a further engagement took place at the turnpike on the Rathcoole road where the enemy was successfully repulsed. =Harold's Grange and Taylors Grange= The road to Harold's Grange continues southward from Loreto Abbey. The first site is Snugborough, which has its gable end to the road. The next is Washington Lodge, its 18th century facade hidden by a shrubbery. In later years new avenues have been laid out here on both sides of the road. Barton Drive, on the left, occupies the site of a house named Barton Lodge (occupied by William Conlan, a brewer in Dublin, until his death in 1829 - his daughter married into the local Hodgens family, who in the 1870s donated the lands for the Church of the Annunciation). On the other side is Silveracre, once the home of Dr Henthorn Todd, Professor of Hebrew in Trinity College, who was connected by marriage to the Hudson family of the adjoining Hermitage estate. He died here in 1869. About the middle of the last century the name of the house was changed to Silverton but it was later reverted to the original Silveracre. Most of the land is now built on. It was also the home in the early part of twentieth century of Surgeon Croly, who founded Baggot St Hospital. =St Enda's= The Hermitage, site of St Enda's The next estate on the same side is Hermitage or Saint Enda's, the former home of Patrick Pearse and later of his sister Margaret Mary Pearse. The house, which is entirely faced with cut granite and has an imposing stone portico, was occupied in the eighteenth century by Edward Hudson, an eminent dentist. He had a passion for Irish antiquities, which he demonstrated in an unusual way by the erection of a number of romantic ruins around the estate. He built a small watch tower inside the boundary wall near the entrance gate and further along, a hermit's cave, a dolmen, a ruined abbey and beside a deep well, a tiny chamber with a stone bench and a narrow fireplace. At the corner of the road to Whitechurch the loopholed and crenulated structure, known as the \\"Fortification\\" or \\"Emmet's Fort\\" was another of his creations. South of the house he built a grotto surmounted by a tall stone pillar, a Brehon's Chair and a fanciful construction consisting of two great boulders, one balanced on top of the other, which has since been demolished. Just inside the boundary wall he cut an inscription in Ogham on the two faces of a large rock. Translated they read: RIDENT VICINI GLEBASETS A KH A MOVENTEM EDUARDUM HUDSON. In the pretty glen adjoining the Whitechurch road he erected a sort of temple with several small chambers and flights of steps. The estate was at that time known as the \\"Fields of Oden\\" and is so called on maps of the period. Within the grounds also, at the corner nearest to Whitechurch is an obelisk, stated to have been erected by a former owner, Major Doyne, over the grave of a horse that carried him through the Battle of Waterloo. The date however of Major Doyne's occupation does not support this. Meanwhile, P√°draig Pearse wrote in An Macaomh that \\"a monument in the wood, beyond the little lake, is said to mark the spot where a horse of Sarah Curran's was killed and is buried.\\"http://pearsemuseum.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/An-Macaomh- Christmas-1910.compressed.pdf Unlike the constructions of Edward Hudson, which were purposely of the roughest material, this monument was of cut stone with small moulded pillars. After having been vandalized and toppled, it has since been re-erected without the pillars which were broken. Edward Hudson was succeeded by his son William Elliot Hudson, who was born here in 1796. A distinguished scholar, he was a friend of Thomas Davis and Charles Gavan Duffy and was a patron of Irish literature and art. Shortly before his death in 1857 he endowed the Royal Irish Academy with a fund for the publication of its Irish Dictionary and he also left the Academy Library a valuable collection of books. From 1840 to 1858 Hermitage was the home of Richard Moore, Attorney General, and in 1859 it came into the possession of Major Richard Doyne, stated to be a veteran of the Waterloo. From 1872 to 1885 it was occupied by George Campbell, merchant of 58 Sackville St., and after lying vacant for a few years it was tenanted by Major Philip Doyne of the 4th Dragoon Guards. In 1891 Colonel Frederick le Mesurier, barrister is returned as occupier and in 1899 Mr. William Woodburn. St Enda's School was founded by Padraig Pearse in 1909 and was at first housed in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh. Pearse felt that the confined surroundings of this house gave no scope for the outdoor life that should play so large a part in the education of youth, so in 1910 he leased Hermitage from Mr. Woodburn and moved his college here. A long billiard room was converted into a study hall and chapel, the drawing room became a dormitory and the stables opening off an enclosed square became class rooms. In \\"The Story of a Success\\" Pearse tells of the realisation of one of his life's ambitions and it was from here that he set off for the city on his bicycle for the last time on Easter Sunday 1916. After the rising the college continued to function under the care of Margaret Pearse until it finally closed down in 1935. After the death of Margaret Pearse in 1968 St Enda's passed into the hands of the state and has since been opened as a public park and home of the Pearse Museum. =Priory= Directly opposite to St Enda's was Priory, the home of John Philpot Curran, at the time of Emmet's rising. The house was formerly named Holly Park but when Curran bought it in 1790 he changed the name to Priory. He lived here for 27 years at the peak of his fame and here he was to endure the tragic events, which cast a shadow on his private life. First the untimely death of his daughter Gertrude, followed by the loss of his wife, who left him for another man, and lastly the discovery of the association of his daughter Sarah Curran with Robert Emmet. Gertrude Curran died in 1792 at the age of 12 as the result of a fall from a window. Curran had her buried in the grounds of the Priory and over the grave he placed a recumbent slab, on which was fixed a metal plate bearing the inscription: :Here lies the body of Gertrude Curran :fourth daughter of John Philpot Curran :who departed this life October 6, 1792 :Age twelve years. The position of the grave was clearly marked on the early editions of the O.S. maps. It was about midway along the northern boundary of the corner field facing the fortification, on the north side of the boundary bank and a few yards from it. It was formerly enclosed by a grove of trees, which can be seen in J. J. Reynold's photograph of 1903 but these were cut down about 1928. Some time later the stumps were dug out and the stone slab broken up and thrown on the adjoining bank. The metal plate had already been taken by souvenir hunters. It was Sarah Curran's desire to be buried here also but to this her father would not agree as he had come in for criticism on the previous occasion for burying his daughter in unconsecrated ground. In this district nearly every ancient site is associated in tradition with either Sarah Curran or Robert Emmet and it is not surprising therefore to find that this burial place has been suggested as the last resting place of Robert Emmet. This tradition goes back for well over a century and it is rather surprising that this site was not investigated when the search for Emmet's remains was being made at places a great deal less accessible and no less improbable. In October 1979 the opportunity offered itself to carry out this investigation. The Hermitage estate was being developed and heavy machinery moved in to lay the roads and sewers. A Mrs. Bernadette Foley of nearby Barton Drive drew attention to the need to carry out this work before the site was buried forever under a concrete jungle. With the co-operation of Messrs Gallaghers, the developers, a small group undertook to investigate the site. First the exact location was checked on the original large scale manuscript map in the O.S., next the field was carefully chained and the site marked to within a few feet and then a narrow trench deep was dug through where the burial should have been. The result was a complete blank. A second and a third trench were cut at intervals until a large area had been investigated without finding any burial, timber, brick or stone. The developers then offered to investigate further with the excavator and carefully cleared an area of long and wide to a depth of without finding any sign of disturbance. They then deepened this area by another two feet with no better result. All the accounts of the burial state that it was made in a vault and it is therefore surprising and disappointing that no evidence whatever was found and there does not seem to be any obvious explanation for it. The builders, Messrs Gallaghers Ltd. were commended for their interest in this aspect of the site and their painstaking excavation work under the supervision of Mr. Leslie Black was expertly carried out. Priory was occupied by the Curran family until 1875 and subsequently by the Taylors until 1923. At the beginning of the century the house and gardens were still in good repair but after the Taylor's time the place was neglected. Twenty years ago the walls were still standing but little now remains but some heaps of rubble. =St Columba's College= St Columba's College is a privately run, Church of Ireland co-educational boarding school with c. 300 pupils. It was founded in 1843 by the then Primate of Ireland, Rev. William Sewell. In 1849 the college moved from Stackallan House in County Meath to its present site in Whitechurch, Rathfarnham. The headmaster of the college is addressed as 'warden' and the vice-principal as 'sub-warden'. The college school day is split up during the winter - school classes end at 13:00 and there are games and other outdoor activities after lunch from 14:00 - 15:30. Classes recommence at 16:15 and continue until 18:00. The school week consists of five days from Monday to Saturday with Wednesday and Saturday being half- days. The college has a very high academic profile but it also focusses a considerable attention on music, drama and art. The college caters for a wide range of academic abilities and provides an excellent special-needs service for children with mild learning deficits. The geographical layout of the college does not accommodate or facilitate wheelchairs. Features Rathfarnham is home to several notable historic buildings, including Rathfarnham Castle and Loreto Abbey, four parks: Marlay Park, Dodder Park, St Enda's and Bushy Park, and several pubs including The Eden, Buglers, Revels and the landmark Yellow House. Padraig Pearse established St Enda's School for Boys, which is now a museum in his honour situated in Saint Enda's Park. Amenities Rathfarnham has a number of shops and businesses, including two bank branches, notably in the Nutgrove Shopping Centre. The area's other shopping centre is the small Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. The area also has a Garda Station and two post offices, and is home to the city's main animal shelter. Marlay Park is a large open parkland, with a craft centre near the old \\"big house\\"; the park hosts concerts every year. Aside from St Enda's, Dodder Park and Bushy Park (see above), Loreto park and small green spaces, the area also hosts two golf clubs. Education There are five schools in Rathfarnham: St Marys BNS, Loreto High School, Loreto Primary, C√≥loaiste Pearce and Educate Together Rathfarnham. Organisations and sport Signage for the 2016 Rathfarnham 5 km Run, organised by Rathfarnham WSAF Athletic Club Rathfarnham is home to the 13th Dublin, the 14th Dublin, the 31st Dublin (which was founded in 1917) and the 68th Dublin Scout troops and the Rathfarnham Girl Guides The area is also home to the Rathfarnham Concert Band. For Gaelic games, there is the Ballinteer St John's GAA Club, and also Ballyboden St. Enda's GAA which is one of the largest GAA clubs in Ireland. Rathfarnham has a number of soccer teams including Nutgrove Celtic, Rathfarnham Punters, Rathfarnham Rovers, Leicester Celtic, Broadford Rovers and Whitechurch United. Rathfarnham is also home to a number of boxing clubs and to Rathfarnham WSAF Athletics Club. Demographics According to the 2006 Census,Census 2006 Populations of Electoral Divisions, 2002 - 2006 Rathfarnham has a population of 17,333 ‚Äì a drop of 2.1% since 2002. The population has gradually decreased over the years from 17,760 in 1996 to 17,717 in 2002. The number of people living around the neighbourhoods of Ballyroan and St Endas fell by 8% and 7% respectively. On the other hand, there were minimal increases in the Butterfield and Hermitage areas. The statistics indicate that Rathfarnham is aging, with young couples that moved into the area in the 1960s entering retirement. Due to the suggestion that there weren't many suitable sites in the area for apartment building, analysts for the Rathfarnham Community Website, predicted that Census 2010 would show further decreases. Culture and entertainment=Music Between May and August every year, concerts are held in Marlay Park. Acts to play the venue in 2007 included Damien Rice, Foo Fighters, Kaiser Chiefs, Crowded House, Aerosmith, Damien Rice, The Who and Peter Gabriel. Muse, The Killers, Lenny Kravitz/Alanis Morissette played in the park during 2008 Metallica, Fatboy Slim, Dizzee Rascal and Calvin Harris played there in August 2009. Marley Park has also hosted the Longitude Festival every July since 2013. Film location A number of films have shot some of their scenes in Rathfarnham. The opening scene in Intermission was recorded at Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. In one scene in the movie Ordinary Decent Criminal, a car is blown up in front of the Pearse Museum in St Enda's Park. The Secret Scripture was filmed in Loreto Abbey, Rathfarnham in 2015. Pubs The Yellow House, Rathfarnham Pubs in the area include \\"Buglers\\" pub in Ballyboden House on the Ballyboden Road in Ballyboden. John Blake was the first known publican to be granted the licence in 1799. On Rathfarnham's main street, near Rathfarnham Castle, is \\"The Castle Inn\\". \\"The Eden House\\" pub is on Grange Road near Marlay Park. The building was formerly \\"Eden House\\", one of the 18th century stately houses on Grange Road, before being converted to its present use. The pub was then sold in 2006 for ‚Ç¨5.5m, renovated, and is now run by owners of The Morgue Pub in Templeogue Village. \\"The Old Orchard\\" is on Butterfield Avenue near Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. \\"The Blue Haven\\" is situated on the junction of Ballyroan Road and Butterfield Avenue. \\"The Yellow House\\", is at the corner of Willbrook Road and Grange Road, a short distance from Rathfarnham Castle. It is believed that the first pub bearing the name was a thatched cottage standing on the site of the present Catholic church, and that the licence went back as far as the early eighteenth century. A new Yellow House was built in 1825 and opened for business in 1827. The current building dates from 1885.NIAH It was refurbished and extended in 1979. According to local folklore, the poet Francis Ledwidge worked there for two days as an apprentice before homesickness for his home town of Slane, County Meath, caused him to leave. Transport Rathfarnham is served by the Dublin Bus route numbers 16 (Ballinteer to Dublin Airport via Dublin city centre), 15B (Stocking Avenue to Grand Canal Dock via the city centre), 17 (to UCD), 61 (to Eden Quay), 75 (to Tallaght) and 161 (to Rockbrook). The 16 route was the first bus route in Dublin to have free Internet Wi-Fi onboard. In 2007, it was proposed that a Luas tram line (mention in a feasibility study as 'Line E') would be routed through Rathfarnham. However, it was found that the proposal would not be feasible, as road widening would be required, necessitating the compulsory purchase of a significant number of homes and gardens on the route. Because of this, the project was not progressed.

He spent most of his life in Venice. Biography Vincenzo Coronelli was born, probably in Venice, on August 16, 1650, the fifth child of a Venetian tailor named Maffio Coronelli. At ten, young Vincenzo was sent to the city of Ravenna and was apprenticed to a xylographer. In 1663 he was accepted into the Conventual Franciscans, becoming a novice in 1665. At age sixteen he published the first of his one hundred forty separate works. In 1671 he entered the Convent of Saint Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice, and in 1672 Coronelli was sent by the order to the College of Saint Bonaventura and Saints Apostoli in Rome where he earned his doctor‚Äôs degree in theology in 1674. He excelled in the study of both astronomy and Euclid. A little before 1678, Coronelli began working as a geographer and was commissioned to make a set of terrestrial and celestial globes for Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma. Each finely crafted globe was five feet in diameter (c. 175 cm) and so impressed the Duke that he made Coronelli his theologian.‚ÄúLe Hall des Globes: Exposition permanente des Globes de Coronelli √† la BnF,‚Äù press release, (Paris: Biblioth√®que nationale de France, 2006), 6-7.James Lawrence Fuchs, ‚ÄúVincenzo Coronelli and the Organization of Knowledge: The Twilight of Seventeenth-Century Encyclopedism‚Äù (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Chicago, 1983), 4-7.Ermano Armao, Vincenzo Coronelli, Cenni Sull‚Äôuomo e la Sua Vita (Firenze: Bibliopolis, 1944), 1-16ff. Coronelli's renown as a theologian grew and in 1699 he was appointed Father General of the Franciscan order. Later life Coronelli worked in various European countries in the following years, before permanently returning to Venice in 1705. Here he started his own cosmographical project and published the volumes of Atlante Veneto. In his home city he founded the very first geographical society, the Accademia Cosmografica degli Argonauti. He also held the position of Cosmographer of the Republic of Venice.Anastasia Stouraiti, \\"Propaganda figurata: geometrie di dominio e ideologie veneziane nelle carte di Vincenzo Coronelli\\", Studi veneziani 44 (2002), 129-155 Later six volumes of the Biblioteca Universale Sacro-Profana were published by Coronelli. This was a kind of encyclopedia, its compiled entries ordered alphabetically. Coronelli died at the age of 68 in Venice, having created hundreds of maps in his lifetime. The International Coronelli Society for the Study of Globes, founded 1952 in Vienna, is named in Coronelli's honor. Globes for Louis XIV The terrestrial globe Coronelli made for Louis XIV. The celestial globe Coronelli made for Louis XIV. Cardinal C√©sar d'Estr√©es, friend and adviser to Louis XIV and ambassador to Rome, saw the Duke of Parma‚Äôs globes and invited Coronelli to Paris in 1681 to construct a pair of globes for the Most Christian King. Coronelli moved to the French capital in 1681, where he lived for two years. Each globe was composed of spindles of bent timber about ten feet long and four inches broad at the equator. This wood was then coated with a layer of plaster about an inch thick and covered in a layer of strong unfinished fabric. This was then wrapped in a quarter-inch layer of two very fine fabrics which provided backing for the painted information of the globes.Monique Pelletier, ‚ÄúLes Globes de Louis XIV: les Sources fran√ßaises de l‚Äôoeuvre de Coronelli,‚Äù Imago Mundi 34 (1982): 78. These globes, measuring 384 cm in diameterThe diameter is of 487 cm with meridians and horizon circles. and weighing approximately 2 tons, are displayed in the Biblioth√®que nationale Fran√ßois Mitterrand in Paris.Monique Pelletier, ‚ÄúLes Globes de Louis XIV: les Sources fran√ßaises de l‚Äôoeuvre de Coronelli,‚Äù Imago Mundi 34 (1982): 78. The globes depicted the latest information of French explorations in North America, particularly the expeditions of Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. The Bergamo Globes The request for \\"Globes\\" started as private princely commissions from a highly discriminating class, mostly concentrated in the courts of Northern and Central Europe. The art of coated cards globes, terrestrial or celestial, handwritten and often finely decorated, originated in Italy. Coronelli was among the initiators of this art. The most famous Coronelli globes are divided into 2 groups: the first includes the Globes manufactured for the Duke of Parma and Louis XIV, which are unique for their extraordinary quality; the second one includes those built since 1688, as result of the fame of the first. Indeed, the quality of globes made for Louis XIV created the \\"request\\" for other Coronelli's globes. Their reputation was so wide that they inspired requests from the highest classes and institutions, desiring to adorn their libraries with these elements not only for scientific use but also as artistic ornaments. It is to this intent the two globes that we admire today in the Salone Furietti of Angelo Mai Library arrived in Bergamo. The history of the two globes is closely tied to cultural events and policies that have affected the city of Bergamo in the last 500 years. The two Coronelli globes came to Bergamo in 1692, when Angelo Finardi, man of letters and Augustinian friar was librarian at the Augustinian monastery. He commissioned ta man to buy them in Venice just with the intent of equipping the monastery library with essential tools of culture. In 1797, the monastery was suppressed. Both the globes met with the confiscations of Napoleonic laws and were on the way to Paris, gathered along with the Versailles globes. Nevertheless, thanks are owed to the noble Giovanni Battista Vertova, who hid the two globes in his home in 1834, and to his son Andrea, by whom they were donated to the Bergamo Library.

Bush administration officials with raw intelligence (unvetted by intelligence analysts, see Stovepiping) pertaining to Iraq.Alexandrovna, Larisa. \\"Senate Intelligence Committee Stalling Prewar Intelligence,\\" The Raw Story, December 2, 2005. Retrieved May 22, 2007. A similar unit, called the Iranian Directorate, was created several years later, in 2006, to deal with intelligence on Iran. Allegations of manipulation of intelligence In an interview with the Scottish Sunday Herald, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer Larry C. Johnson said the OSP was \\"dangerous for US national security and a threat to world peace. [The OSP] lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam. It's a group of ideologues with pre-determined notions of truth and reality. They take bits of intelligence to support their agenda and ignore anything contrary. They should be eliminated.\\"Mackay, Neil (June 8, 2003), Sunday Herald. (Also about the British Operation Rockingham.) Seymour Hersh writes that, according to an unnamed Pentagon adviser, \\"[OSP] was created in order to find evidence of what Wolfowitz and his boss, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, wanted to be true‚Äîthat Saddam Hussein had close ties to Al Qaeda, and that Iraq had an enormous arsenal of chemical, biological, and possibly even nuclear weapons (WMD) that threatened the region and, potentially, the United States. [...] 'The agency [CIA] was out to disprove linkage between Iraq and terrorism,' the Pentagon adviser told me. 'That's what drove them. If you've ever worked with intelligence data, you can see the ingrained views at C.I.A. that color the way it sees data.' The goal of Special Plans, he said, was 'to put the data under the microscope to reveal what the intelligence community can't see.'\\"Hersh, Seymour M. (May 5, 2003). Selective Intelligence, New Yorker. These allegations are supported by an annex to the first part of Senate Intelligence Committee's Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq published in July 2004. The review, which was highly critical of the CIA's Iraq intelligence generally but found its judgments were right on the lack of an Iraq-al Qaeda relationship, suggests that the OSP, if connected to an \\"Iraqi intelligence cell\\" also headed by Douglas Feith which is described in the annex, sought to discredit and cast doubt on CIA analysis in an effort to establish a connection between Saddam Hussein and terrorism. In one instance, in response to a cautious CIA report, Iraq and al-Qa'eda: A Murky Relationship, the annex relates that \\"one of the individuals working for the [intelligence cell led by Feith] stated that the June [2002] report, '...should be read for content only ‚Äì and CIA's interpretation ought to be ignored.'\\"Report on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq. (July 9, 2004). United States Select Senate Committee on Intelligence. Douglas Feith called the office's report a much-needed critique of the CIA's intelligence. \\"It's healthy to criticize the CIA's intelligence\\", Feith said. \\"What the people in the Pentagon were doing was right. It was good government.\\" Feith also rejected accusations he attempted to link Iraq to a formal relationship with Al Qaeda. \\"No one in my office ever claimed there was an operational relationship\\", Feith said. \\"There was a relationship.\\"Feller, Ben, \\"Ex-Pentagon Official Defends Iraq Stance\\", Associated Press, February 11, 2007. In another instance, an \\"Iraqi intelligence cell\\" briefing to Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz in August 2002 condemned the CIA's intelligence assessment techniques and denounced the CIA's \\"consistent underestimation\\" of matters dealing with the alleged Iraq‚ÄìAl-Qaeda co-operation. In September 2002, two days before the CIA's final assessment of the Iraq-al Qaeda relationship, Feith briefed senior advisers to Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice, undercutting the CIA's credibility and alleging \\"fundamental problems\\" with CIA intelligence-gathering. As reported in the conservative British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, \\"Senator Jay Rockefeller, senior Democrat on the [Senate] committee, said that Mr Feith's cell may even have undertaken 'unlawful' intelligence-gathering initiatives.\\"Coman, Julian (July 11, 2004). Fury over Pentagon cell that briefed White House on Iraq's 'imaginary' al- Qaeda links, The Telegraph In February 2007, the Pentagon's inspector general issued a report that concluded that Feith's office \\"developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al Qaida relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers.\\" The report found that these actions were \\"inappropriate\\" though not \\"illegal.\\" Senator Carl Levin, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated that \\"The bottom line is that intelligence relating to the Iraq‚Äìal-Qaeda relationship was manipulated by high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense to support the administration's decision to invade Iraq. The inspector general's report is a devastating condemnation of inappropriate activities in the DOD policy office that helped take this nation to war.\\" At Senator Levin's insistence, on April 6, 2007, the Pentagon's Inspector General's Report was declassified and released to the public. Feith stated that he \\"felt vindicated\\" by the report. He told the Washington Post that his office produced \\"a criticism of the consensus of the intelligence community, and in presenting it I was not endorsing its substance.\\" Feith also said the inspector general's report amounted to circular logic: \\"The people in my office were doing a criticism of the intelligence community consensus\\", Feith said. \\"By definition, that criticism varied. If it didn't vary, they wouldn't have done the criticism.\\"Feller, Ben, \\"Ex-Pentagon Official Defends Iraq Stance\\", Associated Press, February 11, 2007 Alleged unlawful activities Journalist Larisa Alexandrovna of The Raw Story reported in 2006 that the OSP \\"deployed several extra-legal and unapproved task force missions\\" in Iraq both before and after the beginning of combat. The teams operated independently of other operations, occasionally causing confusion on the battlefield. The teams appear to have had a political rather than military mission; specifically, to find Iraqi intelligence officers willing to come up with evidence of WMD in Iraq whether or not such weapons actually existed: > \\"They come in the summer of 2003, bringing in Iraqis, interviewing them\\", [a > source close to the UN Security Council] said. \\"Then they start talking > about WMD and they say to [these Iraqi intelligence officers] that 'Our > President is in trouble. He went to war saying there are WMD and there are > no WMD. What can we do? Can you help us?'\\" According to the United Nations source, the intelligence officers did not cooperate with the OSP forces because they were aware that forged WMD evidence \\"would not pass the smell test and could be shown to be not of Iraqi origin and not using Iraqi methodology.\\" Indictment for espionage Lawrence Franklin, an analyst and Iran expert in the Feith office, has been charged with espionage, as part of a larger FBI investigation (see Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal). The scandal involves passing information regarding United States policy towards Iran to Israel via the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Feith's role is also being investigated. According to The Guardian, Feith's office had an unconventional relationship with Israel's intelligence services: Allegations have also been made that Pentagon employees in the Feith office have been involved in plans for overthrowing the governments of Iran and Syria. When Former NSA Chief General Michael Hayden testified before the Senate Hearing on his nomination as Director of Central Intelligence in May 2006, he was questioned by Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) on the pressure exerted by the Office of Special Plans on the intelligence community over the question of Hussein's links to al-Qaeda. Hayden explained that he was not comfortable with the OSP's analysis: > I got three great kids, but if you tell me go out and find all the bad > things they've done, Hayden, I can build you a pretty good dossier, and > you'd think they were pretty bad people, because that was what I was looking > for and that's what I'd build up. That would be very wrong. That would be > inaccurate. That would be misleading. He also acknowledged that after \\"repeated inquiries from the Feith office\\" he put a disclaimer on NSA intelligence assessments of Iraq/al-Qaeda contacts.

Phormio led his men up slowly from the side of the city that the Athenians had not yet surrounded and constructed a counter-wall to complete Potidaea's investment.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.64-65 After Potidaea was firmly besieged, Phormio led his men in a successful campaign against Athens' enemies in the Chalcidice,Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.65 and in the next year he again led an army attacking the Chalcidians, this time alongside Perdiccas II, king of Macedon.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 2.29 Naupactus In the winter of 429/8 BC, Phormio was sent out to the Corinthian Gulf as commander of a fleet of 20 triremes; establishing his base at Naupactus, Phormio instituted a blockade of Corinthian shipping.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 2.69 In the summer of 429 BC, however, Sparta began preparing a sizeable fleet and army to attack Athens' allies in the region, hoping to overrun Acarnania on land, capture the islands of Zacynthus and Cephallenia, and possibly even take Naupactus.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 2.80 Phormio was notified of these plans by the concerned Acarnanians, but was initially unwilling to leave Naupactus unprotected.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 2.81 When the Peloponnesian fleet began moving along the south shore of the Corinthian gulf, however, aiming to cross over to Acarnania, the Athenians followed along the north shore and attacked them once they passed out of the Gulf into the open sea and attempted to cross from the south to the north.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 2.83 In the ensuing battle, Phormio utilized a unique and unorthodox tactic.Unless otherwise noted, all details of the battle are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 2.83-4. The Peloponnesians, despite their superior numbers (they had 47 ships to the Athenians' 20, although many of their vessels were loaded with heavy infantry) pulled their ships into a defensive circle, prows facing outwards. Phormio with his ships circled around the Peloponnesian fleet, driving the circle ever tighter. The tactic was a risky one‚Äîit left the Athenians' flanks utterly vulnerable to ramming‚Äîbut it paid off when a wind blew up and caused the inexperienced crews of the circled vessels to foul their oars.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 93 In this moment of confusion, the Athenians rushed in and routed the remaining ships of the fleet, seizing 12 of them. In a second battle shortly after this, Phormio and his small force triumphed against an even larger Peloponnesian fleet of 77 ships.Unless otherwise noted, all details of the battle are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 2.90-92. Drawn into the narrow waters of the Corinthian gulf to protect Naupactus, the Athenians were initially routed and divided, but 11 Athenian ships which were pursued into Naupactus were able to turn about on their pursuers and defeat the numerically superior force opposite them. This victory preserved Athenian naval supremacy in the Gulf and put an end to Peloponnesian attempts to challenge it during this period of the war.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 95-96 Legacy After a single land campaign in 428 BC in Acarnania, Phormio is not recorded as having held command again. In his few years of activity, however, he had left a deep imprint on the early course of the Peloponnesian War. An Athenian defeat in the Corinthian Gulf in 429/8 BC would have been a devastating blow to Athens' influence in the Greek north-east, and to the city's reputation for naval invincibility.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 95-6 After his death, the Athenians commemorated his service to the state by erecting a statue of him on the acropolis and burying his body in the state cemetery.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 96 Phormio's son, named Asopius after his grandfather, also commanded a naval expedition during the war.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.7A history of Greece By George William Cox.

The peninsula stretches about , from the Mull of Kintyre in the south to East Loch Tarbert in the north. The area immediately north of Kintyre is known as Knapdale. Kintyre is long and narrow, at no point more than from west coast to east coast, and is less than two miles wide where it connects to Knapdale. The east side of the Kintyre Peninsula is bounded by Kilbrannan Sound, with a number of coastal peaks such as Torr Mor. The central spine of the peninsula is mostly hilly moorland. The coastal areas and hinterland, however, are rich and fertile. Kintyre has long been a prized area for settlers, including the early Scots who migrated from Ulster to western Scotland and the Vikings or Norsemen who conquered and settled the area just before the start of the second millennium. The principal town of the area is Campbeltown (about by road from the Mull), which has been a royal burgh since the mid-18th century. The area's economy has long relied on fishing and farming, although Campbeltown has a reputation as a producer of some of the world's finest single malt whisky. Campbeltown Single Malts include the multi- award-winning Springbank. Kintyre Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary, one of the officers of arms at the Court of the Lord Lyon, is named after this peninsula. History= Beginnings  Dun Skeig Kintyre, like Knapdale, contains several Stone Age sites; at Ballochroy is a trio of megaliths aligned with land features on the island of Jura, while a number of burial cairns still stand at Blasthill (near Southend, Argyll). Remains from the Iron Age are no less present, with the imposing Dun Skeig, a Celtic hillfort, located at the northern edge of Kintyre. The history of the presumed Pictish inhabitants of Kintyre is not recorded, but a 2nd-century BC stone fort survives at Kildonan (near Saddell), and it is not implausible that they continued to use Dun Skeig. The tip of Kintyre is just 12 miles from Ulster, and there has long been interaction across the straits of Moyle, as evidenced by Neolithic finds in Kintyre, such as flint tools characteristic of Antrim. In the early first millennium, an Irish invasion led to Gaelic colonisation of an area centred on the Kintyre peninsula, establishing the Gaelic kingdom of D√°l Riata. The latter was divided into a handful of regions, controlled by particular kin groups, of which the most powerful, the Cen√©l nGabr√°in, ruled over Kintyre, along with Knapdale, the region between Loch Awe and Loch Fyne (Craignish, Ardscotnish, Glassary, and Glenary), Arran, and Moyle (in Ulster). The kingdom thrived for a few centuries, and formed a springboard for Christianisation of the mainland. Sanda, an island adjacent the south coast of Kintyre, is strongly associated with Ninian, the first known missionary to the Picts, and contains an early 5th century chapel said to have been built by him. In 563, Columba arrived in Kintyre, to pay his respects to the kings of Dal Riata, before continuing to Iona, where he established a base for missionary activity throughout the Pictish regions beyond.  Norwegian dominion  D√°l Riata was ultimately destroyed when Norse Vikings invaded, and established their own domain, spreading more extensively over the islands north and west of the mainland. Following the unification of Norway, they had become the Norwegian Kingdom of the Isles, locally controlled by Godred Crovan, and known by Norway as Su√∞reyjar (Old Norse, traditionally anglicised as Sodor), meaning southern isles. The former territory of Dal Riata acquired the geographic description Argyle (now Argyll): the Gaelic coast. Magnus dragging his boat across the isthmus, as depicted in an 1899 book In 1093, Magnus, the Norwegian king, launched a military campaign to assert his authority over the isles. Malcolm, the king of Scotland, responded with a written agreement, accepting that Magnus' had sovereign authority of over all the western lands that Magnus could encircle by boat. The unspecific wording led Magnus to have his boat dragged across the narrow isthmus at Tarbert, while he rode within it, so that he would thereby acquire Kintyre, in addition to the more natural islands of Arran and Bute. Supposedly, Magnus's campaign had been part of a conspiracy against Malcolm, by Donalbain, Malcolm's younger brother. When Malcolm was killed in battle a short time later, Donalbain invaded, seized the Scottish kingdom, and displaced Malcolm's sons from the throne; on becoming king, Donalbain confirmed Magnus' gains. Donalbain's apparent keenness to do this, however, weakened his support among the nobility, and Malcolm's son, Duncan, was able to depose him. A few years later, following a rebellion against Magnus' authority in the Isles, he launched another, fiercer, expedition. In 1098, aware of Magnus' actions, the new Scottish king, Edgar (another son of Malcolm), quitclaimed to Magnus all sovereign authority over the isles, and the whole of Kintyre and Knapdale. Saddell Abbey, founded by Reginald, a son of Somerled In the mid 12th century, Somerled, the husband of Godred Crovan's granddaughter, led a successful revolt against Norway, transforming Su√∞reyjar (including Kintyre) into an independent kingdom. After his death, nominal Norwegian authority was re-established, but de facto authority was split between Somerled's sons and the Crovan dynasty. The exact allocation to Somerled's sons is unclear, but following a family dispute, Donald, Somerled's grandson, acquired Kintyre, together with Knapdale, Islay, and Jura. Donald's father, Reginald, established Saddell Abbey, in 1207. In the mid 13th century, increased tension between Norway and Scotland led to a series of Battles, culminating in the Battle of Largs, shortly after which the Norwegian king died. In 1266, his more peaceable successor ceded his nominal authority over Su√∞reyjar to the Scottish king (Alexander III) by the Treaty of Perth, in return for a very large sum of money. Although Alexander III generally acknowledged the semi-independent authority of Somerled's heirs, he did not give them back control of the mainland territory which Scottish forces had taken during the strife, including parts of Kintyre.  Early Scottish rule  In 1293, king John Balliol established shrieval authority by creating the post of sheriff of Kintyre. Shortly after, Robert de Bruys launched a civil war challenging John for the throne. By this point, Somerled's descendants had formed into three families - the MacRory, the MacDougalls, and the MacDonalds; the MacDougalls took John's side, while the MacDonalds and MacRory backed de Bruys. When de Bruys defeated John, he declared the MacDougall lands forfeit, and gave them to the MacDonalds. The head of the MacDonald family married the heir of the MacRory family, thereby acquiring the remaining share of Somerled's realm, and transforming it into the Lordship of the Isles, which lasted for over a century. After 4 years and 3 children, however, he divorced Amy, and married Margaret, the daughter of Robert II, the Scottish king, who gave him the remaining parts of Kintyre, along with the whole of Knapdale, as a dowry. In 1462, however, John, the then Lord of the Isles, plotted with the English king to conquer Scotland; civil war in England delayed the discovery of this for a decade. Upon the discovery, in 1475, there was a call for forfeiture, but a year later John calmed the matter, by quitclaiming Ross (Easter, Wester, and Skye), Kintyre, and Knapdale, to Scotland.  The Campbells and later  The remains of Tarbert castle At an uncertain date before 1481, the sheriffdom of Kintyre became Tarbertshire, based at Tarbert at the northern end of Kintyre; in that year, Tarbertshire was expanded to include Knapdale. However, comital authority remained absent following the quitclaim from the Lord of the Isles; following a law and order crisis in the region, king James IV of Scotland appointed Archibald Campbell, the Earl of Argyll as governor of Tarbert Castle, with implied authority over nearby castles such as Skipness. Following the Scottish Reformation, the MacDonalds (opponents) and Campbells (supporters) came into more direct dispute. In 1607, after a series of hostile actions by the MacDonalds, King James VI ordered their lands in Kintyre to be transferred to Archibald Campbell, heir of the earlier Archibald. Under pressure from the Campbells, the sheriff court moved to Inveraray at the extreme northeast of Tarbertshire, near the heart of Campbell power; somewhat inevitably, in 1633 shrieval authority was annexed by the sheriff of Argyll. Archibald's son, a dedicated supporter of the religious reformers, developed a plan to establish a large settlement, around the village of Kinlochkilkerran, at the south of Kintyre, composed of loyal Presbyterians from Lowland Scotland, in order to outnumber and undermine the local Catholic population, and reduce resistance to the state's religious reforms. Under his son, Archibald, this became Campbeltown. Their actions also had the effect of diluting Gaelic culture, gradually replacing it with a Lowlands one. Comital powers were abolished by the Heritable Jurisdictions Act, leaving only the shrieval unit. In 1899, counties were formally created, on shrieval boundaries, by a Scottish Local Government Act; Kintyre became part of the County of Argyll. Following late 20th century reforms, it is now within the wider region of Argyll and Bute.

He is perhaps best known today for his publication of The English Dancing Master in 1651. Biography Playford was born in Norwich, the younger son of John Playford. He served an apprenticeship in London with publisher John Benson from 1639/40 to 1647, after which he remained in the capital, opening a shop in the porch of Temple Church. Playford was clerk to the church, and probably resided with his wife Hannah over the shop until 1659. He was, it appears (from the title- pages of his publications) temporarily in partnership with John Benson in 1652, and with Zachariah Watkins in 1664 and 1665. Under the Commonwealth (1649‚Äì60), and for some years of Charles II's reign, Playford almost monopolised the business of music publishing in England. His shop was the meeting-place of musical enthusiasts; Samuel Pepys was a frequent customer. Bookseller, publisher, and member of the Stationers' Company, Playford published books on music theory, instruction books for several instruments, and psalters with tunes for singing in churches. He is perhaps best known today for his publication of The English Dancing Master in 1651, during the period of the Puritan-dominated Commonwealth (later editions were known as 'The Dancing Master'). This work contains both the music and instructions for English country dances. This came about after Playford, working as a war correspondent, was captured by Cromwell's men and told that, if he valued his freedom (as a sympathiser with the King), he might consider a change of career. Although many of the tunes in the book are attributed to him today, he probably did not write any of them. Most were popular melodies that had existed for years. During the Restoration period, on the other hand, he endeavoured to encourage serious tastes. In 1662 he dedicated the 'Cantica Sacra' to Queen Henrietta Maria. He regretfully observed in 1666 that 'all solemn musick was much laid aside, being esteemed too heavy and dull for the light heels and brains of this nimble and wanton age,' and he therefore ventured to 'new string the harp of David' by issuing fresh editions of his 'Skill of Music,' with music for church service, in 1674, and, in 1677, 'The Whole Book of Psalms' in which he gave for the first time the church tunes to the cantus part. In typographical technique Playford's most original improvement was the invention in 1658 of 'the new-ty'd note.' These were quavers or semiquavers connected in pairs or series by one or two horizontal strokes at the end of their tails, the last note of the group retaining in the early examples the characteristic up-stroke. Hawkins observes that the Dutch printers were the first to follow the lead in this detail. In 1665 he caused every semibreve to be barred in the dance tunes; in 1672 he began engraving on copper plates. Generally, however, Playford clung to old methods; he recommended the use of lute tablature to ordinary violin players; and he resisted, in an earnest letter of remonstrance (1673), Thomas Salmon's proposals for a readjustment of clefs. Playford's printers were: Thomas Harper, 1648‚Äì1652; William Godbid, 1658‚Äì1678; Ann Godbid and her partner John Playford the younger, 1679‚Äì1683; John Playford alone, 1684-1685. By 1665 Playford and his wife moved from the Temple to a large house opposite Islington Church, where Mrs. Playford kept a boarding-school until her death in October 1679. By November 1680, Playford had established himself in a house in Arundel Street 'near the Thames side, the lower end, over against the George.' He suffered from a long illness in that year, and retired, leaving the main running of the business to his son Henry Playford (see below). He brought out, in his own name, a collection of catches in 1685; 'The Dancing Master' of 1686 was the last work for which he was responsible. He apparently died in Arundel Street about November 1686. His will was written on 5 Nov. 1686, neither signed nor witnessed, and only proved in August 1694, the handwriting being identified by witnesses. He was probably buried in the Temple Church as he desired, although the registers do not record his name. Henry Purcell and John Blow attended the funeral. Several elegies upon his death were published; one written by Nahum Tate, and set to music by Purcell, appeared in 1687. Playford's original compositions were few and slight, and included some vocal and instrumental pieces in the following collections: 'Catch ... or the Musical Companion,' 1667; 'Choice Songs,' 1673; 'Cantica Sacra,' 1674; 'The Whole Book of Psalms and 'The Harmonicon'. Family=Henry Playford After Playford's death, his only surviving son, Henry Playford (5 May 1657 - 1706?), carried on the business at the shop near the Temple Church. In partnership with Robert Carr, Henry published three books of 'The Theatre of Musick;' the fourth book and his other publications appeared independently of Carr. In 1694, he sold his copyright in 'The Dancing Master' to printer, John Heptinstall. From 1696 to 1703, Playford traded in the \\"Temple Exchange\\" 'over against St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet Street.' He employed as printers, John Playford the younger, 1685; Charles Peregrine, 1687; E. Jones, 1687, 1696; John Heptinstall, 1696; and William Pearson, 1698. Around 1701 he instituted weekly clubs for the practice of music, which flourished in Oxford as well as in London. Playford, in order to meet competition from purveyors of cheap music, established, in 1699, a music concert to be held three evenings in the week at a coffee house. Here his music was to be sold, and might be heard at the request of any prospective purchaser. He complained of the expense of good-quality paper, and of the scandalous abuse of selling single songs at a penny a piece, a practice 'which hindered good collections.' In 1703 Playford invited subscriptions to the 'Monthly Collections of Music' to be sent to his house in Arundel Street, The Strand, 'over against the Blue Ball.' From 1703 to 1707 he also seems to have engaged in selling prints, paintings, 'and other adornments.' In 1706, his warehouse was a room 'up one pair of stairs next the Queen's Head Tavern over against the Middle Temple Gate.' His name appears on the fifth edition of ' The Pleasant Musical Companion,' dated 1707, but as a rule these publications were antedated; and his name does not occur again in advertisements or on title-pages. He died between 1706 and 1721, when his will was proved. He left a legacy to Henry Purcell, and the bulk of his property to his wife Ann (n√©e Baker - daughter of Thomas Baker of Oxford), whom he had married in December 1688. John Playford the Younger The music printer and stationer John Playford the younger (1656‚Äì1686), nephew of John Playford the elder, entered in 1679 into partnership with Ann, the widow of William Godbid, in the printing-house at Little Britain, 'the ancient and only printing-house in England for variety of musick and workmen that understand it.' It was also the chief printing-house for setting up mathematical works. Playford's firm printed the sixth edition of 'The Dancing Master ' in 1679, and other musical publications. In 1684, Mrs. Godbid's name disappeared, and Playford continued the business alone. His last work for his uncle was the seventh edition of 'The Dancing Master,' dated 1686; he printed only one of Henry's publications, 'The Theatre of Musick,' 1685. He died in that year, and was buried in Great Stanmore church. Playford left his property to his mother Eleanor, and to his two sisters, Anne (wife of William Killigrew), and Eleanor (who afterwards married William Walker). The printing-house (and dwelling house) was advertised for sale in the 'London Gazette' of 6 May 1686.

Ratchets are widely used in machinery and tools. The word ratchet is also used informally to refer to a ratcheting socket wrench.  Theory of operation  A ratchet moving in its \\"forward\\" direction A ratchet consists of a round gear or a linear rack with teeth, and a pivoting, spring-loaded finger called a pawl (or click, in clocks and watcheshautehorlogerie.org) that engages the teeth. The teeth are uniform but asymmetrical, with each tooth having a moderate slope on one edge and a much steeper slope on the other edge. When the teeth are moving in the unrestricted (i.e. forward) direction, the pawl easily slides up and over the gently sloped edges of the teeth, with a spring forcing it (often with an audible 'click') into the depression between the teeth as it passes the tip of each tooth. When the teeth move in the opposite (backward) direction, however, the pawl will catch against the steeply sloped edge of the first tooth it encounters, thereby locking it against the tooth and preventing any further motion in that direction.  Backlash  Because the ratchet can only stop backward motion at discrete points (i.e., at tooth boundaries), a ratchet does allow a limited amount of backward motion. This backward motion‚Äîwhich is limited to a maximum distance equal to the spacing between the teeth‚Äîis called backlash. In cases where backlash must be minimized, a smooth, toothless ratchet with a high friction surface such as rubber is sometimes used. The pawl bears against the surface at an angle so that any backward motion will cause the pawl to jam against the surface and thus prevent any further backward motion. Since the backward travel distance is primarily a function of the compressibility of the high friction surface, this mechanism can result in significantly reduced backlash.  Uses  Ratchet mechanisms are used in a wide variety of applications, including these: * Cable ties * Capstans * Caulking guns * Clocks * Freewheel (overrunning clutch) * Grease guns * Handcuffs * Jacks * Anti-rollback devices used in roller coasters * Looms * Slacklines * Tie down straps * Turnstiles * Typewriters  Gallery  File:First socket wrench.pngRatcheting socket wrench or spanner File:Comealong.jpgA ratchet lever hoist, also known as a 'come-along' File:ZipTieCrossSection.JPGThe ratchet mechanism of a cable tie  See also  * Brownian ratchet * Freewheel * Sprag clutch * Check valve, a device that allows fluids to flow in only one direction * Diode, a device that allows electric current to flow in only one direction  References  Category:Mechanisms (engineering) ","title":"Ratchet (device)"},{"id":"455627","text":"is a Japanese kanji referring to a school in any discipline. In English, the word is frequently used to refer to schools of Japanese martial art, although it can also be found used in other disciplines (for example Nihon-kory≈´ and S≈çgetsu-ry≈´ in ikebana, Kantei-ry≈´ in calligraphy, etc.). In the martial arts Japanese martial arts are often classified and codified into ry≈´ha. Usually a given style will have its own curriculum, ranks and licensure system. These may be based on the parent style or a combination of sources that form the background of the system. The name of a style may have particular meaning or may simply be a location. Toyama-ry≈´ is named for the Toyama Military Academy in Japan. In contrast, G≈çj≈´-ry≈´ is the 'hard-soft' style, which indicates both characteristic techniques and thematic elements that form a 'signature' of the style. Sometimes this is merged or confused with the name of the d≈çj≈ç (as is the case with Sh≈çt≈çkan-ry≈´ karate). High- level practitioners of an established style may splinter off and form their own derivative styles based on their own experience or interpretation. Sometimes this is encouraged by the parent style, sometimes it represents an ideological schism between senior members of the style. Sometimes, it is done simply for 'marketing' reasons or to adjust a system to modern times. There is no universal licensing or ranking system across all ry≈´ha. A high-ranking person or black belt in one style does not necessarily correspond to a high level understanding in another style or group of styles. There are many ry≈´ha in Japan that have existed for many hundreds of years, as well as many more that were created in modern times. The concept of organizing a codified system is obviously not a Japanese or outwardly Asian one, though many international or foreign styles may adopt the nomenclature and systemization of kory≈´ bujutsu ry≈´ha in order to add an air of mystique or legitimacy to their system, or simply as a way to show respect to their roots and background.

He is also called Robert Blanchemains (meaning \\"White Hands\\" in French). Life He was the son of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, a staunch supporter of Henry II, and he inherited from his father large estates in England and Normandy. When the revolt of the younger Henry broke out in April 1173, Robert went to his castle at Breteuil in Normandy. The rebels' aim was to take control of the duchy, but Henry II himself led an army to besiege the castle; Robert fled, and the Breteuil was taken on September 25 or 26. Robert apparently went to Flanders, where he raised a large force of mercenaries, and landed at Walton, Suffolk, on 29 September 1173. He joined forces with Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, and the two marched west, aiming to cut England in two across the Midlands and to relieve the king's siege of Robert's castle at Leicester. However, they were intercepted by the king's supporters and defeated at the Battle of Fornham near Fornham, near Bury St Edmunds, on 17 October. Robert, along with his wife and many others, was taken prisoner. Henry II took away the earl's lands and titles as well. He remained in captivity until January 1177, well after most of the other prisoners had been released. The king was in a strong position and could afford to be merciful; not long after his release Robert's lands and titles were restored, but not his castles. All but two of his castles had been destroyed, and those two (Montsorrel in Leicestershire and Pacy in Normandy) remained in the king's hands. Robert had little influence in the remaining years of Henry II's reign, but was restored to favour by Richard I. He carried one of the swords of state at Richard's coronation in 1189. In 1190 Robert went on the third crusade to Palestine, but he died at Dyrrachium on his return journey. Family Robert married Petronilla, who was a daughter of William de Grandmesnil and great-granddaughter and eventual heiress to the English lands of Domesday baron, Hugh de Grandmesnil. They had five children: * Robert, who succeeded his father as Earl of Leicester; * Roger, who became Bishop of St Andrews in 1189; * William, possibly the ancestor of the House of Hamilton;Cowan,Vol I,p80Balfour Paul Vol IV, p339 * Amicia, who married Simon de Montfort (died 1188), and whose son Simon subsequently became Earl of Leicester; * Margaret, who married Saer de Quincy, later 1st Earl of Winchester.

It is located on Front Street West, on the south side of the block bounded by Bay Street and York Street in downtown Toronto. The municipal government of Toronto owns the station building while the provincial transit agency Metrolinx owns the train shed and trackage. Union Station has been a National Historic Site of Canada since 1975, and a Heritage Railway Station since 1989. It is operated by the Toronto Terminals Railway, a joint venture of the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway that directs and controls train movement along the Union Station Rail Corridor, the largest and busiest rail corridor in Canada. Its central position in Canada's busiest inter-city rail service area, \\"The Corridor\\", as well as being the central hub of GO Transit's commuter rail service, makes Union Station Canada's busiest transportation facility and the second-busiest railway station in North America, serving over 72 million passengers each year. More than half of all Canadian inter-city passengers and 91% of Toronto commuter train passengers travel through Union Station. Via Rail and Amtrak provide inter-city train services while GO Transit operates regional rail services. The station is also connected to the subway and streetcar system of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) at its adjacent namesake subway station. GO Transit's Union Station Bus Terminal, across Bay Street from the station building, is connected by the trainshed. The Union Pearson Express, the train service to Toronto Pearson International Airport, platform is a short walk west of the main station building, accessible by the SkyWalk. Site location Front Street between York and Bay Street. Toronto's Union Station is located at 61 Front Street West, between Bay and York Streets in Toronto's business district, with Toronto's entertainment district beginning across Bay Street. It is roughly at the city's east-west centre. It is also close to Lake Ontario, which marks Toronto's southern boundary. The southernmost part of the Gardiner Expressway, which lies between Union Station and Lake Ontario, provides easy core access to GO Transit buses. Union Station's columned fa√ßade and main entrance faces north, towards downtown Toronto. The Fairmont Royal York Hotel, a former railway hotel, is directly across Front Street from Union Station and can be accessed from the station both at street level and underground via the PATH. The Dominion Public Building, another building from the same era, is just to the east of the station, at the corner of Front and Bay Streets. Other major buildings near Union Station are Telus Tower and Brookfield Place. Brookfield Place is home to the Allen Lambert Galleria, a six story high pedestrian thoroughfare, as well as the Hockey Hall of Fame, which holds the Stanley Cup. Scotiabank Arena, Rogers Centre, Metro Toronto Convention Centre, and the CN Tower are all close by, and are visible from some parts of the station. Like Union Station, these structures were built on former Railway Lands. All of them can be accessed directly from Union Station via the Skywalk. The land around the CN Tower has been converted to a public park. Union Station will soon be linked via PATH bridge on east side to Backstage Condominium building (Esplanade and Yonge corner). Structure Toronto's Union Station is Canada's largest and most opulent railway station. The Montreal architecture firm of Ross and Macdonald designed the building in the Beaux-Art style as a joint venture between the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway, with help from CPR architect Hugh Jones and Toronto architect John M. Lyle. In 1975, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada cited its design as being of \\"national architectural significance as one of the finest examples of Beaux-Arts railway station design in Canada\\". The bilaterally symmetrical building comprises three connecting box masses facing Front Street West, with the main structure in the middle. Together, the three parts measure long and occupy the entire south side of the block between Bay Street in the east and York Street in the west. The facade of the Front Street entrance includes 22 colonnaded loggia constructed with limestone. The exterior Front Street fa√ßade is laid out in an ashlar pattern, constructed with smooth beige Indiana and Queenston limestone. The colonnaded loggia which faces Front Street features 22 equally spaced Roman Tuscan columns made from Bedford limestone, each high and weighing 75 tons. Fourteen three-storey bays, each with severely delineated fenestration, form the fa√ßade on either side of the central colonnade for a total of 28 bays. The structures at either end have an additional ten bays. Three rectangular windows fill each bay, lighting the interior hall with plenty of natural light. However, the building's external profile is hard and flat, with a line of huge columns, heavy ornamentation and strong symmetry. The recessed main entrance is framed by two sets of four columns, with relief wreaths carved into the entablature above the columns. These columns are composed of three separate segments on top of an incongruous octagonal plinth, implying an Ionic order or Corinthian order; however, the capital is sculpted in a Doric order. Consequently, these columns appear to be unfinished. The original plan for the columns is not known. A wraparound dentil cornice and a recessed peaked hipped roof creates the illusion of a flat roof, just like a palazzo. On either side of the main entrance, a blind arch with an ornamental keystone contains a set of three steel-framed doors, along with a large arched window. Decorative friezes separate the arched window from the doors. When these entryway elements are combined, they create a processional experience through the entryway into the grand interior space. The flat-roof illusion, together with the axial symmetry, classical detailing in both structural and decorative elements, heavy ornamentation, and formal setting is typical of the Beaux-Arts style. The station housed a gun range on the seventh floor from 1927 until 2008. The range was operated for \\"Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway police to practice their shooting skills. It eventually opened to members of the public\\". It was known as the Canadian National Recreation Association (CNRA) handgun club. The city closed the range in 2008 as a symbolic gesture to its effort to reduce gun violence. Great Hall and Via Concourse The front entranceway opens on to the expansive Ticket Lobby, informally known as the \\"Great Hall\\". This part of Union Station runs the entire length of the main section. It is long and high at its highest point. Like the outside facade, enduring materials such as bronze, limestone, marble, tiles, and translucent glass create a sense of enduring quality. Union Station's Ticket Lobby, or \\"Great Hall\\", is lit with diffused natural light from clerestory windows throughout the lobby. The entire space is lit with diffused natural light from clerestory windows refracted throughout the lobby. Each end of the Great Hall also features four-storey tall arched windows, based on those of Roman baths. The two-storey-high vaulted ceiling, which is what makes it look from the front as though a second building were rising behind the colonnade, is made of coffered Guastavino tiles. The walls are faced with Zumbro stone from Missouri, and the floors are constructed of Tennessee marble laid in a herringbone pattern. Below the cornice surrounding the \\"Great Hall\\" are carved the names of many Canadian destinations, from the east coast to Vancouver, accessible by the Grand Trunk Railway or Canadian Pacific Railway at the time of the station's construction. Many remain destinations on Via Rail routes. Via Rail's ticket, baggage, and information counters are in this space, mostly lined against the north wall. (Via Rail ticket agents also handle all ticketing sales and baggage services for Amtrak.) Small restaurants and other stores line the opposite wall. The main clock and the main departures board are in the centre of the space. Stairwells at either end of the hall lead to the arrivals area one floor below and connect to urban transit. Benches are near the stairwells for passengers and those meeting them, although most prefer to wait in the departure area, down the large ramp in the centre of the south wall. The departure area is a large, wide space under the tracks. The area holds the largest seating areas, as well as lounges for Via 1 passengers. Seventeen gates line the east and west walls of the departure area, each with escalators going to track level. Stairways at the ends of the \\"Great Hall\\" lead to the Arrivals Concourse Via Rail and Amtrak use for inter-city train passengers, as well as GO Transit concourses, TTC subway and streetcar and the PATH pedestrian tunnel network. GO Concourses and Teamways Connections with GO Transit services can be accessed through the York Concourse. Passengers can connect with GO Transit services through the York Concourse, which opened on April 27, 2015, west of Union Station. This new concourse supplemented the York South Concourse that provided access to platforms 24 to 27. The York and York South Concourses connect to the York East Teamway, as well as an entrance to a PATH tunnel leading across Front Street, between York Street and University Avenue. The York West Teamway is connected to Union Station via the Skywalk. Historically, the Bay Street Concourse was the hub of GO Transit operations for almost 40 years.Go Transit's Bay Concourse To Undergo Major Renovation The Bay Concourse closed on August 16, 2015 for approximately two years while it undergoes revitalization. The Bay West Teamway is open as it too undergoes revitalization, providing access to platforms 3 to 13 and the Bay South Concourse. The Bay East Teamway provides access to platforms 3 to 13, and is connected to the Union Station Bus Terminal. Train shed A glass atrium forms the central portion of the train shed. Trains arrive and depart from the train shed, which contains 23 platforms (11 island platforms and one side platform) south of the Great Hall. The train shed was designed by A.R. Ketterson, and built in 1929-1930. It is a variation of the Bush train shed invented by Lincoln Bush. A reconstruction of the trainshed began in January 2010. The east and west sides of the shed, totalling approximately , are being renovated and restored with input from Parks Canada to help preserve its heritage character. This renovation will also see a green roof installed, reducing the urban heat island effect and stormwater runoff. The central portion of the original trainshed, totalling , was removed and replaced with a glass atrium. The structure floats above the tracks, and allows daylight to reach the platforms. Most Toronto-area railway freight does not enter downtown Toronto. Local freight movements are permitted on two dedicated tracks south of the train shed, allowing freight trains to go east towards Pickering, and west towards Burlington. West wing and SkyWalk Union Station's west wing is west of the Great Hall. Metrolinx is headquartered in the west wing at 97 Front Street. Across from these offices is an official tourism information centre that provides maps, visitor guides, brochures and tourism specialists to provide help to city visitors. A pathway known as the SkyWalk continues west from the west wing, overtop of York Street. The SkyWalk is considered part of the PATH network, and connects Union to the CN Tower and Rogers Centre. It is also the location of the Union Pearson Express station. History Toronto's third and current Union Station was constructed between 1914 and 1920 by the TTR. Prince Edward, Prince of Wales officially opened it to the public on August 6, 1927, in a lavish ribbon cutting ceremony using a pair of gold scissors. In attendance were Prince George, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario William Donald Ross and his wife, Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Stanley Baldwin and Mrs. Baldwin, Premier of Ontario George Howard Ferguson, and many other members of the Government of Ontario and Government of Canada. Predecessor stations second Union Station several years after its opening in 1878. The current Union Station's history can be traced to 1858, when the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) opened Toronto's first Union Station west of the present Union Station. The wooden structure was shared with the Northern Railway and the Great Western Railway. This structure was replaced by a second Union Station on the same site, opening in 1873. The Canadian Pacific Railway began using the facility in 1884 and it was completely rebuilt, opening in 1896. The Great Toronto Fire of 1904 destroyed the block south of Front Street West, immediately east of the second Union Station (bounded by Bay and York streets), but did not damage the station. The GTR acquired this land east of the second Union Station for a new passenger terminal and in 1905 both the GTR and the CPR decided to proceed with the design and construction of a third union station. Excavations for the third Union Station in 1915, with second Union Station in background. The decision to undertake the third union station was made against a backdrop of significant change in the Canadian railway industry. At the same time, the Government of Canada was encouraging the GTR to build a second transcontinental railway (what would become the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the National Transcontinental Railway) and the Canadian Northern Railway was undertaking an aggressive expansion across the prairies and into southern Ontario. Construction On July 13, 1906, the Toronto Terminals Railway (TTR) was incorporated to \\"construct, provide, maintain and operate at the City of Toronto a union passenger station\\". The TTR was jointly owned by the GTR and the CPR who each held 50% of the TTR shares. The TTR supervised construction of the new station which began in 1914 and proceeded to 1920, having faced significant delays in the shortage of construction material and workers as a result of the First World War, as well as the GTR's deteriorating financial position due to its ill-fated transcontinental GTPR railway project. The resulting construction saw the elimination of Lorne Street located between Simcoe and Bay from Front to Esplanade with tracks leading west of the new station now in place. Although the new station's headhouse and east and west office wings (the station building visible from Front Street West) were completed in 1920, it did not open to the public for another seven years until the system of approach tracks were designed and implemented by the TTR and its owners. During this time in 1923, the bankrupt GTR was fully nationalized by the Government of Canada and merged into the Canadian National Railways (CNR), which would assume the GTR's 50% ownership of the TTR and thus the third Union Station. Edward, Prince of Wales. Although the station was incomplete, its building was complete and the station was opened on August 6, 1927 by the Prince of Wales. Four days later, the track network was shifted from the second Union Station. To get to trains, passengers would walk from the south doors to the tracks located several hundred feet to the south while the new viaduct, concourse and train shed was under construction. Demolition of the second Union Station began almost immediately and was completed in 1928. The third Union Station project was not fully completed until 1930 when the train shed was completed; its construction was supervised by the TTR from 1925‚Äì1930. The TTR also constructed a central heating plant at the corner of York and Fleet streets (now Lake Shore Boulevard West) to replace the original Toronto Hydro plant on Scott Street which had been expropriated by the TTR to build the approach track viaduct to the new station. It was fuelled by coal delivered by a CNR siding and was the largest such facility in Canada when it opened in 1929; it produced 150,000 kg/330,000 pounds of steam per hour and 270 million kg/600 million pounds annually to heat the station, the passenger cars in the train shed, CNR and CPR yard facilities in the area now occupied by the Gardiner Expressway, Rogers Centre and Scotiabank Arena, the CPR's Royal York Hotel, the Dominion Public Building, the federal post office building adjacent to the station and the CN/CP Telecommunications building on Front Street. Subway connection subway line. The first major change to Union Station took place in 1954 when the Toronto Transit Commission opened its Union subway station adjacent to Union Station but buried beneath Front Street West. This subway station acted as the southern terminus of its new subway line. The subway station included a direct tunnel connection to the lower level passenger concourse. This passageway was closed and replaced by the direct connection between the railway station and the subway station in 1979 when the subway station mezzanine was renovated and enlarged. In 1990, the TTC's Harbourfront LRT project added an underground streetcar loop now used by the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina streetcar lines. TTC passengers using the Union subway and streetcar station may transfer between both modes without entering the Union Station proper. Metro Centre redevelopment proposal During the early 1970s, Canada's two major passenger railways, the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National, were reducing their services to the bare minimum mandated under the Canadian Transport Commission, largely as a result of unsustainable losses resulting from increased competition in new subsidized four-lane highways and airports. Construction for the CN Tower in 1973. Plans to redevelop the Railway Lands surfaced with freight traffic being diverted outside the downtown core. The third Union Station's future was looking bleak by 1972 when both railways sought to increase return on their underutilized waterfront rail classification yards which was being viewed as valuable real estate. Both CN and CP began to abandon their extensive waterfront rail classification yards south of the passenger station to make way for urban redevelopment. The Gardiner Expressway project was constructed over part of the railway property and CN had proposed constructing a telecommunication tower (what would become the CN Tower later that decade). CN and CPR proposed a \\"Metro Centre\\" development on the south side of Front Street on the site of Union Station and proposed to demolish the structure (which was costing an increasing amount of property taxes but not bringing in revenue). The proposed Metro Centre development was strikingly similar to what occurred with New York City's Penn Station and would have consisted of an underground fourth Union Station (the terminal trackage would have been buried), a convention centre, a telecommunications tower, along with complementary office and retail developments. Local opposition to the proposal was successful in having the city council's decision to support the Metro Centre development overturned and Union Station was saved. Although it was converted from coal to natural gas, the Central Heating Plant built in 1929 was decommissioned in the 1980s, and demolished in 1990. It is now site of The Ice condo towers In 1978, CN and CP transferred responsibility for their passenger rail services to Via Rail, a new federal crown corporation; however, CN and CP retained their 50% ownership shares of the TTR. Growth and waterfront development The SkyWalk was constructed over the train tracks of Union Station to connect the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and Rogers Centre with the rest of the PATH pedestrian network. The GO Transit commuter rail agency which was established on May 23, 1967, had been undergoing unprecedented expansion which was seeing Union Station see passenger levels that outstripped some of the busiest airports in the world. The consolidated TTR trackage included a flyover west of the station to permit freight trains to cross CN's Oakville subdivision without blocking GO Transit's commuter trains. The flyover was constructed in 1982-83 and also allowed GO trains destined for the CN Weston subdivision to cross over the tracks used by GO and Via trains using the CN Oakville subdivision. The CN Tower had revamped the vision of Toronto's waterfront rail yards and proposals were made to construct what would later become SkyDome (1989) and Air Canada Centre (1999), resulting in further changes to the Union Station trackage. The PATH pedestrian tunnel network was built to connect Union Station's passengers with many of the downtown office towers and the SkyWalk was constructed over the terminal trackage west of the station to connect the PATH with the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and Rogers Centre. 21st century revitalization Union Station's southern entrance was opened in 2010. Renovations of the station's train sheds may be seen in the background.In 2000, the City of Toronto purchased the station building from the TTR, while GO Transit purchased the railway corridor and the Union Station train shed. On July 24, 2003, the City of Toronto agreed to lease Union Station to Union Pearson AirLink Group, a subsidiary of SNC-Lavalin, for a term of 100 years. A subsequent announcement on May 24, 2006, addressed several issues for commuters including: constructing a direct connection from the GO Concourse to the PATH pedestrian tunnel system, a new eastbound platform for the Union TTC station, improved access to streetcars at Union TTC station, and improved capacity for inter- city railway passengers. These developments were part of a $100 million initiative announced by the city and its transit authorities, along with the Government of Ontario and Government of Canada. On August 5, 2009, the Toronto City Council approved an update of this plan which was projected to cost $640 million, with construction lasting from 2010 to 2014. Much of the work was undertaken by or managed by Carillion. Union Food Court, the first phase of the lower retail level, was opened in January 2019 The work also involved a complete overhaul of the GO concourses, deepening them to create two storeys of space. The lower level (the food court section of which opened in January 2019) will provide retail space and room for pedestrian traffic flow, and the upper storey will be dedicated to passenger traffic onto the platforms. This will expand not only the current GO concourse in the east of the building, but also open up the western end; GO Transit's presence in the building will nearly quadruple. Additional aesthetic points include glass roofs over the moat space around the north sides of the building, and a tall atrium over the central portions of the platforms. A new southern entrance, adjacent to the Air Canada Centre, opened in 2010. The 2009 Ontario and Canada government budgets included financing to assist GO, Via and the city in redeveloping and restoring the station. Track has been upgraded with better signals and snow cleaning devices to reduce winter delays to train movement. In 2016, it was realized that the renovated train shed roof was too low to allow electrification. The train shed roof is considered a heritage feature and cannot be removed. Remedies considered were raising the roof, or lowering the track level. By early 2018, the cost had increased from $640 million to an estimated $823.5 million. Work that was to have been completed in 2015 was projected to be finished late 2018 and in late 2018 revised to 2019.https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/11/13/construction-on-union- station-pushed-back-until-2019.html In 2019 it was announced that the city's portion of construction would be complete in 2019, but then Metrolinx would have to start its work, with a projected 2020 completion date. In February 2019, charges were laid by Toronto Fire Services against contactor Bondfield Construction and the city for an over-crowding issue where doors had been blocked. In March 2019 it was reported that Vaughan-based contractor Bondfield Construction had applied for bankruptcy protection under the Companies‚Äô Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA). Heritage recognition Union Station became designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1975, and a Heritage Railway Station in 1989. In 1999, Union Station was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame as being significant in the course of railway history. The station is recognized as part of the Union Station Heritage Conservation District (Designated Part V) under the Ontario Heritage Act enacted by Toronto City Council on July 27, 2006. Passenger services Timetable for inter-city rail services in the Great Hall. Union Station is the busiest public transportation structure of any kind in Canada, including air travel. It handles 65 million passengers annually, with an average of 200,000 passengers each day. Approximately two-thirds of those passengers are GO train or GO bus commuters, while another 20 million take the subway. The remainder are intercity travellers between other cities in Canada and the United States. National Toronto is Canada's primary passenger train hub. Consequently, Union Station is by far Via Rail's busiest and most-used station. Each year, 2.4 million Via Rail passengers pass through Union Station, representing more than half of all Via Rail passengers carried systemwide. This heavy usage is partly due to Union Station's position at the centre of Canada's busiest inter-city rail service area, the \\"Corridor\\", which stretches from Quebec City in the east to Windsor in the west. Via Rail train waiting in Union Station. The station is Via Rail's most used facility. Westbound Via Rail trains from Toronto connect directly to most major cities in Southwestern Ontario, including Kitchener, London, Sarnia, and Windsor. Additionally, westbound trains from Montreal pass through Toronto en route to Burlington. Northbound and eastbound Via Rail trains from Toronto primarily serve the heavily travelled Ottawa-Montreal-Toronto triangle. At Montreal, passengers can connect to trains heading to the Maritimes or north to the Laurentians. Union Station is also the eastern terminus of The Canadian, Via Rail's transcontinental service westbound to Vancouver via Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Edmonton. International Maple Leaf departing from Union Station to New York City. In partnership with Via Rail, Amtrak runs the Maple Leaf train from Toronto to New York City. The train uses Amtrak rolling stock, but is operated by Via crews north of Niagara Falls, Ontario. Other major U.S. destinations along the route include Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany. Amtrak and Via Rail formerly operated the International Limited from Toronto to Chicago via the Sarnia-Port Huron border crossing, until it was cancelled in 2004. Both VIA Rail and Amtrak maintain service along the route on their respective sides of the border, but the trains do not cross the border.

Connecting services The station includes access to the Toronto subway system. Union Station is connected to the Toronto Transit Commission's Union Subway Station, which is part of Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity of the Toronto subway system. Two Toronto streetcar routes, 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina, can also be accessed underground without leaving Union Station. The streetcar platform was built in 1989 and is separate from the subway station platforms built in 1954. Altogether, twenty million TTC passengers pass through Union Station each year. The TTC station was renovated and expanded in 2015, with an additional platform to increase capacity. Toronto Transit Commission bus routes 6 Bay, 72 Pape, 97 Yonge and night route 320 Yonge, use curbside stops on the streets outside. Airport link On June 6, 2015, the Union Pearson Express (UPX), a dedicated airport rail link service, started running between Union Station and Toronto Pearson International Airport, stopping only at Bloor and Weston GO stations. The opening of the line allowed Metrolinx to achieve its goal, announced in 2010, of operating an airport rail link from Union Station in time for the 2015 Pan American Games. Union Pearson Express Union Station, located west of the main Union Station building. Trains on this line do not stop at the regular platforms used by GO and Via trains, but use a separate station located west of the main station building along the length of the main atrium of the SkyWalk between York Street and Lower Simcoe Street. The UP Express Union Station is a 5-minute walk from Union subway station. Trains depart from the station's single side platform every 15 minutes. Passengers access trains directly from an enclosed waiting area, and a glass wall with sliding doors separate trains from the platform and open to allow passengers to board directly from the waiting area without exposure to the elements. The floor of the waiting area is level with the train floor, which allows for step-free boarding. The UP Express Union Station has a dedicated customer service counter, ticket vending machines and flight check-in kiosks. These kiosks permit check-ins for Air Canada and WestJet. Three stands in the waiting area offer Balzac's coffee, souvenirs and Mill Street Brewery draft beer.

The design was later selected as Messerschmitt's competitor in the Reichsluftfahrtministeriums (the German Air Ministry) Amerikabomber programme, for a strategic bomber capable of attacking New York City from bases in France or the Azores. Three prototypes were built but production was abandoned to allow Messerschmitt to concentrate on fighter production and the Junkers Ju 390 was selected in its place. Development continued as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft instead. Development The origin of the Me 264 design came from Messerschmitt's long-range reconnaissance aircraft project, the P.1061, of the late 1930s. A variant on the P.1061 was the P.1062 of which three prototypes were built, with only two \\"engines\\" to the P.1061's four, but they were, in fact, the more powerful Daimler-Benz DB 606 \\"power systems\\", each comprising a pair of DB 601 inverted V-12 engines. These were also successfully used in the long-range Messerschmitt Me 261, itself originating as the Messerschmitt P.1064 design of 1937. The DB 606's later use in the Heinkel He 177A's airframe design resulted in derision by Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring as \\"welded-together engines\\" in August 1942, due to badly designed engine installations. In early 1941, six P.1061 prototypes were ordered from Messerschmitt, under the designation Me 264. This was later reduced to three prototypes. The progress of these projects was initially slow, but after Germany had declared war on the United States, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) started the more serious Amerikabomber programme in the spring of 1942 for a very long range bomber, with the result that a larger, six-engine aircraft with a greater bomb load was called for. Proposals were put forward for the Junkers Ju 390, the Focke-Wulf Ta 400, a redesign of the unfinalized and unbuilt Heinkel He 277 design (itself only receiving its RLM airframe number by the February 1943 timeframe in order to give Heinkel an entry in the Amerikabomber program later in 1943), and a design study for a six-engine Messerschmitt Me 264B. The need for six engines was prompted by the ongoing inability of Germany's aviation powerplant designers to create reliable powerplants of 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) and above power output levels, thwarting efforts to do the same with just four engines instead. As the Junkers Ju 390 could use components already in use for the Ju 290 this design was chosen. The Me 264 was not abandoned, however, as the Kriegsmarine (German navy) separately demanded a long-range maritime patrol and attack aircraft to replace the converted Fw 200 Condor in this role.Smith and Kay 1972, p. 550. This was reinforced by an opinion given by then- Generalmajor Eccard Freiherr von Gablenz of the Wehrmacht Heer (German Army) in May 1942, who had been recruited by Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch to give his opinion on the suitability of the Me 264 for the Amerikabomber mission; von Gablenz echoed the Kriegsmarine's later opinion. As a result, the two pending prototypes were ordered to be completed as development prototypes for the Me 264A ultra long-range reconnaissance aircraft.Green 1970, p. 641. Design The Me 264 was an all-metal, high-wing, four-engine heavy bomber of classic construction. The fuselage was round in cross-section and had a cabin in a glazed nose, comprising a \\"stepless cockpit\\" with no separate windscreen section for the pilots, which was common for most later German bomber designs. A strikingly similar design was used for the B-29, of slightly earlier origin. The wing had a slightly swept leading edge and a straight trailing edge. The empennage had double tail fins. The undercarriage was a retractable tricycle gear with large-diameter wheels on the wing-mounted main gear. The planned armament consisted of guns in remotely operated turrets and in positions on the sides of the fuselage. Overall, it carried very little armour and few guns as a means of increasing fuel capacity and range. The Me 264's first prototype was originally fitted with four Junkers Jumo 211 inverted V12 engines using the then-new Kraftei (or \\"power-egg\\") unitized powerplant installation as standardized for the earlier Ju 88A Schnellbomber, but inadequate power from the Jumo 211 engines led to their replacement on the Me 264 V1 first prototype with four similarly unitized 1,700 PS (1,250 kW) BMW 801G engines. In order to provide comfort on the proposed long-range missions, the Me 264 featured bunk beds and a small galley complete with hot plates. Operational history Me 264 V1 undergoing flight-testing. The first prototype, the Me 264 V1, bearing the Stammkennzeichen factory code of RE+EN, was flown on 23 December 1942. It was powered at first by four Jumo 211J inline engines of 990 kW (1,340 hp) each. In late 1943, these were changed to the BMW 801G radials which delivered 1,290 kW (1,750 hp). Trials showed numerous minor faults and handling was found to be difficult. One of the drawbacks was the very high wing loading of the Me 264 in fully loaded conditions at some . Comparable aircraft, such as the Boeing B-29 Superfortress with a wing loading of , the redesigned He 277 at and the Ju 390 at had lower wing loadings. The relatively high wing loading caused poor climb performance, loss of manoeuvrability, stability and high take-off and landing speeds. The first prototype was not fitted with weapons or armour but the following two prototypes, the Me 264 V2 and V3 had armour for the engines, crew and gun positions. The Me 264 V2 was built without defensive armament and vital equipment and the Me 264 V3 was to be armed and have the same armour. In 1943, the Kriegsmarine withdrew their interest in the Me 264 in favour of the Ju 290 and the planned Ju 390. The Luftwaffe indicated preference for the unbuilt Ta 400 and the Heinkel He 277 as Amerikabomber candidates in May 1943, based on their performance estimates. Further payments for development work to Messerschmitt AG for its design were stopped.Griehl & Dressel 1998, p.187 Late in 1943, the second prototype, Me 264 V2, was destroyed in a bombing attack.Smith and Kay 1972, p. 552. On 18 July 1944, the first prototype, which had entered service with Transportstaffel 5, was damaged during an Allied bombing raid and was not repaired. The third prototype, which was unfinished, was destroyed during the same raid. In October 1943, Erhard Milch stopped further Me 264 development, to concentrate on the development and production of the Me 262 jet fighter-bomber. Following the cancellation of the competing He 277 in April 1944, on 23 September 1944, work on the Me 264 project was officially cancelled. Messerschmitt proposed a six-engine version of the Me 264, the Me 264/6m (or alternately Me 364), but it was never built.http://www.luft46.com/prototyp/me264.html Specifications (Me 264 V3)See alsoReferences=NotesBibliography * Duffy, James P.

Ruyi Jingu Bang (), or simply Ruyi Bang or Jingu Bang, is the poetic name of a magical staff wielded by the immortal monkey Sun Wukong in the 16th-century classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Anthony Yu translates the name simply as \\"The Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod\\",Wu, Cheng'en, and Anthony C. Yu. The Journey to the West (Vol. 1). Chicago, Ill: University of Chicago Press, 2012, p. 104 while W.J.F. Jenner translates it as the \\"As-You-Will Gold-Banded Cudgel\\".Wu, Cheng'en, and W.J.F. Jenner. Journey to the West (Vol. 1). [S.l.]: Foreign Languages Press, 2001, p. 56. Origin and general description The staff first appears in the third chapter when the Monkey King goes to the underwater kingdom of Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the East Sea, looking for a magic weapon to match his strength and skill. When all of the traditional magic weapons‚Äîswords, spears, and halberds weighing thousands of pounds each‚Äîfail to meet his standards, the dragon queen suggests to her husband that they give Sun a useless iron pillar taking up space in their treasury. She claims that the ancient shaft had started producing heavenly light days prior and suggests that the monkey is fated to own it. The novel never explains how the pillar was made, only that it was originally used by Yu the Great to measure the depths of the world flood during times immemorial.The less accurate W.J.F. Jenner translation says the pillar was used to fix the milky way in place (Wu and Jenner, Journey to the West (Vol. 1), p. 55). The staff is initially described as a pillar of black iron twenty feet in height and the width of a barrel. It is only when Monkey lifts it and suggests that a smaller size would be more manageable that the staff complies with his wishes and shrinks. After this, it is only a little taller than him, and as thick as a rice bowl. This is when Sun sees that the weapon is banded with a gold ring on each end, as well as the inscription along the body reading \\"The Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod. Weight: thirteen thousand five hundred [catties]\\" (Â¶ÇÊÑèÈáëÁÆçÊ£íÈáç‰∏ÄËê¨‰∏âÂçÉ‰∫îÁôæÊñ§).Anthony Yu's original translation uses the word \\"pounds\\" (Wu and Yu, Journey to the West (Vol. 1), 104). However, Chinese versions of the novel use jin (Êñ§). Jin and pound are two different measures of weight, the former being heavier than the latter. Therefore, the English text has been altered to show this. The inscription indicates that the staff follows the commands of its owner, shrinking or growing to his whim, make copies of itself, and that it is immensely heavy, weighing 17,550 lbs (7,960 kg).The jin during the Ming Dynasty when the novel was compiled equaled 590 grams (Elvin, Mark. The Retreat of the Elephants: An Environmental History of China. New Haven (Conn.): Yale university press, 2004, p. 491 n. 133). When not in use, Monkey shrinks it down to the size of a needle and keeps it tucked behind his ear. Literary predecessor The oldest edition of Journey to the West, the 13th- century K≈çzanji Version (È´òÂ±±ÂØ∫) published during the late Song Dynasty,This edition is named after the Japanese temple in which housed a 17th-century document mentioning the work (Mair, Victor H. The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1994, p. 1181). diverges in many points from the final version published during the Ming. For instance, the episode where Monkey acquires the staff is completely different, as is the staff itself. Sun takes the monk Tang Sanzang to heaven to meet the supreme god Mahabrahma Deva. After the monk impresses the gods with his lecture on the Lotus Sutra, Monkey is given a golden monk's staff (among other items) as a magical weapon against the evils they will face on their journey to India. Sun later uses the staff in a battle with a white-clad woman who transforms into a tiger demon. He changes the staff into a titanic red-haired, blue-skinned Yaksha with a club, showing that the predecessor of the Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod has more magical abilities.Dudbridge, Glen. The Hsi-Yu Chi: A Study of Antecedents to the Sixteenth-Century Chinese Novel. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1970. A weapon that predates the Compliant Rod from the Ming version is mentioned in passing early on in the tale. Monkey mentions that the Queen Mother of the West had flogged him with an \\"Iron Cudgel\\" (ÈìÅÊ£í) on his left and right sides for stealing 10 peaches from her heavenly garden. He later borrows the cudgel to use in tandem with the monk's staff to battle 9 dragons. The rings on the latter may have influenced the bands on the former. In popular culture * The staff influenced the weapon used by Son Goku (himself based on Sun Wukong),West, Mark I. The Japanification of Children's Popular Culture: From Godzilla to Miyazaki. Lanham: Scarecrow Press, 2009, p. 203. the main character of the Dragon Ball franchise. It is named \\"Nyoi Bo,\\" the Japanese transliteration of Ruyi Bang (), and is commonly called \\"Power Pole\\" in English-language media.Camp, Brian, and Julie Davis. Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces. Berkeley, Calif: Stone Bridge Press, 2007, p. 112. Like its original counterpart, the Nyoi Bo can grow to tall lengths, which Goku uses to his advantage for mobility and combat. However, he cannot duplicate it. The staff is given to him as a child by his adoptive grandfather Son Gohan, a human who takes him in and teaches him martial arts.Toriyama, Akira, and Gerard Jones. Dragon Ball (Vol. 2).

Lower Manhattan is defined most commonly as the area delineated on the north by 14th Street, on the west by the Hudson River, on the east by the East River, and on the south by New York Harbor (also known as Upper New York Bay). The Lower Manhattan business district, known as the Financial District, forms the core of the area below Chambers Street. The city had itself originated at the southern tip of Manhattan Island in 1624, at a point that now constitutes the present-day Financial District. The population of the Financial District alone has grown to an estimated 61,000 residents as of 2018, up from 43,000 as of 2014, which in turn was nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census. Geography The pre-9/11 Lower Manhattan skyline in May 2001, seen from the Empire State Building Lower Manhattan is defined most commonly as the area delineated on the north by 14th Street, on the west by the Hudson River, on the east by the East River, and on the south by New York Harbor (also known as Upper New York Bay). When referring specifically to the Lower Manhattan business district and its immediate environs, the northern border is commonly designated by thoroughfares about a mile-and-a-half south of 14th Street and a mile north of the island's southern tip: approximately around Chambers Street from near the Hudson east to the Brooklyn Bridge entrances and overpass. Two other major arteries are also sometimes identified as the northern border of \\"Lower\\" or \\"Downtown Manhattan\\": Canal Street, roughly half a mile north of Chambers Street, and 23rd Street, roughly half a mile north of 14th Street. The Lower Manhattan business district forms the core of the area below Chambers Street. It includes the Financial District (often referred to as Wall Street, after its primary artery) and the World Trade Center site. At the island's southern tip is Battery Park; City Hall is just to the north of the Financial District. Also south of Chambers Street are the planned community of Battery Park City and the South Street Seaport historic area. The neighborhood of TriBeCa straddles Chambers Street on the west side; at the street's east end is the giant Manhattan Municipal Building. North of Chambers Street and the Brooklyn Bridge and south of Canal Street lies most of New York's oldest Chinatown neighborhood. Many court buildings and other government offices are also located in this area. The Lower East Side neighborhood straddles Canal Street. North of Canal Street and south of 14th Street are the neighborhoods of SoHo, the Meatpacking District, the West Village, Greenwich Village, Little Italy, Nolita, and the East Village. Between 14th and 23rd streets are lower Chelsea, Union Square, the Flatiron District, as well as Gramercy, with the large residential development known as Peter Cooper Village‚ÄîStuyvesant Town situated on the eastern flank of this zone. History New Amsterdam, centered in the eventual Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it \\"New York\\". The Cooper Union at Astor Place, where Abraham Lincoln gave his famed Cooper Union speech, is one of the area's most storied buildings. Lower Manhattan pictured in 1931 Lenape and New Netherland Peter Stuyvesant The area that would eventually encompass modern-day New York City was inhabited by the Lenape people. These groups of culturally and linguistically identical Native Americans traditionally spoke an Algonquian language now referred to as Unami. European settlement began with the founding of a Dutch fur trading post in Lower Manhattan, later called New Amsterdam () in 1626. The first fort was built at The Battery to protect New Netherland. Soon thereafter, most likely in 1626, construction of Fort Amsterdam began. Later, the Dutch West Indies Company imported African slaves to serve as laborers; they helped to build the wall that defended the town against English and native attacks. Early directors included Willem Verhulst and Peter Minuit. Willem Kieft became a director in 1638 but five years later was embroiled in Kieft's War against the Native Americans. The Pavonia Massacre, across the Hudson River in present-day Jersey City resulted in the death of 80 natives in February 1643. Following the massacre, Algonquian tribes joined forces and nearly defeated the Dutch. The Dutch Republic sent additional forces to the aid of Kieft, leading to the overwhelming defeat of the Native Americans and a peace treaty on August 29, 1645. On May 27, 1647, Peter Stuyvesant was inaugurated as director general upon his arrival. The colony was granted self- government in 1652, and New Amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on February 2, 1653. The first mayors (burgemeesters) of New Amsterdam, Arent van Hattem and Martin Cregier, were appointed in that year.Scheltema, Gajus and Westerhuijs, Heleen (eds.),Exploring Historic Dutch New York. Museum of the City of New York/Dover Publications, New York 2011. 17th and 18th centuries In 1664, the English conquered the area and renamed it \\"New York\\" after the Duke of York and the city of York in Yorkshire. At that time, people of African descent made up 20% of the population of the city, with European settlers numbering approximately 1,500, and people of African descent numbering 375 (with 300 of that 375 enslaved and 75 free). While it has been claimed that African slaves comprised 40% of the small population of the city at that time,Spencer P.M. Harrington, \\"Bones and Bureaucrats\\", Archeology, March/April 1993, accessed February 11, 2012. this claim has not been substantiated. During the mid 1600s, farms of free blacks covered where Washington Square Park later developed. The Dutch briefly regained the city in 1673, renaming the city \\"New Orange\\", before permanently ceding the colony of New Netherland to the English for what is now Suriname in November 1674. The new English rulers of the formerly Dutch New Amsterdam and New Netherland renamed the settlement back to New York. As the colony grew and prospered, sentiment also grew for greater autonomy. In the context of the Glorious Revolution in England, Jacob Leisler led Leisler's Rebellion and effectively controlled the city and surrounding areas from 1689‚Äì1691, before being arrested and executed. By 1700, the Lenape population of New York had diminished to 200.\\"Gotham Center for New York City History\\" Timeline 1700‚Äì1800. By 1703, 42% of households in New York had slaves, a higher percentage than in Philadelphia or Boston. The 1735 libel trial of John Peter Zenger in the city was a seminal influence on freedom of the press in North America. It would be a standard for the basic articles of freedom in the United States Declaration of Independence. View of New York harbor, ca. 1770 By the 1740s, with expansion of settlers, 20% of the population of New York were slaves, totaling about 2,500 people. After a series of fires in 1741, the city became panicked that blacks planned to burn the city in a conspiracy with some poor whites. Historians believe their alarm was mostly fabrication and fear, but officials rounded up 31 blacks and 4 whites, all of whom were convicted of arson and executed. City officials executed 13 blacks by burning them alive and hanged 4 whites and 18 blacks. In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by George II of Great Britain as King's College in Lower Manhattan. The Stamp Act and other British measures fomented dissent, particularly among the Sons of Liberty, who maintained a long-running skirmish with locally stationed British troops over Liberty Poles from 1766 to 1776. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York City in 1765 in the first organized resistance to British authority across the colonies. After the major defeat of the Continental Army in the Battle of Long Island, General George Washington withdrew to Manhattan Island, but with the subsequent defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington the island was effectively left to the British. The city became a haven for loyalist refugees, becoming a British stronghold for the entire war. Consequently, the area also became the focal point for Washington's espionage and intelligence-gathering throughout the war. In 1771, Bear Market was established along the Hudson River shoreline on land donated by Trinity Church, and replaced by Washington Market in 1813. New York City was greatly damaged twice by fires of suspicious origin during British military rule. The city became the political and military center of operations for the British in North America for the remainder of the war and a haven for Loyalist refugees. Continental Army officer Nathan Hale was hanged in Manhattan for espionage. In addition, the British began to hold the majority of captured American prisoners of war aboard prison ships in Wallabout Bay, across the East River in Brooklyn. More Americans lost their lives from neglect aboard these ships than died in all the battles of the war. British occupation lasted until November 25, 1783. George Washington triumphantly returned to the city that day, as the last British forces left the city. Starting in 1785, the Congress met in New York City under the Articles of Confederation. In 1789, New York City became the first national capital of the United States under the new United States Constitution. The Constitution also created the current Congress of the United States, and its first sitting was at Federal Hall on Wall Street. The first United States Supreme Court sat there. The United States Bill of Rights was drafted and ratified there. George Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall. New York City remained the capital of the U.S. until 1790, when the role was transferred to Philadelphia. 19th century Norman Friend. Sidney's Map Twelve Miles Around New York, 1849. Chromo lithograph, Brooklyn Museum New York grew as an economic center, first as a result of Alexander Hamilton's policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury and, later, with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the North American interior.Lankevich (1998), pp. 67‚Äì68. Immigration resumed after being slowed by wars in Europe, and a new street grid system, the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, expanded to encompass all of Manhattan. Early in the 19th century, the landfill was used to expand Lower Manhattan from the natural Hudson shoreline at Greenwich Street to West Street. In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then an independent city), Manhattan and outlying areas.The 100 Year Anniversary of the Consolidation of the 5 Boroughs into New York City, New York City. Retrieved June 29, 2007. The borough of Brooklyn incorporated the independent City of Brooklyn, recently joined to Manhattan by the Brooklyn Bridge in Lower Manhattan. Municipal governments contained within the boroughs were abolished, and the county governmental functions, housed in Lower Manhattan after unification, were absorbed by the City or each borough. \\"[B]orough presidents ... responsible for local administration and public works.\\" 20th century View from the Woolworth Building in 1913 View from an airplane in 1981 Washington Market was located between Barclay and Hubert Streets, and from Greenwich Street to West Street. It was demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a new Independence Plaza, Washington Market Park and other developments. Lower Manhattan retains one of the most irregular street grid plans in the borough. Throughout the early decades of the 1900s, the area experienced a construction boom, with major towers such as 40 Wall Street, the American International Building, Woolworth Building, and 20 Exchange Place being erected. On March 25, 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village took the lives of 146 garment workers, which would eventually lead to great advancements in the city's fire department, building codes, and workplace regulations. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication. Interborough Rapid Transit (the first New York City Subway company) began operating in 1904. The area's demographics stabilized, labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to the working class, the city's government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under Fiorello La Guardia, and his controversial parks commissioner, Robert Moses, ended the blight of many tenement areas, expanded new parks, remade streets, and restricted and reorganized zoning controls, especially in Lower Manhattan. In the 1950s, a few new buildings were constructed in Lower Manhattan, including an 11-story building at 156 William Street in 1955. A 27-story office building at 20 Broad Street, a 12-story building at 80 Pine Street, a 26-story building at 123 William Street, and a few others were built in 1957. By the end of the decade, Lower Manhattan had become economically depressed, in comparison with Midtown Manhattan, which was booming. David Rockefeller spearheaded widespread urban renewal efforts in Lower Manhattan, beginning with constructing One Chase Manhattan Plaza, the new headquarters for his bank. He established the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association (DLMA) which drew up plans for broader revitalization of Lower Manhattan, with the development of a world trade center at the heart of these plans. The original DLMA plans called for the \\"world trade center\\" to be built along the East River, between Old Slip and Fulton Street. After negotiations with New Jersey Governor Richard J. Hughes, the Port Authority decided to build the World Trade Center on a site along the Hudson River and the West Side Highway, rather than the East River site. When building the World Trade Center, 1.2 million cubic yards (917,000 m3) of material was excavated from the site. Rather than dumping the spoil at sea or in landfills, the fill material was used to expand the Manhattan shoreline across West Street, creating Battery Park City. The result was a 700-foot (210-m) extension into the river, running six blocks or , covering , providing a riverfront esplanade and over of parks.ASLA 2003 The Landmark Award, American Society of Landscape Architects. Accessed May 17, 2007. Through much of its history, the area south of Chambers Street was mainly a commercial district, with a small population of residents‚Äîin 1960, it was home to about 4,000. Construction of Battery Park City, on landfill from construction of the World Trade Center, brought many new residents to the area. Gateway Plaza, the first Battery Park City development, was finished in 1983. The project's centerpiece, the World Financial Center, consists of four luxury highrise towers. By the turn of the century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street. Around this time, Lower Manhattan reached its highest population of business tenants and full-time residents. In 1993, the Downtown Lower Manhattan Association (D-LMA), led by Robert Douglass, contributed to a city Planning Department plan calling for the revitalization of Lower Manhattan. The plan included recommended zoning changes, tax incentives to encourage new tenants and the conversion of commercial buildings into apartments. It also called for the creation of a ‚Äúbusiness improvement district‚Äù, The Alliance for Downtown New York, to help spur the area's renewal. Between 1995 and 2014, 15.8 million square feet of office space has been converted to residential or hotel use. As a result, Lower Manhattan's residential population rose from 14,000 to 60,000.

The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights. Since the early twentieth century, Lower Manhattan has been an important center for the arts and leisure activities. Greenwich Village was a locus of bohemian culture from the first decade of the century through the 1980s. Several of the city's leading jazz clubs are still located in Greenwich Village, which was also one of the primary bases of the American folk music revival of the 1960s. Many art galleries were located in SoHo between the 1970s and early 1990s; today, the downtown Manhattan gallery scene is centered in Chelsea. From the 1960s onward, Lower Manhattan has been home to many alternative theater companies, constituting the heart of the Off-Off-Broadway community. Punk rock and its derivatives emerged in the mid-1970s largely at two venues: CBGB on the Bowery, the western edge of the East Village, and Max's Kansas City on Park Avenue South. At the same time, the area's surfeit of reappropriated industrial lofts played an integral role in the development and sustenance of the minimalist composition, free jazz, and disco/electronic dance music subcultures. The area's many nightclubs and bars‚Äîthough mostly shorn of the freewheeling iconoclasm, pioneering spirit, and do-it-yourself mentality that characterized the pre-gentrification era‚Äîstill draw patrons from throughout the city and the surrounding region. In the early twenty-first century, the Meatpacking District, once the sparsely populated province of after-hours BDSM clubs and transgender prostitutes, gained a reputation as New York's trendiest neighborhood. 21st century United Airlines Flight 175 hits the South Tower of the original World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center, and the towers collapsed. The 7 World Trade Center was not struck by a plane but collapsed because of heavy debris falling from the impacts of planes and the collapse of the North Tower. The other buildings of the World Trade Center complex were damaged beyond repair and soon after demolished. The collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage to surrounding buildings and skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan, and resulted in the deaths of 2,606 people, in addition to those on the planes. Many rescue workers and residents of the area also developed several life-threatening illnesses and some have since died. Following September 11, Lower Manhattan lost much of its economy and office space but has since rebounded significantly. Private sector employment reached 233,000 at the end of 2016, the highest levels since the end of 2001. This was largely due to growth and diversification in the local workforce with gains in employment sectors like Technology, Advertising, Media and Information, as well as Hotel, Restaurants, Retailing, and Health care. As of 2016, Lower Manhattan's business district is home to approximately 700 retail stores and 500 bars and restaurants. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has consummated plans to rebuild downtown Manhattan by adding new streets, buildings, and office space. The National September 11 Memorial at the site was opened to the public on September 11, 2011, while the National September 11 Museum was officially inaugurated by President Barack Obama on May 15, 2014. As of the time of its opening in November 2014, the new One World Trade Center, formerly known as the Freedom Tower, is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth-tallest in the world, at ; while other skyscrapers are under construction at the site. The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park, formerly known as Liberty Plaza Park, began in the Financial District on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and spawning the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide. On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy ravaged portions of Lower Manhattan with record-high storm surge from New York Harbor, severe flooding, and high winds, causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of Manhattanites and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems. The storm and its effects have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of Manhattan and the New York City metropolitan region to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future. Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom, well above the overall birth rate in Manhattan, with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001. The Financial District alone has witnessed growth in its population to approximately 43,000 as of 2014, nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census. There are currently 61,000 residents south of Chambers Street and more than 62 percent of the population is between 18 and 44. Lower Manhattan is home to more young professionals than Greenpoint, the East Village, and Downtown Brooklyn and on par with Downtown Jersey City and Williamsburg. In June 2015, The New York Times wrote that Lower Manhattan's dining scene was experiencing a renaissance. Currently, there are 416 casual dining and 129 full-service dining restaurants. The Village Voice, based at 80 Maiden Lane in the Financial District and historically the largest alternative newspaper in the United States, announced in 2017 that it would cease publication of its print edition and convert to a fully digital venture. On October 31, 2017, a man drove a pickup truck into the Hudson River Park's bike path between Houston Street and Chambers Street, killing eight people and injuring at least 15. Most of those who were hit were bicyclists. It was the first deadly terrorist attack in Manhattan since 9/11. Since 2010, a Little Australia has emerged and is growing in the Nolita neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. Historical sites Chinatown, the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere. Before the September 11 attacks, the Twin Towers were iconic of Lower Manhattan's global significance as a financial center. The new office towers built since the attack (including One World Trade Center) have transformed the skyline of Lower Manhattan. The 9/11 Memorial & Museum at the former World Trade Center site has become a popular draw for visitors. The area contains many historical buildings and sites, including Castle Garden, originally the fort Castle Clinton, Bowling Green, the old United States Customs House, now the National Museum of the American Indian, Federal Hall National Memorial, where George Washington was inaugurated as the first U.S. President, Fraunces Tavern, New York City Hall, the Museum of American Finance, the New York Stock Exchange, renovated original mercantile buildings of the South Street Seaport (and a modern tourist building), the Brooklyn Bridge, South Ferry, embarkation point for the Staten Island Ferry, and Trinity Church. Lower Manhattan is home to some of New York City's most spectacular skyscrapers, including the Woolworth Building, 40 Wall Street (also known as the Trump Building), the Standard Oil Building at 26 Broadway, and the American International Building. Among the commercial districts of Lower Manhattan no longer in existence was Radio Row on Cortlandt Street, which was demolished in 1966 to make way for construction of the former World Trade Center. Denotation Union Square, located between 14th and 17th Streets, may be considered a part of either Lower or Midtown Manhattan.

The full phrase Downtown Manhattan may also refer more specifically to the area of Manhattan south of Canal Street. Within business-related contexts, many people use the term Downtown Manhattan to refer only to the Financial District and the corporate offices in the immediate vicinity. For instance, the Business Improvement District managed by the Alliance for Downtown New York defines Downtown as south of Murray Street (essentially South of New York City Hall), which includes the World Trade Center area and the Financial District. The phrase Lower Manhattan may apply to any of these definitions: the broader ones often if the speaker is discussing the area in relation to the rest of the city; more restrictive ones, again, if the focus is on business matters or on the colonial and early post-colonial history of the island.

Their name derives from their initial isolation from human adenoids in 1953. They have a broad range of vertebrate hosts; in humans, more than 50 distinct adenoviral serotypes have been found to cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections in young children (known as the common cold) to life-threatening multi-organ disease in people with a weakened immune system. Virology= Classification  This family contains the following genera: * Genus Atadenovirus; type species: Ovine atadenovirus D * Genus Aviadenovirus; type species: Fowl aviadenovirus A * Genus Ichtadenovirus; type species: Sturgeon ichtadenovirus A * Genus Mastadenovirus (including all human adenoviruses); type species: Human mastadenovirus C * Genus Siadenovirus; type species: Frog siadenovirus A  Diversity  Classification of Adenoviridae can be complex. In humans, there are 57 accepted human adenovirus types (HAdV-1 to 57) in seven species (Human adenovirus A to G): * A: 12, 18, 31 * B: 3, 7, 11, 14, 16, 21, 34, 35, 50, 55 * C: 1, 2, 5, 6, 57 * D: 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 56 * E: 4 * F: 40, 41 * G: 52 Different types/serotypes are associated with different conditions: * respiratory disease (mainly species HAdV-B and C) * conjunctivitis (HAdV-B and D) * gastroenteritis (HAdV-F types 40, 41, HAdV-G type 52) * obesity or adipogenesis (HAdV-A type 31, HAdV-C type 5, HAdV-D types 9, 36, 37) When not restricting the subject to human viruses, Adenoviridae can be divided into five genera: Mastadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Atadenovirus, Siadenovirus, and Ichtadenovirus.  Structure  Adenoviruses represent the largest known nonenveloped viruses. They are able to be transported through the endosome (i.e., envelope fusion is not necessary). The virion also has a unique \\"spike\\" or fiber associated with each penton base of the capsid (see picture below) that aids in attachment to the host cell via the receptor on the surface of the host cell. (See Replication Section below for discussion of diverse receptors.) In 2010, scientists announced that they had solved the structure of the human adenovirus at the atomic level, making the largest high- resolution model ever. The virus is composed of around 1 million amino acid residues and weighs around 150 MDa.Scientists Unveil Structure of Adenovirus, the Largest High-Resolution Complex Ever Found Science Daily website, retrieved August 30, 2010  Genome  Schematic diagram of the linear adenovirus genome, showing Early genes (E) and Late genes (L). The adenovirus genome is linear, non-segmented double-stranded (ds) DNA that is between 26 and 48 Kbp. This allows the virus to theoretically carry 22 to 40 genes. Although this is significantly larger than other viruses in its Baltimore group, it is still a very simple virus and is heavily reliant on the host cell for survival and replication. An interesting feature of this viral genome is that it has a terminal 55 kDa protein associated with each of the 5' ends of the linear dsDNA. These are used as primers in viral replication and ensure that the ends of the virus' linear genome are adequately replicated.  Replication  Adenoviruses possess a linear dsDNA genome and are able to replicate in the nucleus of vertebrate cells using the host's replication machinery. thumb250pxrightThe structure of adenovirus. 1 = penton capsomeres 2 = hexon capsomeres, and 3= viral genome (linear dsDNA) Entry of adenoviruses into the host cell involves two sets of interactions between the virus and the host cell. Most of the action occurs at the vertices. Entry into the host cell is initiated by the knob domain of the fiber protein binding to the cell receptor. The two currently established receptors are: CD46 for the group B human adenovirus serotypes and the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) for all other serotypes. There are some reports suggesting MHC molecules and sialic acid residues functioning in this capacity as well. This is followed by a secondary interaction, where a motif in the penton base protein (see capsomere) interacts with an integrin molecule. It is the co-receptor interaction that stimulates entry of the adenovirus. This co-receptor molecule is Œ±v integrin. Binding to Œ±v integrin results in endocytosis of the virus particle via clathrin-coated pits. Attachment to Œ±v integrin stimulates cell signaling and thus induces actin polymerization resulting in entry of the virion into the host cell within an endosome. Once the virus has successfully gained entry into the host cell, the endosome acidifies, which alters virus topology by causing capsid components to disband. The capsid is destabilized and protein VI is released from the capsid. These changes, as well as the toxic nature of the pentons, destroy the endosome, resulting in the movement of the virion into the cytoplasm. With the help of cellular microtubules, the virus is transported to the nuclear pore complex, whereby the adenovirus particle disassembles. Viral DNA is subsequently released, which can enter the nucleus via the nuclear pore. After this the DNA associates with histone molecules. Thus, viral gene expression can occur and new virus particles can be generated. The adenovirus life cycle is separated by the DNA replication process into two phases: an early and a late phase. In both phases, a primary transcript that is alternatively spliced to generate monocistronic mRNAs compatible with the host's ribosome is generated, allowing for the products to be translated. The early genes are responsible for expressing mainly non- structural, regulatory proteins. The goal of these proteins is threefold: to alter the expression of host proteins that are necessary for DNA synthesis; to activate other virus genes (such as the virus-encoded DNA polymerase); and to avoid premature death of the infected cell by the host-immune defenses (blockage of apoptosis, blockage of interferon activity, and blockage of MHC class I translocation and expression). Some adenoviruses under specialized conditions can transform cells using their early gene products. E1A (binds Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein) has been found to immortalize primary cells in vitro allowing E1B (binds p53 tumor suppressor) to assist and stably transform the cells. Nevertheless, they are reliant upon each other to successfully transform the host cell and form tumors. DNA replication separates the early and late phases. Once the early genes have liberated adequate virus proteins, replication machinery, and replication substrates, replication of the adenovirus genome can occur. A terminal protein that is covalently bound to the 5‚Äô end of the adenovirus genome acts as a primer for replication. The viral DNA polymerase then uses a strand displacement mechanism, as opposed to the conventional Okazaki fragments used in mammalian DNA replication, to replicate the genome. The late phase of the adenovirus lifecycle is focused on producing sufficient quantities of structural protein to pack all the genetic material produced by DNA replication. Once the viral components have successfully been replicated, the virus is assembled into its protein shells and released from the cell as a result of virally induced cell lysis. Multiplicity reactivation Adenovirus is capable of multiplicity reactivation (MR) (Yamamoto and Shimojo, 1971). MR is the process by which two, or more, virus genomes containing lethal damage interact within the infected cell to form a viable virus genome. Such MR was demonstrated for adenovirus 12 after virions were irradiated with UV light and allowed to undergo multiple infection of host cells. In a review, numerous examples of MR in different viruses were described, and it was suggested that MR is a common form of sexual interaction that provides the survival advantage of recombinational repair of genome damages.  Epidemiology = Transmission  Adenoviruses are unusually stable to chemical or physical agents and adverse pH conditions, allowing for prolonged survival outside of the body and water. Adenoviruses are spread primarily via respiratory droplets, however they can also be spread by fecal routes. Research into the molecular mechanisms underlying adenoviral transmission provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that cellular receptors for adenovirus and coxsackievirus (CARs) are needed to transport adenoviruses into certain naive/progenitor cell types.Wan et al. and DeGregori. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Dec 5;97(25):13784-9  Humans  Humans infected with adenoviruses display a wide range of responses, from no symptoms at all to the severe infections typical of Adenovirus serotype 14.  Animals  Bat adenovirus TJM (Bt-AdV-TJM) is a novel species of the Mastadenovirus genus isolated from Myotis and Scotophilus kuhlii in China. It is most closely related to the tree shrew and canine AdVs. Two types of canine adenoviruses are well known, type 1 and 2. Type 1 (CAdV-1) causes infectious canine hepatitis, a potentially fatal disease involving vasculitis and hepatitis. Type 1 infection can also cause respiratory and eye infections. CAdV-1 also affects foxes (Vulpes vulpes and Vulpes lagopus) and may cause hepatitis and encephalitis. Canine adenovirus 2 (CAdV-2) is one of the potential causes of kennel cough. Core vaccines for dogs include attenuated live CAdV-2, which produces immunity to CAdV-1 and CAdV-2. CAdV-1 was initially used in a vaccine for dogs, but corneal edema was a common complication. Squirrel adenovirus (SqAdV) is reported to cause enteritis in red squirrels in Europe, while gray squirrels seem to be resistant. SqAdV is most closely related to the adenovirus of guinea pigs (GpAdV). Adenovirus in reptiles is poorly understood, but research is currently in progress. Adenoviruses are also known to cause respiratory infections in horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats. Equine adenovirus 1 can also cause fatal disease in immunocompromised Arabian foals, involving pneumonia and destruction of pancreatic and salivary gland tissue. Tupaia adenovirus (TAV) (tree shrew adenovirus 1) has been isolated from tree shrews. Otarine adenovirus 1 has been isolated from sea lions (Zalophus californianus). The fowl adenoviruses are associated with many disease conditions in domestic fowl like Inclusion body hepatitis, Hydropericardium syndrome, Egg drop syndrome, Quail bronchitis, Gizzard erosions and many respiratory conditions. They have also been isolated from wild Black Kites (Milvus migrans). Titi monkey adenovirus was isolated from a colony of monkeys.  Prevention  Currently, there is a vaccine for adenovirus type 4 and 7 for military personnel only. Military personnel are the recipients of this vaccine because they may be at a higher risk of infection. The vaccine contains a live virus, which may be shed in stool and lead to transmission. There is currently no adenovirus vaccine for the general public. The vaccine is not approved for use outside of the military, as it has not been tested in studied in the general population or on people with weakened immune systems. In the past, US military recruits were vaccinated against two serotypes of adenovirus, with a corresponding decrease in illnesses caused by those serotypes. That vaccine is no longer manufactured. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command announced on 31 October 2011 that a new adenovirus vaccine, which replaces the older version that has been out of production for over a decade, was shipped to basic training sites Oct. 18, 2011. More information is available here. Prevention of adenovirus, as well as other respiratory illnesses, involves frequent hand washing for more than 20 seconds, avoiding touching the eyes, face, and nose with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with people with symptomatic adenovirus infection. Those with symptomatic adenovirus infection are additionally advised to cough or sneeze into the arm or elbow instead of the hand, to avoid sharing cups and eating utensils, and to refrain from kissing others. Chlorination of swimming pools can prevent outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is from symptoms and history. Tests are only necessary in very serious cases. Tests include blood tests, eyes, nose or throat swabs, stool sample tests, and chest x-rays. In the laboratory, adenovirus can be identified with antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation and serology. Even if adenovirus is found to be present, it may not be the cause of any symptoms. Some immunocompromised individuals can shed the virus for weeks and show no symptoms.  Infections  Most infections with adenovirus result in infections of the upper respiratory tract. Adenovirus infections often show up as conjunctivitis, tonsillitis (which may look exactly like strep throat and cannot be distinguished from strep except by throat culture), an ear infection, or croup. Adenoviruses, types 40 and 41 can also cause gastroenteritis. A combination of conjunctivitis and tonsillitis is particularly common with adenovirus infections. Some children (especially small ones) can develop adenovirus bronchiolitis or pneumonia, both of which can be severe. In babies, adenoviruses can also cause coughing fits that look almost exactly like whooping cough. Adenoviruses can also cause viral meningitis or encephalitis. Rarely, adenovirus can cause hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder‚Äîa form of urinary tract infection‚Äîwith blood in the urine). Most people recover from adenovirus infections by themselves, but people with immunodeficiency sometimes die of adenovirus infections, and‚Äîrarely‚Äîeven previously healthy people can die of these infections. This may be because sometimes adenoviral infection can lead to cardiac disorders. For example, in one study, some cardiac samples of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were positive for presence of adenovirus type 8. Adenoviruses are often transmitted by expectorate, but can also be transmitted by contact with an infected person, or by virus particles left on objects such as towels and faucet handles. Some people with adenovirus gastroenteritis may shed the virus in their stools for months after getting over the symptoms. The virus can be passed through water in swimming pools that do not have enough chlorine in them. As with many other illnesses, good handwashing is one way to inhibit the spread of adenoviruses from one person to another. Heat and bleach will kill adenoviruses on objects.  Treatment  There are no proven antiviral drugs to treat adenoviral infections, so treatment is largely directed at the symptoms (such as acetaminophen for fever). The antiviral drug cidofovir has helped certain of those patients who had severe cases of illness; the number helped and to what degree, and the particular complications or symptoms it helped with, and when and where this happened, were not given in the source. A doctor may give antibiotic eyedrops for conjunctivitis, while awaiting results of bacterial cultures, and to help prevent secondary bacterial infections. Currently, there is no adenovirus vaccine available to the general public, but a vaccine is available for the United States military for Types 4 and 7.  Use in Gene Therapy and Vaccination = Gene Therapy  Adenoviruses have long been a popular viral vector for gene therapy due to their ability to affect both replicating and non-replicating cells, accommodate large transgenes, and code for proteins without integrating into the host cell genome. More specifically, they are used as a vehicle to administer targeted therapy, in the form of recombinant DNA or protein. This therapy has been found especially useful in treating monogenic disease (e.g. cystic fibrosis, X-linked SCID, alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency) and cancer. In China, oncolytic adenovirus is an approved cancer treatment. Specific modifications on fibre proteins are used to target Adenovirus to certain cell types; a major effort is made to limit hepatotoxicity and prevent multiple organ failure. Adenovirus dodecahedron can qualify as a potent delivery platform for foreign antigens to human myeloid dendritic cells (MDC), and that it is efficiently presented by MDC to M1-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes. Adenovirus has been used for delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing systems, but high immune reactivity to viral infection has posed challenges in use for patients. Use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) shows promise in overcoming immunogenicity, though it has a smaller payload capacity.  Vaccines  Modified (recombinant) adenovirus vectors, including replication incompetent types, can deliver DNA coding for specific antigens. Recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) and adenovirus type-26 (Ad26) are being used vectors in candidate COVID-19 vaccines.‚ÄúAn Open Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity of the Drug ‚ÄòGam-COVID-Vac‚Äô Vaccine Against COVID-19 - Full Text View.‚Äù Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov, 22 June 2020, clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04436471?term=vaccine.

In some cases, people have pre-existing immunity to Adenoviruses, making vector delivery ineffective.

Craniopagus parasiticus is an extremely rare type of parasitic twinning occurring in about 2 to 3 of 5,000,000 births. In craniopagus parasiticus, a parasitic twin head with an undeveloped body is attached to the head of a developed twin. Fewer than a dozen cases of this type of conjoined twin have been documented in literature. Development The exact development of craniopagus parasiticus is not well known. However, it is known that the underdeveloped twin is a parasitic twin. Parasitic twins are known to occur in utero when monozygotic twins start to develop as an embryo, but the embryo fails to completely split. When this happens, one embryo will dominate development, while the other's development is severely altered. The key difference between a parasitic twin and conjoined twins is that in parasitic twins, one twin, the parasite, stops development during gestation, whereas the other twin, the autosite, develops completely.Parasitic twin In normal monozygotic twin development, one egg is fertilized by a single sperm. The egg will then completely split into two, normally at the two-cell stage. If the egg splits in the early blastocyst stage, two inner cell masses will be present, eventually leading to the twins sharing the same chorion and placenta, but with separate amnions. However, the egg can split into two, but still have one blastocyst. This will lead to one inner cell mass and one blastocyst. Then, as the twins develop, they will share the same placenta, chorion, and amnion. This is thought to be the most likely reason why conjoined twins occur, and could possibly play a role in the development of craniopagus parasiticus. One hypothesis is that craniopagus parasiticus starts with the development of two fetuses from a single zygote that fail to separate at the head region around the second week of gestation. Some believe, however, that it occurs later in development, around the fourth week of gestation, at which time the two embryos fuse together near the anterior open neuropore. Another hypothesis is that there is joining of the somatic and placental vascular system of the twins, as well as a degeneration of the umbilical cord of the parasitic twin. This suggests that craniopagus parasiticus develops due to the lack of blood supply to one of the twins. Diagnosis=Related conditions In addition to craniopagus parasiticus, a few other conditions involve a child's, or animal's, birth with two heads or faces. =Dicephalic parapagus= Dicephalic parapagus is a condition where two heads are side by side on a single torso, with varying degrees of twinning of organs and structures within the torso. =Diprosopus= Diprosopus occurs when a single body and neck are present, but there is a duplication of the structures of the face. This is different from craniopagus parasiticus in that there is only one head, although there is a duplication of the craniofacial features. Diprosopus can range from having two fully formed faces to just a duplication of the nose or eyes. Cats with the condition are referred to as 'Janus cats'. A cat named Frankenlouie was a famous example noted by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2012 for being the longest surviving Janus cat. Treatment With so few individuals actually surviving until birth, the only treatment option is surgery to try to remove the parasitic twin. Surgery, however, is very dangerous and has been successful only once. The problem with surgical intervention is that the arterial supplies of the head are so intertwined that it is very hard to control the bleeding, but it has been suggested that cutting off the parasitic twin's arterial supply might improve the odds of the developed twin's survival. Prevalence Only ten cases of craniopagus parasiticus have been documented, out of a total of at least eighty known cases of craniopagus in general. Only three cases have been documented by modern medicine to have survived birth: *On December 10, 2003, Rebeca Mart√≠nez was born in the Dominican Republic with this rare condition. She was the first baby born with the condition to undergo an operation to remove the second head. She died on February 7, 2004, after an 11-hour operation. *On February 19, 2005, 10-month-old Manar Maged underwent a successful 13-hour surgery in Egypt. The underdeveloped conjoined twin, Islaam, was attached to Manar's head and was facing upward. Islaam could blink and even smile, but doctors determined she had to be removed, and that she could not survive on her own. Manar was featured on an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show and in the British documentary series Body Shock. Manar died fourteen months after the surgery, just days before her second birthday, due to a severe infection in her brain. *An earlier case was the so-called \\"Two- Headed Boy of Bengal\\", who was born in 1783 and died of a cobra bite in 1787. His skull remains in the collection of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of London. History Only ten cases of craniopagus parasiticus have been reported in the medical research literature. Of those cases, only three have survived birth. The first case on record is that of Everard Home's Two-Headed Boy of Bengal, whose skull is preserved at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal Society of Surgeons. Terminology In the past, the use of terminology when describing parasitic twins has been somewhat inconsistent. By definition, a parasitic twin is joined to another twin in a certain anatomical location or position on the developed twin's body. The underdeveloped twin is termed the parasite, and the developed twin is termed the autosite. The autosite can have some abnormalities, as well. For the most part, however, it has developed enough that it can live on its own.

It was built between 1533 and 1540 to defend the harbor of San Juan. The structure is also known as Palacio de Santa Catalina translative (Santa Catalina's Palace) Is the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the New World. It was listed by UNESCO in 1983 as part of the World Heritage Site \\"La Fortaleza and San Juan National Historic Site\\". During the 1640 reconstruction, the chapel of Santa Catalina, which originally existed outside the walls, was demolished and was integrated to the walls of the structure, resulting in the alternate name Santa Catalina's Castle. The structure Front view of La Fortaleza La Fortaleza was the first defensive fortification built for the city of San Juan, and the first of a series of military structures built to protect the city which included the Fort San Felipe del Morro and the Fort San Crist√≥bal. The construction was authorized by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor as a defense against attacks from Island Caribs and the European powers of the time. Initially, the structure consisted of four walls enclosing an interior patio with a circular tower known as the Homage Tower. From the top of the tower, the governor, following military tradition, would take oaths of fidelity at critical moments to the King and Queen of Spain. Later, a second tower named the Austral Tower was constructed. At present, the complex consists of a few attached buildings with formal living quarters in the second floor, and private quarters in the third. It overlooks the high city walls that front the bay, and within the north perimeter of the house are sheltered gardens and a swimming pool. History Starting in 1529, Governor La Gama petitioned the emperor on the need to build defensive fortifications, \\"because the island's defenseless condition caused the people to emigrate.\\" Construction started in 1533, with the use of stone, and concluded by 1540. Yet the fort had no guns, and Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s commented \\"if it had been constructed by blind men could not have been located in a worse location.\\" Yet the structure has served as the governor's residence since 1544. La Fortaleza on a 1937 U.S. stamp Since the 16th century, La Fortaleza has acted as the residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico, making it the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas. On November 27, 1822, its traditional status as the executive mansion was made official. The fortress underwent a massive reconstruction in 1846 to change its military appearance into a palatial facade. La Fortaleza has been the residence of more than 170 governors of Puerto Rico and has hosted various dignitaries, including President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline Kennedy who stayed in La Fortaleza in 1961. King Juan Carlos of Spain and Queen Juliana of the Netherlands are among several heads of state who have stayed in La Fortaleza. In June 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama visited the mansion during a brief trip to the island marking the first visit of an in-office US President to the Fortaleza as well as the Island on official business since Kennedy, 50 years previously to that date. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain also visited La Fortaleza in 2016. Shop near La Fortaleza, San Juan, Puerto Rico La Fortaleza has been captured twice by invaders: * 1598, George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, attacked San Juan. * 1625, General Boudewijn Hendrick (Balduino Enrico) of the Netherlands invaded the city and established himself at La Fortaleza. During the Dutch retreat, the fortress and the city were set ablaze. In 1834, Colonel George Dawson Flinter described the fortress of Santa Catalina as having a chapel, stables and a cistern as well as an east wing with spacious apartments. According to tradition, in 1898, just before the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the last Spanish governor of the island, Ricardo De Ortega, struck a longcase clock in La Fortaleza with his sword, stopping the clock and marking the time at which Spain lost control over Puerto Rico. On October 30, 1950, there was an attempt by a few nationalists to enter La Fortaleza in what is known as the San Juan Nationalist revolt, intending to attack then-governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. The 5-minute shootout resulted in four Nationalists dead: Domingo Hiraldo Resto, Carlos Hiraldo Resto, Manuel Torres Medina and Ra√≠mundo D√≠az Pacheco. Three of the guards of the building, among them Lorenzo Ramos, were seriously injured. On October 9, 1960, La Fortaleza was designated a United States National Historic Landmark. and In 1983, La Fortaleza, along with the San Juan National Historic Site, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. On May 26, 2004, a man armed with a knife entered the mansion's mailroom located just outside the palace gates and took a receptionist hostage. The 2¬Ω hour stand- off ended after Governor Sila Mar√≠a Calder√≥n entered the building and listened as the hostage-taker read a letter. From July 13 to July 24, 2019, the surrounding streets around La Fortaleza were the scene of various protests as part of Telegramgate as a result of leaked messages involving Governor Ricardo Rossell√≥. As protesters continued to demand the governor to step down on July 24, 2019, Rossell√≥ announced his resignation from office, effective August 2, 2019. In literature In 2011, Puerto Rican author Giannina Braschi wrote the dramatic novel United States of Banana, featuring climactic scenes of revolution at La Fortaleza.

Ipswich was later operated by the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) as HNLMS Morotai, and by the Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL) as KRI Hang Tuah. In Indonesian service in 1958 the ship was attacked by a CIA aircraft and sunk with considerable loss of life. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar- class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti- submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including Ipswich) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Ipswich was laid down by Evans Deakin & Co at Brisbane in Queensland on 6 March 1941. She was launched on 11 August 1941 by Evelyn Foll, wife of the Minister for the Interior Harry Foll, and commissioned on 13 June 1942. Operational history=RAN Ipswich was employed from commissioning until 3 November 1942 as a convoy escort in Australian waters. From 3 November 1942 until 21 January 1945, Ipswich was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet, primarily serving in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, but spending May to October 1943 in the Mediterranean. During this time, Ipswich was credited with shooting down a twin-engined bomber near Syracuse on 25 July 1943, and on 11 February 1944 worked with HMAS Launceston and to sink Japanese submarine Ro-110. Upon leaving the British Eastern Fleet, Ipswich returned to Australia, where she was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet. Ipswich was present in Tokyo Bay on Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. Ipswich earned five battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1942\\", \\"Indian Ocean 1942‚Äì45\\", \\"Sicily 1943\\", \\"East Indies 1944\\", and \\"Okinawa 1945\\". RNLN Ipswich paid off from RAN service on 5 July 1946 and was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy and renamed HNLMS Morotai. TNI- AL Morotai was transferred to the Indonesian Navy in 1949 and renamed KRI Hang Tuah. On 28 April 1958 a Douglas B-26 Invader aircraft, painted black and showing no markings, bombed and sank her off Balikpapan in southern Borneo. 18 crew were killed and another 28 were wounded. The B-26's co-pilot was Colonel Muharto of the Permesta rebel movement's AUREV insurgent air force but the aircraft, its ammunition and pilot were supplied by the CIA as part of an insurgency to destabilise President Sukarno's government. The pilot was William H. Beale, a former United States Army Air Forces lieutenant colonel then employed by a Taiwan-based CIA front organisation, Civil Air Transport.

In the popular imagination, a witch is a woman who, by means of a pact with the Devil, has acquired supernatural power, which she uses for her own benefit and for evil purposes. Today, the general population no longer believes in witches, and many people view the witch only as a well-loved traditional character, appearing only in children's stories. Catalan tradition distinguished between bruixeria (\\"witchcraft\\") based on an explicit compact with the Devil, and fetilleria (deriving from a word related to \\"fetish\\", and Old Portuguese feiti√ßo); magic worked through charms and fetishes. The former was considered inherently evil, the latter might include the working of magical cures. This article is focused on bruixeria. The mark of the devil Witches supposedly have \\"the mark of the devil\\" on their buttocks, made by a forceful bite by the Devil's teeth, which takes the form of two crossed horns, a toad, a ram with large horns, or a simple little circle. Legend also has it that the Devil can mark the witch's eye in various ways: with horns, or by making it empty, or with two pupils. Some traditions say that witches have two pupils in the left eye and deer horns in the right one. (This belief in the mark of the devil goes well beyond Catalonia, although these particular forms are specifically Catalan.) According to Catalan tradition (again, this may not be uniquely Catalan), one can wash marks on the skin with holy water in order to know whether they are the Devil's work: the Devil's mark will not wash off. Witches were also said to have a heart-shaped mark on their left side; for a witch of great abilities, the heart-shaped mark would be hairy. The presence of witches It was said that the whispering of fallen leaves blown about a rooftop was the sound of witches criticizing the behavior of the family of the house. To prevent witches from sowing evil herbs to damage the fields and crops, one would place to the right of the gate a figure of a guardsman, precisely vertical. An old woman who could no longer hear the litany was in danger of being considered a witch for her deafness to the word of God. Power and practices According to one Catalan tradition, a person who wants to become a witch should go to the seashore, undress completely, and roll around on the sand. After giving seven full revolutions, stand and make three circles. By the full moon of October and of January, witches were said to make marks on their buttocks, by means of which they maintain and strengthen their malign powers, which otherwise diminish and cool down by the action of time and age. In October, they were said to pray to the Devil with a rosary that had the cross broken off. Witches were said to fly mounted on forks, poles, and especially brooms; in each case, the flying object was first anointed with an unguent provided by the Devil. It was said that, because in the past witches were always persecuted and garroted with brooms, the Devil had given them this particular power in order to be able to escape. While they fly, they supposedly would repeat, over and over\\"Per ac√≠, per all√†, cap ac√≠, cap all√†\\", (\\"Here, there, hence, thence\\") as if they were in a cavalcade of animals. Witches were said to make unguents or brews from the flesh of the hanged, from live infants, from black flour or grain, in a cauldron big enough to hold seven witches, cooked over a fire lit by the heat from their furious dancing. This was the unguent that enabled them to fly, to turn into whatever species of animal they desire, to prophesy, and to make all manner of evil spells. Witches were said to take the form of cats, in order to more easily enter houses and to enable them to take items of clothing, shoes, needles, and so forth. They supposedly stole in order to be able to bewitch and to do harm; they did not steal money nor valuable objects. Witches were said to be able to see the stars through the roof, to see people naked even through their clothing, and to look inside a person and know what organ is making that person ill. (This last may be related to the traditions of witches as healers.) Witches were said to climb up on top of the clouds, and make it rain or, especially, hail (which was particularly bad for the crops). One could ward this off by making certain signs of the cross or singing certain hymns, so that the devil would have to take the cloud elsewhere. Witches were said to take toads as counsellors and to initiate to the novices. Many traditions about witches related to specific days of the year, especially the eves of certain Christian holidays and saint's days; witches were also said to be very powerful during Lent, which is, in a sense, the eve of Easter. All Saints Day Certain traditional stories related specifically to All Saints Day (November 1). On All Saints Day, witches were said to break the crosses from any graves they pass, destroying all proof of the existence of the buried dead. Another tradition has it that one could destroy a witch by going to her house on November 1, and marking a star on the gate. One would then go to a mass dedicated to Saint Martin. When the witch got home, the star would have burned, and the witch would be slowly consumed, her own witchcraft turned against her. Christmas Eve On Christmas Eve, a witch was said to test the strength of her craft by looking upwards through the roof of her house; if she can't see all the stars, even the smallest, it is a sign that her condition is fading; then she must wait for the first full moon night, especially if it falls on Saint Silvester's Day, to mark her buttocks and restore the power of her witchcraft. It was said that one must not leave a toddler alone in the house on Christmas Eve, because the witches take them. There is a story that a woman of Palau de Vidre went to Midnight Mass and left her infant child at home alone; the witches supposedly took the child outside and left him on top of the garden gate. \\"Guardar un fil filat la nit de Nadal, guarda de les bruixes.\\" (\\"To keep a thread spun on Christmas Eve, will keep you from the witches.\\") New Year's Eve On New Year's Eve, witches were said to have the most power. To maintain that power, a witch was supposed to make seven laps around her house, make certain gestures and sprinkle everything with holy water, blessed leaves from Palm Sunday, or some other blessed object. (Note the remarkable contrast to traditions from elsewhere in Europe, where witches would shy away from any blessed object.) At the stroke of midnight, she would go to dance inside the oven; merely to come near a witch during any of this was said to be particularly dangerous. The witches of Alt Bergued√† and Cad√≠ were said to apply unguents, climb up the chimney and, mounted on brooms, head for Pedraforca to hold a great gathering. The main feature of the gathering was said to be a great circle dance. Similarly, the witches of the Alt Pallars and of the Vall d'Aran were said to meet on the plain of Beret. In Camp de Tarragona, the witches were said to assemble on the peak of Montserrat, where they dance naked in the cold to the sound of a violin played by the Devil. On this night, also, witches were said to carry children away. On New Year's Eve, one should put the children to bed early and make the sign of the cross over them to ward off the evil power. Supposedly, at New Year's, more than any other night of the year, one must take measures against a visit by the witches. One would cover the embers of the fireplace with ashes, and make a cross over them with one or another fire tool, while reciting a formula (the text of which varies a great deal, from place to place within Catalonia). A householder would leave the fire tongs open in the form of a cross over the embers, or leave two fire tools crossed. These crosses were supposed to summon angels to come down and warm themselves by the embers and, by their presence, ward off devils and the witches. An alternative tradition was simply to put salt on the chimney. It also was the custom to wash and sprinkle with holy water all the doors and windows, and above all the keyhole, pushing through it a blessed sprig of laurel or rosemary and reciting a prayer (which, again, has a great number of variants). In the region of Montserrat blessed palm leaves would be placed, crossed on the chimney to stop the witches from coming down it. In Llu√ßan√©s, they would pour out all the water in the house to prevent the witches from being able to bewitch the house by washing it on their visit. The Eve of Saint John Another time of year when witches were specifically to be warded off was the Eve of the Feast of Saint John the Baptist, a night associated with the gathering of herbs: supposedly, herbs gathered on that night were particularly powerful. On this night, witches were also said to take the form of partridges or of flies, and also to fly overhead and pour their poisonous brews onto the heads of those whom they wished to harm. Catalans would light bonfires to scare away the airborne witches. On that night, by the tower of Roquetes, outside Sant Andreu de Palomar the flying embers were said to be witches fleeing the smoke from the bonfires; the flying witches were said to take embers in their hands to try to light the mountain afire, but they would fail because of the virtue that all herbs were said to have on this night. On the peak of Pedraforca, witches were said to gather and to sing: :Alf√†brega i valeriana, :menta i ruda :salven tota criatura :Ruda i valeriana :menta i alf√†brega, :tot ho cura i tot ho salva. :Menta i alf√†brega, :ruda i valeriana :salven tota persona nada. :Ruda i Valeriana, :alf√†brega i s√†lvia :tot el m√≥n salven. : Basil and valerian, : Mint and rue : Save all creation : Rue and valerian, : Mint and basil : Cure all and save all : Mint and basil : Rue and valerian : Save every person born : Rue and valerian : Basil and sage : Save the whole world Their master, a goat, was said to leap and dance in the center of the circle, and to answer as a refrain to each verse: :M√©s val l'orella d'√≥s :que ho cura i salva tot. : The borage leaf is worth more : Which cures and saves all. Unsurprisingly, it was said to be very dangerous to encounter one of these gatherings, but one could tell where the witches had danced by the remnants of rue, basil, valerian, and sage, and by the \\"fairy rings\\" of mushrooms. There is a story from Sant Mart√≠ de Sarroca in Pened√®s, of an old man witnessing the witches' dance, with appropriately dramatic demonic appearances, the ground shaking like an earthquake from their steps, and so forth. The witches of Andorra, of both sexes, were said to dance naked at the lake of Engolasters. (This legend appears to be reflected in the recently revived festival of El Brut i La Bruta, celebrated in the Catalan village of Tor√† in the comarca of Segarra. See external site http://www.brutibruta.com.) They form three concentric circles, and at a certain point in the music, they come together and the bump each other hard, rump to rump, dancing to the music of a demon, or a cavalcade of demons, with wooden flute and drum. Andorran witches also supposedly gathered at the summits of Font Argent and of Fra Miquel. Male and female witches were said to have intercourse with demons of the opposite sex. Before this gathering, Andorran witches were required to fast and to sleep, but they sleep with one eye open, because if they were late for the gathering, the Devil would punish them. Other stories of Catalan witches Naturally, there are many other specific local stories of particular local witches, including one known as the Bruixa Napa del Prats del Llu√ßan√®s (or Bruixa Napa, or Bruixa Prats) who is often depicted accompanied by her daughter. In Arb√∫cies, there is a rhyme that goes: :Arb√∫cies, :dotze dones, dotze bruixes. :Arb√∫cies, :Twelve women, twelve witches. Other stories include a story from Girona that a particular gargoyle is actually a witch turned to stone, or a story from Canig√≥ of witches producing a hailstorm by urinating into a hole and beating the liquid with vines. It may be worth reiterating that Catalans today are no more likely to believe in witches than any other modern people. This article is strictly an attempt to give some specificity to the historic beliefs about witches in one particular region of Europe for which the beliefs are relatively well documented.

Life and career Howard, who grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Bernard and Joy Garson Howard (May 13, 1924 ‚Äì June 5, 2016). His parents were prominent members of Atlanta's Jewish community.https://www.ajc.com/blog/buzz/clark-howard-mom-joy-chase-has- died/2HCLPtlW3Ypk1KAoGc28YL/ He has been a nationally syndicated radio host since 1989, teaching consumers ways to \\"save more, spend less and avoid rip- offs.\\" The Clark Howard Show is heard every day on more than 200 radio stations throughout North America, and airs from News/Talk WSB, WSB AM/WSBB FM in Atlanta. He is a frequent consumer expert guest on other talk, variety and news programs. Clark Howard taking the airwaves with WSB-TV news anchor Justin Farmer to raise awareness and donations for the 24th annual \\"Clark's Christmas Kids\\" campaign in 2014. Howard's first career was in the travel agency business. Howard attended the Westminster Schools in Atlanta before graduating from the American University in 1976 with a BA in Urban Government. He went on to receive his Master of Business Administration degree from Central Michigan University in 1977. In 1987, he retired from the travel agency business he founded in 1981 and began giving travel advice in guest appearances on Atlanta radio. His segments were so popular that he was soon given his own radio show. In 1991, Howard also became a consumer affairs TV reporter for WSB-TV, the local ABC affiliate. In 1993, he founded the Consumer Action Center to have volunteers answer consumer questions off the air. Howard's website followed in 1997, and in 1998 his show went into syndication. Howard explained on air that he was joining the Georgia State Defense Force (an unarmed, non-federal branch of the Georgia Department of Defense) following the September 11 attacks. He attends monthly training workshops around the state as part of his service, and has performed medical evacuation work in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. In 2009, Howard was diagnosed with a \\"little league\\" cancer of the prostate. He made it public on WSB-TV on February 18, 2009. He gave another update three months later on his Web site. In August 2017, Howard escaped serious injury from a car accident. While walking across a parking lot, he spotted a car backing towards him at high speed after hearing a woman screaming. Recalling a story he read in the news, he jumped in the air to lessen the severity of the impact and thus was only grazed by the vehicle, suffering only minor pain in his neck and shoulder, but no cuts or bruises. Media personality From 2012‚Äì13, Howard was co-host of HLN's Evening Express, a daily news and lifestyle roundup that aired 5‚Äì7:00 pm weeknights. Several years earlier, in 2009, Howard hosted a weekend program on HLN. The format was similar to Howard's radio show, in that the host gives advice to callers and provides tips on saving money. In 2012, he became one of several anchors on the daily HLN show \\"Evening Express,\\" which aired from 5-7pm ET. Howard has also appeared elsewhere on HLN such as on Morning Express with Robin Meade. Howard continues to regularly appear on WSB-TV in Atlanta, which is occasionally broadcast by other Cox Television stations nationwide. His TV appearances offer consumer scam warnings and consumer tips. He is syndicated by Westwood One. Although his radio show is supported in part by advertisements, Howard does not do personal product sponsorships or endorsements. This is of note as he often states strongly worded opinions and research, both pro and con, on various consumer issues, companies, and products. He started several civic programs in the community, such as Atlanta Volunteer Action, Volunteer Action, Inc., The Big Buddy Program, and Career Action. With help from his listeners, Howard began teaming up with Habitat for Humanity in 1996 to build houses around the Atlanta area. 2010 marked the 15th-anniversary build and \\"Team Clark\\" completed its 39th house together. In 2013, he built his 50th home for Atlanta Habitat for Humanity. In 2018, Team Clark completed its 75th Habitat home. Website and Consumer Action Center Howard's website, Clark.com, is a commercial website with financial advice provided by Clark as well as others in the field. In 1993, Howard opened the Team Clark Consumer Action Center, a free call-in advice center for consumer questions. Author Howard is the author of several books on consumer tips and bargains. His most recent book: \\"Clark Howard's Living Large for the Long Haul: Consumer-Tested Ways to Overhaul Your Finances, Increase Your Savings, and Get Y our Life Back on Track\\" https://clark.com/clark-books/ contains over 300 pages of frugal information to help navigate the economics of life in the US.

It is a resident breeder in most of sub-Saharan Africa outside the rainforests, although it has seasonal movements. These are conspicuous and unmistakable birds. They are large brown waders with a black crown, white forehead and large yellow facial wattles. The tail is white, tipped black, and the long legs are yellow. In flight, the upperwings have black flight feathers and brown coverts separated by a white bar. The underwings are white with black flight feathers. The African wattled lapwing has a loud peep-peep call. This species is a common breeder in wet lowland habitats, especially damp grassland. It often feeds in drier habitats, such as golf courses, picking insects and other invertebrates from the ground. It lays three or four eggs on a ground scrape.

Design and construction The J class was designed by the Royal Navy in response to reported German submarines with surface speeds over .Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 86 They had a displacement of 1,210 tons surfaced, and 1,820 tons submerged. Each submarine was in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . The propulsion system was built around three propeller shafts; the J-class were the only triple-screwed submarines ever built by the British. Propulsion came from three 12-cylinder diesel motors when on the surface, and electric motors when submerged. Top speed was on the surface (the fastest submarines in the world at the time of construction), and underwater. Range was at . Armament consisted of six 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes (four forward, one on each beam), plus a 4-inch deck gun. Originally, the gun was mounted on a breastwork fitted forward of the conning tower, but the breastwork was later extended to the bow and merged into the hull for streamlining, and the gun was relocated to a platform fitted to the front of the conning tower. 44 personnel were aboard. J1 was built by HM Dockyard at Portsmouth in Hampshire, and launched on 6 November 1915. Service history J1 operated in patrols in the North Sea. In November 1916, a German force of half a destroyer flotilla, three dreadnoughts, and a battlecruiser set out from port to rescue two submarines and that were stranded in fog off Jutland. On the return, having only rescued one of the submarines, the force passed J1 off Horns Reef on 5 November 1916. Two of the dreadnoughts, and , were torpedoed by J1, earning her commanding officer, Commander N. F. Laurence, a Bar for his Distinguished Service Order. The dreadnoughts did not sink, but reached port and underwent repairs. The submarine was later transferred to Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean. On 9 November 1918, during an engagement with , J1 launched a depth charge from a specially fitted launcher. J1 being refitted at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 1919 After the war, the British Admiralty decided that the best way to protect the Pacific region was with a force of submarines and cruisers. To this end, they offered the six surviving submarines of the J class to the Royal Australian Navy as gifts. J1 and her sisters were commissioned into the RAN in April 1919, and sailed for Australia on 9 April, in the company of the cruisers and , and the tender . The flotilla reached Thursday Island on 29 June, and Sydney on 10 July. Because of the submarines' condition after the long voyage, they were immediately taken out of service for refits. J1 and J4, plus Platypus, sailed on 10 February 1920 for Geelong, where a submarine base was established. Apart from local exercises and a 1921 visit to Tasmania, the submarines saw little use, and by June 1922, the cost of maintaining the boats and deteriorating economic conditions saw the six submarines decommissioned and marked for disposal. Fate The submarine was paid off on 12 July 1922. J1 was sold to the Melbourne Salvage Company on 26 February 1924.

There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary color, and tertiary color. Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490), a tradition of \\"colory theory\\" began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton's theory of color (Opticks, 1704) and the nature of primary colors. From there it developed as an independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to colorimetry and vision science. The purpose of color theory range from renaissance fine art to modern commercial advertising. Colours affect our mood and perception. Color theory is not new but also seen in old traditions. Color was mentioned many times in the ancient bible and every colour has its specific definition and interpretation. Color can be classified according to 1) Warm and Cold 2) Receding and Advancing 3) Positive and negative 4) Subtractive and additive  Color abstractions  Classification of pigment colors The foundations of pre-20th-century color theory were built around \\"pure\\" or ideal colors, characterized by different sensory experiences rather than attributes of the physical world. This has led to a number of inaccuracies in traditional color theory principles that are not always remedied in modern formulations. Another issue has been the tendency to describe color effects holistically or categorically, for example as a contrast between \\"yellow\\" and \\"blue\\" conceived as generic colors, when most color effects are due to contrasts on three relative attributes which define all colors: # Value (light vs. dark, or white vs. black), # Chroma [saturation, purity, strength, intensity] (intense vs. dull), and # Hue (e.g. the name of the color family: red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta). The visual impact of \\"yellow\\" vs. \\"blue\\" hues in visual design depends on the relative lightness and saturation of the hues. These confusions are partly historical and arose in scientific uncertainty about the color perception that was not resolved until the late 19th-century when the artistic notions were already entrenched. They also arise from the attempt to describe the highly contextual and flexible behavior of color perception in terms of abstract color sensations that can be generated equivalently by any visual media. Many historical \\"color theorists\\" have assumed that three \\"pure\\" primary colors can mix all possible colors, and any failure of specific paints or inks to match this ideal performance is due to the impurity or imperfection of the colorants. In reality, only imaginary \\"primary colors\\" used in colorimetry can \\"mix\\" or quantify all visible (perceptually possible) colors; but to do this, these imaginary primaries are defined as lying outside the range of visible colors; i.e., they cannot be seen. Any three real \\"primary\\" colors of light, paint or ink can mix only a limited range of colors, called a gamut, which is always smaller (contains fewer colors) than the full range of colors humans can perceive.  Historical background  Color theory was originally formulated in terms of three \\"primary\\" or \\"primitive\\" colors‚Äîred, yellow and blue (RYB)‚Äîbecause these colors were believed capable of mixing all other colors. Goethe's color wheel from his 1810 Theory of Colours The RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th-century theories of color vision, as the fundamental sensory qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors, and conversely, in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological color effects, in particular the contrast between \\"complementary\\" or opposing hues that are produced by color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the Theory of Colours (1810) by the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast (1839) by the French industrial chemist Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul. Charles Hayter published A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information (London 1826), in which he described how all colors could be obtained from just three. Page from A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information by Charles Hayter Subsequently, German and English scientists established in the late 19th century that color perception is best described in terms of a different set of primary colors‚Äîred, green and blue-violet (RGB)‚Äîmodeled through the additive mixture of three monochromatic lights. Subsequent research anchored these primary colors in the differing responses to light by three types of color receptors or cones in the retina (trichromacy). On this basis the quantitative description of the color mixture or colorimetry developed in the early 20th century, along with a series of increasingly sophisticated models of color space and color perception, such as the opponent process theory. Across the same period, industrial chemistry radically expanded the color range of lightfast synthetic pigments, allowing for substantially improved saturation in color mixtures of dyes, paints, and inks. It also created the dyes and chemical processes necessary for color photography. As a result, three-color printing became aesthetically and economically feasible in mass printed media, and the artists' color theory was adapted to primary colors most effective in inks or photographic dyes: cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). (In printing, dark colors are supplemented by black ink, known as the CMYK system; in both printing and photography, white is provided by the color of the paper.) These CMY primary colors were reconciled with the RGB primaries, and subtractive color mixing with additive color mixing, by defining the CMY primaries as substances that absorbed only one of the retinal primary colors: cyan absorbs only red (‚àíR+G+B), magenta only green (+R‚àíG+B), and yellow only blue-violet (+R+G‚àíB). It is important to add that the CMYK, or process, color printing is meant as an economical way of producing a wide range of colors for printing, but is deficient in reproducing certain colors, notably orange and slightly deficient in reproducing purples. A wider range of colors can be obtained with the addition of other colors to the printing process, such as in Pantone's Hexachrome printing ink system (six colors), among others. Munsell's color system represented as a three- dimensional solid showing all three color making attributes: lightness, saturation and hue. For much of the 19th-century artistic color theory either lagged behind scientific understanding or was augmented by science books written for the lay public, in particular Modern Chromatics (1879) by the American physicist Ogden Rood, and early color atlases developed by Albert Munsell (Munsell Book of Color, 1915, see Munsell color system) and Wilhelm Ostwald (Color Atlas, 1919). Major advances were made in the early 20th century by artists teaching or associated with the German Bauhaus, in particular Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Faber Birren and Josef Albers, whose writings mix speculation with an empirical or demonstration-based study of color design principles.  Traditional color theory = Complementary colors  Chevreul's 1855 \\"chromatic diagram\\" based on the RYB color model, showing complementary colors and other relationships For the mixing of colored light, Isaac Newton's color wheel is often used to describe complementary colors, which are colors that cancel each other's hue to produce an achromatic (white, gray or black) light mixture. Newton offered as a conjecture that colors exactly opposite one another on the hue circle cancel out each other's hue; this concept was demonstrated more thoroughly in the 19th century. A key assumption in Newton's hue circle was that the \\"fiery\\" or maximum saturated hues are located on the outer circumference of the circle, while achromatic white is at the center. Then the saturation of the mixture of two spectral hues was predicted by the straight line between them; the mixture of three colors was predicted by the \\"center of gravity\\" or centroid of three triangle points, and so on. Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors of the RYB color model According to traditional color theory based on subtractive primary colors and the RYB color model, yellow mixed with purple, orange mixed with blue, or red mixed with green produces an equivalent gray and are the painter's complementary colors. These contrasts form the basis of Chevreul's law of color contrast: colors that appear together will be altered as if mixed with the complementary color of the other color. A piece of yellow fabric placed on a blue background will appear tinted orange because orange is the complementary color to blue. However, when complementary colors are chosen based on the definition by light mixture, they are not the same as the artists' primary colors. This discrepancy becomes important when color theory is applied across media. Digital color management uses a hue circle defined according to additive primary colors (the RGB color model), as the colors in a computer monitor are additive mixtures of light, not subtractive mixtures of paints. One reason the artist's primary colors work at all is due to the imperfect pigments being used have sloped absorption curves, and change color with concentration. A pigment that is pure red at high concentrations can behave more like magenta at low concentrations. This allows it to make purples that would otherwise be impossible. Likewise, a blue that is ultramarine at high concentrations appears cyan at low concentrations, allowing it to be used to mix green. Chromium red pigments can appear orange, and then yellow, as the concentration is reduced. It is even possible to mix very low concentrations of the blue mentioned and the chromium red to get a greenish color. This works much better with oil colors than it does with watercolors and dyes. The old primaries depend on sloped absorption curves and pigment leakages to work, while newer scientifically derived ones depend solely on controlling the amount of absorption in certain parts of the spectrum. Another reason the correct primary colors were not used by early artists is they were not available as durable pigments. Modern methods in chemistry were needed to produce them.  Warm vs. cool colors  The distinction between \\"warm\\" and \\"cool\\" colors has been important since at least the late 18th century. The difference (as traced by etymologies in the Oxford English Dictionary), seems related to the observed contrast in landscape light, between the \\"warm\\" colors associated with daylight or sunset, and the \\"cool\\" colors associated with a gray or overcast day. Warm colors are often said to be hues from red through yellow, browns, and tans included; cool colors are often said to be the hues from blue-green through blue violet, most grays included. There is a historical disagreement about the colors that anchor the polarity, but 19th- century sources put the peak contrast between red-orange and greenish-blue. Color theory has described perceptual and psychological effects to this contrast. Warm colors are said to advance or appear more active in a painting, while cool colors tend to recede; used in interior design or fashion, warm colors are said to arouse or stimulate the viewer, while cool colors calm and relax. Most of these effects, to the extent they are real, can be attributed to the higher saturation and lighter value of warm pigments in contrast to cool pigments; brown is a dark, unsaturated warm color that few people think of as visually active or psychologically arousing. The traditional warm/cool association of a color is reversed relative to the color temperature of a theoretical radiating black body; the hottest stars radiate blue (cool) light, and the coolest radiate red (warm) light. The hottest radiating bodies (e.g. stars) have a \\"cool\\" color, while the less hot bodies radiate with a \\"warm\\" color (image in Kelvin scale) This contrast is further seen in the psychological associations of colors with the Doppler effect seen in astronomical objects. Traditional psychological associations, where warm colors are associated with advancing objects and cool colors with receding objects, are directly opposite those seen in astrophysics, where stars or galaxies moving towards our viewpoint on Earth are blueshifted (advancing) and stars or galaxies moving away from Earth are redshifted (receding). Doppler redshift for receding and blueshift for advancing  Achromatic colors  Any color that lacks strong chromatic content is said to be unsaturated, achromatic, near-neutral, or neutral. Near neutrals include browns, tans, pastels, and darker colors. Near neutrals can be of any hue or lightness. Pure achromatic, or neutral colors include black, white and all grays. Near neutrals are obtained by mixing pure colors with white, black or grey, or by mixing two complementary colors. In color theory, neutral colors are easily modified by adjacent more saturated colors and they appear to take on the hue complementary to the saturated color; e.g., next to a bright red couch, a gray wall will appear distinctly greenish. Black and white have long been known to combine \\"well\\" with almost any other colors; black decreases the apparent saturation or brightness of colors paired with it and white shows off all hues to equal effect.  Tints and shades  When mixing colored light (additive color models), the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red, green, and blue (RGB) is always white, not gray or black. When we mix colorants, such as the pigments in paint mixtures, a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma, or saturation, than the parent colors. This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color‚Äîa gray or near-black. Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness, or energy level; in painting, lightness is adjusted through mixture with white, black, or a color's complement. It is common among some painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint‚Äîproducing colors called shades‚Äîor lighten a color by adding white‚Äîproducing colors called tints. However, it is not always the best way for representational painting, as an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in hue. For instance, darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows, reds, and oranges, to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum. Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges. Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. purplish-red added to yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color (e.g. adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum).  Split primary colors  In painting and other visual arts, two-dimensional color wheels or three- dimensional color solids are used as tools to teach beginners the essential relationships between colors. The organization of colors in a particular color model depends on the purpose of that model: some models show relationships based on human color perception, whereas others are based on the color mixing properties of a particular medium such as a computer display or set of paints. This system is still popular among contemporary painters, as it is basically a simplified version of Newton's geometrical rule that colors closer together on the hue circle will produce more vibrant mixtures. However, with the range of contemporary paints available, many artists simply add more paints to their palette as desired for a variety of practical reasons. For example, they may add a scarlet, purple and/or green paint to expand the mixable gamut; and they include one or more dark colors (especially \\"earth\\" colors such as yellow ochre or burnt sienna) simply because they are convenient to have premixed. Printers commonly augment a CMYK palette with spot (trademark specific) ink colors.  Color harmony  It has been suggested that \\"Colors seen together to produce a pleasing affective response are said to be in harmony\\".Burchett, K. E. (2002). \\"Color Harmony\\". Color Research and Application, 27 (1), pp. 28‚Äì31. However, color harmony is a complex notion because human responses to color are both affective and cognitive, involving emotional response and judgment. Hence, our responses to color and the notion of color harmony is open to the influence of a range of different factors. These factors include individual differences (such as age, gender, personal preference, affective state, etc.) as well as cultural, sub-cultural, and socially-based differences which gives rise to conditioning and learned responses about color. In addition, context always has an influence on responses about color and the notion of color harmony, and this concept is also influenced by temporal factors (such as changing trends) and perceptual factors (such as simultaneous contrast) which may impinge on human response to color. The following conceptual model illustrates this 21st-century approach to color harmony: : \\\\text{Color harmony} = f(\\\\operatorname{Col} 1, 2, 3, \\\\dots, n) \\\\cdot (ID + CE + CX + P + T) wherein color harmony is a function (f) of the interaction between color/s (Col 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, n) and the factors that influence positive aesthetic response to color: individual differences (ID) such as age, gender, personality and affective state; cultural experiences (CE), the prevailing context (CX) which includes setting and ambient lighting; intervening perceptual effects (P) and the effects of time (T) in terms of prevailing social trends.O'Connor, Z. (2010). \\"Color harmony revisited\\". Color Research and Application, 35 (4), pp. 267‚Äì273. Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. G√∂ttingen, 1775, plate III. In addition, given that humans can perceive over 2.8 million different colors,Pointer, M. R. & Attridge, G.G. (1998). \\"The number of discernible colors\\". Color Research and Application, 23 (1), pp. 52‚Äì54. it has been suggested that the number of possible color combinations is virtually infinite thereby implying that predictive color harmony formulae are fundamentally unsound.Hard, A. & Sivik, L. (2001). \\"A theory of colors in combination ‚Äì A descriptive model related to the NCS color-order system\\". Color Research and Application, 26 (1), pp. 4‚Äì28. Despite this, many color theorists have devised formulae, principles or guidelines for color combination with the aim being to predict or specify positive aesthetic response or \\"color harmony\\". Color wheel models have often been used as a basis for color combination principles or guidelines and for defining relationships between colors. Some theorists and artists believe juxtapositions of complementary color will produce strong contrast, a sense of visual tension as well as \\"color harmony\\"; while others believe juxtapositions of analogous colors will elicit a positive aesthetic response. Color combination guidelines (or formulas) suggest that colors next to each other on the color wheel model (analogous colors) tend to produce a single-hued or monochromatic color experience and some theorists also refer to these as \\"simple harmonies\\". In addition, split complementary color schemes usually depict a modified complementary pair, with instead of the \\"true\\" second color being chosen, a range of analogous hues around it are chosen, i.e. the split complements of red are blue-green and yellow-green. A triadic color scheme adopts any three colors approximately equidistant around a color wheel model. Feisner and Mahnke are among a number of authors who provide color combination guidelines in greater detail.Feisner, E. A. (2000). Colour: How to use colour in art and design. London: Laurence King.Mahnke, F. (1996). Color, environment and human response. New York: John Wiley & Sons. Ignaz Schifferm√ºller, Versuch eines Farbensystems (Vienna, 1772), plate I. Color combination formulae and principles may provide some guidance but have limited practical application. This is due to the influence of contextual, perceptual, and temporal factors which will influence how color/s are perceived in any given situation, setting, or context. Such formulae and principles may be useful in fashion, interior and graphic design, but much depends on the tastes, lifestyle, and cultural norms of the viewer or consumer. As early as the ancient Greek philosophers, many theorists have devised color associations and linked particular connotative meanings to specific colors. However, connotative color associations and color symbolism tends to be culture-bound and may also vary across different contexts and circumstances. For example, red has many different connotative and symbolic meanings from exciting, arousing, sensual, romantic, and feminine; to a symbol of good luck; and also acts as a signal of danger. Such color associations tend to be learned and do not necessarily hold irrespective of individual and cultural differences or contextual, temporal or perceptual factors. It is important to note that while color symbolism and color associations exist, their existence does not provide evidential support for color psychology or claims that color has therapeutic properties.O'Connor, Z. (2010). \\"Colour psychology and color therapy: Caveat emptor\\". Color Research and Application = Monochromatic = The monochromatic formula chooses only one color (or hue). Variations of the color are created by changing the value and saturation of the color. Since only one hue is used, the color and its variations are guaranteed to work.  Current status  Color theory has not developed an explicit explanation of how specific media affect color appearance: colors have always been defined in the abstract, and whether the colors were inks or paints, oils or watercolors, transparencies or reflecting prints, computer displays or movie theaters, was not considered especially relevant. Josef Albers investigated the effects of relative contrast and color saturation on the illusion of transparency, but this is an exception to the rule.

The company announced it would cease operations on November 24, 1997 and was declared bankrupt by the Tokyo District Court on June 2, 1999.  History  Yamaichi, formed in 1897, was at one time one of the four major Japanese brokerages. Its clients were major Japanese corporations. In the boom of the 1980s it was given specified sums of money by 10 of its clients to invest as it saw fit. A sharp downturn in the early 1990s and poor dealings by Yamaichi generated losses of more than 200 billion yen. Fearing the demise of the firm through loss of reputation that would result if the scale of losses became known, the brokerage shouldered the loss of its clients, and moved it off balance sheet.\\"Yamaichi chief gives Diet testimony on 'tobashi' trades\\".

Retrieved 8 November 2011 Yamaichi sold in a private placement Touchwood Pacific Partners limited partnership to about 50 Japanese institutional or private investors in the amount of $191 million in 1990 for The Walt Disney Company film production.  Tobashi and collapse  In January 1992, Yamaichi executives resorted to such a tobashi scheme, setting up a separate company called Yamaichi Enterprise which opened an account at the Tokyo branch of Z√ºrich, Switzerland-based Credit Suisse. Depositing ¬•200 billion in Japanese government bonds, the Yamaichi subsidiary then used the dummy companies to generate profits for clients while eventually absorbing losses of ¬•158.3 billion. A separate scheme using foreign currency bonds resulted in losses of ¬•106.5 billion being hidden in Yamaichi's Australian subsidiary. The magazine Weekly Toyo Keizai uncovered the fraud in April 1997. For its journalism the magazine was awarded the Editors' Choice Magazine Journalism Award. Tsugio Yukihira, chairman of the brokerage at the time of its collapse, acknowledged in front of a Japanese Diet hearing that the activities were illegal. He said that only three people at the brokerage, namely himself former President Atsuo Miki and another individual, knew about the arrangements; he declined to name the 10 firms involved in the illegal trading. The company announced it would cease operations on November 24, 1997 and was declared bankrupt by the Tokyo District Court on June 2, 1999. The company's last president, Shohei Nozawa made a tearful public apology on Japanese television. Japan's Minister of Finance announced that steps would be taken to ensure the event would not further destabilize the frail Japanese banking system and economy as a whole. On June 1, 2001, the company's last chairman, Tsugio Yukihira, settled a lawsuit filed in Tokyo District Court. Suitors alleged his window-dressing tobashi schemes and illegal dealings had undermined the brokerage and led to its demise.

These high latitudes are dominated by floating sea ice covering much of the Arctic ocean in the north, and by the Antarctic ice sheet on the continent of Antarctica in the South. Definitions The Arctic has various definitions, including the region north of the Arctic Circle (currently Epoch 2010 at 66¬∞33'44\\" N), or the region north of 60¬∞ north latitude, or the region from the North Pole south to the timberline. The Antarctic is usually defined as south of 60¬∞ south latitude, or the continent of Antarctica. The 1959 Antarctic Treaty uses the former definition. The two polar regions are distinguished from the other two climatic and biomatic belts of Earth, a tropics belt near the equator, and two middle latitude regions located between the tropics and polar regions. Climate Polar regions receive less intense solar radiation than the other parts of Earth because the sun's energy arrives at an oblique angle, spreading over a larger area, and also travels a longer distance through the Earth's atmosphere in which it may be absorbed, scattered or reflected, which is the same thing that causes winters to be colder than the rest of the year in temperate areas. The axial tilt of the Earth has a major effect on climate of the polar regions. However, since the polar regions are the farthest from the equator, they receive the weakest solar radiation and are therefore generally frigid year round due to the earth's axial tilt of 23.5¬∞ not being enough to create a high maximum midday declination to sufficiently strengthen the sun's rays even in summer, except for relatively brief periods in peripheral areas near the polar circles. The large amount of ice and snow also reflects a large part of what weak sunlight the Polar regions receive, contributing to the cold. Polar regions are characterized by extremely cold temperatures, heavy glaciation wherever there is sufficient precipitation to form permanent ice, and extreme variations in daylight hours, with twenty-four hours of daylight in summer, and complete darkness at mid-winter. Circumpolar Arctic region North polar region polar bears There are many settlements in Earth's north polar region. Countries with claims to Arctic regions are: the United States (Alaska), Canada (Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut), Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, and Russia. Arctic circumpolar populations often share more in common with each other than with other populations within their national boundaries. As such, the northern polar region is diverse in human settlements and cultures. Antarctica and the Southern sea South polar region penguin The southern polar region has no permanent human habitation. McMurdo Station is the largest research station in Antarctica, run by the United States. Other notable stations include Palmer Station and Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station (United States), Esperanza Base and Marambio Base (Argentina), Scott Base (New Zealand), and Vostok Station (Russia). While there are no indigenous human cultures, there is a complex ecosystem, especially along Antarctica's coastal zones. Coastal upwelling provides abundant nutrients which feeds krill, a type of marine crustacea, which in turn feeds a complex of living creatures from penguins to blue whales.

It is a resident breeder across sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia, although it has seasonal movements. It lays two or three eggs on a ground scrape. These are conspicuous and unmistakable birds. They are medium-large waders with a black head other than a white forehead, lower face and bands across the rear head and nape. There is a wispy black crest like northern lapwing and the bill and legs are red. The tail is white, tipped black. In flight, the black-headed lapwing's upperwings have black flight feathers and brown coverts separated by a white bar. The underwings are white with black flight feathers. This species is a common breeder in wet lowland habitats close to water. It often feeds in drier habitats, such as golf courses and grassy scrub, picking insects and other invertebrates from the ground. The black-headed lapwing has a metallic tink-tink call. Taxonomy The black-headed lapwing was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1781 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Senegal. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Charadrius tectus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The black-headed lapwing is now placed in the genus Vanellus that was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The generic name Vanellus is the Medieval Latin for a \\"lapwing\\". It is a diminutive of the Latin vanus meaning \\"winnowing\\" or \\"fan\\". The specific epithet tectus is Latin for \\"covered\\" (i.e. blackcrowned).

Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester (c. 11703 November 1219) was one of the leaders of the baronial rebellion against John, King of England, and a major figure in both the kingdoms of Scotland and England in the decades around the turn of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Scottish Upbringing Although he was an Anglo-Norman, Saer de Quincy's father, Robert de Quincy, had married and held important lordships in the Scottish kingdom of his cousin King William the Lion. His mother, Arabella, was the heiress of the lordship of Leuchars and through her Robert became lord over lands in Fife, Perth and Lothian (see below).Complete Peerage p.747 Saer's own rise to prominence in England came partly through his marriage to Margaret, the younger sister of Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester. Earl Robert died in 1204, and left Margaret as co-heiress to the vast earldom along with her elder sister. The estate was split in half, and after the final division was ratified in 1207, de Quincy was made Earl of Winchester.CP p.749 Earl of Winchester Seal of Robert Fitzwalter (d.1235). So close was the alliance between both men that the seal shows the arms of Saer de Quincy (seven mascles 3,3,1) on a separate shield before FitzWalter horse, with FitzWalter's own arms on his own shield and on his horse's caparison. Following his marriage, Winchester became a prominent military and diplomatic figure in England. There is no evidence of any close alliance with King John, however, and his rise to importance was probably due to his newly acquired magnate status and the family connections that underpinned it. Saer seems to have developed a close personal relationship with his cousin, Robert Fitzwalter (died 1235). In 1203, they served as co-commanders of the garrison at the major fortress of Vaudreuil in Normandy. They surrendered the castle without a fight to Philip II of France, fatally weakening the English position in northern France. Although popular opinion seems to have blamed them for the capitulation, a royal writ is extant stating that the castle was surrendered at King John's command, and both Winchester and Fitzwalter endured personal humiliation and heavy ransoms at the hands of the French. In Scotland, he was perhaps more successful. In 1211 to 1212, the Earl of Winchester commanded an imposing retinue of a hundred knights and a hundred serjeants in William the Lion's campaign against the Mac William rebels, a force which some historians have suggested may have been the mercenary force from Brabant lent to the campaign by John. Magna Carta Winchester Great Hall. In 1215, when the baronial rebellion broke out, Robert Fitzwalter became the military commander, and the Earl of Winchester joined him, acting as one of the chief authors of Magna Carta and negotiators with John; both cousins were among the 25 guarantors of the Magna Carta. De Quincy fought against John in the troubles that followed the sealing of the Charter, and, again with Fitzwalter, travelled to France to invite Prince Louis of France to take the English throne. He and Fitzwalter were subsequently among the most committed and prominent supporters of Louis's candidature for the kingship, against both John and the infant Henry III. The Fifth Crusade When military defeat cleared the way for Henry III to take the throne, de Quincy went on crusade, perhaps in fulfilment of an earlier vow. In 1219 he left to join the Fifth Crusade, then besieging Damietta. While in the east, he fell sick and died. He was buried in Acre, the capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, rather than in Egypt, and his heart was brought back and interred at Garendon Abbey near Loughborough, a house endowed by his wife's family. Family The family of de Quincy had arrived in England after the Norman Conquest, and took their name from Cuinchy in the Arrondissement of B√©thune; the personal name \\"Saer\\" was used by them over several generations. Both names are variously spelt in primary sources and older modern works, the first name being sometimes rendered Saher or Seer, and the surname as Quency or Quenci. The first recorded Saer de Quincy (known to historians as \\"Saer I\\") was lord of the manor of Long Buckby in Northamptonshire in the earlier twelfth century, and second husband of Matilda of St Liz, stepdaughter of King David I of Scotland by Maud of Northumbria. This marriage produced two sons, Saer II and Robert de Quincy. It was Robert, the younger son, who was the father of the Saer de Quincy who eventually became Earl of Winchester. By her first husband Robert Fitz Richard, Matilda was also the paternal grandmother of Earl Saer's close ally, Robert Fitzwalter. Robert de Quincy seems to have inherited no English lands from his father, and pursued a knightly career in Scotland, where he is recorded from around 1160 as a close companion of his cousin, King William the Lion. By 1170 he had married Orabilis, heiress of the Scottish lordship of Leuchars and, through her, he became lord of an extensive complex of estates north of the border which included lands in Fife, Strathearn and Lothian. Saer de Quincy, the son of Robert de Quincy and Orabilis of Leuchars, was raised largely in Scotland. His absence from English records for the first decades of his life has led some modern historians and genealogists to confuse him with his uncle, Saer II, who took part in the rebellion of Henry the Young King in 1173, when the future Earl of Winchester can have been no more than a toddler. Saer II's line ended without direct heirs, and his nephew and namesake would eventually inherit his estate, uniting his primary Scottish holdings with the family's Northamptonshire patrimony, and possibly some lands in France. Issue Sometime between 1188 and 1193 de Quincy married Margaret, youngest daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. By his wife Margaret de Beaumont, Earl Saer had: *Lora, who married Sir William de Valognes, Chamberlain of Scotland. *Arabella, who married Sir Richard Harcourt. *Robert (died 1217); before 1206 he married Hawise of Chester, 1st Countess of Lincoln, sister and co-heiress of Randolph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester. *Roger, who succeeded his father as earl of Winchester (though he did not take formal possession of the earldom until after his mother's death). * (second son of that name; died 1257), who married Elen, daughter of the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great. *Hawise, who married Hugh de Vere, 4th Earl of Oxford. *Mary, who married Hugh_le_Despenser_(sheriff).

Each submarine was in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . The propulsion system was built around three propeller shafts; the J-class were the only triple-screwed submarines ever built by the British. Propulsion came from three 12-cylinder diesel motors when on the surface, and electric motors when submerged. Top speed was on the surface (the fastest submarines in the world at the time of construction), and underwater. Range was at . Armament consisted of six 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes (four forward, one on each beam), plus a 4-inch deck gun. Originally, the gun was mounted on a breastwork fitted forward of the conning tower, but the breastwork was later extended to the bow and merged into the hull for streamlining, and the gun was relocated to a platform fitted to the front of the conning tower. The conning tower on J7 was sited further back than her sister boats, as the control room was located behind the machinery spaces. 44 personnel were aboard. J7 was built by HM Dockyard Devonport in Plymouth and launched on 12 February 1917. Operational history After the war, the British Admiralty decided that the best way to protect the Pacific region was with a force of submarines and cruisers. To this end, they offered the six surviving submarines of the J-class to the Royal Australian Navy as gifts. J1 and her sisters were commissioned into the RAN in April 1919, and sailed for Australia on 9 April, in the company of the cruisers and , and the tender . The flotilla reached Thursday Island on 29 June, and Sydney on 10 July. Because of the submarines' condition after the long voyage, they were immediately taken out of service for refits. Wreck of HMAS J7 at the Sandringham Yacht Club marina By the time J7 was returned to service in June 1922, the cost of maintaining the boats and deteriorating economic conditions saw the six submarines decommissioned and marked for disposal.

Operational history=World War II After entering active service, Junee was briefly assigned to New Guinea before being redeployed to Darwin, where she served as an anti-submarine patrol ship until February 1945, when the corvette underwent refit in Melbourne. In April 1945, Junee was sent to New Guinea, to serve as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship. In August, the corvette fired her weapons in anger for the first time; sinking three Japanese supply barges while in the Sangir Islands. The corvette was later assigned to Balikpapan as a guard ship, where she remained until the end of World War II. Following the end of the war, Junee evacuated Australian prisoners-of-war and civilians, assisted in the transportation of occupation forces, and aided in the reestablishment of Dutch authority in the Netherlands East Indies. After fulfilling these duties, Junee returned to Australia, and was paid off into reserve in Melbourne on 21 January 1946.

The need to be stored inside the submarine necessitated compromises in design that made this single-seat seaplane of little practical use. Design and development Designed from the outset for use on U-boat \\"cruisers\\", like the Type XI B, the Ar 231 was a light parasol-wing aircraft. The aircraft was powered by a 119 kW (160 hp) Hirth HM 501 inline engine, weighed around 1,000 kg (2,200 lb), and had a 10 m (33 ft) wingspan. The design led to a simple and compact aircraft that could be fitted into a storage cylinder only 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in diameter. For ease of storage, the Ar 231's wings featured detachable sections that two operators could remove in less than six minutes. One unusual feature was an offset wing design, with the right wing root attaching to the wing's tilted center section (elevated above the fuselage, as on all parasol-wing designs) and lower than the left wing root, to allow the wings to be quickly folded up. Arado Ar 231 Model side view Operational history Testing soon revealed the Ar 231s to be fragile, underpowered, and difficult to fly even during calm weather, and, as a result, development ended in favour of the Focke Achgelis Fa 330 gyroglider.

She was launched on 7 August 1941 by the wife of Thomas Playford IV, then Premier of South Australia, and was commissioned into the RAN on 7 April 1942. Operational history=RAN service After completing trials, Kalgoorlie was assigned as a convoy escort. Initially operating along the east coast of Sydney, the corvette was moved to Darwin in August 1942 and taken with convoys between Australia, Thursday Island, and Timor. On 25 September, Kalgoorlie and sister ship evacuated the ship's company of the destroyer , which had run aground at Betano Bay two days before. In early December, Kalgoorlie was involved in the search for survivors from her sister ship , which had been sunk by Japanese aircraft on 1 December. Kalgoorlie eventually recovered 49 of the survivors. In April 1943, the corvette returned to the east coast of Australia, still operating as a convoy escort. On 15 June, a thirteen-ship convoy heading for Brisbane and escorted by Kalgoorlie and sister ships , , , and , was attacked off Smoky Cape. The United States Army Transport Portmar and the US Navy Landing ship were torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-174: the former sinking in minutes with the loss of only two lives, while 26 were killed aboard the latter ship, which survived and was towed to port. Despite attempts to locate the submarine immediately after the attack, and a multiple-day search performed by Kalgoorlie, I-174 escaped unharmed. This was the last submarine attack to be made on the east coast of Australia during World War II. Kalgoorlie spent the first half of 1944 as a convoy escort between Queensland and New Guinea, then joined sister ship in clearing the minefields laid by throughout the Great Barrier Reef during the early part of the war. During August and September, the two corvettes located and destroyed almost 500 mines. Kalgoorlie spent the rest of the year on convoy escort duties, before joining the British Pacific Fleet at the end of 1944. The corvette operated with the Pacific Fleet until 15 July 1945, when she arrived in Brisbane for a refit. Kalgoorlie was still undergoing refit when the war ended. After the refit, the corvette operated in New Guinea and Australian waters until early May 1946.

Characteristics These are unmistakable birds, but shy and often inconspicuous in the treetops. They are approximately long, including a long tail and a bill. They boast a winglength of and weigh approximately 360 g. The plumage is glossy violet, except for the yellow forehead, chestnut crown and white ear coverts; the bill is thick and red. In flight, the violet turaco's crimson primary flight feathers contrast with the violet plumage. The red colour in the wings is typical of turacos. Habitat It is resident in West Africa, and has an extremely large range from Senegal through to the Nigeria, with an isolated population in Chad and Central African Republic. It occurs in tropical savannas, wetlands, woodlands and forests. Diet Diet consists of fruit, and they are quite partial to figs, but they will also eat leaves, buds, flowers, insects, snails and slugs. Reproduction Cooperative breeding behavior has been observed in captivity in this species. The female lays two eggs in a flimsy tree platform nest. Threats This species is locally common, but is vulnerable to trapping for the pet trade in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana. Behavior Turacos are social birds, travelling in flocks of around ten to twelve individuals. They are not strong fliers but they can run quickly through the branches. Violet turaco has a loud ' call.

It is the only subspecies without a white line below the eye Distribution Guinea turaco has an extremely large range and a stable population. Bird Life International It can be found in forests of West and Central Africa, ranging from Senegal east to DR Congo and south to northern Angola. It is present in the Republic of the Congo, Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. Habitat This species inhabits subtropical and tropical moist lowland, gallery forests and tropical rain forests edge, often near cultivated areas. It is common in climax forest with plentiful tall trees, from sea level to about . Description The Guinea turaco, often inconspicuous in the treetops, is approximately long, including a long tail. The weight can reach . The plumage is largely brilliant green and blue and the tail and wings are dark purplish, except for the crimson primary feathers that are very distinct in flight. On the head is present an erectile semi-circular green crest. On the eyes there are red and white patches. The bill is thick and red. In the westernmost subspecies Tauraco persa buffoni, which sometimes is known as the Buffon's turaco, there is a white line above and in front of the eye and a black line below the eye. In the nominate subspecies (Tauraco persa persa) of the central part of its range and zenkeri of the southeastern part there also is a second white line below the black line. Unlike similar turacos with red bills, even adult Guinea turacos lack a white rear edge to the crest. Biology Video clip Tauraco persa is normally sedentary and strongly territorial. These birds feed on wide variety of wild and cultivated tropical fruits (for instance on Musanga, Macaranga, Rauvolfia, Cissus and Ficus species, etc.), but also on blossoms. They do not fly very well, preferring to climb from branch to branch. They breed in May‚ÄìJune and August in Cameroon, from December to February and from June to September in Gabon, while in Sierra Leone they breed in June and in October. Females lay two eggs in a tree platform nest. The Guinea turaco has a loud cawr-cawr call, consisting of 10‚Äì16 raucous cawing notes.

Devices and/or systems that have been described as mass storage include tape libraries, RAID systems, and a variety of computer drives such as hard disk drives, magnetic tape drives, magneto- optical disc drives, optical disc drives, memory cards, and solid-state drives. It also includes experimental forms like holographic memory. Mass storage includes devices with removable and non-removable media. It does not include random access memory (RAM). There are two broad classes of mass storage: local data in devices such as smartphones or computers, and enterprise servers and data centers for the cloud. For local storage, SSDs are on the way to replacing HDDs. Considering the mobile segment from phones to notebooks, the majority of systems today is based on NAND Flash. As for Enterprise and data centers, storage tiers have established using a mix of SSD and HDD. https://www.hyperstone.com/en/NAND-Flash-is-displacing-hard-disk- drives-1249,12728.html, NAND Flash is displacing Hard Disk Drives, Retrieved 29. May 2018 s to grow; however, in any time frame, common mass storage devices have tended to be much larger and at the same time much slower than common realizations of contemporaneous primary storage technology. The term mass storage was used in the PC marketplace for devices far smaller than devices that were not considered mass storage in the mainframe marketplace. Mass storage devices are characterized by: * Sustainable transfer speed * Seek time * Cost * Capacity  Storage media  Magnetic disks are the predominant storage media in personal computers. Optical discs, however, are almost exclusively used in the large-scale distribution of retail software, music and movies because of the cost and manufacturing efficiency of the molding process used to produce DVD and compact discs and the nearly-universal presence of reader drives in personal computers and consumer appliances. Flash memory (in particular, NAND flash) has an established and growing niche as a replacement for magnetic hard disks in high performance enterprise computing installations due to its robustness stemming from its lack of moving parts, and its inherently much lower latency when compared to conventional magnetic hard drive solutions. Flash memory has also long been popular as removable storage such as USB sticks, where it de facto makes up the market. This is because it scales better cost-wise in lower capacity ranges, as well as its durability. It has also made its way onto laptops in the form of SSDs, sharing similar reasons with enterprise computing: Namely, markedly high degrees of resistance to physical impact, which is again, due to the lack of moving parts, as well as a performance increase over conventional magnetic hard disks and markedly reduced weight and power consumption. Flash has also made its way onto cell phones... The design of computer architectures and operating systems are often dictated by the mass storage and bus technology of their time.. (A discussion of recent trends in mass storage.)  Usage  Mass storage devices used in desktop and most server computers typically have their data organized in a file system. The choice of file system is often important in maximizing the performance of the device: general purpose file systems (such as NTFS and HFS, for example) tend to do poorly on slow-seeking optical storage such as compact discs. Some relational databases can also be deployed on mass storage devices without an intermediate file system or storage manager. Oracle and MySQL, for example, can store table data directly on raw block devices. On removable media, archive formats (such as tar archives on magnetic tape, which pack file data end-to-end) are sometimes used instead of file systems because they are more portable and simpler to stream. On embedded computers, it is common to memory map the contents of a mass storage device (usually ROM or flash memory) so that its contents can be traversed as in-memory data structures or executed directly by programs.

It is referred to as the University Belt or simply called ‚ÄúU-Belt‚Äù for numerous colleges and universities are found within the district such as the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest extant university in Asia; the National University, the first private nonsectarian and coeducational institution in the Philippines; the Far Eastern University, known for its Art Deco campus and cultural heritage site of the Philippines; and the University of the East, once dubbed as the largest university in Asia in terms of enrollment. The district is bordered by the districts of Quiapo and San Miguel in the south, Santa Mesa district in the south and east, Santa Cruz district in the west and north, and Quezon City in the northeast. Aside from being the \\"University Belt\\", Sampaloc is also known to Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces for its Dangwa flower market, located in Dimasalang Road, well known as the selling center for cut flowers from all over the Philippines, mainly Baguio. Sampaloc is also the location of a former colonial mansion, now called Windsor Inn, which is popular among backpackers and budget travelers. Barangays 395-636 of the City of Manila would all have belonged to Sampaloc and comprise 241 barangays for the district. However, what are now known as barangays 587-636 became part of Sta. Mesa when these areas were separated from Sampaloc after Sta. Mesa became a separate parish in 1911. Sta. Mesa is now a part of the 6th congressional district of Manila, while Sampaloc is the sole district comprising the 4th congressional district of Manila. Many streets in Sampaloc, particularly in the northeast portion divided by Espa√±a and Lacson avenues, have names that are directly associated with the Philippine National Hero Jos√© Rizal, either named after the places (e.g. Calamba, Dapitan), real-life people (e.g. Blumentritt), characters from his novels (e.g. Ibarra, Maria Clara) or his pen names (e.g. Laong Laan, Dimasalang).  Etymology  \\"Sampaloc\\" or \\"Sampalok\\" is the native Tagalog word for the tamarind fruit. The place was likely named after it due to tamarind trees that may have been rampant in the area.  History  Sampaloc Church Sampaloc, Manila is the area where American colonial troops and the Filipino revolutionaries fought at the turn of the 20th Century. Filipinos accused Americans of shooting a Filipino soldier, and likewise returned fire. A historical marker which had stood on the San Juan Bridge was ordered moved to Santa Mesa in 2003 after studies by Dr. Benito Legarda concluded that the shot was fired somewhere between Blockhouse 7 (within the city limits of Manila) and Barrio Santol (now a part of Sampaloc) on the connecting road that is now Sosiego Street..

Construction The 'Pink Palace' of Drumlanrig, constructed between 1679 and 1689 from distinctive pink sandstone, is an example of late 17th-century Renaissance architecture. The first Duke of Queensberry, William Douglas, had the castle built on the site of an ancient Douglas stronghold overlooking the Nith Valley. The castle has 120 rooms, 17 turrets and four towers. In 1984, aerial photography revealed the outline of a substantial Roman fort some 350 yards to the southeast of Drumlanrig Castle. The fort was partially excavated in 2004 by the Time Team television programme. Art collection The castle is home to part of the Buccleuch art collection which includes Rembrandt‚Äôs An Old Woman Reading, and Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna of the Yarnwinder, which was stolen in 2003 and returned in 2007 after being found in Glasgow, and many other paintings, tapestries and objects of art.

They run for about . At their southern end, they rise above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag's Head, and, to the north, they reach their maximum height of just north of O'Brien's Tower, a round stone tower near the midpoint of the cliffs, built in 1835 by Sir Cornelius O'Brien, then continue at lower heights. The closest settlements are the villages of Liscannor to the south, and Doolin to the north. From the cliffs, and from atop the tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. The cliffs rank among the most visited tourist sites in Ireland, with around 1.5 million visits per annum. Name A 19th-century Photochrom postcard of the cliffs, with Leacmayornagneeve rock in the foreground The cliffs take their name from an old promontory fort called Mothar or Moher, which once stood on Hag's Head, the southernmost point of the cliffed coast, now the site of Moher Tower. The writer Thomas Johnson Westropp referred to it in 1905 as Moher U√≠ Ruis or Moher U√≠ Ruidhin. The fort still stood in 1780 and is mentioned in an account from John Lloyd's A Short Tour Of Clare (1780). It was demolished in 1808 to provide material for a lookout/telegraph tower that was intended to provide warning in case of a French invasion during the Napoleonic wars. Tourism The cliffs are one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland and topped a list of attractions in 2006 by drawing almost one million visitors (at the official visitor centre, with additional visitors accessing other locales); the total visit number is now around 1.5 million per annum. Since 2011, they have formed a part of the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark, one of a family of geotourism destinations throughout Europe that are members of the European Geoparks Network and also recognized by UNESCO. The cliffs are also a \\"signature point\\" on the official Wild Atlantic Way tourist trail. While the cliffs can be accessed at multiple points, and there is an Cliff Walk,Cliffs of Moher Coastal Walk the majority of visitors come to the official visitor centre. Visitor centre Visitor centre In the 1990s the local authority, Clare County Council, initiated development plans to enable visitors to experience the cliffs without significant intrusive man-made amenities. In keeping with this approach, a modern visitor centre, the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience, was built into a hillside approaching the cliffs. The centre was planned to be environmentally sensitive in its use of renewable energy systems including geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels, and grey water recycling. The ‚Ç¨32 million facility was planned and built over a 17-year period and officially opened in February 2007. Exhibits include interactive media displays covering the geology, history, flora and fauna of the cliffs. A large multimedia screen displays a bird's-eye view from the cliffs, as well as video from the underwater caves below the cliffs. There are also two caf√©s and several shops. Accessibility is a priority, and wheelchairs are available to borrow. Cliffs of Moher Cruise As of 2018, the centre charges ‚Ç¨8 per adult, with children under 16 admitted free. This covers parking, access to the visitor centre and Atlantic Edge exhibition, and a contribution towards conservation and safety at the cliffs. =Visitor numbers= The visitor experience recorded 1,427,000 visits in 2016, up 14% on 2015, and up 52% in off-peak December, for example. In 2017 the Cliffs of Moher was the second most popular 'fee charging' tourist attraction in the country with 1,527,000 visitors. This increased again by 3.8% in 2018 to 1,580,010 visitors. The nature and speed of increase in visitor numbers has led to some capacity problems at peak times and in peak season. To counter this, visitors are increasingly encouraged to come at other times, with discounts given to coach operators who book for off-peak slots, and late opening of the centre introduced for July and much of August. Later-arriving visitors have also been facilitated by the fitting of automatically opening exit gates from the official car parking facilities. =Recognition= The Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience won an award in the Interpret Britain & Ireland Awards 2007 awarded by the Association of Heritage Interpretation (AHI). Although the award was specifically for the Atlantic Edge exhibition, the AHI assessed the entire visitor centre and site. The citation stated that the entire visitor centre was \\"one of the best facilities that the judges had ever seen.\\" Viewing The official Cliffs of Moher Coastal Walk runs for 18 km, from Hag's Head to Doolin, passing the Visitor Centre and O'Brien's Tower, with good viewing throughout, subject to rain or sea fog. There are two paths near the visitor centre, the official one being set back a little for safety, while an unofficial path runs closer to the edge. In July 2016 the so-called Cliff Walk, outside the official Cliffs of Moher amenities, was temporarily closed because of the risk of rock falls. People were warned to stay on the official path further off the cliff edge instead of the unofficial seaside trail. Separate ferry trips also allow tourists to view the cliffs from sea level, and at certain times fixed-wing aircraft from Connemara Airport also provide a viewing opportunity.Aer Arann - scenic flights over the Cliffs of Moher and the Aran Islands Geology and wildlife The cliffs seen from the beach The cliffs consist mainly of beds of Namurian shale and sandstone, with the oldest rocks being found at the bottom of the cliffs. During the time of their formation between 313 and 326 million years ago, a river dumped sand, silt and clay into an ancient marine basin. Over millions of years, the sediments collecting at the mouth of this ancient delta were compacted and lithified into the sedimentary strata preserved in the now-exposed cliffs. The area is considered a geologic laboratory that preserves a record of deltaic deposition in deep water. Individual strata vary in thickness from just a few centimeters to several meters, each representing a specific depositional event in the history of the delta. In aggregate, up to 200 meters of sedimentary rocks are exposed in the Cliffs of Moher. Trace fossils are abundant, comprising two main types: (1) scolicia or worming trails, which are interpreted as feeding trails left by as-yet-unidentified invertebrates, and (2) burrow marks, which are circular features preserved as casts of burrows once occupied by as-yet- unidentified marine creatures. Ripple marks are preserved in some stones. Today the cliffs are subject to erosion by wave action, which undermines the base of support causing the cliff to collapse under its own weight. This process creates a variety of coastal landforms characteristic of erosional coasts such as sea caves, sea stack, and sea stumps. Branaunmore, a 67-meter high sea stack at the foot of the Cliffs of Moher below O'Brien's Tower, was once part of the cliffs, but coastal erosion gradually removed the layers of rock that joined it with the mainland. A large sea arch can also be seen at Hag's Head below the Napoleonic signal tower and many smaller sea arches can be seen from sea level. It is possible to see 300-million-year-old river channels cutting through, forming unconformities at the base of the cliffs. At peak season, there are an estimated 30,000 pairs of birds living on the cliffs, representing more than 20 species. These include Atlantic puffins, which live in large colonies at isolated parts of the cliffs and on the small Goat Island, and razorbills. The site is an Important Bird Area. Downloaded from . A wide range of sea life can also be seen, from grey seals through porpoises, dolphins, minke whales and basking sharks, as well as, occasionally, sunfish. On land, feral goats, foxes, badgers and the Irish hare are found, along with various breeds of farm cattle.Cliffs of Mohers - FAQs - Wildlife Popular culture The Cliffs of Moher have appeared in numerous media. In cinema, the cliffs have appeared in several films, including The Princess Bride (1987) (as the filming location for \\"The Cliffs of Insanity\\"), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009), and Leap Year (2010). The cliffs are mentioned in the Martin Scorsese film Bringing Out the Dead (1999) and are noted in the 2008 documentary Waveriders as the location of a large surfing wave known as \\"Aileens\\". In music, the cliffs have been the scene for music videos, including Maroon 5's \\"Runaway\\", Westlife's \\"My Love\\", and Rich Mullins' \\"The Color Green\\". Most of singer Dusty Springfield's ashes were scattered at the cliffs by her brother, Tom. There is also an Irish fiddle tune called The Cliffs Of Moher. Transport Bus √âireann route 350 links the Cliffs of Moher to several locations: Ennis, Ennistymon, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna, Kinvara and Galway. This service includes a number of journeys each way daily. There is also a privately operated shuttle bus that serves the site from Doolin.

The name derives from the surnames of founders Jem Marsh and Frank Costin. History Marcos was founded in Dolgellau, North Wales, in 1959, by Speedex cars' Jem Marsh with aerodynamicist Frank Costin. Costin had earlier worked on the De Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers and from there he got the idea to use plywood for the chassis. The company moved to a converted mill in Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, in 1963; in 1971 they relocated to a ¬£125,000 purpose-built factory at nearby Westbury. Problems with exporting cars to the US and the move to the expensive new premises led to financial troubles, and in 1971 Marcos went out of business. In July 1971 it was reported that the Rob Walker Group of Companies, a principal dealer, had acquired the stocks and assets and established a new company, Marcos Ltd. The new owners said production would continue, albeit, at least in the short term, only for the UK market, but it is not clear whether any additional cars were built. Although Marcos dealers in the UK had been heavily discounting new cars since the end of 1970, and Motor magazine reported at the time of the collapse that the company's stock of 35 unsold cars in the United States had to be \\"liquidated\\", there may have been a substantial stock of new cars still looking for buyers. One Saturday in June 1972, what was described as \\"a cash jumble sale of Marcos bits ‚Äì prototype and shop soiled components, benches, tools...\\" took place at the \\"old Marcos Cars factory\\" at Westbury. The sale was occasioned by the company's reorganisation and move to a smaller factory. Marsh stayed in the car business, and bought back the rights to the Marcos name in 1976. In 1981 the brand was relaunched with the Marcos V6 Coup√©, which was sold in kit form. The design evolved to incorporate both Rover and Ford V8 engines, as well as moving from kit cars to entirely factory built cars (from 1992), before the company went bankrupt again in 2000. Canadian entrepreneur Tony Stelliga formed Marcos Engineering with Jem Marsh, and revived production in 2002. Race car production was relocated to the Netherlands while road car production moved to Kenilworth, Warwickshire, England. By 2005, most of the designers from near-to-bankrupt TVR had joined the company. On 9 October 2007 it was again announced that Marcos would cease production and go into voluntary liquidation. The design property rights, drawings, jigs and car history files were bought by Marcos Heritage Spares Ltd, owned by Rory MacMath, who had worked closely with Jem Marsh on all the Marcos cars.Marcos Engineering Appoints AdministratorMarcos folds Cars= Marcos GT Xylon, Marcos Luton Gullwing; Marcos fastback GT 1961/1962 Marcos Luton Gullwing at N√ºrburgring, 2007 The first car, the Xylon, which had gullwing doors and a windscreen in four panels, was nicknamed the \\"Ugly Duckling\\". A total of nine, aimed at 750 Motor Club events, were built in 1959 and 1960. For production the body was made less radical but initially retained the gullwing doors. It was powered by a choice of Ford engines varying from 997 cc to 1498 cc and had Standard 10 and Triumph Herald steering and suspension components. Thirty-nine were made up to 1963. In 1961, brothers Dennis Adams and Peter Adams started working with Marcos and introduced several changes to the original design. The Marcos Luton Gullwing and the Spyder were introduced in November 1961. This design was again reworked, becoming the Marcos fastback GT, which was displayed at the London Racing Car Show in 1963. The chassis was fabricated from laminated 3 mm thin sheets of marine plywood, giving the cars a strong monocoque and low weight (the GT was internationally homologated with 475 kg), so they performed well in sportscar competition. Most early Marcos models competed in national and international events. Marcos 1800GT 1970‚Äì1971 Marcos 3-litre, Volvo-engined In 1964 the Marcos 1800 GT was introduced, using the four-cylinder Volvo 1800 cc unit with overdrive gearbox and De Dion rear axle. This was to be the design that would become familiar to sports car enthusiasts for more than 30 years, even though the original plywood chassis would later be replaced by a steel chassis. A variety of other engines, mostly from Ford, but also from Triumph and Volvo became available over the years. In 1966 the GT was changed to Ford engines of originally 1500 cc, later 1650 and 1600 cc, and a coil-sprung live rear axle. In 1968 the Ford Essex V6 engine from the Capri Mk1 was added. In 1969 the plywood chassis was replaced by steel, which shortened production time and saved on cost, and the Ford Essex V4 engine replaced the earlier inline-fours. In 1971 a few cars with the Triumph 2.5-litre straight-six were built, to use up engines from the slow selling Mantis. As the bonnet was a close fit over the engine, this variety of engines resulted in a corresponding variation in the bonnet design, particularly as regards changes designed to clear engine air intakes, often the only external sign of the type of engine fitted. The Ford V6 version achieved over on test and the Volvo-engined model was not far behind it, but the heavy cast-iron engines increased nose-heaviness in comparison to the four-cylinder variants. From 1970 cars for the North American markets received Volvo's inline-six cylinder, 3-liter engines coupled to Borg-Warner automatic transmissions. These have tubular steel space frames, a higher ride height and no headlight covers, to get US road certification. Delays and problems with the federalized cars, together with the development costs of the Mantis, led the company to close its doors for the first time. The Marcos intellectual rights, including jigs, build files and logos were bought by Marcos director Rory MacMath and are now working under the title Marcos Heritage Spares as a restoration and parts company for Marcos Cars (see contact details below for website). Mini Marcos Mini Marcos The front-wheel drive Mini Marcos, designed by Malcolm Newell, was introduced in 1965. With a fibreglass monocoque body, Mini subframes and suspension, and a wheelbase of , it was powered by a transversely mounted Mini A-series engine driving the front wheels. A French-entered example came 15th overall in the 1966 Le Mans race, the only British car to finish. When Marcos stopped making the car in about 1975, another company produced updated versions as the Midas. Cars were also made under licence in South Africa, Australia and Ireland. Revived in 1991 for the Japanese market, production continued until 1995. A total of over 1300 Mini Marcos cars have been sold in kit form and as complete cars. After the demise of Marcos Sales Limited, the Mini Marcos moulds were acquired by Marcos Heritage Spares, who relaunched the car in 2005 as the Marcos Heritage Mk. VI and Mk. VI GT.  Marcos Mantis  Mantis XP in Goodwood Festival of Speed 2010 In 1968 came the first Mantis, the Mantis XP. A racing car designed for the Group 6 Prototype category, it was powered by a mid-mounted Repco V8 engine. Marcos Mantis XP, www.ultimatecarpage.com Retrieved on 15 June 2014 Like earlier Marcos cars it used a plywood monocoque chassis, albeit different from that of the GT. Only one car was made, and its only race was the 1968 1000 km event at Spa, where it retired with electrical problems in heavy rain. Originally Marcos intended to race it in the 1968 Le Mans, but that was postponed from June to September, and by then the car was in America, fitted with a Buick V8 engine (from which the Rover V8 engine was derived). A full restoration of the XP was completed in 2008. Now based in America, it has visited the UK for the Marcos 50th anniversary celebrations and the Goodwood Festival of speed. 1971 Marcos Mantis M70 The next Mantis, the four-seater M70, was launched in 1970 and had a fuel-injected 2.5-litre Triumph TR6 six- cylinder injected engine mated to a four-speed gearbox. The promotional brochure says the styling \\"gives high all round visibility\\", and \\"a low centre of gravity together with an extremely wide track ensures superb roadholding. The luxurious interior seats four in comfort, and the boot, with a capacity of 10 cubic feet, makes the Mantis ideal for the man who is going places and wants to travel in style.\\" Thirty-two were sold before the company went into liquidation in 1972. Autotune acquired the moulds and produced a few more cars in the mid-1980s as the \\"Autotune Mirage\\". Marcos returns Marcos GT Jem Marsh resurrected the Marcos brand in 1981, offering the previous GT cars as kits. Engine options included Ford's 3.0 Essex V6, 2.8 Cologne V6, 1600 Crossflow, 2.0 Pinto and 2.0 V4s, plus Triumph's 2.0 and 2.5 straight sixes. About 130 kits were sold up to 1989.  Marcos Mantula, Spyder and Martina  1989 Marcos Mantula In 1983 the Marcos Mantula was introduced, externally very similar to the old GT, but now powered by a 3.5-litre Rover V8 with a 5-speed gearbox. This alloy engine weighed less than the previous six-cylinder cast-iron units, reducing overall weight to about 900 kg and making the car competitive against other Rover-powered sports cars such as TVR and Morgan. The engine evolved into the Rover Vitesse EFi engine, and later Mantulas were fitted with the 3.9 EFi. In 1986 the model was made available as a convertible, the Marcos Spyder, which would outsell the coup√©s in later production. 1989 saw the introduction of independent rear suspension, together with the Ford Sierra's 7\\" differential and rear disc brakes. The independent suspension allowed a full-width boot and the relocation of the battery and heater/air conditioning. A total of 170 coup√©s and 119 Spyders were produced. Launched in 1991, the Marcos Martina was externally very similar to the Mantula, but with flared front wheel arches. It used the Ford Cortina's 2-litre four-cylinder engine, steering and suspension, and approximately 80 were produced. Originally available as kits or factory-built, the cars were all factory-built from 1992. Production of the Mantula and Martina ceased in 1993.  Marcos Mantara, Mantara GTS and LM cars Marcos Mantara Spyder Marcos Mantara LM500 with 5-litre Rover V8 engine In 1992 Marcos left the kit car business, all cars from this point onwards being factory built, and launched the Marcos Mantara which was sold through dealers in limited numbers. The main difference between the Mantara and the Mantula was the adoption of MacPherson strut front suspension in place of the Triumph suspension and associated trunnions. This change resulted in a wider front track, different bonnet, and flared front arches. The rear wheel arches and rear lights were also changed to give the car a more modern appearance. Power steering was also available for the first time. The Mantara was powered as standard by a 3.9-litre fuel injected Rover V8 or a 4.6-litre Rover V8 as an optional alternative. The Marcos GTS was a version of the Mantara powered by the 2-litre Rover Tomcat engine, on request of the Italian distributor Martes Spider Cars. The top version was the turbo version. The GTS version of the Mantara had a slightly different bonnet incorporating much smoother lines, flared-in headlamps, and a deeper spoiler, which was used on the later Mantaray model. A handful of late Mantara V8's were produced with the same bonnet as the 2.0 litre GTS.\\"Mantara...\\", Marcos Heritage Spares Cor Euser driving a Marcos LM600 at first race of Dutch Supercar Challenge at \\"Preis der Stadt Stuttgart\\" 2011 For a return to GT racing, a range of modified Mantaras was also produced in the LM (Le Mans) versions. To qualify as a production vehicle, a limited number of road going cars were also made. Several versions of the LM were made such as the LM400 (with a Rover 3.9-litre V8 engine), LM500 (Rover 5-litre V8) and LM600 (with 6-litre Chevrolet small-block V8). Only 30 road-going LM cars were ever built, and of these only one was a road- going LM600.  Marcos Mantis  Marcos Mantis Marcos Mantis GT In 1997 the Mantis name was re-used on a 2-seater coup√© or convertible road car based on the LM series powered by the 4.6-litre all-aluminium quad-cam Ford 'Modular' engine producing and capable of . To accommodate the engine the bonnet of the Mantis was significantly remodelled from the previous LM range (that used the Rover V8), and the upper chassis rails in the engine bay were widened. Price for the Mantis was ¬£46,883. In 1998 it was decided to supercharge the engine to produce one of the few British production sports car with over , this being named the Mantis GT. It was first sold in Italy by Martes Spider Cars. Using a Vortech supercharger and intercooler the Mantis GT engine produced , which could accelerate the car from 0‚Äì60 mph in 3.7 seconds. Price for the Mantis GT was ¬£64,331. Production of the Mantis was 51 cars, with 16 being the supercharged GT version (this does not include the Mantis Challenge race cars).\\"Mantis ...\\", Marcos Heritage Spares  Marcos Mantaray  In 1997 the Mantara evolved into the Marcos Mantaray, with the re-styled bonnet from the Mantara GTS and with a new shape rear-end. Mechanically the car was identical to the Mantara. It was offered with 4.0 and 4.6-litre Rover V8 as well as the 2-litre, and 2-litre turbo Rover Tomcat engines. Only 11 were made with the 4.0-litre, and seven with the 4.6-litre engine. Total factory production was 26,\\"The Marcos Range ...\\", Marcos Heritage Spares plus one car in chassis/body component form.  Marcos Marcasite  In 2002, after a break in production caused by bankruptcy, a new company (Marcos Engineering Ltd) was launched with Jem Marsh as vice-chairman, and with the financial backing of Canadian Tony Stelliga, to manufacture the Marcasite TS250 with a 2.5-litre Ford V6 followed in 2003 by the 5-litre Rover V8-powered TS500. The 2002 price of the TS250 was ¬£29,744 +VAT, with options such as air-conditioning (¬£1634), full leather interior (¬£1626) and Hydratrak differential (¬£360). Other unpriced options included an elm or walnut veneer dashboard, and a newly designed hard top.  Marcos TSO  The Marcos TSO was launched in 2004 with a Chevrolet V8 engine in either or versions. The car's components were CAD ,designed in England and its chassis engineering was completed by Prodrive. These vehicles were produced by Tony Stelliga of Marcos. Also in 2004, the 5.7-litre Chevrolet Corvette (LS1) V8 TSO GT was announced, but solely for the Australian market. It was joined in 2005 by the GT2 for the European market. In 2006 Tony Stelliga announced the TSO GTC, a modified version of the current TSO with a racing suspension, racing brakes and a rear diffuser. The car continues on with its Chevrolet-sourced V8, but there was also a Performance Pack available as well. With the extra power from the Performance Pack the TSO GTC accelerated to in 4.1 seconds and to in 8.5 seconds. With the bigger AP Racing brakes, the TSO GTC delivered a 0‚Äì100‚Äì0 time of 12.9 seconds, and the extra power allowed it to accelerate from 50 to in just 2.1 seconds. Its top speed was over . 2 prototypes and 7 production models cars exist. Tony Stelliga's company went into liquidation in October 2007.  Marcos Spirit 220  The Marcos name re-appeared again, together with its original trademark, after owner Tony Brown used the rights to the name in 2010 without permission. The Marcos Intellectual Rights are still owned by Marcos Sportscars Ltd.  Racing history = Wooden wonders  Marcos started out with race cars, with the first Xylon cars being built specifically for the 750 motor club races. Among the drivers were Jackie Stewart, Bill Moss, John Sutton, Jack Gates, John Mitchell and Jackie Oliver, as well as Jem Marsh. The young Jackie Stewart achieved 4 victories in 1961, while Bill Moss managed 9 victories in 10 starts. John Sutton won the 1961 Autosport Championship, and together with Jack Gates and John Mitchell, Marcos won the team prize. When the car went into production as the Luton Gullwing many examples were bought for racing. In 1962 Stephen Minoprio was the Autosport 1000cc GT Champion in his Gullwing ‚Äì setting 7 lap records in the process. The Gullwing in turn evolved into the GT Fastback, also known as the 'Breadvan'. All 18 fastbacks made in 1963 went into racing, and like the Xylon and Gullwing they were FIA homologated in the GT category. However, without the gull wing doors the fastback's were awkward to get in and out of. Drivers included Jackie Oliver, Terry Sanger, and Derek Bell, and Jem Marsh of course. The sales brochure for the Fastback included options for 5 speed gearbox (Hewland), dry sump, 997cc (84 to 88 bhp) and 1148cc (102 to 104 bhp) full race engines, light alloy bellhousing, 72-litre fuel tank (for endurance racing), light weight alloy oil cooler, perspex windscreen (saving 15 lbs). The successor Marcos coup√© road cars were popular track/day cars, and several were raced in the BARC and BRSCC Modsports championships, including Jonathan Palmer taking the 1977 Modsport championship in a V6. Mark Hales also successfully raced a 1967 wooden chassis V6 in the Modsports class. The 1800 Volvo engined cars are accepted for historic racing under FIA Appendix K, where they are very competitive, and there are still wooden chassis Ford-engined cars being raced. The fact that the wooden chassis can take the stresses of racing for so many years shows what a successful design it was.  Mini Marcos  1967 Mini Marcos MkIII The Mini Marcos is also a very successful car on the race track. It made its debut at a rain soaked Castle Combe race track on 25 September 1965. Driven by Geoff Mabbs, it lapped all but one car to win the BRSCC race by 81 seconds at an average of 76 mph. In 1966 a French Mini Marcos, with Marcos support,http://www.minimarcos.org.uk/sport/lm66bd/index.html was the only British car to complete the Le Mans 24-hour race. For the 1967 Le Mans, Marcos entered their own Mini-Marcos (drivers were Marsh and Chris Lawrence). The car was clocked at 141 mph on the Mulsanne Straight in the April test, but failed to finish the race because of an oil pump failure. The same car was more successful in the Kyalami 9-hour race in Nov 1967, when Marsh and Brian Raubenheimer finished 15th, it appeared again in the 1968 race but did not finish. Mini Marcos cars were raced widely,http://www.minimarcos.org.uk/sport/records.html especially as a budget endurance race car, but also in local championships in many countries including Modsports in the UK. Mini-Marcos was also the chosen car for the \\"First Ladies International Race Team\\" (FLIRT), which competed at events such as the Nurburgring 1000 km race in May 1967, where they retired, the Grand Premio del Mugello in July 1967, coming 37th, and the N√ºrburgring 500 km race in September 1967 where two cars were fielded with Jackie Bond-Smith coming in 21st and 4th in class, and Joey Cook retiring.  XP prototype  The XP prototype was intended for the 1968 Le Mans. Raced at Spa as a shakedown test, it was one of many cars that retired with electrical problems in heavy rain. This proved to be its only race. Le Mans was postponed that year and the XP went to America.  Second generation race cars  Mantis Challenge race cars After the company's resurrection in 1981 the emphasis was on road cars, although price lists for the early V8 cars included a competition specification for \\"circuit racing, hill climbs and sprints\\". Competition options include FIA-approved roll-over bar, limited-slip differential, rose- jointed suspension and full harnesses. In October 1993 Marcos unveiled its new competition car and announced a return to GT racing, including Le Mans. Based on the Mantara, the cars were designated LM400, LM500 and LM600. After some successes in the British GT championship in 1994, Marcos won it in 1995, 1996 and 2000. Two cars also competed at Le Mans in 1995. Both suffered electrical faults, one retiring and the other (driven by David Leslie, Fran√ßois Migault, and Jem Marsh's son Chris) finishing second to last, having completed 114 laps fewer than the winning McLaren F1 GTR as its electrical problem stranded it on the Mulsanne Straight for two hours soon after the start. LM600, 2011 Dutch Supercar Challenge Nineteen ninety-eight saw the launch of the Dunlop- sponsored Mantis Challenge, a one-make race series for the coup√© version of the Mantis road car with a dry-sump version of its 4.6-litre quad-cam Ford Modular V8 engine. Complete with FIA roll-cage the cars weighed 950 kg. Entries were few in 1998, and the cars were accepted for the Privilege GT series as GT2, and the French GT series as GT3, winning one of the races in France. In 1999 the field was stronger, and the Dutch Mantis Challenge was also strong, and some races combined both. The 1999 UK series was won by Edward Horner, and the Dutch series by Robert Knook. Thirty-eight Mantis Challenge cars were built, but the series did not continue beyond 1999, after the GT Championship introduced the GT3 class. Many are still raced, including in the British Endurance Championship (Britcar), and at least one has been converted for road use. In 2000, the Marcos racing business was sold to longtime GT sponsor Eurotech, a Dutch engineering firm. By that time, all Marcos racing cars and road car chassis were built in the Netherlands, with road car assembly completed in Westbury by a much-reduced staff. An LM600 driven by Cor Euser competed in the Dutch Supercar Challenge and won the GT Championship in 2002 and 2004, and again in 2009, the 50th anniversary of the founding of Marcos.

It was founded by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, a video game developer who had experience with Sega's AM3 division. After separating with Kenji Sasaki to form AM Annex, Mizuguchi left Sasaki's team to form another division. This studio would later be known as Sega Consumer Development 4 (CS4) and Research and Development #9 (R&D; #9, or AM9) while a department of Sega, before becoming UGA as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sega. AM Annex was created by the separation of a team from Sega AM3, which Mizuguchi described as a move to create a smaller department with a different work environment. Mizuguchi hand-selected the team that would join him at AM Annex, which worked on arcade racing game Sega Touring Car Championship. Mizuguchi later separated from Sega AM5 developer Kenji Sasaki and relocated to Shibuya, where he operated CS4/R&D; #9. Later on, Mizuguchi received direction to create a game that would appeal to a broad spectrum of people, leading to development of Space Channel 5 for the Dreamcast. Along with Sega's other video game development divisions, Mizuguchi's division was separated into a wholly owned subsidiary of Sega in 2000. Mizuguchi gave his new company the name United Game Artists and was installed as CEO. United Game Artists would develop Space Channel 5: Part 2 and Rez under their moniker. In 2003, due to financial issues, United Game Artists was merged into Sonic Team, another of Sega's subsidiary companies. Mizuguchi subsequently left Sega in October of that year. Several games developed by United Game Artists are notable for their reception. Space Channel 5 is frequently credited with being a unique concept that helped bring about music-based video games. Rez is a highly well received title critically. Arcade games from AM Annex such as Sega Rally 2 have remained popular years after their release. History Tetsuya Mizuguchi, founder of AM Annex, which later became United Game Artists Tetsuya Mizuguchi joined Sega in 1990 as a designer of arcade cabinets. Prior to entering the video game industry, Mizuguchi majored in literature at Nihon University's Faculty of Arts. Asked how he chose a career in video games, he explained, \\"I preferred doing something in relation to human senses or entertainment - something more in relation with human nature, a field where I could do some research. ... Unlike the arts, where it is often a matter of taste whether something is good or not, creating good interactive entertainment is more easily definable. I chose Sega because it was using new technology and I was able to study things like human movements.\\" Mizuguchi has expressed that he originally had no interest in making video games and wanted to be involved in other areas of entertainment, including creating theme parks and attractions. During his time at Sega, Mizuguchi developed an interactive 'ride' titled Megalopolis combining then-embryonic 3D polygonal graphics and CGI with the physical experience of Sega's hydraulic 'AS-1' motion simulator. He went on to produce the racing simulator Sega Rally Championship and Manx TT Super Bike. In 1996, while working as a producer for Sega's AM3 division, Mizuguchi met with Hisashi Suzuki, the manager of the division. He and Mizuguchi agreed to create a new department separate from AM3 that would be called AM Annex. Mizuguchi selected the initial team himself, a team of six or seven people that would later grow in number. The first game AM Annex began to develop was Sega Touring Car Championship on the Model 2 arcade board, and Mizuguchi also contributed to Sega Rally 2. According to Hisao Oguchi, later head of AM3, Mizuguchi and developer Kenji Sasaki had departed AM3 with the team of Sega Rally Championship, and Mizuguchi later chose to leave Sasaki after being granted their own AM department and set up development in Shibuya. Sasaki became head of AM5, later renamed Sega Rosso. Logo of Sega Research and Development #9 (R&D; #9) before becoming United Game Artists Mizuguchi's department in Shibuya would be known as Sega Consumer Development 4 (CS4) and Sega Research and Development #9 (R&D; #9), also known as AM9. During this time, the department developed Space Channel 5 for the Dreamcast. Mizuguchi had been tasked by Sega with creating a video game that would have a broad enough appeal to draw in casual female gamers. In order to achieve this, Mizuguchi conducted interviews with girls to find out what they liked. He insists that it is difficult to create a game that appeals to both genders, due to different desires in games. During development of Space Channel 5, Mizuguchi noted one stage in development where the game was \\"cool, but not so fun\\", and so he tried to introduce elements inspired by Stomp. In order to lighten the mood with his staff, Mizuguchi invited a mime artist to visit the department and help his team to loosen up. In 2000, Sega separated its development divisions into subsidiary companies, fully owned by Sega. R&D; #9 became United Game Artists (UGA), and Mizuguchi was installed as its CEO. According to Mizuguchi, the name was one he wanted to use for a video game studio for some period of time. Mizuguchi set a goal with UGA to create games for a worldwide audience, but not with any particular genre in mind. In transitioning from racing games to music-based games, Mizuguchi noted that while racing games were a good way to show off CGI graphics, the release of the Dreamcast gave opportunities to engineer better music, and he wanted to incorporate interactivity with music in games. UGA's next title would be Rez, a musical rail shooter. Mizuguchi initially considered the concept of a video game as an art form after playing Xenon 2 Megablast. Later, while traveling Europe in 1997, Mizuguchi had been taken to the Street Parade in Zurich, during which there was a large electronic dance music concert attended by around 300,000 people. Mizuguchi was taken in by the sights and sounds around him and recognized how this experience was similar to the inspiration that Wassily Kandinsky, a Russian painter, had channeled to \\"[paint] a canvas of the sounds that he saw\\". He saw this tie to his previous ideas and envisioned a game where one would shoot down enemies in time to the beat of music that would put the player into a trance, using a theme of synesthesia, forming the basis of Rez. Mizuguchi and his team began to research how to structure this game, visiting clubs and attending Taiko drumming festivals. On pitching Rez to Sega executives, Mizuguchi has expressed that presenting the game was difficult until management was given the opportunity to try the game, due to difficulty in describing the game's concept in words. Rez was well received upon release,„Éâ„É™„Éº„É†„Ç≠„É£„Çπ„Éà - Rez. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.54. 30 June 2006. as were its re-releases on later consoles. The final release for UGA would be Space Channel 5: Part 2. According to Mizuguchi, despite low sales of the original game, Part 2 was easier to pitch than Rez had been due to there being an established base of fans of the original, as well as the prominence of mobile phones and MTV. Part 2 was designed using real-time graphics instead of the pre-rendered backgrounds of the original game in order to make the game appear more like a movie. Space Channel 5: Part 2 was released in Europe and Japan, but would not make its debut in the United States until the release of the compilation Space Channel 5 Special Edition for the PlayStation 2. In September 2003, Sega performed an internal restructuring of its staff. Among these changes was the dissolution of United Game Artists and the transfer of its members into Sonic Team. The following month, Mizuguchi left Sega. According to Mizuguchi on his decision, \\"At that time, I had two choices, basically. One was to adjust with the company, or the company adjusts to me, but the latter was impossible. So I decided to leave Sega. To me, I think this is a very healthy choice, because I get to do my own games now.\\" Mizuguchi would go on to found Q Entertainment. He has expressed that he would be open to working with Sega again.  Game reception  The titles developed by Mizuguchi's teams at Sega and United Game Artists are renowned for their development and uniqueness. The Sega Rally series retained a level of popularity over a decade after its release, resulting in the later development of Sega Rally 2006. Of the Sega Rally series, Mizuguchi told members of his former staff, \\"it's your game, not mine!\\", giving credit to his team for the game. Mizuguchi also credited his work on racing games with AM Annex as being the best way to show off CGI graphics at the time. Space Channel 5 did not sell well, but has been retrospectively called a \\"highlight\\" on the Dreamcast and described as \\"unlike anything before it.\\" USA Today gave the Dreamcast version all four stars and said it was \\"all about fun, and [Space Channel 5] delivers with a song.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the same version an A- and said that \\"gamers of all ages undoubtedly will want to help Ulala get her groove back ‚Äî if not get their hands on a pair of those boots.\\" IGN's Travis Fahs called Space Channel 5 \\"a product somehow greater than the sum of its parts\\", and that the presentation of Part 2 \\"had been polished to such a degree that it elevated the game to a new level.\\" Rez, in particular, has received much positive feedback and several re-releases. The game received an award from The Agency for Cultural Affairs Media Art Festival in Japan. Writing for Games in 2002, reviewer Thomas L. McDonald described Rez as \\"a game that carves out its own niche: the art-house abstract musical rail- shooter\\", and emphasized the game's differences from traditional rhythm games while noting that \\"the result is awesome, but trying to describe it in words is like trying to sculpt Jell-O. Simply put, it's like nothing you've ever seen before.\\" The game would go on to receive \\"Runner Up\\" in the category of \\"Electronic - Puzzle and Classic\\" in Gamess annual \\"The Games 100\\". In 2009, Edge ranked the game #49 on its list of \\"The 100 Best Games To Play Today\\", calling it \\"Astonishing to watch [and] uniquely absorbing to play\\". In 2012, Rez was listed on Times all-time 100 greatest video games list. Rez would later be re-released in 2007 for the Xbox 360 as Rez HD, which Mizuguchi noted during the show that he \\"always dreamed of a high-def wide screen and very good sound\\", and described the game as \\"100 percent the same game\\" as the original Dreamcast version. After seeing the potential for virtual reality, Mizuguchi created a new development studio, Enhance Games, to redevelop Rez for VR gaming as Rez Infinite for the PlayStation 4. Rez Infinite received widespread acclaim from critics. Review aggregate Metacritic assigned the game a score of 89 out of 100, based on 44 reviews, making Rez Infinite the highest rated PSVR game on the site. The game received unanimous praise for its immersion, sense of place, visual and sound design, and its new level Area X. Despite the age of its previous iterations, many reviewers considered it to be the finest PSVR title to date, and an essential game for anyone owning the device. Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called the game a \\"modern masterpiece\\", and Alexa Ray Corriea of GameSpot considered it to be \\"a new classic\\". Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar thought that the game \\"achieves its full potential with PSVR\\", while Edge summarized \\"Rez Infinite is 15 years old, and the best VR game of 2016.\\" According to Fahs, United Game Artists has a legacy connected with that of the Dreamcast, even though all of their games were ported to the PlayStation 2. He stated that elements of what was UGA can be found in Sonic Team games Feel the Magic: XY/XX and The Rub Rabbits!, and that when it comes to their legacy, \\"UGA turned trite criticisms of 'style over substance' into a badge of honor. Their short run proved just how far dazzling presentation could go.\\" See also *Smilebit NotesReferences Category:Sega divisions and subsidiaries ","title":"United Game Artists"},{"id":"455732","text":"The Society of Fellows is a group of scholars selected at the beginnings of their careers by Harvard University for their potential to advance academic wisdom, upon whom are bestowed distinctive opportunities to foster their individual and intellectual growth.

History Beginning in 1925, Harvard scholars Henry Osborn Taylor, Alfred North Whitehead and Lawrence Joseph Henderson met several times to discuss their frustration with the conditions of graduate study at the university. They believed that in order to produce exceptional research, the most able men required freedom from financial worries, fewer formal requirements, and the liberty to choose whatever object of study attracted them. They soon found an ally in then Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell, who in 1926 appointed a committee, with Henderson as chairman, to study the nature of an institution that might improve the quality of graduate education. The committee recommended the establishment of a Society of Fellows at Harvard, modeled partly on the Fondation Dosne-Thiers in Paris and partly on the Prize Fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, with the hope that such a society would produce not only \\"isolated geniuses, but men who will do the work of the world\\". After years of trying to attract outside donations, Lowell funded the Society himselfhis last major institutional act before his resignation in November 1932. \\"There being no visible source of necessary funds,\\" he later wrote, \\"I gave it myself, in a kind of desperation, although it took nearly all I had.\\" Though it was an open secret that Lowell was the source of the anonymous donation, this was never acknowledged in his presence. After Lowell's death in 1943, the donation was officially made public; it is known as the Anna Parker Lowell Fund in memory of Lowell's wife. The society was officially inaugurated as an alternative to the Ph.D. system with the beginning of the 193334 academic year, granting Fellows freedom to pursue lines of inquiry that transcended traditional academic disciplinary boundaries. Because of the core belief in the importance of informal discussions between scholars in different academic fields, both Senior and Junior Fellows have met for dinner every Monday night during term- time. They are frequently joined by visiting scholars and Fellows are encouraged to bring guests. Originally headquartered in a two-room suite at Eliot House, one of the university's twelve residential colleges, the society was closed to women until 1972, when Martha Nussbaum was selected as the first female Junior Fellow.Nussbaum, Martha C.

A lawyer by profession, Quir√≠no entered politics when he became a representative of Ilocos Sur from 1919 to 1925. He was then elected as senator from 1925‚Äì1931. In 1934, he became a member of the Philippine independence commission that was sent to Washington, D.C., which secured the passage of Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act to American Congress. In 1935, he was also elected to the convention that drafted the 1935 constitution for the newly established Commonwealth. In the new government, he served as secretary of the interior and finance under President Manuel Quezon's cabinet. After World War II, Quir√≠no was elected vice- president in the 1946 election, consequently the second and last for the Commonwealth and first for the third republic. After the death of the incumbent president Manuel Roxas in 1948, he succeeded the presidency. He won the president's office under Liberal Party ticket, defeating Nacionalista vice president and former president Jos√© P. Laurel as well as fellow Liberalista and former Senate President Jos√© Avelino. The Quir√≠no administration was generally challenged by the Hukbalahaps, who ransacked towns and barrios. Quir√≠no ran for president again in 1953 but was defeated by Ramon Magsaysay. Early life and career Elpid√≠o Quir√≠no was born on November 16, 1890 in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. He was the third child of Don Mariano Quebral Quir√≠no of Caoayan, Ilocos Sur and Do√±a Gregoria Mendoza Rivera of Agoo, La Union. Gregoria gave birth to Quir√≠no in the Vigan town jail, where the family lived while Mariano worked as its warden. Quir√≠no was baptized on November 19, 1890. Quir√≠no spent his early years in Aringay, La Union. He studied and graduated from his elementary education to his native Caoayan, where he became a barrio teacher. He received secondary education at Vigan High School, then went to Manila where he worked as junior computer technician at the Bureau of Lands and as property clerk in the Manila police department. He graduated from Manila High School in 1911 and also passed the civil service examination, first-grade. Quir√≠no attended the University of the Philippines in Manila. In 1915, he earned his law degree from the university's College of Law, and was admitted to the bar later that year. He was engaged into the private practice of law. During his early years as an adult he was inducted into the Pan Xenia Fraternity, a professional trade fraternity in the University of the Philippines, in the year 1950. Personal life Quir√≠no was married to Alicia Syqu√≠a (1903‚Äì1945) on January 16, 1921. The couple had five children: Tomas, Armando, Norma, Victoria, and Fe Angela. On February 9, 1945, his wife and three of their children (Armando, Norma and Fe Angela) were killed by Japanese troops as they fled their home during the Battle of Manila. His brother Antonio Quirino was the owner of Alto Broadcasting System, which later merged with Chronicle Broadcasting Network to form the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. His daughter, Victoria, became the youngest hostess of Malaca√±ang Palace, at 16 years old, when Quir√≠no ascended to the presidency on April 17, 1948. She married Luis M. Gonzalez in 1950, who became Philippine ambassador to Spain from 1966‚Äì1971. Congressional career=House of Representatives Quir√≠no was engaged in the private practice of law until he was elected as member of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1919 to 1925, succeeding Alberto Reyes. In 1925 he was succeeded as congressman by Vicente Singson Pablo. Senate Quir√≠no was elected as Senator from 1925 to 1931 representing the First Senatorial District. He then served as Secretary of Finance and Secretary of the Interior in the Commonwealth government. In 1934, Quir√≠no was a member of the Philippine Independence mission to Washington, D.C., headed by Manuel L. Quezon, that secured the passage in the United States Congress of the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act. This legislation set the date for Philippine independence by 1945. Official declaration came on July 4, 1946. Before the Second World War, Quir√≠no was re- elected to the Senate but was not able to serve until 1945. After the war, the Philippine Commonwealth Government was restored. The Congress was likewise re- organized and in the Senate and Quir√≠no was installed was Senate President pro tempore. Vice-presidency 200px Soon after the reconstitution of the Commonwealth Government in 1945, Senators Manuel Roxas, Quir√≠no and their allies called for an early national election to choose the president and vice president of the Philippines and members of the Congress. In December 1945, the House Insular Affairs of the United States Congress approved the joint resolution setting the date of the election on not later than April 30, 1946. Prompted by this congressional action, President Sergio Osme√±a called the Philippine Congress to a three-day special session. Congress enacted Commonwealth Act No. 725, setting the date of the election on April 23, 1946. The act was signed by President Osme√±a on January 5, 1946. Quir√≠no was nominated as Senate President Manuel Roxas' running mate. The tandem won the election. As Vice-President, Quir√≠no was appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Presidency Quir√≠no's five years as president were marked by notable postwar reconstruction, general economic gains and increased economic aid from the United States. Administration and CabinetFirst term (1948‚Äì1949)Accession= Vice-President Elpidio Quirino was inaugurated as the 6th President of the Philippines on April 17, 1948 at the Council of State Room, Executive Building, Malaca√±an Palace. Quirino assumed the presidency on April 17, 1948, taking his oath of office two days after the death of Manuel Roxas. His first official act as the President was the proclamation of a state mourning throughout the country for Roxas' death. Since Quir√≠no was a widower, his surviving daughter, Victoria, would serve as the official hostess and perform the functions traditionally ascribed to the First Lady. =New capital city= On July 17, 1948, the Congress approved Republic Act No. 333, amending Commonwealth Act No. 502, declaring Quezon City the capital of the Philippines in place of Manila.Molina, Antonio. The Philippines: Through the centuries. Manila: University of Sto. Tomas Cooperative, 1961. Print. Nevertheless, pending the official transfer of the government offices to the new capital site, Manila remained to be such for all effective purposes. =HukBaLaHap= The term HukBaLaHap was a contraction of Hukbong Bayan Laban sa mga Hapon (in English: The Nation's Army Against the Japanese Soldiers), members of which were commonly referred to as Huks. With the expiration of the Amnesty deadline on August 15, 1948, the government found out that the Huks had not lived up to the terms of the Quir√≠no-Taruc agreement. Indeed, after having been seated in Congress and collecting his back pay allowance. Luis Taruc surreptitiously fled away from Manila, even as a number of his followers had either submitted themselves to the conditions of the Amnesty proclamation or surrendered their arms. In the face of countercharges from the Huk to the effect that the government had not satisfied the agreed conditions, President Quirino ordered a stepped-up campaign against dissidents, restoring once more an aggressive policy in view of the failure of the friendly attitude previously adopted. =Fireside chats= To bring the government closer to the people, he revived President Quezon's \\"fireside chats\\", in which he enlightened the people on the activities of the Republic by the periodic radio broadcasts from Malaca√±an Palace. =Impeachment attempt= Riding on the crest of the growing wave of resentment against the Liberal Party, a move was next hatched to indict President Quirino himself. Led by Representative Agripino Escareal, a committee composed of seven members of the House of Representatives prepared a five-count accusation ranging from nepotism to gross expenditures. Speaker Eugenio P√©rez appointed a committee of seven, headed by Representative Lorenzo Sumulong to look into the charges preparatory to their filing with the Senate, acting as an impeachment body. Solicitor General Felix Angelo Bautista entered his appearance as defense counsel for the chief executive. Following several hearings, on April 19, 1949, after a rather turbulent session that lasted all night, the congressional committee reached a verdict completely exonerating the President. Quirino waving to the crowd =Romulo becomes President of the UN General Assembly= Great honor was paid the Philippines when, in September 1949, the Fourth General Assembly of the United Nations elected delegate Carlos P. Romulo as its President. The first Oriental to hold the position, Romulo was strongly supported by the Anglo-Saxon bloc, as well as by the group of Spanish-speaking nations, thus underscoring the hybrid nature of the Filipino people's culture and upbringing. =1949 presidential election= Incumbent President Elpidio Quirino won a full term as President of the Philippines after the untimely death of President Manuel Roxas in 1948. His running mate, Senator Fernando L√≥pez won as Vice President. Despite factions created in the administration party, Quirino won a satisfactory vote from the public. It was the only time in Philippine history where the duly elected president, vice president and senators all came from the same party, the Liberal Party. The election was widely criticized as being corrupt,Lana's dirty secrets Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism Retrieved June 14, 2017 with violence and fraud taking place.Hedman, Eva-Lotta & Side, John Philippine Politics and Society in the Twentieth Century: Colonial Legacies Retrieved June 14, 2017 Opponents of Quirino were beaten or murdered by his supporters or the police and the election continues to be seen as corrupt.Taylor, RH The Politics of Elections in Southeast Asia Retrieved June 14, 2017 Second term (1949‚Äì1953) President Elpidio Quirino was inaugurated for his first full term as President of the Philippines on December 30, 1949 at the Independence Grandstand (now Quirino Grandstand), Manila. =Baguio Conference= In May 1950, upon the invitation of President Qurino, through the insistent suggestion of United Nations President Carlos P. Romulo, official representatives of India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Thailand, Indonesia, and Australia met in the city of Baguio for a regional conference sponsored by the Philippines. China and Korea did not attend the conference because the latter did not contemplate the formation of a military union of the Southeast Asian nations. On the other hand, Japan, Indonesia, China, and others were not invited because, at the time, they were not free and independent states. Due to the request of India and Indonesia, no political questions were taken up the conference. Instead, the delegates discussed economic and, most of all, cultural, problems confronting their respective countries. Strangely enough however, the Baguio Conference ended with an official communiqu√© in which the nations attending the same expressed their united agreement in supporting the right to self-determination of all peoples the world over. This initial regional meet held much promise of a future alliance of these neighboring nations for common protection and aid. =HukBaLaHap continued re-insurgence= Quirino's administration faced a serious threat in the form of the communist HukBaLaHap movement. Though the Huks originally had been an anti-Japanese guerrilla army in Luzon, communists steadily gained control over the leadership, and when Quirino's negotiation with Huk commander Luis Taruc broke down in 1948, Taruc openly declared himself a Communist and called for the overthrow of the government. =Peace campaign= With the Communist organization estimated to still have more than 40,000 duly registered members by March 1951, the government went on with its sustained campaign to cope with the worsening peace and order problem. The 1951 budget included the use of a residue fund for the land resettlement program in favor of the surrendered HUKS. The money helped maintain the Economic Development Corps (EDCOR), with its settlements of 6,500 hectares in Kapatagan (Lanao) and 25,000 hectares in Buldon (Cotabato). In each group taken to these places there was a nucleus of former Army personnel and their families, who became a stabilizing factor and ensured the success of the program. Indeed, less than ten percent of the Huks who settled down gave up this new lease in life offered them by the government. To promote the smooth restructuring of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the military were made to undergo a reorganization. Battalion combat teams of 1,000 men each were established. Each operated independently of the High Command, except for overall coordination in operational plans. A total of 26 Battalion Combat Teams were put up. New army units were also established, such was the first Airborne Unit, the Scout Rangers, the Canine Unit, and the Cavalry Unit. These units all showed considerable ability. =1951 midterm election= After a sweep by the Liberals in 1949, many Filipinos doubted the election result. This brought a sweep by the Nacionalistas in the 1951 elections. There was a special election for the vacated Senate seat of Fernando Lopez, who won as Vice President in 1949. The Liberals won no seats in the Senate. =1953 presidential election= Quirino ran for re-election to the presidency with Jos√© Yulo as vice president in 1953 despite his ill health. His Defense Secretary, Ramon Magsaysay, resigned his office and joined the Nacionalista Party. Other prominent Liberalists, like Vice President Fernando L√≥pez, Ambassador Carlos P. Romulo, Senators Tom√°s Cabili and Juan Sumulong, also bolted Quirino's party. On August 22, 1953, Nacionalista and Democratic Parties formed a coalition to ensure Quirino's full defeat. On election day, Quirino was defeated by Ramon Magsaysay with a majority vote of 1.5 million. Domestic policiesEconomy= Upon assuming the reins of government, Quirino announced two main objectives of his administration: first, the economic reconstruction of the nation and second, the restoration of the faith and confidence of the people in the government. In connection to the first agenda, he created the President's Action Committee on Social Amelioration or PACSA to mitigate the sufferings of indigent families, the Labor Management Advisory Board to advise him on labor matters, the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives Financing Administration or ACCFA to help the farmers market their crops and save them from loan sharks, and the Rural Banks of the Philippines to facilitate credit utilities in rural areas. =Social program= Enhancing President Manuel Roxas' policy of social justice to alleviate the lot of the common mass, President Quirino, almost immediately after assuming office, started a series of steps calculated to effectively ameliorate the economic condition of the people. After periodic surprise visits to the slums of Manila and other backward regions of the country, President Quirino officially made public a seven-point program for social security, to wit: #Unemployment insurance #Old-age insurance #Accident and permanent disability insurance #Health insurance #Maternity insurance #State relief #Labor opportunity President Quirino also created the Social Security Commission, making Social Welfare Commissioner Asuncion Perez chairman of the same. This was followed by the creation of the President's Action Committee on Social Amelioration, charges with extending aid, loans, and relief to the less fortunate citizens. Both the policy and its implementation were hailed by the people as harbingers of great benefits. =Agrarian reform= As part of his Agrarian Reform agenda, President Quirino issued on October 23, 1950 Executive Order No. 355 which replaced the National Land Settlement Administration with Land Settlement Development Corporation (LASEDECO) which takes over the responsibilities of the Agricultural Machinery Equipment Corporation and the Rice and Corn Production Administration. =Integrity Board= To cope with the insistent clamor for government improvement, President Quirino created the Integrity Board to probe into reports of graft and corruption in high government places. Vice-President Fernando Lopez was most instrumental, through his courageous expos√©s, in securing such a decision from President Quirino. Foreign policies Photograph of President Truman in the Oval Office, evidently receiving a cane as a gift from the President of the Philippines, Elpidio Quirino, as another man (most likely ambassador Joaqu√≠n Elizalde) looks on. Quirino's administration excelled in diplomacy, impressing foreign heads of states and world statesmen by his intelligence and culture. In his official travels to the United States, European countries, and Southeast Asia, he represented the Philippines with flying colors. During his six years of administration, he with his Foreign Secretary Helen Cutaran Bennett was able to negotiate treaties and agreements with other nations of the Free World. Two Asian heads of state visited Philippines‚ÄìPresident Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China in July 1949 and President Sukarno of Indonesia in January 1951. In 1950, at the onset of the Korean War, Quirino authorized the deployment of over 7,450 Filipino soldiers to Korea, under the designation of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea or PEFTOK. In 1951, the Philippines signed the Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States to deter the threat of communism that existed during the Cold War. The military alliance remains to this day a key pillar of American foreign policy in Asia that also includes defense pacts with Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and Australia. =Korean War= On June 25, 1950, the world was astonished to hear the North Korean aggression against the independent South Korea. The United Nations immediately took up this challenge to the security of this part of the world. Carlos P. Romulo soon stood out as the most effective spokesman for the South Korean cause. On behalf of the government, Romulo offered to send a Philippine military contingent to be under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur, who had been named United Nations Supreme Commander for the punitive expedition. The Philippines, thus, became the first country to join the United States in the offer of military assistance to beleaguered South Korea. President Quirino took the necessary steps to make the Philippine offer. On a purely voluntary basis, the first contingent ‚Äì the Tenth Battalion Combat Team ‚Äì was formed under Col. Azurin, and dispatched to Korea, where its members quickly won much renown for their military skill and bravery. The name of Captain Jose Artiaga, Jr., heroically killed in action, stands out as a symbol of our country's contribution to the cause of freedom outside native shores. Other Philippine Combat Teams successively replaced the first contingent sent, and they all built a name for discipline, tenacity, and courage, until the truce that brought the conflict to a halt. =Quirino- Foster Agreement= By the time of the creation of the integrity board, moreover, the Bell Mission, led by Daniel W. Bell, an American banker, and composed of five members, with a staff of twenty workers, following their period of stay in the Philippines, beginning in July 1950, finally submitted its report on October of the same year. The Report made several proposals, most noteworthy, of which were that the United States on, President Quirino gamely and patriotically, took in the recommendations and sought to implement them. Thus in November 1950, President Quirino and William Chapman Foster, representing the United States Government, signed an agreement by virtue of which the former pledged to obtain the necessary Philippine legislation, in keeping with the Bell Mission Report, while envoy Foster promised the necessary by the same Report. However, much as he tried to become a good president, Quirino failed to win the people's affection. Several factors caused the unpopularity of his administration, namely:Quoted from * Failure of government to check the Huk menace which made travel in the provinces unsafe, as evidenced by the killing of former First Lady Aurora Quezon and her companions on April 28, 1949 by the Huks on the Bongabong-Baler road, Baler, Tayabas (now part of Aurora province); * Economic distress of the times, aggravated by rising unemployment rate, soaring prices of commodities, and unfavorable balance of trade. Post-presidency and death The former tomb of Elpidio Quirino at the Manila South Cemetery Following his failed bid for re- election, Quirino retired from politics to private life in 1953. He offered his dedication to serve the Filipino people, becoming the \\"Father of Foreign Service\\" in the Republic of the Philippines. Quirino died of a heart attack during the leap year day of February 29, 1956 at his retirement house in Novaliches, Quezon City. His remains were initially buried at the Manila South Cemetery. On February 29, 2016, his remains were relocated and reinterred at a special tomb site in the Libingan ng mga Bayani in Taguig, in time for the 60th anniversary of his death. Memorials A memorial to Quirino in Hibiya Park, Tokyo, Japan There are a number of memorials dedicated to Quirino. Quirino Avenue in Manila is named for him, as is the LRT station located there. The Novaliches-Ipo Road where his retirement home is situated was renamed as Quirino Highway. There is also a Quirino Grandstand in Manila's Rizal Park.

It is situated on the Br√∏gger peninsula (Br√∏ggerhalv√∏ya) and on the shore of the bay of Kongsfjorden. The company town is owned and operated by Kings Bay, which provides facilities for permanent research institutes from ten countries. The town is ultimately owned by the Ministry of Climate and Environment and is not incorporated. Ny-√Ölesund has an all-year permanent population of 30 to 35, with the summer population reaching 120. Its facilities include Ny-√Ölesund Airport, Hamnerabben, Svalbard Rocket Range, a port and Ny-√Ölesund Town and Mine Museum, as well as fifteen permanent research stations. It is the northernmost functional civilian settlement in the world. The town was founded in 1917 by Peter Brandal and his mining company, Kings Bay Kull Comp. Initially mining was carried out until 1929, but it was unprofitable for most of the 1920s. There were a series of air expeditions launched from Ny-√Ölesund towards the North Pole. The company was nationalized in 1933 and the town was used for tourism and as a fishing port. Mining resumed for some months in 1941 and then from 1945. After several fatal incidents occurred including a mining accident on 5 November 1962 that killed 21 miners in what became known as the Kings Bay Affair, mining activity was terminated and Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet resigned. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station opened in 1967 and the town gradually transformed into a research settlement. Since 1992, foreign institutions have been permitted to build permanent stations in town. Geography Ny-√Ölesund is located on the north shore of Br√∏ggerhalv√∏ya, a peninsula of Oscar II Land on the island of Spitsbergen. The town is located on the southern shore of Kongsfjorden (literally \\"the King's Bay\\"), a bay on the west coast of Spitsbergen which connects to Forlandssundet of the Greenland Sea. Across from Ny-√Ölesund is the peninsula of Blomstrandhalv√∏ya and the former settlement of Ny-London.Den norske los: 260‚Äì265 As Ny-√Ölesund is not incorporated it lacks any formal area. If the land owned by Kings Bay is used to define the town, it would have an area of , which would encapsulate both the north and south shores of Kongsfjorden. Kings Bay retains ownership of all land in the area, although the mining claims are held by Store Norske.Shears: 12 History The coal deposits at Kongsfjorden were first discovered by Jonas Poole during a whaling expedition in the area in 1610. They did not receive more careful analysis until 1861, when Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand carried out surveys. A Swedish expedition looked into the coal in 1870 and in 1901 Bergen‚ÄìSpitsbergen Kulgrubekompani laid claims to the deposits. Failing to follow up, Ernest Mansfield occupied claims in 1905 and 1906, which were sold to The Northern Exploration Co. Ltd. in 1910. The first test shaft was built in 1909,Hanoa: 9 followed by a hut in 1912.Hanoa: 10 The claims were sold to Peter Brandal of √Ölesund in 1916, who dispatched two ships and sixty men to Kings Bay for the summer of 1916. Arriving on 21 July, they immediately started breaking surface coal. Kings Bay Kull Comp. was founded on 14 December 1916.Hanoa: 16 Thirty people were sent to Kings Bay for the 1917 season, and started construction of a town. By winter buildings, mines, a port and a railway were completed.Hanoa: 15 The town in the late 1910s Sixty-four people stayed the first winter. They were supplemented from May 1918, bringing the summer population to 300. In the following years the town was gradually expanded with additional housing and work buildings.Hanoa: 18 During the first years several names were in use for the settlement, including Kings Bay, Kingsbay and Brandal City. Ny-√Ölesund came into use in the early 1920s and was soon the official name of the settlement.Hanoa: 19 The mining was hit by two strikes in 1919, the first lasting from the summer to October, and the second from November to January 1920. Because of the ice, each year the shipping was limited from May through October.Hanoa: 21 By 1919 the company had fallen into severe financial difficulties. A British take-over was waved off and instead state coal purchasing agreement, effectively subsidies, were enforced.Hanoa: 22 By 1921 the men had started bringing their families, raising the female population to twenty-two and the child population to twenty-three.Hanoa: 23 An improvised school was therefore taken into use.Hanoa: 125 The Geophysical Institute of Troms√∏ established a geophysical station at Kvadehuken in 1920,Hanoa: 44 although it only remained in operation until 1924.Hanoa: 45 Production rose through the 1920, reaching a peak 99,000 tonnes per year.Hanoa: 28 Coal liquefaction was attempted from 1924 to 1927, but proved unprofitable.Hanoa: 38 The labor union, Kings Bay Arbeiderforening, was founded in 1925, although many of the workers had previously ad hoc organized themselves.Hanoa: 134 In 1919 Northern Exploration Company laid pressed that they had claims on Blomstrandhalv√∏ya.Hanoa: 31 The case ended with the Government of Norway buying their claims in 1925, parts of which were sold to Kings Bay.Hanoa: 33 Norge in Ny-√Ölesund on 7 May 1926 Between 1925 and 1928, four attempts were made to reach the North Pole by air from Ny-√Ölesund. One involved flying boats led by Roald Amundsen.Hisdal: 102 Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd made an attempt. Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-√Ölesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. Because of controversies over previous efforts, this is regarded by some as the first successful expedition to the North Pole.Hisdal: 103 After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-√Ölesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.Hisdal: 49 The first fatal mining accident took place in the Ester Mine on 16 December 1926, killing two miners. Gradually a series of smaller accidents took place.Hanoa: 34 The company's lack of profitability caused the government to cease subsidies from 1929.Hanoa: 40 A small guard and maintenance crew was kept in Ny-√Ölesund in the following years.Hanoa: 61 As of 1929 Kings Bay owed NOK 18.6 million to the state and Aalesunds Kreditbank. Thus the state nationalized the company, taking effect on 23 December 1933. A fisheries station opened in 1935, which sold supplies to fishing vessels and carried out steaming of cod liver oil and salting of the cod.Hanoa: 65 As the station was in need of subsidies, it was closed after two years.Hanoa: 66 From 1936 a hotel service targeting tourists opened. Its most elaborate building, Nordpolhotellet, opened on 3 September 1939, although the town was abandoned just days later because of the outbreak of the Second World War.Hanoa: 70 However, this spurred a Norwegian demand for coal, and the town was resettled on 7 May 1941.Hanoa: 73 However, the entire island was evacuated on 29 August, with critical infrastructure blown up.Hanoa: 74 Miners in the Agnes Mine Kings Bay dispatched a crew after the war ended, with the first 90 workers arriving at Ny-√Ölesund on 13 August 1945. They started reconstruction and mining commenced in November.Hanoa: 78 Production reached 61,000 tonnes in 1947.Hanoa: 80 A 4 December 1948 explosion killed fifteen miners.Hanoa: 82 A trial postal air drop took place in 1946, and regular services were provided from 1949.Hanoa: 159 Weather observations were carried out in 1950 to 1953, and again after 1961.Hanoa: 149 The mine flooded on 26 April 1949 and it took half a year to empty it.Hanoa: 83 On 7 January 1951 there was an explosion in the Ester V Mine, killing nine men.Hanoa: 85 On 19 March 1952, yet another explosion took place in the Ester Mine, this time killing nineteen men.Hanoa: 86 These caused several investigations and inquiries, leading to improvements to mining safety.Hanoa: 87 In 1956 Parliament approved a major upgrade to the mining facilities, which would cost NOK 20 million,Hanoa: 96 in the hope that production could reach 200,000 tonnes.Hanoa: 98 In 1956 two brothers, Einar Sverre and Gunnar Sverre Pedersen, through their company Norsk Polar Navigasjon, proposed that an airport be built at Kvadehussletta, on the outer- most point of Br√∏ggerhalv√∏ya.Tamnes: 15 It was met by opposition from both Norwegian and Soviet authorities and no permits were granted,Tamnes: 23 even though they pursued the case for a decade.Tamnes: 45 By 1959 Ester I was depleted and the railway was closed‚Äîtransport having been taken over by trucks, and production remained low during the late 1950s.Hanoa: 105 An explosion on 5 November 1962 killed 21 miners. Two investigations were carried out and the issue became a heated political debate.Hanoa: 167 In what became the Kings Bay Affair, Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet was ultimately forced to resign in August 1963,Hanoa: 171 and all mining in Ny-√Ölesund was terminated from 5 November 1963. For the meanwhile, Kings Bay was to retain the equipment and facilities in case later technological development would allow for safer mining operations.Hanoa: 171 The first research establishment came in 1967, when Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was opened to communicate with the European Space Research Organization's satellites. The Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research took over daily management of Ny-√Ölesund until the telemetry station was closed in 1974.Hanoa: 183 The station resulted in the construction of Ny-√Ölesund Airport, Hamnerabben,Hanoa: 185 and resulted in about thirty employees.Hanoa: 178 utilidors to avoid permafrost The Norwegian Polar Institute established a scientific station in Ny-√Ölesund in 1966, moving their ionosphere measurement station from Isfjord Radio.Hanoa: 177 An early scientific agent was the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which has conducted air research in Ny-√Ölesund since the mid-1970s.Hanoa: 211 Gradually there was increased interest in research in Ny-√Ölesund. In the first years a series of universities sent summer expeditions.Hanoa: 202 Kings Bay also generated revenue from selling fuel, supplies and air transport to shrimp fishers.Hanoa: 206 By 1977 Kings Bay stuck a deal by the then state-owned Store Norske to sell all its claims, although it kept the property rights around Ny-√Ölesund.Hanoa: 181 During the early 1980s a plan for cultural heritage management was developed, which included the renovation of several older houses. In 1992 nearly the entire town was listed.Hanoa: 210 Construction of the Zeppelin Station commenced in 1988 and in 1990 Kings Bay moved its administration from Oslo to Ny-√Ölesund. From 1992 the government allowed international research institutions to establish stations in Ny- √Ölesund,Thuesen: 171 and thus several institutes built stations the early 1990s.Hanoa: 214 This was matched by Kings Bay, who invested in increased capacity, including dorms, a new dock and better communications.Thuesen: 173 By 1996 there were over one hundred research projects in Ny-√Ölesund.Thuesen: 183  Climate  Ny-√Ölesund has a polar climate (K√∂ppen ET). However, winter temperatures are very mild compared to other locations with the same classification because of the North Atlantic Drift. Research The gondola which runs up Zeppelinfjellet to Zeppelin VLBI radio telescope. Ny-√Ölesund is host to sixteen permanent research stations run by agencies from ten countries. In addition there are several institutions which carry out permanent research without having established their own stations. Most research is centered around environmental and earth sciences, taking advantage of the town's latitude, close access to pristine nature and relatively mild climate. Compared to other locations at such a latitude, Ny-√Ölesund provides a well-developed infrastructure in terms of facilities, laboratories, access and communication. The entire town remains owned and operated by Kings Bay, which provides services to visiting scientists. Representatives for the participating institutes meet in the Ny-√Ölesund Science Managers Committee (NySMAC) twice per year. NySMAC's main goals are to distribute information on existing research and plan future research. The Svalbard Science Forum (SSF) is an agency which acts as an information and coordination facilitator for research throughout Svalbard. Based in Longyearbyen, it is chaired by the Research Council of Norway. Among SSF's tasks is the management of the Research in Svalbard (RiS) database, which contains information on all previous and ongoing research on the archipelago. Kings Bay participates in SSF and requires all researchers to register their projects with RiS. The Americans do have a presence in the form of a National Science Foundation funded group known as Svalbard REU which conducts research on the surrounding glaciers annually. The following is a list of all currently running, permanent research stations in Ny-√Ölesund. It states the station's name, the institute operating it, the nationality, the year the station was established, and the nature of the research carried out. {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" + List of research stations - ! scope=col  Station ! scope=col  Institution ! scope=col  Nationality ! scope=col  Est. ! scope=col  Research - ! scope=row  Amundsen‚ÄìNobile  National Research Council of Italy  Italy  2009  Atmospheric - ! scope=row  Arctic  University of Groningen  Netherlands  1995  Ecology and others - ! scope=row  Arctic Yellow River  Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration  China  2004  Environment, glaciology, meteorology, marine ecosystems, meteorology, space‚ÄìEarth measurements - ! scope=row  British  British Antarctic Survey  United Kingdom  1991  Earth and life sciences - ! scope=row  Corbel  French Polar Institute Paul-√âmile Victor  France  1963  Atmospheric sciences, hydrology, glaciology - ! scope=row  Dasan  Korea Polar Research Institute  South Korea  2002  Atmospheric chemistry glacial and periglacial geomorphology and hydrology - ! scope=row  Dirigibile Italia  National Research Council of Italy  Italy  1997  Environment and climate - ! scope=row  Himadri  National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research  India  2008  Atmospheric sciences, marine ecosystems and pollution - ! scope=row  Japanese  National Institute of Polar Research  Japan  1990  Atmospheric physics, glaciology, meteorology, oceanography and terrestrial biology - ! scope=row  Koldewey  Alfred Wegener Institute  Germany  1991  Atmospheric physics, biology, chemistry and geology.

The coalfields are about wide in the east‚Äìwest orientation, and about wide in the north‚Äìsouth direction. There are six seams, located at a ten to twenty degree angle towards the surface. The seam thickness varies from a few centimeters (about an inch) to . The varying thickness increased the complexity of mining. From the top the seams are named Ragnhil, Josefine, Otelie, Advokat, Sofie and Ester. Most of the latter three are located below sea level. Each shaft was named for the seam it connected to. The area has further been subdivided into areas: Eastern, Agnes, Eastern Center, Western Center, Western and Lagoon. Only three have seen production, the Agnes, Eastern Center and Western Center.Hanoa: 57 The coal layers are part of a Tertiary formation created 65 million years ago. It is classified as bituminous coal and cannel coal, with a high petroleum content (16‚Äì25 percent) and high sulphuric contents (2 percent). This is the same formation as the coal mines in Longyearbyen and Sveagruva, but the Ny-√Ölesund layer has been shifted in relation to these. Transport and communications A Lufttransport Dornier Do 228 landing at Ny-√Ölesund Airport, Hamnerabben Ny-√Ölesund has a road network which connects the buildings at the settlement, but this network does not extend beyond the settlement. Off-road motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter‚Äîboth for commercial and recreational activities.Umbriet (1997): 63‚Äì67 Ny-√Ölesund Harbour is operated by Kings Bay. In addition to serving the research community, it is open to commercial and recreational vessels. It has one large berth which is International Ship and Port Facility Security Code compliant and is commonly used by cruise ships. To reach the Zeppelin Station, located at above mean sea level, there is an aerial tramway which runs up Zeppelinfjellet. Ny-√Ölesund Airport, Hamnerabben consists of a single long and wide gravel runway, located northwest of the settlement. It features a apron and aerodrome flight information service, but lacks a terminal and hangar facilities. Kings Bay charters Lufttransport to fly two to four weekly flights using a Dornier Do 228 aircraft to Svalbard Airport, Longyear. Tickets are only available after permission from Kings Bay. Svalbard Rocket Range is a launch site for sounding rockets. Owned by And√∏ya Rocket Range, its high latitude makes it well-suited for launching rockets to investigate Earth's magnetic field. It is the world's northernmost launch site. From the implementation of the Svalbard Undersea Cable System in 2003 Ny-√Ölesund had a twin 155 megabits per second microwave connection to Longyearbyen. Two redundant fiber pairs were laid in 2014, increasing capacity to 10 gigabits per second. The fiber line is owned by Uninett and cost NOK 90 million (roughly ‚Ç¨9.2 million) to install. The very-long-baseline interferometry station at Hamnerabben is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in certain frequencies. Thus there is enforced a exclusion zone for devices transmitting at between 2.1 and 2.5 GHz. The ban includes mobile telephones, Bluetooth, Wi- Fi and other wireless devices. Telenor Maritim Radio operates a VHF maritime radio transmitted in Ny-√Ölesund, which is remotely controlled from Bod√∏ Radio. Environment Ny-√Ölesund is located in a high-Arctic ecosystem within the tundra zone. It sits amid the richest fauna and flora areas of Svalbard, especially along the rim of Kongsfjord and particularly in its innermost parts. Some of the cliffs are heavily populated by birds; Ny-√Ölesund is the archipelago's richest area for birds, especially waders. The Svalbard ptarmigan is the sole bird to winter. The vegetation is poor and vulnerable, mostly consisting of lichen. Mammals in the area include the Svalbard reindeer, the Arctic fox and the polar bear.Brekke: 6 All people in the settlement must carry rifles because of the bears, and all doors in town remain unlocked for the sake of people seeking cover in the event of an attack. There are three protected areas in the vicinity: Blomstrandhamna Bird Sanctuary, Kongsfjorden Bird Sanctuary and Ossian Sars Nature Reserve. The climate is mild for its northern latitude, due to the North Atlantic Current which flows northwards from mainland Norway up the west coast of Spitsbergen. It also receives heat from the predominant high pressure fronts which bring warm air from the Atlantic to the Barents Sea. The town has its lowest temperatures during March, at an average and a high average of during July. The sun does not set from 18 April to 24 August (midnight sun) and does not rise from 25 October to 17 February (polar night). But there is no nautical twilight between December 11 to December 30, it only has 24 hour of darkness called astronomical twilight. The site is sufficiently isolated that it can be used to measure the background pollution levels in the high Arctic troposphere.Shears: 18 Image gallery File:Ny-√Ölesund 2013 06 07 2305 (10178252673).jpg File:Ny-√Ölesund 2013 06 07 2313 (10178365155).jpg File:Ny- √Ölesund 2013 06 07 2304 (10178237266).jpg File:Ny-√Ölesund 2013 06 07 3602 (10178426083).jpg File:Kongsfjorden 60.JPG File:Ny-√Ölesund 2013 06 07 2328 (10178897465).jpg See also *List of research stations in the Arctic *The Ny-√Ölesund Symposium ReferencesBibliography    * * External links * Category:Populated places in Svalbard Category:Company towns in Norway Category:Populated places established in 1916 Category:1916 establishments in Norway ","title":"Ny-√Ölesund"},{"id":"455750","text":"The British Columbia Unity Party was a political party in British Columbia, Canada. The party was founded as an attempted union of five conservative parties: the Reform Party of British Columbia, the British Columbia Social Credit Party, the British Columbia Conservative Party, the British Columbia Party, and the Family Coalition Party of British Columbia. Members from the first four parties joined with the Family Coalition Party to refound the Family Coalition Party as the BC Unity Party on January 10, 2001. The party was formed to present a united conservative option to voters in opposition to the centre-right BC Liberals and the centre-left New Democratic Party (NDP). History The party was founded in January 2001. Five months after the party was founded, it nominated 56 candidates across the province for the May 16, 2001 provincial elections. During the election campaign, BC Unity positioned itself as a solidly conservative party, in contrast to the BC Liberals. Despite being included in the leaders debate, along with Premier Dosanjh and Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell the unpopularity of the NDP government was so great that most conservative-minded voters chose to vote for the BC Liberals, rather than split the right-of-centre vote once again. The party received only 3.2% of the vote (51,426). On September 1, 2004, BC Unity and the British Columbia Conservative Party announced an agreement-in-principle for the two parties to merge under the Conservative Party name. The deal, however, fell through after BC Conservative Leader Barry Chilton withdrew. At the Unity annual general meeting held on September 24 and 25, 2004 in Coquitlam, the BC Unity Party was presented with another proposal of merger by the Conservatives. The Unity delegates did not accept this proposal and instead, affirmed the original agreement-in-principle. This action was not accepted by the BC Conservatives and the merger failed. BC Unity leader Chris Delaney blamed himself for the failure of the merger and resigned. Many BC Unity members left the party prior to the September 2004 annual general meeting in order to join the Conservatives and to influence them into accepting the agreement-in-principle. When the merger failed, these former members did not return to the Unity party. In 2005, BC Unity named Daniel Stelmacker as its interim leader. Stelmacker had been a party candidate for the Nanaimo- Parksville electoral district in the 2001 election. In 2005, Stelmacker was the party's sole nominated candidate for the 2005 provincial election, running in the Skeena riding. He won 224 votes, 1.74% of the total for the riding. The party held its last annual general meeting on Saturday, October 29, 2005, in Maple Ridge, British Columbia. On November 29, 2006, the party issued a news release to announce that it was looking for a new leader and for candidates for the 2009 provincial election. On January 26, 2008, the BC Unity Party Board decided to poll the membership regarding the merger of the Party with the BC Conservatives or its de-registration. A General Meeting was called for Saturday March 29, 2008 in Surrey. The poll returns indicated 4:1 ratio in favour of a merger with the BC Conservative Party, and the General Meeting confirmed this motion. The BC Conservative Party accepted the former BC Unity Party memberships at their April 19, 2008 executive meeting in Abbotsford. The BC Unity Party de-registered five registered constituency associations, and planned to complete the merger and de-registration process before the BC Conservative Party AGM in Kamloops on Saturday June 7, 2008.

Estremera, who is an albino, is nicknamed -and billed- as \\"El Cano\\" (\\"The Light-Colored Haired One\\"), a word which is commonly used in Puerto Rico to refer to people of light complexion. He is arguably the most famous albino in the Caribbean country, and as such, has raised public awareness of the condition's traits and limitations (such as limited vision, which Estremera openly acknowledges, even in the occasional song). Cano Estremera developed his talent as a singer while residing in Residencial Las Casas, a public housing complex in the area of Santurce, not far from Trastalleres, where Daniel Santos, Andy Monta√±ez and Ossie Ocasio were raised. As H√©ctor Lavoe did before him, Estremera acknowledges Puerto Rican j√≠baro country singers as a strong influence. He developed a reputation for being a fast and clever improviser, in the same vein as Marvin Santiago, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Oscar D'Le√≥n and other salsa singers who could improvise dozens of soneos (improvisations within a call‚Äìresponse format) on the spot. Later in his life Estremera would use the title \\"Due√±o del soneo\\" (\\"Owner of the Soneo\\") as a marketing concept, emphasizing his prowess as an on-the-spot improviser. In 1978, Estremera joined Bobby Valent√≠n, among other replacements to Valentin's band -namely Santiago and former Sonora Ponce√±a singer Luiggi Texidor. Estremera recorded six albums before stating his own band in 1984. He was the lead singer on many of the best selling hits by Valent√≠n's band, particularly the band's best seller ever, \\"La boda de ella\\" (\\"Her Wedding\\"), written by Roberto Angler√≥. Estremera began touring all over the United States by 1989. He enjoyed wild success in Puerto Rico as well as in Brazil and Peru, among other places. His best known hit as a solo artist is \\"El Toro\\" (\\"The Bull\\"), a humorous take on infidelity (and, in one line, about his low vision). Estremera has participated in \\"soneo\\" battles with other salsa singers, most famously with Domingo Qui√±ones. He has also faced two incidents where he has been blacklisted from venues in Puerto Rico for using profanity onstage. As a result, he often polls audiences before addressing specific subjects onstage. A 2003 CD release celebrated his twenty years in the music industry.  Health Problems  It was announced on 25 September 2018, that Estremera was battling pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that is common among albino people. On 2 November 2018 Mr Estremera underwent a dual lung transplant operation at a Philadelphia Hospital.

On June 15, 2006, the Armenian Parliament passed the law on the state coat of arms of Armenia. It consists of an eagle and a lion supporting a shield. The coat of arms combines new and old symbols. The eagle and lion are ancient Armenian symbols dating from the first Armenian kingdoms that existed prior to Christ. These symbols are found on the Armenian Highland from times immemorial. Numerous Armenian dynasties such as Artaxiad, Arsacid, Bagratuni and Rubenid, used these symbols as their royal insignia. Like other post-Soviet republics whose symbols do not predate the October Revolution, the current emblem retained one component of the Soviet one such as the Mount Ararat on the shield. Prior to 1992, Armenia had an emblem similar to all other Soviet Republics. History Coat of Arms of the First Republic of Armenia 1918. The coat of arms of Transcaucasian SFSR 1922‚Äì1936. Soviet Armenia and the independent Republic of Armenia 1936‚Äì1992. Coat of arms of the First Republic of Armenia The present-day Armenian coat of arms has its origins with the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia in 1918. In that year, an early variation of the coat of arms was adopted. The symbols on this earlier version were placed in a slightly different order and the eagle and lion have their tongues out, giving them a more menacing look. Only Mount Ararat (along with Little Ararat) are depicted while Noah's Ark is absent. The coat of arms was designed by architect and member of the Russian Academy of Fine Arts Alexander Tamanian and artist Hakob Kojoyan. Transcaucasian SFSR In 1922, Armenia was incorporated into Transcaucasian SFSR with Georgia and Azerbaijan. The coat of arms of the Transcaucasian SFSR was adopted by the government of the Transcaucasian SFSR. It is uncertain when exactly it was adopted. It incorporates designs from each of the three major groups that combined in the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Armenians, Azeri and Georgians, and unusually features Islamic art and communist elements side by side. The latticework in the star itself bespeaks the former coat of arms of Georgia from 1918‚Äì1921 and adopted again from 1991‚Äì2004; the crescent moon represents the Muslim Azeris, on a background depicting the national symbol of the Armenians, Mount Ararat. Soviet coat of arms In 1937, a new coat of arms was adopted. Like the coat of arms of the first independent republic, this one prominently featured Mount Ararat along with the Soviet hammer and sickle and red star behind it. The inclusion of Mount Ararat brought objections from Turkey because the mountain is part of its territory. The Kremlin retorted that, although the Turkish symbol was the crescent, surely it did not mean that they laid claim to the moon.Louis, Victor and Jennifer. The Complete Guide to the Soviet Union. New York, 1976. p. 98 The Soviet Union broke apart in 1991 and Armenia thus became an independent republic. In 1992, a slightly modified version of the coat of arms of the first republic was adopted and has remained in place ever since. Symbolism=Shield The shield itself consists of many components. In the center is a depiction of the Mount Ararat with Noah's Ark sitting atop it. According to tradition, the ark is said to have finally rested on the mountain after the great flood. Ararat is considered the national symbol of Armenia and thus is of principal importance to the coat of arms. Surrounding Mount Ararat are symbols of old Armenian dynasties. In the lower left portion of the shield, there are two eagles looking at each other, symbolizing the length of the Armenian territory during the reign of the Artaxiad Dynasty that ruled from the second century B.C. to the beginning of the Christian era. In the upper left portion, there is a lion with a cross, the emblem for the Bagratuni Dynasty that ruled during the Middle Ages, between the 9th and 11th centuries. Under this dynasty, Armenia blossomed culturally, making its capital, Ani, one of the most important cultural, social and commercial centers of its time. The Bagratuni kingdom was destroyed by the Byzantine Empire's encroachment and by Seljuk conquests in the 11th century. In the upper right portion, there is a two- headed eagle, the emblem of the first dynasty to reign over Christian Armenia, the Arsacid Dynasty, which ruled from the first century to 428. Tiridates III made Armenia the first country to adopt Christianism as official religion in 301. In the lower right portion, there is a lion with a cross, the emblem of the Rubenid dynasty. This dynasty reigned in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, a state that expanded and prospered during the 12th and 13th centuries, until the Mamelukes eventually conquered it in 1375. Eagle and Lion The eagle supports the shield on the left side of the coat of arms, while the lion on the right side. The eagle was the symbol of the Artaxiad Dynasty and later on the symbol of the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. It holds the Artaxiad Dynasty's branch of the shield. Whereas, the lion was the symbol of the Bagratuni Dynasty and later on the symbol of the Rubenid Dynasty. It holds the Rubenid Dynasty's branch of the shield. The eagle and the lion are a common theme for civilizations on the Armenian Highland. As such they have been represented throughout various Armenian dynasties. Both of these animals were chosen because of their power, courage, patience, wisdom, and nobility in animal kingdom.

This is in accordance with article 193 (originally 125) of the Belgian Constitution: The Belgian nation takes red, yellow and black as colours, and as state coat of arms the Belgian lion with the motto UNITY MAKES STRENGTH. A royal decree of 17 March 1837 determines the achievement to be used in the greater and the lesser version, respectively. History The newly independent Kingdom of Belgium decided to base its coat of arms and flag on the symbols used by the short-lived United Belgian States. These came into being after the Southern Netherlands threw off Austrian rule. It existed as an independent polity from January to December 1790. The Duchy of Brabant had taken the lead in the so-called Brabant Revolution, the insurrection against Emperor Joseph II, and afterwards dominated the United Netherlandish States. Therefore, the Lion of Brabant (sable, a lion rampant or, armed and langued gules) came to stand for the entire federation. This was not without precedent. In the course of the Dutch Revolt the provinces rebelling against the rule of King Philip II adopted a common seal in 1578 showing the Leo Belgicus wearing a crown and holding a sword and a sheaf of arrows. The crown stood for sovereignty, the sword for the war against Spain and the arrows for the concord and unity among the rebellious provinces. At first the lion of the (Dutch) Republic of the United Provinces had the Brabant colours or on sable. It was only when most of Brabant was reconquered by Spain in the 1580s and Holland came to dominate the Republic, that the colours of the Dutch lion (or and gules) became the definitive tinctures of the arms of the United Provinces. The Dutch Revolt likewise provided the motto \\"Unity Makes Strength\\". The inscription of the seal of 1578 reads (through unity small things grow), a quote taken from Sallust's Jugurthine War. Soon Dutch sources used the translation . The United States of Belgium of 1790 used the Latin version . Their motto was in turn taken over and translated into French by the Kingdom of Belgium in 1831. It was only in 1958 that it was decided that the official Dutch translation should read . Variants=Greater version The shield is emblazoned: Sable, a lion rampant or, armed and langued gules. It is surmounted by a helmet with raised visor, with mantling or and sable and the royal crown in lieu of a crest. Behind the shield are placed a hand of justice and a sceptre with a lion. The grand collar of the Order of Leopold surrounds the shield. Two lions guardant proper support the shield as well as a lance with the national colours black, yellow and red. Underneath the compartment is placed the motto in French or Eendracht maakt macht in Dutch, or Unity Is Strength in English. The riband of the motto is red, with black stripes on either side. The lettering is golden. Since the Royal Decree of 1837 never received an official translation, the use of the Dutch version of the motto is customary rather than official. The whole is placed on a red mantle with ermine lining and golden fringes and tassels, ensigned with the royal crown. Above the mantle rise banners with the arms of the nine provinces that constituted Belgium in 1837. They are (from dexter to sinister) Antwerp, West Flanders, East Flanders, Li√®ge, Brabant, Hainaut, Limburg, Luxembourg and Namur. The greater arms are used only rarely. They adorn the great seal that is affixed to laws and international treaties. Since the province of Brabant was split into Flemish Brabant, Walloon Brabant and Brussels in 1995, the greater arms no longer reflect the present territorial divisions of the state. The changes made to the arms of the Flemish provinces as a result of this decision are not reflected in the great seal either. Lesser version The lesser coat of arms (as used by the Belgian federal government, on passport covers and the official sites of the monarchy and of the government) consists of the shield, the royal crown, the crossed sceptres, the collar of the Order of Leopold and the motto.  Royal versions  A Royal Decree published on 19 July 2019 and signed on the same day, by King Philippe, reinstated the Saxonian escutcheon in all the royal versions of the family's coat of arms. The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of King Philippe and Queen Mathilde to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle. The king also added translations of the motto into the three official languages of Belgium, to reflect his wish \\"to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians\\". The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to the Royal versions of the coat arms which removed the armorial bearings of Saxony during the First World War. ;Reigning King's or Queen's (Royal Arms) version Sable, a lion rampant or, armed and langued Gules charged on the shoulder with an escutcheon of the House of Wettin.

In physics, a rigid body (also known as a rigid object (link: )) is a solid body in which deformation is zero or so small it can be neglected. The distance between any two given points on a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external forces exerted on it. A rigid body is usually considered as a continuous distribution of mass. In the study of special relativity, a perfectly rigid body does not exist; and objects can only be assumed to be rigid if they are not moving near the speed of light. In quantum mechanics a rigid body is usually thought of as a collection of point masses. For instance, in quantum mechanics molecules (consisting of the point masses: electrons and nuclei) are often seen as rigid bodies (see classification of molecules as rigid rotors). Kinematics= Linear and angular position  The position of a rigid body is the position of all the particles of which it is composed. To simplify the description of this position, we exploit the property that the body is rigid, namely that all its particles maintain the same distance relative to each other. If the body is rigid, it is sufficient to describe the position of at least three non- collinear particles. This makes it possible to reconstruct the position of all the other particles, provided that their time-invariant position relative to the three selected particles is known. However, typically a different, mathematically more convenient, but equivalent approach is used. The position of the whole body is represented by: # the linear position or position of the body, namely the position of one of the particles of the body, specifically chosen as a reference point (typically coinciding with the center of mass or centroid of the body), together with # the angular position (also known as orientation, or attitude) of the body. Thus, the position of a rigid body has two components: linear and angular, respectively.In general, the position of a point or particle is also known, in physics, as linear position, as opposed to the angular position of a line, or line segment (e.g., in circular motion, the \\"radius\\" joining the rotating point with the center of rotation), or basis set, or coordinate system. The same is true for other kinematic and kinetic quantities describing the motion of a rigid body, such as linear and angular velocity, acceleration, momentum, impulse, and kinetic energy.In kinematics, linear means \\"along a straight or curved line\\" (the path of the particle in space). In mathematics, however, linear has a different meaning. In both contexts, the word \\"linear\\" is related to the word \\"line\\". In mathematics, a line is often defined as a straight curve. For those who adopt this definition, a curve can be straight, and curved lines are not supposed to exist. In kinematics, the term line is used as a synonym of the term trajectory, or path (namely, it has the same non-restricted meaning as that given, in mathematics, to the word curve). In short, both straight and curved lines are supposed to exist. In kinematics and dynamics, the following words refer to the same non-restricted meaning of the term \\"line\\": * \\"linear\\" (= along a straight or curved line), * \\"rectilinear\\" (= along a straight line, from Latin rectus = straight, and linere = spread), * \\"curvilinear\\" (=along a curved line, from Latin curvus = curved, and linere = spread). In topology and meteorology, the term \\"line\\" has the same meaning; namely, a contour line is a curve. The linear position can be represented by a vector with its tail at an arbitrary reference point in space (the origin of a chosen coordinate system) and its tip at an arbitrary point of interest on the rigid body, typically coinciding with its center of mass or centroid. This reference point may define the origin of a coordinate system fixed to the body. There are several ways to numerically describe the orientation of a rigid body, including a set of three Euler angles, a quaternion, or a direction cosine matrix (also referred to as a rotation matrix). All these methods actually define the orientation of a basis set (or coordinate system) which has a fixed orientation relative to the body (i.e. rotates together with the body), relative to another basis set (or coordinate system), from which the motion of the rigid body is observed. For instance, a basis set with fixed orientation relative to an airplane can be defined as a set of three orthogonal unit vectors b1, b2, b3, such that b1 is parallel to the chord line of the wing and directed forward, b2 is normal to the plane of symmetry and directed rightward, and b3 is given by the cross product b_3 = b_1 \\\\times b_2 . In general, when a rigid body moves, both its position and orientation vary with time. In the kinematic sense, these changes are referred to as translation and rotation, respectively. Indeed, the position of a rigid body can be viewed as a hypothetic translation and rotation (roto-translation) of the body starting from a hypothetic reference position (not necessarily coinciding with a position actually taken by the body during its motion).  Linear and angular velocity  Velocity (also called linear velocity) and angular velocity are measured with respect to a frame of reference. The linear velocity of a rigid body is a vector quantity, equal to the time rate of change of its linear position. Thus, it is the velocity of a reference point fixed to the body. During purely translational motion (motion with no rotation), all points on a rigid body move with the same velocity. However, when motion involves rotation, the instantaneous velocity of any two points on the body will generally not be the same. Two points of a rotating body will have the same instantaneous velocity only if they happen to lie on an axis parallel to the instantaneous axis of rotation. Angular velocity is a vector quantity that describes the angular speed at which the orientation of the rigid body is changing and the instantaneous axis about which it is rotating (the existence of this instantaneous axis is guaranteed by the Euler's rotation theorem). All points on a rigid body experience the same angular velocity at all times. During purely rotational motion, all points on the body change position except for those lying on the instantaneous axis of rotation. The relationship between orientation and angular velocity is not directly analogous to the relationship between position and velocity. Angular velocity is not the time rate of change of orientation, because there is no such concept as an orientation vector that can be differentiated to obtain the angular velocity.  Kinematical equations = Addition theorem for angular velocity  The angular velocity of a rigid body B in a reference frame N is equal to the sum of the angular velocity of a rigid body D in N and the angular velocity of B with respect to D: : {}^\\\\mathrm{N}!\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{B} = {}^\\\\mathrm{N}!\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{D} + {}^\\\\mathrm{D}!\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{B}. In this case, rigid bodies and reference frames are indistinguishable and completely interchangeable.  Addition theorem for position  For any set of three points P, Q, and R, the position vector from P to R is the sum of the position vector from P to Q and the position vector from Q to R: : \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\mathrm{PR} = \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\mathrm{PQ} + \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\mathrm{QR}.  Mathematical definition of velocity  The velocity of point P in reference frame N is defined as the time derivative in N of the position vector from O to P: : {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\mathrm{P} = \\\\frac{{}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}(\\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\mathrm{OP}) where O is any arbitrary point fixed in reference frame N, and the N to the left of the d/dt operator indicates that the derivative is taken in reference frame N. The result is independent of the selection of O so long as O is fixed in N.  Mathematical definition of acceleration  The acceleration of point P in reference frame N is defined as the time derivative in N of its velocity: : {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{a}^\\\\mathrm{P} = \\\\frac{^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} ({}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\mathrm{P}).  Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body  For two points P and Q that are fixed on a rigid body B, where B has an angular velocity \\\\scriptstyle{^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{B}} in the reference frame N, the velocity of Q in N can be expressed as a function of the velocity of P in N: : {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\mathrm{Q} = {}^\\\\mathrm{N}!\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\mathrm{P} + {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\mathrm{PQ}. where \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\mathrm{PQ} is the position vector from P to Q .  Acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body  By differentiating the equation for the Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body in N with respect to time, the acceleration in reference frame N of a point Q fixed on a rigid body B can be expressed as : {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{a}^\\\\mathrm{Q} = {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{a}^\\\\mathrm{P} + {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\times \\\\left( {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\mathrm{PQ} \\\\right) + {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}^\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\mathrm{PQ} where \\\\scriptstyle{{}^\\\\mathrm{N}!\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}^\\\\mathrm{B}} is the angular acceleration of B in the reference frame N.  Angular velocity and acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body  As mentioned above, all points on a rigid body B have the same angular velocity {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{B} in a fixed reference frame N, and thus the same angular acceleration {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}^\\\\mathrm{B}.  Velocity of one point moving on a rigid body  If the point R is moving in rigid body B while B moves in reference frame N, then the velocity of R in N is : {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\mathrm{R} = {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\mathrm{Q} + {}^\\\\mathrm{B}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\mathrm{R} where Q is the point fixed in B that is instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest. This relation is often combined with the relation for the Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body.  Acceleration of one point moving on a rigid body  The acceleration in reference frame N of the point R moving in body B while B is moving in frame N is given by : {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{a}^\\\\mathrm{R} = {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\mathbf{a}^\\\\mathrm{Q} + {}^\\\\mathrm{B}\\\\mathbf{a}^\\\\mathrm{R} + 2 {}^\\\\mathrm{N}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\times {}^\\\\mathrm{B}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\mathrm{R} where Q is the point fixed in B that instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest. This equation is often combined with Acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body.  Other quantities  If C is the origin of a local coordinate system L, attached to the body, *the spatial or twist acceleration of a rigid body is defined as the spatial acceleration of C (as opposed to material acceleration above); : \\\\boldsymbol\\\\psi(t,\\\\mathbf{r}_0) = \\\\mathbf{a}(t,\\\\mathbf{r}_0) - \\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega(t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v}(t,\\\\mathbf{r}_0) = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\psi_c(t) + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha(t) \\\\times A(t) \\\\mathbf{r}_0 where * \\\\mathbf{r}_0 represents the position of the point/particle with respect to the reference point of the body in terms of the local coordinate system L (the rigidity of the body means that this does not depend on time) * A(t)\\\\, is the orientation matrix, an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1, representing the orientation (angular position) of the local coordinate system L, with respect to the arbitrary reference orientation of another coordinate system G. Think of this matrix as three orthogonal unit vectors, one in each column, which define the orientation of the axes of L with respect to G. *\\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega(t) represents the angular velocity of the rigid body *\\\\mathbf{v}(t,\\\\mathbf{r}_0) represents the total velocity of the point/particle *\\\\mathbf{a}(t,\\\\mathbf{r}_0) represents the total acceleration of the point/particle *\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha(t) represents the angular acceleration of the rigid body *\\\\boldsymbol\\\\psi(t,\\\\mathbf{r}_0) represents the spatial acceleration of the point/particle *\\\\boldsymbol\\\\psi_c(t) represents the spatial acceleration of the rigid body (i.e. the spatial acceleration of the origin of L). In 2D, the angular velocity is a scalar, and matrix A(t) simply represents a rotation in the xy-plane by an angle which is the integral of the angular velocity over time. Vehicles, walking people, etc., usually rotate according to changes in the direction of the velocity: they move forward with respect to their own orientation. Then, if the body follows a closed orbit in a plane, the angular velocity integrated over a time interval in which the orbit is completed once, is an integer times 360¬∞. This integer is the winding number with respect to the origin of the velocity. Compare the amount of rotation associated with the vertices of a polygon. Kinetics Any point that is rigidly connected to the body can be used as reference point (origin of coordinate system L) to describe the linear motion of the body (the linear position, velocity and acceleration vectors depend on the choice). However, depending on the application, a convenient choice may be: *the center of mass of the whole system, which generally has the simplest motion for a body moving freely in space; *a point such that the translational motion is zero or simplified, e.g. on an axle or hinge, at the center of a ball and socket joint, etc. When the center of mass is used as reference point: *The (linear) momentum is independent of the rotational motion. At any time it is equal to the total mass of the rigid body times the translational velocity. *The angular momentum with respect to the center of mass is the same as without translation: at any time it is equal to the inertia tensor times the angular velocity. When the angular velocity is expressed with respect to a coordinate system coinciding with the principal axes of the body, each component of the angular momentum is a product of a moment of inertia (a principal value of the inertia tensor) times the corresponding component of the angular velocity; the torque is the inertia tensor times the angular acceleration. *Possible motions in the absence of external forces are translation with constant velocity, steady rotation about a fixed principal axis, and also torque-free precession. *The net external force on the rigid body is always equal to the total mass times the translational acceleration (i.e., Newton's second law holds for the translational motion, even when the net external torque is nonzero, and/or the body rotates). *The total kinetic energy is simply the sum of translational and rotational energy. Geometry Two rigid bodies are said to be different (not copies) if there is no proper rotation from one to the other. A rigid body is called chiral if its mirror image is different in that sense, i.e., if it has either no symmetry or its symmetry group contains only proper rotations. In the opposite case an object is called achiral: the mirror image is a copy, not a different object. Such an object may have a symmetry plane, but not necessarily: there may also be a plane of reflection with respect to which the image of the object is a rotated version. The latter applies for S2n, of which the case n = 1 is inversion symmetry. For a (rigid) rectangular transparent sheet, inversion symmetry corresponds to having on one side an image without rotational symmetry and on the other side an image such that what shines through is the image at the top side, upside down. We can distinguish two cases: *the sheet surface with the image is not symmetric - in this case the two sides are different, but the mirror image of the object is the same, after a rotation by 180¬∞ about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane. *the sheet surface with the image has a symmetry axis - in this case the two sides are the same, and the mirror image of the object is also the same, again after a rotation by 180¬∞ about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane. A sheet with a through and through image is achiral. We can distinguish again two cases: *the sheet surface with the image has no symmetry axis - the two sides are different *the sheet surface with the image has a symmetry axis - the two sides are the same Configuration space The configuration space of a rigid body with one point fixed (i.e., a body with zero translational motion) is given by the underlying manifold of the rotation group SO(3). The configuration space of a nonfixed (with non-zero translational motion) rigid body is E+(3), the subgroup of direct isometries of the Euclidean group in three dimensions (combinations of translations and rotations).

In general, a graph may have several spanning trees, but a graph that is not connected will not contain a spanning tree (but see spanning forests below). If all of the edges of G are also edges of a spanning tree T of G, then G is a tree and is identical to T (that is, a tree has a unique spanning tree and it is itself). Applications Several pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* search algorithm, internally build a spanning tree as an intermediate step in solving the problem. In order to minimize the cost of power networks, wiring connections, piping, automatic speech recognition, etc., people often use algorithms that gradually build a spanning tree (or many such trees) as intermediate steps in the process of finding the minimum spanning tree.

A special kind of spanning tree, the Xuong tree, is used in topological graph theory to find graph embeddings with maximum genus. A Xuong tree is a spanning tree such that, in the remaining graph, the number of connected components with an odd number of edges is as small as possible. A Xuong tree and an associated maximum-genus embedding can be found in polynomial time. Definitions A tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. It is a spanning tree of a graph G if it spans G (that is, it includes every vertex of G) and is a subgraph of G (every edge in the tree belongs to G). A spanning tree of a connected graph G can also be defined as a maximal set of edges of G that contains no cycle, or as a minimal set of edges that connect all vertices. Fundamental cycles Adding just one edge to a spanning tree will create a cycle; such a cycle is called a fundamental cycle. There is a distinct fundamental cycle for each edge not in the spanning tree; thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between fundamental cycles and edges not in the spanning tree. For a connected graph with V vertices, any spanning tree will have V ‚àí 1 edges, and thus, a graph of E edges and one of its spanning trees will have E ‚àí V + 1 fundamental cycles. For any given spanning tree the set of all E ‚àí V + 1 fundamental cycles forms a cycle basis, a basis for the cycle space., pp. 65‚Äì67. Fundamental cutsets Dual to the notion of a fundamental cycle is the notion of a fundamental cutset. By deleting just one edge of the spanning tree, the vertices are partitioned into two disjoint sets. The fundamental cutset is defined as the set of edges that must be removed from the graph G to accomplish the same partition. Thus, each spanning tree defines a set of V ‚àí 1 fundamental cutsets, one for each edge of the spanning tree., pp. 67‚Äì69. The duality between fundamental cutsets and fundamental cycles is established by noting that cycle edges not in the spanning tree can only appear in the cutsets of the other edges in the cycle; and vice versa: edges in a cutset can only appear in those cycles containing the edge corresponding to the cutset. This duality can also be expressed using the theory of matroids, according to which a spanning tree is a base of the graphic matroid, a fundamental cycle is the unique circuit within the set formed by adding one element to the base, and fundamental cutsets are defined in the same way from the dual matroid.. Spanning forests In graphs that are not connected, there can be no spanning tree, and one must consider spanning forests instead. Here there are two competing definitions: * Some authors consider a spanning forest to be a maximal acyclic subgraph of the given graph, or equivalently a graph consisting of a spanning tree in each connected component of the graph.; . * For other authors, a spanning forest is a forest that spans all of the vertices, meaning only that each vertex of the graph is a vertex in the forest. For this definition, even a connected graph may have a disconnected spanning forest, such as the forest in which each vertex forms a single-vertex tree.. To avoid confusion between these two definitions, suggest the term \\"full spanning forest\\" for a spanning forest with the same connectivity as the given graph, while instead call this kind of forest a \\"maximal spanning forest\\".; . Counting spanning trees Cayley's formula counts the number of spanning trees on a complete graph. There are 2^{2-2}=1 trees in K_2, 3^{3-2}=3 trees in K_3, and 4^{4-2}=16 trees in K_4. The number t(G) of spanning trees of a connected graph is a well-studied invariant. In specific graphs In some cases, it is easy to calculate t(G) directly: * If G is itself a tree, then . * When G is the cycle graph Cn with n vertices, then . * For a complete graph with n vertices, Cayley's formula. gives the number of spanning trees as . * If G is the complete bipartite graph K_{p,q},. then t(G)=p^{q-1}q^{p-1}. * For the n-dimensional hypercube graph Q_n,. the number of spanning trees is t(G)=2^{2^n-n-1}\\\\prod_{k=2}^n k^. In arbitrary graphs More generally, for any graph G, the number t(G) can be calculated in polynomial time as the determinant of a matrix derived from the graph, using Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem.. Specifically, to compute t(G), one constructs a square matrix in which the rows and columns are both indexed by the vertices of G. The entry in row i and column j is one of three values: * The degree of vertex i, if i = j, * ‚àí1, if vertices i and j are adjacent, or * 0, if vertices i and j are different from each other but not adjacent. The resulting matrix is singular, so its determinant is zero. However, deleting the row and column for an arbitrarily chosen vertex leads to a smaller matrix whose determinant is exactly t(G). Deletion-contraction If G is a graph or multigraph and e is an arbitrary edge of G, then the number t(G) of spanning trees of G satisfies the deletion-contraction recurrence t(G) = t(G ‚àí e) + t(G/e), where G ‚àí e is the multigraph obtained by deleting e and G/e is the contraction of G by e., p. 109. The term t(G ‚àí e) in this formula counts the spanning trees of G that do not use edge e, and the term t(G/e) counts the spanning trees of G that use e. In this formula, if the given graph G is a multigraph, or if a contraction causes two vertices to be connected to each other by multiple edges, then the redundant edges should not be removed, as that would lead to the wrong total. For instance a bond graph connecting two vertices by k edges has k different spanning trees, each consisting of a single one of these edges. Tutte polynomial The Tutte polynomial of a graph can be defined as a sum, over the spanning trees of the graph, of terms computed from the \\"internal activity\\" and \\"external activity\\" of the tree. Its value at the arguments (1,1) is the number of spanning trees or, in a disconnected graph, the number of maximal spanning forests., p. 351. The Tutte polynomial can also be computed using a deletion-contraction recurrence, but its computational complexity is high: for many values of its arguments, computing it exactly is #P-complete, and it is also hard to approximate with a guaranteed approximation ratio. The point (1,1), at which it can be evaluated using Kirchhoff's theorem, is one of the few exceptions.; . Algorithms=Construction A single spanning tree of a graph can be found in linear time by either depth-first search or breadth-first search. Both of these algorithms explore the given graph, starting from an arbitrary vertex v, by looping through the neighbors of the vertices they discover and adding each unexplored neighbor to a data structure to be explored later. They differ in whether this data structure is a stack (in the case of depth-first search) or a queue (in the case of breadth-first search). In either case, one can form a spanning tree by connecting each vertex, other than the root vertex v, to the vertex from which it was discovered. This tree is known as a depth-first search tree or a breadth-first search tree according to the graph exploration algorithm used to construct it.. Depth-first search trees are a special case of a class of spanning trees called Tr√©maux trees, named after the 19th- century discoverer of depth-first search.. Spanning trees are important in parallel and distributed computing, as a way of maintaining communications between a set of processors; see for instance the Spanning Tree Protocol used by OSI link layer devices or the Shout (protocol) for distributed computing. However, the depth-first and breadth-first methods for constructing spanning trees on sequential computers are not well suited for parallel and distributed computers.. Instead, researchers have devised several more specialized algorithms for finding spanning trees in these models of computation.; ; . Optimization In certain fields of graph theory it is often useful to find a minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph. Other optimization problems on spanning trees have also been studied, including the maximum spanning tree, the minimum tree that spans at least k vertices, the spanning tree with the fewest edges per vertex, the spanning tree with the largest number of leaves, the spanning tree with the fewest leaves (closely related to the Hamiltonian path problem), the minimum diameter spanning tree, and the minimum dilation spanning tree... Optimal spanning tree problems have also been studied for finite sets of points in a geometric space such as the Euclidean plane. For such an input, a spanning tree is again a tree that has as its vertices the given points. The quality of the tree is measured in the same way as in a graph, using the Euclidean distance between pairs of points as the weight for each edge. Thus, for instance, a Euclidean minimum spanning tree is the same as a graph minimum spanning tree in a complete graph with Euclidean edge weights. However, it is not necessary to construct this graph in order to solve the optimization problem; the Euclidean minimum spanning tree problem, for instance, can be solved more efficiently in O(n log n) time by constructing the Delaunay triangulation and then applying a linear time planar graph minimum spanning tree algorithm to the resulting triangulation. Randomization A spanning tree chosen randomly from among all the spanning trees with equal probability is called a uniform spanning tree. Wilson's algorithm can be used to generate uniform spanning trees in polynomial time by a process of taking a random walk on the given graph and erasing the cycles created by this walk.. An alternative model for generating spanning trees randomly but not uniformly is the random minimal spanning tree. In this model, the edges of the graph are assigned random weights and then the minimum spanning tree of the weighted graph is constructed.. Enumeration Because a graph may have exponentially many spanning trees, it is not possible to list them all in polynomial time. However, algorithms are known for listing all spanning trees in polynomial time per tree. In infinite graphs Every finite connected graph has a spanning tree. However, for infinite connected graphs, the existence of spanning trees is equivalent to the axiom of choice. An infinite graph is connected if each pair of its vertices forms the pair of endpoints of a finite path. As with finite graphs, a tree is a connected graph with no finite cycles, and a spanning tree can be defined either as a maximal acyclic set of edges or as a tree that contains every vertex. The trees within a graph may be partially ordered by their subgraph relation, and any infinite chain in this partial order has an upper bound (the union of the trees in the chain). Zorn's lemma, one of many equivalent statements to the axiom of choice, requires that a partial order in which all chains are upper bounded have a maximal element; in the partial order on the trees of the graph, this maximal element must be a spanning tree. Therefore, if Zorn's lemma is assumed, every infinite connected graph has a spanning tree.. In the other direction, given a family of sets, it is possible to construct an infinite graph such that every spanning tree of the graph corresponds to a choice function of the family of sets. Therefore, if every infinite connected graph has a spanning tree, then the axiom of choice is true.. See in particular Theorem 2.1, pp. 192‚Äì193. In directed multigraphs The idea of a spanning tree can be generalized to directed multigraphs. Given a vertex v on a directed multigraph G, an oriented spanning tree T rooted at v is an acyclic subgraph of G in which every vertex other than v has outdegree 1. This definition is only satisfied when the \\"branches\\" of T point towards v.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as \\"the principle that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level\\".Oxford English Dictionary. https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/subsidiarity Definition: \\"[mass noun] (in politics) the principle that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level:\\" The concept is applicable in the fields of government, political science, neuropsychology, cybernetics, management and in military command (mission command). The OED adds that the term \\"subsidiarity\\" in English follows the early German usage of \\"Subsidiarit√§t\\". Early German usage: Subsidiarit√§t(1809 or earlier in legal use; 1931 in the context of Catholic social doctrine, in ¬ß80 of Rundschreiben √ºber die gesellschaftliche Ordnung (\\"Encyclical concerning the societal order\\"), the German version of Pope Pius XI's encyclical Quadragesimo anno (1931))\\". More distantly, it is derived from the Latin verb subsidio (to aid or help), and the related noun subsidium (aid or assistance). The concept originates in the writings of Calvinist law-philosopher Johannes Althaus who used the word \\"subsidia\\" in 1603, and was later used in 1891 by the Roman Catholic Church for its social teaching., cited in . Subsidiarity is a general principle of European Union law. In the United States of America, the principle of States' Rights is enshrined in the constitution.  Political theory  Alexis de Tocqueville's classic study, Democracy in America, may be viewed as an examination of the operation of the principle of subsidiarity in early 19th century America. De Tocqueville noted that the French Revolution began with \\"a push towards decentralization ... in the end, an extension of centralization\\".. He wrote that \\"Decentralization has, not only an administrative value, but also a civic dimension, since it increases the opportunities for citizens to take interest in public affairs; it makes them get accustomed to using freedom. And from the accumulation of these local, active, persnickety freedoms, is born the most efficient counterweight against the claims of the central government, even if it were supported by an impersonal, collective will.\\"A History of Decentralization, Earth Institute of Columbia University, accessed 4 February 2013 As Christian Democratic political parties were formed, they adopted the Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity, as well as the neo-Calvinist theological teaching of sphere sovereignty, with both Protestants and Roman Catholics agreeing \\"that the principles of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity boiled down to the same thing\\". The term \\"subsidiarity\\" is also used to refer to a tenet of some forms of conservative or libertarian thought in the United States. For example, conservative author Reid Buckley writes: > Will the American people never learn that, as a principle, to expect swift > response and efficiency from government is fatuous? Will we never heed the > principle of subsidiarity (in which our fathers were bred), namely that no > public agency should do what a private agency can do better, and that no > higher-level public agency should attempt to do what a lower-level agency > can do better ‚Äì that to the degree the principle of subsidiarity is > violated, first local government, the state government, and then federal > government wax in inefficiency?

The United Nations Development Programme's 1999 report on decentralisation noted that subsidiarity was an important principle. It quoted one definition: > Decentralization, or decentralising governance, refers to the restructuring > or reorganisation of authority so that there is a system of co- > responsibility between institutions of governance at the central, regional > and local levels according to the principle of subsidiarity, thus increasing > the overall quality and effectiveness of the system of governance, while > increasing the authority and capacities of sub-national > levels.Decentralization: A Sampling of Definitions, Joint UNDP (United > Nations Development Programme)-Government of Germany evaluation of the UNDP > role in decentralization and local governance, at the United Nations > Development Programme website, October 1999, pp. 2, 16, 26. According to Richard Macrory, the positive effects of a political/economic system governed by the principle of subsidiarity include:Macrory, Richard, 2008, Regulation, Enforcement and Governance in Environmental Law, Cameron May, London, p. 657. * Systemic failures of the type seen in the crash of 2007/08 can largely be avoided, since diverse solutions to common problems avoid common mode failure. * Individual and group initiative is given maximum scope to solve problems. * The systemic problem of moral hazard is largely avoided. In particular, the vexing problem of atrophied local initiative/responsibility is avoided. He writes that the negative effects of a political/economic system governed by the principle of subsidiarity include: * When a genuine principle of liberty is recognised by a higher political entity but not all subsidiary entities, implementation of that principle can be delayed at the more local level. * When a genuinely efficacious economic principle is recognised by a higher political entity, but not all subsidiary entities, implementation of that principle can be delayed at the more local level. * In areas where the local use of common resources has a broad regional, or even global, impact, higher levels of authority may have a natural mandate to supersede local authority.  General principle of European Union law  Subsidiarity is perhaps presently best known as a general principle of European Union law. According to this principle, the Union may only act (i.e. make laws) collectively where independent action of individual countries is insufficient without equal action by other members. The principle was established in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht. However, at the local level it was already a key element of the European Charter of Local Self-Government, an instrument of the Council of Europe promulgated in 1985 (see Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the Charter) (which states that the exercise of public responsibilities should be decentralised). Subsidiarity is related in essence to, but should not be confused with, the concept of a margin of appreciation. Subsidiarity was established in EU law by the Treaty of Maastricht, which was signed on 7 February 1992 and entered into force on 1 November 1993. The present formulation is contained in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (consolidated version following the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009): > Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall within its > exclusive competence, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the > objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the > Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but > can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be > better achieved at Union level. The national parliaments of EU member states have an \\"early warning mechanism\\" whereby if one third raise an objection ‚Äì a \\"yellow card\\" ‚Äì on the basis that the principle of subsidiarity has been violated, then the proposal must be reviewed. If a majority do so ‚Äì an \\"orange card\\" ‚Äì then the Council or Parliament can vote it down immediately. If the logistical problems of putting this into practice are overcome, then the power of the national parliaments could be deemed an extra legislature, without a common debate or physical location: dubbed by EUObserver a \\"virtual third chamber\\".Cooper, Ian (16 October 2009) Comment: Will national parliaments use their new powers?, EUObserver A more descriptive analysis of the principle can be found in Protocol 2 to the European Treaties.Protocol 2 to the European Treaties. Court of Justice The Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is the authority that has to decide whether a regulation falls within the exclusive competence of the Union, as defined by the Treaty of European Union and its predecessors. As the concept of subsidiarity has a political as well as a legal dimension, the Court of Justice has a reserved attitude toward judging whether EU legislation is consistent with the concept. The Court will examine only marginally whether the principle is fulfilled. A detailed explanation of the legislation is not required; it is enough that the EU institutions explain why national legislation seems inadequate and that Union law has an added value. An example is the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in a legal action taken by the Federal Republic of Germany against the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union concerning a Directive on deposit guarantee schemes (13 May 1997). Germany argued that the Directive did not explain how it was compatible with the principle of subsidiarity.

It specifies the physical layer and media access control for LR-WPANs, and is maintained by the IEEE 802.15 working group, which defined the standard in 2003.IEEE 802.15 WPAN‚Ñ¢ Task Group 4, http://www.ieee802.org/15/pub/TG4.html It is the basis for the Zigbee, ISA100.11a, WirelessHART, MiWi, 6LoWPAN, Thread and SNAP specifications, each of which further extends the standard by developing the upper layers which are not defined in IEEE 802.15.4. In particular, 6LoWPAN defines a binding for the IPv6 version of the Internet Protocol (IP) over WPANs, and is itself used by upper layers like Thread. Overview IEEE standard 802.15.4 intends to offer the fundamental lower network layers of a type of wireless personal area network (WPAN) which focuses on low-cost, low-speed ubiquitous communication between devices. It can be contrasted with other approaches, such as Wi-Fi, which offer more bandwidth and require more power. The emphasis is on very low cost communication of nearby devices with little to no underlying infrastructure, intending to exploit this to lower power consumption even more.IEEE 802.15. 4 is a low-data rate wireless personal area network and is the PHY and MAC layer used by many IoT protocols, such as ZigBee, and WirelessHART. The basic framework conceives a 10-meter communications range with a transfer rate of 250 kbit/s. Tradeoffs are possible to favor more radically embedded devices with even lower power requirements, through the definition of not one, but several physical layers. Lower transfer rates of 20 and 40 kbit/s were initially defined, with the 100 kbit/s rate being added in the current revision. Even lower rates can be considered with the resulting effect on power consumption. As already mentioned, the main identifying feature of IEEE 802.15.4 among WPANs is the importance of achieving extremely low manufacturing and operation costs and technological simplicity, without sacrificing flexibility or generality. Important features include real-time suitability by reservation of Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS), collision avoidance through CSMA/CA and integrated support for secure communications. Devices also include power management functions such as link quality and energy detection. The standard does have provisions for supporting time and rate sensitive applications because of its ability to operate in pure CSMA/CA or TDMA access modes. The TDMA mode of operation is supported via the GTS feature of the standard.A. Mishra, C. Na and D. Rosenburgh, \\"On Scheduling Guaranteed Time Slots for Time Sensitive Transactions in IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,\\" MILCOM 2007 - IEEE Military Communications Conference, Orlando, FL, USA, 2007, pp. 1-7. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4455149/ IEEE 802.15.4-conformant devices may use one of three possible frequency bands for operation (868/915/2450 MHz). Protocol architecture IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack Devices are conceived to interact with each other over a conceptually simple wireless network. The definition of the network layers is based on the OSI model; although only the lower layers are defined in the standard, interaction with upper layers is intended, possibly using an IEEE 802.2 logical link control sublayer accessing the MAC through a convergence sublayer. Implementations may rely on external devices or be purely embedded, self-functioning devices.  The physical layer  The physical layer is the initial layer in the OSI reference model used worldwide. The physical layer (PHY) ultimately provides the data transmission service, as well as the interface to the physical layer management entity, which offers access to every layer management function and maintains a database of information on related personal area networks. Thus, the PHY manages the physical RF transceiver and performs channel selection and energy and signal management functions. It operates on one of three possible unlicensed frequency bands: * 868.0‚Äì868.6 MHz: Europe, allows one communication channel (2003, 2006, 2011IEEE Std 802.15.4-2011 8.1.2.2) * 902‚Äì928 MHz: North America, up to ten channels (2003), extended to thirty (2006) * 2400‚Äì2483.5 MHz: worldwide use, up to sixteen channels (2003, 2006) The original 2003 version of the standard specifies two physical layers based on direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) techniques: one working in the 868/915 MHz bands with transfer rates of 20 and 40 kbit/s, and one in the 2450 MHz band with a rate of 250 kbit/s. The 2006 revision improves the maximum data rates of the 868/915 MHz bands, bringing them up to support 100 and 250 kbit/s as well. Moreover, it goes on to define four physical layers depending on the modulation method used. Three of them preserve the DSSS approach: in the 868/915 MHz bands, using either binary or offset quadrature phase shift keying (the second of which is optional); in the 2450 MHz band, using the latter. An alternative, optional 868/915 MHz layer is defined using a combination of binary keying and amplitude shift keying (thus based on parallel, not sequential spread spectrum, PSSS). Dynamic switching between supported 868/915 MHz PHYs is possible. Beyond these three bands, the IEEE 802.15.4c study group considered the newly opened 314‚Äì316 MHz, 430‚Äì434 MHz, and 779‚Äì787 MHz bands in China, while the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 4d defined an amendment to 802.15.4-2006 to support the new 950‚Äì956 MHz band in Japan. First standard amendments by these groups were released in April 2009. In August 2007, IEEE 802.15.4a was released expanding the four PHYs available in the earlier 2006 version to six, including one PHY using Direct Sequence ultra-wideband (UWB) and another using chirp spread spectrum (CSS). The UWB PHY is allocated frequencies in three ranges: below 1 GHz, between 3 and 5 GHz, and between 6 and 10 GHz. The CSS PHY is allocated spectrum in the 2450 MHz ISM band.IEEE Computer Society, (August 31, 2007). IEEE Standard 802.15.4a-2007 In April, 2009 IEEE 802.15.4c and IEEE 802.15.4d were released expanding the available PHYs with several additional PHYs: one for 780 MHz band using O-QPSK or MPSK,IEEE Computer Society, (April 17, 2009). IEEE Standard 802.15.4c-2009 another for 950 MHz using GFSK or BPSK.IEEE Computer Society, (April 17, 2009). IEEE Standard 802.15.4d-2009 IEEE 802.15.4e was chartered to define a MAC amendment to the existing standard 802.15.4-2006 which adopts channel hopping strategy to improve support for the industrial markets, increases robustness against external interference and persistent multi-path fading. On February 6, 2012 the IEEE Standards Association Board approved the IEEE 802.15.4e which concluded all Task Group 4e efforts.  The MAC layer  The medium access control (MAC) enables the transmission of MAC frames through the use of the physical channel. Besides the data service, it offers a management interface and itself manages access to the physical channel and network beaconing. It also controls frame validation, guarantees time slots and handles node associations. Finally, it offers hook points for secure services. Note that the IEEE 802.15 standard does not use 802.1D or 802.1Q, i.e., it does not exchange standard Ethernet frames. The physical frame-format is specified in IEEE802.15.4-2011 in section 5.2. It is tailored to the fact that most IEEE 802.15.4 PHYs only support frames of up to 127 bytes (adaptation layer protocols such as 6LoWPAN provide fragmentation schemes to support larger network layer packets).  Higher layers  No higher-level layers and interoperability sublayers are defined in the standard. Other specifications - such as ZigBee, SNAP, and 6LoWPAN/Thread - build on this standard. RIOT, OpenWSN, TinyOS, Unison RTOS, DSPnano RTOS, nanoQplus, Contiki and Zephyr operating systems also use a few items of IEEE 802.15.4 hardware and software. Network model= Node types  The standard defines two types of network node. The first one is the full-function device (FFD). It can serve as the coordinator of a personal area network just as it may function as a common node. It implements a general model of communication which allows it to talk to any other device: it may also relay messages, in which case it is dubbed a coordinator (PAN coordinator when it is in charge of the whole network). On the other hand, there are reduced-function devices (RFD). These are meant to be extremely simple devices with very modest resource and communication requirements; due to this, they can only communicate with FFDs and can never act as coordinators.  Topologies  IEEE 802.15.4 star and peer-to-peer IEEE 802.15.4 cluster tree Networks can be built as either peer-to-peer or star networks. However, every network needs at least one FFD to work as the coordinator of the network. Networks are thus formed by groups of devices separated by suitable distances. Each device has a unique 64-bit identifier, and if some conditions are met, short 16-bit identifiers can be used within a restricted environment. Namely, within each PAN domain, communications will probably use short identifiers. Peer-to-peer (or point-to-point) networks can form arbitrary patterns of connections, and their extension is only limited by the distance between each pair of nodes. They are meant to serve as the basis for ad hoc networks capable of performing self-management and organization. Since the standard does not define a network layer, routing is not directly supported, but such an additional layer can add support for multihop communications. Further topological restrictions may be added; the standard mentions the cluster tree as a structure which exploits the fact that an RFD may only be associated with one FFD at a time to form a network where RFDs are exclusively leaves of a tree, and most of the nodes are FFDs. The structure can be extended as a generic mesh network whose nodes are cluster tree networks with a local coordinator for each cluster, in addition to the global coordinator. A more structured star pattern is also supported, where the coordinator of the network will necessarily be the central node. Such a network can originate when an FFD decides to create its own PAN and declare itself its coordinator, after choosing a unique PAN identifier. After that, other devices can join the network, which is fully independent from all other star networks. Data transport architecture Frames are the basic unit of data transport, of which there are four fundamental types (data, acknowledgment, beacon and MAC command frames), which provide a reasonable tradeoff between simplicity and robustness. Additionally, a superframe structure, defined by the coordinator, may be used, in which case two beacons act as its limits and provide synchronization to other devices as well as configuration information. A superframe consists of sixteen equal-length slots, which can be further divided into an active part and an inactive part, during which the coordinator may enter power saving mode, not needing to control its network. Within superframes contention occurs between their limits, and is resolved by CSMA/CA. Every transmission must end before the arrival of the second beacon. As mentioned before, applications with well- defined bandwidth needs can use up to seven domains of one or more contentionless guaranteed time slots, trailing at the end of the superframe. The first part of the superframe must be sufficient to give service to the network structure and its devices. Superframes are typically utilized within the context of low-latency devices, whose associations must be kept even if inactive for long periods of time. Data transfers to the coordinator require a beacon synchronization phase, if applicable, followed by CSMA/CA transmission (by means of slots if superframes are in use); acknowledgment is optional. Data transfers from the coordinator usually follow device requests: if beacons are in use, these are used to signal requests; the coordinator acknowledges the request and then sends the data in packets which are acknowledged by the device. The same is done when superframes are not in use, only in this case there are no beacons to keep track of pending messages. Point-to-point networks may either use unslotted CSMA/CA or synchronization mechanisms; in this case, communication between any two devices is possible, whereas in \\"structured\\" modes one of the devices must be the network coordinator. In general, all implemented procedures follow a typical request- confirm/indication-response classification. Reliability and security The physical medium is accessed through a CSMA/CA protocol. Networks which are not using beaconing mechanisms utilize an unslotted variation which is based on the listening of the medium, leveraged by a random exponential backoff algorithm; acknowledgments do not adhere to this discipline. Common data transmission utilizes unallocated slots when beaconing is in use; again, confirmations do not follow the same process. Confirmation messages may be optional under certain circumstances, in which case a success assumption is made. Whatever the case, if a device is unable to process a frame at a given time, it simply does not confirm its reception: timeout-based retransmission can be performed a number of times, following after that a decision of whether to abort or keep trying. Because the predicted environment of these devices demands maximization of battery life, the protocols tend to favor the methods which lead to it, implementing periodic checks for pending messages, the frequency of which depends on application needs. Regarding secure communications, the MAC sublayer offers facilities which can be harnessed by upper layers to achieve the desired level of security. Higher-layer processes may specify keys to perform symmetric cryptography to protect the payload and restrict it to a group of devices or just a point-to-point link; these groups of devices can be specified in access control lists. Furthermore, MAC computes freshness checks between successive receptions to ensure that presumably old frames, or data which is no longer considered valid, does not transcend to higher layers. In addition to this secure mode, there is another, insecure MAC mode, which allows access control lists merely as a means to decide on the acceptance of frames according to their (presumed) source.

The game was a commercial success, with sales in excess of 500,000 units by 2004, and was acclaimed by critics. An iOS version was released on October 28, 2014. Gameplay The Longest Journey is a point-and-click adventure game where the player interacts with objects on the screen to solve puzzles and advance the story. The game features expansive recorded dialogue, most of which is non- essential to completing the game but contributes to the setting. Plot  The game takes place in the parallel universes of magic-dominated Arcadia and industrial Stark. The protagonist, April Ryan, is an 18-year-old art student living in Stark, identified as a 'Shifter' capable of movement between these worlds, and tasked with restoring their essential Balance. The player character, April Ryan, is standing in front of The Tree in her dream. The story begins in Stark, where a sleeping April unintentionally shifts to Arcadia and meets the 'White Dragon', who identifies her as the heroine of the coming story. Upon learning this, April is attacked by a dark 'Chaos Vortex' and awakens in Stark, where she dismisses her experience as a nightmare. The character 'Cortez' later surprises her by revealing his knowledge. When surreal activity begins affecting her friends, April meets again with Cortez, who transports her to the Arcadian city Marcuria. There she meets Tobias Grensret, Vestrum of the Sentinel; learns Alltongue, the common language in Arcadia; and hears from Tobias that the Balance protecting both worlds is dissolving after the dereliction of its Guardian, and must be restored by the appearance of another. To return to Stark, April visits Brian Westhouse, a friend of Cortez, who assists her return; Cortez then tells her of the organization known as the Vanguard or Church of Voltec. The next day, April consults Warren Hughes, a homeless boy who agrees to help April if she erases his criminal record and locates his missing sister, in doing which April finds a data cube on the Church of Voltec. Hughes then refers her to a hacker named Burns Flipper, who reveals that the wealthy magnate Jacob McAllen is head of the Vanguard, assisted by Gordon Halloway, a former candidate for Guardianship divided by the Vanguard into Chaos (in Arcadia) and Logic (in Stark), and gives her a false identification by which to infiltrate the Vanguard through its front company MTI. Meeting Cortez and Father Raul in a Catholic cathedral, April is told that Arcadia is on the brink of war. Later in Arcadia, April meets the innkeeper, Benrime Salmin, and the clairvoyant Abnaxus, ambassador of the Venar, who identifies the coming danger. In the morning, April learns of four magical species, each of whom has prophecies of a savior who will restore the Balance, only to finally break it ‚Äì and determines to visit one such species, the winged Alatian of the island Alais, having gained sea-travel by rescuing a talking bird that she names Crow. Before departing, she learns that she must defeat an alchemist named Roper Klacks, in order to free the ships' wind that he holds captive. At Roper Klacks' Tower, April challenges Klacks to use his magic against her calculator, and wins. Immediately before her departure to Alais, Tobias gives April the Talisman representing the Balance. En route, April kills the monster known as 'Gribbler' while rescuing one of her captive Banda, whose species later give her the name 'April Bandu- embata' as a mark of gratitude and grant her part of the disc necessary to restore the Balance. On the voyage to Alais, a 'Chaos Storm' attacks the ship, and April sabotages the ship's compass to restore its course. When the ship's captain seizes her Talisman, April attempts to retrieve it, and in so doing sinks the ship, whereupon the crew abandon her on a raft. She is taken prisoner by the Maerum, a Mermaid-like species related to the Alatian, but currently their enemies. In revealing their common ancestry, April fulfills a prophecy of the 'Waterstiller', a foretold savior of the Maerum. After fulfilling the second prophecy by killing a 'Snapjaw', she is conveyed to fulfill the third by re-uniting the Maerum with the Alatians. After a series of tasks and in meeting with the Alatians' leader, April fulfills their prophecy by flying without wings, and convinces the Alatian to make peace with the Maerum. In a coastal sea cave, the Teller's guard and the Maerum Queen bring stones which combine to form the second part of the Balance's disc; whereupon the Maerum convey April, at her own request, to the Blue Dragon, who gives April one of the disc's Jewels and takes her to a ship inhabited by the Dark People, who give April the third piece of the disc, and an astral map locating the Guardian's Realm. At the Marcurian Harbor, April is attacked by the Chaos and returns to the Cathedral in Stark. There, Father Raul reveals that he is also a Sentinel Minstrum of Stark, and that Cortez is missing. On returning to her lodgings, April is caught by Gordon Halloway. She is rescued by another character, Lady Alvane, who teaches April to shift at will, and sends April to Abnaxus to receive the disc's final piece. April then returns to the White Dragon, who reveals herself as April's mother and dies, and a new White Dragon emerges from her egg. Returned to Stark, April gives Flipper the star map to decipher, infiltrates MTI, and is captured by antagonist McAllen. Unable to escape, she surrenders her two jewels and the disc, and is then imprisoned. Upon escaping in pursuit of her object, she is trapped again; but rescued by Cortez. McAllen then reveals that he and Cortez are two Dragons (called 'Draic Kin', in-universe) meant to protect Stark, but at odds after McAllen's decision to re-unite the two worlds despite the risk of Chaos. The two then appear to die in combat. Retrieving the disc and the four jewels, April returns to Flipper, whom she finds dying after the seizure of her deciphered map by Gordon Halloway, and gains a copy from him, which she uses to locate the Guardian's Realm near the space station 'Morning Star'. At the station, April frees Adrian, the derelict Guardian, and escapes with Halloway in pursuit. On her way to the Guardians' Tower, she imprisons the Chaos Vortex in her Talisman and later summons Crow, who helps her complete the necessary trials. Inside the tower, April re-unites Halloway with the Chaos Vortex to restore his candidacy as Guardian and returns to Stark and Arcadia. In the Epilogue, the scene returns to Lady Alvane's home, where she has narrated the entire story to two youths, and where she reveals that the two worlds re- united under Gordon Halloway. Upon their departure, an aged and graying Crow enters, asking the tale of the \\"warrior princess\\" who won the war of the Balance, and she corrects his impression; a possible reference to the sequel, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. Development The title of the game is a reference to the quote by the Swedish diplomat Dag Hammarskj√∂ld: \\"The longest journey is the journey inward, for he who has chosen his destiny has started upon his quest for the source of his being.\\" Other inspirations for the game included Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, Neil Gaiman's The Sandman and The Books of Magic, Hellblazer, Swamp Thing, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Joss Whedon's writing in general. The Longest Journey was developed by a small internal team at Funcom led by Ragnar T√∏rnquist. It was their first original project. Funcom put few restrictions on the developers except the budget (approx. $2‚Äì3 million) and the deadline. Since the team had to develop the game engine and most of the required tools from scratch, they struggled to release the game on time. For most of 1999, the team had to work overtime and during weekends to ultimately meet the deadline. In the original Norwegian release, April Ryan was voiced by the journalist Synn√∏ve Svab√∏. First published by IQ Media Nordic in Norway in 1999, it was later localized for and released in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Czech Republic, Russia, and the United States. The game was originally written and recorded in English, though most of the localizations were released before the English version. In October 2011, it was announced that The Longest Journey was being ported to iOS, with the article mainly focusing on the iPhone. Release and sales Before its release, The Longest Journey received positive preview coverage and was heavily promoted in Norway. Dagbladet described the title as \\"the first big Norwegian computer game.\\" Its target demographics were outside the industry's norm: Ragnar T√∏rnquist reported that Funcom wanted to capture \\"a more adult audience in addition to the usual teenage buyers\\". The game's high budget meant that 150,000 sales were necessary to break even. However, Norway's market for games was small. According to Herman Berg of Digi.no, it was rare for a game's Norwegian sales to reach 10,000 units. The Longest Journeys domestic sales goal was 15,000 units, while its global lifetime goal was 300,000 units. Funcom shipped 15,000 copies of The Longest Journey to Norwegian retailers in the game's first month and a half on shelves, and publisher IQ Media noted that sell-through and store re-orders were high through late December. Sell-in had reached 10,000 units in Sweden by that time. Based on the available data, IQ's Nickolay Nickelsen noted that it \\"looks as if half of the players are actually girls.\\" According to T√∏rnquist, The Longest Journey experienced \\"solid sales across Europe\\" before its release in the United States. The game sold 15,000 units in Norway by May 2000, while overall European sales totaled 100,000 units by September 2000. It launched in Germany with a shipment of 40,000 units to retailers; Chris Kellner of DTP Entertainment, which handled the game's German localization, reported its lifetime sales between 10,000 and 50,000 copies in that market. In Spain, the game sold 50,000 copies after roughly one year, a commercial hit for the country. Its English release was purposely delayed to prevent imports from cannibalizing local sales across Europe. The Longest Journey struggled to find a North American publisher. According to market research firm PC Data, North American sales of The Longest Journey reached 12,495 retail units by the end of 2000, of which 10,873 were sold in December. By January 2001, global sales of The Longest Journey totaled almost 200,000 units. PC Data reported an additional 40,160 retail sales of The Longest Journey in North America during the first six months of 2001. By that June, the game's worldwide sales had climbed to 250,000 copies, of which the United States accounted for 90,000. PC Data's estimate for the title's North American sales for January‚ÄìDecember 2001 was 71,962 retail units, followed by another 12,044 in the first six months of 2002. By July 2002, global sales of the game had reached 450,000 copies, according to Funcom. A new shipment was released in North America that month, as its earlier printing had sold out. Ragnar T√∏rnquist noted in 2003 that he was \\"very satisfied\\" with The Longest Journeys sales in North America, and explained, \\"There was such strong word of mouth, and so many great reviews, that we managed to get TLJ into most big stores and out to the players regardless of marketing.\\" In May 2003, Marek Bronstring of Adventure Gamers wrote that The Longest Journey \\"sold half a million copies worldwide and it's still selling, making it one of the most successful adventure games in recent years.\\" The following year, IGN reported that its sales had surpassed 500,000 units. The site's Richard Aihoshi summarized The Longest Journey as a \\"a critical and commercial success\\". In 2019, T√∏rnquist recalled that \\"at least 50 per cent\\" of The Longest Journeys players were female, a fact that he believed increased its commercial success. Reception The Longest Journey was acclaimed by critics. It was praised for its female protagonist April Ryan, who is considered one of the most memorable female characters in the history of adventure games, and also for its enigmatic, complex storyline and high production values, but was criticized for some of its more obscure puzzles. It received a score of 88.00% on GameRankings and 91/100 on Metacritic. GameSpot called it \\"one of the best adventure games in years\\" and applauded the \\"complex and interesting story\\" although found the ending lacking as \\"the epilogue does little to wrap everything up\\". IGN said the game \\"actually reinvents how stories can be told in the medium\\" and noticed the mature content, including \\"harsh subject matter, and some big time swearing\\". Some of the puzzles were described as \\"inane\\", but on the whole the game \\"hones the genre into its tightest, sharpest form yet\\". The US edition of PC Gamer praised the \\"mature and magical\\" story, the \\"sumptuous\\" graphics, and the game's puzzles. The only criticism levied by the magazine was that some parts of the game might be \\"too edgy\\" for younger players. Eric Bratcher reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is a potential epic that seems to have taken tranquilizers. It's still worthwhile, but it's also a little slow, a little dull, and sometimes just doesn't make sense.\\" The Longest Journey was named the best computer adventure game of 2000 by Computer Gaming World, The Electric Playground, GameSpot, IGN and PC Gamer US, and was nominated in the category by CNET Gamecenter and Computer Games Magazine. It also won IGN's \\"Best Game No One Played\\" and GameSpot's \\"Best Story\\" awards. Computer Gaming Worlds editors praised the game for offering \\"a mature, literate, and compelling story featuring a strong female heroine who, for once, is not exploited for her looks.\\" In 2011, Adventure Gamers named The Longest Journey the second-best adventure game ever released. Sequels A sequel to The Longest Journey began production in early 2003. The game, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, was released in April 2006. The next installment of the series, Dreamfall Chapters, was crowd-funded on Kickstarter and was released episodically. Its first episode was released in October 2014. The last episode shipped in June 2016. The developers view Dreamfall: The Longest Journey as more of a spin-off than a direct sequel to the first game, as it revolves around a new protagonist, with a new storyline. The direct sequel to The Longest Journey, entitled The Longest Journey Home, was revealed in 2013 and is to be produced after Dreamfall Chapters. By 2016 the release of TLJHome is still under a question. Ragnar Tornquist stated that even though he wants to produce the game, there are many reasons why it may never happen.

It is found throughout mainland Australia and possibly on the islands to the north, including New Guinea and eastern Indonesia. It is resident or nomadic over the warmer part of its range (inland Australia and points north), and a summer breeding migrant to the cooler southern parts of Australia. White-winged trillers are fairly common in woodland, and open scrub through most of their range, and close to riverbeds in the central arid zone. The conspicuous male bird--black above and white below in breeding plumage--trills cheerfully through much of the day during the breeding season (mid-spring to early summer), frequently rising on fluttering wings in song flight. The female is similarly patterned but in dull fawns and white. In the non-breeding season, male birds appear similar to the female, retaining blackish feathers only on the wings and tail. Typically 16 to 18 cm long, white-winged trillers eat a variety of insects, which are taken on the ground, from in foliage, or in the air. The correct classification of the white-winged triller and its close northern relative, the white-shouldered triller (Lalage sueurii) of Eastern Indonesia is uncertain. Some authorities regard them as two races of a single species, in which case the white-winged triller becomes Lalage sueurii tricolor.

He released some forty albums over this period, composing the music and the majority of the lyrics. He released many hit singles, particularly between 1960 and the mid-seventies. Some of his songs have become classics of the French chanson repertoire, including \\"Avec le temps\\", \\"C'est extra\\", \\"Jolie M√¥me\\" and \\"Paris canaille\\".  Early life  Son of Joseph Ferr√©, staff manager at Monte-Carlo Casino, and Marie Scotto, a dressmaker of Italian descent from Piedmont, he had a sister, Lucienne, two years older. L√©o Ferr√© had an early interest in music. At the age of seven, he joined the choir of the Monaco Cathedral and discovered polyphony through singing pieces by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Tom√°s Luis de Victoria. His uncle, former violinist and secretary at the Casino, used to bring him to performances and rehearsals at the Monte Carlo Opera. Ferr√© listened to such musicians as bass singer Feodor Chaliapin, discovered Beethoven under the baton of Arturo Toscanini (Coriolanus), was deeply moved by the Fifth Symphony. But it is the sweet presence of composer Maurice Ravel during L'Enfant et les Sortil√®ges rehearsals that impressed him the most.Interview with Michel Lancelot, La M√©moire courte (Europe 1), 1969. At nine years of age he entered Saint-Charles College of Bordighera, run by the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Italy. He remained there for eight long years of severe discipline and boredom. He wrote about this lonely and caged childhood in an autofiction (Beno√Æt Mis√®re, 1970). He graduated from high school at Monaco, but his father did not let him attend the Conservatory of Music.  Career  In 1945, while still a \\"farmer\\" and a Jack-of-all-trades at Radio Monte-Carlo, Ferr√© met Edith Piaf, who encouraged him to try his luck in Paris. In April 1947, Ferr√© agreed to tour in Martinique, which turned out to be disastrous. From the end of 1947 Ferr√© produced and hosted on Paris Inter station several cycles of programs devoted to classical music. In Musique Byzantine (1953‚Äì54), he expanded his topics on aesthetics, such as tonality necessity, exotic melody, opera (the \\"song of rich people\\"), boredom, and originality or \\"marshmallow music\\".L√©o Ferr√©, \\"La musique souvent me prend... comme l'amour\\", La M√©moire et la mer, 1999, p. 91. In 1952, to submit Verdi examination at La Scala in Milan, he wrote the libretto and music of an opera called La Vie d'artiste (same title as the song). It transposed his past years' experience into a kind of a black comedy but Ferr√© did not seem to like it much, finally abandoning it for other projects.Quentin Dupont, \\"Vous savez qui je suis, maintenant?\\", La M√©moire et la mer, 2003, p. 421. He began to sing in larger venues such as l'Olympia, as the opening act of Josephine Baker in 1954. In 1956, Ferr√© wrote and composed La Nuit (The Night), a ballet with sung sections commissioned by choreographer Roland Petit. It was a violent flop. From 1960 to 1970, Ferr√© worked with arranger Jean-Michel Defaye, whose classical skills and taste accorded well with Ferr√©'s musical sensitivity. They maintained a steady pace of creation, realizing almost an album a year, sometimes more. This artistic output, including the way Ferr√© would write for symphonic orchestras after 1970, would have an influence in the English-speaking world over such singer-songwriters as Scott Walker,Young, Rob (2013). Scott: The Collection 1967‚Äì1970, Universal. Martin NewellNewell's musician Louis Philippe says on his website they went for the L√©o Ferr√© treatment in the string arrangements of a song such as \\"Arcadian Boys\\", from The Off-White Album (1995), since Ferr√© is one of Newell's favourite singers. or Benjamin Clementine.Godwin, Richard (6 December 2013). \\"Benjamin Clementine: the future sound of London\\". London Evening Standard. In March 1968, Ferr√© did not return at home after a gig. In his absence, Ferr√©'s chimpanzee P√©p√©e suffered a fall and refused to be approached. Eventually, Madeleine asked a hunter neighbour to put the chimpanzee out of its misery. Ferr√©'s requiem for the primate would be his eponymous song \\"P√©p√©e\\". The singer blamed his wife for P√©p√©e's death and they would divorce after endless procedures. In 1969, Ferr√© settled in Tuscany, in Italy. The huge success of \\"C'est extra\\", an erotic ballad, greatly expanded his audience, especially among the French youth, who recognized in the poet the \\"prophet\\" of his own rebellion. Backed by this new energy, Ferr√© began to smash traditional song structures to explore spoken word and long monologues. With a very precise work on the voice (rhythm, speech) and rhetorical writing derived from the prose of poet Arthur Rimbaud, Ferr√© ritualized his speaking in an incantatory and dramatic fashion.C√©line Chabot-Canet, L√©o Ferr√© : Une voix et un phras√© embl√©matiques, L'Harmattan, 2008. In 1975 Ferr√© conducted successively Orchestra of the Institut des Hautes √âtudes Musicales in Montreux, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Li√®ge, and the Pasdeloup Orchestra at the Palais des congr√®s de Paris. It was a perilous challenge for Ferr√©, who conducted the orchestra and sang at the same time. He mixed Ravel and Beethoven with his own compositions and reversed the placement of the orchestra. 140 musicians and choir singers were on stage. This was an unprecedented performance, breaking free from conventions and blending separated worlds. Concerts were sold out for five weeks, but critics from the classical music field rejected this hybrid show. From 1976 to 1979 he toured less. He drifted from his violently declamatory expression of revolt to avoid being typecast.\\"I think the revolt is no longer appropriate. Revolt is a way of getting into the City. This is a tribal virtue (...).\\" \\"Technique de l'exil\\" (\\"The Exile Technique\\"), in La Mauvaise graine, √âdition N¬∞ 1, 1993. In 1976, Ferr√© signed with CBS Records International. From then until the end of his career the majority of his recordings would be made with the Milan-based RAI National Symphony Orchestra under his conducting.For contractual reasons, the orchestra would be named Orchestre symphonique de Milan on record sleeves. CBS soon dropped Ferr√©, whose commercial potential was estimated too low (his new aesthetics of symphonic down-tempo being against the current of all musical trends, it was complicated to put the artist on the radio and reduced the possibility of a hit). Being dropped by the \\"professionals\\", and disgusted for good with being \\"a merchandise for producers\\"Interview with La Nouvelle R√©publique du Centre-Ouest newspaper, 5 June 1979., Ferr√© refused to accept French song prizes.Interview with Jean-Louis Foulquier, Pollen (France Inter), 1987. He also refused the proposal to enter the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (at the highest grade) and to support President of France Fran√ßois Mitterrand in his reelection campaign in exchange for leading and conducting of a first- class symphonic orchestra. He refused being guest of honor in the Victoires de la musique (Music's Victories),Robert Belleret, L√©o Ferr√©, une vie d'artiste: ninth part, chapter \\"Je te donne ces vers...\\", Actes Sud, 1996. annual French award ceremony recognizing the best musical artists of the year.

Obv: stylized crescents and wreaths with hidden faces. Rev: Celtic warrior on horse right, carrying carnyx. The Catuvellauni (Gaulish: \\"war-chiefs\\") were a Celtic tribe or state of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, attested by inscriptions into the 4th century. The fortunes of the Catuvellauni and their kings before the conquest can be traced through ancient coins and scattered references in classical histories. They are mentioned by Cassius Dio, who implies that they led the resistance against the conquest in AD 43. They appear as one of the civitates of Roman Britain in Ptolemy's Geography in the 2nd century, occupying the town of Verlamion (modern St Albans) and the surrounding areas of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and southern Cambridgeshire. Their territory was bordered to the north by the Iceni and Corieltauvi, to the east by the Trinovantes, to the west by the Dobunni and Atrebates, and to the south by the Regnenses and Cantiaci.  Name  The name 'Catuvellauni' (Gaulish: Catu-uellauni 'war-chiefs, chiefs-of- war') stems from the Gaulish root catu- ('combat') attached to uellauni ('chiefs, commandants'). It is probably related to the name of the 'Catalauni', a Belgic tribe dwelling in the modern Champagne region during the Roman period. Before the Roman conquest The Catuvellauni are part of the Aylesford-Swarling archaeological group in Southern England often linked to Belgic Gaul and possibly to an actual Belgic conquest of the region alluded to by Caesar. John T. Koch conjectures that the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains and the modern name of Ch√¢lons-en-ChampagneJohn T. Koch (ed.) Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia, Vol. I, p.357 preserves the name of an original continental tribe of Catuvellauni, a name he derives from a compound of the ancient Celtic roots *katu- (\\"battle\\") and *wer-lo (\\"better\\"), thus meaning \\"excelling in battle\\", the same source as that of the later British and Breton personal name Cadwallon. Cassivellaunus, who led the resistance to Julius Caesar's first expedition to Britain in 54 BC, is often taken to have belonged to the Catuvellauni. His tribal background is not mentioned by Caesar, but his territory, north of the Thames and to the west of the Trinovantes, corresponds to that later occupied by the Catuvellauni. The extensive earthworks at Devil's Dyke near Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire are thought to have been the tribe's original capital. Coin of Tasciovanus, king of the Catuvellauni. Tasciovanus was the first king to mint coins at Verlamion, beginning ca 20 BC. He appears to have expanded his power at the expense of the Trinovantes to the east, as some of his coins, ca 15‚Äì10 BC, were minted in their capital Camulodunum (modern Colchester). This advance was given up, possibly under pressure from Rome, and a later series of coins were again minted at Verulamium. The Celtic tribes of Southern Britain showing the Catuvellauni and their neighbours. Coins of Epaticcus, king of the Catuvellauni. However, Camulodunum was retaken, either by Tasciovanus or by his son Cunobelinus, who succeeded him ca AD 9 and ruled for about 30 years. Little is known of Cunobelinus's life, but his name survived into British legend, culminating in William Shakespeare's play Cymbeline. Geoffrey of Monmouth says he was brought up at the court of Augustus and willingly paid tribute to Rome. Archaeology indicates increased trading and diplomatic links with the Roman Empire. Under Cunobelinus and his family, the Catuvellauni appear to have become the dominant power in south-eastern Britain. His brother Epaticcus gained territory to the south and west at the expense of the Atrebates until his death ca AD 35. The grave of the \\"Druid of Colchester\\" dates to this period, providing evidence of medical practices and technology within the Catuvellauni tribe.Games Britannia - 1. Dicing with Destiny, BBC Four, 1:05am Tuesday 8 December 2009 Three sons of Cunobelinus are known to history. Adminius, whose power-base appears from his coins to have been in Kent, was exiled by his father shortly before AD 40 according to Suetonius, prompting the emperor Caligula to mount his abortive invasion of Britain. Two other sons, Togodumnus and Caratacus, are named by Dio Cassius. No coins of Togodumnus are known, but Caratacus's rare coins suggest that he followed his uncle Epaticcus in completing the conquest of the lands of the Atrebates. It was the exile of the Atrebatic king, Verica, that prompted Claudius to launch a successful invasion, led by Aulus Plautius, in AD 43. Dio tells us that, by this stage, Cunobelinus was dead, and Togodumnus and Caratacus led the initial resistance to the invasion in Kent. They were defeated by Plautius in two crucial battles on the rivers Medway (see Battle of the Medway) and Thames. He also tells us that the Bodunni, a tribe or kingdom who were tributary to the Catuvellauni, switched sides. This may be a misspelling of the Dobunni, who lived in Gloucestershire, and may give an indication of how far Catuvellaunian power extended. Togodumnus died shortly after the battle on the Thames. Plautius halted and sent word for the emperor to join him, and Claudius led the final advance to Camulodunum. The territories of the Catuvellauni became the nucleus of the new Roman province. Under Roman rule Caratacus, however, had survived, and continued to lead the resistance to the invaders. We next hear of him in Tacitus's Annals, leading the Silures and Ordovices in what is now Wales against the Roman governor Publius Ostorius Scapula. Ostorius defeated him in a set-piece battle somewhere in Ordovician territory (see Battle of Caer Caradoc) in AD 51, capturing members of his family, but Caratacus again escaped. He fled north to the Brigantes, but their queen, Cartimandua, was loyal to the Romans and handed him over in chains. Caratacus was exhibited as a war-prize as part of a triumphal parade in Rome. He was allowed to make a speech to the Senate, and made such an impression that he and his family were freed and allowed to live in peace in Rome. Verulamium, the Roman settlement near Verlamion, gained the status of municipium ca 50, allowing its leading magistrates to become Roman citizens. It was destroyed in the rebellion of Boudica in 60 or 61, but was soon rebuilt. Its forum and basilica were completed in 79 or 81, and were dedicated in an inscription by the governor, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, to the emperor Titus. Its theatre, the first Roman theatre in Britain, was built ca 140. An inscription records that the civitas of the Catuvellauni were involved in the reconstruction of Hadrian's Wall, probably in the time of Septimius Severus in the early 3rd century. Saint Alban, the first British Christian martyr, was a citizen of Verulamium in the late 3rd or early 4th century, and was killed there. The city took its modern name from him. The tombstone of a woman of the Catuvellauni called Regina, freedwoman and wife of Barates, a soldier from Palmyra in Syria, was found in the 4th-century Roman fort of Arbeia in South Shields in the north-east of England.

He has been called \\"the father of South African botany\\", \\"pioneer of Occidental Medicine in Japan\\" and the \\"Japanese Linnaeus\\".  Early life  Thunberg was born and grew up in J√∂nk√∂ping, Sweden. At the age of 18, he entered the Swedish Uppsala University where he was taught by the famous Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus who was mainly known for his work Philosophia Botanica (1751). Thunberg graduated in 1767 after only 6 years of studying. To deepen his knowledge in botany, medicine and natural history, he was encouraged by Linnaeus in 1770 to travel to Paris and Amsterdam. In Amsterdam and Leiden where he stayed to study the city's collection of plants and musea, Thunberg met the Dutch botanist and physician, Johannes Burman and his son Nicolaas Burman who himself had been a disciple of Linnaeus.Svedelius, N. (1944). Carl Peter Thunberg (1743‚Äì1828) on His Bicentenary. Isis, 35 (2), p. 129 Having heard of Thunberg's inquisitive mind, his skills in botany and medicine and Linnaeus' high esteem of his Swedish pupil, Johannes Burman and Laurens Theodorus Gronovius, a councillor of Leiden, convinced Thunberg to travel to either the West or the East Indies to collect plants and animal specimen for the botanic garden at Leiden which was still lacking exotic exhibits. Thunberg who had ever since been fascinated by the secretive and mainly unknown East Indies was eager to travel to the Cape of Good Hope and apply his knowledge.Thunberg, C. P. (1791). Resa uti Europa, Africa, Asia, f√∂rr√§ttad √•ren 1770‚Äì1779. Tredje Band. Published by J. Edman, Uppsala, Sweden, p. 22 With the help of Burman and Gronovius, Thunberg entered the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, V.O.C.) as a surgeon on board of the Schoonzicht. As the East Indies were under Dutch control, the only way to enter the colonies was via the V.O.C. Hence, Thunberg debarked in December 1771.Skuncke 2013, pp. 39, 99 In March 1772, he reached Cape Town in South Africa.  Thunberg in South Africa  During his three-year stay, the Swede managed to perfect his Dutch and delve deeper into the scientific knowledge, culture and societal structure of the \\"Hottentotten\\", the Dutch name for the Khoikhoi, the native people of Western South Africa. Thunberg's travel to Africa is described in the second volume of his travelogue. The Khoikhoi were the first foreign culture with which the Swede was confronted.Jung 2002, p. 95 The different customs and traditions of the native people elicited both his disgust and admiration. For example, he considered the Khoikhoi's custom to grease their skin with fat and dust as an obnoxious habit about which he wrote in his travelogue: \\"For uncleanliness, the Hottentots have the greatest love. They grease their entire body with greasy substances and above this, they put cow dung, fat or something similar.\\"Thunberg 1986, p. 180 Yet, this harsh judgement is moderated by the reason he saw for this practice and so he continues that: \\"This stops up their pores and their skin is covered with a thick layer which protects it from heat in Summer and from cold during Winter.\\". This attitude ‚Äì to try to justify rituals he did not understand ‚Äì also marks his encounter with the Japanese people. Since the main purpose for his journey was to collect specimen for the gardens in Leiden, Thunberg regularly undertook field trips and journeys into the interior of South Africa. Between September 1772 and January 1773, he accompanied the Dutch superintendent of the V.O.C garden, Johan Andreas Auge. Their journey took them to the north of Saldanha Bay, east along the Breede Valley through the Langkloof as far as the Gamtoos River and returning by way of the Little Karoo.Thunberg, C. P. (1793). Travels at the Cape of Good Hope, 1772‚Äì1775. Emeritus Prof. V. S. Forbes, London, p. 27 During this expedition and also later on, Thunberg kept regular contact with scholars in Europe, especially the Netherlands and Sweden, but also with other members of the V.O.C who sent him animal skins. Shortly after returning, Thunberg met Francis Masson, a Scots gardener who had come to Cape Town to collect plants for the Royal Gardens at Kew. They were immediately drawn together by their shared interests. During one of their trips, they were joined by Robert Jacob Gordon, on leave from his regiment in the Netherlands. Together, the scientists undertook two further inland expeditions. During his three expeditions into the interior, Thunberg collected a significant number of specimens of both flora and fauna. At the initiative of Linnaeus, he graduated at Uppsala as Doctor of Medicine in absentia, while he was at the Cape in 1772. Thunberg left the Cape for Batavia on 2 March 1775. He arrived in Batavia on 18 May 1775, and left for Japan on 20 June.  Stay in Japan  In August 1775, he arrived at the Dutch factory of the V.O.C. (Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie) at Dejima, a small artificial island (120 m by 75 m) in the Bay of Nagasaki connected to the city by a single small bridge. However, just like the Dutch merchants, Thunberg was hardly allowed to leave the island. These severe restrictions to the freedom to move had been imposed by the Japanese shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1639 after the Portuguese who had been the first to arrive in Japan in 1543, had garnered the shogun's rage through their missionary attempts. The only locals who were allowed regular contact with the Dutch were the interpreters of Nagasaki and the relevant authorities of the city.Totman, C. D. (2000). A History of Japan. Blackwell Publishers Ltd, Oxford and Malden, p. 275 Shortly after the Schoonzicht's arrival on Deshima, Thunberg was appointed head surgeon of the trading post. To still be able to collect specimen of Japanese plants and animals as well as to gather information on the population, Thunberg soon began to systematically construct networks with the interpreters by sending them small notes containing medical knowledge and receiving botanical knowledge or rare Japanese coins in return. Quickly, the news spread that a well-educated Dutch physician was in town who seemed to be able to help the local doctors cure the Dutch disease, another word for syphilis. As a result, the appropriate authorities granted him more and more visits to the city and finally even allowed him one-day trips into the vicinity of Nagasaki where Thunberg had the chance to collect specimen by himself.Thunberg, C. P. (1796). Travels in Europe, Africa and Asia, performed between the Years 1770 and 1779. Published by W. Richardson, London, UK, p. 37 During his visits in town, Thunberg began to recruit disciples, mainly the Nagasaki interpreters and local physicians. His major knowledge contribution was in the teachings of new medical treatments such as a mercury cure for the \\"Dutch Disease\\" and of the production of new medicine. During this process, however, he also instructed his pupils in the Dutch language and European manners of conduct, thus furthering the growing interest into the Dutch and European culture on the side of the Japanese, known under the term rangaku.Screech, T. (2012). Japan Extolled and Decried: Carl Peter Thunberg and the Shogun‚Äôs Realm, 1775 ‚Äì 1776. Routledge: Taylor and Francis Group, London and New York, p. 59 The Swedish writer Marie-Christine SkunckeSkuncke 2013, p. 101 even points out that Thunberg who had brought some seeds of European vegetables with him, showed the Japanese some botanical practices, thus contributing significantly to an expansion of the Japanese horticulture. On the other hand, Thunberg also profited from his teachings himself. As a former medical student he was mainly interested in medical knowledge, and the Japanese showed him the practice of acupuncture. The co-operation of Thunberg and the local physicians even led to a knowledge fusion which brought about a new acupuncture point called shakutaku. The discovery of shakutaku was a result of Thunberg's anatomic knowledge and the Japanese' traditional medicine of neuronic moxibustion. Yet, he likewise brought back knowledge on Japan's religion and societal structure, thus boosting an increasing interest into Japan, an early cultural form of Japonism.Skuncke 2013, p. 125Fujita, R. (1944). Researches on Pressation-Points and Papule-Points and Related Subjects. Ninth Report: From the Angle of Oriental Medicine, Part 2. Kanazawa, Japan, p. 59 In both countries, Thunberg's knowledge exchange hence led to a cultural opening-up effect which too manifested itself also in the spread of universities and boarding schools which taught knowledge on the other culture. For this reason, Thunberg has been given the title of being \\"the most important eye witness of Tokugawa Japan in the eighteenth century\\".Ortolani, B. (1995). The Japanese Theatre: From Shamanistic Ritual to Contemporary Pluralism. Princeton UP, p. 281 Due to his scientific reputation, Thunberg was given the opportunity in 1776 to accompany the Dutch ambassador M. Feith to the shogun's court in Edo, today's Tokyo. During that journey, the Swede was given the chance to collect a great number of specimen of plants and animals and likewise to talk to Japanese locals in the villages they traversed on their way. It is in this time that Thunberg wrote two of his scientific masterpieces, the Flora Japonica (1784) and the Fauna Japonica (1833). The latter was completed by the German traveller Philipp Franz von Siebold who visited Japan between 1823 and 1829. Yet, von Siebold based the Fauna Japonica on Thunberg's notes which he carried with him all the time in Japan.Nordenstamm, B. (2013). Carl Peter Thunberg and Japanese Natural History. Asian Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences, 2 (2), pp. 1 ‚Äì 7 Additionally, on his way to Edo, Thunberg managed to obtain a vast number of Japanese coins which he described in detail in the fourth volume of his travelogue, Travels in Europe, Africa and Asia, performed between the Years 1770 and 1779. The coins presented an important informational repository on the culture, religion and history of Japan, as their possession as well as their export by foreigners had been strictly forbidden by the shogun. This prohibition had been imposed to prevent the Empire of China and other rivals of the shogunate from copying the money and flooding the Japanese markets with forged coins.Kornicki, P. (2010). Catalogue of the Japanese Coin Collection (Pre-Meiji) at the British Museum. British Museum Research Publication n¬∞174, pp. 28‚Äì30 Consequently, Thunberg's transport of Japanese coins granted European scholars an entirely new perspective on Japan's monetary economy and allowed them to draw conclusions on Japan's culture and religion through decorations on the coins and the materials used to produce the currency. In November 1776, after Thunberg had returned from his trip to the shogun's court, he left Japan and went on to Java, an island that nowadays belongs to Indonesia. From there on, he travelled to Ceylon in July 1777, today's Sri Lanka. Here again, his major interest lay in collecting plants and other specimen. In 1778, Thunberg left Ceylon to return to Europe. Return to Sweden In February 1778, Thunberg left Ceylon for Amsterdam, passing by at the Cape and staying there for two weeks. He finally arrived at Amsterdam in October 1778. In 1776, Thunberg had been elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He returned to Sweden in 1779. But first he made a short trip to London and made the acquaintance of Sir Joseph Banks. He saw there the Japanese collection from the 1680s of the German naturalist Engelbert Kaempfer (1651‚Äì1716), who had preceded him at Dejima. He also met Forster, who introduced him to his collections he had obtained during Cook's second voyage. On arrival in Sweden in March 1779, he was informed of the death of Linnaeus, one year earlier. He was first appointed botanical demonstrator in 1777, and in 1781 professor of medicine and natural philosophy at the University of Uppsala. His publications and specimens resulted in many new taxa. He published his Flora japonica in 1784, and in 1788 he began to publish his travels. He completed his Prodromus plantarum in 1800, his Icones plantarum japonicarum in 1805, and his Flora capensis in 1813. He published numerous memoirs in the transactions of many Swedish and other scientific societies, of sixty-six of which he was an honorary member. In 1809 he became correspondent, and in 1823 associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. He died at Thunaberg near Uppsala on 8 August 1828.  Reasons for his travels  Although travels through Europe and to newly discovered countries were not uncommon during the Age of Enlightenment, the question why Thunberg chose the East Indies and particularly Japan as his destination remains. Moreover, even though the Enlightenment's \\"market of ideas\\" was rich of travelogues about Linnaeus unknown lands and cultures, Thunberg's account on Japan took an extraordinary position and was even translated into German, English and French.Skuncke, 2013, p. 261 Hence, many scholars have tried to determine the reasons for Thunberg's travel at that particular time and the outstanding success of his travelogue. Out of the relevant literature, three main explanations can be filtered out. # Next to being encouraged by Linnaeus and Gronovius to travel to Japan, the fact that for half a century, no new information on the mysterious country in the East had reached Europe attracted Thunberg to provide new insights on the Japanese. In 1690, Engelbert Kaempfer, a German traveller, had sailed to Japan and spent two years on the island of Deshima. Kaempfer's travelogue which was published in 1729 became a famous work on the shogunate; yet, when Thunberg came to Japan, Kaempfer's writings were already more than fifty years old.Rietbergen, P. (2004.) Becoming Famous in the Eighteenth Century: Carl Peter Thunberg Between Sweden, the Netherlands and Japan. De Achttiende Eeuw, 36 (1), pp. 50‚Äì61, p. 65Jung 2002, pp. 90‚Äì92 The time was right for new knowledge. # The Age of Enlightenment furthered this scientific hunger for new information. In the light of the increasing emphasis on using the rational human mind, many students were keen to leave the boundaries of Europe and apply their knowledge and gather new insights through empirical travels into the unknown. # Thunberg himself was a very inquisitive and intelligent man, a \\"person of acute mind\\" (Screech, 2012, p. 2) who always sought new challenges. Hence, undertaking the journey was in Thunberg's personal interest and complied well with his character. Thunbergia, thunbergii A genus of tropical plants (Thunbergia, family Acanthaceae), which are cultivated as evergreen climbers, is named after him. Thunberg is cited in naming some 254 species of both plants and animals (though significantly more plants than animals).

It was inspired by Ernst Heinkel's emphasis on research into high- speed flight and built on the company's experience with the He 178 jet prototype. A combination of technical and political factors led to it being passed over in favor of the Messerschmitt Me 262. Only nine were built and none reached operational status. Development The Heinkel company began the He 280 project on its own initiative after the He 178 had been met with indifference from the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (German, Reich Aviation Ministry, RLM). The head designer was Robert Lusser, who began the project under the designation He 180 in late 1939. It had a typical Heinkel fighter fuselage, elliptical wings and a dihedralled tailplane with twin fins and rudders. It had a tricycle undercarriage landing gear with very little ground clearance. This arrangement was considered too frail for the grass or dirt airfields of the era; however, the tricycle layout eventually gained acceptance. The He 280 was equipped with a compressed-air powered ejection seat, the first aircraft to carry one and the first aircraft to successfully employ one in an emergency. The first prototype was completed in the summer of 1940, but the HeS 8 intended to power it was running into difficulties. On 22 September 1940, while work on the engine continued, the first prototype started glide tests with ballasted pods hung in place of its engines. It was another six months before Fritz Sch√§fer flew the second prototype under its own power, on 30 March 1941. The type was then demonstrated to Ernst Udet, head of RLM's development wing, on 5 April, but like its predecessor, it apparently failed to make an impression. One benefit of the He 280 which did impress the political leadership was the fact that the jet engines could burn kerosene, which requires much less expense and refining than the high-octane fuel used by piston-engine aircraft. However, government funding was lacking at the critical stage of initial development. Over the next year, progress was slow due to the ongoing engine problems. A second engine design, the HeS 30 was also undergoing development, both as an interesting engine in its own right, as well as a potential replacement for the HeS 8. In the meantime, alternative powerplants were considered, including the Argus As 014 pulsejet that powered the V-1 flying bomb. It was proposed that up to eight be used. By the end of 1943, however, the third prototype was fitted with refined versions of the HeS 8 engine and was ready for its next demonstration. On 22 December, a mock dogfight was staged for RLM officials in which the He 280 was matched against an Fw 190, in which the jet demonstrated its vastly superior speed, completing four laps of an oval course before the Fw 190 could complete three. Finally, at this point the RLM became interested and placed an order for 20 pre-production test aircraft, to be followed by 300 production machines. Engine problems continued to plague the project. In 1942, the RLM had ordered Heinkel to abandon the HeS 8 and HeS 30 to focus all development on a follow- on engine, the HeS 011, a more advanced and problematic design. Meanwhile, the first He 280 prototype was re-equipped with pulsejets and towed aloft to test them. Bad weather caused the aircraft to ice up, and before the jets could be tested pilot Helmut Schenk became the first person to put an ejection seat to use. The seat worked perfectly, but the aircraft was lost and never found. With the HeS 011 not expected for some time, Heinkel selected the rival BMW 003. However, this engine also had problems and delays. The second He 280 prototype was re-engined with Junkers Jumo 004s while the next three airframes were earmarked for the BMW motor, which was ultimately unavailable. The Jumo engines were much larger and heavier than the HeS 8 that the plane had been designed for, and while it flew well enough on its first powered flights from 16 March 1943, it was clear that this engine was unsuitable. The aircraft was slower and generally less efficient than the Me 262. Less than two weeks later, on 27 March, Erhard Milch cancelled the project. The Jumo 004-powered Me 262 appeared to have most of the qualities of the He 280, but was better matched to its engine. Heinkel was ordered to abandon the He 280 and focus attention on bomber development and construction, something he remained bitter about until his death.

Born and raised in Edinburgh, he travelled to Europe as a young man, studying architecture in Rome under Piranesi. In 1758 he became the first Briton to win the triennial architecture competition at the Accademia di San Luca, which made his name known in London, and won him the rivalry of fellow Scot Robert Adam. On his return to Britain, Mylne won the competition to design the new Blackfriars Bridge over the Thames in London, his design being chosen over those of established engineers, such as John Smeaton. He was appointed surveyor to the New River Company, which supplied drinking water to London, and Surveyor of the Fabric of St Paul's Cathedral, where he was responsible for maintaining the building designed by Sir Christopher Wren. Both positions he held for life. Mylne designed a number of country houses and city buildings, as well as bridges. As his career progressed he concentrated more on engineering, writing reports on harbours and advising on canals, and appearing as an expert witness in lawsuits and trials. Mylne was one of the founder members, with John Smeaton, of the Society of Civil Engineers, the first engineering society in the world, established in 1771. He was also a founder of the Architects' Club, another early professional body, and regularly socialised with the eminent doctors, philosophers and scientists of his day. Known for his quick temper and for his integrity, Mylne had a strong sense of duty, and could be stubborn when he knew he was right. This inflexibility made him unpopular with some, in an age when corruption was more widespread than today. He died aged 78 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral. Early life Mylne was descended from a family of architects and builders, and was the great-grandson of mason and architect Robert Mylne (1633‚Äì1710), remembered particularly for his work as the King's Master Builder at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh. The younger Robert was born in Edinburgh, the son of Thomas Mylne, Edinburgh City Surveyor, and Deacon of the Incorporation of St Mary's Chapel, the main guild of masons in Edinburgh. He was educated at the Royal High School from the ages of nine to fourteen, after which he was apprenticed to Daniel Wright, a wright, or carpenter, for six years. During this time he probably also learned stonemasonry from his father. He undertook work for the Duke of Atholl at Blair Castle in Perthshire,Ward, pp.15‚Äì16 and was expected to take over the family business from his father.Ward, p.20 Grand tour In autumn 1754, Mylne set off for mainland Europe on the \\"Grand Tour\\", to join his brother William, who had been studying in Paris for a year. They travelled through France together, mostly on foot and by boat, visiting Avignon and Marseille, from where they sailed to Civitavecchia. Again travelling on foot, they arrived in Rome in January 1755, and took lodgings on the Via del Condotti. They made contact with Andrew Lumisden, secretary to James Stuart, the \\"Old Pretender\\",Ward, p.26 and Abb√© Peter Grant, the Scots agent in Rome. They also encountered Robert Adam, a fellow Scot also studying architecture. Adam was disdainful of the Mylnes' poor situation, but viewed Robert Mylne as a potential rival, noting that he \\"begins to draw extremely well\\". The Mylnes were continually short of funds, and had a joint allowance from their father of just ¬£45 a year, compared to Adam's annual expenditure of around ¬£800.Ward, p.29 Mylne learned architectural and figure drawing, and studied the art of architectural ornament, under the direction of Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Piranesi, who had also taught Robert Adam, was a great influence on the young Mylne, and the two continued to correspond after the latter left Rome. Mylne studied the Ancient Roman system of aqueducts, and began to take on paid work as a tutor himself.Ward, pp.33‚Äì34 A letter from the Duke of Atholl enquired when he would return to resume work at Blair, and offered Mylne the post of head carver, but he preferred to continue with his studies.Ward, p.27 In the spring of 1757, shortly after William had returned home, Mylne accompanied the diplomat Richard Phelps and antiquarian Matthew Nulty on a tour of Sicily. He produced sketches and measured drawings of the antiquities for a projected book, although this was never published.Fleming, pp.356‚Äì366 In 1758, Mylne decided to enter the triennial architecture competition, known as the Concorso Clementino, at the Accademia di San Luca (St Luke's Academy), the subject being a design for a public gallery. He prepared two sets of drawings over seven months, apparently rejecting the first, and submitting the latter.Ward, pp.35‚Äì39 This, the winning design, was heavily influenced by French neoclassical architecture, which helped it to stand out against the field of mostly baroque entries.Summerson, p.382 On 6 September, all the entrants had to complete a prova, a drawing exercise under examination conditions, and on 18 September 1758, Mylne was awarded a silver medal, as the first Briton ever to win the competition. He was presented the award at a ceremony attended by twenty cardinals, as well as James Stuart, the Old Pretender, who was referred to in Rome as \\"King James III of England\\". The event was publicised by his family in Edinburgh and London, and he acquired the patronage of the Prince Altieri, who arranged for his election to the Academy. Mylne left Rome in April 1759, travelling to Florence, where he was elected to the Academy of Art, then Venice, Brescia, and villas designed by Andrea Palladio. He then travelled through Germany to Rotterdam, arriving in London on 17 July 1759. Blackfriars Bridge under construction in 1764, engraved by Piranesi Blackfriars Bridge Mylne intended to establish himself as an architect in London, and to begin preparing his notes and sketches of Sicily for publication. However, on his arrival, he heard of the proposal to build a third bridge over the River Thames at Blackfriars. The closing date for the design competition was set for 4 October, giving Mylne less than three months to complete his scheme, although in his favour, he apparently found a friend in John Paterson, secretary of the Bridge Committee, and a fellow Scot.Ward, p.45 69 schemes were entered into the competition, which was soon reduced to a shortlist of 14, including designs by the established engineers John Smeaton and John Gwynn, and the architects Sir William Chambers and George Dance the Elder. Mylne's design stood out, however, as it was the only one to propose flatter, elliptical arches, rather than round ones. This departure, as yet untried in Britain, provoked a public debate, and brought Mylne under attack from Dr Samuel Johnson, a friend of John Gwynn, who suggested that elliptical arches would be too weak. In response Mylne published a pamphlet, under the name \\"Publicus\\", in which the pseudonymous author praises Mylne's design, while criticising those of his competitors.Ward, p.49-55 On 22 February 1760, Mylne was finally declared the winner of the competition, and he was appointed surveyor to the new Blackfriars Bridge, with overall responsibility for design, construction and future maintenance of the structure, on a salary of ¬£400 a year.Ward, p.61 The foundation stone was laid on 31 October, and on 1 October 1764 the first arch, the wide centre arch, was completed.Ward, p.75 Mylne corresponded with Piranesi regarding the project, and the latter made an engraving, based on Mylne's reports, of the bridge under construction. Mylne introduced several technical innovations, including the use of removable wedges in the centring which supported the arches during construction, making it easier to dismantle. The foundations of the piers were on timber piles, levelled with an underwater saw, and the stonework was then built inside a huge caisson, a floating, submersible workspace, by , and high.Ward, pp.68‚Äì74 Mylne's obelisk at St George's Circus, 1771 The bridge was opened to all traffic in November 1769. As surveyor, Mylne was also responsible for laying out the approach roads; Bridge Street (now New Bridge Street) from the north, and Surrey Street (now Blackfriars Road) from the south. The squares of Chatham Square and Albion Place were laid out at the north and south ends of the bridge, respectively, and Mylne also designed the obelisk, which still stands, at St George's Circus, in 1771.Ward, p.76 Although Mylne was briefly the target of satirical anti-Scots cartoons and pamphlets at the time of winning the competition,Ward, p.58 the completed bridge was universally well-received, and tolls repaid the ¬£152,840 cost of building within a few years. Mylne received his final payment for the works, of ¬£4,209, in 1776,Ward, p.105 and held the post of surveyor until his death, but the bridge had to be replaced in 1869, after the rebuilding of London Bridge in 1831 affected the flow of the river.Ward, p.77 The Wick, Richmond, 1775 Architecture Despite these early successes, Mylne never won the acclaim of his contemporaries Robert Adam (1728‚Äì1792) and William Chambers (1723‚Äì1796). Although he became a successful architect, he played only a minor role in the development of neoclassical architecture, which was led by Adam and Chambers.Summerson, pp.382, 410 Mylne followed the French style of neoclassicism, rather than the \\"Adam style\\", and his work was also influenced by the post-Palladian buildings of English architect Isaac Ware (1704‚Äì1766). Mylne's influence on British architecture was limited, although the Irish architect Thomas Cooley (1740‚Äì1784) was Mylne's clerk at Blackfriars, and later produced designs which show the influence of Mylne's competition-winning Rome design.Summerson, p.412 Mylne designed a number of town houses and country houses, and a few public buildings. The first new country house was Cally, in Galloway, south-west Scotland, for James Murray of Broughton. Mylne had met Murray in Rome, and drew a set of plans while still there, although the house was built to a modified design.Ward, p.86 His largest country house was Tusmore, Oxfordshire, built in a Palladian style between 1766 and 1769 for William Fermor. Of his small town houses, the most successful is The Wick, in Richmond. Designed in 1775 for Lady St Aubyn, the house has oval dining and drawing rooms. From 1794 to 1797 Mylne built a house for himself, The Grove, at Great Amwell.Ward, p.154 City of London Lying-in Hospital, 1770‚Äì1773 St Cecilia's Hall in Edinburgh was one of Mylne's first public buildings, built 1761‚Äì1763 for the Musical Society of Edinburgh. The oval, domed hall survives as part of Edinburgh University.Gifford, et al. p.187 Mylne's design for the City of London Lying-in Hospital, built 1770‚Äì1773, comprised a high central cupola flanked by pedimented blocks.Summerson, p.411 Another public building, Stationers' Hall in London, was among his last architectural works, being refronted by him in 1800.Ward, p.168 One or Mylne's earliest works for a private client was for Edward Southwell (1705‚Äì1755) whom he is reputed to have met in Rome when Southwell was on the Grand Tour and Mylne was there studying under Piranesi. Mylne's first work at Kings Weston House was in 1763 and involved designing and extensive new stables and kitchen garden complex which still remain. In the years following Mylne worked on extensively modernising Kings Weston House and replacing Sir John Vanbrugh's austere interiors. Here he created a suite of neo-classical rooms surrounding the remodelled Sallon which he filled with family portraits in refined carved architectural surrounds. His final work for Southwell was for a lodge house in 1768, the drawing for which he gave to his client. In 1766, Mylne was appointed Surveyor to St Paul's Cathedral, completed by Sir Christopher Wren some 55 years earlier. Nominated by the Lord Mayor of London, his salary was ¬£50 a year.Ward, p.89 In this capacity, Mylne was responsible for erecting a monument to Wren, whose only memorial at the time was in the basement. The existing Latin epitaph, Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice (reader, if you seek his monument, look around you), was re-used on a tablet mounted on the organ screen in 1810, although this was destroyed in the Blitz.Ward, pp.172‚Äì173 He purchased over 200 of Wren's drawings, with his own money, and had them bound and presented to the Cathedral, thus recording the building's history for posterity. On the death of Lord Nelson at Trafalgar in 1805, Mylne was partly responsible for the state funeral, building Nelson's sarcophagus in the Cathedral basement, although the design of the monument fell to James Wyatt of the Office of Works.Ward, pp.177‚Äì178 Mylne, together with the manufacturer Matthew Boulton, arranged for a secret deposit of commemorative medals, of Boulton's making, to be placed inside the sarcophagus prior to Nelson's interment.Ward, pp.181‚Äì189 Mylne's drawing of King William's Court, Greenwich Hospital In November 1775 he was also appointed clerk of works at Greenwich Hospital, another Wren building, under the surveyor James Stuart.Ward, p.111 At Greenwich he cleared unsightly workshops from the grounds, and laid out a series of walkways. He was later accused by the Lieutenant Governor, Captain Baillie, of misusing funds and occupying space required by the Hospital's pensioners. Mylne responded by accusing Baillie of corruption, and the ensuing enquiry vindicated Mylne and led to the dismissal of Baillie in 1778.Ward, pp.113‚Äì117 A fire the following January destroyed the chapel, but Mylne and his superior, James Stuart, failed to work together to design and build a replacement. Mylne made frequent requests to Stuart for drawings, but Stuart, who was gaining a reputation for drunkenness and unreliability,Ward, p.131 accused Mylne again of corruption and insulting behaviour. A second investigation again found no evidence, but it was clear that Mylne and Stuart could not work together. Stuart was the established figure, so it was Mylne, as the junior partner, who was dismissed. Disgusted at the outcome, he had to be forced from his offices, and successfully sued for damages.Ward, pp.128‚Äì133 He served as surveyor to Canterbury Cathedral. Engineering From 1767 until his death, Mylne worked for the New River Company, whose head offices were adjacent to Blackfriars Bridge. He was initially hired as an assistant to the company surveyor Henry Mill, but took over on Mill's death in 1769. The Company's offices burned down at Christmas of that year, offering Mylne the opportunity to design a replacement.Ward, p90-91 Later, Mylne designed and erected a monument to Sir Hugh Myddelton, designer of the New River, at Great Amwell. He was also involved in the development of the Eau Brink Cut, a new channel for the River Great Ouse in East Anglia.

William was commissioned to build Edinburgh's new North Bridge later in the decade, but the structure partially collapsed in 1769, killing five people. Robert was one of his brother's financial guarantors, and was involved in the subsequent problems for several years, until William, his architectural career over, fled to America in 1773. He returned two years later, at which time Robert obtained him a job running the Dublin Waterworks. On William's death in 1790, Robert had a plaque erected to his memory in St Catherine's Church, Dublin.Ward, p.153 In September 1770, Robert married Mary Home, the daughter of an army surgeon, leading to a rift between Mylne and his sister, who disliked the Home family. The couple resided at the Water House, New River Head, and had nine children: *Maria (1772‚Äì1794) *Emilia (born 1773) *Harriet (born 1774) *Caroline (born 1775), married Colonel Duncan of the East India Company, 1797 *Robert (1779‚Äì1798) *William Chadwell (1781‚Äì1863) *Thomas (1782, died aged six months) *Charlotte (born 1785) *Leonora (born 1788) Mary Mylne died of a lung complaint in July 1797, shortly after the family had moved to Great Amwell.Ward, p.161 Robert designed a mausoleum for his wife and family, which still stands in the churchyard of St John the Baptist.Ward, p.171 Burials in the vault included his descendant, the antiquarian Rev Robert Scott Mylne FRSE (1854‚Äì1920). Robert junior was initially intended for an architectural career, and was apprenticed to Henry Holland. However, this was unsuccessful, and Robert joined the army as an Ensign in 1797. Sailing for Gibraltar, his ship was captured, and he spent the following year in a French prison. Setting out again for Gibraltar after his return, he died on board ship in December 1798.Ward, pp.162‚Äì163 It was therefore William's role to take over from his father, which he did, being appointed surveyor to the New River on his father's retirement in 1810.Ward, p.197 References *Fleming, John (1968) Robert Adam and his Circle.

He was the first composer to receive an Honorary Academy Award, but never won a competitive Oscar despite fourteen nominations. Early life North was born Isadore Soifer in Chester, Pennsylvania, US, to Russian Jewish parents. Career North managed to integrate his modernism into typical film music leitmotif structure, rich with themes. One of these became the famous song, \\"Unchained Melody\\". Nominated for fifteen Oscars but unsuccessful each time, North is one of only two film composers to receive the Lifetime Achievement Academy Award, the other being Ennio Morricone. North's frequent collaborator as orchestrator was the avant-garde composer Henry Brant. He won the 1968 Golden Globe award for his music to The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968). His best-known film scores include A Streetcar Named Desire, Death of a Salesman, Viva Zapata!, The Rainmaker, Spartacus, The Misfits, Cleopatra, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Dragonslayer and Under the Volcano. His music for The Wonderful Country makes use of Mexican and American motifs. His commissioned score for 2001: A Space Odyssey is notorious for having been discarded by director Stanley Kubrick. Although North later incorporated motifs from the rejected score for The Shoes of the Fisherman, Shanks and Dragonslayer, the score itself remained unheard until composer Jerry Goldsmith rerecorded it for Var√®se Sarabande in 1993. In 2007, Intrada Records released the 1968 recording sessions on CD from North's personal archives. North was also commissioned to write a jazz score for Nero Wolfe, a 1959 CBS-TV series based on Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe characters, starring William Shatner as Archie Goodwin and Kurt Kasznar as Nero Wolfe.The Billboard, April 20, 1959, pp. 38 + 40 A pilot and two or three episodes were filmed, but the designated time slot was, in the end, given to another series.Shepard, Richard F., The New York Times, April 9, 1959Ewald, William F., Television in Review (syndicated column), April 9, 1959 North's unheard score for Nero Wolfe and six recorded tracks on digital audio tape are in the UCLA Music Library Special Collections.Wrobel, Bill, Film Score Rundowns, \\"CBS Collection 072 UCLA,\\" Blog 42, June 25, 2010. The film score researcher identifies 30 CBS digital audio tapes in the UCLA Music Library Special Collections (p. 168), with tracks 86‚Äì91 of DAT #11 being the Nero Wolfe music of Alex North (p. 174). The score, CPN5912, is in Box #105 (p. 51). He also wrote the music for various other television shows, such as the anthologies Climax! and Playhouse 90. Though North is best known for his work in Hollywood, he spent years in New York writing music for the stage; he composed the score, for the original Broadway production of Death of a Salesman. It was in New York that he met Elia Kazan (director of Salesman), who brought him to Hollywood in the 1950s. North was one of several composers who brought the influence of contemporary concert music into film, in part marked by an increased use of dissonance and complex rhythms. But there is also a lyrical quality to much of his work which may be connected to the influence of Aaron Copland, with whom he studied. His classical works include two symphonies and a Rhapsody for Piano, Trumpet obbligato and Orchestra. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for his score for the 1976 television miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man, and went on to score the sequel Rich Man, Poor Man Book II and the 1978 miniseries The Word. North is also known for his opening to the CBS television anthology series Playhouse 90 and the 1965 ABC television miniseries FDR. He was recognized for his lifetime achievement in 2004 from the Sammy Film Music Awards. In 2016, the Library of Congress added North's 1951 recording of his score to \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" to its National Recording Registry. North died on September 8, 1991 in Los Angeles, California. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea. Awards The American Film Institute ranked North's score for A Streetcar Named Desire #19 on their list of the greatest film scores. His scores for the following films were also nominated for the list: *Cleopatra (1963) *The Misfits (1961) *Spartacus (1960) *Viva Zapata! (1952) *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) North was nominated for fifteen Academy Awards throughout his career, one for Best Original Song, the rest in the Best Original Score category, making him the most-nominated composer to have never won. He was however awarded an Honorary Academy Award in 1986; he was the first composer to receive it. *Winner - Honorary Oscar for memorable achievement in a host of distinguished motion pictures (1986) *Nominated - Under the Volcano (1984) *Nominated - Dragonslayer (1981) *Nominated - Bite the Bullet (1975) *Nominated - Shanks (1974) *Nominated - The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) *Nominated - Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Intended as the introduction to the more philosophical poem The Recluse, which Wordsworth never finished, The Prelude is an extremely personal work and reveals many details of Wordsworth's life. Wordsworth began The Prelude in 1798, at the age of 28, and continued to work on it throughout his life. He never gave it a title, but called it the \\"Poem (title not yet fixed upon) to Coleridge\\" in his letters to his sister Dorothy Wordsworth. The poem was unknown to the general public until the final version was published three months after Wordsworth's death in 1850. Its present title was given to it by his widow Mary. Versions There are three versions of the poem: * The 1799 Prelude, called the Two-Part Prelude, composed 1798‚Äì1799, containing the first two parts of the later poem. * The 1805 Prelude, which was found and printed by Ernest de S√©lincourt in 1926, in 13 books. * The 1850 Prelude, published shortly after Wordsworth's death, in 14 books. The Prelude was the product of a lifetime: for the last part of his life Wordsworth had been \\"polishing the style and qualifying some of its radical statements about the divine sufficiency of the human mind in its communion with nature\\".The Norton Anthology of English Literature 323. Structure: The Prelude and The Recluse The poem was intended as the prologue to a long three-part epic and philosophical poem, The Recluse. Though Wordsworth planned this project when he was in his late 20s, he went to his grave at 80 years old having written to some completion only The Prelude and the second part (The Excursion), and leaving no more than fragments of the rest. Wordsworth initially planned to write this work together with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, their joint intent being to surpass John Milton's Paradise Lost (Table Talk II.70‚Äì71; IG3). If The Recluse had been completed, it would have been about three times longer than Paradise Lost (33,000 lines versus 10,500). Wordsworth often commented in his letters that he was plagued with agony because he had failed to finish the work. In his introduction to the version of 1850 Wordsworth explains that the original idea, inspired by his \\"dear friend\\" Coleridge, was \\"to compose a philosophical Poem, containing views of Man, Nature, and Society, and to be entitled the Recluse; as having for its principal subject, the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement\\".The Poems of William Wordsworth 237. Coleridge's inspiration and interest is evident in his letters. For instance, in 1799 he wrote to Wordsworth: \\"I am anxiously eager to have you steadily employed on 'The Recluse'... I wish you would write a poem, in blank verse, addressed to those who, in consequence of the complete failure of the French Revolution, have thrown up all hopes of amelioration of mankind, and are sinking into an almost Epicurean selfishness, disguising the same under the soft titles of domestic attachment and contempt for visionary philosophies. It would do great good, and might form a Part of 'The Recluse'.\\" (STC to WW, Sept. 1799). Wordsworth pays tribute to Coleridge in his introduction to the edition of 1850: \\"work [is] addressed to a dear friend, most distinguished for his knowledge and genius, and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted.\\" Literary criticism of The Prelude According to Monique R. Morgan's \\"Narrative Means to Lyric Ends in Wordsworth's Prelude,\\" \\"Much of the poem consists of Wordsworth's interactions with nature that 'assure[d] him of his poetic mission.' The goal of the poem is to demonstrate his fitness to produce great poetry, and The Prelude itself becomes evidence of that fitness.\\" It traces the growth of the poet's mind by stressing the mutual consciousness and spiritual communion between the world of nature and man.

Its focus and mood present a sharp and fundamental fall away from the neoclassical and into the Romantic. Milton, who is mentioned by name in line 181 of Book One, rewrote God's creation and The Fall of Man in Paradise Lost in order to \\"justify the ways of God to men,\\" Wordsworth chooses his own mind and imagination as a subject worthy of epic. This spiritual autobiography evolves out of Wordsworth's \\"persistent metaphor [that life is] a circular journey whose end is 'to arrive where we started / And know that place for the first time' (T. S. Eliot, Little Gidding, lines 241-42). The Prelude opens with a literal journey [during his manhood] whose chosen goal [...] is the Vale of Grasmere. The Prelude narrates a number of later journeys, most notably the crossing of the Alps in Book VI and, in the beginning of the final book, the climactic ascent of Snowdon. In the course of the poem, such literal journeys become the metaphorical vehicle for a spiritual journey‚Äîthe quest within the poet's memory [...]\\".

Hasselquist was born at T√∂rnevalla, which is two kilometers east of Linghem, √ñsterg√∂tland. He studied under Carl Linnaeus at Uppsala University and became one of the \\"Apostles of Linnaeus\\". On account of the frequently expressed regrets of Carl Linnaeus at the lack of information regarding the natural history of Levant, Hasselquist resolved to undertake a journey to that country. With a sufficient subscription having been obtained to defray expenses, he reached Smyrna towards the end of 1749. He visited parts of Asia Minor, Egypt, Cyprus and the Land of Israel, making large natural history collections, but his constitution, naturally weak, gave way under the fatigues of travel, and he died near Smyrna on his way home. His collections reached home in safety, and five years after his death his notes were published by Linnaeus under the title Iter Pal√¶stinum, Eller Resa til Heliga Landet, F√∂rr√§ttad Ifr√•n √•r 1749 til 1752, which was translated into French and German in 1762 and into English in 1766 (as Voyages and Travels in the Levant, in the Years 1749, 50, 51, 52).

Both the Palais de Chaillot, housing the Mus√©e de l'Homme, and the Palais de Tokyo, which houses the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, were created for this exhibition that was officially sanctioned by the Bureau International des Expositions. Exhibitions The Soviet pavilion and the German pavilion near the Eiffel Tower At first the centerpiece of the exposition was to be a tower (\\"Phare du Monde\\") which was to have a spiraling road to a parking garage located at the top and a hotel and restaurant located above that. The idea was abandoned as it was far too expensive.  Pavilions =Pavillon des Temps Nouveaux The Pavillon des Temps Nouveaux (Pavilion of New Times) was a tent pavilion designed by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret. Canadian Pavilion Fitting in the architectural master-plan of the master architect Jacques Gr√©ber at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, and inspired by the shape of a grain elevator, the Canadian pavilion included Joseph-√âmile Brunet's 28-foot sculpture of a buffalo (1937). Paintings by Brunet, sculpted panels on the outside of the structure, and several thematic stands inside the Canadian pavilion depicted aspects of Canadian culture.Evrard, Guillaume (2010) ‚ÄúProducing and Consuming Agricultural Capital: The Aesthetics and Cultural Politics of Grain Elevators at the 1937 Paris International Exposition‚Äù in Balfour, Robert J.

The organization of the world exhibition had placed the German and the Soviet pavilions directly across from each other. Hitler had desired to withdraw from participation, but his architect Albert Speer convinced him to participate after all, showing Hitler his plans for the German pavilion. Speer later revealed in his autobiographies that he had had a clandestine look at the plans for the Soviet pavilion, and had designed the German pavilion to represent a bulwark against Communism. The preparation and construction of the exhibits were plagued by delay. On the opening day of the exhibition, only the German and the Soviet pavilions had been completed. This, as well as the fact that the two pavilions faced each other, turned the exhibition into a competition between the two great ideological rivals. Speer's pavilion was culminated by a tall tower crowned with the symbols of the Nazi state: an eagle and the swastika. The pavilion was conceived as a monument to \\"German pride and achievement\\". It was to broadcast to the world that a new and powerful Germany had a restored sense of national pride. At night, the pavilion was illuminated by floodlights. Josef Thorak's sculpture Comradeship stood outside the pavilion, depicting two enormous nude males, clasping hands and standing defiantly side by side, in a pose of mutual defense and \\"racial camaraderie\\". Map of the exhibition Soviet Pavilion The architect of the Soviet pavilion was Boris Iofan. Vera Mukhina designed the large figurative sculpture on the pavilion. The grand building was topped by Worker and Kolkhoz Woman, a large momentum-exerting statue, of a male worker and a female peasant, their hands together, thrusting a hammer and a sickle. The statue was meant to symbolize the union of workers and peasants. Italian Pavilion Italy was vying for attention between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union who presented themselves as great (and opposing) forces to be reckoned with. Italy was the benevolent dictatorship: sunny, open and Mediterranean it was founded on discipline, order and unity. Marcello Piacentini was given the job of designing the pavilion exterior. He used a modern reinforced concrete frame combined with traditional elements such as colonnades, terraces, courts and galleries, the tower form, Classical rhythms and the use of Mediterranean marble and stucco. The pavilion was nestled under the Eiffel tower looking out over the Seine to the main part of the Exposition site. Giuseppe Pagano was responsible for the overall co-ordination of the exhibits and was the first impact on entering the building, its large courtyard garden and its hall of honour. The main entry was through the Court of Honour that showcased life size examples of Italy's most important contribution to the history of technology. Arturo Martini's Victory of the Air presided over the space, her dark bronze form standing out against a seemingly infinite backdrop of blue- grey Venetian mosaic tiles. From there visitors could visit the Colonial Exhibits by Mario Sironi and the Gallery of Tourism before enjoying a plate of real spaghetti on the restaurant terrace. The courtyard garden was designed a respite from the exhibits with a symphony of green grass and green-glazed tiles set against red flowers and burgundy porphyry. The Hall of Honour was the pavilion's most dramatic and evocative space. It also 'repurposed' an existing artwork: Mario Sironi's Corporative Italy (Fascist Work) mosaic from the 1936 Triennale that had now been completed with numerous figures engaged in different types of work and the figure of the imperial Roman eagle flying in from the right hand side. The 8m x 12 m work towered over the two-storey height space that occupied the top of the pavilion's tower, making it the centre piece of the pavilion's decorative and propaganda program. The enthroned figure of Italy represented Corporatism ‚Äì the successful economic policy that merged the best of Capitalism and the best of Communism ‚Äì and that had, up until then proved a success. The room was a celebration of all those aspects of Fascist society that Pagano wholeheartedly believed in: social harmony, government input to generate industrial innovation and support for artists, professionals and craftsmen as well as workers. Here Pagano had the joy of working alongside five different artists and placing Italy's newest industrial material such as linoleum and Termolux (shatterproof plate glass) next to a sumptuous chandelier from Murano and amber marble.F. Marcello, \\"Italians do it Better: Fascist Italy‚Äôs New Brand of Nationalism in the Art and Architecture of the Italian Pavilion, Paris 1937\\" in Rika Devos, Alexander Ortenberg, Vladimir Paperny eds., Architecture of Great Expositions 1937‚Äì1958: Reckoning with the Global War, Ashgate Press, 2015, 51‚Äì70. British Pavilion Britain had not been expecting such a competitive exposition, and its planned budget was only a small fraction of Germany's. Frank Pick, the chairman of the Council for Art and Industry, appointed Oliver Hill as architect but told him to avoid modernism and to focus on traditional crafts. The main architectural element of Hill's pavilion was a large white box, decorated externally with a painted frieze by John Skeaping and internally with giant photographic figures which included Neville Chamberlain fishing. Its contents were crafts objects arranged according to English words which had become loanwords in French, such as \\"sport\\" and \\"weekend\\", and included some items by renowned potter William Worrall. There was considerable British criticism that the result was unrepresentative of Britain and compared poorly to the other pavilions' projections of national strength. Awards *At the presentation, both Speer and Iofan, who also designed the Palace of Soviets that was planned to be constructed in Moscow, were awarded gold medals for their respective designs.

He is remembered both for several well-known Messerschmitt and Heinkel designs during World War II, and after the war for his theoretical study of the reliability of complex systems. In the post-war era, Lusser also pioneered the development of modern ski bindings, introducing the first teflon anti-friction pads to improve release. Biography Lusser was born in Ulm. As a pilot, he won the International Light Aircraft Contest in France in 1928. Next he participated in three out of four FAI International Tourist Plane Contests, flying Klemm aircraft, and completed all three taking quite high places (Challenge 1929: 4th, Challenge 1930: 13th, and Challenge 1932: 10th).Marian Krzy≈ºan: Miƒôdzynarodowe turnieje lotnicze 1929-1934, WKi≈Å, Warsaw 1988, In August 1930 he was 3rd in the handicapped race Giro Aereo d'Italia in Italy.Circuit of Italy in Flight, September 5, 1930, p.991 Lusser's first jobs were with the Klemm and Heinkel companies, before joining the newly relaunched Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (Bavarian Aircraft Works) in 1933. There, he assisted Willy Messerschmitt with his design for a touring aircraft, the Messerschmitt M37. This was later put into production as the Messerschmitt Bf 108, and formed the basis for the company's best known product, the Bf 109 fighter aircraft. By 1934, Lusser was head of Messerschmitt's design bureau and in charge of the Bf 110 heavy fighter project. In 1938 the company was renamed Messerschmitt. Lusser stayed with the company until 1938, when he returned to Heinkel. There, he led the design of two highly sophisticated aircraft that never reached their full potential - the He 280 and the He 219. The He 280 was the first jet fighter to leave the drawing board, but which the RLM (Reichsluftfahrtministerium - \\"Reich Aviation Ministry\\") passed over in favour of the Messerschmitt Me 262. The He 219 was an advanced night-fighter design that was rejected by the RLM in August 1941 as being too complex to order into production because of its many innovations. Ernst Heinkel immediately dismissed Lusser and resubmitted a simplified design that eventually saw limited production. From Heinkel, Lusser went to Fieseler, and there became involved with the company's efforts to produce a pilotless aircraft, initially designated the Fi 103. This was a collaborative effort between the company and engine manufacturer Argus, who were developing a pulsejet. Lusser worked with Argus engineer Fritz Gosslau to refine the design. The project was an initiative of the two companies, begun by Argus as early as 1934, and received little official interest until Erhard Milch recognised its potential in 1942 and assigned it high priority. Nazi propaganda dubbed this flying bomb the V1, (Vergeltungswaffe - \\"revenge weapon\\"). It was a design competing with Wernher von Braun' s \\"V2\\" vertical takeoff rocket. Despite initial demonstrations before Luftwaffe made the V2 look more reliable, it was decided both designs should proceed into production. Lusser and von Braun were rivals, and even later their relationship was never frictionless. Near Wolfsburg, Lusser found the main design flaw of his rocket, which turned out to be an underdimensioned main wing spar, as the ramp up of production began. From there on, the design worked. Post war time Like many important German engineers, Lusser was brought to the United States after the end of World War II. There, he worked for the Navy, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and in 1953, re-joined von Braun's rocketry team at Huntsville, Alabama. During his six years there, he formalised his theories of reliability, which focus on the contribution that the reliability of each part makes to the reliability of an overall system. This is now known as Lusser's Law. Based on these calculations, he pronounced that von Braun's ambitions of reaching the Moon and Mars were doomed to failure because of the complexity of the spacecraft required. He returned to Germany, and to the Messerschmitt company, by then, Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow. His alarming reliability study of the adaptations that the company was making to the F-104 Starfighter that it was building under licence turned out to be tragically correct. In 1961 he ruptured his Achilles tendon while testing his ski's cable bindings in his hotel room at Saas-Fee. He decided to attack the binding problem, developing the first bindings that gripped the toe of the boot, rather than the flange projecting from the front of the sole at the toe. This allowed the toe binding to release in any direction. In 1963 he quit his job at Messerschmitt to start the Lusser Binding Company.\\"Release!\\", Skiing Heritage, Fall 2002 This was a major brand until his death in 1969.

The Canig√≥ is located less than from the sea and has an elevation of . Due to its sharp flanks and its dramatic location near the coast, until the 18th century the Canigou was believed to be the highest mountain in the Pyrenees.Histoire du Roussillon - Le relief des Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales Being between south and Northern Catalonia, the mountain has a historical symbolical significance for Catalan people.  Geography  The Canig√≥ is located in Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, south of Prades and north of Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste. Its summit lies on the border between two communes: Vernet-les-Bains and Taurinya (although the territories of two other communes - Casteil and Valmanya - approach quite closely to the summit).Pierre Bousigue, Canigou - de l'ombre √† la lumi√®re, 2019, p118 Its location makes it visible from the plains of Roussillon and from Conflent in France, and as well from Empord√† in Spain.Guide du Roussillon et de l'Andorre : touristique, historique, social, √©conomique, Perpignan, Sud Roussillon, 1968, 286 p. Twice a year, in early February and at the end of October, with good weather, the Canig√≥ can be seen at sunset from as far as Marseille, away, by refraction of light. This phenomenon was observed in 1808 by baron Franz Xaver von Zach from the Notre- Dame de la Garde basilica in Marseille. All year long, it can also be seen, with good weather, from Agde, Port-Camargue and the Montagne Noire. Trekking and sightseeing Jeep tracks on the north side of the massif lead to the Chalet des Cortalets (at 2150 m) which is a popular outpost with walkers. There are two ancient monasteries at the foot of the mountain, Martin-du- Canigou and Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa. Canig√≥ Flame The mountain has symbolical significance for Catalan people. On its summit stands a cross that is often decorated with the Catalan flag.Pyr√©n√©es Team - Croix du Canig√≥ Every year on 23 June, the night before St. John's day (nit de Sant Joan), there is a ceremony called Flama del Canig√≥ (Canigou Flame), where a fire is lit at the mountaintop. People keep a vigil during the night and take torches lit on the fire in a spectacular torch relay to light bonfires elsewhere.Vermut a la rebuda de la Flama del Canig√≥ Many bonfires are lit in this way all over the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, Catalonia, Valencian Community, and Balearic Islands (theoretically), but in practice only goes through the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales and Catalonia.Festes - l'espai on comen√ßa la festa Literature The Canig√≥ inspired the epic poem \\"Canig√≥\\" by Catalan poet Jacint Verdaguer i Santal√≥. In these verses Verdaguer compares the snowy mountain to a Magnolia flower (pages 27‚Äì28): Sir Humphry Davy's \\"The Canigou\\", dated 26 January [1814], was also inspired by a visit to the spot: ::MORNING. ::In the eastern sky the stars their lustre lose ::In more diffused light, as if their orbs ::Had melted into air, and form'd the day: ::Above, the heavens receive a brighter tint ::Of purest azure; and beneath they glow ::With lovely hues, which every instant change, ‚Äî ::Now purple and now orange; and a gleam ::Of golden light pours on the tranquil main. ::I cast my eyes upon thy western coast, ::And lo! thy giant form, O Canigou! ::As if a new creation of the day, ::Framed of the morning cloud for ever fix'd, ::And gilded by the expiring morning star. ::So bright thy glittering snows appear, they seem ::To form another dawn: thy base is dark, ::Rising through mists that mingle with the wave! ::NOON. ::The orb of light its flood of lustre pours ::From the mid-heavens upon the tranquil sea ::Without a tide, whose silver mirror spreads, ::Reflecting forms of mountain-majesty ::Along the Iberian coast; and, more remote, ::In gentle agitation feels the breeze, ::That to its deep and lovely azure gives ::The life of motion. All the morning mists ::Have vanished, and the mid-day sunbeams sleep ::Upon thy snows, or glitter where the streams ::They feed with crystal waters pour in foam ::Amidst thy dark deep glens and shaggy woods, ::Where the bright pine and darker cork trees blend: ::Their varied foliage forms a boundary ::Where winter seems to mingle with the spring. ::And lower still, the olive tree appears ‚Äî ::The work of culture, and the leafless vine, ::And the green meadows, where the torrents sleep, ::Or move obedient to the wants of man. ::Nature in savage wildness ‚Äî mountain strength, ‚Äî ::Breathes in one picture with the forms of art, ::And all that stamp the social character. ::A city's walls majestically rise, ::The guardian of a realm whose sounds of war ::Alarm the ear. Along the sandy shore ::The path the Carthaginian trod appears, ::When from the Pyrenees his veterans pour'd, ::To try the strength of Rome, and shed profuse ::Her patriot blood at Cannae. On the wave ::Triumphant ride the fleets of Ocean's Queen. ::My heart throbs quicker, and a healthful glow ::Fills all my bosom. Albion, thee I hail! ‚Äî ::Mother of heroes! mighty in thy strength! ::Deliverer! from thee the fire proceeds ::Withering the tyrant; not a fire alone ::Of war destructive, but a living light ::Of honour, glory, and security, ‚Äî ::A light of science, liberty, and peace! ::EVENING. ::A moment past the sky was bright and clear, ::But now a mist obscures the ambient air; ::The mist becomes a cloud, which gathers round ::Thy brow; at first so white, ‚Äî so bright, so pure, ‚Äî ::The snows seem dark beneath its crisped fringe; ::And now it spreads a thicker canopy, ::And rapidly descends, and fills thy glens, ::And covers all thy rocks. Its tints are changed, ::Its fleecy whiteness gone; the sunbeams fade, ::And lose their glory in its sullen gloom, ::Portentous of the storm! And now the rain ::Descends in floods ‚Äî the angry lightning gleams, ::The thunder roars; the tempest howls along ::Thy echoing cliffs; and the vexed main ::Mingles her white foam with the troubled floods, ::The torrents from the mountains rolling down!

For a series of N components, this is expressed as: :R_s=\\\\prod_{i=1}^N r_i=r_1 \\\\times r_2 \\\\times r_3 \\\\times ... \\\\times r_n where Rs is the overall reliability of the system, and rn is the reliability of the nth component.

The game is not a direct adaptation of the 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner, but is instead a \\"sidequel\\", telling an original story, which runs parallel to the film's plot, occasionally intersecting with it. Set in 2019 Los Angeles, the game tells the story of Ray McCoy, an elite detective charged with hunting down a group of dangerous replicants (bioengineered androids designed to look and act like humans). Although several of the film's characters appear in the game, with some of the original actors returning to voice them, the film's protagonist, Rick Deckard, does not appear in a speaking role. Instead, he is referred to on multiple occasions, is seen several times, and his activities as depicted in the film are mentioned. Other parallels with the film include the reproduction of several prominent locations, as well as scenes and dialogue closely modelled on the original. The game also features extracts from the film's soundtrack. Blade Runner was advertised as a \\"real-time 3D adventure game,\\" since it was one of the first adventure games to use both 3D character rendering and a game world which progressed in real-time (as opposed to waiting for the player's actions). Unlike many games of its time, which used polygon-based renderers exploiting 3D accelerators, Westwood opted for their own software-based renderer using voxel technology. The game received generally positive reviews, and was a commercial success, selling over one million units worldwide. It went on to win the Interactive Achievement Award for \\"Computer Adventure Game of the Year,\\" and was nominated for \\"Best Adventure Game\\" by PC Gamer. Virgin Interactive wanted Westwood to make a sequel, but it was thought the cost of production would make the game commercially unviable, and the idea was scrapped. For many years, it remained trapped in legal and intellectual property entanglement; preventing a re- release on digital storefronts, until it finally arrived on GOG.com in December 2019. Night Dive Studios and Alcon Entertainment are developing an Enhanced Edition of the game for release on modern computers and consoles for release in 2020. Gameplay Blade Runner is a point-and-click adventure game played from a third-person perspective, in which the game world is navigated, explored, and manipulated using the mouse. The pointer has four different styles depending on the given situation; a standard grey pointer is used to move McCoy by clicking on any location, and scan the screen for elements with which to interact; an animated green pointer indicates McCoy can interact with an object or begin a conversation with an NPC; an animated blue pointer indicates the screen can be changed and a new area accessed (usually appears at the sides of the screen or in doorways); an animated red target becomes available only in combat mode and indicates McCoy can fire (if the target is grey, it means McCoy cannot fire). Blade Runners main focus is detective work rather than puzzles or combat, and the majority of gameplay consists of searching for evidence, questioning suspects and analyzing clues. Occasionally, the player must solve compulsory puzzles, and often, to progress the story, certain clues must be located. Clues are found by searching crime scenes, and come in the form of items, photographs, interviews, or unusual markings. When analyzing photographs, the player must use the ESPER system, a high-density computer with a powerful three-dimensional resolution capacity which allows for the enhancement of photos and enables the player to find details within the picture. Combat is occasionally available in the game, but is rarely compulsory. The only weapon available to the player is McCoy's standard issue police pistol, which may be loaded with various types of ammunition. Another important investigative tool at the player's disposal is the Voight-Kampff machine, which tests people to determine if they are replicants. Usually, Voight-Kampff tests are automatically triggered at certain predetermined points in the game, although on occasion, the player has the option of administering a test. The test depicts a close-up of the subject's eye, and features three needles. The further the top needle moves to the right, the more likely the subject is a replicant; the further the bottom needle moves to the right, the more likely they are human. The third needle is on a sweeping axis and measures the intensity of the questions (for every question the player can choose low, medium or high intensity), and the pressure felt by the subject. If the player pushes the subject too far, by asking too many high intensity questions, the test will end before a definite result can be obtained. If the player determines with certainty whether a subject is or is not a replicant, the test ends automatically. The player must then decide what course of action to take, with the decision influencing the rest of the storyline; for example, if a subject tests positive as a replicant, the player can kill them, attempt to arrest them, or let them go. Which characters are replicants is randomized each time a new game is started. Aside from choosing how to react to Voight-Kampff results, the player must also decide how McCoy conducts himself in other areas of the game, such as whether to interrogate an NPC, or simply talk to them, and how aggressive to be in his questioning. The player can choose from one of five settings regarding McCoy's demeanor during conversations; \\"Polite\\", \\"Normal\\", \\"Surly\\", \\"Erratic\\" (the game randomly picks one of the first three options at different points of the conversation) and \\"User Choice\\". If the fifth option is selected, conversations with NPCs will present the player with menus from which they can choose their questions, rather than the game automatically selecting questions. Each choice will affect the storyline differently, with the player's cumulative decisions leading to one of the game's thirteen different endings. All clues, conversation histories and documents are stored in McCoy's \\"Knowledge Integration Assistant\\" (KIA), where they are automatically organized for easy access. The KIA has three main sections. The \\"Crime Scene Panel\\" lists the various crime scenes, along with all known suspects and all related clues. The \\"Suspect Panel\\" displays all available information about the suspects for the various crimes. It includes a photo of the suspect (if the player has found one), a list of crimes to which they are connected, and a list of clues which tie them to a specific crime. Suspect clues are arranged into four categories; \\"Whereabouts\\" (known places the suspect has visited, and suggestions as to their current location), \\"MO\\" (information on the suspect's previous actions, and suggestions as to their possible future actions), \\"Replicant\\" (any evidence suggesting the suspect may be a replicant) and \\"Non-replicant\\" (any evidence suggesting the suspect may be a human). The \\"Clue Panel\\" is a master list of all clues, but also contains clues which have not been linked to a specific crime or suspect as of yet, and, as such, are not available in either of the other two sections. The KIA also keeps track of McCoy's money and ammunition. The game runs in non-linear \\"real-time\\", meaning that as McCoy investigates and gathers clues, the NPC characters are doing the same, completing their own objectives and performing random actions elsewhere in the game world. A good example of this is found in the computer mainframe, which is accessible from the police headquarters. When the player uploads their KIA data into the mainframe, any evidence collected by other Blade Runners is automatically downloaded into the player's KIA. This tends to be random, with different pieces of evidence discovered by different Blade Runners becoming available at different times of the game. Story=Main characters Ray McCoy is the game's main player character. * Ray McCoy (voiced by Mark Benninghofen): the game's protagonist and a rookie Blade Runner. McCoy shares his apartment with his pet dog, Maggie. * Crystal Steele (Lisa Edelstein): one of the best Blade Runners on the job, and an expert in undercover work. She hates replicants, believing they should be exterminated. She is somewhat condescending towards McCoy early in the game, but grows to respect him as the story progresses. * Gaff (Javier Grajeda as Victor Gardell): a veteran Blade Runner who often offers McCoy advice. * Lt. Edison Guzza (Jeff Garlin): temporarily placed in charge of the Blade Runner unit whilst the previous commander, Cpt. Bryant, is on sick leave. * Clovis (Mark Rolston): the leader of a group of renegade replicants. Highly intelligent and eloquent, he is also extremely ruthless, unpredictable and, at times, capable of extreme acts of aggression. * Lucy Devlin (Pauley Perrette): a fourteen- year-old girl who works at the pet store attacked by the replicants in the opening scene. Supporting characters * Dektora (Signy Coleman): she works as an exotic dancer. * Sadik (Alexander Mervin): part of Clovis' gang. * Howie Lee (Toru Nagai): the owner of a restaurant in Chinatown. * Zuben (Gerald Okamura): a replicant who works as a chef at Howie Lee's Restaurant in Chinatown. * Luther & Lance (Jason Cottle): identical twin replicant brothers who were former Tyrell Corporation employees. * Gordo Frizz (Bruno Oliver): he works as a stand-up comedian. * Runciter (Warren Burton): the owner of the pet store attacked by the game's replicants. * Izo (Timothy Dang): a weapons dealer who supplies automatic firearms to Clovis' gang. * Bullet Bob (Vincent Schiavelli): a World War III veteran who runs a gun shop near Animoid Row. Original cast members from the film who make cameo appearances in the game are Sean Young as Rachael, Brion James as Leon, James Hong as Hannibal Chew, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell, and William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian. Plot McCoy stands at the White Dragon Noodle Bar, the same location where Rick Deckard first appears in the film. The game begins shortly after the beginning of the film, with McCoy tasked with tracking down a group of replicants who are suspected of murdering animals‚Äîa crime nearly as heinous as murdering humans, since most animal species are extinct and real specimens are exceedingly rare. As McCoy's investigation progresses, he is framed for the murder of a civilian by the corrupt Lt. Guzza, who has been assisting the replicants in an effort to prevent them from revealing his activities. Forced into hiding, McCoy explores the underbelly of LA and makes contact with the replicant twins Luther and Lance, former genetic designers for the Tyrell Corporation who are now working to extend their own lifespans as well as those of all other replicants. From them, McCoy receives a detailed report containing evidence of Guzza's corruption. Using this information, he blackmails Guzza and forces him to set his falsified record straight. They meet in the city sewers for the exchange, where Guzza is wounded by replicant gunfire. At this point, the player can either run away or kill Guzza. The game features thirteen different endings, which are influenced by the player's cumulative actions and decisions throughout the story. The endings are variations on three major themes: * McCoy is human and hunts down the replicants either alone or with Crystal. * McCoy is a replicant himself and sides with the other replicants. * McCoy's status remains ambiguous and he sides with neither the replicants nor the police, instead leaving the city‚Äîeither alone, with Dektora or with Lucy. Development=Origins The initial idea for a video game adaptation of Blade Runner came from The Blade Runner Partnership (composed of Bud Yorkin and Jerry Perenchio of Tandem Productions). They originally approached Electronic Arts, Sierra and Activision, before Virgin Interactive agreed to take the project on. However, the rights to the film were spread out over several entities, each of whom owned a different aspect, making production of the game complex from a copyright perspective; The Ladd Company owned North American distribution rights to the film; Run Run Shaw owned international distribution rights; and The Blade Runner Partnership owned all ancillary rights, and were the bond guarantors, who had taken control of the film when it went over-budget and over-schedule towards the end of production. As a result, sorting out the rights took several years before Virgin were in a position to actually begin development. They ultimately hired Westwood Studios to work on the game, but even with the rights secured, and the game in pre-production, there were still legal problems. As Louis Castle, the game's executive producer, art director and technical director, explains However, Castle's unique idea for the game somewhat side-stepped the potential legal problems. He didn't want to adapt the film; he wanted to make an original game set within the film's milieu. This would mean the game would not have to borrow as heavily from the film as it would were it a straight adaptation, hence avoiding the potential legal problems down the road. Virgin loved Castle's idea, and asked him to make a pitch to Bud Yorkin. Castle built a demo for the pitch, but rather than using footage from the film, he and his team created a rough opening cutscene based on the film's aesthetic style, but without recreating any exact scenes. According to Castle, going into the pitch, Yorkin was concerned about how much footage from the film would be needed for the game, but when he saw the demo, he was thrilled, and asked Castle if the whole game could be made in a similar manner. From that point forward, the development team had one overriding mandate; every scene in the game would be generated from scratch in 3D; no footage from the film would be used. Although both footage and the film's soundtrack were off-limits, the designers were allowed to re-create the likenesses of the actors who had appeared in the film. Westwood never intended for Rick Deckard to be a major character in the game, but they did attempt to contact Harrison Ford with the intention of asking him to make a cameo appearance. However, they never received a response. This didn't surprise them, as Ford had had a negative experience working on the film and, at the time, even refused to talk about it in interviews. According to Castle, Ford was also against the concept of video games based on films in general. The designers were also unable to get any input from Ridley Scott, the film's director, as he too had had a bad experience on the film, and had fallen out with Yorkin and Perenchio when they took over production. He was uninterested in participating in the game. Syd Mead was credited as \\"visual futurist\\" on the film, and his concept art was the starting point for the film's aesthetic design. He contributed to the game insofar as he sent the designers samples of his original Blade Runner artwork. One major contributor to the film who did work with the developers, however, was Syd Mead, whose concept art formed the basis for Blade Runners aesthetic. Mead sent the team extracts from his original Blade Runner artwork. However, they quickly noticed a disparity ‚Äì Mead's art didn't correlate with the finished film; whilst his artwork tended to be highly stylized and polished, the film had a much grittier and \\"lived- in\\" texture. The team contacted one of the film's set builders, who explained that had Mead's artwork been used as it was presented, the film would have cost too much, so production designer Lawrence G. Paull and art director David Snyder had decided to create \\"less perfect\\" versions of Mead's designs; they took Mead's concepts and remoulded them. Inspired by this, Castle issued a similar directive to his design team; nothing in the game was to be created from scratch, everything had to come from either the film or Mead's art. Story From the beginning, Westwood had no interest in doing a straight adaptation of the film as either a shoot 'em up or traditional point-and-click adventure game. As a result, the team decided to write a new story set within the fictional milieu of the film ‚Äì a story in which players would play not as Rick Deckard, but as a new character, Ray McCoy. This allowed fans of the film the experience of seeing the sights and sounds of the movie, but without knowing where the story is heading. The writers decided the plot of the game would begin shortly after the opening of the film, with Deckard having already been assigned to track down Roy Batty and the other replicants. The game's plot was imagined in such a way that the player would occasionally hear about Deckard, but would never meet him. For example, when visiting the Tyrell building, Rachael mentions that she has already spoken to another Blade Runner, and Tyrell tells McCoy, \\"as I explained to Mr. Deckard earlier, I've given the Nexus 6 a past.\\" Another example is a photograph taken in Animoid Row, which shows Deckard in the background, and prompts McCoy to exclaim \\"He looks familiar.\\" Additionally, while searching Leon's room in the Yukon hotel, McCoy discovers Det. Holden's badge, and Lt. Guzza questions how Deckard missed it, going on to say, \\"Deckard, he feels too much, ya' know?\\" The developers were also keen to include locations from the film, such as the Bradbury Building, the Tyrell Corporation Pyramid, and the L.A.P.D.'s cylindrical skyscraper. They also enlisted many of the actors from the film to make cameos in the game; Sean Young as Rachael, Brion James as Leon, James Hong as Hannibal Chew, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell, and William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian. Of paramount importance to the designers was that the story of the film be treated as sacrosanct ‚Äì nothing the player can do in the game can ever alter, contradict or in any way run contrary to what happens in the film. David Yorkin, Bud's son, and David Leary worked on the game's script, initially writing it as a linear game. However, the designers wanted the game to feature a great deal of random elements, with the idea being that no two playthroughs would be the same, and no walkthrough would be able to cover every possible eventuality or every possible combination of random events. The game presents the player with fifteen suspects, but only two are always replicants (Clovis and a cook named Zuben). Which of the other thirteen characters is a replicant is randomized every time the player plays the game, and their behavior is different each playthrough based upon whether or not they are human. Due to the random nature of the game, the script swelled to 500 pages, and the quality assurance people had to play through the game 2,500 times to experience every possible variation. Because of how central to the plot randomness is, NPC behavior was not scripted. Instead, each NPC is assigned certain goals to accomplish based upon whether they are a replicant or a human. How they go about accomplishing these goals is handled by the AI system, and can change from game to game, as most of the goals have several possible methods of achievement. The developers likened this aspect of the game to simulation games such as SimCity rather than traditional adventure games such as Myst. Castle explains, \\"those agents are real, goal-oriented artificial intelligences. We don't know what they're going to do, exactly. We've given them behavior, we haven't given them instructions. There's a big difference between behavior-based AI and scripted instructions.\\" Design The game design of Blade Runner was extremely ambitious for the available technology of the time. In contrast to many contemporaneous games, the game engine included pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D characters, but did not require the use of any hardware 3D accelerators. Designers David Leary and James Walls achieved this through a self-developed technology using voxels (pixels with width, height and depth). Castle explains, Louis Castle, co- founder of Westwood Studios, and executive producer, art director and technical director of Blade Runner. The use of voxels, however, meant 3D accelerators couldn't be used, as there would be too many polygons for a card to render. Instead, the designers used a fast rectangular rendering routine that rendered a rectangle whenever it had to draw a polygon. Speaking in 2014, Castle said \\"people ask me all the time \\"Why didn't you just use 3D?\\" Well, that's easy to say now we have full rendering pipelines and shaders, but back then you just didn't. You had a few vertex-shaded polygons and the texel mapping just wasn't accurate on a lot of the cards. Nowadays I'd do it all in 3D.\\" Another reason for not using 3D accelerators was that the game features roughly 140 locations, most of them open to player exploration. Each of these locations featured millions of polygons, well beyond the capabilities of even the most high end graphics cards of the time. The game's environment takes up 60‚Äì65% of the CPU bandwidth, primarily because of the moving camera, but also because eight different characters can appear on screen at any one time ‚Äì a large number for the technology of the time. Because of this, a powerful CPU was required to run the game, since the engine relied on the processor doing all the work in creating the 3D models. However, despite this limitation, the game runs at a minimum of 15 FPS, even on slow systems. The downside to this was that, since processor power at that time was limited, the in-game 3D models tended to look very pixelated, especially up-close and when motionless, due to the low amount of voxels used to display them. However, had the number of voxels been raised to increase the detail on the characters, the game would have become too slow to play, even on advanced CPUs. All character animations in the game are based on motion-captured actors, with the characters moving in the pre-rendered 3D environment. At the time, any game that attempted 1,000 motion-captured sequences was considered cutting edge; Blade Runner featured 20,000. Speaking in 2014, Castle stated Music The rights for the film's original soundtrack could not be secured for the game, so Westwood brought in their in-house composer Frank Klepacki to create new tracks based on Vangelis' score, and also to re-record some of the main tracks from the film. As Klepacki was not allowed access to the original master recordings, he had to re-create the music by ear. Reception Blade Runner received generally positive reviews. It holds an aggregate score of 77% on GameRankings, based on sixteen reviews. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"the game's shortcomings seem irrelevant as the journey that Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford began 15 years ago is brought to an entirely new end at the player's command. All movie- licensed game publishers should take note.\\" Science Fiction Weeklys Peter Suciu awarded it an A+, writing the \\"computer-generated setting of Blade Runner is simply one of the best to arrive on computer desktops,\\" and calling the game \\"an outstandingly enjoyable adventure simulation.\\" Game Revolution's Marke Cooke scored the game an A-, calling it \\"one of the best adventure games out there.\\" RPGFan gave the game an overall rating of 93%, praising its pre- rendered backgrounds, with \\"rain, spotlights, Spinners or blimps advertising off-world vacations. The crisp images never fail to dazzle.\\" Although the review pointed out that the graphics can become a \\"tad blurry and pixilated,\\" it was argued \\"this doesn't detract too much from these otherwise stunning visuals.\\" Quandary's Rosemary Young scored it 3.5 out of 5, pointing out \\"though some aspects of Blade Runner aren't all that sophisticated, it is worth considering for fans of 'hard-edged' crime/science fiction.\\" In a 2006 review for Adventure Gamers, Chris Pickering scored the game 4.5 out of 5, praising it for its \\"glorious aesthetics, intriguing storyline, and well implemented controls.\\" Less impressed was GameSpot's Ron Dulin, who scored the game 6 out of 10, calling it \\"an interesting mood piece, built upon some very detailed graphic work and an interesting premise ‚Äì but somewhere along the production line, someone forgot to include a game.\\" He was critical of the random nature of the game, especially the multiple endings; \\"To justify the number of wildly different endings, the designers have tried to keep some elements of the story very vague for the bulk of the story. But even with these safeguards, there are always a number of confusing contradictions and loose ends no matter how the story winds up.\\" He concluded, \\"most of what's interesting about the game is exactly what was interesting about the film, and not much was done to extend the concepts or explore them any further. Fans of the film will undoubtedly overlook the game's flaws and enjoy living the life of the Blade Runner, even if it only lasts a few hours. But those who are awaiting the next generation of adventure games are advised to keep waiting.\\" In a 2007 article for Computer and Video Games, \\"Blade Runner: A Classic Revisited\\", Duncan Harris argued \\"critics may have been divided over the means by which you got there: a logical trail of clues, many of which were less the result of detective work than blind luck and idle exploration [...] but you couldn't deny that here, for once, was a movie tie-in which put the movie first, dismissing thoughts of its own genre and letting the subject dictate the design. With its insular thinking, it's something the games industry all too rarely sees.\\" Sales and awards Blade Runner was a commercial success. In the United States alone, it sold 15,307 copies and earned $795,045 by November 30, 1997. Between January 1998 and July 1998, it sold another 47,939 copies in the region, which drew $2,283,055 in revenues. Westwood's Louis Castle reported that its lifetime sales had reached 800,000 units worldwide by February 2002. Blade Runners sales ultimately surpassed one million units by 2006; Castle claimed that it outsold The Curse of Monkey Island three to one. Blade Runner won the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' first annual Interactive Achievement Award (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards) in the category \\"Computer Adventure Game of the Year\\"; it was also nominated for \\"Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering\\" and \\"Interactive Title of the Year\\", losing in the first category to Riven and in the second two to GoldenEye 007. In 1998, it was nominated for \\"Adventure Game of the Year\\" by Computer Gaming World and for \\"Best Adventure Game\\" at the PC Gamer awards, losing on both occasions to The Curse of Monkey Island. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Blade Runner the 21st-best adventure game ever released. Sequel and re-release=Sequel Blade Runner sold well, but due to high development costs, the profit margin was low. According to Louis Castle, \\"The mere fact it was four CDs made it a very expensive game. And the deal we had with the Blade Runner Partnership meant it was not terribly profitable. It didn't do as well as you might think.\\" Although Virgin were interested in doing a sequel, if a sequel were approved, the Blade Runner Partnership intended to increase the licensing fee. Ultimately, Westwood and Virgin concluded the cost of producing a game to top the original, coupled with the increased cost for licensing, made the prospect of a sequel economically untenable, as such a sequel would have to sell several million units to generate what would be considered an acceptable profit. In 2009, the Blade Runner Partnership offered Gearbox Software the rights to the franchise, but production costs were estimated at $35 million and the project was scrapped. Re-release Speaking in 2015 regarding a possible re-release of the game via Steam or GOG.com, Louis Castle explained the source code and assets were lost when Westwood moved its studio from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, thus making a re-release or a HD remaster impossible. Even if the code was found, to restore almost a terabyte of assets, whether for new pre-rendered backdrops or full real-time 3D, would cost tens of millions of dollars, making a re-release as unlikely as a sequel. The Blade Runner Partnership and Electronic Arts owned the rights to the game for many years by that point. However, the game finally made it to GOG.com on December 17, 2019 after an agreement with Alcon Interactive Group and the website, using ScummVM as detailed below. ScummVM Several attempts were made to reverse engineer the game's engine. As it is technically complex with voxel graphics for the in-game actors, video backgrounds, and randomised paths, it took the ultimately successful project with combined efforts eight years to completion. The new Blade Runner engine was included in the game engine collection ScummVM on 13 October 2016 and took another three years till it was ready for public testing on 16 June 2019 and was included in ScummVM version 2.1.0. Enhanced Edition Night Dive Studios and Alcon Entertainment announced they would be making an Enhanced Edition of the game for release in 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. Stephen Kick of Night Dive explained that while the source code for the game was lost, they had reverse engineered it and reworked within their proprietary KEX engine they had used for other remastered games. In addition to support for modern systems, the Enhanced Edition will include updated character models, animations and cutscenes.

It belongs to a category of specific phobias, called space and motion discomfort, that share both similar causes and options for treatment. Most people experience a degree of natural fear when exposed to heights, known as the fear of falling. On the other hand, those who have little fear of such exposure are said to have a head for heights. A head for heights is advantageous for those hiking or climbing in mountainous terrain and also in certain jobs such as steeplejacks or wind turbine mechanics. People with acrophobia can experience a panic attack in high places and become too agitated to get themselves down safely. Approximately 2‚Äì5% of the general population has acrophobia, with twice as many women affected as men. The term is from the , √°kron, meaning \\"peak, summit, edge\\" and , ph√≥bos, \\"fear\\".  Confusion with vertigo  \\"Vertigo\\" is often used (incorrectly) to describe a fear of heights, but it is more accurately a spinning sensation that occurs when one is not actually spinning. It can be triggered by looking down from a high place, by looking straight up at a high place or tall object, or even by watching something (i.e. a car or a bird) go past at high speed, but this alone does not describe vertigo. True vertigo can be triggered by almost any type of movement (e.g. standing up, sitting down, walking) or change in visual perspective (e.g. squatting down, walking up or downstairs, looking out of the window of a moving car or train). Vertigo is called height vertigo when the sensation of vertigo is triggered by heights. Height vertigo is caused by a conflict between vision, vestibular and somatosensory senses. This occurs when vestibular and somatosensory systems sense a body movement that is not detected by the eyes. More research indicate that this conflict lead to both motion sickness and anxiety.  Causes  Traditionally, acrophobia has been attributed, like other phobias, to conditioning or a traumatic experience. Recent studies have cast doubt on this explanation. Individuals with acrophobia are found to be lacking in traumatic experiences. Nevertheless, this may be due to the failure to recall the experiences, as memory fades as time passes. To address the problems of self report and memory, a large cohort study with 1000 participants was conducted from birth; the results showed that participants with less fear of heights had more injuries because of falling. More studies have suggested a possible explanation for acrophobia is that it emerges through accumulation of non- traumatic experiences of falling that are not memorable but can influence behaviours in the future. Also, fear of heights may be acquired when infants learn to crawl. If they fell, they would learn the concepts about surfaces, posture, balance, and movement. Cognitive factors may also contribute to the development of acrophobia. People tend to wrongly interpret visuo-vestibular discrepancies as dizziness and nausea and associate them with a forthcoming fall. A traumatic conditional event of falling may not be necessary at this point. A fear of falling, along with a fear of loud noises, is one of the most commonly suggested inborn or \\"non-associative\\" fears. The newer non- association theory is that a fear of heights is an evolved adaptation to a world where falls posed a significant danger. If this fear is inherited, it is possible that people can get rid of it by frequent exposure of heights in habituation. In other words, acrophobia could be attributed to the lack of exposure in early times. The degree of fear varies and the term phobia is reserved for those at the extreme end of the spectrum. Researchers have argued that a fear of heights is an instinct found in many mammals, including domestic animals and humans. Experiments using visual cliffs have shown human infants and toddlers, as well as other animals of various ages, to be reluctant in venturing onto a glass floor with a view of a few meters of apparent fall-space below it. Although human infants initially experienced fear when crawling on the visual cliff, most of them overcame the fear through practice, exposure and mastery and retained a level of healthy cautiousness. While an innate cautiousness around heights is helpful for survival, an extreme fear can interfere with the activities of everyday life, such as standing on a ladder or chair, or even walking up a flight of stairs. Still, it is uncertain if acrophobia is related to the failure to reach a certain developmental stage. Besides associative accounts, a diathetic-stress model is also very appealing for considering both vicarious learning and hereditary factors such as personality traits (i.e., neuroticism). Another possible contributing factor is a dysfunction in maintaining balance. In this case the anxiety is both well founded and secondary. The human balance system integrates proprioceptive, vestibular and nearby visual cues to reckon position and motion. As height increases, visual cues recede and balance becomes poorer even in normal people. However, most people respond by shifting to more reliance on the proprioceptive and vestibular branches of the equilibrium system. Some people are known to be more dependent on visual signals than others. People who rely more on visual cues to control body movements are less physically stable. An acrophobic, however, continues to over-rely on visual signals whether because of inadequate vestibular function or incorrect strategy. Locomotion at a high elevation requires more than normal visual processing. The visual cortex becomes overloaded, resulting in confusion. Some proponents of the alternative view of acrophobia warn that it may be ill-advised to encourage acrophobics to expose themselves to height without first resolving the vestibular issues. Research is underway at several clinics. Recent studies found that participants experienced increased anxiety not only during elevation in height, but also when they were required to move sideways in a fixed height. A recombinant model of the development of acrophobia is very possible, in which learning factors, cognitive factors (e.g. interpretations), perceptual factors(e.g. visual dependence), and biological factors (e.g. heredity) interact to provoke fear or habituation.  Assessment  ICD-10 and DSM-V are used to diagnose acrophobia. Acrophobia Questionnaire (AQ) is a self report that contains 40 items, assessing anxiety level on a 0-6 point scale and degree of avoidance on a 0-2 point scale. The Attitude Towards Heights Questionnaires (ATHQ) and Behavioural Avoidance Tests (BAT) are also used. However, acrophobic individuals tend to have biases in self report. They often overestimate the danger and question their abilities of addressing height relevant issues. A Height Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ) is a self-report to measure these height relevant judgements and interpretations. The Depression Scale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales short form (DASS21-DS) is a self report used to examine validity of the HIQ.  Treatment  Traditional treatment of phobias is still in use today. Its underlying theory states that phobic anxiety is conditioned and triggered by a conditional stimulus. By avoiding phobic situation, anxiety is reduced. However, avoidance behaviour is reinforced through negative reinforcement. Wolpe developed a technique called systematic desensitization to help participants avoid \\"avoidance\\". Research results have suggested that even with a decrease in therapeutic contact densensitization is still very effective. However, other studies have shown that therapists play an essential role in acrophobia treatment. Treatments like reinforced practice and self-efficacy treatments also emerged. There have been a number of studies into using virtual reality therapy for acrophobia. Botella and colleagues and Schneider were the first to use VR in treatment. Specifically, Schneider utilised inverted lenses in binoculars to \\"alter\\" the reality. Later in mid 1990s, VR became computer based and was widely available for therapists. A cheap VR equipment uses a normal PC with head-mounted display (HMD). In contrast, VRET uses an advanced computer automatic virtual environment (CAVE). VR has several advantages over in vivo treatment: (1) therapist can control the situation better by manipulating the stimuli, in terms of their quality, intensity, duration and frequency; (2) VR can help participants avoid public embarrassment and protect their confidentiality; (3) therapist's office can be well maintained; (4) VR encourages more people to seek treatment; (5) VR saves time and money as participants do not need to leave the consulting room. Many different types of medications are used in the treatment of phobias like fear of heights, including traditional anti-anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepines, and newer options like antidepressants and beta-blockers.  Prognosis  Some desensitization treatments produce short-term improvements in symptoms. Long- term treatment success has been elusive.  Epidemiology  True acrophobia is uncommon. A related, milder form of visually triggered fear or anxiety is called visual height intolerance(vHI). Up to one-third of people may have some level of visual height intolerance. Pure vHI usually has smaller impact on individuals compared to acrophobia, in terms of intensity of syptoms load, social life, and overall life quality. However, only few people with visual height intolerance seek for professional help.  Society and culture  In the Alfred Hitchcock film Vertigo, John \\"Scottie\\" Ferguson, played by James Stewart, has to resign from the police force after an incident which causes him to develop both acrophobia and vertigo. The word \\"vertigo\\" is only mentioned once, while \\"acrophobia\\" is mentioned several times. Early on in the film, Ferguson faints while climbing a step-ladder. There are numerous references throughout the film to fear of heights and falling.

It is a treatable phobia that both humans and animals can develop. The term astraphobia is composed of the Greek words ·ºÄœÉœÑœÅŒ±œÄŒÆ (astrape; lightning) and œÜœåŒ≤ŒøœÇ (phobos; fear). Signs and symptoms A person with astraphobia will often feel anxious during a thunderstorm even when they understand that the threat to them is minimal. Some symptoms are those accompanied with many phobias, such as trembling, crying, sweating, panicked reactions, the sudden feeling of using the bathroom, nausea, the feeling of dread, insertion of the fingers in the ears, and rapid heartbeat. However, there are some reactions that are unique to astraphobia. For instance, reassurance from other people is usually sought, and symptoms worsen when alone. Many people who have astraphobia will look for extra shelter from the storm.Johnson, Trevor \\"Fear of Thunder - Dealing With Astraphobia.\\" Fear of Thunder- Dealing with Astraphobia. 30 Jan. 2009. EzineArticles.com. 14 Oct 2009 They might hide underneath a bed, under the covers, in a closet, in a basement, or any other space where they feel safer. Efforts are usually made to smother the sound of the thunder; the person may cover their ears or curtain the windows. A typical sign that someone has astraphobia is a very heightened interest in weather forecasts. An astraphobic person will be alert for news of incoming storms. They may watch the weather on television constantly during rainy bouts and may even track thunderstorms online. This can become severe enough that the person may not go outside without checking the weather first. This can lead to anxiety. In very extreme cases, astraphobia can lead to agoraphobia, the fear of leaving the home. Children In 2007 scientists found astraphobia is the third most prevalent phobia in the US. It can occur in people of any age. It occurs in many children, and should not be immediately identified as a phobia because children naturally go through many fears as they mature. Their fear of thunder and lightning cannot be considered a fully developed phobia unless it persists for more than six months. In this case, the child's phobia should be addressed, for it may become a serious problem in adulthood. To lessen a child's fear during thunderstorms, the child can be distracted by games and activities. A bolder approach is to treat the storm as an entertainment; a fearless adult is an excellent role model for children. Treatment The most widely used and possibly the most effective treatment for astraphobia is exposure to thunderstorms and eventually building an immunity. Some other treatment methods include Cognitive behavioral therapy Fritscher, Lisa Astraphobia - Fear of Thunder and Lightning. 30 Apr. 2011. About.com. Retrieved on 30 June 2014. (CBT) and Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). The patient will in many cases be instructed to repeat phrases to himself or herself in order to become calm during a storm. Heavy breathing exercises can reinforce this effort. Dogs and cats Dogs may exhibit severe anxiety during thunderstorms; between 15 and 30 percent may be affected. Research confirms high levels of cortisol - a hormone associated with stress - affects dogs during and after thunderstorms. Remedies include behavioral therapies such as counter conditioning and desensitization, anti-anxiety medications, and dog appeasing pheromone, a synthetic analogue of a hormone secreted by nursing canine mothers. Studies have also shown that cats can be afraid of thunderstorms. Whilst it is less common, cats have been known to hide under a table or behind a couch during a thunderstorm. Generally if any animal is anxious during a thunderstorm or any similar, practically harmless event (e.g. fireworks display), it is advised to simply continue behaving normally, instead of attempting to comfort animals. Showing fearlessness is, arguably, the best method to \\"cure\\" the anxiety.

Roman copy of the Athenian version by Kritios and Nesiotes (see below) Harmodius (Greek: ·ºâœÅŒºœåŒ¥ŒπŒøœÇ, Harm√≥dios) and Aristogeiton (·ºàœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøŒ≥ŒµŒØœÑœâŒΩ, Aristoge√≠ton; both died 514 BC) were two ancient Athenian lovers that became known as the Tyrannicides (œÑœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩŒΩœåŒ∫œÑŒøŒΩŒøŒπ, tyrannoktonoi), the preeminent symbol of democracy to ancient Athenians, after they committed an act of political assassination at the 514 BC Panathenaic Festival. They assassinated Hipparchus, thought to be the last Peisistratid tyrant, though according to Thucydides Hipparchus was not a tyrant but a minister. They also planned to kill the real tyrant of Athens, Hippias, but were unsuccessful. Background The two principal historical sources covering Harmodius and Aristogeiton are the History of the Peloponnesian War (VI, 56‚Äì59) by Thucydides, and The Constitution of the Athenians (XVIII) attributed to Aristotle or his school. However, their story is documented by a great many other ancient writers, including important sources such as Herodotus and Plutarch. Herodotus claimed that Harmodius and Aristogeiton presumably were \\"Gephyraeans\\" (el) i.e. Boeotians of Syrian or Phoenician origin. Plutarch, in his book On the malice of Herodotus criticized Herodotus for prejudice and misrepresentation and he argued that Harmodius and Aristogeiton were Euboeans or Eretrians. Peisistratus had become tyrant of Athens after his third attempt in 546/7 BC. In Archaic Greece, the term tyrant did not connote malevolence. A tyrant was simply one who had seized power and ruled outside of a state's constitutional law. When Peisistratus died in 528/7 BC, his son Hippias took the position of Archon and became the new tyrant of Athens, with the help of his brother, Hipparchus, who acted as the minister of culture. The two continued their father's policies, but their popularity declined after Hipparchus began to abuse the power of his position. Thucydides offers this explanation for Harmodios and Aristogeiton's actions in Book VI: Hipparchus was rejected by Harmodius, for whom he had unrequited feelings. Hipparchus invited Harmodius' young sister to be the kanephoros (to carry the ceremonial offering basket) at the Panathenaea festival, then publicly chased her away on the pretext she was not a virgin, as required. This publicly shamed Harmodius' family. With his lover Aristogeiton, Harmodius resolved to assassinate both Hippias and Hipparchus and thus to overthrow the tyranny. Harmodios and Aristogeiton successfully killed Hipparchus during the 514 BC Panathenaia, but Hippias survived and remained in power. In the four years between Hipparchus' assassination and the deposition of the Pisistratids, Hippias became an increasingly oppressive tyrant. According to Aristotle, it was Thessalos, the hot-headed son of Peisistratus' Argive concubine, and thus half-brother to Hipparchus, who was the one to court Harmodius and drive off his sister. The assassination Death of the tyrant Hipparchus, by the Syriskos Painter, 475‚Äì470 BC The plot ‚Äì to be carried out by means of daggers hidden in the ceremonial myrtle wreaths on the occasion of the Panathenaic Games ‚Äì involved a number of other co-conspirators. Thucydides claims that this day was chosen because during the Panathenaic festival, it was customary for the citizens taking part in the procession to go armed, while carrying weapons on any other day would have been suspicious. Aristotle disagrees, asserting that the custom of bearing weapons was introduced later, by the democracy. Seeing one of the co-conspirators greet Hippias in a friendly manner on the assigned day, the two thought themselves betrayed and rushed into action, ruining the carefully laid plans. They managed to kill Hipparchus, stabbing him to death as he was organizing the Panathenaean processions at the foot of the Acropolis. Herodotus expresses surprise at this event, asserting that Hipparchus had received a clear warning concerning his fate in a dream. Harmodius was killed on the spot by spearmen of Hipparchus' guards, while Aristogeiton was arrested shortly thereafter. Upon being told of the event, Hippias, feigning calm, ordered the marching Greeks to lay down their ceremonial weapons and to gather at an indicated spot. All those with concealed weapons or under suspicion were arrested, gaining Hippias a respite from the uprising. Thucydides' identification of Hippias as the two's purported main target, rather than Hipparchus who was Aristogeiton's rival erastes, has been suggested as a possible indication of bias on his part. Aristogeiton's torture Aristotle in the Constitution of Athens preserves a tradition that Aristogeiton died only after being tortured in the hope that he would reveal the names of the other conspirators. During his ordeal, personally overseen by Hippias, he feigned willingness to betray his co- conspirators, claiming only Hippias' handshake as guarantee of safety. Upon receiving the tyrant's hand he is reputed to have berated him for shaking the hand of his own brother's murderer, upon which the tyrant wheeled and struck him down on the spot. Le√¶na Likewise, there is a later tradition that Aristogeiton (or Harmodius)Alciato, Emblemata; EMBLEMA XIII Cecropia effictam quam cernis in arce Leaenam, Harmodii (an nescis hospes?) amica fuit.

One version of her story holds that previous to being tortured she had bitten off her tongue, afraid that her resolve would break from the pain of the torture. Another is that the Athenians, unwilling to honour a courtesan, placed a statue of a lioness without a tongue in the vestibule of the Acropolis simply to honor her fortitude in maintaining silence. The statue was made by the sculptor Amphicrates. It was also in her honor that Athenian statues of Aphrodite were from then on accompanied by stone lionesses [after Pausanias]. Le√¶na's story is only told in later antiquity sources and is likely spurious.Kapparis (2018), pp. 100‚Äì101. \\"This story is a revision of the traditional tale in order to explain the bronze lioness with the missing tongue, and probably also to gloss over the uncomfortable feeling of later antiquity audiences over the homosexual relationship of those two most glorious heroes from the Athenian past.\\" Aftermath His brother's murder led Hippias to establish an even stricter dictatorship, which proved very unpopular and was overthrown, with the help of an army from Sparta, in 508. This was followed by the reforms of Cleisthenes, who established a democracy in Athens. Apotheosis Subsequent history came to identify the figures of Harmodius and Aristogeiton as martyrs to the cause of Athenian freedom, possibly for political and class reasons, and they became known as \\"the Liberators\\" (eleutherioi) and \\"the Tyrannicides\\" (tyrannophonoi). According to later writers, descendants of Harmodius and Aristogeiton's families were given hereditary privileges, such as sitesis (the right to take meals at public expense in the town hall), ateleia (exemption from certain religious duties), and proedria (front-row seats in the theater). A number of years after the event, it had become a received tradition among the Athenians to believe that Hipparchus was the elder of the brothers, and to fashion him as the tyrant. Statues and artistic depictions After the establishment of democracy, Cleisthenes commissioned the sculptor Antenor to produce a bronzeLucian refers to this \\"œáŒ±ŒªŒ∫Œø·ø¶œÇ\\" (of copper) statue in Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±œÉŒØœÑŒøœÖ, 48. statue group of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. It was the first commission of its kind, and the very first statue to be paid for out of public funds, as the two were the first Greeks considered by their countrymen worthy of having statues raised to them. According to Pliny the Elder, it was erected in the Kerameikos in 509, as part of a cenotaph of the heroes. However, a far more probable location is in the Agora at Athens, and many later authors such as Pausanius and Timaeus attest to this. Annual offerings (enagismata) were presented there by the polemarch, the Athenian minister of war. There it stood alone as special laws prohibited the erection of any other statues in their vicinity. Upon its base was inscribed a verse by the poet Simonides: The statue was taken as war booty in 480 BC by Xerxes I during the early Greco-Persian Wars and installed by him at Susa. As soon as the Greeks vanquished the Persians at Salamis, a new statue was commissioned. It was sculpted this time by Kritios and Nesiotes, and set up in 477/476 BC.Marm. Par. Ep. 54.70; Pausanias, 1.8.5 It is the one which served as template for the group we possess today, which was found in the ruins of Hadrian's villa and is now in Naples. According to Arrian,Arrian De Exp. Alex. III.xiv when Alexander the Great conquered the Persian empire, in 330, he discovered the statue at Susa and had it shipped back to Athens. When the statue, on its journey back, arrived at Rhodes it was given divine honors.Valerius Maximus, II.x Several comments of the ancients regarding the statue have come down to us. When asked, in the presence of Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, which type of bronze was the best, Antiphon the Sophist replied, Lycurgus, in his oration against Leocrates, asserts that, Other sculptors made statues of the heroes, such as Praxiteles, who made two, also of bronze. The statue group has been seen, in modern times, as an invitation to identify erotically and politically with the figures, and to become oneself a tyrannicide. According to Andrew Stewart, the statue The configuration of the group is duplicated on a painted vase, a Panathenaic amphora from 400,British Museum: London B 605. Beazley, Attic Black-figure Vases, 411.4. and on a bas-relief on the Elgin throne, dated to ca. 300. Skolia Another tribute to the two heroes was a hymn (skolion) praising them for restoring isonomia (equal distribution of justice) to the Athenians. The skolion may be referred to 500 BC or thereabouts, and is ascribed to Callistratus, an Athenian poet known only for this work. It is preserved by Athenaeus. Its popularity was such that When sung, the singer would hold a branch of myrtle in his hand. This ode has been translated by many modern poets such as Edgar Allan Poe, who composed his Hymn to Aristogeiton and Harmodius in 1827.glbtq: Harmodius and Aristogeiton The following translation was judged to be the best and most faithful of a number of versions attempted in Victorian England. > In myrtles veil'd will I the falchion wear, For thus the patriot sword > Harmodius and Aristogiton bare, When they the tyrant's bosom gored, And bade > the men of Athens be Regenerate in equality. Oh! beloved Harmodius! never > Shall death be thine, who liv'st for ever. Thy shade, as men have told, > inherits The islands of the blessed spirits, Where deathless live the > glorious dead, Achilles fleet of foot, and Diomed. In myrtles veil'd will I > the falchion wear, For thus the patriot sword Harmodius and Aristogiton > bare, When they the tyrant's bosom gored; When in Minerva's festal rite They > closed Hipparchus' eyes in night. Harmodius' praise, Aristogiton's name, > Shall bloom on earth with undecaying fame; Who with the myrtle-wreathed > sword The tyrant's bosom gored, And bade the men of Athens be Regenerate in > equality. Importance to the erastes-eromenos tradition The story of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and its treatment by later Greek writers, is illustrative of attitudes to pederasty in ancient Greece. Both Thucydides and Herodotus describe the two as lovers, their love affair was styled as moderate (sophron) and legitimate (dikaios).Nick Fisher, Aeschines (2001). Against Timarchos. p. 27; Oxford University Press; Further confirming the status of the two as paragons of pederastic ethics, a domain forbidden to slaves, a law was passed prohibiting slaves from being named after the two heroes.Aul. Gel. 9.2.10; Lib. Decl. 1.1.71 The story continued to be cited as an admirable example of heroism and devotion for many years. In 346 BC, for example, the politician Timarchus was prosecuted (for political reasons) on the grounds that he had prostituted himself as a youth. The orator who defended him, Demosthenes, cited Harmodius and Aristogeiton, as well as Achilles and Patroclus, as examples of the beneficial effects of same-sex relationships.Cf. Aeschines, trans. Charles Darwin Adams, (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd., 1919), [132] & [133] Aeschines offers them as an example of dikaios er≈çs, \\"just love\\", and as proof of the boons such love brings the lovers ‚Äì who were both improved by love beyond all praise ‚Äì as well as to the city.Victoria Wohl, Love among the Ruins: The Erotics of Democracy in Classical Athens p. 5 See also *Harmodius and Aristogeiton (sculpture) *Athenian democracy *Leaena NotesReferences ;Ancient histories    * ;Other  * Fabbro, Helena (1995).

They are commonly used in small-configured computer systems. Originally, they were a niche product, designed for fan-less cooling with a low power consumption architecture, which made them useful for home theater PC systems, where fan noise can detract from the cinema experience. The four mounting holes in a Mini-ITX board line up with four of the holes in ATX-specification motherboards, and the locations of the backplate and expansion slot are the same (though one of the holes used was optional in earlier versions of the ATX spec). Mini-ITX boards can therefore often be used in cases designed for ATX, micro-ATX and other ATX variants if desired. The design provides one expansion slot. Earlier motherboards conventionally have a standard 33 MHz 5V 32-bit PCI slot. Many older case designs use riser cards and some even have two-slot riser cards, although the two-slot riser cards are not compatible with all boards. Some boards based around non-x86 processors have a 3.3V PCI slot, and the Mini-ITX 2.0 (2008) boards have a PCI-Express √ó16 slot; these boards are not compatible with the standard PCI riser cards supplied with older ITX (Information Technology eXtended) cases. History A VIA EPIA-M910 mini-ITX motherboard In March 2001, the chipset manufacturer VIA Technologies released a reference design for an ITX motherboard, to promote the low power C3 processor they had bought from Centaur Technology, in combination with their chipsets. Designed by Robert Kuo, VIA's chief R&D; expert, the 215√ó191 mm VT6009 ITX Reference Board was demonstrated in \\"Information PC\\" and set-top box configurations. He later designed the Mini- ITX specification. At that point, few manufacturers took up the ITX design, but Shuttle, Jetway, etc. produced many ITX based cube computers. Other manufactures instead produced smaller boards based on the very similar 229√ó191 mm FlexATX configuration. In October 2001, VIA announced their decision to create a new motherboard division, to provide standardized infrastructure for lower-cost PC iterations, and focus on embedded devices. The result was the November 2001 release of the VT6010 Mini-ITX reference design, once again touted as an \\"Information PC\\", or low cost entry level x86 computing platform. Manufacturers were still reluctant, but customer response was much more receptive, so VIA decided to manufacture and sell the boards themselves. In April 2002 the first Mini-ITX motherboards‚ÄîVIA's EPIA 5000 (fanless 533 MHz Eden processor) and EPIA 800 (800 MHz C3)‚Äîwere sold to industrial customers. Enthusiasts soon noticed the advantages of small size, low noise and power consumption, and started to push the boundaries of case modding into something else‚Äîbuilding computers into nearly every object imaginable, and sometimes even creating new cases altogether. Hollowed out vintage computers, humidors, toys, electronics, musical instruments, and even a 1960s-era toaster have become homes to relatively quiet, or even silent Mini-ITX systems, capable of many of the tasks of a modern desktop PC. Mini-ITX boards primarily appeal to the industrial and embedded PC markets, with the majority sold as bulk components or integrated into a finished system for single-purpose computing applications. They are produced with a much longer sales life-cycle than consumer boards (some of the original EPIAs are still available), a quality that industrial users typically require. Manufacturers can prototype using standard cases and power supplies, then build their own enclosures if volumes get high enough. Typical applications include playing music in supermarkets, powering self-service kiosks, and driving content on digital displays. VIA continues to expand its Mini-ITX motherboard line. Some earlier generations included the original PL133 chipset boards (dubbed the \\"Classic\\" boards), CLE266 chipset boards (adding MPEG-2 acceleration), and CN400 boards (which added MPEG-4 acceleration). Second generation boards featured the EPIA M, MII, CL, PD, TC and MS ‚Äî all tailored to slightly different markets. Legacy VIA boards use their x86-compatible CPUs ‚Äî the C3, C7 or low-power Eden variants, with newer boards featuring the VIA Nano CPU, launched in May 2008.. Other manufacturers have also produced boards designed around the same layout, using VIA, but also Intel, AMD, Transmeta and PowerPC technology. Intel introduced a line of Mini-ITX boards for the Atom CPU, which demonstrates a significant increase in processing performance (but without added power consumption) over older VIA C3 and C7 offerings and helps make the design viable for personal computers. Other manufacturers saw the potential of the design, and followed suit, some even not limiting themselves to the Atom, as evidenced by Zotac GeForce 9300-ITX board. that supports Core 2 Duo CPUs with FSB frequencies up to 1333 MHz, two separate-channeled 800 MHz memory slots and fully functional PCI Express 2.0 x16 slot that could connect through SLI to the onboard video.. This new wave of offerings made Mini-ITX much more popular among home users, hobbyists, and even overclockers. Intel is currently one of few Mini-ITX mainboard manufacturers that list mechanical dimensions in their manuals.. Intel-based products=Onboard CPU Intel D945GCLF2D Atom 330 Mini-ITX motherboard A number of manufacturers have released Mini-ITX motherboards that feature embedded CPUs, often mobile or low-TDP versions. These processors are designed to draw minimal power resulting in lower TDP ideal for fanless (passively cooled) configurations and embedded applications.. Socketed CPU left Starting from LGA 775, socketed Intel Mini-ITX motherboards have been released by Intel and Zotac. This was followed by LGA 1156 motherboards Starting from LGA 1155, Mini-ITX motherboards have started to become mainstream, with many different manufacturers releasing products. This is partly because almost all Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge Intel Celeron, Pentium and Core series CPUs have integrated processor graphics, eliminating the need for motherboard graphics or discrete graphics cards.. This trend continues with LGA 1150, LGA 1151, and LGA 1200 CPUs. Due to the limitations of the Mini-ITX design, and the physical size of the LGA 2011 socket, Mini-ITX motherboards with the socket only support a single PCI Express expansion slot, and they require using the narrow-ILM version of the LGA 2011 socket. Despite this, manufacturers have released LGA 2011 based Mini-ITX motherboards. Also, Mini-ITX motherboards with the LGA 2066 socket have been released, with four SODIMM slots. AMD-based products A number of manufacturers have released several socketed AMD Mini-ITX motherboards, supporting Socket AM2,. Socket AM2+, Socket AM3, Socket FM1, Socket FM2, Socket FM2+, Socket AM1 and Socket AM4 CPUs. Socket AM2+ and AM3 ITX motherboards have integrated motherboard graphics, while discrete graphics or processor integrated graphics are required for other platforms. Mini-ITX motherboards with integrated AMD CPUs are also released. These motherboards often use mobile CPUs and passive cooling, and feature more powerful integrated graphics compared to their Intel counterparts, which makes them suitable for HTPC. Transmeta-based products IBASE made the first Transmeta-based Mini-ITX motherboard, the MB860. The board uses Transmeta Efficeon processors that run at up to 1.2 GHz. It supports SODIMM DDR modules with capacities up to 1 GB. An onboard 16 MB ATI M7 graphics controller supports 3D games and graphical intensive programs. It provides four USB 2.0 ports, a Realtek 8100C 10/100Mbit/s BaseT Ethernet and an optional 8110S Gigabit Ethernet controller. PowerPC-based products The first PowerPC motherboards were produced by Eyetech. in 2005. but they stopped any activity in 2005.Eyetech So company ACube Systems made a new board, the Sam440ep, primarily for the AmigaOS market. ARM-based products Marvell and SolidRunMACCHIATObin product page, SolidRun. Cadia Networks developed a Mini ITX ARM board, which comes with an ARM Cortex-A8 Freescale i.MX53 series CPU. According to the official website, the board \\"offers an ultra-low power SoC with a variety of I/O and OS support for Android / Linux2.6 / Windows Embedded Compact 7\\". Kontron also developed a mini ITX ARM board. According to the website, it features an \\"ARM Cortex-A9 Quad Core 900MHz Processor with NEON Technology\\", an Nvidia graphics processor, 2 GB of RAM, and a targeted power consumption of < 7W for the entire board. AppliedMicro offers the XC-1 Server Development Platform motherboard, which uses the X-Gene ARMv8 system on a chip with 8 2.4 GHz CPU cores, supports 128 GB DDR3 DRAM using 16 GB DIMMs, and has a baseboard management controller. Power SoC mainboard with ATX12V connector installed in a Micro-ATX computer case. The Mini-ITX standard does not define a standard for the computer power supply, though it suggests possible options. Conventionally Mini-ITX boards use a 20- or 24-pin \\"original ATX\\" power connector. This is usually connected to a DC-DC converter board, which connects to an external power adapter. Generally, vendors provide both power adapter and DC-DC board with the case. Some boards have built in DC-DC converters and converters have also been made to plug directly into the ATX connector (e.g. the PicoPSU), either of these options avoids the need to mount a separate DC-DC converter into the case, saving space and design effort. Boards using full-power Intel or AMD CPUs typically use ATX12V 2.x connections and require a case with appropriate power supply and cooling for these more power-hungry chips. Defined by the ATX specification, power supplies with ATX12V connector on a separate 12 volts rail must not idle that 12 volts rail.

Sophisticated Rococo Niderviller faience, by a French factory that also made porcelain, 1760-65 Faience or fa√Øence (; ) is the conventional name in English for fine tin-glazed pottery, at least when there is no more usual English name for the type concerned. The invention of a white pottery glaze suitable for painted decoration, by the addition of an oxide of tin to the slip of a lead glaze, was a major advance in the history of pottery. The invention seems to have been made in Iran or the Middle East before the ninth century. A kiln capable of producing temperatures exceeding was required to achieve this result, the result of millennia of refined pottery-making traditions. The term is now used for a wide variety of pottery from several parts of the world, including many types of European painted wares, often produced as cheaper versions of porcelain styles. English generally uses various other terms for well-known sub-types of faience. Italian tin-glazed earthenware, at least the early forms, is called maiolica in English, Dutch wares are called Delftware, and their English equivalents English delftware, leaving \\"faience\\" as the normal term in English for French, German, Spanish, Portuguese wares and those of other countries not mentioned (it is also the usual French term, and fayence in German). The name faience is simply the French name for Faenza, in the Romagna near Ravenna, Italy, where a painted majolica ware on a clean, opaque pure-white ground, was produced for export as early as the fifteenth century. Hispano-Moresque ware dish from Manises, 15th century, the earliest type of European faience. Technically, lead-glazed earthenware, such as the French sixteenth-century Saint-Porchaire ware, does not properly qualify as faience, but the distinction is not usually maintained. Semi-vitreous stoneware may be glazed like faience. Egyptian faience is not really faience, or pottery, at all, but made of a vitreous frit, and so closer to glass. In English 19th-century usage \\"faience\\" was often used to describe \\"any earthenware with relief modelling decorated with coloured glazes\\",Petrie, Kevin; Livingstone, Andrew, eds., The Ceramics Reader, p. 98, 2017, Bloomsbury Publishing, , 9781472584434, google books including much glazed architectural terracotta and Victorian majolica, adding a further complexity to the list of meanings of the term.  History of faience pottery =Western Mediterranean The Moors brought the technique of tin-glazed earthenware to Al-Andalus, where the art of lustreware with metallic glazes was perfected. From at least the 14th century, M√°laga in Andalusia and later Valencia exported these \\"Hispano-Moresque wares\\", either directly or via the Balearic Islands to Italy and the rest of Europe. Later these industries continued under Christian lords. \\"Majolica\\" and \\"maiolica\\" are garbled versions of \\"Maiorica\\",\\"the larger one\\" in Medieval Latin and Italian, as opposed to Menorca, \\"the smaller one\\" of the Balearic Islands the island of Majorca, which was a transshipping point for refined tin-glazed earthenwares shipped to Italy from the kingdom of Aragon in Spain at the close of the Middle Ages. This type of Spanish pottery owed much to its Moorish inheritance. In Italy, locally produced tin-glazed earthenwares, now called maiolica, initiated in the fourteenth century, reached a peak in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. After about 1600, these lost their appeal to elite customers, and the quality of painting declined, with geometric designs and simple shapes replacing the complicated and sophisticated scenes of the best period. Production continues to the present day in many centres, and the wares are again called \\"faience\\" in English (though usually still maiolica in Italian). At some point \\"faience\\" as a term for pottery from Faenza in northern Italy was a general term used in French, and then reached English.Alan Caiger-Smith, 1973. Tin-Glazed Pottery (London: Faber and Faber). French and northern European fa√Øence Rococo tureen, Marseille, ca 1770 The first northerners to imitate the tin-glazed earthenwares being imported from Italy were the Dutch. Delftware is a kind of faience, made at potteries round Delft in the Netherlands, characteristically decorated in blue on white. It began in the early sixteenth century on a relatively small scale, imitating Italian maiolica, but from around 1580 it began to imitate the highly sought-after blue and white Chinese export porcelain that was beginning to reach Europe, soon followed by Japanese export porcelain. From the later half of the century the Dutch were manufacturing and exporting very large quantities, some in its own recognisably Dutch style, as well as copying East Asian porcelain. In France, the first well-known painter of fa√Øence was Masseot Abaquesne, established in Rouen in the 1530s. Nevers faience and Rouen faience were the leading French centres of faience manufacturing in the 17th century, both able to supply wares to the standards required by the court and nobility. Nevers continued the Italian istoriato maiolica style, painted with figurative subjects, until around 1650. Many others centres developed from the early 18th century, led in 1690 by Quimper in Brittany , followed by Moustiers, Marseille, Strasbourg and Lun√©ville and many smaller centres. The cluster of factories in the south were generally the most innovative, while Strasbourg and other centres near the Rhine were much influenced by German porcelain. The products of faience manufactories are identified by the usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: the character of the clay body, the character and palette of the glaze, and the style of decoration, fa√Øence blanche being left in its undecorated fired white slip. Fa√Øence parlante (especially from Nevers) bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. Apothecary wares, including albarelli, can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the fa√Øence patriotique that was a specialty of the years of the French Revolution. \\"English delftware\\" produced in Lambeth, London, and at other centres, from the late sixteenth century, provided apothecaries with jars for wet and dry drugs, among a wide range of wares. Large painted dishes were produced for weddings and other special occasions, with crude decoration that later appealed to collectors of English folk art. Many of the early potters in London were Flemish.(Royal Pharmaceutical Society) \\"English Delftware Storage Jars\\" By about 1600, blue- and-white wares were being produced, labelling the contents within decorative borders. The production was slowly superseded in the first half of the eighteenth century with the introduction of cheap creamware. Luneville Faience Dutch potters in northern (and Protestant) Germany established German centres of faience: the first manufactories in Germany were opened at Hanau (1661) and Heusenstamm (1662), soon moved to nearby Frankfurt-am-Main. In Switzerland, Zunfthaus zur Meisen near Fraum√ºnster church houses the porcelain and faience collection of the Swiss National Museum in Zurich. By the mid-18th centuries many French factories produced (as well as simpler wares) pieces that followed the Rococo styles of the French porcelain factories and often hired and trained painters with the skill to produce work of a quality that sometimes approached them. The products of French faience manufactories, rarely marked, are identified by the usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: the character of the body, the character and palette of the glaze, and the style of decoration, fa√Øence blanche being left in its undecorated fired white slip. Fa√Øence parlante bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. Wares for apothecaries, including albarello, can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the Fa√Øence patriotique that was a specialty of the years of the French Revolution. By the mid-18th century, glazed earthenware made in Liguria was imitating decors of its Dutch and French rivals In the course of the later 18th century, cheaper porcelain, and the refined earthenwares first developed in Staffordshire pottery such as creamware took over the market for refined faience. The French industry was given a nearly fatal blow by a commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1786, much lobbied for by Josiah Wedgwood, which set the import duty on English earthenware at a nominal level.Coutts, Howard, The Art of Ceramics: European Ceramic Design, 1500-1830, p. 220, 2001, Yale University Press, , 9780300083873, google books In the early 19th century, fine stoneware‚Äîfired so hot that the unglazed body vitrifies‚Äîclosed the last of the traditional makers' ateliers even for beer steins. At the low end of the market, local manufactories continued to supply regional markets with coarse and simple wares, and many local varieties have continued to be made in versions of the old styles as a form of folk art, and today for tourists. Revival In the 19th century two glazing techniques revived by Minton were: 1. Tin-glazed pottery in the style of Renaissance Italian maiolica and, 2. The pottery of coloured glazes decoration over unglazed earthenware molded in low relief.

The Walters Art Museum. The term faience broadly encompassed finely glazed ceramic beads, figures and other small objects found in Egypt as early as 4000 BC, as well as in the Ancient Near East, the Indus Valley Civilisation and Europe. However, this material is not pottery at all, containing no clay, but a vitreous frit, either self-glazing or glazed.

She is also known as Savitri and Vedamata (mother of vedas). Gayatri is often associated with Savitr, a solar deity in the vedas.Constance Jones, James D. Ryan (2005), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Infobase Publishing, p.167, entry \\"Gayatri Mantra\\"Roshen Dalal (2010), The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths, Penguin Books India, p.328, entry \\"Savitr, god\\" According to many texts like Skanda Purana, Gayatri is the another name of Saraswati or her form and is the consort of Lord Brahma. However, Saivite texts identify Mahagayatri as the consort of Shiva, in his highest form of Sadasiva with five heads and ten hands  Development  Gayatri was the name initially applied to a metre of the Rig Veda consisting of 24 syllables. In particular, it refers to the Gayatri Mantra and the Goddess GƒÅyatrƒ´ as that mantra personified. The Gayatri mantra composed in this triplet form is the most famous. Most of the scholars identify Gayatri as the feminine form of Gayatra, another name of the Vedic Solar god which is also one of the synonyms of Savitri and Savitr. However, the transition period in which the mantra began to assume personification as a deity is still unknown. According to the puranas Gayatri was a Gujjar(cow shepherd) girl who helped Brahma in a Yajna performed in Pushkar . There are different sources available to construct her development through ages. Description of Gayatri In Mahanarayana Upanishad. of Krishna Yajurveda, Gayatri is described as white-colored (Sanskrit: ', '), having the gotra of sage viswamitra (Sanskrit: ', ') , composed of 24 letters (Sanskrit: ', '), three-footed (Sanskrit: ', '), six-bellied (Sanskrit: ', '), five-headed (Sanskrit: ', ') and the one used in Upanayana of dvijas (Sanskrit: ', '). As mentioned in Taittiriya Sandhya Bhashyam, the three feet of Gayatri is supposed to represent the first 3 vedas (·πök, Yajus, SƒÅma). The six bellies are supposed to represent 4 cardinal directions, along with the two more directions, ≈™rdhva (Zenith) and Adhara (Nadir). The five heads represent 5 among the Vedangas, namely, vyƒÅkara·πáa, ≈õik·π£ƒÅ, kalpa, nirukta and jyoti·π£a.Taittirƒ´ya SandhyƒÅ BhƒÅ·π£yam, p.83, Sri Krishna Pandita, Vavilla Press (Chennai), 1916.

Puranic Gayatri  Gayatri Devi appears before Vishwamitra rishi. In some puranas, Gayatri is said to be the other names of Sarasvati, the wife of Brahma. According to Matsya Purana, Brahma's left half emerged as a female, who is celebrated under the names of Sarasvati, Savitri and Gayatri. In Kurma Purana, Gautama rishi was blessed by Goddess Gayatri and able to eliminate the obstacles he faced in his life. Skanda Purana tells that Gayatri is the wife of Brahma making her a form of Saraswati Few Puranic scriptures say that Gayatri is distinct from Sarawati and is married to Brahma. Gayatri is a Gurjar girl (cow shepherd) who helps Brahma in Yajna in Pushkar. According Brahma's first wife is Savitri and Gayatri is the second. The story continues that Savitri became angry knowing the wedding of Gayatri with Brahma and cursed all the gods and goddesses engaged in the event. However, the Padma Purana narrates the same story with little modification. After Savitri was appeased by Brahma, Vishnu and Lakshmi, She accepts Gayatri as her sister happily. Gayatri further developed into a fierce goddess who could even slay a demon. According to Varaha Purana and Mahabharata, Goddess Gayatri slayed the demon Vetrasura, the son of Vritra and river Vetravati, on a Navami day.  Shaivite Gayatri  Siddhantic perspective, Gayatri is the consort of Sadasiva, the supreme being Parashivam. Saivism sees Gayatri as the consort of eternal blissful absolute Parashiva who manifests in the form of sun, Sivasurya. He is omnipotent omnipresent Sadasiva, whose name is Bharga. Sadashiva's consort Manonmani is non other than the mantra form of Gayatri who possess the power of her husband Bharga, within her. The popular form of Gayatri with five heads and ten arms was initially found in Saivite iconographies of Manonmani in North India beginning from 10th century CE. Saivite view on Gayatri seems a later development from the combination of vedic practice of Gayatri reverence and its Saivite inclusion as a manifestation of Shakti. This could be the root for the terrific aspect of Gayatri explained in the later puranas as the killer of demon Vetra identifying her with Adi Parashakti. Depiction A modern depiction of goddess Gayatri Earlier bronze images of Gayatri is appeared in the Himachal Pradesh, where she was revered as the consort of Sadasiva. Some of these forms are terrific in nature. One of the bronze images of Gayatri dated back to 10th c. CE was obtained from Champa region and now preserved in Delhi museum. It appears with five faces and ten hands holding, sword, lotus, trident, disc, skull, Varada in left and goad, noose, a manuscript, the jar of ambrosia and Abhaya in right. She resides in the mount Nandi. Modern depictions illustrates swan as her mount. Old iconography of Shaivite Manonmani Gayatri was misunderstood as the same of Brahmanic Gayatri later and Fine paintings of Gayatri appears from 18th century CE in which she is often portrayed with third eye, crescent moon and five heads with five different colors same like Sadasiva. The well known form of Gayatri (Parvati) with the Saivite influence will appear having five heads (Mukta, Vidruma, Hema, Neela, Dhavala) with the ten eyes looking in eight directions plus the earth and sky, and ten arms holding various types of weapons attributed to Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. Another recent depiction is accompanied by a white swan holding a book to portray knowledge in one hand and a cure in the other, as the Goddess of education. She is even depicted four armed mounted on hansa holding weapons symbolizing Tridev. Vedas of Brahma, Discus of Vishnu and trident of Shiva and Varad mudra. She also has an fearsome three-faced depiction; two faces look like that of goddess Kali and one clam one and holding weapons like Mahakali goddess. She is shown mounted on lotus holding lotus, noose, trident, Scimitar and vard mudra in right whereas conch, discus, bow-arrow, goad and abhay mudra in left. 24 Forms of Maa Gayatri According to Shrimad Devi Bhagwat Puran goddess Gayatri is ultimate reality and exist in 24 forms one form for each syllabus of the Gayatri Mantra : 1 Adi Shakti: The manifest cosmos arises from the desire of the absolute (Brahman) to engage in the joy of creation of which we ourselves are a part. The force of that desire of the absolute is Gayatri (Adyashakti or Brahmi-Shakti). All other powers of the manifest cosmic creation are dependent for their existence on this primordial generative force whose attributes are production, development and transformation, and which is the Divine Mother Adya-Shakti Gayatri. 2\\\\. Brahmi or Brahmani: Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva: creation, development, transformation. In creation or production diligence is most necessary and important, as by diligence on contributes to the welfare of others and becomes the object of their thankfulness. These are the prime attributes of Mother Brahmi by whose Shakti Brahma becomes capable of producing the cosmos. 3\\\\. Vaishnavi: Vaishnavi is the power of Vishnu. She is the sustainer, developer and organizer. By another name she is also Lakshmi or the giver of prosperity and culture. Mother Vaishnavi is the sustainer of the good. 4\\\\. Shambhavi aka Maheshwari Matrika: Mother Shambhavi is the divinity of auspicious transformation, productive change and beneficent reconstruction. In another form she is the Shakti of Shiva. 5\\\\. Vedamata: In this form Gayatri is the mother of the Vedas, as the revelations proceeding from 'Om Bhurbhuvasvah' become the Rigveda; from 'tatsaviturvarenyam' the principles of the esoteric knowledge were rendered in the yajurveda; from 'bhargodevasya dhimahi' came the knowledge of the functioning of the universe contained in the samaveda; and from 'dhiyo yonah prachodayat' the secrets of cosmic and divine power were embodied as the athar-vaveda. For this reason Gayatri is referred to in the scriptures as vedamata, or the mother of the Vedas. 6\\\\. Devamata: Gayatri is the celestial mother too, i.e., the bestower of divinity, or of the divine beings. The bestower of divinity, or of the divine beings. The divine beings are divine because they are generous and charitable. The worship of Gayatri as devemata takes us up to the level of divinity by instilling in us the qualities of charity, equanimity, and of right conduct. 7\\\\. Vishvamata: Gayatri is the Universal Mother. She sustains and binds the universe by the spirit of unity. By her grace as Vishvamata man acquires reverence for all living beings and becomes and instrument of social harmony and prosperity. 8\\\\. Mandakini aka Ganga : Seers consider the sacred Ganga as the visible representation of the subtle and invisible Gayatri. Ganga can cleanse the earthly sins, and Gayatri cuts the bondage of karma. For this reason Ganga and Gayatri as taken to be equally auspicious. Ganga as the earthly representative of Gayatri is called Mandakini (the calmly flowing one) who removes our genuinely repented for sins. 9\\\\. Ajapa: In the sadhana of Gayatri a state of grace is reached where the devotee attains a self- maintained contact with god. This state of divine union is called Ajapa (above prayer) state. As it is the power of Gayatri which leads one's soul to this state, she has also been named as Ajapa. 10\\\\. & 11\\\\. Riddhi and Siddhi: Of the twenty-four deities of Gayatri the lord Ganesa is one. Ganesa is the deity of intellect giving it the capacity of discrimination. Ganesa has two female consort divinities, viz., Riddhi and Siddhi. Riddhi is the giver and the substance of the spiritual attainments; and siddhi is the giver of material and physical endowments. And both of them are the powers of Gayatri, one operating internally and the other externally. 12\\\\. Rtambhara: God's greatest gift to man is full cosmic consciousness or perception which when received removes all the bonds of maya. This full cosmic consciousness is Rtambhara Prajna; and Gayatri in her cosmic form is Rtambhara and this realization is self-realisation or Mukti. 13\\\\. Savitri: The primordial shakti has two flows, one immanent and transcendental. I.e., spiritual; and the other manifest, i.e. phenomenal and physical. The spiritual flow is called Gayatri, while the physical is named as Savitri. Savitri is seen as five-faced because the perceptible universe is constituted of five fundamental energy-substances or states. Of all the innumerable forms of Gayatri, Savitri is nearest to us and also the most powerful; and the inter-relationship of Savitri and Gayatri is so close that they can be said to be one and the same. 14\\\\. Lakshmi: Gayatri as the dispenser of material contentment and happiness is Lakshmi. By her grace we find our material circumstances aiding us in our self-development and adding to our capacity for social welfare and good conduct. Excess of material riches without the grace of Lakshmi is an evil and causes social strife, but the same riches blessed by the grace of Lakshmi become a force for social welfare. 15\\\\. Durga \\\\ Kali: Gayatri as the time-force is called Durga or Kali. Life is a battleground where our greatest foes are mostly our own weaknesses of mind and character. By seeking Mother Durga's grace one acquires the strength of spirit to rectify these deficiencies. 16\\\\. Saraswati: Awareness has two polar attributes - the perceiving consciousness and the discriminatory intellect. Gayatri is the motivating force of the perceiving consciousness while the discriminatory intellect functions by the grace of Saraswati. Man is nothing more than a brute without right discrimination. Therefore the grace of Saraswati is necessary for us to sustain our intelligent humanity. 17\\\\. Kundalini: Gayatri as Kundalini is the quiescent material cosmic energy entwined with the individual embodied self. All yoga is concerned with the arousal of Kundalini for self realization. 18\\\\. Annapurna: Food is the first direct necessity for sustaining life. As Annapurna Gayatri is the provident Mother Nature who produces materials made available to us as food. Seeking Gayatri's grace as Annapurna obviates individual want and bestows contentment. 19\\\\. Mahamaya: Human identity being limited the human perception is also incomplete. Maya is delusion and Mahamaya is delusionlessness. Gayatri is called Mahamaya because when she has been realized as Mahamaya the true functioning of the cosmos is fully revealed and the self knows its own divine origin. 20\\\\. Payasvini: Gayatri as the provider of the elixir of immortality in the form of self-realisation is named Payasvini. Cow because she provides us generously with life-giving milk is taken to be the representative of Gayatri from the animal kingdom, and therefore she is held sacred. She is therefore called Payasvini (provider of milk). Cow is also an example to us of benevolence, charity and self-sacrifice, which are the self-same qualities of personal conduct required to realize the grace of Gayatri. 21\\\\. Pranagni: Gayatri is also Pranagni, or the vital fire permeating our bodied self. When Gayatri is realized in this form our weaknesses and deficiencies are consumed by Pranagni and our divine attributes become manifest. 22\\\\. Treyta or Tripura: Gayatri reigns over the three spheres of existence and in which capacity she is known as Tripura. A balanced combination of faith, knowledge and action are necessary for any beneficent human activity, and they are also necessary for realizing the triple attributes of sat-chit-ananda (existence-consciousness- bliss) of the all-containing Brahman. By the grace of Gayatri this state of realization is reached. 23\\\\. Bhavani: The evil-destroying power of Gayatri becomes personified as Bhavani who is the defender of the good, the meek and the down trodden and defenseless. 24\\\\. Bhuvaneswari: Gayatri as the divine sustainer-force of the universal harmony and well-being and as the goddess of the individual's prosperity and happiness is called Bhuvaneswari. By right social effort we earn her grace. Festivals - Gayatri Jayanti and Navratri=Gayatri Jayanti This holiday recognizes the day when Maa Adishakti took form of Gayatri to kill Vetrasur. It has 2 dates both are believed in different areas of India one is on Shravan Purnima and other on Shukla Paksha Ekadashi during Jyeshtha lunar month and it is usually observed on the next day of Ganga Dussehra. Navratri She is worshipped during Navratri as all the forms of Maa Adishakti are worshipped in those days.

Accepting its influence be thou absorbed in the Sun, And it shall in its own likeness make thee All-Luminous.\\" Meaning and significance Gayatri mantra recommends meditating upon causation across the multiple translations to believe in the purifying direction of Divine insight, direction of the senses, inspire understanding and intellect, progress, journey to the sacred seat, choosing the right path for us, visualize the sun within ourselves because as above it exists below. Gayatri mantra suggests Bhoor, this implies existence, and signifies Prana, life, or life breath. The mantra suggests tat, meaning \\"that\\", offer of praise to the Him is to expect that no such praise or personal benefits are offered in return or expectation of gain. This word tat and prayer indicates a selfless belief and practice, the mantra as well as the holy word \\"Om\\", is given to God with pure direction. Savitur indicates God's existence as a fountain, which springs forth all life and all things, which we go from and go back to. Bhargo is the purifying of the intellect, as ore is refined in the flames, we too are purified by the words, destroying all sins and afflictions, we are cleansed by His grace and are in unity and oneness with Him. Oneness with Him is free from impurities in thought. 24 Letters of Gayatri mantra Gayatri mantra has 24 letters. They are 1.tat, 2.sa, 3.vi, 4.tur, 5.va, 6.re, 7.·πái, 8.ya·πÉ, 9.bhar, 10,go, 11.de, 12.va, 13.sya, 14.dhƒ´, 15.ma, 16.hi, 17.dhi, 18.yo, 19.yo, 20.na·∏•, 21.pra, 22.cho 23.da and 24.yƒÅt. When counting the letters, the word vare·πáyam is treated as vare·πáiyam. But, while chanting, it ought to be chanted as vare·πáyam only. Textual appearances=Vedic and Vedantic literature The Gayatri mantra is cited widely in Vedic and post-Vedic texts, such as the mantra listings of the ≈örauta liturgy, and cited several times in the Brahmanas and the Srauta- sutras. It is also cited in a number of grhyasutras, mostly in connection with the upanayana ceremonyShankhayana grhyasutra: 2.5.12, 2.7.19; Khadira grhyasutra: 2.4.21; Apastambha grhyasutra: 4.10.9-12; Varaha grhyasutra: 5.26 in which it has a significant role. The Gayatri mantra is the subject of esoteric treatment and explanation in some major Upanishads, including Mukhya Upanishads such as the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad and the Maitrayaniya Upanishad; as well as other well-known works such as the Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana. The text also appears in minor Upanishads, such as the Surya Upanishad. The Gayatri mantra is the apparent inspiration for derivative \\"gƒÅyatrƒ´\\" stanzas dedicated to other deities. Those derivations are patterned on the formula ,Ravi Varma(1956), p.460f, Gonda(1963) p.292 and have been interpolatedKeith, Vol I. p.lxxxi into some recensions of the Shatarudriya litany. GƒÅyatrƒ´s of this form are also found in the Mahanarayana Upanishad. The Gayatri mantra is also repeated and cited widely in classical Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, Harivamsa, and Manusm·πõti. Buddhist corpus  In Majjhima Nikaya 92, the Buddha refers to the SƒÅvitri (Pali: sƒÅvittƒ´) mantra as the foremost meter, in the same sense as the king is foremost among humans, or the sun is foremost among lights: In Sutta Nipata 3.4, the Buddha uses the SƒÅvitri mantra as a paradigmatic indicator of Brahmanic knowledge:  Usage =Upanayana ceremony Imparting the Gayatri mantra to young Hindu men is an important part of the traditional upanayana ceremony, which marks the beginning of study of the Vedas. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan described this as the essence of the ceremony, which is sometimes called \\"Gayatri diksha\\", i.e. initiation into the Gayatri mantra. However, traditionally, the stanza RV.3.62.10 is imparted only to Brahmin boys. Other Gayatri verses are used in the upanayana ceremony for non- Brahmins: RV.1.35.2, in the tristubh meter, for a kshatriya and either RV.1.35.9 or RV.4.40.5 in the jagati meter for a Vaishya.This is on the authority of the Shankhayana Grhyasutra, 2.5.4-7 and 2.7.10. J. Gonda, \\"The Indian mantra\\", Oriens, Vol. 16, (31 December 1963), p. 285 Mantra- recitation Gayatri Japa. 1851 painting Gayatri japa is used as a method of prƒÅya≈õcitta (atonement). It is believed by practitioners that reciting the mantra bestows wisdom and enlightenment, through the vehicle of the Sun (Savitr), who represents the source and inspiration of the universe. Brahmo Samaj In 1827 Ram Mohan Roy published a dissertation on the Gayatri mantraTitle of the text was Prescript for offering supreme worship by means of the Gayutree, the most sacred of the Veds. that analysed it in the context of various Upanishads. Roy prescribed a Brahmin to always pronounce om at the beginning and end of the Gayatri mantra. From 1830, the Gayatri mantra was used for private devotion of Brahmos. In 1843, the First Covenant of Brahmo Samaj required Gayatri mantra for Divine Worship. From 1848-1850 with the rejection of Vedas, the Adi Dharma Brahmins use the Gayatri mantra in their private devotions.Sivanath Sastri \\"History of the Brahmo Samaj\\" 1911/1912 1st edn. publ. Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, 211 Cornwallis St. Calcutta Hindu revivalism In the later 19th century, Hindu reform movements spread the chanting of the Gayatri mantra. In 1898 for example, Swami Vivekananda claimed that, according to the Vedas and the Bhagavad Gita, a person became Brahmin through learning from his Guru, and not because of birth. He administered the sacred thread ceremony and the Gayatri mantra to non-Brahmins in Ramakrishna Mission. This Hindu mantra has been popularized to the masses, outside of Brahminic culture through pendants, audio recordings and mock scrolls. Various Gayatri yaj√±as organised by All World Gayatri Pariwar at small and large scales in late twentieth century also helped spread Gayatri mantra to the mass. Indonesian Hinduism The Gayatri Mantra forms the first of seven sections of the TrisandhyƒÅ Puja (Sanskrit for \\"three divisions\\"), a prayer used by the Balinese Hindus and many Hindus in Indonesia. It is uttered three times each day: 6 am at morning, noon, and 6 pm at evening. Island Secrets: Stories of Love, Lust and Loss in BaliRenegotiating Boundaries: Local Politics in Post-Suharto Indonesia  Popular culture  A version of the Gayatri mantra is featured in the opening theme song of the TV series Battlestar Galactica (2004).Battlestar Galactica's Cylon Dream Kit A variation on the William Quan Judge translation is also used as the introduction to Kate Bush's song \\"Lily\\" on her 1993 album, The Red Shoes. In her Living Proof: The Farewell Tour the singer/actress Cher sang Gayatri mantra while riding a mechanical elephant. She later reprised the performance during her Classic Cher tour. The Swiss avantgarde black metal band Schammasch adapted the mantra as the outro in their song \\"The Empyrean\\" on their last album \\"Triangle\\" as a Gregorian chant.

Primarily created by Chuck Cuidera with input from both Bob Powell and Will Eisner, the Blackhawk characters first appeared in Military Comics #1 (August 1941). Led by a mysterious man known as Blackhawk, the Blackhawks (or more formally, the Blackhawk Squadron) are a small team of World War II-era ace pilots of varied nationalities, each typically known under a single name, either their given name or their surname. Though the membership roster has undergone changes over the years, the team has been portrayed most consistently as having seven core members. In their most well-known incarnation, the Blackhawks operate from a hidden base known only as Blackhawk Island, fly Grumman XF5F Skyrocket planes, and shout their battle cry of \\"Hawk-a-a-a!\\" as they descend from the skies to fight tyranny and oppression. Clad in matching blue and black uniforms (with Blackhawk himself boasting a hawk insignia on his chest), early stories pitted the team against the Axis powers, but they would also come to battle recurring foes such as King Condor and Killer Shark, as well as encounter an array of gorgeous and deadly femme fatales. They also frequently squared off against fantastical war machines ranging from amphibious \\"shark planes\\" and flying tanks, to the aptly named War Wheel, a gigantic rolling behemoth adorned with spikes and machine guns. At the height of his popularity in the early 1940s, Blackhawk titles routinely outsold every other comic book but Superman.Murry, Will. \\"An interview with Chuck 'Blackhawk' Cuidera\\". Comic Book Marketplace #68, May 1999. Blackhawk also shares the distinction of being just one of five comic book superheroes to be published continuously in their own titles from the 1940s up to the 1960s (the others being Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and The Phantom). The comic series has spawned a film serial, a radio series, a novel and a future Steven Spielberg-produced feature film. A grounded version of Blackhawk named Ted Gaynor appeared in the first season of Arrow played by Ben Browder. Publication history=Creation Like many of his golden age and silver age comic book counterparts, the creation of Blackhawk has been the subject of sometimes-contentious debate. Will Eisner has at times been considered the characters' primary creator, with Eisner himself acknowledging the contributions of Chuck Cuidera and writer Bob Powell.Yronwode, Catherine. \\"Who's Who: An Interview With Will Eisner\\". Blackhawk #260 (July 1983). DC Comics. Over the years, Cuidera became increasingly vocal that he did much more work on Blackhawk than Eisner and that he had in fact already started creating the characters prior to joining Eisner's studio.Schumacher, Michael. Will Eisner: A Dreamer's Life in Comics. (Bloomsbury USA, 2010). pp. 72‚Äì73. According to Cuidera, he and Powell fleshed out the concept, deciding on everything from names and nationalities, to the characters' distinguishing traits, uniforms, and the aircraft they would fly.Steranko, Jim. The Steranko History of Comics Volume 2. (Supergraphics, 1972). pp. 52‚Äì61. In 1999, Eisner addressed his view of the matter during a Comic-Con panel: The Quality Comics years Military Comics #18 (April 1943): Art by Reed Crandall. The Blackhawks debuted in August 1941 as the lead feature in the first issue of Quality Comics' anthology series Military Comics, billed as featuring \\"stories of the Army and Navy\\". Viewed by Will Eisner as \\"a modern version of the Robin Hood legend\\", the team's first appearance was co-written by Chuck Cuidera and Bob Powell, with art by Cuidera. Although the exact nature of Eisner, Cuidera, and Powell's individual contributions to the creation of the Blackhawks will never be known, it is confirmed that each performed some level of writing duties at different times during the first eleven issues, with Eisner working on early covers with Cuidera and Cuidera providing interior artwork. When Cuidera joined the armed services in 1942, Reed Crandall took over as artist, beginning a long association with the characters that would last until 1953. Jim Steranko has observed, \\"where Cuidera made Blackhawk a best-seller, Crandall turned it into a classic, a work of major importance and lasting value\\". It was during Crandall's run that the series hit its sales and popularity zenith. The Blackhawks' success earned them their own title in Winter 1944. That issue, Blackhawk #9, picked up the numbering of Quality's canceled Uncle Sam Quarterly. They meanwhile continued to be featured prominently in Military Comics, later renamed Modern Comics, until that book's cancellation with #102 (October 1950). During the Quality years, a whole host of well-respected talent worked on the character, including writers Manly Wade Wellman, Bill Woolfolk, Bill Finger, and Dick French,Evanier, Mark (2001). The Blackhawk Archives Volume 1. Foreword by Mark Evanier. DC Comics. p. 9. as well as artists Al Bryant, Bill Ward, and Dick Dillin. It was French, also an accomplished songwriter, who infused the team with the quirky desire to sing celebratory songs from their cockpits as they swooped in and out of battle.Misiroglu, Gina Renee Misiroglu; Roach, David A. (2005). The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-Book Icons and Hollywood Heroes. Omnigraphics, Inc. pp. 87‚Äì90. Archived at Google Books. Retrieved April 8, 2013. Quality Comics ceased operations with comics cover-dated December 1956, with Blackhawk #107 being the final issue published by Quality. The character and title trademarks were initially leased on a royalty basis to National Periodical Publications (now DC Comics) before eventually being sold in their entirety. Acquired by DC Comics Blackhawk was one of the few Quality series that DC chose to keep running uninterrupted. Penciller Dick Dillin and inker Chuck Cuidera remained on the title, ensuring a near-seamless transition. The duo would stay with the title through nearly its entire first run at DC. Steering deeper and deeper into the realm of science fiction, the Blackhawks found themselves confronting a steady stream of unmemorable and mostly one-off supervillain-like adversaries bent on world domination. The Blackhawks also gained a new ally in Blackhawk #133 (February 1959): Lady Blackhawk, a pilot named Zinda Blake who was determined to become the first female member of the team. After a couple of appearances, she was granted honorary status and became a semi-frequent member of the supporting cast. In an effort to update the characters, DC gave the team its first ever major wardrobe overhaul in Blackhawk #197 (June 1964), replacing their longtime uniforms with red and black shirts and green pants. On a dramatic level, Lady Blackhawk was transformed into a supervillain, Queen Killer Shark, in Blackhawk #200 (September 1964). Then, in a much more drastic attempt to combat flagging sales due to the rising popularity of superhero books and the Batman TV series, DC proclaimed with Blackhawk #228 (January 1967) the beginning of \\"the New Blackhawk Era\\" with a cover featuring Justice League of America members Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, and the Flash observing that the Blackhawks are (in Superman's words) \\"washed up\\" and (in Batman's words) \\"junk-heap heroes\\". In the issues that followed, all but Blackhawk gained a costumed superhero alter ego at the behest of a shadowy government agency. With sales continuing to sink, the Blackhawks were restored to something that more closely resembled their original roots in Blackhawk #242 (August 1968), losing the superhero identities in favor of their traditional blue and black uniforms. It was too late though; the comic was canceled for the first time one issue later. 1970s Just over seven years later, DC Comics resurrected the series with Blackhawk #244 (January 1976) as part of an ongoing mid-1970s expansion of the line dubbed \\"Conway's Corner\\" in house ads. The Blackhawks were transplanted to the 1970s and now portrayed as mercenaries-for-hire, matching wits against fancifully bizarre new villains, as well as a re-imagined Killer Shark and War Wheel. This run ended with Blackhawk #250 (January 1977). 1980s‚Äì1990s Amid rampant rumors that Steven Spielberg was interested in Blackhawk as a possible film project, DC Comics once again resumed the series. Initially conceived as being published quarterly, editor Len Wein convinced DC to make the book monthly and eventually assembled a team that included writer Mark Evanier and artist Dan Spiegle.Kooiman, Mike. \\"Mark Evanier discusses Blackhawk and Plastic Man\\". \\"The Quality Companion Companion\\". Blackhawk #251 (October 1982) returned the team to a World War II setting and restored many of the familiar trappings that had been shed over the years during the various attempts to modernize the characters. Numerous new supporting characters were introduced during the run, most notably Domino, a buxom Nazi assassin and love interest to Blackhawk who was reminiscent of the femme fatales so common during the Quality Comics era. Evanier also reintroduced arch-villain Killer Shark, and has said he would have likely added Lady Blackhawk to the cast had the series lasted longer. But faced with stagnant sales that Evanier attributed largely to DC's lack of interest in publicizing the series, the book was canceled with Blackhawk #273 (November 1984). Though it wouldn't be known at the time, that issue would mark the definitive end of the series' original issue numbering. Sometime after the cancellation, DC employed writer Bill DuBay and artist Carmine Infantino to produce a Blackhawk mini-series. Though never published, numerous finished pages exist.Amash, Jim; Nolen-Weathington, Eric (2010). Carmine Infantino: Penciler, Publisher, Provocateur. TwoMorrows Publishing. pp. 218‚Äì219. Archived at Google Books. Retrieved April 8, 2013. In 1988, a three- issue mini-series by Howard Chaykin re-imagined the team during World War II yet again, this time with a notably more adult and gritty take on the characters. Chaykin, for the most part, eschewed the team dynamic so familiar to Blackhawk readers, instead crafting a politically charged espionage thriller that focused prominently on Blackhawk and a new version of Lady Blackhawk. Post-war stories respecting Chaykin's continuity followed in Action Comics Weekly #601‚Äì608, #615‚Äì622, and #628‚Äì635, as well as in a monthly series that restarted with an issue #1 and ran 16 issues from March 1989 to August 1990. In 1992, DC Comics published Blackhawk Special #1. Still respecting Chaykin's continuity and set 10 years after the events of Blackhawk #16, the story spans a five-year period as Blackhawk seeks to avenge the death of team member Andr√©. More recent appearances Since 1992, mostly modern hints of the team have appeared, usually in the form of the \\"Blackhawk Express\\" courier service, or the time-displaced Lady Blackhawk. One of the best examples of this is the 1990s appearance of team member Chop-Chop in a few issues of DC's Hawkworld series. Other Blackhawk air pilot groups have been shown during present time or alternate future events such as Our Worlds At War and Kingdom Come. It is unknown which connection beyond homage and inspiration, if any, those groups have to the classic Blackhawks. Blackhawk at this time is an extension of Checkmate. DC Comics reprinted the Blackhawk features from the first 17 issues of Military Comics in The Blackhawk Archives Volume 1 (2001) as part of its hardcover DC Archive Editions series. Blackhawk made an appearance in The Brave and the Bold Vol. 3 #9 (February 2008), teaming up with the Boy Commandos during a World War II tale. The Blackhawks appeared in Superman & Batman: Generations 2, in which they help Superman, Spectre, and Hawkman battle a robot during the war. During the battle, Chuck sacrifices himself to destroy a missile. During the same storyline in 1997, a heroine named Blackhawk appears, battling Sinestro. According to John Byrne's liner notes in Generations 3 #1, this character is Janet Hall, the granddaughter of the original Blackhawk, as well as Hawkman (Carter Hall) and Hawkgirl (Shiera Sanders). The New 52 In September 2011 as part of its New 52 publishing revamp, DC Comics launched a monthly series titled Blackhawks with no direct ties to the previous incarnations. The book is set in the present day with no appearances by, or mention of, prior Blackhawks, although there is a new version of the Lady Blackhawk character. The book shares the setting of the rebooted DC Universe continuity set up in the Flashpoint mini- series.http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/09/welcome-to-the-edge/ The series ended with Blackhawks #8 (April 2012) to make way for a \\"second wave\\" of New 52 titles. Fictional team history=Original incarnation Blackhawk #12 (Autumn 1946). Cover art by Al Bryant. With the overwhelming forces of Nazi Germany flooding into Poland in September, 1939, only the Polish Air Force remains as the last major line of resistance. Captain von Tepp and his Butcher Squadron swarm the skies in response, outnumbering the Polish four to one. The Germans decimate their foes until just one lone plane ‚Äî painted jet black ‚Äî remains. After gallantly shooting down six Nazi planes, the mysterious pilot is forced to crash land on the countryside. Running to a nearby farmhouse, he's tracked from the air by von Tepp, who drops a bomb and destroys the building. The pilot locates his dead sister and mortally wounded brother inside. He vows to kill von Tepp before disappearing into the darkness. Months later, with most of Europe collapsing under the might of the Nazis, the pilot reemerges with his own private squadron and \\"like an angel of vengeance, Blackhawk and his men swoop down out of nowhere, their guns belching death, and on their lips the dreaded song of the Blackhawks\\". In France, Captain von Tepp receives a note from Blackhawk demanding the release of one of Blackhawk's men or face death. Infuriated, von Tepp orders the prisoner's execution by firing squad. At dawn, the man and two others, including a cool- headed English Red Cross nurse (identified as \\"Ann\\" in Military Comics #3), are lined against a wall and mocked by von Tepp. As his men prepare to fire, the song of the Blackhawks fills the air: With the Blackhawks lining the walls of the courtyard, Blackhawk himself confronts von Tepp. After a brief skirmish, von Tepp is abducted and flown to the Blackhawks' secret base in the Atlantic Ocean, Blackhawk Island. It's there that Blackhawk challenges the Nazi captain to an aerial duel. During the ensuring dogfight, both of the men's planes are crippled and forced to crash. On the ground, von Tepp and Blackhawk, both badly injured, draw guns. Von Tepp falls in a hail of bullets. Blackhawk's team is mostly depicted in Military Comics #1 as shadowy, nondescript soldiers, save for an Englishman named Baker who's never seen or mentioned again. Military Comics #2 (September 1941) expands the role of the team in the featured adventure and introduces five members: Stanislaus, Andr√©, Olaf, Hendrick (Hendrickson within a few issues), and Zeg. A sixth, Boris, is also shown, but, like Baker, only makes a single appearance. The designer of their planes, Vladim, is also mentioned. By Military Comics #3 (October 1941), the roster is firmed up and it's stated that seven men belong to the team. The group also receives a Chinese mascot and cook, Chop-Chop, when his plane happens to crash on Blackhawk Island during a desperate run for help. The adventure concludes with the first on-page death of a team member: Andr√©, who seemingly perishes in an avalanche that buries a large group of Nazis. In Military Comics #9 (April 1942), the roster is down to five plus Chop-Chop, with Zeg presumably the absent member. In that adventure, the team crosses paths with the mysterious Man in the Iron Mask; Andr√©, in fact, now horribly disfigured, but still an enemy of the Nazis. The most familiar version of the team is finally locked down in Military Comics #11 (August 1942) shown as consisting of Blackhawk, Olaf, Chuck, Andr√© (his face now reconstructed), Stanislaus, Hendrickson, and Chop-Chop. In Blackhawk #50 (March 1952), the team's origin is documented. Blackhawk himself is no longer identified as being Polish, but rather a Polish-American who is a volunteer flyer in the Polish Air Force. His sidekick in the squadron is Stanislaus, a \\"brilliant young student\\" from the University of Warsaw. After facing defeat against the Nazis, Blackhawk attempts to flee to Russia, only to discover that Russian forces are invading from the east. He then seeks refuge in England where he attempts to join the Royal Air Force. It's in London where he and Stanislaus reunite and then meet the four others who will ultimately join them in their crusade: Chuck, another American volunteer; Hendrickson, a recent escapee from a Nazi concentration camp; Olaf, a Swede who had fought for Finland against the Russians; and Andr√©, a \\"valiant Frenchman\\". The six men wait to enlist in the R.A.F., but because none are British subjects, they are \\"held up by miles of red tape\\". Finally, Blackhawk suggests they strike out on their own. They pool their resources and buy planes, setting up a base of operations first on a small island in the Atlantic Ocean, then later in the Pacific. They're eventually joined by Chop-Chop, described in this account as having \\"fled from China when the Japanese overpowered the Nationalist army\\". Chop-Chop first acts as the team's cook, but in time becomes an expert pilot and full member of the team. Post-Crisis After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Blackhawk is once again Polish by birth and now given a definitive name, Janos Prohaska. Having joined the Polish Air Force at a young age, he had already become a national hero by 1936 alongside his trusted friends Stanislaus Drozdowski and Kazimierc \\"Zeg\\" Zegota-Januszajtis. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, the trio travel across Europe, providing freelance service and even fighting for a time in the Spanish Civil War as members of the Communist party. At one point finding himself in America in hopes of gathering funds to build a European resistance group, Prohaska is framed for a series of murders. With the help of the Sandman, he's ultimately exonerated, but a report soon surfaces that he has been shot down and killed by Nazis somewhere in the Mediterranean. When the forces of Nazi Germany invade Poland in 1939, Prohaska returns home to help defend his homeland. He's unable to save his younger siblings, J√≥zek and Staszka, and soon forced to flee to Britain with Stanislaus and Zeg. It's there he meets the others who will form the foundation of the Blackhawk Squadron. In the midst of the war, Prohaska finds himself under suspicion by the U.S. government for his Communist ties. Around this same time, the Blackhawks are joined by Captain Natalie Reed (born Natalie Gurdin), a brilliant Russian-American flight engineer who redesigns the Blackhawks' aircraft and is dubbed Lady Blackhawk by the U.S. press. It's with her help that Prohaska is able to stop Nazi agent and onetime Hollywood actor Death Mayhew from detonating an atomic bomb in New York City. The victory restores Blackhawk's reputation. The New 52 In 2011, the entire line of DC Comics was rebooted as part of \\"The New 52\\". In this new version the Blackhawks are an elite covert military unit taking care of High Technology Criminals. During this period their main mission was to deal with terrorist group \\"Mother Machine\\". During this storyline their cover is exposed and their existence becomes known to the public and the team must deal with the backlash as well. Rebirth In Dark Nights: Metal #1, Kendra Saunders is introduced as Lady Blackhawk, she is now the leader of the Blackhawks, an anti-apocalyptic team with the mission to prevent the Dark Multiverse from destroying Earth-0. She also introduces the Blackhawk Island, a place where cosmic energy conducted through the earth's metal core cancel's itself out, creating a kind of static that disrupts space-time, the Island served as well for many years as a base of operations for Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Lady Blackhawk and the Blackhawks are featured in All-Star Batman second arc, \\"Ends of Earth\\", they are seen hounding Batman, and they are shown to possesses an armor that has the ability to track eye-line movement, the armor also turns them invisible. Team depictions=Original incarnation After a period of membership fluctuations during the first 10 issues of Military Comics, the team finally settles into its most famous roster. Although minor character details would shift and change over time, this original version of the team would stay largely intact from the characters' debut in 1941 to the end of their first run in 1968. At one point or another, every member of the team except Blackhawk is depicted in ways stereotypical for the time, and over the course of the series several would develop their own catchphrases. * Blackhawk ‚Äì first Polish, then American, the man known as Blackhawk is portrayed as a strong, decisive leader. He's not always easy on his men‚Äîcalling Olaf a \\"big fat-head\\", for example‚Äîbut always appears to command their unquestionable respect. At one point late in the first series' run, he's given a name, Bart Hawk. * Stanislaus ‚Äì Blackhawk's second-in-command. Polish, Stan is initially depicted like his teammates with various ethnic distinctions, but those disappear as the series progresses to the point that he could very well pass for an American. He is often portrayed as an acrobat, then later as the team's strongman. * Chuck ‚Äì at different times stated as being from Brooklyn or Texas, Chuck is often shown as the team's communications specialist. His words are peppered with frequent American colloquialisms like \\"I reckon!\\" and \\"Dagnabbit!\\" * Hendrickson ‚Äì known as \\"Hendy\\" for short, the oldest of the Blackhawks is also their ever-dependable sharpshooter. Heavyset with white hair and a thick, Germanic mustache, he's usually portrayed as Dutch (though German in some accounts), and often exclaims, \\"Himmel!\\" (German for \\"sky\\" and \\"heaven\\") or \\"Ach du lieber!\\" (a German phrase akin to \\"Oh, dear!\\"). * Andr√© ‚Äì with his pencil-thin mustache and natural born suavity, Andr√©'s appreciation of beautiful women often leads the team into precarious situations. Their demolitions expert, he frequently utters \\"Sacre bleu!\\" (an old French profanity). * Olaf ‚Äì a giant of a man, Olaf is usually portrayed as Swedish, his brutish size and poor English playing into the \\"big, dumb Swede\\" stereotype. He often shouts, \\"Py Yiminy!\\" and demonstrates impressive acrobatic abilities (a trait that Stanislaus' character loses over time). * Chop-Chop ‚Äì Chop-Chop is originally the team's Chinese cook and essentially Blackhawk's sidekick, riding along in Blackhawk's plane as opposed to piloting his own. He evolves over time from comic relief mascot to a valued member of the team proficient in the martial arts. His full name is eventually revealed to be Liu Huang. Other short-term members are Baker, an Englishman, and Boris, a Russian. Both characters only make single panel appearances. Zeg, Polish like Blackhawk and Stanislaus, manages to last a bit longer, but is gone by the Blackhawk's ninth appearance in Military Comics. A significant ally to the team throughout the 1940s is Miss Fear, who never formally joins the group but appears frequently during their Asian missions, developing a romantic interest in Blackhawk himself. The strip's most significant supporting character, however, is Zinda Blake, also known as Lady Blackhawk. After a failed attempt to become the team's first female member, she is eventually awarded honorary status and makes numerous appears from 1959 to 1968, even becoming the villainess Queen Killer Shark for a time. The team acquires an animal mascot in the 1950s, Blackie the hawk. Possessing remarkable intelligence he can type notes in plain English, among other skills and fitted with his own miniature belt radio, he's often shown perched on Blackhawk's shoulder. 1967's New Blackhawk Era Blackhawk #230 (March, 1967): The Blackhawks adopt alter- egos. Art by Dick Dillin. When the Blackhawks are proven by the secret spy organization G.E.O.R.G.E. (the Group for Extermination of Organizations of Revenge, Greed, and Evil) to be inept and ineffective as a modern-day fighting force against the evils of the world, the team regroups and dons dramatic new identities that, as the U.S. President happily observes, returns them to their rightful place as one of America's \\"top trouble-shooting teams\\". For 14 issues beginning with Blackhawk #228 (January 1967), the Blackhawks become: * The Big Eye (Blackhawk) ‚Äì Constantly monitoring the activities of his squad from the Hawk-Kite, a mammoth dirigible made to look like a two-headed hawk, Blackhawk is the only one of the seven to not take on a new alter-ego. * The Golden Centurion (Stanislaus) ‚Äì Clad in the gleaming gold armor of a dead foe, Stan not only gains the ability to fly, but can also fire bolts of \\"ionized pure gold\\". * The Listener (Chuck) ‚Äì Chuck facilitates communication between the team, wearing what resembles pajamas covered with drawings of ears. * The Weapons-Master (Hendrickson) ‚Äì Hendy is the team's master of weaponry. * M'sieu Machine (Andr√©) ‚Äì Andr√© becomes designer of exotic crime-fighting gadgets. * The Leaper (Olaf) ‚Äì Donning a rubber-titanium outfit reminiscent of a human cannonball circus performer, Olaf's natural acrobatic abilities are now complemented with the ability to leap and bounce great distances. * Dr. Hands (Chop-Chop) ‚Äì Mixing martial arts with beryllium-encased hands, Chop- Chop is able to \\"smash through practically anything\\". The change was very unpopular; in the span of a year, the series lost an average 71,000 readers per issue. The \\"New Blackhawk Era\\" ends after just 14 issues when G.E.O.R.G.E. headquarters is unceremoniously destroyed, leaving the Blackhawks with only their classic blue and black uniforms. 1976‚Äì1977 When the series resumes in 1976, it features a mercenary team composed of familiar unaged faces. Their origins and place in the DC Universe are never explained, though it is firmly stated that this version of the Blackhawks consists of \\"the original seven\\" and surmises that they had \\"first banded together in the fifties to battle a growing number of costumed villains and foes\\". The members of the team are described as follows: * Blackhawk (also referred to as Bart Hawk and Mr. Cunningham) ‚Äì The head of one of the largest aircraft manufacturing companies in the world, and a man who commands \\"a working knowledge of science with specialties in aviation and aerodynamics\\". * Stanislaus ‚Äì The Polish \\"financial wizard\\" of Cunningham Aircraft. * Andr√© ‚Äì The French mechanics expert. * Olaf ‚Äì The Swedish junior member of the group. * Hendrickson ‚Äì The Dutch elder of the group and the full-time \\"sentinel\\" of the team's secret base, Blackhawk Island. * Chuck ‚Äì The American communications expert and team scientist. * Chopper (formerly known as Chop-Chop) ‚Äì The Chinese master of martial arts and the team's most skilled flier, \\"save for Blackhawk himself\\". Early in the run, Boris - \\"the eighth Blackhawk\\", as he refers to himself - reemerges as the super-powered villain Anti-Man, hellbent on destroying the team as revenge for leaving him for dead on a long ago mission. Shown in flashback wearing the Blackhawks' classic blue and black uniform, even then as a member he exhibits surprising aggression toward his teammates. With Hendrickson left ailing in the final issue of the run, and Chuck seemingly killed in battle, it's possible that big changes were in store for the team's line-up had the series continued past Blackhawk #250. Two possible replacements are set up, either of whom could have also taken the mantle of Lady Blackhawk: Duchess Ramona Fatale (also referred to as \\"Patch\\"), a mercenary with questionable allegiances, but harboring love for Blackhawk; and Elsa, Hendrickson's daughter. 1982‚Äì1984 With the team's return to a World War II setting, many basic aspects of the original incarnation are restored, complemented by what writer Mark Evanier called \\"a more contemporary attitude towards characterization\\". The core members are: * Blackhawk ‚Äì Described as \\"Polish American\\" and referred to as Bart on a few occasions. He abhors killing, doing so only in self-defense. He's strong and level-headed, not always reacting as swiftly or as violently as some of his men might like. * Stanislaus ‚Äì Blackhawk's Polish second-in-command and loyal friend. Lacking confidence from being in Blackhawk's shadow for so long, he envies Blackhawk's strong leadership capabilities. * Andr√© ‚Äì A former member of the French resistance, he's the team's experienced military planner and full-time ladies' man. * Olaf ‚Äì A Swede whose tall height and thick accent plays into a common stereotype, but in actuality conceals amazing acrobatic skills and a savvy mind in combat. * Hendrickson ‚Äì The team's Dutch weapons master and sharpshooter. The oldest of the group, he grapples with feelings of resentment, often left feeling like his much-younger teammates don't always make full use of his wisdom. * Chuck ‚Äì A Texan who volunteered for the British R.A.F. before bringing his expert piloting and mechanic skills to the Blackhawks. He is portrayed as tougher and more rude than previous depictions. * Chop-Chop ‚Äì Both the youngest and the newest member of the team, he's a martial arts master named Wu Cheng. Also introduced during the run is Lieutenant Theodore Gaynor of the United States Marine Corps, who joins the team when Chop-Chop takes a leave of absence to fight the Japanese in China. Gaynor leaves the team after it is learned his hardline stance against the Germans includes the execution of not only Nazi soldiers, but also civilians. 1988‚Äìpresent After the Crisis on Infinite Earths rewrites the history of the DC Universe, the Blackhawks' own history, both during World War II and after, undergoes yet more transformation. The members are: * Major Janos Prohaska (Blackhawk) ‚Äì Reestablished as being born and raised in Poland, Prohaska is portrayed as the consummate leader, but also as a brash, hard- drinking womanizer. He is also revealed to have been a member of the Communist Party, expelled by Joseph Stalin after opposing the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, a 1939 treaty of non-aggression between the Soviets and Nazi Germany. * Captain Stanislaus Drozdowski ‚Äì Longtime friend of Blackhawk's who fights alongside him in the Polish Air Force before becoming one of the earliest members of the Blackhawks‚Äîand one of the team's first casualties. * Captain Andr√© Blanc- Dumont ‚Äì An excellent but slightly reckless pilot, the Frenchman is second-in- command of the team, as well as Prohaska's closest confidant and frequent co- pilot. * Captain Olaf Friedriksen ‚Äì Danish in this version, athletic Olaf is a savant with languages and skilled at radio operations. * Captain Ritter Hendricksen ‚Äì The Dutch marksmen and demolitions expert, as well as the oldest member of the team. * Captain Carlo \\"Chuck\\" Sirianni ‚Äì An Italian-American from New Jersey who served with the U.S. Office of Strategic Services before joining the team and becoming their chief navigation officer. Chuck is also a dabbler in electronics and aeronautic technology. * Lieutenant Weng Chan (Chop-Chop) ‚Äì Chinese and said to be just 17 when he first joins the team, Weng is a skilled pilot, flight mechanic, and cook. * Captain Natalie Reed (Lady Blackhawk) ‚Äì Brilliant Russian-American flight engineer who redesigns the Blackhawks' aircraft and fights alongside them. She gives birth to a son in 1945, the product of a brief affair with Hendricksen. Other early members of the team include Russians Boris Zinoviev and Kazimierc \\"Zeg\\" Zegota- Januszajtis, and Englishman Ian Holcomb-Baker, who are \\"the first to fall in battle\\". Later team members include African-American Grover Baines, Malaysian Quan Chee Keng (known as \\"Mairzey\\"), and Mexican Paco Herrera. 2011‚Äìpresent Core members of the Blackhawk Squadron as depicted in the New 52 era: * Colonel Andrew Lincoln ‚Äì Deputy of operations. * Lady Blackhawk * Kunoichi ‚Äì Japanese field operative. * The Irishman ‚Äì Ukrainian field operative. * Attila ‚Äì Hungarian field operative. * Canada * Wildman ‚Äì Field support operative. Evolution of Chop-Chop The longtime depiction of Chop- Chop, with art by Reed Crandall. The version portrayed here in 1943 played on racist stereotypes against East Asians, particularly during World War II. Throughout the 1940s and well into the 1950s, Chop-Chop provides comic relief in the Blackhawk strip and is depicted as more of a highly exaggerative caricature amid the realistic art style that otherwise surrounds him. Fat, buck-toothed, and orange-skinned, he speaks in broken English, wears a queue hairstyle complete with a bow, and dresses in colorful coolie garb. This depiction, although now considered offensive by many, was not atypical of World War II-era depictions of Asians especially the Japanese.Zimmerman, Carla B. \\"From Chop-Chop to Wu Cheng: The Evolution of the Chinese Character in Blackhawk Comic Books,\\" in Ethnic Images in the Comics, edited by Charles Hardy and Gail F. Stern (The Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies,1986) pp. 37‚Äì42. A popular character at the time, Chop-Chop also appears in his own humor feature in the Blackhawk series from 1946 to 1955. Even in his very earliest appearances, he demonstrates tremendous competency and bravery, arriving on Blackhawk Island in a plane of his own construction, and then, relatively soon after, is shown fighting right alongside Blackhawk in a hand- to-hand melee. Despite this, he's long portrayed as essentially Blackhawk's sidekick, riding along in Blackhawk's plane as opposed to piloting his own and often brandishing a cleaver in battle. In 1952, it's firmly stated that he's a full member of the team, and from 1955 to 1964, he slowly transforms into a more realistically drawn character, changes that culminate when the Blackhawks take on a major uniform change for the first time in their history and Chop- Chop finally joins them in his choice of wardrobe. When the team later reverts to their traditional blue and black uniforms, he dons one for the first time. When the 1980s World War II-set revival of the series begins, Chop-Chop is again shown in a variation of his original outfit (and even clutches a cleaver on the cover of the first issue). It's quickly apparent, however, that the similarities end there and that he's far from comic relief. As the run progresses, it's revealed that he feels slighted by his teammates, not given proper enough respect to even wear the same uniform as them. Realizing their embarrassing oversight, they bestow to him with great ceremony a standard uniform and his own plane to mark him as a respected member of the group. After DC Comics' company-wide crossover event Crisis on Infinite Earths revamped and streamlined many of DC's properties, Chop-Chop has almost exclusively been depicted wearing the Blackhawks' standard uniform. His past likeness and role as sidekick is addressed, shown as a character in a comic book about the Blackhawks. Chop-Chop is given a proper name and uniform. Art by Dan Spiegle. 1983 controversy In Blackhawk #263 (October 1983), writer Mark Evanier took over the \\"Blackhawk Bylines\\" letter column to address an anonymous editorial written by a staff member of the Richmond Times- Dispatch that ran in the paper's February 6, 1983, edition. Evanier wrote of the piece: An admittedly stunned Evanier readily denounced the column, challenging the editorial writer's assertion that Steven Spielberg, at the time rumored to be interested in making a Blackhawk film, should be faithful to the original depiction of Chop-Chop. Evanier wrote that it's amazing to him that \\"anyone could believe that Chinese folks were really obese and stupid in the forties\\" or that Spielberg would ignore the box office and \\"commit professional suicide by so depicting them\\". When asked later if the editorial hastened Evanier's own approach to evolving the character, Evanier said he thought he would have pursued the same course regardless, giving the editorial \\"probably more attention than it deserved\\". Aircraft=Grumman XF5F Skyrocket The Grumman XF5F Skyrocket is the twin-engine fighter most identified with the Blackhawks. The team is nearly always shown flying modified versions of the plane during their World War II adventures and for some time thereafter. As Will Eisner remembered: Other notable aircraft Additionally, other planes made appearances during the course of strip: * PZL.50A JastrzƒÖb ‚Äì This is the plane that Blackhawk flew in Poland during the Nazi invasion of 1939. * Republic F-84 Thunderjet ‚Äì By the early 1950s, the Blackhawks converted the squadron to jets. This was the Blackhawk Squadron's first jet aircraft: * Lockheed XF-90 ‚Äì This actual experimental fighter was adapted to become the fictional: : F-90 \\"B\\" ‚Äì The Blackhawks flew this plane from 1950 to 1955. : F-90 \\"C\\" ‚Äì The Blackhawks were flying this model by 1957. * Republic F-105 Thunderchief ‚Äì The Blackhawks modified this plane to have VTOL capability. * Lockheed F-94 Starfire ‚Äì This is the plane that Lady Blackhawk flew. International incarnations The Blackhawk concept and characters proved to be popular on the international market as well as in the United States. Quality Comics licensed the rights along with many of their other characters to London's Boardman Books, which used them in a series of three-color reprints from 1948 to 1954. Boardman also reprinted Blackhawk stories in their Adventure Annual series of hardcover Christmas publications. Many of the British Blackhawk reprints were repackaged by Boardman art director Denis McLoughlin, who created at least one British original Blackhawk story, as well as the illustrations for several Blackhawk text stories. After Boardman's contract lapsed, Strato Publications launched a square-bound 68-page Blackhawk series which ran for 37 issues between 1956 and 1958. Early crossover In Hit Comics #26 (February 1943), Blackhawk participated in an early example of a crossover when fellow Quality Comics character Kid Eternity summons him to stop a mad scientist. Other versions=Flashpoint * In the Flashpoint reality, the Blackhawk Squadron, equipped with F-35s and with Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris among its pilots, respond to attacks on New Themyscira, but are killed by Amazonian forces. In other media=Television * A 1968 \\"presentation drawing\\" from Filmation depicts a red-shirted interpretation of Blackhawk and a member of the team fighting a pack of what appears to be four aliens, while Aquaman watches from the foreground. Created during the height of popularity of Filmation's \\"Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure\\", the artwork is believed to have been part of an attempt to convince CBS on the animation viability of other DC Comics properties. Justice League animated series. * The Justice League episode \\"The Savage Time\\" featured appearances by many DC World War II-era heroes, including the Blackhawks. When the Blackhawks join Superman and Hawkgirl in battle, Hawkgirl notices their logo. After Blackhawk salutes Hawkgirl, Superman comments \\"Friends of yours?\\", to which Hawkgirl responds \\"They are now\\". A lead Blackhawk (presumably Janos Prohaska/Bart Hawk) was voiced by Robert Picardo. * The Justice League Unlimited episode \\"I Am Legion\\" featured a now-elderly Chuck (voiced by Academy Award-nominee Seymour Cassel). According to Chuck, he was the only Blackhawk still living and he was married to Mairzey as the character was in the comic books. It was not revealed how the others died. The episode focused on Lex Luthor, The Key, and Doctor Polaris raiding the decommissioned Blackhawk Island in order to steal the advanced technology the Blackhawks had acquired on various missions and stored there (the only item they do steal is the Spear of Longinus). During a chase through the museum on the island, a statue or mannequin of Lady Blackhawk can be seen. In the epilogue, Hawkgirl and Chuck pay their respects at a statue memorial to the deceased team members. * The Arrow episode \\"Trust But Verify\\" featured a private security company called Blackhawk Squad Protection Group. An employee, Theodore Gaynor (played by Ben Browder), was John Diggle's (Oliver's bodyguard) former commanding officer in Afghanistan. Gaynor led a team of other Blackhawk employees in robbing armored cars, until he was killed by Oliver Queen. Other team members were Paul Knox (played by Colin Lawrence), Cavanaugh (played by Jae Lee) and Blake (played by an uncredited actor). * In the Arrow spin-off series The Flash, episode \\"Going Rogue\\", Leonard Snart and his accomplices attempt to rob an armored Blackhawk Squad Security truck, only to be stopped by The Flash. In a later episode, Blackhawk Island is mentioned to be within Central City limits. Film * Blackhawk is a 15-part 1952 film serial based on the comic book, produced by Sam Katzman and starring Kirk Alyn as Blackhawk. Alyn had earlier been the first screen Superman. * The Blackhawk squadron appears in the animated DVD movie Justice League: The New Frontier, but the pilots are unnamed. The only spoken line is the cry \\"Hawk-a- a-a!\\" from one of the pilots, presumably Blackhawk himself. As in the comic, the squadron intervenes at a crucial point, saving Batman and Green Arrow from being annihilated by the Centre's creatures. * In April 2018, Steven Spielberg was announced to produce/direct a film adaptation of Blackhawk for Warner Bros., with the screenplay being written by David Koepp. Spielberg will co- produce the film with Kristie Macosko Krieger and Sue Kroll.https://variety.com/2018/film/news/steven-spielberg-blackhawk- dc-1202756319/http://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-blackhawk/ Radio * The Blackhawk radio series was broadcast Wednesdays at 5:30pm on ABC from September to December 1950. Michael Fitzmaurice portrayed Blackhawk. At least 16 episodes were produced.Summers, Harrison Boyd. A Thirty-Year History of Programs Carried on National Radio Networks in the United States, 1926‚Äì1956. Columbus, Ohio: Ohio State University, 1958. Reprinted by Arno Press, 1971. Comics * Alan Moore's Top 10: The Forty-Niners features the Blackhawks-themed Skysharks as a major protagonist, detailing the origins of the science-hero city of Neopolis and the first officers of Top 10 police precinct. Moore previously used former Charlton Comics characters acquired by DC and renamed in Watchmen. Novel * A novel titled Blackhawk, by William Rotsler, was published in 1982, detailing the team's origin. Toys * A limited-edition Blackhawk G.I. Joe action figure was produced in 2002 by Dreams & Visions, licensed by DC Comics and Hasbro. The figure wore the classic blue-black flight uniform from World War II with two additional outfits and accessory sets included: Blackhawk's red and green uniform from the mid to late 1960s, and an Arctic survival uniform in sky blue. * In July 2006 DC Direct released a 6.58\\" Blackhawk action figure as part of the Series 1 DC: The New Frontier toyline. * In 2009, Mattel released a Blackhawk figure that is part of their Justice League Unlimited toyline. * In 2008, three Blackhawk figures were released for the Heroclix game from Wizkids / NECA. These represent Blackhawk himself, Stanislaus and Hendrickson. All have the standard blue and black squadron uniforms, although only Blackhawk has the hat. Blackhawk and Hendrickson are armed with assault rifles, while Stanislaus is armed with a service revolver. Blackhawk's base has a red edge (Veteran), Hendrickson's has a blue edge (Experienced), and Stanislaus' has a yellow edge (Rookie). All three, not surprisingly, have the \\"Soldier\\" keyword, and Blackhawk himself also has the \\"Leadership\\" ability. All three figures have the word Blackhawk on the base.

It was made up of squadrons and personnel from the RAF, the air forces of the British Commonwealth and exiles from German-occupied Europe. Renamed as British Air Forces of Occupation in 1945, 2TAF was recreated in 1951 and became Royal Air Force Germany in 1959. Formation Air Marshal Sir Arthur \\"Mary\\" Coningham, second commander of the Second TAF, pictured in Italy shortly before assuming command of the force, (January 1944) 2TAF was formed on 1 June 1943 as HQ Tactical Air Force from Army Co-operation Command, in connection with preparations then in train to invade Europe a year later. It took units from both Fighter Command and Bomber Command in order to form a force capable of supporting the Army in the field. Bomber Command provided No. 2 Group with light bombers; Fighter Command was split into the Air Defence of Great Britain, retaining fighter units for home defence, and No. 83 Group and No. 84 Group operating aircraft, and No. 85 Group controlling ground-based units, for the Second Tactical Air Force. In addition, No. 38 Group for towing assault gliders and No. 140 Squadron, providing strategic photo-reconnaissance, were also part of the tactical air force at its inception.Royal Air Force, RAF Narrative on the Liberation of North West Europe (Maxwell AFB, Ala.: AFHRA, USAF Collection, call no. 512.041-38 vol. 1, IRIS no. 00895753, 1946), 8.  Second World War  2TAF's first commander was Air Marshal Sir John d'Albiac, who, on 21 January 1944, was succeeded by the man most associated with Second TAF, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham. Coningham had great experience of the type of operations required for supporting fast moving ground warfare due to his command of the Desert Air Force in North Africa and Italy. He honed Second TAF into a command up to the challenges presented to it, and incorporated many of the lessons from Italy, including the use of the \\"cab rank\\" system for aircraft for close air support, into the doctrine of Second TAF. Geoffrey Page, commander of 125 Wing of the Second TAF, about to take off on a sortie from Longues-sur-Mer, Normandy, in a Spitfire IX, (June 1944) The 34th Reconnaissance Wing, commanded by Royal Navy Commodore E.C. Thornton, served as the air spotting pool for naval gunfire support throughout Operation Overlord. The wing included No. 2 Squadron RAF, No. 26 Squadron RAF, No. 63 Squadron RAF, No. 268 Squadron RAF, No. 414 Squadron RCAF, 808 Naval Air Squadron, 885 Naval Air Squadron, 886 Naval Air Squadron, 897 Naval Air Squadron, and (briefly) United States Navy VOS-7. By this late stage in the war, the Luftwaffe was but a pale shadow of the organisation it had once been. Mostly Second TAF spent its time supporting the British and Canadian forces on the left flank of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force's command. One notable exception was the last great attack of the Luftwaffe, Operation Bodenplatte, mounted on New Year's Day 1945, when the Second TAF suffered serious losses on the ground. On 20 January 1945, four Gloster Meteors jets from 616 Squadron were moved to Melsbroek in Belgium and attached to the Second Tactical Air Force. In February 1945 No. 87 Group RAF was established, a transport formation. It became part of 2nd TAF/BAFO, but was reduced to No. 87 Wing RAF on 15 July 1946.  Post Second World War  The Second TAF was renamed as the British Air Forces of Occupation on 15 July 1945. It began as a large force of four groups (2, 83, 84, 85 Groups) but No. 2 Group disbanded on 1 May 1947. By the end of 1947, the forces had shrunk to ten squadrons at three airfields, all directly under control of the Air Headquarters at Bad Eilsen.Group Captain W J Taylor OBE, Historical Background, The RAF in Germany 1945-1993 In 1951, the British Air Forces of Occupation reverted to their former name with the re-creation of the Second Tactical Air Force on 1 September 1951. No. 2 Group was transferred again to Second Tactical Air Force on 1 September 1951, but was disbanded on 15 November 1958. No. 83 Group RAF controlled 2TAF's southern area from 1952 to 1958. On 1 July 1956, No. 2 Group appeared to encompass wings at Ahlhorn (No. 125 Wing RAF), RAF Fassberg (No. 121 Wing RAF), Gutersloh (No. 551 Wing RAF, under the control of Bomber Command), Jever (No. 122 Wing RAF), Laarbruch (No. 34 Wing RAF), RAF Oldenburg (No. 124 Wing RAF), and RAF Wunstorf (No. 123 Wing RAF), while No. 83 Group directed wings at RAF Bruggen, Celle, RAF Geilenkichen, RAF Wahn, and RAF Wildenrath.http://www.laarbruch-museum.net/ENG/Squadrons/second_taf.htm The Second Tactical Air Force was redesignated Royal Air Force Germany on 1 January 1959, at which point C.-in-C.

If and are normed vector spaces (a special type of TVS), then is bounded if and only if there exists some such that for all in , :. The smallest such , denoted by , is called the operator norm of . A linear operator that is sequentially continuous or continuous is a bounded operator and moreover, a linear operator between normed spaces is bounded if and only if it is continuous. However, a bounded linear operator between more general topological vector spaces is not necessarily continuous.  In topological vector spaces  A linear operator between two topological vector spaces (TVSs) is locally bounded or just bounded if whenever is bounded in then is bounded in . A subset of a TVS is called bounded (or more precisely, von Neumann bounded) if every neighborhood of the origin absorbs it. In a normed space (and even in a seminormed space), a subset is von Neumann bounded if and only if it is norm bounded. Hence, for normed spaces, the notion of a von Neumann bounded set is identical to the usual notion of a norm-bounded subset. Every sequentially continuous linear operator between TVS is a bounded operator. This implies that every continuous linear operator is bounded. However, in general, a bounded linear operator between two TVSs need not be continuous. This formulation allows one to define bounded operators between general topological vector spaces as an operator which takes bounded sets to bounded sets. In this context, it is still true that every continuous map is bounded, however the converse fails; a bounded operator need not be continuous. Clearly, this also means that boundedness is no longer equivalent to Lipschitz continuity in this context. If the domain is a bornological space (e.g. a pseudometrizable TVS, a Fr√©chet space, a normed space) then a linear operators into any other locally convex spaces is bounded if and only if it is continuous. For LF spaces, a weaker converse holds; any bounded linear map from an LF space is sequentially continuous.  Bornological spaces  Bornological spaces are exactly those locally convex spaces for every bounded linear operator into another locally convex space is necessarily bounded. That is, a locally convex TVS is a bornological space if and only if for every locally convex TVS , a linear operator is continuous if and only if it is bounded. Every normed space is bornological.  Characterizations of bounded linear operators  Let be a linear operator between TVSs (not necessarily Hausdorff). The following are equivalent: 1. is (locally) bounded; 2. (Definition): maps bounded subsets of its domain to bounded subsets of its codomain; 3. maps bounded subsets of its domain to bounded subsets of its image ; 4. maps null sequences to bounded sequences; * A null sequence is a sequence that converges to the origin. * Thus any linear map that is sequentially continuous at the origin is bounded. and if and are locally convex then we can add to this list: 5. maps bounded disks into bounded disks. 6. maps bornivorous disks in into bornivorous disks in . and if is a bornological space and is locally convex then we can add to this list: 7. is sequentially continuous.  Bounded linear operators between normed spaces  A bounded linear operator is generally not a bounded function, as generally one can find a sequence in such that \\\\Lx_k\\\\_Y \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. Instead, all that is required for the operator to be bounded is that :\\\\frac{\\\\Lx\\\\_Y}{\\\\x\\\\_X} \\\\le M < \\\\infty for all . So, the operator could only be a bounded function if it satisfied L(x) = 0 for all x, as is easy to understand by considering that for a linear operator, L(ax) = aL(x) for all scalars . Rather, a bounded linear operator is a locally bounded function. A linear operator between normed spaces is bounded if and only if it is continuous, and by linearity, if and only if it is continuous at zero.  Equivalence of boundedness and continuity  As stated in the introduction, a linear operator between normed spaces and is bounded if and only if it is a continuous linear operator. The proof is as follows. Suppose that is bounded. Then, for all vectors with nonzero we have :\\\\L(x + h) - L(x)\\\\ = \\\\L(h)\\\\ \\\\le M\\\\h\\\\. \\\\, Letting \\\\mathit{h} \\\\, go to zero shows that is continuous at . Moreover, since the constant does not depend on , this shows that in fact is uniformly continuous, and even Lipschitz continuous. Conversely, it follows from the continuity at the zero vector that there exists a \\\\delta > 0 such that \\\\L(h)\\\\=\\\\ L(h) - L(0) \\\\ \\\\le 1 for all vectors with \\\\h\\\\ \\\\le \\\\delta. Thus, for all non-zero , one has :\\\\Lx\\\\ = \\\\left \\\\Vert {\\\\x\\\\ \\\\over \\\\delta} L \\\\left( \\\\delta {x \\\\over \\\\x\\\\} \\\\right) \\\\right \\\\Vert = {\\\\x\\\\ \\\\over \\\\delta} \\\\left \\\\Vert L \\\\left( \\\\delta {x \\\\over \\\\x\\\\} \\\\right) \\\\right \\\\Vert \\\\le {\\\\x\\\\ \\\\over \\\\delta} \\\\cdot 1 = {1 \\\\over \\\\delta}\\\\x\\\\. This proves that is bounded.  Further properties  The condition for to be bounded, namely that there exists some such that for all x :\\\\Lx\\\\ \\\\le M \\\\x\\\\,\\\\, is precisely the condition for to be Lipschitz continuous at 0 (and hence everywhere, because is linear). A common procedure for defining a bounded linear operator between two given Banach spaces is as follows. First, define a linear operator on a dense subset of its domain, such that it is locally bounded. Then, extend the operator by continuity to a continuous linear operator on the whole domain.  Examples  * Any linear operator between two finite-dimensional normed spaces is bounded, and such an operator may be viewed as multiplication by some fixed matrix. * Any linear operator defined on a finite-dimensional normed space is bounded. * On the sequence space of eventually zero sequences of real numbers, considered with the ‚Ñì1 norm, the linear operator to the real numbers which returns the sum of a sequence is bounded, with operator norm 1. If the same space is considered with the norm, the same operator is not bounded. * Many integral transforms are bounded linear operators. For instance, if :K:[a, b]\\\\times [c, d]\\\\to {\\\\mathbb R} \\\\, is a continuous function, then the operator defined on the space of continuous functions on endowed with the uniform norm and with values in the space with given by the formula :(Lf)(y)=\\\\int_{a}^{b}!K(x, y)f(x)\\\\,dx, \\\\, is bounded. This operator is in fact compact. The compact operators form an important class of bounded operators. * The Laplace operator :\\\\Delta:H^2({\\\\mathbb R}^n)\\\\to L^2({\\\\mathbb R}^n) \\\\, (its domain is a Sobolev space and it takes values in a space of square-integrable functions) is bounded. * The shift operator on the l2 space of all sequences (x0, x1, x2...) of real numbers with x_0^2+x_1^2+x_2^2+\\\\cdots < \\\\infty, \\\\, :L(x_0, x_1, x_2, \\\\dots)=(0, x_0, x_1, x_2,\\\\dots) \\\\, is bounded. Its operator norm is easily seen to be 1.  Unbounded linear operators  Not every linear operator between normed spaces is bounded. Let be the space of all trigonometric polynomials defined on [‚àíœÄ, œÄ], with the norm :\\\\P\\\\=\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi}!P(x)\\\\,dx. Define the operator which acts by taking the derivative, so it maps a polynomial to its derivative P‚Ä≤. Then, for :v=e^{in x} with , we have \\\\v\\\\=2\\\\pi, while \\\\L (v)\\\\=2\\\\pi n\\\\to\\\\infty as , so this operator is not bounded. It turns out that this is not a singular example, but rather part of a general rule. However, given any normed spaces and with infinite-dimensional and not being the zero space, one can find a linear operator which is not continuous from to . That such a basic operator as the derivative (and others) is not bounded makes it harder to study. If, however, one defines carefully the domain and range of the derivative operator, one may show that it is a closed operator. Closed operators are more general than bounded operators but still \\"well-behaved\\" in many ways.  Properties of the space of bounded linear operators  * The space of all bounded linear operators from to is denoted by and is a normed vector space. * If is Banach, then so is . * from which it follows that dual spaces are Banach. * For any , the kernel of is a closed linear subspace of . * If is Banach and is nontrivial, then is Banach.

In essence, it is a connection between the algebraic and topological sides of operator theory. The formal statement of the theorem is as follows: :Von Neumann Bicommutant Theorem. Let be an algebra consisting of bounded operators on a Hilbert space , containing the identity operator, and closed under taking adjoints. Then the closures of in the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology are equal, and are in turn equal to the bicommutant of . This algebra is called the von Neumann algebra generated by . There are several other topologies on the space of bounded operators, and one can ask what are the *-algebras closed in these topologies. If is closed in the norm topology then it is a C*-algebra, but not necessarily a von Neumann algebra. One such example is the C*-algebra of compact operators (on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space). For most other common topologies the closed *-algebras containing 1 are von Neumann algebras; this applies in particular to the weak operator, strong operator, *-strong operator, ultraweak, ultrastrong, and *-ultrastrong topologies. It is related to the Jacobson density theorem.  Proof  Let be a Hilbert space and the bounded operators on . Consider a self-adjoint unital subalgebra of (this means that contains the adjoints of its members, and the identity operator on ). The theorem is equivalent to the combination of the following three statements: :(i) :(ii) :(iii) where the and subscripts stand for closures in the weak and strong operator topologies, respectively. Proof of (i) By definition of the weak operator topology, for any and in , the map T ‚Üí is continuous in this topology. Therefore, for any operator (and by substituting once and once ), so is the map :T \\\\to \\\\langle Tx, O^*y\\\\rangle - \\\\langle TOx, y\\\\rangle = \\\\langle OTx, y\\\\rangle - \\\\langle TOx, y\\\\rangle. Let S be any subset of , and S‚Ä≤ its commutant. For any operator not in S‚Ä≤, \\\\- is nonzero for some O in S and some x and y in . By the continuity of the abovementioned mapping, there is an open neighborhood of in the weak operator topology for which this is nonzero, therefore this open neighborhood is also not in S‚Ä≤. Thus S‚Ä≤ is closed in the weak operator, i.e. S‚Ä≤ is weakly closed. Thus every commutant is weakly closed, and so is ; since it contains , it also contains its weak closure. Proof of (ii) This follows directly from the weak operator topology being coarser than the strong operator topology: for every point in , every open neighborhood of in the weak operator topology is also open in the strong operator topology and therefore contains a member of ; therefore is also a member of . Proof of (iii) Fix . We will show . Fix an open neighborhood of in the strong operator topology. By definition of the strong operator topology, U contains a finite intersection U(h1,Œµ1) ‚à©...‚à©U(hn,Œµn) of subbasic open sets of the form U(h,Œµ) = {O ‚àà L(H): Oh - Xh < Œµ}, where h is in H and Œµ > 0. Fix h in . Consider the closure of } with respect to the norm of H and equipped with the inner product of H. It is a Hilbert space (being a closed subspace of a Hilbert space ), and so has a corresponding orthogonal projection which we denote . is bounded, so it is in . Next we prove: :Lemma. . :Proof. Fix . Then , so it is the limit of a sequence with in for all . Then for all , is also in and thus its limit is in . By continuity of (since it is in and thus Lipschitz continuous), this limit is . Since , PTPx = TPx. From this it follows that PTP = TP for all in . :By using the closure of under the adjoint we further have, for every in and all : ::\\\\langle x,TPy\\\\rangle = \\\\langle x,PTPy\\\\rangle = \\\\langle Px,TPy\\\\rangle = \\\\langle T^*Px,Py\\\\rangle = \\\\langle PT^*Px,y\\\\rangle = \\\\langle T^*Px,y\\\\rangle = \\\\langle Px,Ty\\\\rangle = \\\\langle x,PTy\\\\rangle :thus TP = PT and P lies in . By definition of the bicommutant XP = PX. Since is unital, , hence . Thus for every , there exists T in with . Then T lies in U(h,Œµ). Thus in every open neighborhood of in the strong operator topology there is a member of , and so is in the strong operator topology closure of .  Non-unital case  A C*-algebra acting on H is said to act non-degenerately if for h in , implies . In this case, it can be shown using an approximate identity in that the identity operator I lies in the strong closure of . Therefore, the conclusion of the bicommutant theorem holds for .

Leh, located in the Leh district, was also the historical capital of the Himalayan Kingdom of Ladakh, the seat of which was in the Leh Palace, the former residence of the royal family of Ladakh, built in the same style and about the same time as the Potala Palace in Tibet. Leh is at an altitude of 3,524 metres (11,562 ft), and is connected via National Highway 1 to Srinagar in the southwest and to Manali in the south via the Leh-Manali Highway. History People of Leh with traditional dress Leh was an important stopover on trade routes along the Indus Valley between Tibet to the east, Kashmir to the west and also between India and China for centuries. The main goods carried were salt, grain, pashm or cashmere wool, charas or cannabis resin from the Tarim Basin, indigo, silk yarn and Banaras brocade. Although there are a few indications that the Chinese knew of a trade route through Ladakh to India as early as the Kushan period (1st to 3rd centuries CE),Hill (2009), pp. 200-204. and certainly by Tang dynasty,Francke (1977 edition), pp. 76-78 little is actually known of the history of the region before the formation of the kingdom towards the end of the 10th century by the Tibetan prince, Skyid lde nyima gon (or Nyima gon), a grandson of the anti-Buddhist Tibetan king, Langdarma (r. c. 838 to 841). He conquered Western Tibet although his army originally numbered only 300 men. Several towns and castles are said to have been founded by Nyima gon and he apparently ordered the construction of the main sculptures at Shey. \\"In an inscription, he says he had them made for the religious benefit of the Tsanpo (the dynastical name of his father and ancestors), and of all the people of Ngaris (Western Tibet). This shows that already in this generation Langdarma's opposition to Buddhism had disappeared.\\"Francke (1914), pp. 89-90. Shey, just 15 km east of modern Leh, was the ancient seat of the Ladakhi kings. During the reign of Delegs Namgyal (1660‚Äì1685),Francke (1977 edition), p. 20. the Nawab of Kashmir, which was then a province in the Mughal Empire, arranged for the Mongol army to temporarily leave Ladakh, though it returned later. As payment for assisting Delegs Namgyal in the Tibet-Ladakh-Mughal war of 1679‚Äì1684, the Nawab made a number of onerous demands. One of the least was to build a large Sunni Muslim mosque in Leh at the upper end of the bazaar in Leh, below the Leh Palace. The mosque reflects a mixture of Islamic and Tibetan architecture and can accommodate more than 500 people. This was apparently not the first mosque in Leh; there are two smaller ones which are said to be older.Francke (1977 edition), pp. 120-123. Several trade routes have traditionally converged on Leh, from all four directions. The most direct route was the one the modern highway follows from the Punjab via Mandi, the Kulu valley, over the Rohtang Pass, through Lahaul and on to the Indus Valley, and then downriver to Leh. The route from Srinagar was roughly the same as the road that today crosses the Zoji La (pass) to Kargil, and then up the Indus Valley to Leh. From Baltistan there were two difficult routes: the main on ran up the Shyok Valley from the Indus, over a pass and then down the Hanu River to the Indus again below Khalsi (Khalatse). The other ran from Skardu straight up the Indus to Kargil and on to Leh. Then, there were both the summer and winter routes from Leh to Yarkand via the Karakoram Pass and Xaidulla. Finally, there were a couple of possible routes from Leh to Lhasa.Rizvi (1996), pp. 109-111. The first recorded royal residence in Ladakh, built at the top of the high Namgyal ('Victory') Peak overlooking the present palace and town, is the now-ruined fort and the gon-khang (Temple of the Guardian Divinities) built by King Tashi Namgyal. Tashi Namgyal is known to have ruled during the final quarter of the 16th century CE.Rizvi (1996), p. 64. The Namgyal (also called \\"Tsemo Gompa\\" = 'Red Gompa', or dGon-pa-so-ma = 'New Monastery'),Francke (1914), p. 70. a temple, is the main Buddhist centre in Leh.Rizvi (1996), pp. 41, 64, 225-226. There are some older walls of fortifications behind it which Francke reported used to be known as the \\"Dard Castle.\\" If it was indeed built by Dards, it must pre-date the establishment of Tibetan rulers in Ladakh over a thousand years ago.Rizvi (1996), pp. 226-227. Below this are the Chamba (Byams-pa, i.e., Maitreya) and Chenresi (sPyan-ras-gzigs, i.e. Avalokiteshvara) monasteries which are of uncertain date. The royal palace, known as Leh Palace, was built by King Sengge Namgyal (1612‚Äì1642), presumably between the period when the Portuguese Jesuit priest, Francisco de Azevedo, visited Leh in 1631, and made no mention of it, and Sengge Namgyal's death in 1642.Rizvi (1996), pp. 69, 290. The Leh Palace is nine storeys high; the upper floors accommodated the royal family, and the stables and storerooms are located on the lower floors. The palace was abandoned when Kashmiri forces besieged it in the mid-19th century. The royal family moved their premises south to their current home in Stok Palace on the southern bank of the Indus. :\\"As has already been mentioned, the original name of the town is not sLel, as it is nowadays spelled, but sLes, which signifies an encampment of nomads. These [Tibetan] nomads were probably in the habit of visiting the Leh valley at a time when it had begun to be irrigated by Dard colonisers. Thus, the most ancient part of the ruins on the top of rNam-rgyal-rtse-mo hill at Leh are called 'aBrog-pal-mkhar (Dard castle). . . . \\"Francke (1914), p. 68. See also, ibid, p. 45. In 2010, Leh was heavily damaged by the sudden floods caused by a cloud burst. Administration Unlike other districts in India, the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) is in charge of governance in Leh. It has 30 councillors, 4 nominated and 26 elected. The Chief Executive Councillor heads and chairs this council. . The 'Deputy Commissioner, Leh' also holds the power of 'Chief Executive Officer of the LAHDC'. The Current Deputy Commissioner of Leh district is Sachin Kumar Vaishya.  The Old Town of Leh  Leh City View from Namgyal Tsemo Monastery along with Leh Palace The old town of Leh was added to the World Monuments Fund's list of 100 most endangered sites due to increased rainfall from climate change and other reasons. Neglect and changing settlement patterns within the old town have threatened the long-term preservation of this unique site. The rapid and poorly planned urbanisation of Leh has increased the risk of flash floods in some areas, while other areas, according to research by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, suffer from the less dramatic, gradual effects of ‚Äòinvisible disasters‚Äô, which often go unreported.Local approaches to harmonising climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction: Lessons from India, Anshu Sharma, Sahba Chauhan and Sunny Kumar, the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, 2014 cdkn.org Geography Leh and its surroundings Mountains dominate the landscape around the Leh as it is at an altitude of 3,500m .The principal access roads include the 434 km Srinagar-Leh highway which connects Leh with Srinagar and the 473 km Leh-Manali Highway which connects Manali with Leh. Both roads are open only on a seasonal basis.The Journey from Kashmir Although the access roads from Srinagar and Manali are often blocked by snow in winter, the local roads in the Indus Valley usually remain open due to the low level of precipitation and snowfall. Climate Leh has a cold desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWk) with long, cold winters from late November to early March, with minimum temperatures well below freezing for most of the winter. The city gets occasional snowfall during winter. The weather in the remaining months is generally fine and warm during the day. Average annual rainfall is only 102 mm (4.02 inches). In 2010 the city experienced flash floods which killed more than 100 people. Agriculture A view of agriculture around Leh. Leh is located at an average elevation of about 3500 metres, which means that only one crop a year can be grown there, while two can be grown at Khalatse. By the time crops are being sown at Leh in late May, they are already half-grown at Khalatse. The main crop is grim (naked barley - Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum Hook. f., which is an ancient form of domesticated barley with an easier to remove hull) - from which tsampa, the staple food in Ladakh, is made.Rizvi (1996), p. 38. The water for agriculture of Ladakh comes from the Indus, which runs low in March and April when barley-fields have the greatest need for irrigation. Demographics People of Leh As of 2001 India census, Leh town had a population of 27,513. Males constitute 61% of the population and females 39%, due to a large presence of non-local labourers, traders and government employees. Leh has an average literacy rate of 75%, close to the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 82.14%, and female literacy is 65.46%. In Leh, 9% of the population is under 6 years of age. The people of Leh are ethnic Tibetan, speaking Ladakhi, a Tibetic language. The Muslim presence dates back to the annexation of Ladakh by Kashmir, after the Fifth Dalai Lama attempted to invade Ladakh from Tibet. Since then, there has been further migration from the Kashmir Valley due firstly to trade and latterly with the transfer of tourism from the Kashmir Valley to Ladakh. Ladakh receives very large numbers of tourists for its size. In 2010, 77,800 tourists arrived in Leh. Numbers of visitors have swelled rapidly in recent years, increasing 77% in the 5 years to 2010. This growth is largely accounted for by larger numbers of trips by domestic Indian travellers. ReligionCoexistence with religions other than Buddhism= Leh mosque and palace Hinduism is the oldest religion in the valley, having the second largest number of followers after Buddhism. Since the 8th-century people belonging to different religions, particularly Buddhism and Islam, have been living in Leh. They co-inhabited the region from the time of early period of Namgyal dynasty and there are no records of any conflict between them. > \\"This mosque was built by Ibraheem Khan (in the mid 17th century),A History > of Ladakh.

Translated by Captain Henderson. Calcutta, 1872, p. 12. In recent times, relations between the Buddhist and Muslim communities soured due to political conflicts. Besides these two communities there are people living in the region who belong to other religions such as Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism. The small Christian community in Leh are descendants of converts from Tibetan Buddhism by German Moravian missionaries who established a church at Keylong in Lahaul in the 1860s, and were allowed to open another mission in Leh in 1885 and had a sub-branch in Khalatse. They stayed open until Indian Independence in 1947. In spite of their successful medical and educational activities, they made only a few converts.Rizvi (1996), p. 212. Every year Sindhu Darshan Festival is held at Shey, 15 km away from town to promote religious harmony and glory of Indus (Sindhu) river.

The National Highway 1D from Srinagar via Kargil is generally open longer. The Leh-Manali Highway can be troublesome due to very high passes and plateaus, and the lower but landslide-prone Rohtang Pass near Manali. The third road axis is under construction. *National Highway 1 The overland approach to Ladakh from the Kashmir valley via the 434-km. National Highway 1 typically remains open for traffic from June to October/November. The most dramatic part of this road journey is the ascent up the 3,505 m (11,500 ft.) high Zoji-la, a tortuous pass in the Great Himalayan Wall. The Jammu and Kashmir State Road Transport Corporation (JKSRTC) operates regular Deluxe and Ordinary bus services between Srinagar and Leh on this route with an overnight halt at Kargil. Taxis (cars and jeeps) are also available at Srinagar for the journey. *National Highway 3 or Leh-Manali Highway Since 1989, the 473-km Leh-Manali Highway has been serving as the second land approach to Ladakh. Open for traffic from June to late October, this high road traverses the upland desert plateaux of Rupsho whose altitude ranges from 3,660 m to 4,570 m. There are a number of high passes en route among which the highest one, known as Tanglang La, is sometimes (but incorrectly) claimed to be the world's second highest motorable pass at an altitude of 5,325 m. (17,469 feet). See the article on Khardung La for a discussion of the world's highest motorable passes. * Nimmu‚ÄìPadam‚ÄìDarcha road This is the third road axis to Leh. It is currently under construction. *Air Leh Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport Leh's Leh Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport has flights to Delhi at least daily on Air India which also provides twice weekly services to Jammu and a weekly flight to Srinagar. Passengers connect in Delhi for other destinations. Go Air operates Delhi to Leh daily flights during peak time. *Rail There is no railway service currently in Ladakh, however 2 railway routes are proposed- the Bilaspur‚ÄìLeh line and Srinagar‚ÄìKargil‚ÄìLeh line for more information. Media and communications State-owned All India Radio Leh has a local station in Leh, which transmits various programs of mass interest.

The results obtained in the study of operator algebras are phrased in algebraic terms, while the techniques used are highly analytic.Theory of Operator Algebras I By Masamichi Takesaki, Springer 2012, p vi Although the study of operator algebras is usually classified as a branch of functional analysis, it has direct applications to representation theory, differential geometry, quantum statistical mechanics, quantum information, and quantum field theory. Overview Operator algebras can be used to study arbitrary sets of operators with little algebraic relation simultaneously. From this point of view, operator algebras can be regarded as a generalization of spectral theory of a single operator. In general operator algebras are non-commutative rings. An operator algebra is typically required to be closed in a specified operator topology inside the algebra of the whole continuous linear operators. In particular, it is a set of operators with both algebraic and topological closure properties. In some disciplines such properties are axiomized and algebras with certain topological structure become the subject of the research. Though algebras of operators are studied in various contexts (for example, algebras of pseudo-differential operators acting on spaces of distributions), the term operator algebra is usually used in reference to algebras of bounded operators on a Banach space or, even more specially in reference to algebras of operators on a separable Hilbert space, endowed with the operator norm topology. In the case of operators on a Hilbert space, the Hermitian adjoint map on operators gives a natural involution which provides an additional algebraic structure which can be imposed on the algebra. In this context, the best studied examples are self-adjoint operator algebras, meaning that they are closed under taking adjoints. These include C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras. C*-algebras can be easily characterized abstractly by a condition relating the norm, involution and multiplication. Such abstractly defined C*-algebras can be identified to a certain closed subalgebra of the algebra of the continuous linear operators on a suitable Hilbert space. A similar result holds for von Neumann algebras. Commutative self-adjoint operator algebras can be regarded as the algebra of complex valued continuous functions on a locally compact space, or that of measurable functions on a standard measurable space. Thus, general operator algebras are often regarded as a noncommutative generalizations of these algebras, or the structure of the base space on which the functions are defined. This point of view is elaborated as the philosophy of noncommutative geometry, which tries to study various non-classical and/or pathological objects by noncommutative operator algebras. Examples of operator algebras which are not self-adjoint include: *nest algebras *many commutative subspace lattice algebras *many limit algebras See also *Banach algebra *Topologies on the set of operators on a Hilbert space *Matrix mechanics *Vertex operator algebra References Further reading  * * M.

Built by Pratt & Whitney, they were designed for the Boeing 757. As a 757 powerplant, these engines compete with the Rolls-Royce RB211. Design and development Pratt & Whitney began working on the JT10D in October 1971 intended for the McDonnell Douglas YC-15 into the Advanced Medium STOL Transport project and the Boeing 767 then code named 7X7, which first ran in August 1974. In December 1980, Pratt & Whitney changed to a new naming system for its engines and the JT10D became the PW2037. The PW2000 is a dual-spool, axial air flow, annular combustion, high bypass turbofan with a dual-channel Full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. It was certified in 1984 as the first civilian FADEC- controlled aviation engine. MTU Aero Engines holds a 21.2% stake in the engine, having developed the low-pressure turbine and turbine exit casing as well as producing critical parts of the low-pressure turbine, the turbine exhaust casing, high-pressure compressor and high-pressure turbine components. The first PW2000 series engine, the PW2037, powered the Boeing 757-200 and entered service with Delta Air Lines as the launch customer for the civil aviation version of the engine. C-17 Globemaster III during a post-flight inspection Other than the 757, the PW2000 series engines also power the C-17 Globemaster III military transport; the United States Department of Defense designation for the engine is F117, with the specific variant used on the C-17 being the F117-PW-100. The powerplant first flew on the C-17 in 1991. The PW2000 also powered the abortive Ilyushin Il-96M; the engine first flew on the Il-96M in 1993. On October 16, 2008 the NTSB recommended that the FAA issue urgent new inspection procedures on the PW2037 model of the engine, following an uncontained turbine failure event in August 2008.

Her keel was laid down on 1 April 1942 at Mare Island, California, by the Mare Island Navy Yard. She was launched on 11 November 1942 sponsored by Mrs. Kenneth C. Hurd; and commissioned on 15 February 1943, Commander Charles F. Brindupke in command. Tullibee held shakedown training from 8‚Äì30 April 1943 and departed for Hawaii on 8 May. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 15 May and held further training exercises in Hawaiian waters. Numerous air fitting leaks developed, and she was docked for repairs twice. When this proved ineffective, the submarine entered the navy yard until 11 July. Tullibee started her first war patrol on 19 July 1943. She was sunk by one of her own torpedoes on 26 March 1944 while on her fourth patrol. One crew member survived the sinking of Tullibee. First war patrol On 19 July, Tullibee got under way for the Western Caroline Islands and her first war patrol. On 28 July, she sighted a passenger-cargo ship, accompanied by an escort and an aircraft that prevented her attack. On 5 August, the submarine began patrolling the Saipan-Truk traffic lanes. Five days later, she sighted smoke on the horizon that proved to be three freighters with an escort. Tullibee closed the range to ; launched one torpedo at the ship on the right and three at the vessel on the left. As the submarine fired the first torpedo, a ship rammed her and bent her number one periscope. She went deep and was depth charged by the escort as the ships sped away. As the torpedoes had been set to run at a depth of ‚Äî too deep for the draft of the largest target ‚Äî none of the torpedoes exploded. On 14 August, Tullibee sighted a convoy of three freighters with an escort and began an end-around run to get into good attack position. She launched a torpedo from a range of and went deep. It missed, and she returned to periscope depth to fire three torpedoes at the last ship. It apparently saw their wakes as it turned and combed them. The submarine again went deep. When she surfaced, the targets had escaped. On 22 August, Tullibee sighted a convoy of five ships escorted by two destroyers; closed to ; and launched three torpedoes at the nearest freighter. Two minutes later, she fired three more at another ship. As she went deep to avoid a destroyer heading her way, she heard one explosion. She soon heard the bursts of two more torpedo explosions, followed by breaking up noises. When she surfaced, she sighted over 1000 empty oil drums, but no ships. Postwar examination of Japanese records indicated that Tullibee had damaged one freighter and had sunk the passenger-cargo ship Kaisho Maru. The patrol terminated when the submarine reached Midway Island on 6 September. Second war patrol On 28 September, Tullibee began her second war patrol. Her assigned area was in the East China Sea between the Ryukyu Islands and the China coast. On 4 October, she sighted a convoy of nine passenger-cargo ships with three destroyer escorts. The submarine pulled well ahead of the convoy and tracked them until the next morning. At 00:58, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a large freighter, with one hitting the target a minute later. Another spread of three from the bow tubes produced two hits on a heavily laden cargo ship. Minor explosions and breaking up noises began immediately as Chicago Maru sank. Twelve days later, Tullibee contacted a convoy of seven ships with three escorts that later separated into two groups; one hugging the China coast and the other heading for Pescadores Channel. She attacked the largest ship in the latter group with six torpedoes; one hit the target. The submarine began an end-around run and launched four torpedoes at another ship. Two torpedoes soon broached, and Tullibee broke off the attack. She went deep and rigged for silent running to evade the escorts. On 5 November, the submarine was running submerged near Okinoyerabu Shima when she sighted a large, three-story building on the island. She surfaced and fired 55 shells into the barracks before retiring at full speed. She began the voyage back to Hawaii the next day and reached Pearl Harbor, via Midway Island, on 16 November. Her official score for this patrol was one passenger-cargo ship sunk, a tanker damaged, and a passenger-cargo ship damaged. Third war patrol Tullibees third patrol was in a \\"wolfpack\\" with sister ships and . The trio sortied from Pearl Harbor on 14 December 1943 for the Mariana Islands to intercept enemy shipping plying between Truk and Japan. On 2 January 1944, Tullibee sighted a Japanese on the surface and launched four torpedoes at a range of . The enemy saw the wakes and combed the four of them as Tullibee was forced deep by an enemy floatplane that dropped six bombs. On 19 January, Haddock reported that she had damaged the Japanese escort carrier , which limped to Saipan. Tullibee sighted the carrier there on 25 January, close ashore and well protected by escorts and aircraft. The submarine remained on station for several days awaiting an opportunity to sink the aircraft carrier. However, when she surfaced on 28 January, she learned that the carrier had slipped away. Three days later, the submarine made radar contact with two targets. She launched three torpedoes at what appeared to be a freighter and swung left to fire one at the escort. The first target, net tender Hiro Maru, took two hits and disintegrated in about one minute. The torpedo fired at the escort missed, and the submarine went deep to evade. Tullibee cleared the area the following day and returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 February. Fourth war patrol and loss On 5 March, Tullibee stood out of Pearl Harbor to begin her fourth war patrol. Nine days later, she called at Midway Island to top off her fuel and then proceeded to her patrol area in the Palau Islands. She was scheduled to support aircraft carrier strikes against those islands on 30‚Äì31 March. On 25 March, Tullibee arrived on station and began patrolling. The next day, off the Palau Islands she made radar contact on a convoy consisting of a large passenger-cargo ship, two medium-sized freighters, a destroyer, and two other escorts. The submarine made several surface runs on the transport but kept losing her in rain squalls. Tullibee finally closed to and launched two torpedoes from her bow tubes at the target. About two minutes later, the submarine was rocked by a violent explosion. It was only learned after the war that Tullibees torpedo had run a circular course and she had sunk herself. Gunner's Mate C.W. Kuykendall, on the bridge at the time, was knocked unconscious and thrown into the water. When he regained consciousness, the submarine was gone. He heard voices in the water for about ten minutes before they stopped. The next day, he was picked up by Japanese destroyer Wakatake. Kuykendall survived as a prisoner of war and was released after V-J Day. Tullibee received three battle stars for World War II service. Tullibee was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 July 1944.

Her keel was laid down on March 6, 1942 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on July 20, 1942 sponsored by Miss Katherine Eugenia McKee, and commissioned on September 18, 1942 with Commander W.G. Ebert in command. First and second war patrols On January 19, 1943, after training out of New London, Connecticut, Scamp set course for Pearl Harbor, via the Panama Canal. She arrived in Hawaii on February 13, 1943 and commenced final training in the local operating area. Scamp began her first war patrol on March 1, 1943. She stopped at Midway Island on March 5, debarked her passenger, Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, Jr. Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, fueled, and then, headed for the coast of Honsh≈´. Her first two attacks on the enemy were doomed to failure by the faulty magnetic detonators in her torpedoes. After the inactivating of the magnetic features on her remaining torpedoes, Scamp scored two hits, one on an unidentified target on the night of March 20 and the other damaged Manju Maru early the next morning. The submarine stopped at Midway Island again on March 26 and returned to Pearl Harbor on April 7. Scamp put to sea again on April 19, bound for the Southwest Pacific. She took on fuel at Johnston Island then slipped between the Marshall Islands and the Gilbert Islands to reconnoiter Ocean Island and Nauru Island. This mission she completed on April 27 and 28 and then shaped a course for the Bismarck Archipelago. She had to hold fire on each of her first three enemy contacts because they were hospital ships. However, on the afternoon of May 28, she succeeded in pumping three torpedoes into the converted seaplane tender Kamikawa Maru (The Kamikawa Maru had been damaged during an attack by the USS Wahoo on May 4, 1943). She evaded the enemy escorts and came up to periscope depth to observe the results. The enemy ship was down by the stern and loading men into boats. A little after midnight, Scamp finished off her stricken adversary with two more well aimed torpedoes. She ended her second war patrol at Brisbane, Australia, on June 4, 1943. Third and fourth war patrols I-168 in March 1934 From Brisbane, she departed on her third war patrol on June 22, 1943. She patrolled a scouting line off the Solomon Islands and north to the Bismarck Sea. She passed the Shortland Islands on July 14 and, on July 27, 1943 encountered an enemy convoy. During her approach, a destroyer passed over her and dropped two depth charges some distance from her. Scamp continued her approach and loosed a spread of six torpedoes at a Japanese tanker. She scored a hit but had to dive in order to escape the escorts. When she surfaced, a little over an hour later, all enemy shipping was out of sight. Continuing her patrol into the Bismarck Islands, Scamp patrolled to the southeast of Steffen Strait, between New Ireland and New Hanover. At 17:54, still on July 27, 1943, she sighted a submarine, which launched a torpedo at Scamp. Scamp went ahead full crash dive and leveled off at , letting the torpedo pass above her. Less than ten minutes later, she returned to periscope depth to engage her adversary. At 18:12, she launched four torpedoes and the Japanese boat erupted in a tremendous explosion. At the time, it was believed that the loser of that duel was the Japanese submarine I-24. Later analysis of Japanese records indicated that it was not; rather, it was I-168, which had previously sunk the disabled aircraft carrier and the destroyer at the Battle of Midway a year earlier on June 7, 1942. By August 8, 1943, Scamp was back in Brisbane. After almost a month in port at Brisbane, the fleet submarine stood out on her fourth war patrol. She again patrolled off the Solomon Islands and into the Bismarck Sea. On September 18, 1943, she attacked a three-ship convoy and crippled one of them. Another changed course and avoided her torpedoes. Scamp passed close under the stricken enemy, trying to evade her escorts and came under machine gun fire from her victim. She escaped the pursuit of the enemy destroyers but lost the undamaged quarry in a rain squall. Scamp returned to finish off the 8614 ton passenger-cargo ship Kansai Maru, which she succeeded in doing late that night. On the morning of September 21, 1943, Scamp happened upon a heavily guarded convoy and began to stalk it. After dark, she moved in for the kill and, after launching three torpedoes, heard two double explosions. Her second attack was foiled by a severe rain squall. However, Scamp hounded the convoy all through the day on September 22 and, at around 03:00 on September 23, unleashed four torpedoes at the convoy. While still maneuvering to attack the convoy, she passed through the wreckage of Kansai Maru and came upon an empty boat containing the sunken ship's logs and other documents. These were taken on board and later turned over to intelligence. Scamp made one more attempt upon the convoy, but was driven off by planes and kept down by aerial bombs. On September 24, she was ordered to terminate her patrol and she re-entered Brisbane on October 1, 1943. Fifth and sixth war patrols She cleared port again on October 22 and began her fifth patrol with a mission in support of the Treasury Island invasion, October 28‚Äì30. From there, she moved to her patrol area, between Kavieng and Truk. On November 4, she launched three torpedoes at a passenger-cargo ship. One exploded prematurely, but one reached its mark. By the time of the explosion indicating success, Scamp was already in a dive evading a depth charge attacker. Six days later, she disabled the 6481 ton Tokyo Maru; then, after evading the escorts, fired three more torpedoes into the listing target. At about 21:00, the cripple was observed being towed away. It was later learned that Tokyo Maru sank before daybreak. On November 12, she damaged light cruiser Agano, so severely that the enemy warship remained in repair at Truk until the American strike of February 16 and 17, 1944. On November 18, Scamp suffered minor shrapnel damage from two bombs dropped by an enemy float plane. Eight days later, she sailed back into Brisbane. On December 16, 1943, Scamp left Brisbane and headed back to the Bismarck Archipelago for her sixth war patrol. On the night of January 6, 1944, she missed a small tanker and was boxed in by the sound search of two Japanese destroyers. At 2323, she was able to surface and clear the area while the convoy escorts hunted for her about astern. On January 14, she slipped by two destroyers to launch six torpedoes at Nippon Maru. The 9,975 ton tanker sank as Scamp made her escape. Foiled in an attempt to return to the area, she headed south to act as plane guard north of Lyra Reef for B-24 bombers. On February 6, she put into Milne Bay, New Guinea, for refit. Seventh war patrol Scamp spent her seventh war patrol searching the shipping lanes between New Guinea, Palau, and Mindanao in the Philippines. She exited Milne Bay on March 3, 1944 and, after uneventful patrolling, put in at Langemak Bay, from March 29 to 31 for repairs to her torpedo data computer. Following her resumption of patrol, she battle surfaced on April 4 and set fire to a 200-ton trawler, but broke off the action when her deck gun failed. Three days later, south of Davao Gulf, she encountered six cruisers escorted by destroyers and planes. She dived and the destroyers passed overhead without noticing her presence a scant below the surface. She returned to the surface at 1405 but was forced down by a plane. A little later, she tried to surface again but was attacked by a diving float plane. As she crash dived to escape the enemy plane, an aerial bomb exploded. All hands were knocked off their feet by the explosion and all power was lost. Scamp began to take an up angle and started to settle rapidly. At just below , she began to hang on, then started up. The diving officer reported that the hydraulic controller had been jarred to \\"off\\" in the attack and that the hydraulic plant started closing all the main vents as fire started filling the maneuvering and after torpedo rooms with a thick, toxic smoke. Fortunately, the sub caught at , the decision having been made to surface and slug it out with the deck gun if she could not be held below . Scamp started down again, \\"see sawed\\" three times, and started down a third time before power was regained. Soon the submarine was making two thirds speed on each shaft and had leveled off at . She released oil and air bubbles to appear to have sunk and then headed for the Admiralty Islands. At 21:06, she surfaced and, with a 17 degree list, made for Seeadler Harbor, Manus, where she arrived on April 16, 1944. Eighth war patrol and loss She made emergency repairs at Manus, shifted to Milne Bay on April 22 and then moved on to Pearl Harbor for a thorough overhaul at the yard. Scamp set out on her eighth war patrol on October 16. She fueled at Midway Island on October 20, then set course for the Bonin Islands. On November 9, she acknowledged a message changing her patrol area. She reported her position to be about north of the Bonin Islands with all 24 torpedoes aboard and 77,000 US gallons (290,000 L) of fuel remaining. On November 14 she was ordered to take up the life guard station off Tokyo Bay in support of B-29 Superfortress bomber strikes, but failed to acknowledge the message. Scamp was never heard from again. From records available after the war, it appears that Scamp was sighted by Japanese planes and reported depth charged by Kaibokan CD-4 to the south of Tokyo Bay on November 11, 1944. Scamp was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on April 28, 1945. Scamp (SS-277) earned seven battle stars for World War II service.

It is mostly between and above sea-level and is enclosed by the higher altitude Dark Peak (also known as the High Peak) to the west, north and east. Area Broadly speaking, the White Peak covers the Derbyshire and Staffordshire parts of the Peak District from the Hope Valley southwards to the Weaver Hills near the Churnet Valley. As defined by Natural England, the White Peak national character area covers and includes the area approximately bounded by Ashbourne, Buxton, Castleton, Matlock and Wirksworth. Cressbrook Dale, one of several steep-sided valleys that cut into the limestone plateau Geology and soils The geology of the White Peak has its origins in the Carboniferous Period, when the area was under a shallow sea that was fringed by reefs, leading to thick deposits of shelly calcareous material. Over millions of years the area rose up and subsided several times, leading to muddy, sandy and peaty deposits overlying the calcareous shells. Compression turned the deposits into rock - the shells became limestone, and the overlying deposits became gritstone, shales and coal. Further uplifting and folding raised the area into an anticline (the Derbyshire Dome), then subsequent erosion removed the younger deposits to expose the limestone.Christian, pp24-27 The limestone consists of three types: pale grey, thickly bedded, gently dipping shelf limestone of much of the central plateau; darker grey, more thinly bedded, more folded basin limestone in the south west; and hard, unbedded reef limestone that forms cone-like hills on the plateau periphery. Limestone is porous, so caves, limestone gorges and dry valleys are common features of the area. The soils are mostly derived from loess deposited by cold winds in the last part of the last glacial period. Notable valleys in the White Peak include Dovedale, Monsal Dale, Lathkill Dale and the Manifold Valley. The area is of interest to geologists, since much of the underlying strata have been exposed by extensive quarrying, and can be seen in the old railway cuttings along the Monsal Trail through Monsal Dale and Millers Dale. Ecology The generally good quality loess soil means much of the area is agriculturally productive pasture, though hay meadows - containing species such as Rhinanthus minor (yellow rattle) and Galium verum (lady‚Äôs bedstraw)- occur in places. On steep slopes and higher points where soils are shallower and pasture improvement difficult, species-rich calcareous grassland can be found, containing species such as Orchis mascula (early purple orchid), Primula veris (cowslip) and Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme). On high ground leaching has resulted in acidic grassland - where Viola lutea (mountain pansy) and Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) occur - and, in a few places, remnants of limestone heath. Minimally grazed north-facing slopes of dales are a national stronghold of Polemonium caeruleum (Jacob's ladder), the county flower of Derbyshire. The White Peak is a national stronghold of Polemonium caeruleum (Jacob's ladder) Settlements The largest towns in the White Peak are outside the area of the Peak District national park. These towns include Matlock, Wirksworth and Buxton, while Bakewell and most of the villages in the park are in the White Peak area. Around the areas of Tideswell, Hartington, Flagg, Chelmorton and Youlgrave, long thin fields created by the enclosure of medieval strip fields can be seen. Footpaths The region is rich in footpaths, bridleways and green tracks that give access to the area. Longer- distance routes include the Limestone Way, the Peak District Boundary Walk and the Pennine Bridleway, and former railway trackbeds such as the Monsal Trail, the High Peak Trail, the Tissington Trail and the Manifold Way.

It is mainly in Derbyshire and parts of Staffordshire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. It gets its name because (in contrast to the White Peak), the underlying limestone is covered by a cap of Millstone Grit sandstones with softer shale underneath, meaning that in winter the soil is almost always saturated with water. The land is thus largely uninhabited moorland plateaux where almost any depression is filled with sphagnum bogs and black peat. The High Peak is an alternative name for the Dark Peak, but High Peak is also the name of an administrative district of Derbyshire which includes part of the White Peak. The areas of Millstone Grit form an 'inverted horseshoe' around the lower uncapped limestone areas of the White Peak, enclosing it to the west, north and east. Hence the Dark Peak is said to cover the higher, northern moors between the Hope Valley and South Pennines, the Western Moors stretching south to near the Churnet Valley, and the Eastern Moors southwards towards Matlock. The Dark Peak is one of 159 National Character Areas defined by Natural England; as defined by Natural England, the Dark Peak NCA covers and includes the northern block of hills approximately bounded by Marsden, Stocksbridge, Hathersage and Chapel-en-le-Frith, plus the eastern moors between Hathersage and Matlock, but excludes the western moors between Chapel and the Churnet Valley (which it places in NCA 53, the South West Peak), and the area around Glossop (in NCA 54, Manchester Pennine Fringe). An area of is designated as the Dark Peak Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which excludes the separately designated Eastern Moors. The SSSI extends over the borders into Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. A large part of the SSSI is included in the South Pennine Moors Special Area of Conservation.SAC Standard Data Form Principal upland areas within the Dark Peak include Kinder Scout, Bleaklow (both of which rise to over ), Black Hill, the Roaches, Shining Tor, Mam Tor, Win Hill and Stanage Edge.  Aircraft crashes  Over the years, military aircraft have crashed on the Dark Peak, generally due to a combination of numerous nearby air bases, inexperienced pilots, primitive or faulty equipment and poor visibility. Because of the bleakness and emptiness of the high moorlands and the consequent difficulties of recovery, substantial wreckage remains at some sites in remote parts of the moorland, though militarily sensitive materials were removed and salvage teams sometimes gathered debris into piles, or burned or buried it. There have been reports of ghost planes in the area, usually of a low-flying, propeller-driven plane seemingly in difficulty before crashing into the moors. People who recovered items from the crash site were allegedly then visited by ghosts.

It lies east of Buxton on the B6049, in a wide valley on a limestone plateau, at an altitude of above sea level, and is within the District of Derbyshire Dales. The population (including Wheston) was 1,820 in 2001, increasing slightly to 1,827 at the 2011 Census, making it the second-largest settlement within the National Park, after Bakewell. Tideswell Dale is a short limestone valley leading south from the village to the River Wye valley. Name There is some debate as to how the village got its name. The English Place Name Society accepts it as being named after a Saxon chieftain named Tidi, others that the name comes from a \\"tiding well\\" situated in the north of the village. This 'ebbing and flowing' well was declared to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Peak by Thomas Hobbes in his 1636 book De Mirabilibus Pecci. Tideswell is known locally as Tidza or Tidsa. In addition, local residents are known as Sawyeds, owing to a traditional story about a farmer who freed his prize cow from a gate in which it had become entangled, by sawing its head off. Today the story is re-enacted raucously and colourfully every Wakes week by a local mummers group called the Tidza Guisers. History and heritage Tideswell well dressing is usually at the end of Junehttp://www.welldressing.com/venue.php?id=117 In the Middle Ages, Tideswell was a market town known for lead mining. The Tideswell lead miners were renowned for their strength and were much prized by the military authorities. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists TIDESUUELLE as the King's land in the charge of William Peverel with fewer than five households. Tideswell is now best known for its 14th-century parish church, the Church of St John the Baptist, known as the \\"Cathedral of the Peak\\", which contains three 15th-century misericords. A sundial lies in the churchyard; it is positioned on steps which local historian Neville T. Sharpe thinks likely to be those of the village's market cross. A market and two-day fair were granted to the village in 1251. The Foljambe family, later the Foljambe baronets, were the principal landowners from the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries. The town has a week-long festival near the summer solstice known as the Wakes, culminating in \\"Big Saturday\\", which includes a torchlight procession through the streets, led by a brass band playing a unique tune called the Tideswell Processional,A Tideswell Man's blog and townsfolk dancing a traditional weaving dance. Taste Tideswell In May 2009, Tideswell won a ¬£400,000 grant from the Big Lottery Fund's Village SOS programme. In a bid to help keep its village shops open and thriving‚Äîover 20 shops had closed in the preceding decade‚ÄîTaste Tideswell was created, to reconnect local people with their food and make Tideswell famous as a food destination. On 6 December 2010 the Tideswell School of Food opened, running full-priced cookery and brewing courses as well as subsidised community courses. The School of Food was intended to be the financial engine for the project that would help to develop work in the community. It closed during 2014 because of cashflow issues. Tideswell Made is a quality mark that local food producers, retailers, public houses and holiday accommodation can buy into. Ensuring products are sourced as locally as possible and made locally, Tideswell Made is marketed by Taste Tideswell and helps local business get wider recognition for their locally made produce. Taste Tideswell has an education service, visiting schools with a variety of food- and growing-related activities. School groups also visit the School of Food for practical hands-on activities. Behind the Parish Church, a small community garden has been developed to provide a training ground for those wanting to learn more about growing. There is also a small commercial kitchen available for hire by local food producers, particularly those who are looking to make the step up from home-based production. In May 2011, the first Tideswell Food Festival was held, attracting over 2,000 people, despite poor weather. On 7 September 2011, the Taste Tideswell story was broadcast as part of the Village SOS series on BBC One. It showed the rapid development of the project, along with the individual story of Tim Nicol, the 'Village Champion' who moved to live in Tideswell for a year and helped the volunteer directors get Taste Tideswell established. As of August 2011, Taste Tideswell employed eight members of staff, most of whom lived in the village, and had ten visiting chef/tutors on its books. Although the School of Food had to close, Tideswell's annual Food Festival has continued to be a success each year. Facilities and activities Tideswell Sports Complex was built in 2001 following a ¬£1.2 million Sports Lottery grant and substantial fund-raising in the village. There are two football pitches, a floodlit multi-use area with two tennis courts and five-a-side pitches marked out, a cricket ground, crown- green bowling area, a skate-park and two pavilions. The town has a football team, Tideswell United, and they play in the Hope Valley League 'A' Division. They also run a reserve side competing in the Hope Valley League B Division as Tideswell United Blue Star. The ground has floodlights for midweek games, one of few sides at such a low level to use them. The bowling club competes in local leagues, the cricket and tennis clubs compete in local friendly matches. The village has a long theatrical tradition, Tideswell Theatre having been formed over 200 years ago to perform leading plays of the time. It was revived in 2002 to bring professional-quality theatre, music, dance and comedy to the area. Tideswell Community Players are one of the oldest drama groups in the country, formed in 1929. Until the 1960s the village also had its own cinema, The Picturehouse. Tideswell Cinema was revived in 2005 to bring film once more to the community, with screenings for three seasons at Bishop Pursglove School's hall, before relocating in 2008 to the upper storey of The George Hotel.

He was Champion Jockey for 13 consecutive years until 1886, riding 2,748 winners from 8,084 starts, in so doing setting records for the number of Champion Jockey titles (13), number of wins in a season (246) and number of race wins (2748) which remained unthreatened until the arrival of Steve Donoghue and Sir Gordon Richards well into the 20th century. Delirious from wasting and the loss of his wife during childbirth, he committed suicide at the age of 29. Early life Archer was born at St. George's Cottage, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire on 11 January 1857, the second son of jockey William Archer and Emma Hayward, daughter of publican William Hayward. His elder brother, William, was also a jockey. His younger brother, Charles, was also a jockey, and later a trainer. He had at least one sister, Alice. William Archer was a short, squat man, who had taken a stud of English horses to Russia in 1842, and the year after Fred was born won the Grand National on Little Charlie. He eventually became landlord of the King's Arms public house in Prestbury, near Cheltenham, of which his father-in-law was formerly proprietor. He taught Fred to box. Emma was \\"a big, fine-looking woman with handsome aquiline features\\" who some presumed to have been of good stock. Fred was said to have inherited his spirit from her, even if he adopted his profession from his father. He was only semi-literate. When Archer was two, the family moved to Prestbury, where he was educated a first learned to ride. A \\"quick, retentive, and exceedingly secretive boy\\", by the age of eight he was riding in pony and donkey races, losing his first match on a pony, against a donkey. This may have been one of two races he rode on a pony called Mossrose at Great Malvern. William disciplined him sternly to make him improve. He soon began winning races, even after breaking his leg while out hunting. In contradiction of his later reputation as a miser, Archer would send money home to his family, who were always in debt. At first it was postal orders for a few shillings, but as his success grew, this increased to fivers and latterly big sums. Career Vanity Fair At the suggestion of a hunting acquaintance, William Le Terriere, Archer was apprenticed to trainer Mathew Dawson at Heath House in Newmarket, Suffolk, now home to trainer Mark Prescott, for five years. Some sources say this was in February 1868, others that it was the day before his 10th birthday. He weighed 4st 11 lb. William and Fred spent a week there, after which Dawson told William, \\"He will do, Archer, you may leave him.\\" Archer served Dawson as a stable jockey from 1874 until 1886. He married Dawson's niece, Helen Rose Dawson. At Dawson's stable, the delicate Archer was bullied by the older boys, but with no children of their own, the Dawsons took him almost as a surrogate. Mrs Dawson called him \\"the little cat\\", and to Mr Dawson the relationship was close to father and son. His fondness for Mrs Dawson's cake and blackberry jam contributed to his weight gain, and over a good dinner, his weight could rise by 3 or 4 lb He grew to around 5 ft 10 and, over the winter, weighted 11st. He was largely illiterate when he left home but attended a night school run by Mrs Dawson during his early years there. While at Dawson's, Archer came under the tutelage of Dawson's right-hand man Jockey Swift, who claimed to have taught Archer all he knew, and Tom French. Archer was evidently in high regard at the stable, receiving wages of seven guineas compared to the five guineas typical of apprentices. One of his fellow apprentices was in fact thrown from his horse and killed during Archer's time there. Dawson demanded the same discipline of Archer as he did of other apprentices, making him stand to attention for visitors the same as any other lad. But he was aware of his ability. \\"I have a wonderful boy here who will do marvellous things,\\" he commented. Because of this, and his father's reputation, he was soon given race-riding opportunities. Aged 12, he was allowed to ride in the Newmarket Town Plate on 14 October 1869, on a three- year-old filly called Honoria. Acting as pacemaker for stablemate Stomboli, who won, Honoria came last. His first win was a steeplechase at Bangor-on-Dee in either 1869 or 1870 on a horse called Maid of Trent for an old pony-racing acquaintance of his family. His first official win under Jockey Club rules was in a two-year-old nursery handicap at Chesterfield on 28 September 1870 on a horse called Atholl Daisy. The horse was trained by John Peart at Malton, rather than Dawson. He finished the season with 2 wins and 9 seconds from 15 rides. His other winner was Lincoln Lass at Ayr. There is a story, probably apocryphal, that Archer cried because he had not ridden both winners in a dead-heat. 1870s Viscount Falmouth, Archer's patron, in a caricature by Leslie Ward. Archer's first important win was on Salvanos in the 1872 Cesarewitch, for which he weighed out at 5st 7 lb. It is said he \\"rode Salvanos with the coolness and steadiness of a veteran and thus made his mark as one of the rising lightweights.\\" When Jem Snowden rode against him for the first time, however, he commented, \\"Tha cassn't ride for nuts\\". His apprenticeship ended that year, and Dawson presented him with a gold watch inscribed for \\"good conduct\\". Archer in return commented, \\"I value this more than anything I have and shall keep it as long as I live.\\" In 1873, with leading stable jockey Tom French sick, Archer had more opportunity to succeed. He rode 107 winners and came second in the championship to Harry Constable. French, who was an influence on the young Archer, died later that year from consumption, brought on by excessive wasting. The first of Archer's Classic wins followed the next season on Atlantic in the 1874 2,000 Guineas. This made him a \\"veritable mascotte\\" for his stable. After this, he became retained jockey for Lord Falmouth, for whom he won over half of his Classics. Falmouth was Dawson's principal owner between 1870 and 1883. Archer's retainer for him was a nominal ¬£100. He finished 1874 with 147 wins from 530 rides. By now, he was riding at 6st, but weight was becoming a problem. For the Cesarewitch Handicap, he failed to make a riding weight of 6st 1 lb, putting up 3 lbs overweight and losing by a neck. Archer blamed wasting for taking his strength away. Spinaway was the star filly of the following season, winning the 1,000 Guineas and Oaks double. In 1877, he won his first Derby, on Lord Falmouth's Silvio, and followed up in the St. Leger. 1879 was the championship year of Wheel of Fortune, one of Archer's favourite horses, that he thought was \\"wonderfully good\\". She was small, at , leading the Duke of Portland to say she \\"looked like a polo pony\\" with Archer's long legs round her. Like Spinaway four years earlier, Wheel of Fortune won both the 1,000 Guineas and Oaks. She won the Yorkshire Oaks in August as well but was prevented an attempt at the Triple Crown when she broke down going for a second race at York two days later. One of Archer's most notable victories came in the 1880 Derby. He came from behind on Bend Or with an \\"extraordinary rush\\", to beat Robert the Devil by a head. He took the inside of the turn at Tattenham Corner, along the rails, with a \\"nerve of iron\\". By the end of the 1870s, he was struggling to make 8st 7 lb. 1880s Rosa Corder, Fred Archer, Restrike etching By the 1880s, his annual income was around ¬£10,000 (equivalent to about ¬£1.2 million in 2020https://www.in2013dollars.com/uk/inflation/1880?amount=1), made up of retainers, gifts from owners and gamblers, and nearly ¬£2,500 in riding fees. Archer's win on Dutch Oven in the St Leger caused controversy. It had been presumed that the filly had not stayed the distance when losing the Great Yorkshire Stakes at York, so she was sent off at odds of 40/1 for the Leger. When she won, Archer was accused of pulling the horse at York to get longer odds for the Leger. In fact, Archer had not wanted to ride Dutch Oven in the race at all, preferring the John Porter-trained Geheimniss. Falmouth withdrew from racing in 1883. It has been suggested that this was prompted by a suspicion that Archer pulled Galliard in the Derby, being beaten into third by St Blaise and Highland Chief. Archer was accused of not showing the same will to win that he had on Bend Or or Iroquois, and Highland Chief was trained by his brother Charles, which seemed to be circumstantial evidence of his guilt. Against this, Fred had no previous history of helping his brother in this way, and Charles had once sent him through the rails when riding against him. It seems highly unlikely Archer would have thrown the Derby in this way. Retainers with the Duke of Portland and Lord Hastings brought him a combined ¬£2,000 per year, the Duke of Westminster ¬£1,000, and Lord Alington ¬£500. He married Rose Nellie Dawson, eldest daughter of John Dawson, on 31 January 1883 at All Saints' Church in Newmarket. It was called the celebrity wedding of the decade. The whole town was involved, and it concluded with a firework display which had spelled out \\"May they be happy‚Äù. In January 1884, the couple's infant son, William, died at birth. He had been named after Archer's brother, who had been killed in a hurdle race at Cheltenham. Nellie was left in a critical condition but recovered to become pregnant again almost immediately. On 6 November 1884, she gave birth to a daughter, also Nellie. Fred received a telegram about the birth after riding Thebais to victory in the Liverpool Cup. But the mother was again left dangerously ill after the birth, with symptoms of post-natal eclampsia. Archer arrived home to find his wife was dying. Her convulsions continued until she died. Archer later told a friend, ‚ÄúShe did not know me and never spoke to me again.\\" In 1884, on his only visit to Thirsk Racecourse, his arrival was announced in the market place by the town crier. He had only two rides, but both won Jovial for Tom Green in the High-weight Selling Handicap and Laverock for Matt Dawson in the Sixth Great Yorkshire Foal Stakes. That year, of 377 rides, he won 241. His most successful year was probably 1885, when he won the 2,000 Guineas on Paradox, the Oaks on Lonely, the Derby and St. Leger on Melton, and the Grand Prix, also on Paradox. In his final season, he won the Derby and St. Leger on Ormonde. Archer took his sport very seriously and was noted for his ruthlessness. In 1882, he built Falmouth Lodge and Stables (now Pegasus Stables). In 1885, he rode 246 winners, a record that was unbroken until Gordon Richards' 1933 season. He won The Derby five times and won a total of 21 classic races. In total, he rode 2,748 winners in 8,084 races (some sources say 8,004), a win percentage of over 34%. Appearance He was slim, graceful, with remarkably small hands and feet, and eyes of a cold blue-grey, or, according to other sources, sorrowful brown eyes, in a long pale face. He had pronounced front teeth, meaning his lips did not quite meet. He also had a round-shouldered stoop, typical of tall jockeys. He could have passed as a gentleman, and some, including Lord Rosebery, thought he may have been the son of Lord Wilton. Personality and critical opinion Stevengraph silk-woven portrait of Fred Archer, wearing the racing colours Scarlet jacket and cap of \\"Mr Manton\\" (Duchess of Montrose)In October 2010 a Stevengraph silk portrait of Archer sold at auction for ¬£320 (\\"Focus on: The tragic Fred Archer\\". Western Daily Press. 23 October 2010.) Archer \\"captured the public imagination as no other jockey had ever done\\". In his early career he was known as a severe rider, who was not sparing with whip and spurs on the horse. This was a style he may have adopted under the influence of stable jockey Tom French. He was always first down to the start, so as to get the best starting place and was obedient to the starter, unlike some other jockeys. He was always quick away, \\"like a greyhound from the slips\\". He would let his horse's head hang loose, and get the horse going with a touch of the spur. Miserliness He was a taciturn and morose character, known for being miserly with money, hence the nickname \\"Tin Man\\". He made shrewd investments of most of his income, but the squandering of much of a reputed ¬£250,000 fortune (equivalent to ¬£32.7 million in 2020https://www.in2013dollars.com/uk/inflation/1886?amount=1) by the time of his death challenges the perception of acquisitiveness, which may have been partly cultivated. He seemed to take perverse satisfaction in it. He is reputed to have asked bystanders for coins he could put in his breeches to increase his weight when he was short a few pounds for his race, only never to return them. But he could also be generous. He was also known to throw a ball for colleagues each winter, and once, before a trip to America in November 1884, he left a blank cheque for his friend Herbert Mills, in case he was in need. He was a reckless gambler, with losing runs bringing him close to running out of cash, but he always maintained his integrity, sometimes winning against his own money. Trainer opinion Trainer John Porter said of Archer, \\"His whole heart and soul were in the business he had in hand. He was almost invariably the first to weigh out, the first at the starting post, the first away as the flag fell, and, as the record shows, very often the first to pass the winning post. I am afraid he was not too scrupulous. Very masterful, he generally had pretty much his own way, especially in minor races. If he did not want a horse to run, he never hesitated to suggest to the owner he should keep the animal in the stable that day. In short, Fred Archer was a powerful personality as well as a brilliantly successful jockey.\\" Another trainer, John Osborne Jr. said, \\"He became so conceited that no man believed more in Mr Archer than Fred Archer the jockey\\", but this was not a universal opinion. In 1879, The World newspaper wroter \\"a very large income, the unbounded confidence of employers and public might help to turn less ordinary heads, but Fred Archer quietly goes his own way and studies diligently to improve his calling\\". And after his death George Lambton said, \\"Even when quite a boy he was courted and flattered by every kind of man and woman, and early in life he became the idol of the public... and yet he never suffered from that prevalent and disagreeable complaint, 'swollen head'. I think the shrewd, hard common sense of Mat Dawson, for whom he had the greatest affection and respect, was a great help to him.\\" Dawson was not entirely complimentary about him, calling him \\"that damned, long-legged, tin-scrapping young devil\\". Other comments His sister Alice spoke of him thus. \\"He was gentle, but he took no liberties himself and no one ever thought of taking one with him. And he was always so quiet. There was never any ranting and raving. He would also rather be two minutes early than two minutes late.\\" Others have said similar. \\"He was a polite and driven man, whose life would have been so much easier had he been five inches shorter.\\" Lambton described him as having \\"the shadow of melancholy in his face which indicated a side to his nature never far absent even in his brightest days\\". Friend and fellow jockey, Fred Webb, \\"It is not wasting that makes Archer so thin and worn. He wears that worried look because he cannot ride two winners in one race.\\" Archer \\"rode like a man possessed\\" and \\"had the devil at his elbow\\". He could ride rough when necessary, but his success has been attributed primarily to his coolness and to judgement of pace. He had the \\"passion of a lover for what he did\\". One contemporary newspaper described him as \\"all jockey, from the button of his cap to the tips of his spurs, and rode irrespective of the odds. Whether on a 6 to 4 or a 20 to 1 chance he equally strove to win.\\" In his lifetime, his fame rivalled that of royalty. Once, leaving Ascot Racecourse, the first-class train, full of MPs and members of the aristocracy was held up for him. He was particularly popular with women. Lady Hastings wrote \\"the way in which some women ran after Archer was amazing\\", and it was widely believed that the Duchess of Montrose (1818-1894) (who raced under the pseudonym \\"Mr Manton\\"), who was 40 years older than Archer, wanted to marry him and invited him to her home and the theatre. In 1888 she did in fact marry, aged 70 and as her 3rd husband, a 24 year-old man. In the end, he outgrew his profession. London cab drivers would shout \\"Archer's up\\" to mean that everything was alright with the world. Death Grave of jockey Frederick James Archer, Newmarket, Suffolk Because of his height (5 ft 10in/1.78 m) Archer had to diet far more than other jockeys. His racing weight was 8st 10 lb in later years, and to keep to it he used Turkish baths, abstained almost totally from solid food, and used alkaline medicines to purge. A Newmarket doctor, JR Wright, created a special purgative which became known as \\"Archer's Mixture\\", which he drank by the sherry glass. His diet consisted of half an orange, a sardine and a nip of champagne, or castor oil, a biscuit and a small champagne at midday, and he once left the dining room on the sight of a steak and kidney pie. He was a poor walker, and could hardly run, which reduced his ability to lose weight through exercise. In October 1886, he had to lose 6 lbs over two days, for his first, and ultimately, only ride in Ireland - Cambusmore for Lord Londonderry in the Lieutenant's Plate at The Curragh, a race he won easily On his return, he wasted down to 8st 7 lb for the Cambridgeshire by going three days without food. This was still 1 lb overweight and cost him the race on St Mirin, as he was beaten by a head. The afternoon was very cold, and he fell seriously ill. He still undertook engagements at Brighton and on the first day at Lewes on the Thursday, but here he is reported to have \\"taken a chill\\" which \\"developed into fever of a typhoid character\\", forcing him to return home. He was declared ill on the Saturday, and by Sunday he was in a state of high fever. The next day, Monday 8 November 1886, he was at his residence, Falmouth House, Newmarket, under medical supervision. About 2.25pm his sister, Mrs Colman, visited him in his room and he asked her to send the nurse away. Colman was looking out of the window when Archer got out of bed. She then heard him say \\"Are they coming?\\" and saw he had the gun in his hand. She sprang towards him, and while she was struggling with him, he put the gun in his mouth and fired the revolver. He died bleeding in her arms, the bullet having passed out of the back of his neck. The doctor was on the scene very quickly and pronounced him dead. The verdict of the jury at the inquest was: \\"That the deceased committed suicide whilst in a state of unsound mind\\". His death at the age of 29 occurred on 8 November 1886; his wife had died on 7 November, two years earlier. The death of his wife was a factor. \\"Poor Nellie - she was my glory, my pride, my life, my all,\\" he had earlier told a friend. \\"She was taken from me at the very moment that my happiness did really seem to me to be so great and complete as to leave nothing else in this world that I could wish for.\\" He was also ¬£30,000 in debt on his betting, exacerbated by having heavily backed St Mirin. He had reportedly not been his \\"old self\\" for the past year. The gun had been bought because Falmouth House was in an exposed location and he had had trouble with housebreakers. He was buried in Newmarket cemetery on 12 November. Wreaths were sent by the Duke of Westminster and the Prince of Wales. His burial plot can be found there to the right of the chapel. He left a fortune of ¬£66,662 (equal to about ¬£ million today) to his only daughter, the inheritance being looked after by trustees during her minority. At one time, he was rumoured to be worth ¬£250,000. Some of his effects are now on display at the National Horseracing Museum, including the gun with which he shot himself. News of Archer's death reached far beyond racing. In London, special editions of the evening newspapers were issued, with crowds queuing in Fleet Street to buy them, and omnibuses stopped to allow commuters to read the billboards. The adoration the public showed for him was close to that shown for Diana, Princess of Wales over a century later. He was survived by his second child, Nellie, who was brought up by her grandparents in the Newmarket area. She married shipping magnate, Max Tosetti in 1911. Legacy Archer's life has been fictionalised in two books - The Tinman's Farewell by Michael Tanner and Just One More Smile by his great-granddaughter Diana Foster. His ghost is said to ride a light grey horse over Newmarket Heath.

It articulates with the third metacarpal bone (the middle finger) and forms the third carpometacarpal joint. The capitate bone is the largest of the carpal bones in the human hand. It presents, above, a rounded portion or head, which is received into the concavity formed by the scaphoid and lunate bones; a constricted portion or neck; and below this, the body.Gray's Anatomy (1918). See infobox. The bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with the \\"third distal carpal\\" of reptiles and amphibians. Structure The capitate is the largest carpal bone found within the hand. The capitate is found within the distal row of carpal bones. The capitate lies directly adjacent to the metacarpal of the ring finger on its distal surface, has the hamate on its ulnar surface and trapezoid on its radial surface, and abuts the lunate and scaphoid proximally. Surfaces The superior surface is round, smooth, and articulates with the lunate bone. The inferior surface is divided by two ridges into three facets, for articulation with the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones, that for the third being the largest. The dorsal surface is broad and rough. The palmar surface is narrow, rounded, and rough, for the attachment of ligaments and a part of the adductor pollicis muscle. The lateral surface articulates with the lesser multangular by a small facet at its anterior inferior angle, behind which is a rough depression for the attachment of an interosseous ligament. Above this is a deep, rough groove, forming part of the neck, and serving for the attachment of ligaments; it is bounded superiorly by a smooth, convex surface, for articulation with the scaphoid bone. The medial surface articulates with the hamate bone by a smooth, concave, oblong facet, which occupies its posterior and superior parts; it is rough in front, for the attachment of an interosseous ligament. Variation The capitate bone variably articulates with the metacarpal of the index finger. However, its normal articulation is with the middle finger. Development The ossification of capitate starts at 1 ‚Äì 5 months. Function The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. They allow movements of the wrist from side to side (medial to lateral) as well as up and down (anterior to posterior). Dr. H. A. Harris wrote in The British Medical Journal in 1944 that \\"the strength of construction of the hand in a man is concentrated in the radius, thumb, and index and middle fingers.\\" Therefore, the capitate is larger to support the strength and stress that the middle finger undergoes. Clinical significance A capitate fracture accounts for 1.3% of all wrist fractures. Isolated fractures of the capitate comprise only 0.3% and are often non- displace. This is since the capitate is at the centre of the carpal region and is therefore quite well protected. Capitate fractures occur together with fractures of another carpal bone, the scaphoid. Various mechanisms for fractures of the capitate have been postulated. Adler et al. described three mechanisms‚Äîthe first is direct trauma to the dorsal surface of the bone, the second is fall on the palm with the wrist in forced extension and the third is fall on the forcefully flexed hand; the second being the most frequent and the third rarest. In the case of an acute capitate fracture where there is x-ray evidence of excellent alignment of the fracture fragments, the attending doctor will immobilise the wrist in a plaster or lightweight wrist brace. Once the cast has been removed the patient begins physiotherapy to regain the range of movement of the wrist joint and strength in the muscles involved. If x-rays show that the capitate fracture fragments are out of alignment, surgery is indicated. A surgeon can use small compression screws or K-wires to unite the two pieces of bone. The headless compression screw has advantage over the K-wire as it provides compression across the fracture site and allows early motion. It may be the case that the ligament between the —Åapitate and the scaphoid bone is also injured; if so, this would be repaired at the same time.http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1238278-treatment Because the capitate has a poor blood supply there are sometimes complications with the healing process. This may manifest itself as a diffuse ache in the wrist upon activity, and can persist for many months. This is due to a breakdown of the capitate caused by the lack of blood supply and healing (avascular necrosis). Nonunion has been reported as the most common complication; 19.6% to 56% in isolated capitate fractures. Early diagnosis is key to preventing this. Etymology The etymology derives from the Latin ', \\"having a head,\\" from -, meaning \\"head.\\"  Additional images  File:Capitate bone (left hand) - animation01.gifPosition of capitate bone (shown in red).

The introduced nobility is divided into three ranks: Comital families, Baronial families and untitled noble families (in addition, members of the royal family hold ducal titles). The unintroduced nobility consists of families of princely, ducal, marquis, comital, baronial, and untitled noble rank. This group notably includes several branches of the House of Bernadotte with foreign (princely and comital) noble titles (such as Count of Wisborg). The vast majority of both introduced and unintroduced noble families are untitled. Introduced nobility The introduced noble families are listed in the Palace of the Nobility according to the official numbering system which roughly corresponds to the order of introduction. Lower numbers indicate older nobility. Higher numbers indicate later introduction, and usually means that the family belongs to the younger nobility, even though introduction may occasionally not have followed immediately upon ennoblement. In the case of families of Countly or Baronial status, higher numbers indicate that it was raised to a higher title at a later point in time. Branches of the same family may have been introduced under different numbers and may appear in more than one place in the list.

A goatee is a style of facial hair incorporating hair on a man's chin but not his cheeks. The exact nature of the style has varied according to time and culture. Description Traditional goatee with moustache (19th century) A more modern combination of goatee and moustache Until the late 20th century, the term goatee was used to refer solely to a beard formed by a tuft of hair on the chin‚Äîas on the chin of a goat, hence the term 'goatee'. By the 1990s, the word had become an umbrella term used to refer to any facial hair style incorporating hair on the chin but not the cheeks; there is debate over whether this style is correctly called a goatee or a Van Dyke. History The style dates back to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. The god Pan was traditionally depicted with goat-like features, including a goatee. When Christianity became the dominant religion and began copying imagery from pagan myth, Satan was given the likeness of Pan, leading to Satan traditionally being depicted with a goatee in medieval art and Renaissance art. The goatee would not enjoy widespread popularity again until the 1940s, when it became a defining trait of the beatniks in the post-World War II United States. The style remained popular amongst the counter-culture until the 1960s before falling out of favor again. In the 1990s, goatees with incorporated mustaches became fashionable for men across all socioeconomic classes and professions, and have remained popular into the 2010s. In popular culture In the media, goatees have often been used to designate an evil or morally questionable character; the convention has most consistently been applied in media depicting evil twins, with a goatee often being the sole physical difference between the twins. Goatees have also been used to signify a character's transformation from positive or neutral to evil. The use of goatees to designate evil characters has become enough of a trope that researchers from the University of Warwick conducted a study to assess the reasons for its prevalence. The study found that the human brain tends to perceive downwards- facing triangles as inherently threatening; brains tend to perceive goatees as making the human face resemble a downwards-facing triangle, causing individuals to subconsciously perceive those with goatees as inherently sinister or threatening. In media depicting members of counter-cultures, goatees have also been used to differentiate between average characters and those belonging to some subgroup. Examples include Bob Denver on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, whose goatee serves to identify him as a beatnik; Shaggy Rogers on Scooby Doo, Where Are You?, who is, in part, identified as a hippie by his goatee; and the DC Comics superhero Green Arrow, who was visually redesigned with such a beard in the late 1960s, inspiring writer Dennis O'Neil to re-imagine him as a politically active counter-culture hero. In India, the popularity of keeping a goatee was revived after the movie 'Dil Chahta Hai' released which showed actor Amir Khan supporting a trendy goatee.

Hampton in Arden was part of Warwickshire until the 1974 boundary changes. It lies within the Meriden Gap area of countryside between Solihull and Coventry. Hampton in Arden is a typical Arden village, but is now very much a commuter settlement for nearby Birmingham, Solihull and Coventry. In 1968 the central part of the village was designated a Conservation Area, which is an \\"area of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance\\".Solihull Council Web site Its population in the 2001 census was 1,787,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Solihull Retrieved 22 November 2009 increasing to 1,834 at the 2011 Census. History Hampton is mentioned in the Domesday Book, when it was held by Geoffrey de Wirce. \\"In Coleshill Hundred Hantone. 10 hides. Land for 22 ploughs. In lordship 2; 2 male and 2 female slaves. 50 villagers with a priest and 16 smallholders have 13 ploughs. A mill at 40d; meadow, 10 acres; woodland 3 leagues long and 3 wide. The value was and is 100s.\\" All of Geffrey's lands were held freely by Leofwin. Geffrey's wife was called Aelfeva and her English name suggests that Geffrey may have acquired his Warwickshire lands through her, by inheritance rather than by confiscation; she may have been Leofwin's heiress.Domesday Book for Warwickshire, Phillimore edited by John Morris A priest was recorded, implying that a church existed. Of the name, Hantone, Dugdale states that the name was occasioned from the situation, \\"hean\\" in the Saxon signifying high though by contraction written \\"han\\" and through corrupt pronunciation \\"ham\\".The Antiquities of Warwickshire, William Dugdale, 1656 Dugdale could find no mention of Geffrey having any children and concluded that he must have died without issue, his lands reverted to the Crown and by a grant of Henry I all his lands were passed to Nigel de Albani. Nigel had a son, Roger, surnamed Mowbray, from whom, from the middle of the 12th century the de Ardernes, became the Lords of the Manor. Afterwards it passed by marriage to the de Montford family of Coleshill and then subsequently reverted to the Crown. It was granted to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, by Queen Elizabeth I in 1570 but reverted to the Crown after his death. In 1625, it was assigned to Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I. In the early 19th century it was sold to Isaac William Lillingston who later sold the Manor of Hampton to Sir Robert Peel (former Prime Minister and founder of the modern police force). On Sir Robert's death in 1850, the manor was inherited by his son, Frederick, who did much to 'modernise' Hampton, demolishing many half-timbered and thatched cottages. He employed the architect W E Nesfield to build new dwellings, shops and lodges. Notable landmarks=The parish church of St. Mary and St. Bartholomew St. Mary and St. Bartholomew The Font Heart Shrine and Priests door Hampton in Arden Church, Warwickshire, S.E. (p.200, March 1824) The East Window Estate Cottages War Memorial The parish church of St. Mary and St. Bartholomew has a chancel, nave with narrow aisles, west tower, south porch, and north vestry. The chancel is of about mid 12th-century date. It is comparatively long and narrow for the period, in a church of this size, and it has an unusual north doorway near the west end; it is possible that it represented the complete church, at least for a short time. The nave, if not coeval, was built soon afterwards and had a late-12th-century south aisle, of which the arcade remains. Possibly the nave was of the same width as the chancel, but was widened to the north about . about the middle of the 13th century and a narrow north aisle and arcade added. The chancel arch was widened at the same time to the utmost limits permitted by the width of the chancel. For some reason, probably weakness, the north aisle was rebuilt late in the 14th century on the old foundations of the narrow aisle. This was followed by a similar rebuilding of the south aisle early in the 15th century, again without widening it. About the same time the west tower was begun, but carried up only a short way, the completion being delayed until late in the century. The last medieval alteration was the building of the clerestory in the 16th century in place of the old steeply pitched roof indicated by the lines on the tower.A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 4(1947), pp. 81‚Äì86. Date accessed: 26 March 2010. The tower bore a tall spire \\"till by the extraordinary violence of lightning and thunder happening on St.Andrew's Day, in the night, in the year 1643, it was cloven, and fell to the ground: at which time the whole fabrick, with the tower, were torn in divers places.\\" The south porch and north vestry are modern, and various repairs and restorations have been executed to other parts. The chancel was rebuilt in 1879 with the old material overseen by the architect W. E. Nesfield. All the roofs are modern. The church bells and most of their fittings were transplanted here from Manchester in 1976, where they had previously hung in the church of St John in Miles Platting, then being demolished due to subsidence. Other Yew Tree Cottage Cottages on the High Street There are some well preserved 17th century and timber framed houses, some of which are listed. Outside the village, to the south-east, is the 15th-century packhorse bridge over the River Blythe and on the former route to Kenilworth. Only . wide between the low parapets, consisting of five bays with ancient stone piers having pointed cut-water faces on the west side against the flow of the stream‚Äîand square projections on the east. The three northern arches are segmental-pointed, the southern two have been rebuilt with brick arches. East of the bridge is a ford. 15th-century Packhorse Bridge The war memorial lists the names of 23 men of the parish who were killed in World War I and one in World War II. It is dedicated; To the Glory of God and in Memory of the men of Hampton in Arden who gave their lives for their country in the cause of freedom 1914‚Äì1918 and below Sons of this place let this of you be said that you who live are worthy of your dead 1939‚Äì1945 ( there are 24 names from WW1 and 1 from WW2, one must have been added recently) . Governance Hampton in Arden is part of the Bickenhill ward of Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council and is represented by Councillors Alison Rolf, Robert Sleigh and Jim Ryan, all of the Conservative party. Nationally, it is part of the constituency of Meriden whose Member of Parliament is Saqib Bhatti of the Conservative party. It is included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament, the seven members elected in 2014 are; Philip Bradbourn OBE, (who died in December 2014) and Anthea McIntryre (Conservative), Neena Gill and Sion Simon (Labour) and Jim Carver, Bill Etheridge and Jill Seymour (UK Independence). Transport links The current Hampton-in-Arden railway station The M42 motorway, Birmingham International Airport and the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) are nearby. Hampton was at the southern end of the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway, later part of the Midland Railway. Opened as a double-track main line on 12 August 1839, the section from Whitacre to Hampton, known as the Stonebridge Railway, was downgraded to a branch line in 1842 after the opening of the line from Whitacre into Birmingham; it was singled in 1843 and lost its final passenger service in 1917 as a wartime economy measure. After lingering on as a goods line, it was closed entirely in 1935 following a bridge failure at Packwood. The line had originally enabled passengers from the Derby, Tamworth, Kingsbury, Whitacre, Shustoke and Coleshill areas to make connections at Hampton for other parts of the country, because at one time the Midland Railway and the London and North Western Railway had stations side by side at Hampton, at the point where the two lines met (called Derby Junction). The Midland station building can still be seen, but the LNWR station disappeared long ago, being replaced by the present Hampton-in-Arden railway station some 500m nearer London in 1884. The track bed of the old Midland route remains and a footpath for hikers and railway buffs runs alongside the site of the original track. Hampton is now served by hourly bus service X20 between Stratford, Solihull and Coventry operated by Johnson's of Henley-in-Arden as well as Diamond Bus C89 between Solihull and Coventry. The railway provides a link between Birmingham and Coventry approximately every 30 minutes Monday to Saturday. Sports and leisure The White Lion Public House The village has one pub, the 17th-century The White Lion public house north-east of the church on the High Street, which is plastered externally, but old beams are exposed inside. There is also one restaurant, the Beeches Bar & Grill, within an 18th- century Georgian building on Marsh Lane, with panel front door centred, topped with rectangular windows (in door or as a transom) and capped with an elaborate entablature supported by decorative pilasters. It began life as a private house but was later bought by the local George Fentham charity as a place of recreation for men. In 1913 a hall was built adjoining the house and the whole complex was used as a VAD Hospital during the First World War. After the war the hall became the equivalent of a village hall and the house reverted to being a working men's club. In the late 1980s the club was used less and less and an alternative use had to be found. In 1997 it was converted into, what is now, the Beeches Bar & Grill.

In some parts of the country the day is still celebrated. It has also been known as Shick Shack Day, or Oak and Nettle Day. In 1660, Parliament passed into law \\"An Act for a Perpetual Anniversary Thanksgiving on the Nine and Twentieth Day of May\\", declaring 29 May a public holiday \\"for keeping of a perpetual Anniversary, for a Day of Thanksgiving to God, for the great Blessing and Mercy he hath been graciously pleased to vouchsafe to the People of these Kingdoms, after their manifold and grievous Sufferings, in the Restoration of his Majesty...\\" The public holiday was abolished under the Anniversary Days Observance Act 1859, but the date retains some significance in local and institutional customs. It is, for example, still observed as Founder's Day by the Royal Hospital Chelsea, which was founded by Charles II in 1681. Ceremonies Traditional celebrations to commemorate the event often entailed the wearing of oak apples (a type of plant gall, possibly known in some parts of the country as a \\"shick-shack\\") or sprigs of oak leaves, in reference to the occasion after the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, when Charles II escaped the Roundhead army by hiding in an oak tree near Boscobel House. Anyone who failed to wear a sprig of oak risked being pelted with bird's eggs or thrashed with nettles. In Sussex, those not wearing oak were liable to be pinched, giving rise to the unofficial name of \\"Pinch-bum Day\\"; similarly it was known as \\"Bumping Day\\" in Essex. In Upton Grey, Hampshire, after the church bells had been rung at 6 am the bell-ringers used to place a large branch of oak over the church porch, and another over the lych gate. Smaller branches were positioned in the gateway of every house to ensure good luck for the rest of the year. Modern events Events still take place at Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire, Marsh Gibbon in Buckinghamshire, Great Wishford in Wiltshire (when villagers gather wood in Grovely Wood), Aston-on-Clun in Shropshire and Membury in Devon. The day is generally marked by re-enactment activities at Moseley Old Hall, West Midlands, one of the houses where Charles II hid in 1651. At Fownhope in Herefordshire the Heart of Oak Society organise an annual event, where members of the society gather at the local pub and march through the village holding flower and oak leaf decorated sticks, whilst following the society banner and a brass band. The march goes first to the church for a service, and then to houses who host refreshments. The Heart of Oak Society was previously a friendly society, but had to reform in 1989 to keep the tradition going. Although Oak Apple Day celebrations have decreased in popularity and knowledge, Fownhope has managed to keep the event going, increasing in popularity and turn-out every year. At All Saints' Church, Northampton, a statue of Charles II is garlanded with oak leaves at noon every Oak Apple Day, followed by a celebration of the Holy Communion according to the Book of Common Prayer. Oak Apple Day is also celebrated in the Cornish village of St Neot. The vicar leads a procession through the village, he is followed by the Tower Captain holding the Oak bough. A large number of the villagers follow walking to the Church. A story of the history of the event is told and then the vicar blesses the branch. The Tower Captain throws the old branch down from the top of the tower and a new one is hauled to the top. Everyone is then invited to the vicarage gardens for refreshments and a barbecue. Up to 12 noon villagers wear a sprig of \\"red\\" (new) oak and in the afternoon wear a sprig of \\"Boys Love\\" (Artemisia abrotanum); tradition dictates that the punishment for not doing this results in being stung by nettles.

In mathematics, the upper and lower incomplete gamma functions are types of special functions which arise as solutions to various mathematical problems such as certain integrals. Their respective names stem from their integral definitions, which are defined similarly to the gamma function but with different or \\"incomplete\\" integral limits. The gamma function is defined as an integral from zero to infinity. This contrasts with the lower incomplete gamma function, which is defined as an integral from zero to a variable upper limit. Similarly, the upper incomplete gamma function is defined as an integral from a variable lower limit to infinity. Definition The upper incomplete gamma function is defined as: : \\\\Gamma(s,x) = \\\\int_x^{\\\\infty} t^{s-1}\\\\,e^{-t}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t ,\\\\,! whereas the lower incomplete gamma function is defined as: : \\\\gamma(s,x) = \\\\int_0^x t^{s-1}\\\\,e^{-t}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t .\\\\,! Properties In both cases s is a complex parameter, such that the real part of s is positive. By integration by parts we find the recurrence relations :\\\\Gamma(s+1,x)= s\\\\Gamma(s,x) + x^{s} e^{-x} and : \\\\gamma(s+1,x) =s\\\\gamma(s,x) - x^{s} e^{-x}. Since the ordinary gamma function is defined as : \\\\Gamma(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} t^{s-1}\\\\,e^{-t}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t we have : \\\\Gamma(s) = \\\\Gamma(s,0) = \\\\lim_{x\\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\gamma(s,x) and : \\\\gamma(s,x) + \\\\Gamma(s,x) = \\\\Gamma(s). Continuation to complex values The lower incomplete gamma and the upper incomplete gamma function, as defined above for real positive s and x, can be developed into holomorphic functions, with respect both to x and s, defined for almost all combinations of complex x and s.DLMF, Incomplete Gamma functions, analytic continuation Complex analysis shows how properties of the real incomplete gamma functions extend to their holomorphic counterparts. =Lower incomplete Gamma functionHolomorphic extension Repeated application of the recurrence relation for the lower incomplete gamma function leads to the power series expansion: :\\\\gamma(s, x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x^s e^{-x} x^k}{s(s+1)\\\\cdots(s+k)} = x^s \\\\, \\\\Gamma(s) \\\\, e^{-x}\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{x^k}{\\\\Gamma(s+k+1)}. Given the rapid growth in absolute value of Œì(z + k) when k ‚Üí ‚àû, and the fact that the reciprocal of Œì(z) is an entire function, the coefficients in the rightmost sum are well- defined, and locally the sum converges uniformly for all complex s and x. By a theorem of Weierstra√ü, Theorem 3.9 on p.56 the limiting function, sometimes denoted as \\\\gamma^*, :\\\\gamma^*(s, z) := e^{-z}\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{z^k}{\\\\Gamma(s+k+1)} is entire with respect to both z (for fixed s) and s (for fixed z) , and, thus, holomorphic on ‚ÑÇ√ó‚ÑÇ by Hartog's theorem. Hence, the following decomposition :\\\\gamma(s,z) = z^s \\\\, \\\\Gamma(s) \\\\, \\\\gamma^*(s,z) , extends the real lower incomplete gamma function as a holomorphic function, both jointly and separately in z and s. It follows from the properties of z^s and the Œì-function, that the first two factors capture the singularities of \\\\gamma(s,z) (at z = 0 or s a non-positive integer), whereas the last factor contributes to its zeros. Multi- valuedness The complex logarithm log z = log z + i arg z is determined up to a multiple of 2œÄi only, which renders it multi-valued. Functions involving the complex logarithm typically inherit this property. Among these are the complex power, and, since zs appears in its decomposition, the Œ≥-function, too. The indeterminacy of multi-valued functions introduces complications, since it must be stated how to select a value. Strategies to handle this are: * (the most general way) replace the domain ‚ÑÇ of multi-valued functions by a suitable manifold in ‚ÑÇ√ó‚ÑÇ called Riemann surface. While this removes multi-valuedness, one has to know the theory behind it ; * restrict the domain such that a multi-valued function decomposes into separate single- valued branches, which can be handled individually. The following set of rules can be used to interpret formulas in this section correctly. If not mentioned otherwise, the following is assumed: Sectors Sectors in ‚ÑÇ having their vertex at z = 0 often prove to be appropriate domains for complex expressions. A sector D consists of all complex z fulfilling z ‚â† 0 and Œ± ‚àí Œ¥ < arg z < Œ± + Œ¥ with some Œ± and 0 < Œ¥ ‚â§ œÄ. Often, Œ± can be arbitrarily chosen and is not specified then. If Œ¥ is not given, it is assumed to be œÄ, and the sector is in fact the whole plane ‚ÑÇ, with the exception of a half-line originating at z = 0 and pointing into the direction of ‚àíŒ±, usually serving as a branch cut. Note: In many applications and texts, Œ± is silently taken to be 0, which centers the sector around the positive real axis. Branches In particular, a single-valued and holomorphic logarithm exists on any such sector D having its imaginary part bound to the range (Œ± ‚àí Œ¥, Œ± + Œ¥). Based on such a restricted logarithm, zs and the incomplete gamma functions in turn collapse to single-valued, holomorphic functions on D (or ‚ÑÇ√óD), called branches of their multi-valued counterparts on D. Adding a multiple of 2œÄ to Œ± yields a different set of correlated branches on the same set D. However, in any given context here, Œ± is assumed fixed and all branches involved are associated to it. If Œ± < Œ¥, the branches are called principal, because they equal their real analogons on the positive real axis. Note: In many applications and texts, formulas hold only for principal branches. Relation between branches The values of different branches of both the complex power function and the lower incomplete gamma function can be derived from each other by multiplication of e^{2\\\\pi \\\\mathrm{i}ks}, for k a suitable integer. Behavior near branch point The decomposition above further shows, that Œ≥ behaves near z = 0 asymptotically like: :\\\\gamma(s, z) \\\\asymp z^s \\\\, \\\\Gamma(s) \\\\, \\\\gamma^*(s, 0) = z^s \\\\, \\\\Gamma(s)/\\\\Gamma(s+1) = z^s/s. For positive real x, y and s, xy/y ‚Üí 0, when (x, y) ‚Üí (0, s). This seems to justify setting Œ≥(s, 0) = 0 for real s > 0. However, matters are somewhat different in the complex realm. Only if (a) the real part of s is positive, and (b) values uv are taken from just a finite set of branches, they are guaranteed to converge to zero as (u, v) ‚Üí (0, s), and so does Œ≥(u, v). On a single branch of Œ≥(b) is naturally fulfilled, so there Œ≥(s, 0) = 0 for s with positive real part is a continuous limit. Also note that such a continuation is by no means an analytic one. Algebraic relations All algebraic relations and differential equations observed by the real Œ≥(s, z) hold for its holomorphic counterpart as well. This is a consequence of the identity theorem , stating that equations between holomorphic functions valid on a real interval, hold everywhere. In particular, the recurrence relation and ‚àÇŒ≥(s,z)/‚àÇz = zs‚àí1 e‚àíz are preserved on corresponding branches. Integral representation The last relation tells us, that, for fixed s, Œ≥ is a primitive or antiderivative of the holomorphic function zs‚àí1 e‚àíz. Consequently, , for any complex u, v ‚â† 0, :\\\\int_u^v t^{s-1}\\\\,e^{-t}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t = \\\\gamma(s,v) - \\\\gamma(s,u) holds, as long as the path of integration is entirely contained in the domain of a branch of the integrand. If, additionally, the real part of s is positive, then the limit Œ≥(s, u) ‚Üí 0 for u ‚Üí 0 applies, finally arriving at the complex integral definition of Œ≥ :\\\\gamma(s, z) = \\\\int_0^z t^{s-1}\\\\,e^{-t}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t, \\\\, \\\\Re(s) > 0. Any path of integration containing 0 only at its beginning, otherwise restricted to the domain of a branch of the integrand, is valid here, for example, the straight line connecting 0 and z. Limit for z ‚Üí +‚àû=Real values Given the integral representation of a principal branch of Œ≥, the following equation holds for all positive real s, x: :\\\\Gamma(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty t^{s-1}\\\\,e^{-t}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t = \\\\lim_{x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\gamma(s, x) s complex This result extends to complex s. Assume first and . Then :\\\\gamma(s, b) - \\\\gamma(s, a) \\\\le \\\\int_a^b t^{s-1} e^{-t}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t = \\\\int_a^b t^{\\\\Re s-1} e^{-t}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t \\\\le \\\\int_a^b t e^{-t}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t where :z^s = z^{\\\\Re s}\\\\,e^{-\\\\Im s\\\\arg z} has been used in the middle. Since the final integral becomes arbitrarily small if only a is large enough, Œ≥(s, x) converges uniformly for x ‚Üí ‚àû on the strip towards a holomorphic function, Theorem 3.9 on p.56 which must be Œì(s) because of the identity theorem . Taking the limit in the recurrence relation Œ≥(s,x) = (s ‚àí 1)Œ≥(s ‚àí 1,x) ‚àí xs'' ‚àí1 e‚àíx and noting, that lim xn e‚àíx = 0 for x ‚Üí ‚àû and all n, shows, that Œ≥(s,x) converges outside the strip, too, towards a function obeying the recurrence relation of the Œì-function. It follows :\\\\Gamma(s) = \\\\lim_{x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\gamma(s, x) for all complex s not a non-positive integer, x real and Œ≥ principal. Sectorwise convergence Now let u be from the sector arg z < Œ¥ < œÄ/2 with some fixed Œ¥ (Œ± = 0), Œ≥ be the principal branch on this sector, and look at :\\\\Gamma(s) - \\\\gamma(s, u) = \\\\Gamma(s) - \\\\gamma(s, u) + \\\\gamma(s, u) - \\\\gamma(s, u). As shown above, the first difference can be made arbitrarily small, if u is sufficiently large. The second difference allows for following estimation: :\\\\gamma(s, u) - \\\\gamma(s, u) \\\\le \\\\int_u^{u} z^{s-1} e^{-z}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}z = \\\\int_u^{u} z^{\\\\Re s - 1}\\\\,e^{-\\\\Im s\\\\,\\\\arg z}\\\\,e^{-\\\\Re z} \\\\,{\\\\rm d}z, where we made use of the integral representation of Œ≥ and the formula about zs above. If we integrate along the arc with radius R = u around 0 connecting u and u, then the last integral is :\\\\le R\\\\arg u\\\\,R^{\\\\Re s - 1}\\\\,e^{\\\\Im s\\\\,\\\\arg u}\\\\,e^{-R\\\\cos\\\\arg u} \\\\le \\\\delta\\\\,R^{\\\\Re s}\\\\,e^{\\\\Im s\\\\,\\\\delta}\\\\,e^{-R\\\\cos\\\\delta} = M\\\\,(R\\\\,\\\\cos\\\\delta)^{\\\\Re s}\\\\,e^{-R\\\\cos\\\\delta} where M = Œ¥(cos Œ¥)‚àíRe s eIm sŒ¥ is a constant independent of u or R. Again referring to the behavior of xn e‚àíx for large x, we see that the last expression approaches 0 as R increases towards ‚àû. In total we now have: :\\\\Gamma(s) = \\\\lim_{z \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\gamma(s, z), \\\\quad \\\\arg z < \\\\pi/2 - \\\\epsilon, if s is not a non-negative integer, 0 < Œµ < œÄ/2 is arbitrarily small, but fixed, and Œ≥ denotes the principal branch on this domain. Overview \\\\gamma(s, z) is: * entire in z for fixed, positive integral s; * multi-valued holomorphic in z for fixed s not an integer, with a branch point at z = 0; * on each branch meromorphic in s for fixed z ‚â† 0, with simple poles at non-positive integers s. =Upper incomplete Gamma function= As for the upper incomplete gamma function, a holomorphic extension, with respect to z or s, is given by : \\\\Gamma(s,z) = \\\\Gamma(s) - \\\\gamma(s, z) at points (s, z), where the right hand side exists. Since \\\\gamma is multi-valued, the same holds for \\\\Gamma, but a restriction to principal values only yields the single-valued principal branch of \\\\Gamma. When s is a non-positive integer in the above equation, neither part of the difference is defined, and a limiting process, here developed for s ‚Üí 0, fills in the missing values. Complex analysis guarantees holomorphicity, because \\\\Gamma(s,z) proves to be bounded in a neighbourhood of that limit for a fixed z. To determine the limit, the power series of \\\\gamma^* at z = 0 turns out useful. When replacing e^{-x} by its power series in the integral definition of \\\\gamma, one obtains (assume x,s positive reals for now): :\\\\gamma(s, x) = \\\\int_0^x t^{s-1} e^{-t} \\\\operatorname{d}t = \\\\int_0^x \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (-1)^k\\\\,\\\\frac{t^{s+k-1}}{k!}\\\\operatorname{d}t = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (-1)^k\\\\,\\\\frac{x^{s+k}}{k!(s+k)} = x^s\\\\,\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-x)^k}{k!(s+k)} or :\\\\gamma^*(s,x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-x)^k}{k!\\\\,\\\\Gamma(s)(s+k)}. which, as a series representation of the entire \\\\gamma^* function, converges for all complex x (and all complex s not a non-positive integer). With its restriction to real values lifted, the series allows the expansion: :\\\\gamma(s, z) - \\\\frac{1}{s} = -\\\\frac{1}{s} + z^s\\\\,\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-z)^k}{k!(s+k)} = \\\\frac{z^s-1}{s} + z^s\\\\,\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-z)^k}{k!(s+k)},\\\\quad \\\\Re(s) > -1, \\\\,s e 0. When s ‚Üí 0: :\\\\frac{z^s-1}{s} \\\\rightarrow \\\\ln(z),\\\\quad \\\\Gamma(s) - \\\\frac{1}{s} = \\\\frac{1}{s} - \\\\gamma + O(s) - \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\rightarrow-\\\\gamma,see last eq. (\\\\gamma is the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant here), hence, :\\\\Gamma(0,z) = \\\\lim_{s\\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\left(\\\\Gamma(s) - \\\\tfrac{1}{s} - (\\\\gamma(s, z) - \\\\tfrac{1}{s})\\\\right) = -\\\\gamma-\\\\ln(z) - \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-z)^k}{k\\\\,(k!)} is the limiting function to the upper incomplete gamma function as s ‚Üí 0, also known as the exponential integral E_1(z).http://dlmf.nist.gov/8.4.E4 By way of the recurrence relation, values of \\\\Gamma(-n, z) for positive integers n can be derived from this result,http://dlmf.nist.gov/8.4.E15 :\\\\Gamma(-n, z) = \\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\left(\\\\frac{e^{-z}}{z^n} \\\\sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} (-1)^k (n - k - 1)! \\\\, z^k + (-1)^n \\\\Gamma(0, z)\\\\right) so the upper incomplete gamma function proves to exist and be holomorphic, with respect both to z and s, for all s and z ‚â† 0\\\\. \\\\Gamma(s, z) is: * entire in z for fixed, positive integral s; * multi-valued holomorphic in z for fixed s non zero and not a positive integer, with a branch point at z = 0; * = \\\\Gamma(s) for s with positive real part and z = 0 (the limit when (s_i,z_i) \\\\rightarrow (s, 0)), but this is a continuous extension, not an analytic one (does not hold for real s<0!); * on each branch entire in s for fixed z ‚â† 0.

Connection with Kummer's confluent hypergeometric function When the real part of z is positive, : \\\\gamma(s,z) = s^{-1} z^s e^{-z} M(1,s+1,z) where : M(1, s+1, z) = 1 + \\\\frac{z}{(s+1)}+ \\\\frac{z^2}{(s+1)(s+2)}+ \\\\frac{z^3}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+3)}+ \\\\cdots has an infinite radius of convergence. Again with confluent hypergeometric functions and employing Kummer's identity, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Gamma(s,z) &= e^{-z} U(1-s,1-s,z) = \\\\frac{z^s e^{-z}}{\\\\Gamma(1-s)} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{-u}}{u^s (z+u)}{\\\\rm d}u = \\\\ &= e^{-z} z^s U(1,1+s,z) = e^{-z} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-u} (z+u)^{s-1}{\\\\rm d} u = e^{-z} z^s \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-z u} (1+u)^{s-1}{\\\\rm d} u. \\\\end{align} For the actual computation of numerical values, Gauss's continued fraction provides a useful expansion: : \\\\gamma(s, z) = \\\\cfrac{z^s e^{-z}}{s - \\\\cfrac{s z}{s+1 + \\\\cfrac{z}{s+2 - \\\\cfrac{(s+1)z} {s+3 + \\\\cfrac{2z}{s+4 - \\\\cfrac{(s+2)z}{s+5 + \\\\cfrac{3z}{s+6 - \\\\ddots}}}}}}}. This continued fraction converges for all complex z, provided only that s is not a negative integer. The upper gamma function has the continued fraction : \\\\Gamma(s, z) = \\\\cfrac{z^s e^{-z}}{z+\\\\cfrac{1-s}{1 + \\\\cfrac{1}{z + \\\\cfrac{2-s} {1 + \\\\cfrac{2}{z+ \\\\cfrac{3-s}{1+ \\\\ddots}}}}}} Abramowitz and Stegun p. 263, 6.5.31 and : \\\\Gamma(s, z)= \\\\cfrac{z^s e^{-z}}{1+z-s+ \\\\cfrac{s-1}{3+z-s+ \\\\cfrac{2(s-2)}{5+z-s+ \\\\cfrac{3(s-3)} {7+z-s+ \\\\cfrac{4(s-4)}{9+z-s+ \\\\ddots}}}}} Multiplication theorem The following multiplication theorem holds true: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Gamma(s,z) &= \\\\frac 1 {t^s} \\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\left(1-\\\\frac 1 t \\\\right)^i}{i!} \\\\Gamma(s+i,t z) \\\\ &= \\\\Gamma(s,t z) -(t z)^s e^{-t z} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac 1 t-1 \\\\right)^i}{i} L_{i-1}^{(s-i)}(t z). \\\\end{align} Software Implementation The incomplete gamma functions are available in various of the computer algebra systems. Even if unavailable directly, however, incomplete function values can be calculated using functions commonly included in spreadsheets (and computer algebra packages). In Excel, for example, these can be calculated using the Gamma function combined with the Gamma distribution function. :The lower incomplete function: \\\\gamma(s,x) = EXP(GAMMALN(s))*GAMMA.DIST(x,s,1,TRUE) :The upper incomplete function: \\\\Gamma(s,x) = EXP(GAMMALN(s))*(1-GAMMA.DIST(x,s,1,TRUE)). These follow from the definition of the Gamma distribution's Cumulative distribution function.  Regularized Gamma functions and Poisson random variables  Two related functions are the regularized Gamma functions: :P(s,x)=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma(s,x)}{\\\\Gamma(s)}, :Q(s,x)=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(s,x)}{\\\\Gamma(s)}=1-P(s,x). P(s,x) is the cumulative distribution function for Gamma random variables with shape parameter s and scale parameter 1. When s is an integer, Q(s,\\\\lambda) is the cumulative distribution function for Poisson random variables: If X is a {\\\\rm Poi}(\\\\lambda) random variable then : Pr(X This formula can be derived by repeated integration by parts.  Derivatives  Using the integral representation above, the derivative of the upper incomplete gamma function \\\\Gamma (s,x) with respect to x is : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Gamma (s,x) }{\\\\partial x} = - x^{s-1} e^{-x} The derivative with respect to its first argument s is given byK.O. Geddes, M.L. Glasser, R.A. Moore and T.C. Scott, Evaluation of Classes of Definite Integrals Involving Elementary Functions via Differentiation of Special Functions, AAECC (Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing), vol. 1, (1990), pp. 149‚Äì165, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Gamma (s,x) }{\\\\partial s} = \\\\ln x \\\\Gamma (s,x) + x\\\\,T(3,s,x) and the second derivative by : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\Gamma (s,x) }{\\\\partial s^2} = \\\\ln^2 x \\\\Gamma (s,x) + 2 x[\\\\ln x\\\\,T(3,s,x) + T(4,s,x) ] where the function T(m,s,x) is a special case of the Meijer G-function : T(m,s,x) = G_{m-1,\\\\,m}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,0} !\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 0, 0, \\\\dots, 0 \\\\ s-1, -1, \\\\dots, -1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, x \\\\right). This particular special case has internal closure properties of its own because it can be used to express all successive derivatives. In general, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^m \\\\Gamma (s,x) }{\\\\partial s^m} = \\\\ln^m x \\\\Gamma (s,x) + m x\\\\,\\\\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} P_n^{m-1} \\\\ln^{m-n-1} x\\\\,T(3+n,s,x) where P_j^n is the permutation defined by the Pochhammer symbol: : P_j^n = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{l} n \\\\ j \\\\end{array} \\\\right) j! = \\\\frac{n!}{(n-j)!}. All such derivatives can be generated in succession from: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial T (m,s,x) }{\\\\partial s} = \\\\ln x ~ T(m,s,x) + (m-1) T(m+1,s,x) and : \\\\frac{\\\\partial T (m,s,x) }{\\\\partial x} = -\\\\frac{1}{x} [T(m-1,s,x) + T(m,s,x)] This function T(m,s,x) can be computed from its series representation valid for z < 1 , : T(m,s,z) = - \\\\frac{(-1)^{m-1} }{(m-2)! } \\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}^{m-2} }{{\\\\rm d}t^{m-2} } \\\\left[\\\\Gamma (s-t) z^{t-1}\\\\right]\\\\Big_{t=0} + \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(-1)^n z^{s-1+n}}{n! (-s-n)^{m-1} } with the understanding that s is not a negative integer or zero. In such a case, one must use a limit. Results for z \\\\ge 1 can be obtained by analytic continuation. Some special cases of this function can be simplified. For example, T(2,s,x)=\\\\Gamma(s,x)/x, x\\\\,T(3,1,x) = {\\\\rm E}_1(x), where {\\\\rm E}_1(x) is the Exponential integral. These derivatives and the function T(m,s,x) provide exact solutions to a number of integrals by repeated differentiation of the integral definition of the upper incomplete gamma function., App B For example, : \\\\int_{x}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{t^{s-1} \\\\ln^m t}{e^t} {\\\\rm d}t= \\\\frac{\\\\partial^m}{\\\\partial s^m} \\\\int_{x}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{t^{s-1}}{e^t} {\\\\rm d}t= \\\\frac{\\\\partial^m}{\\\\partial s^m} \\\\Gamma (s,x) This formula can be further inflated or generalized to a huge class of Laplace transforms and Mellin transforms. When combined with a computer algebra system, the exploitation of special functions provides a powerful method for solving definite integrals, in particular those encountered by practical engineering applications (see Symbolic integration for more details). Indefinite and definite integrals The following indefinite integrals are readily obtained using integration by parts (with the constant of integration omitted in both cases): : \\\\int x^{b-1} \\\\gamma(s,x) \\\\mathrm d x = \\\\frac{1}{b} \\\\left( x^b \\\\gamma(s,x) - \\\\gamma(s+b,x) \\\\right), : \\\\int x^{b-1} \\\\Gamma(s,x) \\\\mathrm d x = \\\\frac{1}{b} \\\\left( x^b \\\\Gamma(s,x) - \\\\Gamma(s+b,x) \\\\right). The lower and the upper incomplete Gamma function are connected via the Fourier transform: : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {\\\\gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac s 2, z^2 \\\\pi \\\\right)} {(z^2 \\\\pi)^\\\\frac s 2} e^{-2 \\\\pi i k z} \\\\mathrm d z = \\\\frac {\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac {1-s} 2, k^2 \\\\pi \\\\right)} {(k^2 \\\\pi)^\\\\frac {1-s} 2}. This follows, for example, by suitable specialization of .  Notes  References  * ¬ß6.5.  G. Arfken and H. Weber. Mathematical Methods for Physicists. Harcourt/Academic Press, 2000.

She is best known for her best-selling 1997 account of the Nanking Massacre, The Rape of Nanking. Chang is the subject of the 2007 biography, Finding Iris Chang, and the 2007 documentary film Iris Chang: The Rape of Nanking.  Early life and background  Iris Chang was the daughter of two university professors, Ying- Ying Chang and Dr. Shau-Jin Chang, who emigrated from Taiwan to the United States. Chang was born in Princeton, New Jersey and raised in Champaign- Urbana, Illinois. Chang grew up hearing stories about the Nanking massacre, from which her maternal grandparents managed to escape. When she tried finding books about the subject in Champaign Public Library, she found there were none. She attended University Laboratory High School of Urbana, Illinois, and graduated in 1985. She was initially a computer science major, but would later switch to journalism, earning a bachelor's degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1989. During her time in college she also worked as a New York Times stringer from Urbana-Champaign, and wrote six front-page articles over the course of one year. After brief stints at the Associated Press and the Chicago Tribune, she pursued a master's degree in Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University.Paula Kamen, \\"How 'Iris Chang' became a verb: A eulogy\\" Salon.com, November 30, 2004. She then embarked on her career as an author and lectured and wrote magazine articles. She married Bretton Lee Douglas, a design engineer for Cisco Systems, whom she had met in college, and had one son, Christopher, who was 2 years old at the time of her suicide. She lived in San Jose, California in the final years of her life.  Works  Chang wrote three books documenting the experiences of Chinese and Chinese Americans in history. Her first, Thread of the Silkworm (Basic Books, 1995). tells the life story of the Chinese professor, Hsue-Shen Tsien (or Qian Xuesen) during the Red Scare in the 1950s. Although Tsien was one of the founders of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and for many years helped the military of the United States debrief scientists from Nazi Germany, he was suddenly accused of being a spy and a member of the Communist Party USA, and was placed under house arrest from 1950 to 1955. Tsien left for the People's Republic of China in September 1955. Upon his return to China, Tsien developed the Dongfeng missile program, and later the Silkworm missile, which was used by the Iraqi military during its war on Iran and against the United States-led coalitions during Gulf Wars One and Two. The Rape of Nanking, Chang's most well-known work Her second book, The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II (1997),. was published on the 60th anniversary of the Nanking Massacre and was motivated in part by her own grandparents' stories about their escape from the massacre. It documents atrocities committed against Chinese by forces of the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino- Japanese War, and includes interviews with victims. The Rape of Nanking remained on the New York Times Bestseller list for 10 weeks. Based on the book, an American documentary film, Nanking, was released in 2007. The book attracted both praises for exposing the details of the atrocity and criticisms because of alleged inaccuracies. After publication of the book, Chang campaigned to persuade the Japanese government to apologize for its troops' wartime conduct and to pay compensation. Her third book, The Chinese in America (2003),. is a history of Chinese Americans, that argues their treatment as perpetual outsiders by American society. Consistent with the style of her earlier works, the book relies heavily on personal accounts, drawing its strong emotional content from their stories. She wrote, \\"The America of today would not be the same America without the achievements of its ethnic Chinese,\\" and that \\"scratch the surface of every American celebrity of Chinese heritage and you will find that, no matter how stellar their achievements, no matter how great their contribution to US society, virtually all of them have had their identities questioned at one point or another.\\"  Public notability  Success as an author made Iris Chang into a public figure. The Rape of Nanking placed her in great demand as a speaker and as an interview subject, and, more broadly, as a spokesperson for the viewpoint that the Japanese government had not done enough to compensate victims of their invasion of China. In one often-mentioned incident (as reported by The Times of London): > ...she confronted the Japanese Ambassador to the United States on > television, demanded an apology and expressed her dissatisfaction with his > mere acknowledgement \\"that really unfortunate things happened, acts of > violence were committed by members of the Japanese military\\". \\"It is because > of these types of wording and the vagueness of such expressions that Chinese > people, I think, are infuriated,\\" was her reaction.\\"I'm Sorry?\\" - Online > NewsHour, December 1, 1998. Chang's visibility as a public figure increased with her final work, The Chinese in America. After her death, she became the subject of tributes from fellow writers. Mo Hayder dedicated a novel to her. Reporter Richard Rongstad eulogized her as \\"Iris Chang lit a flame and passed it to others and we should not allow that flame to be extinguished.\\" In 2007, the documentary Nanking was dedicated to Chang, as well as the Chinese victims of Nanking. Iris Chang Park in San Jose, opening in November 2019, is a municipal park dedicated to Chang.  Depression and death  A bronze statue of Iris Chang at the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall in Nanjing Chang suffered a nervous breakdown in August 2004, which her family, friends, and doctors attributed in part to constant sleep deprivation, dozens of herbal supplements, and heavy doses of psychologically damaging prescription medication. At the time, she was several months into research for her fourth book, about the Bataan Death March. She was also promoting The Chinese in America. While en route to Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where she planned to gain access to a \\"time capsule\\" of audio recordings from servicemen, she suffered an extreme bout of depression that left her unable to leave her hotel room in Louisville. A local veteran who was assisting her research helped her check into Norton Psychiatric Hospital in Louisville, where she was diagnosed with reactive psychosis, placed on heavy medication for three days and then released to her parents. After the release from the hospital, she continued to suffer from depression and experienced the side effects of several medications she was taking.Heidi Benson, \\"Historian Iris Chang won many battles\\", San Francisco Chronicle, April 17, 2005. Chang was also reportedly deeply disturbed by much of the subject matter of her research. On November 9, 2004, at about 9 a.m., Chang was found dead in her car by a Santa Clara Valley Water District employee on a rural road south of Los Gatos, California and west of State Route 17, in Santa Clara County. Investigators concluded that Chang had shot herself through the mouth with a revolver. At the time of her death, she had been taking the medications Depakote and Risperdal to stabilize her mood. It was later discovered that she had left behind three suicide notes each dated November 8, 2004. \\"Statement of Iris Chang\\" stated: > I promise to get up and get out of the house every morning. I will stop by > to visit my parents then go for a long walk. I will follow the doctor's > orders for medications. I promise not to hurt myself. I promise not to visit > Web sites that talk about suicide. The next note was a draft of the third: > When you believe you have a future, you think in terms of generations and > years. When you do not, you live not just by the day ‚Äî but by the minute. It > is far better that you remember me as I was‚Äîin my heyday as a best-selling > author‚Äîthan the wild-eyed wreck who returned from Louisville. ... Each > breath is becoming difficult for me to take‚Äîthe anxiety can be compared to > drowning in an open sea. I know that my actions will transfer some of this > pain to others, indeed those who love me the most. Please forgive me. The third note included: > There are aspects of my experience in Louisville that I will never > understand. Deep down I suspect that you may have more answers about this > than I do. I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later > persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined.

As long as I am > alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. > Days before I left for Louisville I had a deep foreboding about my safety. I > sensed suddenly threats to my own life: an eerie feeling that I was being > followed in the streets, the white van parked outside my house, damaged mail > arriving at my P.O. Box. I believe my detention at Norton Hospital was the > government's attempt to discredit me. Reports said that news of her suicide hit the massacre survivor community in Nanjing hard.Kathleen E. McLaughlin, \\"Iris Chang's suicide stunned those she tried so hard to help\\", San Francisco Chronicle, November 20, 2004. In tribute to Chang, the survivors held a service at the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, around the same time as her funeral, held at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Los Altos, California on November 12, 2004. The Memorial Hall, which collects documents, photos, and human remains from the massacre, added both a wing and a bronze statue dedicated to Chang in 2005. In 2017, the Iris Chang Memorial Hall was built in Huai'an, China.

He directed a broad program of legal challenges to racial segregation and disfranchisement. He was also a journalist, novelist, and essayist. He graduated in 1916 from Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University), a historically black college. In 1918, White joined the small national staff of the NAACP in New York at the invitation of James Weldon Johnson. He acted as Johnson's assistant national secretary and traveled to the South to investigate lynchings and riots. Of multiracial, majority-white ancestry, at times he passed as white to facilitate his investigations and protect himself in tense situations. White succeeded Johnson as the head of the NAACP, leading the organization from 1929 to 1955. He joined the Advisory Council for the Government of the Virgin Islands in 1934 and resigned in 1935 to protest President Roosevelt's silence at Southern Democrats' blocking of anti-lynching legislation to avoid retaliatory obstruction of his New Deal policies. White oversaw the plans and organizational structure of the fight against public segregation. He worked with President Truman on desegregating the armed forces after the Second World War and gave him a draft for the Executive Order to implement this. Under White's leadership, the NAACP set up its Legal Defense Fund, which conducted numerous legal challenges to segregation and disfranchisement, and achieved many successes. Among these was the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which determined that segregated education was inherently unequal. White also quintupled NAACP membership to nearly 500,000.William Jelani Cobb, \\"Past Imperfect: Post Mfume\\", Afro-Netizen.com. Early life Walter was the son of George and Madeline White. By the time he was born, his father had attended Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University, still known as one of the South's historically black colleges) and became a postal worker, an admired position in the federal government.Dyja, Tom, Walter White: The Dilemma of Black Identity in America, Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, 2008, p. 12. His mother had graduated from the same institution and became a teacher. (She had been briefly married in 1879 to Marshall King, who died the same year.) White received a good education growing up. \\"He attended the Atlanta public schools, finished the Atlanta University high school in 1912, and the college there in the class of 1916. This period of study enabled White to spend eight years in the old Atlanta's unusual atmosphere at its zenith. There he was exposed to instruction which had been enriched by a decade of W. E. B. Du Bois' research. Undoubtedly White's life work reflected on the \\"Old Atlanta University's pioneer and still unequaled contributions in Southern colored institutions of higher learning.\\" The White family belonged to the influential First Congregational Church, founded after the Civil War by freedmen and the American Missionary Association, based in the North. Of all the black denominations in Georgia, the Congregationalists were among the most socially, politically and financially powerful. Membership in First Congregational was the ultimate status symbol in Atlanta. Of mixed race with African and European ancestry on both sides, White had features showing the latter. He emphasized in his autobiography, A Man Called White (p. 3): \\"I am a Negro. My skin is white, my eyes are blue, my hair is blond. The traits of my race are nowhere visible upon me.\\" Of his 32 great-great-great-grandparents, only five were black, and the other 27 were white. All members of his immediate family had fair skin, and his mother, Madeline, was also blue-eyed and blond.Walter White, A Man Called White: The Autobiography of Walter White, University of Georgia Press, 1995, p. 3. The oral history of his mother's family is that her maternal grandparents were Dilsia, an enslaved woman and concubine, and her master, William Henry Harrison. Harrison had six children with Dilsia and, much later, was elected president of the United States. Madeline's mother, Marie Harrison, was one of Dilsia's daughters by Harrison. Held in enslavement in La Grange, Georgia, where she had been sold, Marie became a concubine to Augustus Ware. The wealthy white man bought her a house, had four children with her, and passed on some wealth to them.Kenneth Robert Janken, Walter White: Mr. NAACP, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2006, pp. 2‚Äì4. White and his family identified as Negro and lived among Atlanta's Negro community. George and Madeline took a kind but firm approach in rearing their children, encouraging hard work and regular schedules.Dyja (2008), Walter White, p. 121. In his autobiography, White relates that his parents ran a strict schedule on Sundays; they locked him in his room for silent prayer, a time so boring that he almost begged to do homework. His father forbade Walter from reading any books less than 25 years old so he chose to read Dickens, Thackeray, and Trollope by the time he was 12.Dyja (2008), Walter White, p. 18. When he was 8, he threw a rock at a white child who called him a derogatory name for drinking from the fountain reserved for black people. Events such as this shaped White's self-identity. He began to develop skills to pass for white, which he used later to preserve his safety as a civil rights activist in the South. Career White was educated at Atlanta University, a historically black college. W. E. B. Du Bois had already moved to the North before White enrolled, but Du Bois knew White's parents well.Dyja, Walter White (2008), p. 15. Du Bois had taught two of White's older siblings at Atlanta University. Du Bois and Walter White later disagreed about how best to gain civil rights for black people, but they shared a vision for the country. (See Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems.) After graduating in 1916, White took a position with the Standard Life Insurance Company, one of the new and most successful businesses started by black people in Atlanta. He also worked to organize a chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which had been founded in 1909. He and other leaders were successful in getting the Atlanta School Board to support improving education for black children, who were taught in segregated schools, which were traditionally underfunded by the white-dominated legislature. (Black people had been effectively disfranchised at the turn of the century by Georgia's passage of a new constitution making voter registration more difficult, as did all the other former Confederate states.) Walter F. White, 1918 At the invitation of activist and writer James Weldon Johnson, 25-year- old White moved to New York City. In 1918, he started working at the national headquarters of the NAACP. White began as secretary assistant of the NAACP; Du Bois and other leaders got over their concerns about his youth. White became an undercover agent in investigating lynchings in the South, which were at a peak. With his keen investigative skills and light complexion, White proved to be the NAACP's secret weapon against white mob violence.Janken, Walter White: Mr. NAACP (2006), p. 57. White passed as white as a NAACP investigator, finding both more safety in hostile environments and gaining freer communication with white people in cases of violations of civil and human rights. He sometimes became involved in Klan groups in the South to expose those involved in lynchings and other murders. In the Little Rock, Arkansas, area he escaped on a train, having been harbored by several prominent black families because of threats that a black man \\"passing for white\\" was being hunted down to be lynched. The NAACP publicized information about these crimes, but virtually none was ever prosecuted by local or state southern governments. To become a popular leader, White had to compete with the appeal of Marcus Garvey; he learned to display a skillful verbal dexterity. Roy Wilkins, his successor at the NAACP, said, \\"White was one of the best talkers I've ever heard.\\"Dyja (2008), Walter White, p. 61. Throughout his career, Walter White spoke out against segregation and discrimination but also black nationalism. Most notably, White and Du Bois's 1934 conflict was over the latter's endorsement of black people's voluntary separation within US society.Janken (2006), Mr. NAACP, p. XIV. Marriage and family White married Gladys Powell in 1922. They had two children, Jane White, who became an actress on Broadway and television; and Walter Carl Darrow White, who lived in Germany for much of his adult life. The Whites' 27-year marriage ended in divorce in 1949.George Hutchinson, In Search of Nella Larsen: a Biography of the Color Line, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2006, p. 253. Because White was a public figure of a noted African-American rights organization, he generated great public controversy shortly after his divorce by marrying Poppy Cannon, a divorced white South African woman, who was a magazine editor with connections in the emerging television industry. Many of his black colleagues and acquaintances were offended. Some claimed the leader had always wanted to be white; others said he had always been white.Dyja (2008), Walter White, p. 181. Gladys and their children broke off with White and his second wife. White's sister said that he had wanted all along simply to pass as a white person. His son changed his name to Carl Darrow, signifying his disgust and desire to separate himself from his father. NAACP=Investigating riots and lynchings White used his appearance to increase his effectiveness in conducting investigations of lynchings and race riots in the American South. He could \\"pass\\" and talk to white people as one of them, but he could talk to black people as one of them and identified with them. Such work was dangerous: \\"Through 1927 White would investigate 41 lynchings, 8 race riots, and two cases of widespread peonage, risking his life repeatedly in the backwaters of Florida, the piney woods of Georgia, and in the cotton fields of Arkansas.\\"Dyja (2008), Walter White, p. 48. (Peonage was a new form of unpaid labor.) In his autobiography, A Man Called White, he dedicates an entire chapter to a time when he almost joined the Ku Klux Klan undercover. White became a master of incognito investigating. He started with a letter from a friend who recruited new members of the KKK.Walter White. A Man Called White, p. 54. After correspondence between him and Edward Young Clark, leader of the KKK, Clark tried to interest White in joining. Invited to Atlanta to meet with other Klan leaders, White declined, fearing that he would be at risk of his life if his true identity were discovered. White used the access to Klan leaders to further his investigation into the \\"sinister and illegal conspiracy against human and civil rights which the Klan was concocting.\\" After deeper inquiries into White's life, Clark stopped sending signed letters. White was threatened by anonymous letters that stated his life would be in danger if he ever divulged any of the confidential information he had received.Walter White. A Man Called White, p. 55. By then, White had already turned the information over to the U.S. Department of Justice and New York Police Department. He believed that undermining the hold of mob violence would be crucial to his cause. White first investigated the October 1919 Elaine Race Riot, where white vigilantes and Federal troops in Phillips County, Arkansas killed more than 200 black sharecroppers. The case had both labor and racial aspects. Black sharecroppers were meeting on issues related to organizing with an agrarian union, which white vigilantes were attempting to suppress. They had established guards because of the threat, and a white man was killed. The white militias had come to the town and hunted down black people in retaliation for that death and to suppress the labor movement. Granted press credentials from the Chicago Daily News, White gained an interview with Arkansas Governor Charles Hillman Brough, who would not have met with him as the NAACP representative. Brough gave White a letter of recommendation to help him meet people and his autographed photograph. Learning that his identity was discovered, White was in Phillips County briefly before taking the first train back to Little Rock. The conductor told him that he was leaving \\"just when the fun is going to start\\" because they had found out that there was a \\"damned yellow nigger down here passing for white and the boys are going to get him.\\"; see also \\"RACES: The Colored Man's White\\", Time Magazine, April 4, 1955. Asked what they would do to him, the conductor told White, \\"When they get through with him he won't pass for white no more!\\" \\"High yellow\\" was a term used at the time to refer to black people of mixed-racial descent and visible European features. White published his findings about the riot and trial in the Daily News, the Chicago Defender, and The Nation, as well as the NAACP's own magazine, The Crisis. Governor Brough asked the United States Postal Service to prohibit mailings of the Chicago Defender and The Crisis to Arkansas, and others tried to get an injunction against distribution of the Defender at the local level. The NAACP provided legal defense of the black men convicted by the state for the riot and carried the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Its ruling overturned the Elaine convictions and established important precedent about the conduct of trials. The Supreme Court found that the original trial was held under conditions that adversely affected the defendants' rights. Some of the courtroom audience were armed, as was a mob outside, so there was intimidation of the court and jury. The 79 black defendants had been quickly tried and convicted by an all-white jury: 12 were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death; 67 were condemned to sentences from 20 years to life. No white man was prosecuted for any of the many black deaths.Walter White, A Man Called White, reprint, 1995, p. 49, accessed April 12, 2008. Scottsboro Trial White's first major struggle as leader of the NAACP centered on the Scottsboro Trial in 1931. It was also a case that tested the competition between the NAACP and the American Communist Party to represent the black community. The NAACP and Walter White wanted to increase their following in the black community. Weeks after White started in his new position at the NAACP, nine black teenagers looking for work were arrested after a fight with a group of white teens as the train both groups were riding on passed through Scottsboro, Alabama.Dyja, Walter White (2008), p. 121. Two white girls accused the nine black teenagers of rape. Locked in a cell awaiting trial, the \\"Scottsboro boys looked to be prime lynching material: dirt poor, illiterate, and of highly questionable moral character even for teenagers.\\" The Communist Party and the NAACP both hoped to prove themselves as the party to represent the black community. Scottsboro was an important battle ground for the two groups.Pratt, Charles A., \\"Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\\". MA thesis. Western Michigan University. 1971, p. 6. The Communists had to destroy black citizens' faith in the NAACP in order to take control of leadership, and they believed that a Scottsboro victory was a way to solidify this superior role over the NAACP. Their case against the NAACP was easier, as White and other leaders were second in approaching the case after the International Labor Defense.Pratt (1971), \\"Walter White\\", p. 9. Ultimately, the differing approaches to the case demonstrated the conflicting ideals between the two organizations. To White, \\"Communism meant that blacks have two strikes against them: blacks were aliens in white society where skin color was more important than initiative or intelligence, and blacks would also be Reds which meant a double dose of hatred from white Americans.\\"Pratt (1971), \\"Walter White\\", p. 14. White believed the NAACP had to keep distance and independence from the Communist Party for this reason. Ultimately, the Communist leaders failed to consolidate their position with black people. White said: \\"The shortsightedness of the Communist leaders in the United States (led to their eventual failure); Had they been more intelligent, honest, and truthful there is no way of estimating how deeply they might have penetrated into Negro life and consciousness.\\"Pratt (1971), \\"Walter White\\", p. 11. White meant the Communist's philosophy of branding anyone opposed to their platform was their failure. He believed the NAACP had the best defense counsel in the country, but the Scottsboro boys' families chose to go with the ILD partly because they were first on the scene. White believed in capitalist America and used communist propaganda as leverage to promote his own cause in securing civil liberties. He advised white America to reconsider its position of unfair treatment because they might find the black population choosing radical alternative methods of protest.Pratt (1971), \\"Walter White\\", p. 15. Ultimately, White and other NAACP leaders decided to continue involvement with the Scottsboro boys since it was only one of many efforts they had.Pratt (1971), \\"Walter White\\", p. 17. In his autobiography, White gave a critical summary of the injustice in Scottsboro: > In the intervening years it had become increasingly clear that the tragedy > of a Scottsboro lies, not in the bitterly cruel injustice which it works > upon its immediate victims, but also, and perhaps even more, in the cynical > use of human misery by Communists in propagandizing Communism, and in the > complacency with which a democratic government views the basic evils from > which such a case arises. A majority of Americans still ignore, the plain > implications in similar tragedies.Walter White. A Man Called White, p. 33. Anti-lynching legislation White was a strong proponent and supporter of federal anti-lynching bills, which were unable to surmount the opposition by the Southern Democrats in the Senate. One of White's many surveys showed that 46 of 50 lynchings during the first six months of 1919 were black victims, 10 of whom were burned at the stake.Pratt (1971), \\"Walter White\\", p. 19. After the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, White, like Ida Wells-Barnett, concluded the causes of such violence were not rape of a white woman by a black man, as was often rumored, but rather the result of \\"prejudice and economic competition.\\"Pratt (1971), \\"Walter White\\", p. 20. That was also the conclusion of a Chicago city commission, which investigated the 1919 rioting; it noted specifically that ethnic Irish in South Chicago had led the anti-black attacks. The Irish were considered highly political and strongly territorial against other groups, including more recent white immigrants from eastern Europe. In the late 1910s, newspapers reported a decreasing number of southern lynchings but postwar violence in Northern and Midwestern cities increased under the competition for work and housing by returning veterans, immigrants and black migrants. In the Great Migration, hundreds of thousands of black people were leaving the South for jobs in the North. The Pennsylvania Railroad recruited tens of thousands of workers from Florida alone. Rural violence also continued. White investigated violence in 1918 in Lowndes and Brooks counties, Georgia. The worst case was when \\"a pregnant black woman [was] tied to a tree and burned alive after which (the mob) split her open, and her child, still alive, was thrown to the ground and stomped by some of the members.\\"Pratt (1971), \\"Walter White\\", p. 22. White lobbied for federal anti-lynching bills during his time as leader of the NAACP. In 1922, the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill was passed overwhelmingly by the House, the \\"first piece of legislation passed by the House of Representatives since Reconstruction that specifically protected blacks from lynchings.\\"Pratt (1971), \\"Walter White\\", p. 30. Congress never passed the Dyer bill, as the Senate was controlled by Southerners who opposed it. Black people were then largely disfranchised in southern states, which were politically controlled by white Democrats. At the turn of the 20th century, the state legislatures had passed discriminatory laws and constitutions that effectively created barriers to voter registration and closed black people out of the political process. White sponsored other civil rights legislation, which was also defeated by the Southern bloc: the Castigan-Wagner bill of 1935, the Gavagan bill of 1937, and the VanNuys bill of 1940. Southerners had to mount a major political and financial effort to take the Castigan-Wagner bill out of consideration and to defeat the Gavagan bill. White had become a powerful figure: segregationist senator James F. Byrnes of South Carolina said in session about the Dyer bill, \\"One Negro has ordered this bill to pass. If Walter White should consent to have this bill laid aside its advocates would desert it as quickly as football players unscramble when the whistle of the referee is heard.\\" White's word was the only thing that kept the bill before Congress. Although the bill did not pass the Senate, White and the NAACP secured widespread public support for the cause. By 1938, a Gallup poll found that 72% of Americans and 57% of Southerners favored an anti-lynching bill.Dyja, Walter White (2008), p. 149. White also contributed to creating alliances among civil rights activists, many of whom went on to lead in the movement from the 1950s. Attacks on Paul Robeson During the McCarthy era, White did not openly criticize McCarthy's campaign in Congress against communists, which was wide-ranging. American fears of communism were heightened, and the FBI had been trying to classify civil rights activists as communists. White feared a backlash that might cost the NAACP its tax-exempt status and end up with people equating civil rights with communism.Mark Newman, \\"Civil Rights and Human Rights\\", review of Carol Andersen's Eyes Off the Prize: The United Nations and the African American Struggle for Human Rights, 1944‚Äì1955, in 'Reviews in American History, Vol. 32, No. 2, June 2004, pp. 247‚Äì254, accessed April 12, 2008. White criticized singer/activist Paul Robeson, who admitted to pro-Soviet leanings. Together with Roy Wilkins, the editor of The Crisis, he arranged for distribution of \\"Paul Robeson: Lost Shepherd\\", a leaflet against Robeson, which was written under a pseudonym.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, Random House, 1989, p. 396. Literary career Through his cultural interests and his close friendships with white literary power brokers Carl Van Vechten and Alfred A. Knopf, White was one of the founders of the \\"New Negro\\" cultural flowering. Popularly known as the Harlem Renaissance, the period was one of intense literary and artistic production. Harlem became the center of black American intellectual and artistic life. It attracted creative people from across the nation, as did New York City in general. Writer Zora Neale Hurston accused Walter White of stealing her designed costumes from her play The Great Day. White never returned the costumes to Hurston, who repeatedly asked for them by mail.\\"Why you feel that I am not due any answer about my costumes?\\" Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Biography, p. 202. White was the author of critically acclaimed novels: Fire in the Flint (1924) and Flight (1926). His non-fiction book Rope and Faggot: A Biography of Judge Lynch (1929) was a study of lynching. Additional books were A Rising Wind (1945), his autobiography A Man Called White (1948), and How Far the Promised Land (1955). Unfinished at his death was Blackjack, a novel on Harlem life and the career of an African-American boxer. Awards and honors * 1927 ‚Äì White received the Harmon Award (William E.

According to the 2001 census, the parish of Hartington Town Quarter, which also includes Pilsbury, had a population of 345 reducing to 332 at the 2011 Census. Formerly known for cheese-making and the mining of ironstone, limestone and lead, the village is now popular with tourists. Architecture Notable buildings in the village include the market hall (formerly the site of a market), the 13th-century parish church of Saint Giles, and the 17th-century Hartington Hall. The prominent Bank House in the centre of the village was built by the former village mill owner, and in the past was used as the village bank. A half-mile (800 m) to the south of the village, on the river Dove, is the fishing house of the famous angler Charles Cotton. In the north of the village is Pilsbury Castle,Walking Britain website an 11th-century motte-and-bailey castle, that survives only as an earthwork. Near Hartington is the finest neolithic stone circle in the Peak District, Arbor Low. There are numerous ancient tumuli and cairns in the landscape around Hartington, probably dating from the Bronze Age. Hartington Mill, now a private house, stands by the River Dove. This was the local water mill for grinding corn. Attractions The village has a youth hostel at Hartington Hall, which serves two major National Cycle Network routes: the Tissington Trail and the High Peak Trail, which meet at nearby Parsley Hay. These trails pass just under one mile (1500 m) to the east of the village, and offer of off-road cycling and walking along old railway trackbeds through the Peak District National Park. Hartington signal box, on the site of the former Hartington railway station, and nearly two miles (3 km) from the village, has been renovated and converted into a visitor centre. A little south of the village, overlooking the Dove, stands Wolfscote Hill (388 m at ), a good viewpoint, now in the care of the National Trust. Three miles (5 km) to the south-west lies the small settlement of Hulme End, which marks the northern starting point of the Manifold Way, an tarmacked walk- and cycle- route following the route of the former Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway. History According to the English Place-Name Society the name of the village derives from the Old English for either 'Stags' hill' or 'hill connected with Heorta'.English Place Name Society database at Nottingham University Hartington was mentioned in the Domesday book as belonging to Henry de Ferrers and being worth forty shillings.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. p.745 The parish was originally quite large, and part of the hundred of Wirksworth. Hartington had four townships, known as the Town Quarter, Nether Quarter, and Middle Quarter, and Upper Quarter, which are now all separate parishes. These became separate civil parishes in their own right in 1866.Vision of Britain site They are marked on Ordnance Survey maps. Surnames that originate from this area include Heathcote. Hartington railway station on the Cromford and High Peak Railway was opened in 1899. Regular passenger services ceased in 1954, and the line through Hartington was lifted in 1964. Cheese The creamery in the village, often called the cheese factory, was founded by the Duke of Devonshire in the 1870s;About Derbyshire website it was one of the three sources of Stilton, and also produced its own unique Dovedale cheese and others such as Buxton Blue cheese.

Life Born in 124 BC, he was the uncle to Julius Caesar through Caesar's mother, Aurelia. In 92 BC he defended his uncle Publius Rutilius Rufus, who had been unjustly accused of extortion in Asia. He was on intimate terms with the tribune Marcus Livius Drusus, who was murdered in 91 BC, and in the same year was an unsuccessful candidate for the tribunate. Shortly afterwards he was prosecuted under the lex Varia, the law proposed by Quintus Varius Severus which was directed against all who had in any way supported the Italians against Rome, and, in order to avoid condemnation, went into voluntary exile. He did not return until 82 BC, during the dictatorship of Lucius Cornelius Sulla. In 75 he was consul, and excited the hostility of the optimates by carrying a law that abolished the Sullan disqualification of the tribunes of the plebs from holding higher magistracies; another law de judiciis privatis, of which nothing is known, was abrogated by his brother Lucius Cotta. Cotta obtained the province of Gaul, and was granted a triumph for some victory of which we possess no details; but on the very day before its celebration an old wound broke out, and he was injured suddenly. According to Cicero, Publius Sulpicius Rufus and Cotta were the best speakers of the young men of their time. Physically incapable of rising to passionate heights of oratory, Cotta's successes were chiefly due to his searching investigation of facts; he kept strictly to the essentials of the case and avoided all irrelevant digressions. His style was pure and simple. He is introduced by Cicero as an interlocutor in the De Oratore and De Natura Deorum (iii.), as a supporter of the principles of the New Academy. The fragments of Sallust contain the substance of a speech delivered by Cotta in order to calm the popular anger at a deficient corn supply.

Another breed, the Shih Tzu, has its English name derive from the same source as this breed's Chinese name which translates to \\"lion dog\\". The breed was favored by royalty of the Chinese Imperial court as both a lap dog and companion dog, and its name refers to the city of Peking (Beijing) where the Forbidden City is located. The breed has several characteristics and health issues related to its unique appearance. Because of its desirable characteristics, the Pekingese has been part of the development of designer crossbreeds, such as the Peekapoo (crossed with a poodle) and Peke-a-tese (crossed with a Maltese). The breed originated in Western China. Young Pekingese Pekingese Appearance Dark coated Pekingese Pekingese Pekingese Modern breeders and dog show judges seem to prefer the long-haired type over the more traditional spaniel-type coat. The Pekingese's flat face and large eyes are some of the breeds most obvious characteristics. The body is compact and low to the ground. Pekingese also have a muscular and durable body. The breed's unusual rolling gait may have been deliberately developed by breeding to prevent the court dogs from wandering in ancient times. Coat All breed standards allow a wide range of color combinations. The majority of Pekingese are gold, red or sable. Cream, black, white, tan, black and tan and occasionally 'blue' or slate grey have appeared in the breed. The latter often has poor pigment and light eyes. Albino Pekingese (white with pink eyes) should be bred cautiously due to health problems that have been associated with albinism. The Pekingese sheds a lot. A black mask or a self-colored face is equally acceptable in show dogs. Regardless of coat color, the exposed skin of the muzzle, nose, lips and eye rims is black. They require a lot of grooming.Sable Pekingese The Pekingese weigh from and stand about at the withers, however they can sometimes be smaller. These smaller Pekingese are commonly referred to as \\"Sleeve\\" Pekingese or just \\"Sleeves\\". The name is taken from ancient times, when emperors would carry the smallest of the breed in their sleeves. A Pekingese over 15 pounds is disqualified in the show ring. The Pekingese is slightly longer than tall when measured from the forechest to the buttocks. The overall outline is an approximate ratio of 3 high to 5 long. Health The Pekingese has a median lifespan of 11.4 years in a UK Kennel Club survey. The leading cause of death for Pekingese, as for many other Toy breeds, is trauma. Top leading causes of organ systems include neurologic and cardiovascular, e.g., congestive heart failure. When diagnosed early and successfully treated with medication, a Pekingese with this problem can expect to live many years. A heart murmur is a potential sign of a problem, and must be evaluated by a veterinary cardiologist. Very often, the problem does not surface until the dog is 6 or more years old, so it is very difficult to screen the problem in a pup. The other main problems of the breed are eye issues and breathing problems, resulting from its tiny skull and flattened face, and skin allergies (and hotspots). An especially common problem is eye ulcers, which may develop spontaneously. Pekingese may also develop keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) progressive retinal atrophy, along with glaucoma in which pressure is placed on the eye, leading to fluid drainage in the eye. The leading cause of this is improper development of the eye's filtration angles. The Pekingese should not be kept outside, as having flattened faces and noses can cause them to develop breathing problems, making it difficult for them to regulate their body temperature in overly hot or cold weather. Their long backs, relative to their legs, make them vulnerable to back injuries. Care should be taken when picking them up to give adequate support to the back: one hand under the chest, the other under the abdomen. Short legs give some Pekingese difficulty with stairs; older dogs may not be able to go up or down stairs alone. In an effort to address the breathing difficulties caused by the breed's flat face, the Kennel Club (UK) significantly changed the breed standard in October 2008, removing the clause that the \\"profile [should be] flat with nose well up between eyes\\" and adding instead that the \\"muzzle must be evident\\". This was in response to public opinion following the BBC programme, Pedigree Dogs Exposed. The breed standards of two other flat-faced breeds, the Pug and English Bulldog, were soon also changed. Care Keeping the Pekingese coat healthy and presentable requires daily brushing, and a trip to the groomer every 8‚Äì12 weeks. One important thing for new owners to remember is that dogs intended as a house pet may be kept in a puppy cut which requires less maintenance than a show cut. It is also important to remove foreign materials from the eyes daily, and the creases on the face to prevent sores (hot spots). It is also necessary to keep and maintain the fur in the buttocks of the Pekingese clean and well groomed as the area is prone to soiling. Due to their abundance of fur, it is important to keep the Pekingese cool. The breed is prone to have heatstroke when exposed to high temperature for a long time. Pekingese exercise needs are minimal. Due to their extremely short snouts, they tend to have a high risk for breathing difficulties (most notably Brachycephalic obstructed airway syndrome). Because of this, around 30 minutes of exercise per day is enough to keep them healthy. It is important to monitor their breathing while exercising, especially if they are in the heat. If the Pekingese begins wheezing, exercise should cease immediately. After running, they should spend time resting in a cool place until their breathing returns to normal. They should also have access to plenty of water before, during, and after exercise to prevent overheating and dehydration. History Pekingese, 1904 Chinese Spaniel, 1903 Chinese Happa dog from the 19th Century, an ancestor of the modern Pekingese, Rothschild Zoological Museum, Tring, England The breed originated in China and could only be owned by members of the Chinese Imperial Palace. During the Second Opium War, in 1860, the Old Summer Palace in Beijing was occupied by a contingent of British and French troops. The Xianfeng Emperor had fled with all of his court to Chengde. However, an elderly aunt of the emperor remained. When the British and French troops entered, she committed suicide. She was found with her five Pekingese. They were removed by the Allies before the Summer Palace was burnt to the ground.\\"The Letter\\", David Matthews, Jo Lee Magazine, Nov. 2002, p. 18\\" \\"This little dog was found by me in the Palace of Yuan-Ming-Yuan near Pekin on the 6th of October 1860. It is supposed to have belonged to either the Empress, or one of the ladies of the Imperial Family.

Lord John Hay took a pair, later called Schloff and Hytien, and gave them to his sister, the Duchess of Wellington, wife of Henry Wellesley, 3rd Duke of Wellington. Sir George Fitzroy took another pair, and gave them to his cousins, the Duke and Duchess of Richmond and Gordon. Lieutenant Dunne presented the fifth Pekingese to Queen Victoria, who named it Looty.Looty, Friedrich Wilhelm Keyl, 1861, oil on canvas backed on panel, 33.3 x 38.1 cm, Royal Collection, RCIN 40697. Painted at Windsor for Queen Victoria The Empress Dowager Cixi presented Pekingese to several Americans, including John Pierpont Morgan and Alice Lee Roosevelt Longworth, daughter of Theodore Roosevelt, who named it Manchu. The first Pekingese in Ireland was introduced by Dr. Heuston. He established smallpox vaccination clinics in China. The effect was dramatic. In gratitude, the Chinese minister, Li Hongzhang presented him with a pair of Pekingese. They were named Chang and Lady Li. Dr. Heuston founded the Greystones kennel. Around the turn of the century, Pekingese dogs became popular in Western countries. They were owned by such arbiters of fashion as Alexandra of Denmark (wife of Edward VII), and Elsie de Wolfe, popular American interior decorator. Later, they were owned by Rumer Godden, who wrote in her autobiography that \\"I do not like dogs except very large ones and one or two with such character that they cannot be denied; Pekingese are not dogs but something more\\"A Time to Dance, No Time to Weep by Rumer Godden, originally published by Macmillan 1987 and taken from page 109 of Corgi edition, 1989 and by Auberon Waugh, who on one occasion fancifully boasted that one of his dogs shared his love of The Daily Telegraph and hatred for The Sunday Times.\\"Top dogs\\", The Daily Telegraph, 23 March 1994, reprinted in the anthology Way of the World, Random House (Century) 1994 and taken from page 396 of Arrow Books edition, 1995 In recent years, their popularity has declined, eclipsed by similar breeds such as the Shih Tzu.Country Life magazine, 18 August 2018 Sleeve Pekingese White-cream Pekingese with black mask According to the 1948 publication Dogs In Britain, A Description of All Native Breeds and Most Foreign Breeds in Britain by Clifford LB Hubbard, the Sleeve Pekingese is a true miniature of the standard-sized dog, and was also known as the Miniature Pekingese. The name Sleeve Pekingese came from the custom of carrying these small dogs in the capacious sleeves of the robes worn by members of the Chinese Imperial Household. Hubbard indicated that this tradition appeared to be early Italian rather than Chinese, but its adoption by the Chinese Imperial Household led to dogs being bred as small as possible and to practices aimed at stunting their growth: giving puppies rice wine, holding newborns tightly for hours at a time or putting the puppies into tight-fitting wire mesh waistcoats. These practices were apparently forbidden by Dowager Empress Cixi. In Hubbard's time, the term Sleeve was applied in Britain to a miniature Pekingese no more than 6‚Äì7 pounds in weight, often appearing to be only about 3‚Äì4 pounds. Mrs Flander's Mai Mai weighed only a little over 4 pounds and many other breeders had bred true miniatures of a similar size. He noted that miniatures may appear in a litter bred from full- sized Pekingese and were exhibited in classes for dogs less than 7 pounds at the major dog shows in Britain. In 1946 (when Hubbard wrote his book), the Sleeve Pekingese had a strong following with the most popular colours being cream and white, with white being considered particularly attractive. He illustrated the description with a white Sleeve Pekingese bred by Mrs Aileen Adam.Hubbard, Clifford LB. Dogs In Britain, A Description of All Native Breeds and Most Foreign Breeds in Britain. Macmillan Books, 1948 Legends Pekingese puppy There are two origin stories for the Pekingese. The first is the most common, The Lion and the Marmoset: :A lion and a marmoset fell in love. But the lion was too large. The lion went to the Buddha and told him of his woes. The Buddha allowed the lion to shrink down to the size of the marmoset. And the Pekingese was the result. The second, less-common, originating story is The Butterfly Lions: :A lion fell in love with a butterfly. But the butterfly and lion knew the difference in size was too much to overcome. Together they went to see the Buddha, who allowed their size to meet in the middle. From this, the Pekingese came. Another legend says that the breed resulted from the mating of a lion and a monkey, getting its nobleness and coat from the former and its ungainly walk from the latter. Because the Pekingese was believed to have originated from the Buddha, he was a temple dog. As such, he was not a mere toy. He was made small so that he could go after and destroy little demons that might infest the palace or temple. But his heart was big so that he could destroy even the largest and fiercest. (Barbara Hambly's novel, Bride of the Rat God, was written from this premise, although Hambly denies knowledge of the legends.) In popular culture * Peg, from Lady and the Tramp, is a Pekingese.

The periods permit explicit calculations in cyclotomic fields connected with Galois theory and with harmonic analysis (discrete Fourier transform). They are basic in the classical theory called cyclotomy. Closely related is the Gauss sum, a type of exponential sum which is a linear combination of periods. History As the name suggests, the periods were introduced by Gauss and were the basis for his theory of compass and straightedge construction. For example, the construction of the heptadecagon (a formula that furthered his reputation) depended on the algebra of such periods, of which : 2 \\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{17}\\\\right) = \\\\zeta + \\\\zeta^{16} \\\\, is an example involving the seventeenth root of unity : \\\\zeta = \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{17}\\\\right).

A Gaussian period P is a sum of the primitive n-th roots of unity \\\\zeta^a , where a runs through all of the elements in a fixed coset of H in G. The definition of P can also be stated in terms of the field trace. We have : P = \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\zeta) / L} (\\\\zeta^j) for some subfield L of Q(Œ∂) and some j coprime to n. This corresponds to the previous definition by identifying G and H with the Galois groups of Q(Œ∂)/Q and Q(Œ∂)/L, respectively. The choice of j determines the choice of coset of H in G in the previous definition. Example The situation is simplest when n is a prime number p > 2. In that case G is cyclic of order p ‚àí 1, and has one subgroup H of order d for every factor d of p ‚àí 1\\\\. For example, we can take H of index two. In that case H consists of the quadratic residues modulo p. Corresponding to this H we have the Gaussian period : P = \\\\zeta + \\\\zeta^4 + \\\\zeta^9 + \\\\cdots summed over (p ‚àí 1)/2 quadratic residues, and the other period P* summed over the (p ‚àí 1)/2 quadratic non-residues. It is easy to see that : P + P^* = -1 since the left-hand side adds all the primitive p-th roots of 1. We also know, from the trace definition, that P lies in a quadratic extension of Q. Therefore, as Gauss knew, P satisfies a quadratic equation with integer coefficients. Evaluating the square of the sum P is connected with the problem of counting how many quadratic residues between 1 and p ‚àí 1 are succeeded by quadratic residues. The solution is elementary (as we would now say, it computes a local zeta-function, for a curve that is a conic). One has :(P ‚àí P*)2 = p or ‚àíp, for p = 4m + 1 or 4m + 3 respectively. This therefore gives us the precise information about which quadratic field lies in Q(Œ∂). (That could be derived also by ramification arguments in algebraic number theory; see quadratic field.) As Gauss eventually showed, to evaluate P ‚àí P*, the correct square root to take is the positive (resp. i times positive real) one, in the two cases. Thus the explicit value of the period P is given by : P = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{-1+\\\\sqrt{p}}{2}, & \\\\text{if }p=4m+1, [6pt] \\\\frac{-1+i\\\\sqrt{p}}{2}, & \\\\text{if }p=4m+3. \\\\end{cases} Gauss sums As is discussed in more detail below, the Gaussian periods are closely related to another class of sums of roots of unity, now generally called Gauss sums (sometimes Gaussian sums). The quantity P ‚àí P* presented above is a quadratic Gauss sum mod p, the simplest non-trivial example of a Gauss sum. One observes that P ‚àí P* may also be written as :\\\\sum \\\\chi(a)\\\\zeta^a where \\\\chi(a) here stands for the Legendre symbol (a/p), and the sum is taken over residue classes modulo p. More generally, given a Dirichlet character œá mod n, the Gauss sum mod n associated with œá is :G(k,\\\\chi) = \\\\sum_{m=1}^n \\\\chi(m) \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi imk}{n}\\\\right). For the special case of \\\\chi=\\\\chi_1 the principal Dirichlet character, the Gauss sum reduces to the Ramanujan sum: :G(k,\\\\chi_1) = c_n(k) = \\\\sum_{m=1; (m,n)=1}^n \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi imk}{n}\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{d(n,k)} d\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{d}\\\\right) where Œº is the M√∂bius function. The Gauss sums G(k, \\\\chi) are ubiquitous in number theory; for example they occur significantly in the functional equations of L-functions. (Gauss sums are in a sense the finite field analogues of the gamma function.) Relationship of Gaussian periods and Gauss sums The Gaussian periods are related to the Gauss sums G(1,\\\\chi) for which the character œá is trivial on H. Such œá take the same value at all elements a in a fixed coset of H in G. For example, the quadratic character mod p described above takes the value 1 at each quadratic residue, and takes the value -1 at each quadratic non-residue. The Gauss sum G(1,\\\\chi) can thus be written as a linear combination of Gaussian periods (with coefficients œá(a)); the converse is also true, as a consequence of the orthogonality relations for the group (Z/nZ)√ó. In other words, the Gaussian periods and Gauss sums are each other's Fourier transforms. The Gaussian periods generally lie in smaller fields, since for example when n is a prime p, the values œá(a) are (p ‚àí 1)-th roots of unity. On the other hand, Gauss sums have nicer algebraic properties.

After the surrender at Saratoga, John returned to England and was honorably discharged.Pennell, 3 Soon afterward, he eloped with Anna, a daughter of Sir Edward Bishop, a friend of his father. They emigrated to the United States, and settled at Hagerstown, Maryland. Shortly afterward, John entered the United States Army, and was sent to the Western frontier. He was sent on the Harmar Campaign of 1790,Griswold, 111, n5 and was severely wounded in St. Clair's Defeat of 1791.Griswold, 233 He was a lieutenant in the Legion of the United States,Griswold, 123 and helped build the United States forts in Fort Wayne. He commanded in succession, Fort St. Mary's (1795 - ), Fort Wayne, and Fort Dearborn. He was promoted to captain on 1 July 1797 and transferred to Fort Lernoult in Detroit. In Summer 1803, he was sent with his company of the 1st Infantry from Fort Detroit to Lake Michigan, where he completed Fort Dearborn before the close of the year, on the site of the future city of Chicago. He served as the first commandant of the new fort. Captain Whistler was recalled to Detroit in 1810. During the War of 1812, he was breveted to major, and served with his company until the end of the war in 1815.Kirkland, 151 After the war, he was appointed military store-keeper at Newport, Kentucky. In 1816, he was sent to Fort Wayne where he built the third fort there; having helped design the first two.

He was an advisor to four U.S. presidents, and later served two consecutive terms as president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1981‚Äì1993). He was the author of 160 scientific papers and co-author of the textbooks Earth and Understanding Earth. Press served on the President's Science Advisory Committee during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and was appointed by President Richard Nixon to the National Science Board. In 1977 he was appointed President Jimmy Carter's Science Advisor and Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, serving until 1981. Physics History Network Early life and career Born in Brooklyn, New York, Press graduated with a B.S. degree from the City College of New York (1944) and completed his M.A. (1946) and Ph.D. (1949) degrees at Columbia University under Maurice \\"Doc\\" Ewing. As one of Ewing's two assistant professors, (with J. Lamar \\"Joe\\" Worzel as the other) Press was a co-founder of Lamont Geological Observatory (now Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) in Palisades, N.Y. Originally trained as an oceanographer, Press participated in research cruises on the sailing vessels RV Vema and RV Atlantis. In the early 1950s, Press turned to seismology, co- authoring with Ewing and Jardetzky a seminal monograph on elastic waves in layered media. In 1957, Press was recruited by Caltech to succeed founder Beno Gutenberg as director of the Seismological Laboratory, a position in which he remained until 1965. The appointment was controversial in that it passed over both Hugo Benioff and Charles Richter, then the laboratory's senior professors, for a much younger outsider. Press' accomplishments in this period include the design of a long-period seismograph, and the first detection of the Earth's normal modes of oscillation (\\"bell ringing\\"), excited by the Great Chilean earthquake, a pioneering application of digital processing to seismic recordings. Press was also closely involved in the construction of a lunar seismograph, first deployed by the Apollo 11 astronauts (see Lunar seismology). Later career In 1965, Press moved to MIT as department head of Earth and Planetary Sciences, where, with significant support from philanthropist Cecil H. Green, he revitalized what had been an overly traditional geology department by hiring new faculty members. He remained at MIT until 1976, and during this time, his work included collaborations with Vladimir Keilis-Borok and Leon Knopoff on computer pattern matching techniques that could be applied to earthquake prediction. In 1976, Press became Science Advisor to President Jimmy Carter and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. In 1981 he was elected president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and was re-elected in 1987, serving for a total of 12 years. In 1996, Press co-founded WAG (the Washington Advisory Group, later known as the Advisory Group at Huron), a global consulting company with clients that included approximately 50 leading universities. WAG played a notable role all phases of the founding of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. Press chaired that university's international advisory committee until 2010. Press is the recipient of 30 honorary degrees. Named in his honor are Mount Press, which in the Ellsworth Mountains, Antarctica; and Osedax frankpressi, a species of whalebone-eating marine worm.

The sunbirds are a group of very small Old World passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Their flight is fast and direct on short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed most of the time. The splendid sunbird breeds in west and central tropical Africa. One or two eggs are laid in an oval suspended nest in a tree. It is a seasonal migrant within its range. Splendid sunbirds are 15 cm long, and have medium-long thin down- curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to their nectar feeding. The adult male is mainly glossy purple, with a dark green back and wing bar, and a crimson breast patch. The female is greenish-brown above and yellowish below. This species is a common breeder in wet savannah and woodland with oil palms Elaeis guineensis. The latter provide sap from the incisions made in the trunk to collect the liquid to make palm wine.

It is located in the city of Genoa and regional Metropolitan City of Genoa, on the Italian Riviera in the Liguria region of northwestern Italy. The original university was founded in 1481. According to Microsoft Academic Search 2016 rankings, the University of Genoa has high- ranking positions among the European universities in multiple computer science fields: * in machine learning and pattern recognition the University of Genoa is the best scientific institution in Italy and is ranked 36th in Europe; * in computer vision the University of Genoa is the best scientific institution in Italy and is ranked 34th in Europe; * in computer graphics the University of Genoa is ranked 2nd institution in Italy and 35th in Europe. The University of Genoa has a strong collaboration with the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), since its foundation in 2005. The University of Genoa is currently setting up a big project for a new Faculty of Engineering within the Erzelli Great Campus science technology park, in the Western side of Genoa. The contracts were signed in October 2018, the final project should be released in 2019, the construction works should start in 2020, and the new faculty should open in 2023. L‚ÄôUniversit√† di Genova firma il contratto per l‚Äôacquisto dei terreni di Erzelli Campus School of Humanities The University of Genoa is organized in several independent campuses located in different city areas. Notable buildings are the main University premises (Via Balbi, 5) designed by the architect Bartolomeo Bianco and built in 1640, the new complex in Valletta Puggia, built in the 1980s and 1990s and hosting the Departments of Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics, and the new seat of Facolt√† di Economia, realized in 1996 by refurbishing old seaport docks. The University's botanical garden, the Orto Botanico dell'Universit√† di Genova, occupies one hectare in the city center, just above the University's main building. University of Genoa also has a number of regional campuses in Savona, Imperia, Santa Margherita Ligure, Ventimiglia and La Spezia.  History  Already in the 13th century in Genoa there were Colleges which conferred degrees in law, theology, medicine and arts. The College of Theology was established officially in 1471 with a Papal Bull of Sixtus IV (Francesco della Rovere). Some years after dates the promulgation of a Statute of the College of Medicine by the Council of the Elders in 1481. In 1569, by a decree of the Senate of Republic of Genoa, the Colleges were incorporated into the schools run by the Jesuits. The Jesuits settled near the old Church of San Girolamo Del Rosso, and enlarged their premises by buying some land on which to house their College and schools. The building, which is now the main University premises, was designed by the architect Bartolomeo Bianco, and began to be used in 1640. After the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, a special Committee reorganized the various courses of study, dividing them in higher education (Canon Law, Philosophy, Civil Law, Theology, Logic and Metaphysics, Physics) and primary education (courses in Rhetoric, Reading and Writing). After the establishment of the French Empire, which absorbed the Republic of Genoa, higher education was subdivided into different special Schools: Law, Medicine, Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Commerce, Language and Literature, Chemistry. The University of Genoa was affiliated to the Imperial University of Paris. It was reinstated as a separate university in 1812. After the fall of Napoleon, the provisional Government of the Republic appointed a new Committee in charge of higher education, and at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 it was decided that the University of Genoa be entrusted to the Kingdom of Sardinia, enjoying the same privileges as those granted to the University of Turin. The university was closed owing to political disturbances between 1821 and 1823 and again between 1830 and 1835. In 1870, two first technical institutes of higher education were established: the Royal Naval School and the Royal School of Economic Studies, that in 1936 were absorbed by the Royal University of Genoa, becoming the Faculties of Engineering and Economics respectively. In the late 20th century, the university expanded rapidly, with new regional campuses. In 1996 some departments were established in Savona within a remodeled Army Barrack area. That campus hosts the Department of Engineering and also courses in Business. New laboratories have been made in Simulation, Logistics & Industrial Engineering, among others. In January 2001, an \\"Institutional Review of University of Genoa\\" was given by CRE Institutional Evaluation Programme. This evaluation, surveys taken and reports made, explain The University's current promotion of invitations to outside professorships and student body.  Organization  As of the academic year 2012-2013 the university is headed by a rector and it was divided into 5 schools, comprising a total of 23 departments: * School of Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Physics ** Department of Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry (DCCI) ** Department of Physics (DIFI) ** Department of Mathematics (DIMA) ** Department of Earth, Environmental and Life Sciences (DISTAV) ** Department of Computer Science, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering (DIBRIS) * School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences ** Department of Pharmaceutics (DIFAR) ** Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties (DIMI) ** Department of Experimental Medicine (DIMES) ** Department of Neurosciences, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology and Maternal-Fetal Medicine (DINOGMI) ** Department of Surgical and Integrated Diagnostic Sciences (DISC) ** Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL) * School of Social Sciences ** Department of Economics ** Department of Law ** Department of Science Education (DISFOR) ** Department of Political Sciences (DISPO) * School of Humanities ** Department of Antics, Philosophy and History (DAFIST) ** Department of Italian, Roman, Antics, Arts and Drama Studies (DIRAAS) ** Department of Modern Cultures and Languages * Polytechnic School ** Department of Computer Science, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering (DIBRIS) ** Department of Civil, Chemical and Environmental Engineering (DICCA) ** Department of Mechanical, Energy, Logistics Engineering and Engineering Management (DIME) ** Department of Naval, Electrical, Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering (DITEN) ** Department of Architectural Sciences (DSA)  Rankings  In the ranking of Italian universities, the University of Genoa is ranked 13th by ARWU, 18th by QS, and 18th by THE. The university is ranked 151-200 in Engineering - Civil and Structural in the QS World University Subject Rankings. Times Higher Education gave the university a rank of 150+ in the Law category in its 2020 list of subjects.  Students  Today the university has a student population of around 40,000, including both undergraduate and graduate students. The University of Genoa shares a branch campus of Florida International University in Miami, Florida, United States, in Genoa. The two universities mutually host students of either university's School of Architecture.

Snook's keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine on 17 April 1942. She was launched on 15 August 1942 sponsored by Mrs. Audrey Emanuel Dempsey, wife of Lieutenant James C. Dempsey who had been awarded the Navy Cross for heroism as commanding officer of the submarine S-27, and commissioned on 24 October 1942 with Lieutenant Commander Charles O. Triebel in command. Patrols=First patrol After shakedown training off the New England coast, Snook departed New London on 3 March 1943 and set sail for the Pacific. Following a 12-day stopover at Pearl Harbor, the submarine put to sea on 11 April and headed for the Yellow Sea and East China Sea for her first war patrol. Upon completion of mine planting in the Shanghai area, Snook continued on up the coast of China to the Yellow Sea. On the afternoon of 5 May, she sighted two freighters standing out of Dairen and took up the chase. She trailed both until after nightfall, then fired a spread of three torpedoes that quickly sank Kinko Maru. The lead freighter continued, unaware of the attack, until someone on the sinking ship sounded a whistle. At that point, the freighter began a series of frantic maneuvers to dodge two of Snook's torpedoes, then opened fire with her guns, forcing the submarine to withdraw out of range, returning shortly after and firing three torpedoes, one of which hit Daifuku Maru amidships and sank her. Snook then resumed patrol. Early on the morning of 7 May, Snook began quickly closing in on a convoy. Upon overtaking the enemy cargo ships, she launched four torpedoes, followed by three others five minutes later. The 4,363-ton cargo ship Hosei Maru was destroyed and several other ships possibly damaged. After destroying two armed trawlers in actions on 13 May and 16 May, Snook terminated her first patrol at Midway Island on 23 May. Second patrol Snook set sail from Midway Island for her second war patrol on 9 June and headed for the waters off the Ryukyu Islands. In the morning twilight of 24 June, the submarine closed on a six- ship convoy escorted by two destroyers, launched two torpedoes at a large tanker, and heard two hits as she went deep and rigged for silent running to avoid the patrolling escorts. Coming back up to periscope depth, she found a destroyer guarding the crippled ship and was prevented from a second try by overhead aircraft. Shortly before midnight on 3 July Snook made radar contact with another enemy convoy. Early the following morning, she fired a spread of six torpedoes, sinking cargo ships Koki Maru and Liverpool Maru and severely damaging Atlantic Maru. Snook returned to Pearl Harbor from her second patrol on 18 July. Third patrol Snook left Pearl Harbor for her third war patrol on 18 August and arrived off Marcus Island on 30 August to take reconnaissance photographs and stand lifeguard duty for the carrier air strikes of 1 September. Following the air strikes, the submarine resumed patrol and headed for the East China Sea where, in the early morning darkness of 13 September, she torpedoed and sank the 9,650-ton transport Yamato Maru. On 22 September, Snook intercepted and sank 715-ton Japanese cargo ship Katsurahama Maru departing from Dairen. The submarine terminated her third patrol at Pearl Harbor on 8 October. Fourth patrol Snook spent her fourth war patrol in a coordinated attack group with sister ships and in the waters off the Mariana Islands. On 29 November, the submarine sank the passenger-cargo ship with four torpedo hits, and the cargo ship Shiganoura Maru, as well as damaging an escort ship. Snook returned to Midway Island on 7 December and was routed on to Pearl Harbor. Fifth patrol On 6 January 1944, Snook cleared Pearl Harbor and headed for the western coast of Ky≈´sh≈´ and her fifth war patrol. While off the Bonin Islands on 23 January, the submarine torpedoed and sank the 3,120-ton converted gunboat Magane Maru. On 8 February, she attacked a 13-ship convoy, firing a spread of four torpedoes for three hits before diving to evade the escort ships. In this action, she sank the troopship Lima Maru, with the massive loss of life of 2,765 dead,(the 11th worst loss of life by ship sunk by a submarine in history), and heavily damaged the freighter Shiranesan Maru. On 14 February, she quickly sank freighter Nittoku Maru, with one torpedo hit amidships and, on the following day, sank cargo ship Hoshi Maru Number Two. On 23 February, while returning to Midway Island, she spotted an enemy convoy eight miles away, made a daring approach through a screen of 11 enemy escort ships, and fired five torpedoes, with two hits which sank the passenger-cargo ship, Koyo Maru. The submarine terminated her fifth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 6 March and continued to Hunters Point Navy Yard for a major overhaul. Sixth patrol On her sixth patrol Snook attacked and missed two freighters on 12 July, but found no other worthwhile targets, and returned to Midway Island on 14 August. Seventh patrol Snook's seventh war patrol was conducted in Luzon Strait and the South China Sea. After stopping at Saipan for repairs from 25 September to 4 October the submarine continued her patrol and contacted an enemy convoy on 23 October. She sank passenger-cargo ship Shinsei Maru Number 1, then evaded two escorts and resumed the chase, sinking the tanker Kikusui Maru with a torpedo which disintegrated the entire aft end. After again escaping the escorts, Snook returned and fired five bow torpedoes, sinking cargo ship, or \\"hell ship\\", , killing about 1,773 American prisoners of war (the 23rd worst loss of life by ship sunk by a submarine in history), one of the greatest losses of life in American maritime history. After rescuing a downed airman on 3 November, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 November. Eighth patrol Snook's eighth war patrol was conducted off the Kuril Islands from 25 December 1944 to 17 February 1945. Her only sightings during this patrol were two friendly Soviet vessels and a momentary contact with a small patrol craft. Final patrol Snook was lost while conducting her ninth war patrol, in the South China Sea and Luzon Strait. On 8 April, she reported her position to submarine and when she did not acknowledge messages sent from Tigrone the next day, it was presumed that she had headed toward Luzon Strait. On 12 April, she was ordered to take lifeguard station in the vicinity of Sakishima Gunto in support of British carrier air strikes. On 20 April, the commander of the British carrier task force reported that he had a plane down in Snooks assigned area, and that he could not contact the submarine by radio. Snook was ordered to search the area and to acknowledge the order. When she failed to make a transmission, submarine was sent to make the search and rendezvous with Snook. Although Bang arrived and rescued the downed aviators, she saw no sign of the missing submarine; on 16 May, Snook was presumed lost due to unknown causes. It is believed that she was sunk by kaibokans , CD-8, CD-32 and CD-52. It has also been suggested that Snook may have been lost in combat with one of five Japanese submarines which were also lost in April‚ÄìMay 1945. One candidate is the Japanese submarine I-56 (type B3) but it is just a hypothesis because it is not confirmed by a single Japanese source. Snook was credited with sinking 17 enemy vessels in her two and one-half years of active service. She earned seven battle stars for World War II service.

When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-2513 was fitted with six torpedo tubes in the bow and four C/30 anti-aircraft guns. She could carry twenty-three torpedoes or seventeen torpedoes and twelve mines. The complement was five officers and fifty-two men. Service history=Kriegsmarine Her keel was laid down on 19 July 1944 by Blohm & Voss of Hamburg. She was commissioned on 12 October 1944 with Kapit√§nleutnant Hans Bungards in command. Bungards was relieved on 27 April 1945 by Fregattenkapit√§n Erich Topp, who commanded the boat for less than two weeks. U-2513 conducted no war patrols. On 8 May 1945, Topp surrendered his command at Horten Naval Base, Norway. U-2513 was taken to Oslo on 20 May, then to Lishally, Northern Ireland, which she reached on 7 June. In August 1945, the U-boat was transferred to the United States. United States Navy A year later, August 1946, U-2513 began an extensive overhaul in Charleston, South Carolina, which was completed late in September. On 24 September, she departed Charleston and headed for Key West, Florida. The following day, she began six months of duty which included both evaluation tests of the U-boat's design and duty in conjunction with the development of submarine and antisubmarine tactics. The Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) would be initiated because of the results of these tests. On 21 November 1946 President Harry S. Truman became the second American President to travel on a submarine when he visited U-2513. The sub went below the surface with the President on board, and a demonstration was made to him of the German schnorchel (a specialized submarine snorkel).\\"Truman Dives 440 Feet In German Sub\\", The Pittsburgh Press, 21 November 1946, p9 On 15 March 1947, U-2513 headed north from Key West, Florida, bound for the New England coast, and arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 22 March. She remained there until 8 September when she began six weeks of operations out of Portsmouth and New London, Connecticut, under the auspices of the Commander, Submarines, Atlantic Fleet. She concluded that duty on 15 October and departed New London to return to Key West. U-2513 resumed her old duties at Key West five days later and continued them until the summer of 1949. In mid-June 1949, the submarine moved from Key West, Florida, north via Norfolk, Virginia, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she was placed out of service in July 1949. She remained at Portsmouth until August 1951 at which time she returned to Key West. On 2 September 1951, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered that the boat be sunk by gunfire. U-2513 was sunk west of Key West, Florida during rocket tests by the destroyer on 7 October 1951. The final resting place of U-2513 is about 23 miles northeast of the Dry Tortugas (70 miles west of Key West) in about of water at . She is reachable only by divers experienced in decompression diving at that depth. The site is rarely dived on due to its depth and remote location.

In mathematics 496 is most notable for being a perfect number, and one of the earliest numbers to be recognized as such. As a perfect number, it is tied to the Mersenne prime 31, 25 ‚àí 1, with 24 (25 ‚àí 1) yielding 496. Also related to its being a perfect number, 496 is a harmonic divisor number, since the number of proper divisors of 496 divided by the sum of the reciprocals of its divisors, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, 248 and 496, (the harmonic mean), yields an integer, 5 in this case. A triangular number and a hexagonal number, 496 is also a centered nonagonal number. Being the 31st triangular number, 496 is the smallest counterexample to the hypothesis that one more than an even triangular number is a prime number. It is the largest happy number less than 500. There is no solution to the equation œÜ(x) = 496, making 496 a nontotient. E8 has real dimension 496. In physics The number 496 is a very important number in superstring theory. In 1984, Michael Green and John H. Schwarz realized that one of the necessary conditions for a superstring theory to make sense is that the dimension of the gauge group of type I string theory must be 496. The group is therefore SO(32). Their discovery started the first superstring revolution. It was realized in 1985 that the heterotic string can admit another possible gauge group, namely E8 x E8.

It is native to tropical Africa, its range extending from Senegal and Guinea in the west to Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya in the east. Description Beautiful sunbirds are tiny, only long, although the breeding male's long tail adds another . They have medium-length thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both of which are adaptations to their nectar feeding. The male has a black head, bright metallic green upper parts, scarlet breast bordered with yellow and black belly. The central feathers of the teal are greatly elongated.

Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed most of the time. The beautiful sunbird is a common breeder across sub-Saharan tropical Africa. One or two eggs are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. It is a seasonal migrant within its range. Distribution and habitat The beautiful sunbird occurs in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda.

Mythology The manananggal is described as scary, often hideous, usually depicted as female, and always capable of severing its upper torso and sprouting huge bat-like wings to fly into the night in search of its victims. The word manananggal comes from the Tagalog word tanggal, which means \\"to remove\\" or \\"to separate\\", which literally translates as \\"remover\\" or \\"separator\\". In this case, \\"one who separates itself\\". The name also originates from an expression used for a severed torso. The manananggal is said to favor preying on sleeping, pregnant women, using an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck the hearts of fetuses, or the blood of someone who is sleeping. It also haunts newlyweds or couples in love. Due to being left at the altar, grooms-to-be are one of its main targets. The severed lower torso is left standing, and is the more vulnerable of the two halves. Sprinkling salt, smearing crushed garlic or ash on top of the standing torso is fatal to the creature. The upper torso then would not be able to rejoin itself and would perish by sunrise. The myth of the manananggal is popular in the Visayan regions of the Philippines, especially in the western provinces of Capiz, Iloilo, Bohol and Antique. There are varying accounts of the features of a manananggal. Like vampires, Visayan folklore creatures, and aswangs, manananggals are also said to abhor garlic, salt and holy water. They were also known to avoid daggers, light, vinegar, spices and the tail of a stingray, which can be fashioned as a whip. Folklore of similar creatures can be found in the neighbouring nations of Indonesia and Malaysia. The province of Capiz is the subject or focus of many manananggal stories, as with the stories of other types of mythical creatures, such as ghosts, goblins, ghouls generically referred to as aswangs. Sightings are purported here, and certain local folk are said to believe in their existence despite modernization. The manananggal shares some features with the vampire of Balkan folklore, such as its dislike of garlic, salt, and vulnerability to sunlight. Historical accounts \\"The seventh was called magtatangal, and his purpose was to show himself at night to many persons, without his head or entrails. In such wise the devil walked about and carried, or pretended to carry, his head to different places; and, in the morning, returned it to his body‚Äîremaining, as before, alive. This seems to me to be a fable, although the natives affirm that they have seen it, because the devil probably caused them so to believe. This occurred in Catanduanes.\\" Fr. Juan de Plasencia, Customs of the Tagalogs (1589) \\"Brujo. Magtatangal. Dicen que vuela y come carne humana pero cuando levanta el vuelo no lleva mas que el medio cuerpo y por eso se llma asi porque es de tangal que es desencajar y el tal desencaja la mitad del cuerpo y ese lleva consigo dejadose en casa el otro medio.\\" Magtatangal. A witch. They say that it flies and eats human flesh, but when it flies, it only has half its body, and that is why it is called tangal because it is tangible and can disengage and he dislodges half of his body, and he carries the other means at home.

Spearguns are used in sport fishing and underwater target shooting. The two basic types are pneumatic and those powered by rubber bands. Spear types come in a number of varieties including threaded, break-away and lined. Floats and buoys are common accessories when targeting larger fish. Components The basic components of a speargun are a spear, a stock or barrel, and a handle or grip containing a trigger mechanism. Spearguns are usually from long, round or roughly rectangular from in diameter/width. Types of spearguns Spearguns are, most often, divided according to propulsion method, with the two common variants being rubber (or band) powered, and air powered (Pneumatic). Band powered spearguns, which are the simplest and cheapest to maintain, with rubber being the predominant material, come in two types: those made from wood (often referred to as a Hawaiian sling), and those of sealed tubing metal or composite and/or a combination of these materials construction: referred to as the Stock or Barrel respectively.\\"Hawaiian Squid-Hook Sinkers and Sling- Stones\\", J. Edge-Partington, Man, Vol. 17. (May, 1917), pp. 79‚Äì80. Spearguns of the tubular barrel variety have separate \\"muzzles\\" fitting in or over one end of the tube, for attaching the rubber bands; while others (usually those made of wood), mainly have the bands passing through a horizontal slot in the stock. A rubber powered gun, besides the barrel, has the following parts: *A spear (being a steel shaft slightly longer than the stock/barrel of from in diameter, which lies on top of the barrel or in a track or groove on the top), and a trigger mechanism to engage the spear (usually in or near a handle or grip at or near the rear) to keep the gun in a loaded state of readiness when it is loaded. *Such loading is from one or more latex rubber bands (usually tubing) which provide the propelling force and are about one third of the barrel length and from in diameter, being attached to the front of the gun. *The ends of these bands have ‚Äòbridles‚Äô or 'wishbones', (which are usually metal or synthetic cord) fitted to them and when these bands are pulled by the diver to engage the 'wishbones' in notches in the spear or 'fins' welded on the top at the rear just before the trigger, the gun is loaded. A Pneumatic gun differs from a rubber model in that it has a thicker spear that goes inside a sealed internal barrel encased in a hollow sealed outer casing that contains the air which is at ambient pressure until it is pumped up by hand to a pressure usually equal to one strong rubber band. The trigger mechanism (which is at the back of the gun) has a handle/grip below it or midway up the gun. Once at the required pressure the spear is forced down the barrel to engage the trigger mechanism and is then loaded and ready. There will usually be a strong line at least twice the length of the gun connecting the spear to the front of the gun. When loaded great caution must be exercised as the speargun is now a dangerous weapon. Without a trigger, rubber bands or air pressure the speargun cannot be loaded and therefore cannot function. Uses of spearguns Spears and spearguns have various uses: *Sport spearfishing *In tropical seas, some natives spearfish for a living, often using a home-made snorkelling kit *As a weapon, as in the planned hijacking of Federal Express Flight 705 or murder * Underwater target shooting All spearguns have a trigger mechanism that holds a spear in place along the barrel. Traditionally, rear- handle spearguns are popular in Europe and mid-handle guns were used in North America, however as spearfishing has developed as an international sport these distinctions have blurred. South African speargun manufacturers have improved speargun designs with the use of a rail along the barrel that prevents the spear from flexing under pressure from the rubber bands. Accessories The speargun can have: *Buoy or float, tethered to the speargun or directly to the spear. It helps to subdue large fish. It can also assist in storing fish, but is more importantly used as a safety device to warn boat drivers there is diver in the area. *Floatline, connecting the buoy to the speargun. Often made from woven plastic, they can also be a mono-filament encased in an airtight plastic tube, or made from stretchable bungee cord. Spear shaft types=Threaded Threaded shafts allow for different tips to be used by having them screw on or off. Some tips include a basic short tip with a folding flopper and others use longer tips with a rotating feature, usually with multiple floppers. When larger fish are targeted a break-away tip is recommended (not to be confused with the break-away setup below) as it allows some portion, usually , of the tip to \\"break-away\\" from the main shaft after it penetrates a fish allowing the shaft to \\"fall out\\" of the fish but maintain the fish connection by either a small steel cable or high-strength spectra or kevlar line. Hawaiian Hawaiian shafts are the simplest shaft as the tip is shaped on the end and a folding barb installed directly behind the tip to keep the fish from sliding off. There are different length barbs and sometimes multiples (sometimes referred to as a Florida rig). Speargun setups=Line Rig In this setup, the most common, the speargun is attached to the shaft by a line. The line is usually a heavy monofilament ( test), spectra, or other spectra-like material (braided line) with 180‚Äì270+ kg (400‚Äì600+ lb) rating. The line wraps around the bottom or side of the gun upon loading and releases via a mechanical release or tension release to allow the line to travel with the spear after firing. There are typically two different methods of connecting the line to the spear shaft, either a slide ring that travels up and down the shaft to machined stopping points or via a hole drilled through some portion of the shaft (usually the rear). This is the most common method for taking fish by speargun and the majority of the other types of setups use the mentioned connection options to the shaft. Some newer setups offer an option to quickly attach line to, or disconnect from, a shaft making for a line or free shaft option on a single speargun. Speed rig Here the spear gun is connected to a buoy via a float rope. After spearing a fish, the spearfisher detaches the float rope and uses a speed stick (a metal spike) attached to the float rope to thread the fish onto the float rope through its gills. The fish will then gradually slide up the float rope as the diver swims until it rests underneath the buoy. When shooting larger fish, the diver can let go of his gun and play the fish from the float line, giving the fish more room to tire and preventing it from tearing off the spear or dragging the spearfisher under the water. Break-away rig Here the spear shaft is connected directly to the buoy. It is loosely fitted to the gun as well while hunting, but after the spear is fired its force of movement detaches the line from the gun. The spearfisher is then able to subdue the fish from the buoy or float line while retaining possession of his gun. This is for two reasons. Firstly, the gun can be used to push off sharks or signal the boat driver, and secondly to prevent loss of the gun should the fish break the line, or should the spearfisher lose grip on the buoy. This setup can be used in conjunction with elastic bungee-style rope and a body board style float with locking cleats. This respectively maintains constant pressure on the fish and allows the spearfisher to rest while being towed around. They can then gather the bungee line as the fish tires and lock it off in order to gradually pull the fish closer. Reel on gun Here the gun has a line reel like on a fishing rod. After spearing a fish, the reel unwinds, allowing the spearfisher room to play the fish. Reel setups are useful when ocean structures such as built up reef or kelp gardens prevent the spearfisher from towing a buoy. Free- shafting Here the spear shaft is not connected to a gun or buoy. This is more commonly associated with spearfishing on scuba where excess cable or line can be problematic. Also it can be used in the areas with exceptionally clear water, where underwater hunter can track his shaft after firing it. It is not used in turbid waters with poor visibility. Riding Rig Here, the spear shaft is connected to monofilament or other small high strength line, which is wrapped around the speargun, then connected to a larger, easier to handle rope which the diver holds in his hand. On the larger rope there is a loop on the end big enough for the divers thumb. The rope is placed on the thumb, then wrapped around the back of the hand. In this setup the spear is also totally free from the gun, allowing the diver to work the fish using the large rope, while keeping his gun safe. If the fish is too large to hang on to, the diver can tie it off or release it, only losing his spear and rope. This is used usually when fishing around oil rigs, or other hazardous diving such as hunting larger fish or in poor visibility.

It lies on a carboniferous limestone plateau known as the White Peak area. The monument consists of a stone circle surrounded by massive earthworks and a ditch.  Description  The monument includes about 50 large limestone blocks, quarried from a local site, which form an egg-shaped circle. There were probably 41-43 stones originally, but some are now in fragments. They range in size from , with monoliths of between . One stone is partially upright; the rest are all lying flat. Although it is often stated that the stones have never stood upright, it is possible that they had originally been set upright in shallow stone holes. In the centre of the circle lie at least six smaller blocks, originally believed to have been set in a rectangle, known as the cove. The stones are surrounded by a massive earth bank, approximately at the outside edges and high, with an interior ditch about 2 m deep and wide. There are two causeway entrances breaching both the bank and ditch; a north- west entrance wide, and a south-east entrance wide. The inner bank encloses an area of . Few henge monuments in the British Isles are as well preserved.  Finds  Human skeletal remains were discovered close to the cove during excavations between 1901 and 1902. Other finds have included flint scrapers, arrowheads, and bone and antler tools.  Surrounding landscape  A large Bronze Age round cairn or barrow was built later, to the east of the henge, using material taken from the earth bank. It was excavated in 1845 and found to contain a cremation burial, flint and bone artefacts, and two pots similar to Late Neolithic Peterborough ware now in the care of Sheffield City Museum. Arbor Low is part of a larger complex, and is linked by an earth ridge to the earlier Neolithic oval barrow of Gib Hill 320m away.  Construction and usage  The bank and ditch of the henge, as well as its two entrances, were probably established in the Late Neolithic period, with the stones added later, some time before 2000 BC. The site seems to have been in use until into the Bronze Age, which was when the outer bank was reconstructed so that the round barrow could be erected. Both the earthworks and the stoneworks are probably later than the nearby Gib Hill.  Statutory protection  Victorian area of statutory protection Arbor Low was one of the first ancient monuments to be given statutory protection, on 18 August 1882. Small stone markers engraved VR and GR (for Victoria Regina and Georgius Rex) still stand around the henge, demarcating the protected area.  Access  The henge stands on private farmland, but is accessible to the public. As of September 2020, an entrance fee of ¬£1 per adult is requested. Children can enter free of charge.

Tropical climates are characterized by monthly average temperatures of 18 ‚ÑÉ (64.4 ‚Ñâ) or higher year-round and feature hot temperatures. Annual precipitation is often abundant in tropical climates, and shows a seasonal rhythm to varying degrees. There are normally only two seasons in tropical climates, a wet season and a dry season. The annual temperature range in tropical climates is normally very small. Sunlight is intense. There are three basic types of tropical climates within the tropical climate group: tropical rainforest climate (Af), tropical monsoon climate (Am) and tropical wet and dry or savanna climate (Aw or As), which are classified and distinguished by the annual precipitation and the precipitation level of the driest month in those regions.  K√∂ppen climate classification  K√∂ppen climate classification is one of the most widely used climate classification systems. It defines a tropical climate as a region where the mean temperature of the coldest month is greater than or equal to 19 ‚ÑÉ (64.4 ‚Ñâ) and classifies them as an A-group (tropical climate group). A-group regions are usually found below 25 latitude in both the southern and northern hemisphere; they include areas around the Equator, Central America and parts of south America, central Africa, southern portions of Asia and parts of Australia and the Pacific Ocean islands. In Group A, there are three types of climate: tropical rainforest climate (Af), tropical monsoon climate (Am) and tropical wet and dry or savanna climate (Aw or As). All of the three climates are classified by their Pdry (short for precipitation of the driest month). Tropical rainforest climate‚Äôs Pdry should be greater or equal than 60 mm (2.4 inches). Tropical monsoon climate‚Äôs Pdry should be in the range from 100 - \\\\tfrac{mean\\\\ annual\\\\ precipitation}{25}to 60 mm. Tropical wet and dry or savanna climate‚Äôs Pdry should be less than 100 - \\\\tfrac{mean\\\\ annual\\\\ precipitation}{25}. Tropical Rainforest Climate Region  Tropical climate biome  Tropical climates normally have only two seasons, a wet season and a dry season. Depending on the location of the region, the wet and dry seasons are a varying duration. Annual temperature changes in the tropics are small. Due to the high temperature and abundant rainfall, much of the plant life grows throughout the year. High temperature and humidity is the most suitable environment for epiphytes to grow. In many tropical climates, vegetation grow in layers: shrubs under tall trees, and bushes under shrubs. Tropical plants are rich in resources, including coffee, cocoa and oil palm. Listed below are types of vegetation unique to each of the three climates that make up the tropical climate biome.  Natural vegetation  Tropical rainforest vegetation including: Bengal bamboo, bougainvillea, curare, coconut tree, Durian, Banana Tropical monsoon vegetation including: teak, deodar, rosewood, sandalwood and bamboo Tropical wet and dry or savanna vegetation including: acacia senegal, elephant grass, jarrah tree, gum tree eucalyptus, whistling thorn  Tropical rainforest climate  The K√∂ppen classification identifies tropical rainforest climate (Zone Af: f = feucht, German for moist) as having north and south latitudinal ranges of 5-10 degrees from the equator. Tropical rainforest climates have high temperatures: the yearly average temperature is between 21 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C ( 70 ¬∞F to 85 ¬∞F ). The precipitation can reach over 100 inches a year. The seasons are evenly distributed throughout the year, and there is almost no drought period. Regions affected by tropical rainforest climate mainly include the upper Amazon basin of South America, the Northern Zaire (Congo) basin of Africa, and the islands of the East Indies. The tropical rainforest climate differs from other subtypes of tropical climates as it has more kinds of trees. The large number of trees contribute to the humidity of the climate because of the transpiration, which is the process of water lost from the surface of living plants to the atmosphere. The warmth and abundant precipitation contributes to the diversity and characteristics of vegetations under the tropical rainforest climate. The vegetations develop a vertical stratification and various growth forms to receive enough sunlight, which is unusual under other types of climate.  Tropical monsoon climate  The K√∂ppen classification tool identifies tropical monsoon climate as having small annual temperature ranges, high temperatures, and plentiful precipitation. This climate also has a short dry season which occurs in the winter. The tropical monsoon climate is usually found within countries in the south and southeast Asia region between the latitude of 10 degrees north and the Tropic of Cancer. These regions include India, Philippines, the northern coast of Australia and Hainan Island of China. The annual temperature of regions under tropical monsoon climate is stable. The tropical monsoon climate has the following main characteristic. The average annual temperature is and has an annual temperature range of 3.6¬∞C (2¬∞F). Distinction between wet and drought seasons, the tropical monsoon climate is different from other tropical climates because of its uneven precipitation throughout the year. The precipitation is heavy in the summer, and a short-drought season occurs in the winter. This climate has an annual total precipitation of 3409.2mm, and a 3115.9mm summer precipitation and 293.3mm winter precipitation. There are three main seasons of tropical monsoon climate: the cool dry season is from October to February, the hot dry season is from March to mid-June and the rainy season is from mid-June to September. The tropical monsoon forest mainly consists of three layered structures. The first layer is the ground layer which is a very dense layer of shrubs. The second layer is the understory layer with trees about 15 meters tall. The top layer is called the canopy tree which has trees from 25 to 30 meters tall and those trees grow closely.  Tropical wet and dry or forest climate  Tropical savanna climates are mainly located between 10¬∞ and 20¬∞ north-south latitude, and often occur at the outer margins of the tropics. Typical regions include central Africa, parts of South America, as well as northern and eastern Australia. The temperature range of savanna climate is between 20 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F - 86 ¬∞F). In summer, the temperature is between 25 ¬∞C - 30 ¬∞C, while in winter the temperature is between 20 ¬∞C - 30 ¬∞C. The annual precipitation is between 700 to 1000 mm. The driest months are from November to March and they have less than 60 mm of rainfall. Regions under the savanna climate usually have lands covered with flat grassland vegetation. Those grassland biomes cover almost 20% of the earth‚Äôs surface. The grassland vegetation types include Rhodes grass, red oats grass, star grass and lemongrass.

Life  Maybaum was born in Vienna in 1897. He studied in Berlin at the Hochschule f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judentums, where he was ordained as a rabbi in 1926. He took rabbinic posts in Bingen, Frankfurt an der Oder and Berlin. He was a disciple of Franz Rosenzweig. In 1935 he was arrested by the Gestapo, spending six weeks in prison before being released. Leaving Germany in 1938, Maybaum was given work in the United Synagogue by the British Chief Rabbi, Joseph Hertz. His mother and sisters were killed in the Holocaust. In 1949 he became rabbi of Edgware and District Reform Synagogue. From 1956 until his retirement in 1963, he lectured in homiletics and theology at Leo Baeck College. He was also active in inter- religious dialogue. His students include Nicholas de Lange.  Holocaust theology  Maybaum wrote many reflections on Judaism, Christianity, the Holocaust and Zionism. He also wrote on Islam. He is most frequently remembered for his controversial view in The Face of God After Auschwitz (1965) that the suffering of Jews in the Holocaust was vicarious atonement for the sins of the rest of the world. He was connecting the Jewish people to the figure of the \\"suffering servant\\" of Isaiah 52 and 53 in the Tanakh (the Christian Old Testament). In the same work he employed Christian imagery, speaking of Auschwitz as the new Golgotha and the gas chambers as replacing the cross.

He was a team captain on Shooting Stars from 1995 to 1997, and hosted Never Mind the Buzzcocks from 1996 to 2005. Early life Lamarr was born in the Park South area of Swindon, Wiltshire. He has three elder sisters. His father is Irish. He passed five O-Levels at Park School (renamed Oakfield School) but dropped out of school at 17 and moved to Harrow, London, which was the centre of the early 1980s British rockabilly revival scene. After his poem Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Work was published in 1987, his act developed from poetry to stand-up comedy. He took to performing at London's Comedy Store in 1985, was spotted on the touring circuit for the launch of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast in 1992 and co-presented The Word. Career=Television Lamarr first came to the public's attention as a co-presenter of the early 1990s late night variety show The Word. The magazine format of the series allowed for interviews, live music, features and even game shows. The flexible late-night format meant that guests could do just about anything to be controversial. Talking about his TV career to Jo Brown of Cheers Magazine, Lamarr said The Word was: After leaving The Word, Lamarr was an outside presenter on The Big Breakfast from 1992 to 1996. Between 1995 and 1997 he appeared as a team captain in the surreal panel show Shooting Stars, where he displayed a mixture of dour boredom and contempt towards hosts Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer who, in turn, mocked his \\"50s throw-back\\" appearance. Lamarr declined to return for the fourth series in 2002, claiming he did not want to be typecast for appearing on panel shows. He said of his experience on the show: Lamarr was host of Never Mind the Buzzcocks when the show launched in 1996 and continued in this role for 17 series until 2005. Under Lamarr, the show gained a reputation for scornful treatment of the boy bands and the pop music that had dominated the music scene since the early 1990s, a position that was maintained by his successor. Although Lamarr initially intended to return to Buzzcocks after one series away, he was ultimately replaced by Simon Amstell from the 19th series. The second series of the sitcom 15 Storeys High was co-written by Lamarr with comedians Sean Lock and Martin Trenaman, although Lamarr was credited under his original name, Mark Jones. Radio Lamarr has previously presented shows on BBC GLR, BBC Radio 5 and BBC Radio 1. He also often guest presented the late night BBC Radio 2 show, sitting in for Mark Radcliffe. On 20 July 1998, Lamarr launched a new show on BBC Radio 2 called Shake, Rattle and Roll, where he played tracks from his own sizeable record collection of obscure rock and roll gems. He also presented The Reggae Show series and Mark Lamarr's Alternative Sixties, playing lesser known tracks from the 1960s. On 22 April 2006, Lamarr started a new Radio 2 show called God's Jukebox. The show aired from midnight to 3.00am on Saturdays and featured a wide variety of music from the previous 70 years including soul, ska, reggae, country, gospel and rap. He also, with Jo Brand, regularly covered the Jonathan Ross Saturday morning show on Radio 2 when Ross was away. His final God's Jukebox show was broadcast on Christmas Eve/Day, 2010. At the end of 2010 Lamarr left Radio 2, claiming the station had lost interest in non-mainstream music. Lamarr presented a music show for British Airways on- board listeners as part of their in-flight entertainment.

Although massive sodalite samples are opaque, crystals are usually transparent to translucent. Sodalite is a member of the sodalite group with hauyne, nosean, lazurite and tugtupite. First discovered by Europeans in 1811 in the Ilimaussaq intrusive complex in Greenland, sodalite did not become important as an ornamental stone until 1891 when vast deposits of fine material were discovered in Ontario, Canada.  Structure  Sodalite is a cubic mineral which consists of an aluminosilicate cage network with Na+ cations in the interframework. This framework forms a cage structure, similar to zeolites. Each unit cell contains two cage structures. Natural sodalite holds primarily chloride anions in the cages, but they can be substituted by other anions such as sulfate, sulfide, hydroxide, trisulfur with other minerals in the sodalite group representing end member compositions.  Properties  A sample of sodalite-carbonate pegmatite from Bolivia, with a polished rock surface. A light, relatively hard yet fragile mineral, sodalite is named after its sodium content; in mineralogy it may be classed as a feldspathoid. Well known for its blue color, sodalite may also be grey, yellow, green, or pink and is often mottled with white veins or patches. The more uniformly blue material is used in jewellery, where it is fashioned into cabochons and beads. Lesser material is more often seen as facing or inlay in various applications. Although somewhat similar to lazurite and lapis lazuli, sodalite rarely contains pyrite (a common inclusion in lapis) and its blue color is more like traditional royal blue rather than ultramarine. It is further distinguished from similar minerals by its white (rather than blue) streak. Sodalite's six directions of poor cleavage may be seen as incipient cracks running through the stone. Most sodalite will fluoresce orange under ultraviolet light, and hackmanite exhibits tenebrescence.Rock Roles: Facts, Properties, and Lore of Gemstones By Suzanne Bettonville. p.98  Hackmanite  Hackmanite dodecahedron from the Koksha Valley, Afghanistan Hackmanite is a variety of sodalite exhibiting tenebrescence. When hackmanite from Mont Saint- Hilaire (Quebec) or Il√≠maussaq (Greenland) is freshly quarried, it is generally pale to deep violet but the color fades quickly to greyish or greenish white. Conversely, hackmanite from Afghanistan and the Myanmar Republic (Burma) starts off creamy white but develops a violet to pink-red color in sunlight. If left in a dark environment for some time, the violet will fade again. Tenebrescence is accelerated by the use of longwave or, particularly, shortwave ultraviolet light. Much sodalite will also fluoresce a patchy orange under UV light.  Occurrence  Sodalite was first described in 1811 for the occurrence in its type locality in the Ilimaussaq complex, Narsaq, West Greenland. Occurring typically in massive form, sodalite is found as vein fillings in plutonic igneous rocks such as nepheline syenites. It is associated with other minerals typical of silica-undersaturated environments, namely leucite, cancrinite and natrolite. Other associated minerals include nepheline, titanian andradite, aegirine, microcline, sanidine, albite, calcite, fluorite, ankerite and baryte. Significant deposits of fine material are restricted to but a few locales: Bancroft, Ontario, and Mont-Saint- Hilaire, Quebec, in Canada; and Litchfield, Maine, and Magnet Cove, Arkansas, in the US. The Ice River complex, near Golden, British Columbia, contains sodalite.Ice River deposit on Mindat Smaller deposits are found in South America (Brazil and Bolivia), Portugal, Romania, Burma and Russia. Hackmanite is found principally in Mont-Saint-Hilaire and Greenland. Euhedral, transparent crystals are found in northern Namibia and in the lavas of Vesuvius, Italy. History The people of the Caral culture traded for sodalite from the Collao altiplano.The Chinchorro culture: a comparative perspective. The archaeology of the earliest human mummification. By Sanz, Nuria, Arriaza, Bernardo T., Standen, Vivien G., editors. p.92 Sodalite was also traded for at Lukurmata.Ancient Titicaca: The Evolution of Complex Society in Southern Peru and North Bolivia, by Charles Stanish, p.162 Synthesis The mesoporous cage structure of sodalite makes it useful as a container material for many anions. Some of the anions known to have been included in sodalite-structure materials include nitrate, iodide, iodate, permanganate, perchlorate, and perrhenate.

It was often depicted in religious iconography as a figure holding attributes such as a cornucopia, patera (libation bowl) or snake. Many Roman altars found throughout the Western Roman Empire were dedicated to a particular genius loci. The Roman imperial cults of the Emperor and the imperial house developed in part in connections with the sacrifices made by neighborhood associations (vici) to the local genius. These 265 local districtsNumber is for the city of Rome, cf. Plin. Nat. Hist. III, 66 had their cult organised around the Lares Compitales (guardian spirits or lares of the crossroads), which the emperor Augustus transformed into Lares Augusti along with the Genius Augusti.Woolf, Greg. (2008). \\"Divinity and Power in Ancient Rome\\" in Religion and Power: Divine Kingship in the Ancient World and Beyond. Nicole Brisch (ed.)(Oriental Institute Seminars No. 4), Chicago: The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. The emperor's genius is then regarded as the genius loci of the Roman Empire as a whole. Roman examples of these Genii can be found, for example, at the church of St. Giles, Tockenham, Wiltshire where the genius locus is depicted as a relief in the wall of a Norman church built of Roman material. This shows \\"a youthful and curly-haired Roman Genius worked in high relief, holding a cornucopia in his left hand and a patera in his right\\", which previously has been \\"erroneously identified as Asclepius\\".Toynbee, J. M. C. (1978). \\"Two Romano-British Genii\\", in Britannia, Vol. 9, p. 330. London: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies. Asian usage The numinous spirits of places in Asia are still honored today in city pillar shrines, outdoor spirit houses and indoor household and business shrines. Western usage In contemporary usage, genius loci usually refers to a location's distinctive atmosphere, or a \\"spirit of the place\\", rather than necessarily a guardian spirit. An example of contemporary usage might be along the lines of \\"Light reveals the genius loci of a place.\\" Art and architecture Alexander Pope made the genius loci an important principle in garden and landscape design with the following lines from Epistle IV, to Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington: > Consult the genius of the place in all; That tells the waters to rise, or > fall; Or helps th' ambitious hill the heav'ns to scale, Or scoops in > circling theatres the vale; Calls in the country, catches opening glades, > Joins willing woods, and varies shades from shades, Now breaks, or now > directs, th' intending lines; Paints as you plant, and, as you work, > designs. Pope's verse laid the foundation for one of the most widely agreed principles of landscape architecture. This is the principle that landscape designs should always be adapted to the context in which they are located. A priori, archetype, and genius loci are the primary principals of Neo-Rationalism or New Rationalism. Pioneered by the Italian architect Aldo Rossi, Neo- Rationalism developed in the light of a re-evaluation of the work of Giuseppe Terragni, and gained momentum through the work of Giorgio Grassi. Characterized by elemental vernacular forms and an adaptation to the existing environment, the Neo-Rationalist style has adherents beyond architecture in the greater world of art. In the context of modern architectural theory, genius loci has profound implications for place-making, falling within the philosophical branch of \\"phenomenology\\". This field of architectural discourse is explored most notably by the theorist Christian Norberg-Schulz in his book, Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture. Modern fantasy Adaptations of the original concept of the genius loci appear in some works of modern fantasy. Tom Bombadil in The Lord of the Rings has been described by Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey as the genius loci of the Old Forest, a wooded land bordering the Shire.Tom Shippey, The Road to Middle-earth, p 108, In the Dungeons and Dragons 3.0 edition book the Epic Level Handbook, the genius loci is a malign, powerful ooze that mimics the landscape and has no intelligence of its own. It can magically enslave a visitor, whose mind affects the genius loci's behaviour. It is spontaneously generated when a place is undisturbed for a long time. In The Dresden Files, a genius loci is an elemental spirit of a place. The island of Demonreach has its own genius loci, also named Demonreach, which is omniscient with regards to its own island. Wizards can form a spiritual connection with a genius loci and the place it represents.

Oil spills in particular have been of interest to geochemists in regards to the impact of petroleum and oil on the current geological environment. Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, organic geochemistry knowledge on oil-spill chemistry bloomed with the analyses of samples from the spill.A.E. Bence, K.A. Kvenvolden, M.C. Kennicutt, Organic geochemistry applied to environmental assessments of Prince William Sound, Alaska, after the Exxon Valdez oil spill‚Äîa review, Organic Geochemistry, Volume 24, Issue 1,1996, 7-42, https://doi.org/10.1016/0146-6380(96)00010-1. Geochemists study petroleum-inclusions in geological samples to compare present-day fluid-inclusions to dated samples. This analysis provides insight into the age of the petroleum samples and the surrounding rock. Spectrographic, optical, destructive, and nondestructive methods are used to analyze samples via mass spectrometry or Raman spectroscopy. The discovered differences in samples, such as oil-to-gas ratio or viscosity are typically attributed to the rock source of the sample. Other characteristics typically noted are pressure/volume/temperature properties, sample texture, and sample composition. Complications in analysis arise when the source rock is near or in a water source.Herbert Volk, Simon C.

Carbon cycle diagram Carbon-13 Placement in Isotope Chart where N is number of neutrons and Z is atomic number Petroleum is also studied via carbon isotope analysis. Carbon isotopes provide insight into the Earth's carbon cycle and geological processes. Geochemists are able to discern the composition of petroleum deposits by examining the ratio of carbon isotopes and comparing this ratio to known values for carbon based structures of which the petroleum could be composed.Stahl W.J.

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg =Coal= Vast knowledge about coal has been attained since the inception of its use as an energy source. However, modern geochemists are still studying how plant material changes into coal. They have determined coalification results from a selective degradation of plant materials, while other plant material is preserved. Coal macromolecules are usually made up of these degradation-resistant biopolymers contained in algae, spores, and wood. Geochemists have unraveled the mysteries behind coal formation by comparing properties of the biopolymers to properties found in existing coal macromolecules. The analytical methods of Carbon NMR and gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with flash pyrolysis has greatly enhanced the ability of organic geochemists to analyse the minute structural units of coal.Patrick G Hatcher, David J Clifford,The organic geochemistry of coal: from plant materials to coal, Organic Geochemistry, Volume 27, Issues 5‚Äì6, 1997,251-274,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0146-6380(97)00051-X. Example of isochron dating diagram and analysis Further knowledge into the age of coal sediments has been attained via isochron dating of uranium in the coalified samples.

Environmental Modern organic geochemistry includes studies of recent sediments to understand the carbon cycle, climate change, and ocean processes. In connection with petroleum studies, petroleum-focused geochemists also examine the impact of petroleum on the geological environment.A.E. Bence, K.A. Kvenvolden, M.C.

Geochemistry also examines other pollutants in geological systems, such as metabolites formed from the degradation of hydrocarbons. Organic geochemistry analytical techniques, such as GC-MS, allow chemists to determine the intricate effects of organic metabolites and human-derived waste products on the geological environment.Hans H. Richnow, Richard Seifert, Jens Hefter, Matthias K√§stner, Bernd Mahro, Walter Michaelis, Metabolites of xenobiotica and mineral oil constituents linked to macromolecular organic matter in polluted environments, Organic Geochemistry, Volume 22, Issues 3‚Äì5,1994, 671-IN10, https://doi.org/10.1016/0146-6380(94)90132-5. Of specific concern are the human-derived pollutants stemming from agricultural work. The use of animal manure, in combination with general municipal and sewage waste management, has changed many physical properties of the agricultural soil involved and the surrounding soils.Khaleel, R., K. R. Reddy, and M. R. Overcash. 1981. Changes in Soil Physical Properties Due to Organic Waste Applications: A Review1. J. Environ.

Pollutants, their metabolites, and how both enter bodies of water are of particular importance in the field. This organic matter can also be derived from geological processes in or near bodies of water, similarly influencing nearby lifeforms and protein production. Fluorescence spectroscopy has been introduced as a technique to examine organic matter in bodies of water, as dissolved organic matter is typically fluorescent.Hudson, N. , Baker, A. and Reynolds, D.

European navies of several nations used forced recruitment by various means. The large size of the British Royal Navy in the Age of Sail meant impressment was most commonly associated with Great Britain and Ireland. It was used by the Royal Navy in wartime, beginning in 1664 and during the 18th and early 19th centuries as a means of crewing warships, although legal sanction for the practice can be traced back to the time of Edward I of England. The Royal Navy impressed many merchant sailors, as well as some sailors from other, mostly European, nations. People liable to impressment were \\"eligible men of seafaring habits between the ages of 18 and 55 years\\". Non-seamen were sometimes impressed as well, though rarely. Impressment was strongly criticized by those who believed it to be contrary to the British constitution; unlike many of its continental rivals at the time, British subjects were not subject to conscription for military service, with the exception of a brief experiment with army impressment from 1778 to 1780. Though the public opposed conscription in general, impressment was repeatedly upheld by the courts, as it was deemed vital to the strength of the navy and, by extension, to the survival of the British influence and realm. Impressment was essentially a Royal Navy practice, reflecting the sheer size of the British fleet and its substantial manpower demands. While other European navies applied forced recruitment in times of war, this was generally done as an extension of the practice of formal conscription applied by most European armies from the Napoleonic Wars on. The U.S. Continental Navy also applied a form of impressment during the American War of Independence. The impressment of seamen from American ships caused serious tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies in the years leading up to the Revolutionary War. One of the 27 colonial grievances directly highlights the practice. It was again a cause of tension leading up to the War of 1812. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Britain formally ended the practice; later conscription was not limited to the Royal Navy but covered all British armed forces. Royal Navy recruiting and desertion Working and living conditions for the average sailor in the Royal Navy in the 18th century were very harsh by modern standards. Naval pay was attractive in the 1750s, but towards the end of the century its value had been steadily eroded by rising prices.Roger (1986) p. 137 Sailors' pay on merchant ships was somewhat higher during peacetime, and could increase to double naval pay during wartime. Until 19th-century reforms improved conditions, the Royal Navy was additionally known to pay wages up to two years in arrears, and it always withheld six months' pay as standard in order to discourage desertion. Naval wages had been set in 1653, and were not increased until April 1797 after sailors on 80 ships of the Channel Fleet based at Spithead mutinied.Rodger (1986), pp 63‚Äì64, 115‚Äì118, 127‚Äì128 Despite this, there were still many volunteers for naval service. The work for individual sailors was less than on merchant ships, since the naval crew size was determined by the number needed to man guns - around four times the number of crew than was needed to simply sail the ship. Furthermore, the food supplied by the Navy was plentiful, regular, and of good quality by the standards of the day.Rodger (1986), p.116 In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was not at all unusual for impressed men to view life in the navy (hard though it was) as still preferable to their previous lives on shore, and to volunteer for further service when the opportunity came to leave the ship. Shipowners and governments routinely estimated that 50% of the sailors on a given voyage would die due to scurvy. The main problem with naval recruitment, though, was a shortage of qualified and experienced seamen during wartime, when the Navy quickly had to recruit an extra 20,000 (early 18th century) to 40,000 men (late 18th century). Privateers, the Royal Navy, and the Merchant Navy all competed for a small pool of ordinary and able seamen in wartime, and all three groups were usually short-handed. The recruitment figures presented to Parliament for the years 1755‚Äì1757 list 70,566 men, of whom 33,243 were volunteers (47%), 16,953 pressed men (24%), while another 20,370 were also listed as volunteers separately (29%). Although there are no records that explain why volunteers were separated into two groups, it is likely these were pressed men who became \\"volunteers\\" to get the sign-up bonus, two months' wages in advance and a higher wage; it is known large numbers did do this. Volunteering also protected the sailor from creditors, as the law forbade collecting debts accrued before enlistment. The main disadvantage was that volunteers who subsequently deserted were liable to execution if captured; whereas pressed men would simply be returned to service. Other records confirm similar percentages throughout the 18th century. Average annual recruitment 1736‚Äì1783Fischer, Lewis R.; Nordvik, Helge W.

In the 18th century, British desertion rates on naval ships averaged 25% annually, with slight difference between volunteers and pressed men.IRSH 54 (2009), Niklas Frykman: Seamen on Late Eighteenth-Century European Warships. pp. 67‚Äì93 doi:10.1017/S0020859009000030 For example, the frigate HMS Hermione, with a regular complement of 180 men had 129 desertions between 1793 and 1797. Desertion rates for Dutch and French warships was even higher with annual rates of up to 90% not uncommon. In 1795, the Dutch vesselStaaten Generaal, with a complement of 550 lost 428 to desertion, the Delft, with 350 men lost 340. The rate of desertion started high, then fell heavily after a few months on board a ship, and generally became negligible after a year -- because Navy pay ran months or years in arrears, desertion might mean not only abandoning companions in the ship's company, but also the loss of a large amount of money already earned. If a naval ship had taken a prize, a deserting seaman would also forfeit his share of the prize money. In a report on proposed changes to the RN written by Admiral Nelson in 1803, he noted that since 1793 more than 42,000 sailors had deserted. The Impress Service and impressment at sea The Press-gang, oil painting by Luke Clennell The Impress Service (colloquially called the \\"press- gang\\") was formed to force sailors to serve on naval vessels. There was no concept of \\"joining the navy\\" as a fixed career-path for non-officers at the time, since seamen remained attached to a ship only for the duration of its commission. They were encouraged to stay in the Navy after the commission but could leave to seek other employment when the ship was paid off. Impressment relied on the legal power of the King to call men to military service, as well as to recruit volunteers (who were paid a bounty upon joining, unlike pressed men). Seamen were not covered by Magna Carta and \\"failure to allow oneself to be pressed\\" was punishable by hanging, although the punishment became less severe over time.Conditions of service in Britain's maritime organisations pp. 39‚Äì40. In Elizabethan times a statute regulated impressment as a form of recruitment, and with the introduction of the Vagabonds Act in 1597 men of disrepute (vagrants) found themselves drafted into service. In 1703 an act passed limiting the impressment of men under 18 years of age to those who were not apprenticed. A further act in 1740 raised the maximum age to 55. Although no foreigner could normally be pressed, they lost their protection if they married a British woman or had worked on a British merchant ship for two years. Some governments, including Britain, issued \\"protections\\" against impressment which protected men had to carry on their person at all times; but in times of crisis the Admiralty would order a \\"hot press\\", which meant that no-one remained exempt. The Royal Navy also impressed seamen from inbound British merchant ships at sea, though this was done by individual warships, rather than by the Impress Service. Impressment, particularly press gangs, became consistently unpopular with the British public (as well as in the American colonies), and local officials often acted against them, to the point of imprisoning officers from the Impress Service or opposing them by force of arms. Basis At the time of the Battle of Trafalgar over half the Royal Navy's 120,000 sailors were pressed men. The power of the Impressment Service to conscript was limited by law to seafarers, including merchant seamen, longshoremen and fishermen. There is no basis to the widespread impression that civilians without any seafaring background were randomly seized from home, country lane or workplace by press gangs or that the latter were employed inland away from coastal ports.John Keegan, Battle at Sea, p. 38. However, convicted petty criminals were often given the option of volunteering for naval service as unskilled \\"quota men\\" by inland courts (see below).John Keegan, Battle at Sea, p. 39. This tablet commemorates the Admiralty's apology for the murder of two quarrymen (Alexander Andrews and Rick Flann) and one blacksmith (William Lano), during an illegal attempt to impress them on the Isle of Portland in Dorset on 2 April 1803. A young lady, Mary Way was also murdered according to a Coroner's inquest. The illegality of the raid was confirmed in the London and local courts. Grave of Mary Way, shot by press- gangers during anti-impressment demonstrations. There were occasions when the local populace would band together to oppose the activities of the press. One such incident, the Easton Massacre in 1803, resulted in a press gang firing on a crowd, killing four people in the village of Easton on the Isle of Portland, where they were trying to impress the quarrymen. In 1808, Thomas Urquhart was saved from a press gang of three or four men when London passersby intervened. Urquhart complained to local officials, identified at least one of the men involved and successfully sued for damages in the Court of King's Bench. He went on to lobby for changes in law and practice, publishing Letters on the evils of impressment: with the outline of a plan for doing them away, on which depend the wealth, prosperity, and consequence of Great Britain in 1816. Patrolling in or near sea ports, the press gang would try to find men aged between 15 and 55 with seafaring or river-boat experience, but this was not essential; those with no experience were called \\"landsmen\\". From 1740, landsmen were legally exempt from impressment, but this was on occasion ignored in wartime unless the person seized was an apprentice or a \\"gentleman\\".BBC History Magazine, Vol.9 no. 8, August 2008. Two landsmen were considered by captains to be the equivalent of one able seaman. If a landsman was able to prove his status to the Admiralty he was usually released. Court records do however show fights breaking out as people attempted to avoid what was perceived as wrongful impressment, and the London Times reported occasions when press gangs instituted a \\"hot press\\" (ignoring protections against impressment) in order to man the navy.The Times (London), 8 May 1805 The Neglected Tar, c. 1800, evokes the effects of impressment on a seaman's family and home. Merchant seamen ashore from their ships (and usually conspicuous by their clothing and general appearance) were however another matter. Anyone with seafaring experience encountered in the street would first be asked to volunteer for naval service. If the potential recruit refused he was often plied with alcohol or simply seized and taken. A commonly held belief is that a trick was used in taverns, surreptitiously dropping a King's shilling (\\"prest money\\") into a man's drink, as by \\"finding\\" the shilling in his possession he was deemed to have volunteered, and that this led to some tavern owners putting glass bottoms in their tankards. However, this is a legend; press officers were subject to fines for using trickery and a volunteer had a \\"cooling-off\\" period in which to change his mind. The great majority of men pressed were taken from merchant ships at sea, especially those homeward bound for Britain. This was legal as long as the Navy replaced the man they took, and many Naval captains would take the best seamen, replacing them with malcontents and landsmen from their own ship. It was also common for \\"trusted\\" volunteers to act as substitutes; they would then desert as soon as the merchant ship docked, and return to their Navy ship. Outbound merchant ships, officers and apprentices were exempt from impressment. When war broke out the Navy would deploy frigates and vessels off the coast to intercept inbound merchantmen. Reportedly some merchant captains redirected their ships to Irish ports to offload favoured crewmen, before making final landfall in England. In 1740, a merchantman fired on a cruiser attempting to impress its crew; threats of similar violence to avoid sailors being pressed were supposedly not uncommon, especially with the East India ships whose crews had been away from their families and England for a considerable time. In times of an extreme shortage of men, the Navy would \\"embargo\\" the coast for a short time; merchantmen had to supply a portion of their crew in exchange for permission to sail. Many merchant ships had hiding places constructed where their best crew could hide when approached by a Naval vessel. In addition to impressment, Britain also used the Quota System (or The Quod) from 1795 to 1815, whereby each county was required to supply a certain number of volunteers, based on its population and the number of its seaports. Unlike impressment, the Quota System often resulted in criminals serving on board ships as counties who failed to meet their quota offered prisoners the option of completing their sentence or volunteering. Apart from the probably lower quality of recruits taken by this means, another downside of the Quota System was the frequent introduction of disease, especially typhus, to healthy ships. In Ireland Ireland formed a separate but subordinate state, the Kingdom of Ireland, between 1534 and 1800. All of Ireland was united to Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland between 1801 and 1922. The Royal Navy recruited heavily in Ireland during this period, including using impressment. For example, in 1734, impressment took place in Wicklow. Impressment was also common during the Napoleonic wars, although poverty in Ireland made sure that volunteers were usually available. British North America One of the largest impressment operations occurred in the spring of 1757 in New York City, then still under British colonial rule. Three thousand British soldiers cordoned off the city, and plucked clean the taverns and other sailors' gathering places. \\"All kinds of tradesmen and Negroes\\" were hauled in, nearly eight hundred in all.Nash, p. 151. Four hundred of these were \\"retained in the service\\". The Royal Navy also used impressment extensively in British North America from 1775 to 1815. Its press gangs sparked resistance, riots, and political turmoil in seaports such as Halifax, St John's, and Quebec City. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy extended the reach of its press gangs into coastal areas of British North America by the early 19th century. In response, sailors and residents fought back with a range of tactics. They sometimes reacted violently. The riots in St John's in 1794 and Halifax in 1805 led to a prohibition on impressment on shore for much of the Napoleonic Wars. The protest came from a wide swath of the urban community, including elites, rather than just the vulnerable sailors, and had a lasting negative impact on civil‚Äìnaval relations in what became Canada. The local communities did not encourage their young men to volunteer for the Royal Navy.Keith Mercer, \\"Northern Exposure: Resistance to Naval Impressment in British North America, 1775‚Äì1815\\", Canadian Historical Review, June 2010, Vol. 91 Issue 2, pp. 199‚Äì232. Continental Navy The American Continental Navy impressed men into its service during the American Revolutionary War. The Continental Congress authorized construction of thirteen frigates, including in 1775. The senior captain of the Continental Navy, James Nicholson, was appointed to command Virginia. When it was fitted out in 1777, Nicholson received orders to sail to Martinique. Many of Nicholson's crew had deserted to sign on as privateers, for higher pay at less risk. Therefore, Nicholson impressed about thirty citizens of Baltimore, an act expressly forbidden by Maryland law. Maryland governor Thomas Johnson demanded immediate release of the impressed men and Congress convinced Nicholson to release them all. Nicholson avoided impressment on land and instead stopped two American merchant ships at sea in 1780, to impress men from their crews.Elizabeth Cometti, \\"Impressment during the American Revolution.\\" The Walter Clinton Jackson Essays in the Social Sciences (University of North Carolina Press, 1942), 97-109. The individual states did not deny the concept of impressment for their own navies, but were reluctant to grant the right to the Continental Congress. The concept of drafting men into armed service remained contentious, even after adoption of the federal constitution.Fowler, William M., Jr. \\"The Non-Volunteer Navy\\". United States Naval Institute Proceedings August 1974 pp. 75‚Äì78. There is one documented case of a British seaman impressed by the US Navy in 1810.John P. Deeben, \\"The War of 1812 Stoking the Fires: The Impressment of Seaman Charles Davis by the U.S. Navy\\", Prologue Magazine, U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, Summer 2012, Vol. 44, No. 2 Conflict with the United States In 1795, the Jay Treaty went into effect, addressing many issues left unresolved after the American Revolution, and averting a renewed conflict. However, the treaty's neglect to address British impressment of sailors from American ships and ports became a major cause of complaint among those who disapproved of it. While non-British subjects were not impressed, Britain did not recognize naturalised American citizenship, and treated anyone born a British subject as still \\"British\\"; as a result, the Royal Navy impressed over 9,000 sailors who claimed to be American citizens. During the wars with France (1793 to 1815), the Royal Navy aggressively reclaimed British deserters on board ships of other nations, both by halting and searching merchant ships, and, in many cases, by searching American port cities. Although this was illegal, Jefferson ignored it to remain on good terms with Britain as he was negotiating to obtain \\"the Floridas\\". This changed in 1805 when the British began seizing American merchantmen trading with the West Indies and condemning the ships and their cargoes as a prize and enforcing impressment on their crews.Anthony Steel, \\"Anthony Merry and the Anglo-American Dispute about Impressment, 1803-6.\\" Cambridge Historical Journal 9#3 (1949): 331-51 online. Under the Rule of 1756, in times of war, direct trade between a neutral European state and a British colony was forbidden if such trade had not existed in time of peace. The Americans had found a way around this by \\"landing\\" cargoes from Europe in the United States and issuing certificates that duty had been paid. The ship would then sail, with the cargo never having been offloaded or duty actually paid, as now bona fide commerce between neutral America and the West Indies. The British became aware of the practice during the court case involving the seizure of the Essex. The court ruled that the cargo of the Essex had never been intended for American markets so the voyage had not been broken and could thus be considered continuous. The end result was the blockade of New York Harbor by two British frigates, the Cambrian and the Leander, which provoked public demonstrations. For the next year scores of American ships were condemned in admiralty courts and American seamen were impressed with increasing frequency until, in the early summer of 1807, when three deserters from the British frigate lying in Chesapeake Bay enlisted on the American frigate . After searching the Chesapeake, the deserters, David Martin, John Strachan, and William Ware, were found to be native-born Americans who had been wrongly impressed. The search also established that another crew member listed as Jenkin Ratford, was actually a British deserter, but he could not be found. Admiral Berkeley angrily issued an order to all commanders in the North Atlantic Squadron to search the Chesapeake if encountered on the high seas. Eight miles southeast of Cape Henry a boat from the British frigate intercepted her but Commodore Barron declined to permit his crew to be mustered. The Leopard began approaching and the commander shouted a warning to which Barron replied \\"I don't hear what you say\\". The Leopard then fired two shots across the bow and almost immediately poured a broadside into the American ship. The Chesapeake did not return fire but the British ship fired another two broadsides. Three crew were killed and eighteen wounded. The British boarding party not only arrested the British deserter but also the three Americans. The Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard Affair provoked an outcry for war from all parts of the country and Jefferson later wrote: \\"The affair of the Chesapeake put war into my hand, I had only to open it and let havoc loose\\". He ordered the state governors to ready their militias but the Embargo Act of 1807 he eventually passed only ordered all British armed vessels out of American waters and forbade all contact with them if they remained. As a cause of the War of 1812, the impressment and ship seizures caused serious diplomatic tension, and helped to turn American public opinion against Britain. Impressment was widely perceived as humiliating and dishonoring the U.S. because it was unable to protect its ships and sailors.Paul A. Gilje, Free Trade and Sailors' Rights': The Rhetoric of the War of 1812\\", Journal of the Early Republic, Spring 2010, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp. 1‚Äì23.Spencer Tucker, Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair (2006). End of impressment Britain fought the war against Napoleon on the high seas, enlarging its Royal Navy from 135 ships in 1793 to 584 in 1812, and expanding personnel from 36,000 seamen in 1793 to 114,000 in 1812.James Fulton Zimmerman, Impressment of American Seamen (1925). In spring 1814 Napoleon surrendered, the allies restored the Bourbon kings to the throne, and France was no longer an enemy of Great Britain. The naval war was over and Britain could now sharply reduce its Royal Navy. It had no need to impress sailors, and never again used that means of forced recruitment, although it did not officially renounce the practice.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th Edition, vol. 14, p. 347Michael Lewis, A Social History of the Navy 1793‚Äì1815 (1960), p. 434 By the time of Britain's next major war, against Russia in 1853, a new system of fixed-term engagements had given the Royal Navy a sufficient number of volunteer recruits to meet its manpower needs. Throughout the remainder of the 19th century changes in manpower needs and improved conditions of service permitted the Royal Navy to rely on voluntary enlistment to meet its requirements, augmented by the recall of reservists when necessary. This continued to be the case until World War I, when organised conscription was introduced in 1916 for all the military services. English and later British naval impressment laws The first Act of Parliament legalising this practice was passed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth in 1563 and was known as \\"An Act touching political considerations for the maintenance of the navy\\". It was renewed many times until 1631. In the Vagabonds Act 1597, several lists of persons were subject to impressment for service in the fleet. Following the execution of King Charles I, the Rump Parliament passed several acts in 1649 and 1650 concerning the encouragement of officers, mariners and for the impressment of seamen (e.g. 22 February 1648/9). In 1695 an Act was passed to build a permanent register of 30000 men for ready call-up by the navy, \\"without having recourse to the barbarous and unconstitutional practice of pressing\\".Adam Anderson (1787). An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce..., pp. 624‚Äì625. The act also established basic rules and benefits for all types of seamen, including access to Greenwich Hospital. With wars raging in Europe and in America the Navigation Act 1703 (2 & 3 Ann. c. 6) was passed \\"for the of Seamen and better Encouragement of Navigation, and the Protection of the Coal Trade\\".2 & 3 Ann. c. 6, in The Statutes of the Realm, Vol. 8 (1821), p. 258 This act gave parish authorities the power to indenture and apprentice boys to the sea, from as young as 10, until age 21; it also reaffirmed that rogues and vagabonds were subject to be pressed into the navy. The act establishes administration and regulations for the act, including youth who volunteer for the indenture and certain seamen engaged in the coal trade supplying cities, are exempt from impressment for three years. This act was followed by the Recruiting Act 1703 (2 & 3 Ann. c. 13), which allows impressing able-bodied men into the army and navy who did not have visible means of subsistence; also as a wartime measure the act relaxes English crewing requirements under the Navigation Acts, to make experienced English seamen more available to serve on ships of war.2 & 3 Ann. c. 13, in The Statutes of the Realm, Vol. 8 (1821), p. 275 In 1740, impressment was limited to men between 18 and 45, and it also exempted foreigners. As part of a wider effort to build colonial capability and harass its enemies, Parliament passed the Trade to America Act 1707 (6 Ann. c. 64). Section 9 mandated that mariners serving on board privateers and trading ships in any part of America, and those on shore, are not liable for impressment.6 Ann. c. 64, in The Statutes of the Realm, Vol. 8 (1821), p. 806 Lingering questions remained whether the law applied only to the navy, or to civil authorities as well, and whether it applied only to the current war or to all future wars.Rodger (2004), p. 316. Two attorneys-general of Great Britain, one in 1716, and another in 1740, issued opinions that the 1707 Act was no longer in effect,Smith, p. 291. but many American colonists disagreed. Despite doubts over the continuing legality of impressment in continental waters, but for similar reasons, Parliament passed the Sugar Trade Act 1746 (19 Geo. 2 c. 30) stating that impressment was forbidden in the West Indies, but it added certain exceptions and made no specific mention of America.19 Geo. 2 c. 30, in Danny Pickering (ed.), The Statutes at Large, from the 15th to the 20th Year of King George II (1765), Gray's Inn, p. 472 This would lead to the Knowles Riot in Boston the following year, and continuing colonial questions, particularly in heavily maritime New England. The last law was passed in 1835, in which the power to impress was reaffirmed. This limited the length of service of a pressed man to five years, and added the provision that a man could not be pressed twice. Although Britain abandoned the practice of impressment in 1815, impressment remained legal until the early 1900s, and the various laws authorising impressment have never been repealed. British army impressment laws Starting in 1645, the New Model Army raised by Oliver Cromwell to overthrow Charles I during the English Civil War was largely manned by impressment. After the restoration of the monarchy, impressment into the army was discontinued. During the American Revolutionary War, after the losses at the Battle of Saratoga and the impending hostilities with France, the existing voluntary enlistment measures were judged to be insufficient. Between 1775 and 1781, the regular army increased from 48,000 to 110,000. Two acts were passed, the Recruiting Act 1778 and the Recruiting Act 1779, for the impression of individuals into the British Army.Curtis, p. 57‚Äì60. The chief advantages of these acts was in the number of volunteers brought in under the apprehension of impressment. To avoid impressment, some recruits incapacitated themselves by cutting off the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, making it impossible to use a musket or sword.Curtis, p. 64. The Recruiting Act of 1779 was repealed on 26 May 1780, and army impressment was permanently discontinued. During the experiment, the British government allowed army impressment under severely restricted circumstances -- both acts emphasized volunteering over impressment, and offered strong incentives to volunteers as a \\"carrot and stick\\" tactic, to encourage the men to volunteer lest they be pressed instead. The impressment portion of the 1778 Act applied only to Scotland and the area around London, excluding Wales and the rest of England, to avoid interfering with harvesting. The 1779 Act applied to all of Great Britain, but was initially suspended everywhere except the area around London, and actually applied to all of Great Britain for only six months, until the 1779 act was repealed in May 1780, and army impressment ceased in Britain. Unlike naval impressment, army impressment applied only to \\"able-bodied idle, and disorderly Persons, who could not, upon Examination, prove themselves to exercise and industriously follow some lawful Trade or Employment, or to have some Substance sufficient for their Support and Maintenance\\", as well as smugglers, according to the 1778 law, but excluding from that any men who were voters, or harvest workers. The 1779 law extended impressment also to \\"incorrigible rogues\\" who had abandoned their families, and left them as expenses on the parish.Curtis, chapter 3. Impressed apprentices were released under appeal from their masters, and impressed foreigners were released when requested by their countries' embassies. In popular culture Illustration from Poor Jack (1840) of a boy being pressed Literature *Poor Jack (1840) by Frederick Marryat, features a scene in which a press-gang board a merchantman and collar a young sailor below decks. When brought on deck he finds he has been impressed by his own brother. *The events in Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Sylvia's Lovers (1863) take place against the background of the practice of impressment during the early phases of the Napoleonic Wars. Charlie Kinraid is forcibly enlisted in the Royal Navy by a press gang and later Sylvia Robson's father is executed for leading a revengeful raid on press-gang collaborators. *In Herman Melville's novel Billy Budd, Sailor, first published in 1924, and in the opera and film based on it, Billy is impressed to service on a British warship from Right-of-Man, a merchant ship. * In Hornblower and the Atropos by C. S. Forester, Captain Horatio Hornblower is depicted, when urgently needing sailors to make up his crew, as stopping a ship of the British East India Company and impressing a large part of its sailors ‚Äì the sailors being very reluctant, since conditions in the Royal navy ships were far worse than in those of the civilian Company. *In China Mi√©ville's 2002 novel The Scar, many members of The Armada society are pressganged from various ships to live on the floating colony. Mi√©ville favours the word \\"pressganged\\" and has used it in numerous works of fiction to refer to people compelled to join some organisation or faction against their wills for political purposes. Poetry * Elizabeth Barrett Browning's first published poem, \\"On the Cruelty of Forcement to Man\\" (c. 1812, when she was six years old), addressed impressment. * John Ashton's 1888 compilation Modern Street Ballads includes \\"Victory\\", relating the plight of a young aristocratic lady whose parents, disapproving of her poor suitor, arrange to have him pressed to service aboard Lord Nelson's flagship of that name, aboard which he is killed at the Battle of Trafalgar. Music * Garage punk band The Murder City Devils' song \\"Press Gang\\", from their album In Name and Blood, is about a man who becomes \\"a victim of the press gang\\", a group of soldiers which brings him from a ship at sea to a town and publicly hangs him for unnamed offenses. * Folk singer Richard Digance wrote \\"I Hear The Pressgang\\", describing the tale of a man forcibly enlisted into the Royal Navy who later drowned at sea. The song asks who will look after his wife, child and farm whilst he is gone. Cinema * H.M.S.

Name  There exist several interpretations as to the origin and meaning of the Irish placename Gallarus. Archaeologist Peter Harbison ventures the meaning to be something like \\"the house or shelter for foreigner(s)\\" (Gall Aras), the said foreigners being possibly \\"these pilgrims that have come from outside the Peninsula.\\" However, according to lexicologist P√°draig √ì Siochfhradha (aka An Seabhach), the name does not refer to a foreign settlement but to a rocky headland (Gall- iorrus).T. J. Barrington, Discovering Kerry: Its History, Heritage and Topography, Collins Press, 1999, 336 p. (originally published in 1976), p. 247: \\"The name does not, according to An Seabhach, refer to a foreign settlement but to a rocky headland}.\\"  Discovery  As the oratory is the only intact specimen of its type, it has attracted considerable attention, starting from antiquarians in the middle of the 18th century. The first account we have of the oratory is Charles Smith's description of 1756 in The Antient and Present State of the County of Kerry (Dublin), p. 191).Peter Harbison, How Old is Gallarus Oratory? A Reappraisal of Its Role in Early Irish Architecture, in Medieval Archeology, N. 14, 1970, p. 34-37, especially p. 34.  Architecture = Material  The oratory is built of large cut stones from the Dingle Beds of the Upper Silurian Old Red Sandstone. Charles Smith, who discovered the edifice in 1756, described the stone as \\"a brown free-stone, brought from the cliffs of the sea shore, which cuts readily and is very durable.\\"Charles Smith, The Antient and Present State of the County of Kerry, Dublin, 1756, p. 191.  Masonry  The stones are cut on every side and end so as to fit perfectly together. They exhibit smoothly finished outside facings that follow the slant of the wall. The edifice is usually thought to have been built without mortar, but there is evidence that even if mortar \\"was never visible in the wall facings it was used as a structural medium for the interior of the wall at least.\\"H. G. Leask, Irish Churches and Monastic Buildings, vol. I, Dundalk, 1955, p. 22: ‚ÄúThough Gallarus is built without mortar as a structural medium, mortar is not entirely absent from the building; very fine lime mortar has been found filling the internal joints here and there: an internal pointing to the stonework. It has also been observed filling small hollows in the inner faces of the vault, faces which were brought to a fair smooth finish with pick or punch by the builders. A thin layer of lime mortar is used to bond the stones together and to fill in small hollows in the inner faces.Peter Harbison, How old is Gallarus oratory?, op. cit., p. 34.  Morphology  The oratory‚Äôs shape has been compared to that of an upturned boat because of its sloping side walls. The edifice uses corbel vaulting. The stones are positioned on each course with their edges projecting inward by a small increment as the walls rise. Besides, they are laid at a slight angle, lower on the outside than on the inside, thus allowing rainwater to run off. Both techniques can still be seen in the modern agricultural cloch√°ns of the Dingle peninsula. The edifice has two side walls and two end walls, sloping and converging at the top, each of one piece, playing a dual role as load-bearing wall and corbelled half-vault. Some slight sagging has occurred across the length of the northern roof slope.  Interior  The interior room is approximately by , a size that befits more an oratory or a small chapel than a church. It is dimly lit, with only a tiny round-headed window in the east wall, opposite the entrance door. The window splays more widely towards the inside of the wall. The doorway is 1.67 m (5.5 ft) high. It has a flat lintel. On the inside over the lintel, two holed stones project out from the wall, possibly for the attachment of a wooden door.  Dates and uses  Minor trial cuttings carried out at Gallarus in November 1970 yielded no finds or evidence of features or activity which might shed light on the period of construction and use of the oratory.Peter Harbison, How old is Gallarus oratory?, op. cit., pp. 57‚Äì58: \\"Finally it should be mentioned that minor trial cuttings carried out by T. Fanning at Gallarus in November 1970, on behalf of the National Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works, preparatory to drainage works on the site, yielded no finds or evidence of features or activity which might shed light on the period of construction and use of the oratory\\".  An early Irish stone church  Antiquarian Charles SmithCharles Smith, The Antient and Present State of the County of Kerry, Dublin, 1756, p. 191. is the originator of the claim that the building is an early Irish stone church although no historical information is available prior to 1756 regarding its use.The Grove Encyclopaedia of Medieval Art and Architecture, vol. 2, Colum P. Hourihane (ed.), OUP USA, 2012, 677 p., pp. 635‚Äì636.  A Romanesque Church  In 1970, archaeologist Peter Harbison argued that the oratory might have been built as late as the 12th century for a number of reasons, mainly because the east window has a rounded top made of two carved stones (not a true arch).Peter Harbison, How old is Gallarus Oratory?, op. cit.  A private funerary chapel  Harbison also produced some evidence pointing to a later date and a different use: a letter by English traveller Richard Pococke who visited the oratory in 1758, two years after it was discovered by Charles Smith:also the \\"discoverer\\" of Skellig Michael monastic stone huts \\"Near this building they show a grave with a head at the cross of it and call it the tomb of the Giant; the tradition is that Griffith More was buried there, & as they call'd [it] a chapel, so probably it was built by him or his family at their burial place.\\"Peter Harbison, How old is Gallarus oratory?, op. cit., p. 36.  A shelter for pilgrims  In 1994 and 1995, Peter Harbison gave up the hypothesis of a 12th-century church and claimed that the placename Gallarus meant \\"the house or shelter of foreigner(s)\\" (Gall Aras), the said \\"foreigner(s)\\" being pilgrims from outside the peninsula.Peter Harbison, Pilgrimage in Ireland: The Monuments and the People, Syracuse University Press, 1995, 256 p., pp. 77‚Äì78. However, this does not accord with lexicologist Padraig O Siochfhradha's translation of the name as \\"rocky headland\\" (Gall-iorrus).T. J.

During World War II Colby served with the Office of Strategic Services. After the war he joined the newly created Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Before and during the Vietnam War, Colby served as chief of station in Saigon, chief of the CIA's Far East Division, and head of the Civil Operations and Rural Development effort, as well as overseeing the Phoenix Program. After Vietnam, Colby became director of central intelligence and during his tenure, under intense pressure from the United States Congress and the media, adopted a policy of relative openness about U.S. intelligence activities to the Senate Church Committee and House Pike Committee. Colby served as DCI under President Richard Nixon and President Gerald Ford until January 30, 1976 after which time he was succeeded by George H. W. Bush. Early life and family William Egan Colby was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1920. His father, Elbridge Colby, who came from a New England family with a history of military and public service, was a professor of English, an author, and a military officer who served in the Army and in university positions in Tientsin, China; Georgia; Vermont; and Washington, D.C. Though a career officer, Elbridge Colby's professional pursuits focused less on strictly military activities and more on intellectual and scholarly contributions to military and literary subjects. Elbridge's father, Charles Colby, had been a professor of chemistry at Columbia University but had died prematurely, leaving his family largely without money. William's mother, Margaret Egan, was from an Irish family in St. Paul active in business and Democratic politics. With his Army father, William Colby had a peripatetic upbringing before attending public high school in Burlington, Vermont. He then attended Princeton University and graduated with an A.B. in politics in 1940 after completing a 196-page long senior thesis titled \\"Surrender -- French Policy toward the Spanish Civil War.\\" He then studied at Columbia Law School the following year. Colby recounted that he took from his parents a desire to serve and a commitment to liberal politics, Catholicism, and independence, exemplified by his father's career-damaging protest in The Nation magazine regarding the lenient treatment of a white Georgian who had murdered a black U.S. soldier also based at Ft. Benning. Colby was for his entire life a staunch Roman Catholic. Archived on personal website. He was often referred to as \\"the warrior‚Äìpriest\\". The Catholic Church played a \\"central role\\" in his family's life, with Colby's two daughters receiving their First Communion at St. Peter's Basilica.Elliott, John (2011-11-11) Finding William Colby, The American Conservative He married Barbara Heinzen (1920‚Äì2015) in 1945 and they had five children. His daughter, Christine, was presented as a debutante to high society in 1978 at the International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. In 1984, he divorced Barbara and married Democratic diplomat Sally Shelton-Colby. Career=Office of Strategic Services Following his first year at Columbia, in 1941 Colby volunteered for active duty with the United States Army and served with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as a \\"Jedburgh\\", or special operator, trained to work with resistance forces in occupied Europe to harass German and Axis forces. During World War II, he parachuted behind enemy lines twice and earned the Silver Star as well as commendations from Norway, France, and Great Britain. In his first mission he deployed to France as a Jedburgh commanding Team BRUCE, in mid-August 1944, and operated with the Maquis until he joined up with Allied forces later that fall. In April 1945, he led the NORSO Group Operasjon Rype into Norway on a sabotage mission to destroy railway lines, in an effort to hinder German forces in Norway from reinforcing the final defense of Germany. After the war, Colby graduated from Columbia Law School and then briefly practiced law in William J. Donovan's New York firm. Bored by the practice of law and inspired by his liberal beliefs, he moved to Washington to work for the National Labor Relations Board.

Then an OSS friend offered him a job at the CIA, and Colby accepted. Colby spent the next 12 years in the field, first in Stockholm, Sweden. There, he helped set up the stay-behind networks of Operation Gladio, a covert paramilitary organization organized by the CIA to make any Soviet occupation more difficult, as he later described in his memoirs. Colby then spent much of the 1950s based in Rome, under cover as a State Department officer, where he led the Agency's covert political operations campaign to support anti-Communist parties in their electoral contests against left wing, Soviet Union‚Äìassociated parties. The Christian Democrats and allied parties won several key elections in the 1950s, preventing a takeover by the Communist Party. Colby was a vocal advocate within the CIA and the United States government for engaging the non-Communist left wing parties in order to create broader non-Communist coalitions capable of governing fractious Italy; this position first brought him into conflict with James J. Angleton. =Vietnam, SE Asia= In 1959 Colby became the CIA's deputy chief and then chief of station in Saigon, South Vietnam, where he served until 1962. Tasked by CIA with supporting the government of Ngo Dinh Diem, Colby established a relationship with President Diem's family and with Ngo Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, the president's brother, with whom Colby became close. While in Vietnam, Colby focused intensively on building up Vietnamese capabilities to combat the Viet Cong insurgency in the countryside. He argued that \\"the key to the war in Vietnam was the war in the villages.\\"\\"Interview with William Egan Colby, 1981.\\" 07/16/1981. WGBH Media Library & Archives. Retrieved 9 November 2010. In 1962 he returned to Washington to become the deputy and then chief of CIA's Far East Division, succeeding Desmond Fitzgerald, who had been tapped to lead the Agency's efforts against Castro's Cuba. During these years Colby was deeply involved in Washington's policies in East Asia, particularly with respect to Vietnam, as well as Indonesia, Japan, Korea, and China. He was deeply critical of the decision to abandon support for Diem, and he believed this played a material part in the weakening of the South Vietnamese position in the years following. In 1968, while Colby was preparing to take up the post of chief of the Soviet Bloc Division of the Agency, President Johnson instead sent Colby back to Vietnam as deputy to Robert Komer, who had been charged with streamlining the civilian side of the American and South Vietnamese efforts against the Communists. Shortly after arriving Colby succeeded Komer as head of the U.S./South Vietnamese rural pacification effort named CORDS. Part of the effort was the controversial Phoenix Program, an initiative designed to identify and attack the \\"Viet Cong Infrastructure.\\" There is considerable debate about the merits of the program, which was subject to allegations that it relied on or was complicit in assassination and torture. Colby, however, consistently insisted that such tactics were not authorized by or permitted in the program. More broadly, along with Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) commander General Creighton Abrams, Colby was part of a leadership group that worked to apply a new approach to the war designed to focus more on pacification (winning hearts and minds) and securing the countryside as opposed to the \\"search and destroy\\" approach that had characterized General William Westmoreland's tenure as MACV commander.For histories on the CIA's role in Vietnam and on the pacification effort more broadly, see foia.cia.gov Some, including Colby later in life, argue that this approach succeeded in reducing the Communist insurgency in South Vietnam, but that South Vietnam, without air and ground support by the United States after the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, was ultimately overwhelmed by a conventional North Vietnamese assault in 1975. The CORDS model and its approach influenced U.S. strategy and thinking on counterinsurgency in the 2000s in Iraq and Afghanistan. =CIA HQ: Director= Colby returned to Washington in 1971 and became executive director of CIA. After long-time DCI Richard Helms was dismissed by President Nixon in 1973, James Schlesinger assumed the helm at the Agency. A strong believer in reform of the CIA and the intelligence community more broadly, Schlesinger had written a 1971 Bureau of the Budget report outlining his views on the subject. Colby, who had had a somewhat unorthodox career in the CIA focused on political action and counterinsurgency, agreed with Schlesinger's reformist approach. Schlesinger appointed him head of the clandestine branch in early 1973. When Nixon reshuffled his agency heads and made Schlesinger secretary of defense, Colby emerged as a natural candidate for DCI‚Äîapparently on the basis of the recommendation that he was a professional who would not make waves. Colby was known as a media-friendly CIA director. His tenure as DCI, which lasted two and a half tumultuous years, was overshadowed by the Church and Pike congressional investigations into alleged U.S. intelligence malfeasance over the preceding 25 years, including 1975, the so-called Year of Intelligence. Colby's time as DCI was also eventful on the world stage. Shortly after he assumed leadership, the Yom Kippur War broke out, an event that surprised not only the American intelligence agencies but also the Israelis. This intelligence surprise reportedly affected Colby's credibility with the Nixon administration. Colby participated in the National Security Council meetings that responded to apparent Soviet intentions to intervene in the war by raising the alert level of U.S. forces to DEFCON 3 and defusing the crisis. In 1975, after many years of involvement, South Vietnam fell to Communist forces in April 1975, a particularly difficult blow for Colby, who had dedicated so much of his life and career to the American effort there. Events in the arms- control field, Angola, Australia,Pilger, John, A Secret Country, Vintage Books, London, 1992, , pp. 185, 210-11, 219, 235. the Middle East, and elsewhere also demanded attention. Colby also focused on internal reforms within the CIA and the intelligence community. He attempted to modernize what he believed to be some out-of-date structures and practices by disbanding the Board of National Estimates and replacing it with the National Intelligence Council.For further information on Colby's leadership of the Intelligence Community, see cia.gov In a speech from 1973 addressed to NSA employees he emphasised the role of free speech in USA and moral role of CIA as defender, not preventer of civil rights. An attempt to rebut the then emerging revelations of CIA and NSA domestic spying. He also mentioned a number of reforms intended to limit excessive classification of governmental information. President Ford, advised by Henry Kissinger and others concerned by Colby's controversial openness to Congress and distance from the White House, replaced Colby late in 1975 with George H. W. Bush during the so-called Halloween Massacre in which Secretary of Defense Schlesinger was also replaced (by Donald Rumsfeld). Colby was offered the position of United States Permanent Representative to NATO but turned it down. After the CIA In 1977 Colby founded a D.C. law firm‚ÄîColby, Miller & Hanes, with Marshall Miller, David Hanes, and associated lawyers, and worked on public policy issues. In consonance with his long-held liberal views, Colby became a supporter of the nuclear freeze and of reductions in military spending. He practiced law and advised various bodies on intelligence matters. During this period he also wrote two books, both of which were memoirs of his professional life combined with discussions of history and policy. One was titled Honorable Men: My Life in the CIA; the other, on Vietnam and his long involvement with American policy there, was called Lost Victory. In the latter book, Colby argued that the U.S.‚ÄìRVN counterinsurgency campaign in Vietnam had succeeded by the early 1970s and that South Vietnam could have survived had the U.S. continued to provide support after the Paris Accords. Though the topic remains open and controversial, some recent scholarship, including by Lewis \\"Bob\\" Sorley, supports Colby's arguments. Colby also lent his expertise and knowledge, along with Oleg Kalugin, to the Activision game Spycraft: The Great Game, which was released shortly before his death. Both Colby and Kalugin played themselves in the game. William E. Colby was a member of the National Coalition to Ban Handguns. His name appears on a note to Senator John Heinz dated July 5, 1989 as a \\"National Sponsor\\". Death On April 27, 1996, Colby set out from his weekend home in Rock Point, Maryland on a solo canoe trip. His canoe was found the following day on a sandbar in the Wicomico River, a tributary of the Potomac, approximately a from his home. On May 6, Colby's body was found in a marshy riverbank lying facedown not far from where his canoe was found. After an autopsy, Maryland's Chief Medical Examiner John E. Smialek ruled his death to be accidental. Smialek's report noted that Colby was predisposed to having a heart attack or stroke due to \\"severe calcified atherosclerosis\\" and that Colby likely \\"suffered a complication of this atherosclerosis which precipitated him into the cold water in a debilitated state and he succumbed to the effects of hypothermia and drowned\\". Colby's death triggered conspiracy theories that his death was due to foul play. In his 2011 documentary The Man Nobody Knew, Colby's son Carl suggested that his father suffered from guilt due to his actions in the CIA and committed suicide. Carl's step-mother and siblings, as well as Colby's biographer Randall Woods, criticized Carl's portrayal of William Colby, and rejected the allegation that the former CIA director killed himself citing it as being inconsistent with his character. Legacy Colby was the subject of a biography, Lost Crusader, by John Prados, published in 2003. His son, Carl Colby, released a documentary on his father's professional and personal life, The Man Nobody Knew, in 2011. In May 2013, Randall B. Woods, Distinguished Professor of History at the J. William Fulbright School at the University of Arkansas, published his biography of Colby, titled Shadow Warrior: William Egan Colby and the CIA.

Colligative properties of Solutions\\" General Chemistry Mill Valley: Library of Congress, 2011. . The number ratio can be related to the various units for concentration of a solution, for example, molarity, molality, normality (chemistry), etc. The assumption that solution properties are independent of nature of solute particles is exact only for ideal solutions, and is approximate for dilute real solutions. In other words, colligative properties are a set of solution properties that can be reasonably approximated by the assumption that the solution is ideal. Only properties which result from the dissolution of nonvolatile solute in a volatile liquid solvent are considered.KL Kapoor Applications of Thermodynamics Volume 3 They are essentially solvent properties which are changed by the presence of the solute. The solute particles displace some solvent molecules in the liquid phase and thereby reduce the concentration of solvent, so that the colligative properties are independent of the nature of the solute. The word colligative is derived from the Latin colligatus meaning bound together.K.J. Laidler and J.L. Meiser, Physical Chemistry (Benjamin/Cummings 1982), p.196 This indicates that all colligative properties have a common feature, namely that they are related only to the number of solute molecules relative to the number of solvent molecules and not to the nature of the solute. Colligative properties include: * Relative lowering of vapour pressure (Raoult's law) * Elevation of boiling point * Depression of freezing point * Osmotic pressure For a given solute-solvent mass ratio, all colligative properties are inversely proportional to solute molar mass. Measurement of colligative properties for a dilute solution of a non-ionized solute such as urea or glucose in water or another solvent can lead to determinations of relative molar masses, both for small molecules and for polymers which cannot be studied by other means. Alternatively, measurements for ionized solutes can lead to an estimation of the percentage of dissociation taking place. Colligative properties are studied mostly for dilute solutions, whose behavior may be approximated as that of an ideal solution. In fact, all of the properties listed above are colligative only in the dilute limit: at higher concentrations, the freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, vapour pressure elevation or depression, and osmotic pressure are all dependent on the chemical nature of the solvent and the solute. Relative lowering of vapour pressure The vapour pressure of a liquid is the pressure of the vapour which is in equilibrium with that liquid. The vapour pressure of a solvent is lowered when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in it to form a solution. For an ideal solution, the equilibrium vapour pressure is given by Raoult's law as :p = p^{\\\\star}_{\\\\rm A} x_{\\\\rm A} + p^{\\\\star}_{\\\\rm B} x_{\\\\rm B} + \\\\cdots, where p^{\\\\star}_{\\\\rm i} is the vapor pressure of the pure component (i= A, B, ...) and x_{\\\\rm i} is the mole fraction of the component in the solution For a solution with a solvent (A) and one non-volatile solute (B), p^{\\\\star}_{\\\\rm B} = 0 and p = p^{\\\\star}_{\\\\rm A} x_{\\\\rm A} The vapour pressure lowering relative to pure solvent is \\\\Delta p = p^{\\\\star}_{\\\\rm A} - p = p^{\\\\star}_{\\\\rm A} (1 - x_{\\\\rm A}) = p^{\\\\star}_{\\\\rm A} x_{\\\\rm B}, which is proportional to the mole fraction of solute. If the solute dissociates in solution, then the number of moles of solute is increased by the van 't Hoff factor i, which represents the true number of solute particles for each formula unit. For example, the strong electrolyte MgCl2 dissociates into one Mg2+ ion and two Cl‚àí ions, so that if ionization is complete, i = 3 and \\\\Delta p = p^{\\\\star}_{\\\\rm A} x_{\\\\rm B}, where x_{\\\\rm B} is calculated with moles of solute i times initial moles and moles of solvent same as initial moles of solvent before dissociation. The measured colligative properties show that i is somewhat less than 3 due to ion association.  Boiling point and freezing point  Addition of solute to form a solution stabilizes the solvent in the liquid phase, and lowers the solvent chemical potential so that solvent molecules have less tendency to move to the gas or solid phases. As a result, liquid solutions slightly above the solvent boiling point at a given pressure become stable, which means that the boiling point increases. Similarly, liquid solutions slightly below the solvent freezing point become stable meaning that the freezing point decreases. Both the boiling point elevation and the freezing point depression are proportional to the lowering of vapour pressure in a dilute solution. These properties are colligative in systems where the solute is essentially confined to the liquid phase. Boiling point elevation (like vapour pressure lowering) is colligative for non-volatile solutes where the solute presence in the gas phase is negligible. Freezing point depression is colligative for most solutes since very few solutes dissolve appreciably in solid solvents.  Boiling point elevation (ebullioscopy)  The boiling point of a liquid at a given external pressure is the temperature (T_{\\\\rm b}) at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure. The normal boiling point is the boiling point at a pressure equal to 1 atm. The boiling point of a pure solvent is increased by the addition of a non-volatile solute, and the elevation can be measured by ebullioscopy. It is found that :\\\\Delta T_{\\\\rm b} = T_{\\\\rm b}(solution) - T_{\\\\rm b}(solvent) = i\\\\cdot K_b \\\\cdot m Here i is the van 't Hoff factor as above, Kb is the ebullioscopic constant of the solvent (equal to 0.512 ¬∞C kg/mol for water), and m is the molality of the solution. The boiling point is the temperature at which there is equilibrium between liquid and gas phases. At the boiling point, the number of gas molecules condensing to liquid equals the number of liquid molecules evaporating to gas. Adding a solute dilutes the concentration of the liquid molecules and reduces the rate of evaporation. To compensate for this and re-attain equilibrium, the boiling point occurs at a higher temperature. If the solution is assumed to be an ideal solution, Kb can be evaluated from the thermodynamic condition for liquid-vapor equilibrium. At the boiling point the chemical potential ŒºA of the solvent in the solution phase equals the chemical potential in the pure vapor phase above the solution. :\\\\mu _A(T_b) = \\\\mu_A^{\\\\star}(T_b) + RT\\\\ln x_A\\\\ = \\\\mu_A^{\\\\star}(g, 1 atm), where the asterisks indicate pure phases. This leads to the result K_b = RMT_b^2/\\\\Delta H_{\\\\mathrm{vap}}, where R is the molar gas constant, M is the solvent molar mass and ŒîHvap is the solvent molar enthalpy of vaporization.T. Engel and P. Reid, Physical Chemistry (Pearson Benjamin Cummings 2006) p.204-5  Freezing point depression (cryoscopy) The freezing point (T_{\\\\rm f}) of a pure solvent is lowered by the addition of a solute which is insoluble in the solid solvent, and the measurement of this difference is called cryoscopy. It is found that :\\\\Delta T_{\\\\rm f} = T_{\\\\rm f}(solution) - T_{\\\\rm f}(solvent) = - i\\\\cdot K_f \\\\cdot m Here Kf is the cryoscopic constant (equal to 1.86 ¬∞C kg/mol for the freezing point of water), i is the van 't Hoff factor, and m the molality. In the liquid solution, the solvent is diluted by the addition of a solute, so that fewer molecules are available to freeze. Re-establishment of equilibrium is achieved at a lower temperature at which the rate of freezing becomes equal to the rate of liquefying. At the lower freezing point, the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the vapor pressure of the corresponding solid, and the chemical potentials of the two phases are equal as well. The equality of chemical potentials permits the evaluation of the cryoscopic constant as K_f = RMT_f^2/\\\\Delta H_{\\\\mathrm{fus}}, where ŒîHfus is the solvent molar enthalpy of fusion.  Osmotic pressure  The osmotic pressure of a solution is the difference in pressure between the solution and the pure liquid solvent when the two are in equilibrium across a semipermeable membrane, which allows the passage of solvent molecules but not of solute particles. If the two phases are at the same initial pressure, there is a net transfer of solvent across the membrane into the solution known as osmosis. The process stops and equilibrium is attained when the pressure difference equals the osmotic pressure. Two laws governing the osmotic pressure of a dilute solution were discovered by the German botanist W. F. P. Pfeffer and the Dutch chemist J. H. van‚Äôt Hoff: # The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution at constant temperature is directly proportional to its concentration. # The osmotic pressure of a solution is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. These are analogous to Boyle's law and Charles's Law for gases. Similarly, the combined ideal gas law, pV = nRT, has as analog for ideal solutions \\\\Pi V = n R T i, where \\\\Pi is osmotic pressure; V is the volume; n is the number of moles of solute; R is the molar gas constant 8.314 J K‚àí1 mol‚àí1; T is absolute temperature; and i is the Van 't Hoff factor. The osmotic pressure is then proportional to the molar concentration c = n/V, since :\\\\Pi = \\\\frac {n R T i}{V} = c R T i The osmotic pressure is proportional to the concentration of solute particles ci and is therefore a colligative property. As with the other colligative properties, this equation is a consequence of the equality of solvent chemical potentials of the two phases in equilibrium. In this case the phases are the pure solvent at pressure P and the solution at total pressure (P + œÄ).Engel and Reid p.207 History The word colligative (Latin: co, ligare) was introduced in 1891 by Wilhelm Ostwald. Ostwald classified solute properties in three categories:W.B. Jensen, J. Chem. Educ. 75, 679 (1998) Logic, History, and the Chemistry Textbook I. Does Chemistry Have a Logical Structure?H.W. Smith, Circulation 21, 808 (1960) Theory of Solutions: A Knowledge of the Laws of Solutions ... # colligative properties which depend only on solute concentration and temperature, and are independent of the nature of the solute particles # additive properties such as mass, which are the sums of properties of the constituent particles and therefore depend also on the composition (or molecular formula) of the solute, and # constitutional properties which depend further on the molecular structure of the given solute.

Rose was born in Washington, D.C.; his parents were immigrants from Kyiv, Ukraine. Rose took lessons from Walter Grossman, Frank Miller and Felix Salmond and after completing his studies at Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music at age 20, he joined Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra, and almost immediately became associate principal. At 21 he was principal cellist of the Cleveland Orchestra and at 26 was the principal of the New York Philharmonic. He made many recordings as a soloist after 1951, including concertos with conductors such as Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Ormandy, George Szell and Bruno Walter among others. Rose also joined with Isaac Stern and Eugene Istomin in a celebrated piano trio. Rose's legacy as a teacher remains to this day: his students from the Juilliard School, Curtis Institute and Ivan Galamian's Meadowmount Summer School fill the sections of many American orchestras, notably those of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic. His pupils include Lori Singer, Raymond Davis, Desmond Hoebig, Peter Stumpf, Fred Sherry, Christopher von Baeyer, Myung-wha Chung, Patrick Sohn, Thomas Demenga, Stephen Kates, Lynn Harrell, Yehuda Hanani, Hans J√∏rgen Jensen, Steven Honigberg, Eric Kim, Roger Drinkall, Robert deMaine, Bruce Uchimura, Donald Whitton, Yo-Yo Ma, Ronald Leonard, Steven Pologe, Sara Sant'Ambrogio, Matt Haimovitz, Mats Lidstr√∂m, Richard Hirschl, John Sant‚ÄôAmbrogio, and Marijane Carr Siegal. He played an Amati cello dated 1662, played today by Gary Hoffman. Rose died in White Plains, New York, of leukemia. In November 2009, a memorial marker was placed for Rose in the Mt. Ararat Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York, next to the grave of his first wife, Minnie Knopow Rose, who died in 1964. Minnie and Leonard met at Curtis, where she studied viola. His second wife was Xenia Petschek, whom he married in January 1965. Xenia Rose died in 2002.

She was given the English name of Constance, also being known as Connie Wong Ong.  Biography  Wong was born and raised in San Francisco; she was the fifth daughter of an immigrant family which grew to have nine children. She was raised with the traditional beliefs and customs of Chinese culture which her family and her elders imposed upon her. Her father forbade her to date and refused to pay for her college education. She was determined to get higher education, first attending San Francisco Junior College, and later Mills College, where she majored in economics and sociology in the hope of becoming a social worker in Chinatown. Wong graduated from Mills College in 1942 with a hard-earned Phi Beta Kappa key. She worked as a secretary during World War II; she had discovered a talent for ceramics in a summer course at Mills and she joined a Ceramics Guild associated with the college.Jade Snow Wong (1950/1965), Fifth Chinese Daughter, reprint, Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin, Ch. 27, \\"A Life Plan Is Cast\\", p. 273. When she began to sell her work from a shop in Chinatown, it quickly found popularity. Wong married the artist Woodrow Ong in 1950; they worked together on their art and later managed a travel agency together. Throughout her lifetime, Wong worked with many organizations including the San Francisco Public Library, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, the Chinese Cultural Center, the Chinese Historical Society of America, and Mills College. Wong was recognized and awarded by Mills College with an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Arts in 1976. Wong died on March 16, 2006 at the age of 84 of cancer; she was survived by her two daughters, two sons,Jade Snow Wong (1950/1965), Fifth Chinese Daughter, reprint, Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin, \\"About the Author\\", p. [285]. and four grandchildren.  Literary Work In 1950, Wong published the first of her two autobiographical volumes, Fifth Chinese Daughter. The book described her troubles balancing her identity as an Asian American woman and her Chinese Traditions. The book was translated into several Asian languages by the U.S. State Department, which sent her on a four-month speaking tour of Asia in 1953. \\"I was sent,\\" Wong wrote, \\"because those Asian audiences who had read translations of Fifth Chinese Daughter did not believe a female born to poor Chinese immigrants could gain a toehold among prejudiced Americans.\\" Her second volume, No Chinese Stranger, was published in 1975.The book described her trip across Asia during her speaking tour and her visits to the People‚Äôs Republic of China. In 1976, Wong‚Äôs first volume, Fifth Chinese Daughter, was made into a half-hour special for public television. Artistic work  Wong's career in pottery took off after she convinced a merchant on Grant Avenue in Chinatown, San Francisco, to allow her to put her workshop in his store window.Jade Snow Wong (1950/1965), Fifth Chinese Daughter, reprint, Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin, Ch. 28, \\"'The Work of One Day Is Gazed Upon for One Thousand Days'\\", pp. 278--280. Her ceramics were later displayed in art museums across the United States, including a 2002 exhibition at the Chinese Historical Society of America. They were also displayed at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Art Institute of Chicago (a one-woman show), the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, and the Cincinnati Art Museum, as well as shows in Omaha, Nebraska, and Portland, Oregon. In addition to these shows across the United States, Wong's ceramics have also been placed in the permanent collections of New York‚Äôs Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Oakland Museum of California, the Joslyn Art Museum, and the International Ceramic Museum in Italy.

It is primarily undergraduate and residential, enrolling full-time students of traditional college age. The university also serves some commuting, part-time, and adult students on-campus and through distance-learning programs. The university offers a limited number of master's and doctoral level graduate programs including Bible, Business, Counseling and Education. Arts, science, and professional degrees are conferred. The university is governed by a board of trustees, all of whom are required to be members of Churches of Christ. Courses are offered by 12 academic departments organized into six schools: Arts and Humanities, Biblical Studies, Business, Education, Sciences and Mathematics, and the Honors College. Freed-Hardeman offers European study abroad programs based out of the FHU facility in Verviers, Belgium during the fall and spring semesters. A study abroad and Spanish-language immersion program is offered in Madrid, Spain, during most summer semesters. Other opportunities include two and three week study programs in Israel, Costa Rica, New York City, Stratford, Canada, and Seoul, South Korea. History The Bell Tower Freed-Hardeman traces its origin to the 1869 charter of a private high school and college for Henderson, the Henderson Male Institute. It was known at various times as the Henderson Masonic Male and Female Institute, West Tennessee Christian College and Georgie Robertson Christian College. It was named Georgie Robertson Christian College after George Ann \\"Georgie\\" Robertson, the daughter of J. F. Robertson and his wife the former Lucy Alice Hamlett. When Georgie died at age 21 her parents donated $5000 to West Tennessee Christian College in her memory and so the school was renamed after her. In the spring term of 1907, Georgie Robertson Christian College closed down. N. B. Hardeman, a Georgie Robertson Christian College alumnus, and A. G. Freed worked together to establish a new school, the National Teachers' Normal and Business College to fill the educational void created in Henderson by the closing of GRCC. The NTNBC was incorporated on May 21, 1907, but classes did not start until the fall of 1908. In 1919, it was renamed Freed-Hardeman College in honor of its founders. In February 1990, it became Freed‚ÄìHardeman University. The college did not accept African-American students until 1964, when President Hubert A. Dixon stated black students would be admitted in response \\"to the mistake of accepting federal funds.\\" The first black graduate was Elizabeth Saunders in 1967.https://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/local/2018/08/17/freed-hardemans- first-black-grad-bell-master/37517853/ The university offers courses/degrees at two sites outside of the Henderson area‚Äîin Memphis, TN and Dickson, TN. During the 2019-20 academic year, the university celebrated its 150th Anniversary. In conjunction with the anniversary, a significant volume of university history (By the Grace of God: The Story of Freed-Hardeman University) was published. Dormitories All students at Freed‚ÄìHardeman University must live on campus unless approved by the administration.FHU Student Handbook http://www.fhu.edu/Libraries/SFcatalog_Main/2014-2015_Undergraduate_Catalog.sflb.ashx Generally these approvals are under special circumstances including, but not limited to, age, marriage, disability, or academic purposes. Students must be at least 22 years of age to apply for off campus housing unless otherwise approved by administration. The late Milan-Sitka Building, 1904, during which it was Georgie Robertson Christian College. The university has five women's dormitories. Hall-Roland Hall (originally Oakland Hall) is the oldest residence hall, capable of housing 62. The ground floor houses Graduate Studies in Counseling and the Department of Behavioral and Consumer Sciences. H. A. Dixon Hall is a four-story dormitory opened in 1958. It can house 136 women. Thomas E. and LaVonne B. Scott Hall opened in 1971 and can house 152 women. In 1973 W. A. Bradfield Hall opened, housing 144 women. Porter-Terry Hall opened in 1977 and can house 156 women. There are four men's dormitories. Paul Gray Hall was built in 1929 and can house 128 men on four floors, yet is no longer in service as a dormitory. Opened in 1970, George S. Benson Hall can accommodate 152 men. Farrow Hall opened in 1973 and has a capacity for 178 men. Sewell Hall opened on January 13, 2007 and can house 200 men. Upon the opening of Sewell Hall, L. L. Brigance Hall, which could house 78 men, was demolished in 2013.http://www.fhu.edu/seasons/masterplan_sp14.aspx Two additional residence halls were built in 2003: Tyler Residence Hall (for Women) and the Woods-East Residence Hall (for Men). These Residence halls are considered Privileged housing. Privileged housing is open only to upperclassmen. Students wishing to live in Privileged housing must complete an application and meet certain requirements including a 3.1 GPA. The rooms in these residence halls have four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen (with a microwave, oven, stove, and refrigerator), a washer and dryer, and a living room. Four students share this living space, each one with their own bedroom, and sharing a bathroom with one roommate. Campus buildings The National Teacher's Normal and Business College Administration Building now known as the Old Administration Building, also affectionately called \\"Old Main,\\" is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Student Center opened in 1966 and houses a variety of food services and recreational rooms. The first floor houses the Burks Center. The center contains a food center, post office, Career Resource Center, Student Association office, Student Services office, and Office of Student Life and Development. The main cafeteria, Wallace-Gano Dining Hall, is located on the second floor. The food service is operated by Sodexo. Clayton Chapel, a red brick and stained glass building located on University Street, opened in 1992. It has a capacity of approximately 100. It may be reserved for devotionals and weddings. The Brown-Kopel Business Center, was the start of many technology additions to the classroom that eventually began to be added to classrooms in other buildings. This is also where the majority of non-biblical classes are taken. The Bulliner-Clayton Visual Arts Center opened in Fall 2007. Each year this building houses senior art exhibits, as well as many alum, local, and other art exhibits. This also is where the fine arts classes are held, except those that are music related, and can range from photography, painting, drawing, and graphic design. The Brewers Sports Center is the athletic center of Freed‚ÄìHardeman University. This building has three racquetball courts, two basketball courts, a weight training room, walking track, and offices for the Athletic Department administration. The Anderson Science Center was built in 2012. Money was given by alumnus Tom Anderson to create the facility which houses a large portion of the science department. Future plans include an expansion and renovation of the Associates Science Center to facilitate and house the new nursing program. Loyd Auditorium is the main auditorium on campus and is used for many of the activities on campus, including: Makin' Music, Daily Chapel, FHU Lectureships, sports banquet speakers, benefit dinner speakers, and the annual Homecoming Play. The auditorium can seat approximately 3,000 people. It consists of a lower bowl as well as a balcony that is split into four sections and can be separated by large curtains. The Hope Barber Shull Academic Resource Center, opened in 2016, houses the Loden-Daniel Library, KC's Coffeehouse, and the university tutoring center, named in honor of longtime librarian Hope Barber Shull. Aside from the main buildings, Freed-Hardeman also has several recreational areas on campus. The weight room in Brewer's Sports Center is often overcrowded by the various student athletes, so many students go to the Main Street Student Gym a block west of Old Main. Across from Old Main is a campus theater named Crews Colbert Activity Center (or simply Crews). Crews has two theaters labeled \\"Maroon Theater\\" and \\"Gold Theater\\", and above the theaters is a large activity room used for open space activities and meetings. Next door to Crews is the Blackbox Theatre. This theatre is used for drama classes as well as all the plays put on by the theatre department each year aside from the Homecoming play. Student life Full-time students are required to take at least one Bible class every semester and attend a daily chapel service. Freed-Hardeman does not have fraternities and sororities in the traditional sense. Instead the university has co-ed social clubs. These social clubs are local only to Freed-Hardeman and have no connection to any national Greek system. These include Sigma Rho, Phi Kappa Alpha, Chi Beta Chi, Xi Chi Delta, and Theta Nu. Students participate in intramural sports, club meetings, and devotionals with their respective clubs. Sigma Rho and Phi Kappa Alpha are the only original social clubs remaining of the original 5 that were on campus, as well as being the two oldest. Sigma Rho has been on Campus for 104 years (celebrating their 100-year anniversary in 2012) and Phi Kappa Alpha has been on Campus for 77 years (celebrating their 75-year anniversary in 2014). Other University Organizations include: Student Government Association, \\"The Pride\\", Campus Delegate Team, University Program Council, Student Alumni Association, University Chorale, Ambassadors, Art Guild, Students in Free Enterprise, Law Society, Lambda Pi Eta, Society for Future Accountants, Social Work Students in Action, National Broadcast Society, Communications Majors and Minors Association (COMMA), Pied Pipers, For Heaven's Sake, Pi Epsilon, Alpha Chi, Dactylology Club, Right to Life, Tabitha Club, Preacher's Club, Evangelism Forum, Psychological Affiliation, Math & Computer Science Club, Biology Club, WFHU 91.5 FM, TV40, and the Treasure Chest. The school's newspaper was originally called the Skyrocket and was begun in 1923. The newspaper was renamed the New Edition briefly in 1972. After a name selection contest, it was renamed the Bell Tower and is published 12 times throughout the year. The school's yearbook is called the Treasure Chest. The yearbook is now issued in the form of a DVD and is accompanied by a photo directory. The University's radio station, WFHU, 91-FIVE, is the 10,500-watt FM stereo station. Spiritual life Campus-Wide devotionals are held every Monday and Thursday nights at 10:30 pm. Gazebo singings were organized every Sunday night at 10:00 pm in the gazebo on Main Street. (the Gazebo was moved to the local park in the Spring of 2012) Every other Wednesday Night at 10:00 pm, students meet in Clayton Chapel for Clayton Chapel Singing. Rankings U.S. News & World Report ranked Freed-Hardeman 35th among Southern master's degree- granting universities in its 2013 overall rankings. It also included the school in its separate affordability ranking (\\"Great Schools, Great Prices\\"), listing it 13th among Southern master's degree-granting universities. The University reported a 44% acceptance rate of applicants for the fall 2012 semester. Annual benefit dinner and speaker Each year, on the first Friday in December, the university hosts a fundraising dinner featuring well-known speakers, such as Baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken, Jr., former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George H. W. Bush, TV personality Regis Philbin, retired General Norman Schwarzkopf, Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton, Senator Elizabeth Dole, former US Senate Majority Leader and physician, Dr. Bill Frist, popular radio commentator Paul Harvey, NBC Today Show weatherman Willard Scott, NFL football player, commentator & actor Merlin Olsen, country comedian Jerry Clower, former Alabama head coach Gene Stallings, historic CBS- TV News anchor and reporter Walter Cronkite, former First Lady Barbara Bush, former NBC News Anchor and former Meet the Press moderator Tom Brokaw and most recently Emmy Award-winning comedian Tim Conway. On Saturday, May 15, 2010, Freed‚ÄìHardeman University announced that the featured speaker for the 2010 Annual Benefit Dinner would be former President George W. Bush, 43rd president of the United States of America (January 20, 2001 ‚Äì January 20, 2009). Robby Novak, aka Kid President, was an MC at this event Athletics Freed‚ÄìHardeman teams, nicknamed athletically as the Lions, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Division I level, primarily competing in the American Midwest Conference. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, and soccer; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross-country, golf, soccer, softball and volleyball. In 2014 men's basketball coach Jason Shelton was awarded the Don Meyer Award, presented annually to the top NAIA coach in college basketball. On March 20, 2018, the Lady Lions basketball team captured their first NAIA Championship. The Lady Lions defeated Westmont 76‚Äì64. Annual FHU Lectureship Every year the University hosts the FHU Lectureship on campus. This is considered by some to be the most significant and largest meeting of the Churches of Christ. However, since the Churches of Christ have no official headquarterssee Churches of Christ this cannot be confirmed. The lectureship has been a tradition since 1936, beginning as a way for preachers who could not afford a formal education to come to Freed-Hardeman and learn from professors without the pressure of grades and tuition. However, now they are more of a way to come together and hear people preach, rather than teaching how to preach. Many young preachers come today, but also many alum do as well. Most of the lectureships from 1950s to today have been manuscripted and are on file in the FHU Library or can be purchased in PDF form in the Bible Book Store. On the Monday evening of Lectureship week, there is a dinner to honor a person of importance to Freed-Hardeman and the Churches of Christ. Although a large portion of the attendees are visitors and alumni of the university, students are encouraged to attend as many lectures as possible. A separate Student Lectureship is also held during the Fall and Spring semesters. Notable alumni and faculty *Carl Bell, guitarist and songwriter for the band Fuel *George S.

He was educated at the Royal College of San Carlos, but left without finishing his studies. During the British Invasions he served as Third Lieutenant of the Galicia Volunteers. He participated in the open Cabildo on May 22, 1810 voting for the deposition of the viceroy. He had a strong influence on the First Triumvirate and shortly after he served as Minister of Government and Foreign Affairs of the Province of Buenos Aires. Although there was a General Congress intended to draft a constitution, the beginning of the War with Brazil led to the immediate establishment of the office of President of Argentina; with Rivadavia being the first to be named to the post. Argentina's Constitution of 1826 was promulgated later, but was rejected by the provinces. Strongly contested by his political party, Rivadavia resigned and was succeeded by Vicente L√≥pez y Planes. Rivadavia retired to Spain, where he died in 1845. His remains were repatriated to Argentina in 1857, receiving honors as Captain General. Today his remains rest in a mausoleum located in Plaza Miserere, adjacent to Rivadavia Avenue, named after him. Biography= Early life  Rivadavia was born in Buenos Aires on May 20, 1780, the fourth son of Benito Bernardino Gonz√°lez de Rivadavia, a wealthy Galician lawyer, and his first wife Mar√≠a Josefa de Jes√∫s Rodr√≠guez de Rivadeneyra. On December 14, 1809, he married Juana del Pino y Vera Mujica, daughter of the viceroy of the R√≠o de la Plata, Joaqu√≠n del Pino and his second wife, the vicereine Rafaela Francisca de Vera Mujica y L√≥pez Pintado. His military appointment was rejected by Mariano Moreno.  Career  Rivadavia was active in both the Argentine resistance to the British invasion of 1806 and in the May Revolution movement for Argentine Independence in 1810. In 1811, Rivadavia became the dominant member of the governing triumvirate as Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of War. Until its fall in October 1812, this government focused on creating a strong central government, moderating relations with Spain, and organizing an army. By 1814 the Spanish King Ferdinand VII had returned to the throne and started the Absolutist Restoration, which had grave consequences for the governments in the Americas. Manuel Belgrano and Rivadavia were sent to Europe to seek support for the United Provinces from both Spain and Britain. They sought to promote the crowning of Francisco de Paula, son of Charles IV of Spain, as regent of the United Provinces, but in the end he refused to act against the interests of the King of Spain. The diplomatic mission was a failure, both in Spain and in Britain. He visited France as well, and returned to Buenos Aires in 1821, at their friends' request.Luna, pp. 7-24 During his stay in Britain, Rivadavia saw the growing development of the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of Romanticism. He sought to promote a similar development in Buenos Aires, and invited many people to move to the city. He convinced Aim√© Bonpland to visit the country, but few other invitations were accepted.Luna, pp. 18-21 In June 1821, he was named minister of government to Buenos Aires by governor Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez. Over the next five years, he exerted a strong influence, and focused heavily on improving the city of Buenos Aires, often at the expense of greater Argentina. To make the former look more European, Rivadavia constructed large avenues, schools, paved and lighted streets. He founded the University of Buenos Aires, as well as the Theatre, Geology, and Medicine Academies and the continent's first museum of natural science. He persuaded the legislature to authorize a one-million pound loan for public works that were never undertaken. The provincial bonds were sold in London through the Baring Brothers Bank, local and Buenos Aires-based British traders also acting as financial intermediaries. The borrowed money was in turn lent to these businessmen, who never repaid it. Of the original million pounds the Buenos Aires government received only ¬£552,700. The province's foreign debt was transferred to the nation in 1825, its final repayment being made in 1904. A strong supporter of a powerful, centralized government in Argentina, Rivadavia often faced violent resistance from the opposition federalists. In 1826, Rivadavia was elected the first President of Argentina. During his term he founded many museums, and expanded the national library. Presidency His government had many problems, primarily an ongoing war with Brazil over territory in modern Uruguay and resistance from provincial authorities. Faced with the rising power of the Federalist Party and with several provinces in open revolt, Rivadavia submitted his resignation on June 27, 1827. He was succeeded by Vicente L√≥pez y Planes. At first he returned to private life, but fled to exile in Europe in 1829. Rivadavia returned to Argentina in 1834 to confront his political enemies, but was immediately sentenced again to exile. He went first to Brazil and then to Spain, where he died on September 2, 1845. He asked that his body would never be brought back to Buenos Aires. Legacy Rivadavia is portrayed on Argentina stamps since 1864. Rivadavia is recognized as the first president of Argentina, even though his rule was accepted only in Buenos Aires, he did not complete a full mandate, there was no constitution for more than half of his rule, and did not start a presidential succession line.Mendelevich, p. 23 The chair of the President of Argentina is known as the \\"chair of Rivadavia\\", but only metaphorically: Rivadavia took everything when he left office, including the chair, which could never be retrieved. Liberal historians praise Rivadavia as a great historical man, for his work improving education, culture and separation of church and state. Revisionist authors condemn his Anglophilia, the weak customs barriers that allowed the entry of big British imports, harming the weak Argentine economy of the time, and the Baring Brothers loan that started the Argentine external debt.Mendelevich, p. 25 Bibliography * * ReferencesExternal links * Biography at El Historiador Category:1780 births Category:1845 deaths Category:Presidents of Argentina Category:Foreign ministers of Argentina Category:People of the Cisplatine War Category:People of the Argentine War of Independence Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine people of Spanish descent Category:Argentine monarchists Category:Unitarianists (Argentina) ","title":"Bernardino Rivadavia"},{"id":"456266","text":"A Technics SL-1200 turntable, the direct-drive model most widely used in DJing. A direct-drive turntable is one of the three main phonograph designs currently being produced. The other styles are the belt-drive turntable and the idler-wheel type. Each name is based upon the type of coupling used between the platter of the turntable and the motor. Direct-drive turntables are currently the most popular phonographs, due to their widespread use for turntablism in DJ culture. Panasonic's Technics series were the first direct- drive turntables, and remain the most popular series of turntables.  Design  In a direct-drive turntable the motor is located directly under the center of the platter and is connected to the platter directly. It is a significant advancement over older belt-drive turntables, which are unsuitable for turntablism, since they have a slow start-up time, and are prone to wear-and- tear and breakage,Brian Coleman, The Technics 1200 ‚Äî Hammer Of The Gods, Medium as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching.The World of DJs and the Turntable Culture, page 43, Hal Leonard Corporation, 2003 A direct-drive turntable eliminates belts, and instead employs a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.Trevor Pinch, Karin Bijsterveld, The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies, page 515, Oxford University Press This makes scratching possible, as the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggles the record back and forth on the platter.Six Machines That Changed The Music World, Wired, May 2002 On the other hand, direct-drive turntables may suffer from vibration due to the motor, which is less of an issue for belt-drive turntables. However, in recent years, shock-absorbing (less dense) material, placed between the motor and platter, has been used to cut back on vibrations. The torque on direct-drive turntables is usually much higher than on belt drive models. This means the platter speed is less susceptible to outside forces (stylus, hand). Higher torque also means the platter will accelerate to its proper speed faster so less distortion is heard when the record begins to play. Some direct-drive turntables further reduce the separation of motor and platter by using the platter itself as the rotor in the turntable's synchronous motor. This means that there is no motor, per se, in the turntable - the platter is entirely driven by the magnetic field induced by the turntable's stator. In all turntables a motor spins a metal disk at a constant speed. On top of the rotating disk (platter) is a mat and on top of the mat records are placed to be played. In the past rubber mats were used to hold the record in place so that it would not rotate independently of the platter. Nowadays slipmats are used to reduce the friction between the spinning platter and record, and is often made of a felt-like material. This way a DJ can scratch the record while the platter continues to spin underneath. In direct-drive turntables, the slipmat also helps isolate the record from motor vibrations that would be picked up by the stylus. Many turntables also include a pitch control, for fine tuning to the correct speed, used in conjunction with a strobe light, plus it also allows a DJ to mix using a technique known as beatmatching. From the late 1990s onwards manufacturers such as Vestax started to include other electronic controls such as reverse, and \\"nudge\\". DJs and turntablists use all the above functions to assist them in musical performances. History The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic),Billboard, May 21, 1977, page 140 based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables. In 1971, Matsushita released the Technics SL-1100. Due to its strong motor, durability, and fidelity, it was adopted by early hip hop artists. A forefather of turntablism was DJ Kool Herc, an immigrant from Jamaica to New York City. He introduced turntable techniques from Jamaican dub music,Nicholas Collins, Margaret Schedel, Scott Wilson (2013), Electronic Music: Cambridge Introductions to Music, page 105, Cambridge University Press while developing new techniques made possible by the direct-drive turntable technology of the Technics SL-1100, which he used for the first sound system he set up after emigrating to New York. The signature technique he developed was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation to extend the b-dancers' favorite section, switching back and forth between the two to loop the breaks to a rhythmic beat. The most influential turntable was the Technics SL-1200, which was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972. It was adopted by New York City hip hop DJs such as Grand Wizzard Theodore and Afrika Bambaataa in the 1970s. As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed scratching techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. Since then, turntablism spread widely in hip hop culture, and the SL-1200 remained the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for the next several decades. Technics also introduced the first direct-drive tangential-arm turntable, the model SL-10, in 1981.

The essential difference from celestial mechanics is that each star contributes more or less equally to the total gravitational field, whereas in celestial mechanics the pull of a massive body dominates any satellite orbits. Historically, the methods utilized in stellar dynamics originated from the fields of both classical mechanics and statistical mechanics. In essence, the fundamental problem of stellar dynamics is the N-body problem, where the N members refer to the members of a given stellar system. Given the large number of objects in a stellar system, stellar dynamics is usually concerned with the more global, statistical properties of several orbits rather than with the specific data on the positions and velocities of individual orbits. The motions of stars in a galaxy or in a globular cluster are principally determined by the average distribution of the other, distant stars. Stellar encounters involve processes such as relaxation, mass segregation, tidal forces, and dynamical friction that influence the trajectories of the system's members. Stellar dynamics also has connections to the field of plasma physics. The two fields underwent significant development during a similar time period in the early 20th century, and both borrow mathematical formalism originally developed in the field of fluid mechanics.  Key Concepts  Stellar dynamics involves determining the gravitational potential of a substantial number of stars. The stars can be modeled as point masses whose orbits are determined by the combined interactions with each other. Typically, these point masses represent stars in a variety of clusters or galaxies, such as a Galaxy cluster, or a Globular cluster. From Newton's second law an equation describing the interactions of an isolated stellar system can be written down as, m_i\\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf{r_i}}{dt} = \\\\sum_{i=1 \\\\atop i e j}^N \\\\frac{G m_i m_j \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j\\\\right\\\\^3} which is simply a formulation of the N-body problem. For an N-body system, any individual member, m_i is influenced by the gravitational potentials of the remaining m_j members. In practice, it is not feasible to calculate the system's gravitational potential by adding all of the point-mass potentials in the system, so stellar dynamicists develop potential models that can accurately model the system while remaining computationally inexpensive. The gravitational potential, \\\\Phi, of a system is related to the gravitational field, \\\\mathbf{\\\\vec{g}} by: \\\\mathbf{\\\\vec{g}} = - abla \\\\Phi whereas the mass density, \\\\rho , is related to the potential via Poisson's equation: abla^2\\\\Phi = 4\\\\pi G \\\\rho  Gravitational Encounters and Relaxation  Stars in a stellar system will influence each other's trajectories due to strong and weak gravitational encounters. An encounter between two stars is defined to be strong if the change in potential energy between the two is greater than or equal to their initial kinetic energy. Strong encounters are rare, and they are typically only considered important in dense stellar systems, such as the cores of globular clusters. Weak encounters have a more profound effect on the evolution of a stellar system over the course of many orbits. The effects of gravitational encounters can be studied with the concept of relaxation time. A simple example illustrating relaxation is two-body relaxation, where a star's orbit is altered due to the gravitational interaction with another star. Initially, the subject star travels along an orbit with initial velocity, \\\\mathbf{v}, that is perpendicular to the impact parameter, the distance of closest approach, to the field star whose gravitational field will affect the original orbit. Using Newton's laws, the change in the subject star's velocity, \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{v}, is approximately equal to the acceleration at the impact parameter, multiplied by the time duration of the acceleration. The relaxation time can be thought as the time it takes for \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{v} to equal \\\\mathbf{v}, or the time it takes for the small deviations in velocity to equal the star's initial velocity. The relaxation time for a stellar system of N objects is approximately equal to: t_{\\\\text{relax}} \\\\backsimeq \\\\frac{0.1N}{\\\\ln N}t_\\\\text{cross} where t_{\\\\text{cross}} is known as the crossing time, the time it takes for a star to travel across the galaxy once. The relaxation time identifies collisionless vs. collisional stellar systems. Dynamics on timescales less than the relaxation time are defined to be collisionless. They are also identified as systems where subject stars interact with a smooth gravitational potential as opposed to the sum of point-mass potentials. The accumulated effects of two-body relaxation in a galaxy can lead to what is known as mass segregation, where more massive stars gather near the center of clusters, while the less massive ones are pushed towards the outer parts of the cluster.  Connections to statistical mechanics and plasma physics  The statistical nature of stellar dynamics originates from the application of the kinetic theory of gases to stellar systems by physicists such as James Jeans in the early 20th century. The Jeans equations, which describe the time evolution of a system of stars in a gravitational field, are analogous to Euler's equations for an ideal fluid, and were derived from the collisionless Boltzmann equation. This was originally developed by Ludwig Boltzmann to describe the non-equilibrium behavior of a thermodynamic system. Similarly to statistical mechanics, stellar dynamics make use of distribution functions that encapsulate the information of a stellar system in a probabilistic manner. The single particle phase-space distribution function, f(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{v},t), is defined in a way such that f(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{v},t)\\\\,\\\\text{d}\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\,\\\\text{d}\\\\mathbf{v} represents the probability of finding a given star with position \\\\mathbf{x} around a differential volume \\\\text{d}\\\\mathbf{x} and velocity \\\\text{v} around a differential volume \\\\text{d}\\\\mathbf{v}. The distribution is function is normalized such that integrating it over all positions and velocities will equal unity. For collisional systems, Liouville's theorem is applied to study the microstate of a stellar system, and is also commonly used to study the different statistical ensembles of statistical mechanics. In plasma physics, the collisionless Boltzmann equation is referred to as the Vlasov equation, which is used to study the time evolution of a plasma's distribution function. Whereas Jeans applied the collisionless Boltzmann equation, along with Poisson's equation, to a system of stars interacting via the long range force of gravity, Anatoly Vlasov applied Boltzmann's equation with Maxwell's equations to a system of particles interacting via the Coulomb Force. Both approaches separate themselves from the kinetic theory of gases by introducing long-range forces to study the long term evolution of a many particle system. In addition to the Vlasov equation, the concept of Landau damping in plasmas was applied to gravitational systems by Donald Lynden-Bell to describe the effects of damping in spherical stellar systems.  Applications  Stellar dynamics is primarily used to study the mass distributions within stellar systems and galaxies. Early examples of applying stellar dynamics to clusters include Albert Einstein's 1921 paper applying the virial theorem to spherical star clusters and Fritz Zwicky's 1933 paper applying the virial theorem specifically to the Coma Cluster, which was one of the original harbingers of the idea of dark matter in the universe. The Jeans equations have been used to understand different observational data of stellar motions in the Milky Way galaxy. For example, Jan Oort utilized the Jeans equations to determine the average matter density in the vicinity of the solar neighborhood, whereas the concept of asymmetric drift came from studying the Jeans equations in cylindrical coordinates. Stellar dynamics also provides insight into the structure of galaxy formation and evolution. Dynamical models and observations are used to study the triaxial structure of elliptical galaxies and suggest that prominent spiral galaxies are created from galaxy mergers. Stellar dynamical models are also used to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei and their black holes, as well as to estimate the mass distribution of dark matter in galaxies.

There are three main types of phonograph turntable drives being manufactured today: the belt-drive, idler-wheel and direct-drive systems; the names are based upon the type of coupling used between the platter of the turntable and the motor. In a belt-drive turntable the motor is located off-center from the platter, either underneath it or entirely outside of it, and is connected to the platter or counter-platter by a drive belt made from elastomeric material. The design of the belt-drive turntable allows the use of a less expensive motor than the direct-drive turntable. Also, the elastomeric belt absorbs motor vibrations which would otherwise be picked up by the stylus. Rotational stability Rotational stability is a key goal for turntable design that produces quality output. Many belt-drive turntables with multiple speeds have mechanical devices or rely on manual effort to move the belt between different-sized pulleys on the motor shaft. Due to difficulties in designing multiple-speed synchronous motors whose speed can be controlled electronically, such turntables frequently have DC servomotors. The disadvantage of DC servomotors is that they rotate in steps rather than continuously - the resulting \\"cogging\\" can add noise during playback. Helical armature motors can be used to overcome this. Problems with belt instability and deterioration in the past have largely been solved by use of modern elastic polymers. Since the 1970s, DC motors have declined in popularity; high end audiophile turntable designs use the synchronous motor, which are smoother running and lower noise. Due to the existence of instabilities of mains electricity, manufacturers might try to ensure pitch stability by generating its own sinusoidal waveform to power their AC motor. Other methods at achieving stability include using optical sensors on the platter which feed back to the electronics; or use of fly wheel assemblies. Some manufacturers use mass to deal with the problem. Heavy platters, which have higher inertia, are thus less susceptible to minute speed variations. However, mass stores energy that may be difficult to control. Heavier platter also increases wear on the bearing. Belt-drive types Some turntables, such as the newer versions of the Rega Planar series, use a fixed plinth with a low vibration motor and bearing attached to the same flat surface, usually constructed of wood, metal or acrylic, without suspension. Others, such as the Linn Sondek LP12, have a suspension. Suspended-sub- chassis The three-point \\"suspended sub-chassis\\" was a design by renowned audio pioneer Edgar Villchur. It became the basis upon which his company created the Acoustic Research XA turntable that was launched in 1961.Gregory, Roy (23 October 2009). \\"The VPI Classic Turntable\\" . HiFi-Plus, Issue 68 The principle behind it is that the turntable is an inert platform that allows the stylus to track the surface of the record accurately whilst being protected from external vibrations. The platter, sub-chassis, armboard and tonearm mechanically form a closed loop, and sit on top of dampers (usually three springs) which isolate the sub-assembly from its motor and its base. The motor, mounted (directly or indirectly) on the top plate, drives the turntable platter via a belt. The compression spring system of the XA was much improved upon, and popularised in the Linn Sondek LP12. A variation can be found in the Oracle Delphi, where the spring is extended;Thompson, David (December 2013). \\"Divine Revelation\\". Record Collector News another variant is the Roksan Xerxes, whose top plate is isolated from the motor bearing assembly by compliant rubber dampers.Husband, Geoff (November 2002). \\"Roksan Xerxes X turntable and Artemiz arm\\", TNT Audio. Archived from the original on 11 July 2013. The main platter bearing may be upright or inverted, it is mounted on the sub-chassis along with the arm fixture. Bearings generally use an oil film to lubricate between a metal ball-bearing and the thrust-plate of the bearing's housing. More esoteric designs use an air bearing, where the spindle is supported by a high pressure flow of air.Holt, J. Gordon (December 1987) Versa Dynamics 2.0 LP player , Page 7, Stereophile, Vol.10 No.8 The tonearm is usually sold separately, allowing for buyer choice and upgrades. Disadvantages The main disadvantage of Belt-drive turn tables is the fact that they \\"ramp\\" to tempo; they do not instantly play the record at 33 1/3 revolutions per minute, but rather build up to this speed over the course of about one second. This creates an undesirable slurring of the record. Furthermore, over time the drive belt can wear or lose elasticity, and begin to slip, causing variations in the platter speed. In addition, belt-drive turntables have much lower torque; the belt can also slip off the motor and/or platter spindle, and are thus not suitable for turntablism. DJs who scratch or mix generally prefer to use direct-drive turntables.

Hook then became a playboy and practical joker best known for the Berners Street hoax in 1810 in which he arranged for dozens of tradesmen, and notables such as the Lord Mayor of London, the Governor of the Bank of England, the Chairman of the East India Company and the Duke of Gloucester to visit Mrs Tottenham at 54 Berners Street to win a bet that he could transform any house in London into the most talked- about address within a week.

His gift of improvising songs charmed the Prince Regent into a declaration that something must be done for Hook, who was appointed accountant-general and treasurer of Mauritius with a salary of ¬£2,000 a year. He was the life and soul of the island from his arrival in October 1813, but a serious deficiency having been discovered in the treasury accounts in 1817, he was arrested and brought to England on a criminal charge. A sum of about ¬£12,000 had been abstracted by a deputy official, and Hook was held responsible. Hook, 1810 During the scrutiny of the audit board, he lived obscurely and maintained himself by writing for magazines and newspapers. In 1820, he launched the newspaper John Bull, the champion of high Toryism and the virulent detractor of Queen Caroline. Witty criticism and pitiless invective secured it a large circulation, and Hook derived, for the first year at least, an income of ¬£2,000. He was, however, arrested for the second time on account of his debt to the state, which he made no effort to defray. While he was confined in a sponging-house from 1823 to 1825, he wrote the nine volumes of stories afterwards collected under the title of Sayings and Doings (1824‚Äì1828). In the early 1820s, he helped the singer Michael Kelly compile his Reminiscences, which include details of working with Mozart. In the remaining 23 years of his life, he poured forth 38 volumes besides articles, squibs and sketches. His novels have frequent passages of racy narrative and vivid portraiture. They include Maxwell (1830), a portrait of his friend the Reverend E. Cannon; Love and Pride (1833); the autobiographic Gilbert Gurney (1835) and Gurney Married (1838); Jack Brag (1837) and Peregrine Bunce (1842). He did not finish a biographical work on Charles Mathews. His last novel was Births, Marriages and Deaths (1839). The world's oldest postcard was sent to Hook in 1840. Bearing a penny black stamp, Hook probably created and posted the card to himself as a practical joke on the postal service since the image is a caricature of workers in the post office.Arifa Akbar, \\"Oldest picture postcard in the world snapped up for ¬£31,750\\", The Independent, 9 March 2002. In 2002, the postcard sold for a record ¬£31,750.  Later life and death  Work had already begun to tell on his health when Hook returned to his old habits and a prolonged attempt to combine industry and dissipation resulted in the confession that he was done up in purse, in mind and in body, too at last. He died at home in Fulham on 24 August 1841. His estate was seized by the Treasury. He never married but lived with Mary Anne Doughty; they had six children. Hook is remembered as one of the most brilliant figures of Georgian times. He inspired the characters of Lucian Gay in Benjamin Disraeli's novel Coningsby and Mr Wagg in Thackeray's Vanity Fair. Coleridge praised him as being \\"as true a genius as Dante\\".

Called a \\"coaching legend\\" by the Basketball Hall of Fame, he coached for 36 years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Smith coached from 1961 to 1997 and retired with 879 victories, which was the NCAA Division I men's basketball record at that time. Smith had the ninth-highest winning percentage of any men's college basketball coach (77.6%). During his tenure as head coach, North Carolina won two national championships and appeared in 11 Final Fours. Smith played college basketball at the University of Kansas, where he won a national championship in 1952 playing for Hall of fame coach Phog Allen. Smith was best known for running a clean program and having a high graduation rate, with 96.6% of his athletes receiving their degrees. While at North Carolina, Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the university's first African-American scholarship basketball player, Charlie Scott, and pushing for equal treatment for African Americans by local businesses. Smith coached and worked with numerous people at North Carolina who achieved notable success in basketball, as players, coaches, or both. Smith retired in 1997, saying that he was not able to give the team the same level of enthusiasm that he had given it for years. After retiring, Smith used his influence to help various charitable ventures and liberal political activities, but in his latter years he suffered from advanced dementia and ceased most public activities. Biography=Early years Dean Smith was born in Emporia, Kansas, on February 28, 1931. Both of his parents were public school teachers. Smith's father, Alfred, coached the Emporia High Spartans basketball team to the 1934 state title in Kansas. This 1934 team was notable for having the first African American basketball player in Kansas tournament history. While at Topeka High School, Smith lettered in basketball all four years and was named all-state in basketball as a senior. Smith's interest in sports was not limited to basketball. Smith also played quarterback for his high school football team and catcher for the high school baseball team. College years After graduating from high school, Smith attended the University of Kansas on an academic scholarship. He majored in mathematics and joined Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. While at Kansas, Smith continued his interest in sports by playing varsity basketball, varsity baseball, and freshman football. He was also a member of the Air Force ROTC detachment. During his time on the varsity basketball team, Kansas won the national championship in 1952. In 1953, the team was an NCAA tournament finalist. Smith's basketball coach during his time at Kansas was Phog Allen, who had been coached at the University of Kansas by the inventor of basketball, James Naismith. After graduation, Smith served as assistant coach at Kansas in the 1953‚Äì54 season. Coaching careerEarly years in basketball coaching= Smith next served a stint in the United States Air Force in Germany, later working as a head coach of United States Air Force Academy's baseball and golf teams. Yet, Smith's big break would come in the United States. In 1958, North Carolina coach Frank McGuire asked Smith to join his staff as an assistant coach. Smith served under McGuire for three years until 1961, when McGuire was forced to resign by Chancellor William Aycock in the wake of a major recruiting scandal, and consequently, an NCAA mandated probation. Dean Smith (right) during the 1964 UNC v. North Carolina State game. Years later, Aycock recalled that McGuire came to his office on a Saturday and told him he was resigning. Smith was waiting in McGuire's car outside South Building (UNC's main administration building), so Aycock called him in and asked him if he wanted to take over as head coach. Smith accepted, and the hiring was formally announced the following Monday.Huffman, Diane. UNC chancellor recalls bold decision to hire Dean Smith. WNCN, February 8, 2015. When Aycock named Smith as head coach, he told the 30-year-old Smith that wins and losses didn't matter as much as running a clean program and representing the university well.Chansky, Art. Blue Blood:Duke-Carolina: Inside the Most Storied Rivalry in College Hoops. New York City: St. Martin's Press, 2006. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) had canceled the Dixie Classic, an annual basketball tournament in Raleigh, North Carolina, due to a national point-shaving scandal including a North Carolina player (Lou Brown). As a result of the scandal, North Carolina de- emphasized basketball by cutting their regular-season schedule. In Smith's first season, North Carolina played only 17 games and went 8-9. This was the only losing season he endured during his career. In 1965, he was famously hanged in effigy on the university campus following a disappointing loss to Wake Forest. After that game, UNC would win nine of their last eleven games, and Smith would subsequently go on to turn the program into a consistent success. From 1965-66 onward, Smith's teams never finished worse than tied for third in the ACC. For the first 21 of those years, they did not finish worse than a tie for second. By comparison, during that time the ACC's other charter members each finished last at least once. His first major successes came in the late 1960s, when his teams won consecutive regular-season and ACC tournament championships, and went to three straight Final Fours, going all the way to the national championship game in 1968. They would appear in either the NCAA or NIT in every one of Smith's final 31 years in Chapel Hill. However, this run occurred in the middle of UCLA's stretch of 10 titles in 12 years, and in fact Smith lost to UCLA's John Wooden in the 1968 title game. First national championship Michael Jordan and Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 2007 game honoring the 1957 and 1982 men's basketball teams. Smith's first national championship occurred with his 1981‚Äì82 team, which was composed of future NBA players such as Michael Jordan, James Worthy and Sam Perkins. After winning the NCAA Tournament, North Carolina had a record of 32-2.Tarheel Monthly A Magical Season - Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the 1982 NCAA Champs . Published March 2002. Retrieved on August 13, 2007. The other teams that advanced with North Carolina were Georgetown, Houston and Louisville. The Tar Heels actually finished in a tie for first in the ACC regular season with the Ralph Sampson-led Virginia Cavaliers. In the semifinals, North Carolina defeated Houston 68-63 in New Orleans, while Georgetown defeated Louisville 50-46. The national title game against Georgetown was evenly matched throughout. However, with 17 seconds left on the clock, and the Tar Heels behind by 1 point, Jordan made what ended up being the game-winning shot to put the Tar Heels up 63-62. On Georgetown's ensuing possession, Hoya guard Fred Brown inexplicably passed the ball directly to Worthy with no Georgetown player anywhere near the pass. Worthy attempted to dribble out the clock, but was fouled with 2 seconds left. He missed both free throws, but Georgetown had no timeouts left. The Hoyas missed a halfcourt shot as time expired, giving Smith his first national championship in his seventh appearance in the Final Four. Second national championship Dean Smith's 1992‚Äì93 squad featured George Lynch, Eric Montross, Brian Reese, Donald Williams, and Derrick Phelps. The Tar Heels started out with an 8-0 record and were ranked #5 in the country when they met #6 Michigan in the semi-finals of the Rainbow Classic. The Wolverines, led by the Fab Five in their sophomore season, won 79-78 on a last-second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back-to-back road games against unranked Wake Forest and #5 Duke. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 heading into the last week of the regular season (their first #1 ranking since the start of the 1987‚Äì88 season). North Carolina beat #14 Wake Forest and #6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top seed in the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77-75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps, who was injured. Nonetheless, North Carolina was awarded the top seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament, defeating #16-seed East Carolina (85-65), #8-seed Rhode Island (112-67), #4-seed Arkansas (80-74) and #2-seed Cincinnati (75-68) to reach the Final Four in New Orleans. In the National Semifinals, Smith's Tar Heels defeated his alma mater Kansas (coached by future North Carolina coach Roy Williams) 78-68. In 1991, the same two teams also met in the National Semifinals with Kansas prevailing and Dean Smith being ejected. The 1993 victory for UNC set up a rematch from earlier that season with #3-ranked Michigan in the Finals. The 1993 national title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber calling a time-out while trapped against the sideline by two defenders. Michigan didn't have any timeouts remaining and trailed by two points. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77-71, giving Smith his second national championship. After a six-year investigation by the NCAA, Webber's association and financial dealings with Ed Martin determined that there had been a series of violations and direct payments to players and was termed \\"the University of Michigan basketball scandal\\" and resulted in Michigan pulling down all of its banners and titles from that era. =Retirement= Smith announced his retirement on October 9, 1997. He had said that if he ever felt he could not give his team the same enthusiasm he had given it for years, he would retire. His announcement was unexpected, as he had given little warning that he was considering retirement. Bill Guthridge, his assistant for 30 years, succeeded him as head coach. During his retirement, Smith had a large influence on the North Carolina basketball program. In 2003 Smith talked to Roy Williams regarding his decision about whether or not to replace a struggling Matt Doherty as head coach. Williams had previously declined the head coaching position three years earlier when Guthridge retired. In July 2010, John Feinstein disclosed that he had planned to write a biography of Smith, but had to shelve it due to Smith's deteriorating memory. Shortly after, Smith's family released a letter on July 17, 2010, stating that he had a \\"progressive neurocognitive disorder\\", which has not been publicly disclosed as Alzheimer's or anything else. He had trouble remembering the names of some of his players, the letter said, but he could not forget what his relationships with those players meant. He also remembered words to hymns and jazz standards, but did not go to concerts. He had difficulty with traveling but continued to watch his former team on TV. Williams said, \\"He does have his good days and bad.\\" =Coaching profile= Smith-coached teams varied in style, depending on the players Smith had available. But they generally featured a fast-break style, a half-court offense that emphasized the passing game, and an aggressive trapping defense that produced turnovers and easy baskets. From 1970 until his retirement, his teams featured an impressive shooting percentage of over 50% in all but four years. Smith was credited with creating or popularizing the following basketball techniques: The \\"tired signal,\\" in which a player would use a hand signal (originally a raised fist) to indicate that he needed to come out for a rest, huddling at the free throw line before a foul shot, encouraging players who scored a basket to point a finger at the teammate who passed them the ball, in honor of the passer's selflessness, instituting a variety of defensive sets in one game, having the point guard call out the defense set for the team, and creating a number of defensive sets, including the point zone, the run-and-jump, and double-teaming the screen-and-roll. Smith at a North Carolina game in 2007 But strategically, Smith was most associated with his implementation of John McLendon's four corners offense, a strategy for stalling with a lead near the end of the game. Smith's teams executed the four corners set so effectively that in 1985 the NCAA instituted a shot clock to speed up play and minimize ball-control offense. Although fellow Kansas alum John McLendon actually invented the four corners offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of Basketball: Multiple Offense and Defense, which is the best-selling technical basketball book in history. Smith also instituted the practice of starting all his team's seniors on the last home game of the season (\\"Senior Day\\") as a way of honoring the contributions of the subs as well as the stars. In a season when the team included six seniors, he put all six on the floor at the beginning of the game ‚Äì drawing a technical foul ‚Äì rather than leave one of them out. During the 1993 run for the national title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him at a conference in Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers. Student athletes under Smith achieved a graduation rate of 96.6% at North Carolina, and he established a reputation for running a clean program. Although athletes allegedly benefited from academic improprieties at the university during Smith's reign, there is no evidence that Smith was aware of the practice. Personal life Dean Smith married Ann Cleavinger in 1954, shortly before his deployment overseas with the United States Air Force. They had three children: daughters Sharon and Sandy, and son Scott. Smith and Cleavinger divorced in 1973. Smith married psychiatrist Dr. Linnea Weblemoe Smith on May 21, 1976. They have two adult daughters, Kristen and Kelly.Smith, Dean (2002). A Coach's Life.

A private funeral was held on February 12 at Binkley Baptist Church in Chapel Hill, with burial following at Old Chapel Hill Cemetery on the UNC campus. A public memorial service was held at the Dean Smith Center on February 22. He willed a $200 check to each of the former lettermen he coached during his 36 years at North Carolina, which included the message \\"Enjoy a dinner out compliments of Coach Dean Smith.‚Äù The trustee told ESPN that checks were sent out to about 180 ex-players.

The others are Pete Newell and Bob Knight. * At the time of his retirement, Smith was one of only two people, along with Bob Knight, who had played on and coached a winning NCAA championship basketball team. Recognition Smith received a number of personal honors during his coaching career. He was named the National Coach of the Year four times (1977, 1979, 1982, 1993) and ACC Coach of the Year eight times (1967, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1976, 1977, 1979, 1988, 1993). Smith was also inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on May 2, 1983, two years after being enshrined in the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame. Smith was the first recipient of the Mentor Award for Lifetime Achievement, given by the University of North Carolina Committee on Teaching Awards for \\"a broader range of teaching beyond the classroom.\\" He has also been awarded honorary doctorates by Eastern University and Catawba College. In 1982, Smith was the recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. The basketball arena at North Carolina, the Dean Smith Center, was named for Smith. It is also widely referred to as the \\"Dean Dome\\". Smith coached the last 11.5 years of his career in the arena, making him one of the few college coaches to have coached in an arena or stadium named for him. In 1997, upon his retirement, Smith was named Sportsman of the Year by the magazine Sports Illustrated. ESPN named Smith one of the five all-time greatest American coaches of any sport. In 1998, he won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, presented at the annual ESPY Awards hosted by ESPN. On November 17, 2006, Smith was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five, along with Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, John Wooden and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class. In 2007, he was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame. On November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama awarded Smith the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Political activities Dean Smith was one of the most prominent Democrats in North Carolina politics. Politically, he was best known for promoting desegregation. In 1964, Smith joined a local pastor and a black North Carolina theology student to integrate The Pines, a Chapel Hill restaurant. He also integrated the Tar Heels basketball team by recruiting Charlie Scott as the university's first black scholarship athlete. In 1965, Smith helped Howard Lee, a black graduate student at North Carolina, purchase a home in an all-white neighborhood. He opposed the Vietnam War and, in the early 1980s, famously recorded radio spots to promote a freeze on nuclear weapons. He has been a prominent opponent of the death penalty. In 1998, he appeared at a clemency hearing for a death-row inmate and pointed at then-Governor Jim Hunt: \\"You're a murderer. And I'm a murderer. The death penalty makes us all murderers.\\" As head coach, he periodically held North Carolina basketball practices in North Carolina prisons. While coach, he was recruited by some in the Democratic Party to run for the United States Senate against incumbent Jesse Helms. He declined. But in retirement, he continued to speak out on issues such as the war in Iraq, death penalty and gay rights. Although a staunch Democrat, Smith did support one of his former players, Richard Vinroot, a Republican who ran for governor of North Carolina in 2000. In 2006, Smith became the spokesperson for Devout Democrats, an inter-faith, grassroots political action committee designed to convince religious Americans to vote for Democrats. Smith was featured in an ad that ran in newspapers across North Carolina and was featured in an Associated Press article. On October 13, 2008, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama's candidacy for President of the United States.

John Liston (c. 1776 - 22 March 1846), English comedian, was born in London. He made his public debut on the stage at Weymouth as Lord Duberley in The Heir at Law. After several dismal failures in tragic parts, some of them in support of Mrs Siddons, he discovered accidentally that his forte was comedy, especially in the personation of old men and country boys, in which he displayed a fund of drollery and broad humour. An introduction to Charles Kemble led to his appearance at the Haymarket on 10 June 1805 as Sheepface in the Village Lawyer, and his association with this theatre continued with few interruptions until 1830. Paul Pry, 1825. Paul Pry, the most famous of all his impersonations, was first presented on 13 September 1825 and soon became, thanks to his creative genius, a real personage. Liston remained on the stage till 1837; during his last years his mind failed, and he died on 22 March 1846. He had married in 1807 Miss Tyrer (d. 1854), a singer and actress. In the January 1825 of the London Magazine there appeared a Memoir of John Liston written by his close friend Charles Lamb. This was said by Lamb to be \\"pure invention\\"Prance page 203 and intended as a humorous essay. Liston himself replied to this Memoir in the following edition of the London Magazine suggesting that the same writer pen a short life of Byron. Several pictures of Liston in character are in the Garrick Club, London, and as Paul Pry in the South Kensington Museum and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland archives.

He was a Liberal Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2008, representing Waterloo and the successor riding of Kitchener‚ÄîWaterloo.  Early life and career  Telegdi was born in Budapest, Hungary. He emigrated to Canada with his family in 1957 as a refugee following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. He attended the University of Waterloo in the 1970s. He served two terms as president of the Federation of Students, UW's student union, from 1973-1974. After graduating, he became executive director of Youth in Conflict with the Law, and was a board member of the Working Centre (St. John's Soup Kitchen). Telegdi was also appointed to the board of governors of Wilfrid Laurier University. Telegdi was a city councillor for Waterloo City Council from 1985 to 1993. In this office he also sat as a city representative as a regional councillor for the RM of Waterloo.  Career in federal politics  As member of the Ontario Liberal Party he ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the riding of Waterloo North in the 1990 provincial election. He finished a poor third against Progressive Conservative Elizabeth Witmer thus becoming the first Liberal to lose that riding in over 23 years. He won an easy victory to the House of Commons of Canada three years later and was subsequently re- elected four times, all by comfortable margins. Telegdi was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister and Citizenship of Immigration on July 16, 1998, but resigned the position on May 18, 2000, as he objected to certain provisions in the government's proposed Citizenship Act. He was concerned with a clause that gave Canada's parliament, rather than the courts, the right to remove a person's citizenship, and in particular Helmut Oberlander's who was a constituent of the riding he then represented. Commenting on this issue, he said \\"For me, my citizenship comes before my party.\\" During this controversy, Telegdi argued that placing parliament above the courts on citizenship issues was similar to \\"what Hitler used to do\\". Telegdi was widely criticized for this comment and the Canadian Jewish Congress and called for Telegdi's removal from the Liberal caucus. In response, Telegdi noted that his stepfather was a Jewish refugee from Romania, and claimed his comments had been reported out of context in a sensational manner. He also issued the following statement: \\"What I have said is that a liberal democratic state such as Canada should never remove citizenship lightly. That is what Hitler did to Jews, Gypsies and many others. That is what Stalin did to millions. All totalitarian regimes have engaged in these practices.\\" He also issued an apology for his comments to the House of Commons. Telegdi also engaged in a public dispute with Liberal Party activist Warren Kinsella during this period. After Kinsella criticized Telegdi's comments on the Citizenship Act, Telegdi wrote a letter calling on Kinsella to resign as Jean Chr√©tien's spokesperson.Brian Laghi, \\"MP targets Chr√©tien spokesman\\", Globe and Mail, 21 June 2002, A4. Telegdi is a liberal on most social issues. He is a strong supporter of gay rights and same-sex marriage. He also opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, expressing concern that the American approach of \\"pre-emptive strikes\\" would create new problems and undermine multilateral institutions.Anthony Reinhart, \\"Area MPs defend tough love stance toward U.S. neighbours\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 20 March 2003, A5. For several years, Telegdi was a supporter of Paul Martin in his bid to succeed Jean Chr√©tien as leader of the Liberal Party. Soon after Martin succeeded Chr√©tien as Liberal leader and Prime Minister, Telegdi was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister with special emphasis on Aboriginal Affairs. He held this position until just after the 2004 election and prior to the 2008 election was vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. He lost to Conservative candidate Peter Braid by an initial count of 48 votes in the 2008 federal election. A judicial recount was ordered, as the margin of victory was less than 0.1%. The final validated count, showing errors in two polls, confirmed his opponent had won the seat by 17 votes, the smallest margin of victory in the 2008 federal election. He campaigned again in the 2011 federal election and lost to Braid by 2,114 votes. Post-federal career In 2014, Telegdi ran and lost in the 2014 Waterloo Regional Elections. He came in third place to become one of two councillors for Waterloo on the Waterloo Regional Council.

He wrote three symphonies, four piano concertos, two violin concertos, two cello concertos, operas, operettas, ballets, chamber music, incidental music and film music. During the 1930s, Khrennikov was already being hailed as a leading official Soviet composer. In 1948, Andrei Zhdanov, the leader of the anti-formalism campaign, nominated Khrennikov as Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers. He held this influential post until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Biography =Early years Tikhon Khrennikov was the youngest of ten children, born into a family of horse traders in the town of Yelets, Oryol Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Lipetsk Oblast in central Russia). He learned guitar and mandolin from members of his family and sang in a local choir in Yelets. There he also played in a local orchestra and learned the piano. As a teenager he moved to Moscow. From 1929 to 1932, he studied composition at the Gnessin State Musical College under Mikhail Gnessin and Yefraim Gelman. From 1932 to 1936, he attended the Moscow Conservatory. There he studied composition under Vissarion Shebalin and piano under Heinrich Neuhaus. As a student, he wrote and played his Piano Concerto No. 1, and his graduation piece was the Symphony No. 1. His first symphony was conducted by Leopold Stokowski.The Economist obituary 1 September 2007 p. 73 He became popular with the series of songs and serenades that he composed for the 1936 production of Much Ado About Nothing at the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow. By the 1930s, Khrennikov was already treated as a leading official Soviet composer. Typical was his speech during a discussion in February 1936 concerning Pravda articles \\"Chaos instead of music\\" and \\"Ballet falseness\\": > The resolution on 23rd April 1932 appealed to the consciousness of the > Soviet artist. Soviet artists had not withstood scrutiny. After 23rd April, > youth was inspired to study. The problem was, we had to master the skills > and techniques of composition. We developed an enthusiasm for modern western > composers. The names of Hindemith and Krenek came to be symbols of advanced > modern artists. [...] After the enthusiasm for western tendencies came an > attraction to simplicity, influenced by composing for the theatre, where > simple, expressive music was required. We grew, our consciousness also grew, > as well as the aspiration to be genuine Soviet composers, representatives of > our epoch. Compositions by Hindemith satisfied us no more. Soon after that > Prokofiev arrived, declaring Soviet music to be provincial and naming > Shostakovich as the most up-to-date composer. Young composers were confused: > on the one hand, they wanted to create simpler music that would be easier > for the masses to understand; on the other hand, they were confronted with > the statements of such musical authorities as Prokofiev. Critics wrote > laudatory odes to Shostakovich. [‚Ä¶] How did young composers react to Lady > Macbeth [of Mtsensk]? This opera contains several large melodic fragments > which opened some creative perspectives to us. But the entre‚Äòactes and other > things aroused complete hostility.Vystuplenie tov.

In 1941, Khrennikov was appointed Music Director of the Central Theatre of the Red Army, a position he would keep for 25 years. In February 1945 Khrennikov was officially posted by the Political Authority (Politupravlenie) of the Red Army from Sverdlovsk, where he and his family had been evacuated, to the First Belorussian Front, and the Army commanded by General (later Marshal) Chuikov.Valentina Rubtsova (Ed.).

Solomon Volkov's controversial Shostakovich memoir Testimony claims that Khrennikov was so intimidated at a meeting with Stalin that the composer soiled his pants and suffered a nervous breakdown. For a long time it was held that, thanks to Khrennikov's efforts, no Soviet composers were arrested or prosecuted.Solomon Volkov. Die Memoiren des Dmitri Schostakowitsch. Berlin/M√ºnchen 2000, p. 205. (Published in English as Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich - several editions) In an interview with pianist on 8 November 2004 in Moscow, Khrennikov asserted that composer Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg, when arrested, had been discharged immediately because of Khrennikov's protection; according to Khrennikov the same had happened to Alexander Veprik. The facts are that Veprik spent four years in a prison camp and Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg, who was released in June 1953, had been saved from prosecution, and probably from execution, only because of Stalin's death.Jascha Nemtsov. Ich bin schon l√§ngst tot\\" - Komponisten im Gulag: Vsevolod Zaderackij und Alexander Veprik'. Osteuropa 6/2007, pp. 315-340 In recent years, information that had been suppressed since 1948 began to be published, and documents and facts now known confirm that there were extensive prosecutions. In 1949 Khrennikov officially attacked the young composer Alexander Lokshin, using formulations of one of Stalin's most notorious ideologists, Paul Apostolov. In his speech Khrennikov contrasted Lokshin's \\"modernist\\" style with the bylina Stepan Razin's Dream by Galina Ustvolskaya, which he considered an ideal example of true national art.Tikhon Khrennikov: \\"Za noviy podem sovetskoy muziki\\" (\\"For the new rise of Soviet music\\"). Sovetskaya muzika, 1949, ‚Ññ 12, p. 51; see also: A. A. Lokshin: Geniy zla (The Genius of Evil). 3rd, revised and expanded ed. Moscow, 2003, p. 93-94 Khrennikov's speech aroused great indignation in Mikhail Gnessin, who accused him of duplicity: not daring to criticise Lokshin in a professional environment, Khrennikov attacked him ideologically from his position as a leading Soviet official.Marina Lobanova: \\"√Ñsthet, Protestler, Regimeopfer: Das Schicksal Alexander Lokschins im politisch-kulturellen Kontext der Sowjetzeit\\", in: M. Lobanova, E. Kuhn (eds.): Ein unbekanntes Genie: Der Symphoniker Alexander Lokschin. Monographien - Zeugnisse - Dokumente - W√ºrdigungen. Berlin 2002, p. 32 After this ideological campaign Lokshin was excluded from academic circles. Khrennikov did not prevent Prokofiev's first wife, Lina Ivanovna, being charged as a \\"spy\\" following her arrest by the NKVD on 20 February 1948. As head of the Composers' Union, Khrennikov made no attempt to have the sentence against Lina Prokofieva quashed, or even to mitigate her fate in the Gulag. The Composers' Union did not help Prokofiev's sons, who were compulsorily evicted from their apartment. After Lina Ivanovna Prokofieva returned from Gulag, the Composers' Union did nothing to improve the extremely bad living conditions of her family; it was the prominent singers Irina Arkhipova and Zurab Sotkilava who protected Prokofiev's first family. Afterwards, the family was exposed to regular official humiliations. According to Prokofiev's first son, Sviatoslav, the Composers' Union officially refused Lina Prokofieva permission to go to Paris, after she had been personally invited by the French culture minister to the opening of Prokofiev's memorial board. Instead, Khrennikov took part at that ceremony with his whole family. The Composers' Union also refused Lina Prokofieva permission to go to the opening of the Sydney Opera House. At the same time, Sviatoslav Prokofiev noted the typical logic of the Soviet functionary: sometimes Khrennikov could help if it was not dangerous for his own position and career.Valentina Chemberdzhi. Dvadtsaty vek Lini Prokof‚Äôevoy (Lina Prokofieva‚Äòs twentieth century). Moscow, 2008, pp. 250, 259-260, 263-264 The ideological campaigns of 1948-49 against \\"formalists\\" in music were directly connected with the offensive against the so-called rootless cosmopolitans, which formed a part of the state anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union that flourished after the Second World War in various forms: ideological resolutions, declarations by official writers and critics, offensive caricatures and vulgar anti-Semitic abuse in the satirical magazine Krokodil (Crocodile). Historians of state anti-Semitism in the USSR name Khrennikov among the most active fighters for \\"purity of Russian culture\\". In Soviet official policy both before and after Stalin's death, a clear distinction was drawn between \\"good Soviet Jews\\" and \\"Nazis-Zionists\\".Benjamin Pinkus. The Soviet Government and the Jews 1948-1967: A documented study. Cambridge University Press, 1984. pp. 101, 112-113, 158-159, 491, 510. True to this party line, the leadership of the Soviet Composers‚Äò Union branded composers as \\"zionist aggressors\\" or \\"agents of world imperialism\\", and made accusations of \\"ideologically vicious\\" and \\"hostile\\" phenomena in Soviet musical culture. An accusation of Zionism was often used as a weapon against people of different nationalities, faiths and opinions, such as Nikolai Roslavets. \\"Struggle against formalists\\" was pursued in other countries too: according to Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, after Khrennikov's official visit to Budapest in 1948, The Miraculous Mandarin by B√©la Bart√≥k was removed from the repertoire and paintings by French impressionists and others were removed from display in museums. In 1952 Ligeti was almost forbidden to teach after he had shown the score of the proscribed Symphony of Psalms by Igor Stravinsky to his students; Ligeti was saved only because of the personal protection of Zolt√°n Kod√°ly.\\"Ich sehe keinen Widerspruch zwischen Tradition und Modernit√§t!\\". \\"Gy√∂rgy Ligeti im Gespr√§ch mit Marina Lobanova\\": Das Orchester 12/1996, pp. 10-11. Khrennikov and other functionaries of the Composers‚Äò Union constantly attacked the heritage of the Russian avant-garde as well as its researchers.M. Lobanova: '\\"Er wurde von der Zeit erw√§hlt\\": Das Ph√§nomen Tichon Chrennikow'. In \\"Schostakowitsch in Deutschland\\" (= Schostakowitsch-Studien, Band. 1). Published by H. Schmalenberg (Studia slavica musicologica, Vol. 13). Berlin 1998, pp. 117-139. For example, the German musicologist Detlef Gojowy (1934‚Äì2008) was persecuted because of his promotion in the West of modern Soviet music of the 1920s. Gojowy was proclaimed to be an \\"anti-Soviet writer\\" - till 1989 he was forbidden to visit the Soviet Union and some of his publications that he sent to Soviet colleagues were intercepted by Soviet customs. At the same time, Soviet musicologists engaged in developing a Russian avant-garde tradition were officially prohibited from going abroad. Once again, Nicolai Roslavets was an example. Khrennikov was a Member of Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from the 1950s on. From 1962, he was a representative in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Later years In his last years, Khrennikov made extremely negative statements about Perestroika, its leaders, the fall of the Soviet Union and the liquidation of corresponding structures: > It was a betrayal by our leaders. I consider Gorbachev and his henchmen, who > deliberately organised persecution of Soviet art, to be traitors to the > party and the people [...]\\".Tikhon Khrennikov: \\"Ya chist pered muzikoy i > narodom ...\\" (\\"I am innocent towards music and the people ...\\"). Zavtra, ‚Ññ > 41 (254), 13 October 1998. In another interview given to the same newspaper Zavtra (meaning \\"Tomorrow\\") he described Stalin as a \\"genius\\", an \\"absolutely normal person\\", tolerant of criticism: > Stalin, in my opinion, knew music better than any of us. [‚Ä¶] As in classical > Ancient Greece, so too in the Soviet Union music was of the greatest > importance to the state. The spiritual influence of the greatest composers > and artists in the formation of intelligent and strong-willed people, first > of all through radio, was huge.Tikhon Khrennikov: \\"Stalin znal muziku > luchshe nas ...\\" (\\"Stalin knew music better than we ...\\"). Zavtra, ‚Ññ 39 > (671), 27th September 2006. Khrennikov's memoirs were published in 1994 after the fall of the Soviet Union. He died in Moscow aged 94 and is buried near his parents' tomb in his native town of Yelets.

Its home port is La Spezia, Italy, and it is in use as a school ship. History In 1925, the Regia Marina ordered two school ships to a design by General Lieutenant Francesco Rotundi of the Italian Navy Engineering Corps, inspired by the style of large late 18th century 74-cannon ships of the line (like the neapolitan ship \\"Monarca\\"). The first, the Cristoforo Colombo, was put into service in 1928 and was used by the Italian Navy until 1943. After World War II, this ship was handed over to the USSR as part of the war reparations and was shortly afterwards decommissioned. The second ship was the Amerigo Vespucci, built in 1930 at the (formerly Royal) Naval Shipyard of Castellammare di Stabia (Naples). She was launched on February 22, 1931, and put into service in July of that year. The vessel is a full rigged three- masted steel hull long, with an overall length of including the bowsprit and a maximum width of . She has a draught of about and a displacement at full load of 4146 tons. Under auxiliary diesel-electric propulsion the Amerigo Vespucci can reach and has a range of 5450 nm at 6.5 knots. Oslo, 2005. Akershus Fortress in the background. bireme Ivlia. Portoferraio island Elba, 1991. The three steel masts are 50, 54 and 43 metres high, and carry sails totalling . The Amerigo Vespucci has 26 sails ‚Äì square sails, staysails, and jibs: all are traditional canvas sails. When under sail in severe sea and wind conditions she can reach . The rig, some 30 km of ropes, uses only traditional hemp ropes; only the mooring lines are synthetic, to comply with port regulations. The hull is painted black with two white stripes, harking back to the two gun decks of the ships her design is based on, but she carries only two 6pdr saluting guns in pivot mountings on the deck, forward of the mainmast. The deck planks are of teak wood and must be replaced every three years. Bow and stern are decorated with intricate ornaments; she has a life- size figurehead of Amerigo Vespucci. The stern gallery is accessible only through the Captain's saloon. The standard crew of the Amerigo Vespucci is 16 officers, 70 non-commissioned officers and 190 sailors. In summer, when she embarks the midshipmen of the Naval Academy (Accademia Navale), the crew totals some 450. In 1964 the ship was fitted with two 4-stroke, 8-cylinder FIAT B 308 ESS diesel engines, which replaced the original 2-stroke 6-cylinder FIAT Q 426 engines. These engines generated electric power for one electric propulsion motor that produced up to about . After update works, between 2013 and 2016, the ship has been fitted with two 4-stroke, 12-cylinder MTU, 1,32 MW each diesel engine generators and two 4-stroke, 8-cylinder MTU, 760 kW each diesel engine generators, and one NIDEC (Ansaldo Sistemi Industriali) electric engine.http://www.nidec- asi.com/_modules/download/download/en/Amerigo_Vespucci.pdf During the same work, the ship has been fitted with new radar GEM Elettronica AN/SPS-753(V)5, new satellite antenna ORBIT AL-7103. When carrying cadets, the ship is usually steered from the manual stern rudder station, which is operated by four steering wheels with two men each. At other times, the hydraulically assisted steering on the bridge is used. Except for the anchor winch, the winches aboard are not power operated. The bridge is equipped with sophisticated modern electronic navigation instruments. Other than during World War II, the Amerigo Vespucci has been continually active. Most of her training cruises are in European waters, but she has also sailed to North and South America, and navigated the Pacific. In 2002, she undertook a voyage around the world. The Amerigo Vespucci often takes part in sailing parades and Tall Ships' Races, where she is in amicable rivalry with the Gorch Fock. When she is berthed in port, public tours of the vessel are usually offered. On 7 July 2018, Amerigo Vespucci arrived to the port of Almeria. It is the third time it visited Almer√≠a: the first one was in 1932, and the second one was in 1989. It left the city on 10 July. Then it will travel to Ponta Delgada, in the Azores Islands, and it will cross the Atlantic Ocean to the Northern Europe.

He won the Copley Medal in 1777 for a paper on reflecting telescopes. Life He was the fourth and youngest son of the Rev. Zachariah Mudge, by his first wife, Mary Fox, and was born at Bideford, Devon. He was educated at Bideford and Plympton grammar schools, and studied medicine at Plymouth Hospital. Several invitations were made to Mudge to try his fortunes in London. But he preferred to remain at Plymouth, where he practised for the remainder of his life, first as surgeon, and, after 1784, when he received the degree of M.D. from King's College, Aberdeen, as a physician. Mudge inherited a friendship with the family of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and when in 1762 Samuel Johnson accompanied Reynolds on his visit to Plymouth, Johnson became a friend and consulted Mudge as a physician. Another intimate friend was John Smeaton. Other allies and guests of Mudge were James Ferguson, the astronomer, and James Northcote, originally a chemist's assistant, who owed him his position in Reynolds's studio. Telescopes On 29 May 1777 Mudge was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in the same year was awarded the Copley medal for his ‚ÄòDirections for making the best Composition for the Metals for reflecting Telescopes; together with a Description of the Process for Grinding, Polishing, and giving the great Speculum the true Parabolic Curve,‚Äô which were communicated by the author to the society, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions (1777, lxvii. 296). The ‚ÄòDirections‚Äô were also issued separately by Bowyer (London, 1778). Sir John Pringle, the president, in making the presentation, remarked that Isaac Newton had predicted the role of mechanical devices in making parabolic mirrors. The manufacture of telescopes continued to occupy much of his spare time. He made two large ones with a magnifying power of two hundred times; one of these he gave to Hans Moritz von Br√ºhl, and it passed to the Gotha Observatory, the other descended to his son William Mudge. Medical works John Mudge in the 1790s In 1777 he published a work on smallpoxDissertation on the Inoculated Small Pox, or an Attempt towards an Investigation of the real Causes which render the Small Pox by Inoculation so much more mild and safe then the same Disease when produced by the ordinary means of Infection. representing an advance on the previous treatises by Richard Mead and others. In 1778 he published ‚ÄòA Radical and Expeditious Cure for recent Catarrhous Cough,‚Äô with a drawing of a remedial inhaler, which obtained wide acceptance. He wrote some further small medical treatises. Family Mudge was married three times, and had ten children. By Mary Bulteel, his first wife, he had eight children. His second wife, Jane, was buried on 3 February 1766 in St. Andrew's. He married thirdly, 29 May 1767, Elizabeth Garrett, who survived him, dying in 1808, aged 72. His sons included William Mudge and Zachary Mudge, by his second and third wives respectively.

The Canadian social credit movement was largely an out-growth of the Alberta Social Credit Party. The Social Credit Party of Canada was strongest in Alberta, before developing a base in Quebec when R√©al Caouette agreed to merge his Ralliement cr√©ditiste movement into the federal party. The British Columbia Social Credit Party formed the government for many years in neighbouring British Columbia, although this was effectively a coalition of centre-right forces in the province that had no interest in social credit monetary policies. The Alberta Social Credit party won a majority government in 1935, in the first election it contested, barely months after its formation. During its first years, when led by William Aberhart, it was a radical monetary reform party, at least in theory if not in effect. After Aberhart's death in 1943 and the rise to leadership of Ernest Manning, followed quickly by the discovery of oil in north-central Alberta and its accompanying wealth for many, Social Credit took on a more conservative hue. Its policies were pro-business and anti-union, and largely opposed to government intervention in the economy. It stayed in power until 1971, one of the longest unbroken runs in government at the provincial level in Canada. However, it held no seats after 1982, and finished a distant seventh in the 2012 and 2015 general elections, before the party's name change. In May 2017, the party changed its name to the Pro-Life Alberta Political Association following the election of anti-abortion activist Jeremy Fraser as leader. History=Origins William Aberhart, a Baptist lay-preacher and evangelist in Calgary, was attracted to social credit theory while Alberta (and much of the western world) was in the depths of the Great Depression. He soon began promoting it through his radio program on CFCN in Calgary, adding a heavy dose of fundamentalist Christianity to the Social Credit theories of C.H. Douglas. The basic premise of social credit is that all citizens should be paid a dividend as capital and technology replace labour in production; this was especially attractive to farmers sinking under the weight of the Depression. Many study groups devoted to the theory sprang up across the province, which united into the Social Credit League of Alberta. Rise to power From 1932 to 1935, Aberhart tried to get the governing United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) to adopt social credit. However, the 1935 UFA convention voted against adopting social credit and UFA Premier Richard Reid rejected the proposals as being outside the province's constitutional powers, so Aberhart entered Social Credit candidates in that year's provincial election. There was widespread discontent with the overly cautious behaviour of the UFA government, and in some cases, local UFA chapters openly supported Social Credit candidates. The UFA government was also reeling from a scandal that had forced Reid's predecessor, John Brownlee, to resign a year earlier. This, in particular, caused some socially conservative UFA members to transfer their allegiance to the Christian-based Social Credit movement. In the August 22, 1935, election, much to its own surprise, Social Credit won a landslide victory, taking 54% of the vote and winning 56 of the 63 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The only elected opposition was five Liberals and two Conservatives. The UFA lost all of its seats in the worst defeat for a sitting provincial government in Canadian history. Alberta thus elected the first Social Credit government in the world. Not even the Socreds had expected to win the election. Indeed, they hadn't even named a leader during the campaign. The Socreds now found themselves having to choose a formal leader who would become the province's new premier. Aberhart was the obvious choice, having been the party's driving force from the beginning. He didn't want the office, but was persuaded to take power. He was elected as leader and premier- designate at the party's first caucus meeting, and was sworn in on September 3. He became a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) a year later in a by- election. The first year and a half in power was a period of adjustment for the newly elected Socred MLAs and their premier. Negotiations between Aberhart and Douglas, who had been hired by the UFA as a financial advisor, were colourful but unproductive. Aberhart, consumed with details of governance and administration, made little progress along the social credit monetary reform road. After election he hired an orthodox financial expert named Magor, much to Douglas's displeasure, thus forestalling radical monetary reform. In March 1937 many Socred MLAs revolted against Aberhart's leadership, refusing to pass the provincial budget until Aberhart promised serious reform of the banking system.Johnson, L.P.V. and Ola MacNutt, Aberhart of Alberta, p. 100-149 =Not \\"funny money\\"= Following the 1937 revolt, the government made a serious attempt to implement social credit policies. It passed several pieces of radical populist legislation, such as the issuance of prosperity certificates to Alberta residents (dubbed \\"funny money\\" by detractors) in accordance with the theories of Silvio Gesell. Douglas, the main leader of the Social Credit movement, did not like the idea of prosperity certificates, which depreciated in value the longer they were held, and openly criticized Gesell's theories. The Socreds also passed bills that would have placed the province's banks under government control. However, Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen refused to grant Royal Assent to the bills. The Supreme Court of Canada sided with Bowen and struck down the bills because only the federal government can legislate on banking. Thwarted in its attempt to gain control of Alberta's private banks, Aberhart's government gained a foothold in the province's financial sector by creating the Alberta Treasury Branches (ATB) in 1938. ATB has become a lasting legacy of Social Credit Party policies in Alberta, operating as an orthodox financial institution and crown corporation. It is today the only government-owned financial institution in Canada that provides commercial banking to the public. Bowen also refused Royal Assent to the government's Accurate News and Information Act, which would have forced newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the Executive Council (cabinet) objected. The government's relationship with Bowen became so acrimonious that in 1938, Bowen threatened to use his reserve power to dismiss Aberhart. In the end, Bowen chose not to take this extraordinary action. Had Bowen sacked Aberhart, it would have triggered a new election, and the Socreds were so popular that they would have almost certainly been re-elected. =Other policies= To uphold its election promise of democratizing Alberta's government, Aberhart passed a law allowing for the recall of members of the Legislative Assembly by petition of constituents. However, he repealed the legislation when he himself became the target of a recall drive. Continuing the UFA government's conservatism (which verged on prohibition) on the matter of drinking, Aberhart's government enacted several socially conservative laws, notably one restricting the sale and serving of alcohol. It was one of the strictest such laws in Canada. Well into the 1960s, commercial airlines could not serve alcohol while flying over Alberta. As well, the government passed stronger labour legislation, such as a minimum wage law for male workers (female workers already coming under legislation passed by the UFA government), and centralized the province's school system. Manning era Social Credit was elected with a slightly reduced mandate in 1940. \\"Bible Bill\\" Aberhart died in 1943 and was replaced by his Provincial Secretary and Minister of Trade and Industry, Ernest Manning. Manning's government was much more pragmatic. Under his leadership, the party largely abandoned social credit monetary theories, though it did issue prosperity certificates from oil royalties in 1957 and 1958.Donn Downey, \\"OBITUARY / Ernest Charles Manning History of former Alberta premier also history of Socreds,\\" Globe and Mail, February 20, 1996 His government was one of the most conservative provincial governments in Canada. Manning moved to purge anti- Semites from the party. While anti-Semitism had been part of the party's Christian populist rhetoric for years, it had become far less fashionable after World War II. Several socially conservative laws remained in place for years, such as the ban on airlines serving alcohol over provincial airspace. Due in part to what was seen as its good government of the province, Manning led Social Credit to seven consecutive election victories. He governed with very large majorities for virtually his entire tenure, winning well over 50 percent of the popular vote and rarely facing more than ten opposition MLAs. For most of the next two decades, Alberta was virtually a one-party state. He wielded considerable influence over the party's federal counterparts as well. For example, he let it be known that his province would never accept francophone Catholic Real Caouette, leader of the party's Quebec wing, as the party's leader‚Äîeven though Caouette headed the party's third-strongest faction (behind the Alberta and British Columbia Socreds). This led to rumours that Caouette had defeated Robert N. Thompson for the federal party's leadership in 1961, only to have his win vetoed by Manning and the Alberta Socreds. The discovery of significant reserves of oil in 1947 transformed Alberta from one of Canada's poorest provinces to one of the country's richest with resource revenues pouring into the government's treasury. Decline Manning's last election win, in 1967, proved ominous for the party. Despite winning 55 of the 65 seats in the legislature, it received less than 45% of the popular vote‚Äîits lowest share of the popular vote since 1940. This was a significant drop from 1963, when it took all but six seats. More importantly, the once-moribund Progressive Conservatives, led by young lawyer Peter Lougheed, won six seats, mostly in Calgary and Edmonton. Despite having long-standing support in Calgary and Edmonton (Manning himself represented an Edmonton riding), Social Credit was at bottom an agrarian-based party, and never really lost this character. The party didn't react nearly fast enough to the changes in Alberta as Calgary and Edmonton gained more influence. Manning retired in 1968 and was replaced by Agriculture Minister Harry Strom at the party's first leadership election. However, Strom soon was eclipsed by Lougheed, whose modern and urbane image contrasted sharply with that of the dour Strom. His cause was not helped when the Tories picked up an additional four seats during the term. In the 1971 election, Lougheed's PCs ended Social Credit's 36-year hold on power. The Socred share of the popular vote decreased slightly, but still they finished only five points behind the PCs and won a record number of votes (due in part to Alberta's larger population). While they mostly held their own in their rural heartlands, their support in Edmonton and Calgary plummeted from 1968. The PCs took every seat in Edmonton, and all but five in Calgary. The Socreds lost a number of ridings by a small margin. However, due to the first past the post system, which awards seats to the candidate with the most votes in a district, even if they do not get a majority of votes (and awards power based on seats won), Social Credit's caucus was cut almost in half. It was cut down to 25 seats, and was consigned to the opposition benches for the first time in party history. Strom led the Socreds into opposition, but resigned as party leader in 1973. Former Health Minister James Douglas Henderson became interim leader, and hence Leader of the Opposition. In the 1973 leadership election, Werner Schmidt, vice-president of Lethbridge Community College, who didn't hold a seat in the Legislative Assembly, ran against former Highways Minister Gordon Taylor, former Education Minister Robert Curtis Clark, and John Ludwig, dean of business education at Alberta College.\\"2,000 delegates to Alberta Social Credit meeting pick successor to ex-Premier today\\", Globe and Mail, February 3, 1973 Clark, who had the support of half of the party's MLAs, led Schmidt on the first ballot, 583 votes to 512 votes. But in an upset victory, Schmidt won on the second ballot with 814 votes, defeating Clark by 39 votes.\\"Schmidt wins Alberta Social Credit leadership, upset may split party\\", Globe and Mail, February 5, 1973 First ballot *Clark 583 *Schmidt 512 *Taylor 406 *Ludwig 71 (Ludwig eliminated, Taylor withdraws) Second ballot *Schmidt 814 *Clark 775 Social Credit sank into near-paralysis in opposition. Having spent all but a few months of its history prior to 1971 in government, it was unable to get the better of the Tories. It didn't help matters that Schmidt was never able to get into the legislature; he lost a by-election shortly after taking the leadership. Henderson remained parliamentary leader until September, when Clark succeeded him. The party's support collapsed in the 1975 election, when it fell to four seats‚Äîjust barely holding onto official party status‚Äîand lost half of the popular vote it had received in 1971. Schmidt failed to win a seat and resigned as party leader, leaving Clark to take the leadership unopposed. Under Clark, the party staved off total collapse in the 1979 election, holding onto its four seats. Dormancy in the 1980s Clark returned to the backbench a little more than a year after the election. On November 29, 1980, former Calgary mayor Rod Sykes became the party's new leader, defeating Edmonton alderman Julian Kinisky 538-292.\\"Sykes to enter oil fray\\", The Calgary Herald, December 1, 1980 Again without its leader in the legislature, the party continued to sag in the polls. The beginning of the end for Social Credit came when Clark retired from politics in 1981. His seat of Olds-Didsbury, a longstanding Social Credit bastion, was resoundingly lost to Western Canada Concept. In the process, Social Credit lost official status in the legislature. Unable to resolve the party's internal and financial problems, Sykes quit as leader in March 1982. On March 31, 1982, Social Credit parliamentary leader Raymond Speaker, the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Assembly, announced that Social Credit would sit out that year's election. In his press release, he said it would be useless for Social Credit to fight the next election since there were not enough Social Credit voters left in the province. The Social Credit Party council quickly distanced itself from Speaker's statement. There was wide speculation at the time that Speaker would cross the floor to Western Canada Concept. Unable to attract a new leader, the Social Credit membership held an emergency meeting September 18, 1982. A resolution was put forward that would have dissolved the party. This was soundly rejected by the attending delegates and a new president was elected. As soon as the writs were dropped in October, Speaker and Walt Buck and left the party to become independent candidates for the legislature. The party's third MLA, Fred Mandeville announced his retirement. For the first time since 1935, the party had no incumbents. George Richardson was named acting leader. Social Credit went into the 1982 election in a precarious position. Not only was it without a full-time leader or incumbents, but it had been unable to get its leader elected to the legislature at any point during the parliamentary term. The party ran only 23 candidates and garnered only 0.8 percent of the vote. It was shut out of the Legislative Assembly altogether for the first time, and has never elected another MLA. In 1986, Social Credit, Western Canada Concept and the Heritage Party of Alberta joined to form the Alberta Alliance Political Association. The Alliance fell apart when the WCC left, followed by Social Credit. The AAPA became the present-day Alberta Party. Social Credit sat out the 1986 election. Most of its remaining supporters joined and ran for the Representative Party, which had been formed by Speaker after he and Buck were denied funding normally reserved to opposition parties. Rebirth in the 1990s and decline Interim leadership of the party was given to Martin Hattersley, an Edmonton lawyer, and later to Harvey Yuill of Barrhead. The party ran six candidates in the 1989 election. The party was rekindled under the leadership of Robert Alford from 1990 to 1992. In 1991, Randy Thorsteinson, a Reform Party of Canada activist, was elected as party president. In 1992, Thorsteinson was elected as leader, and Robert Alford as president. Social Credit improved its performance in the 1993 election, but won no seats. In the 1997 election, the party nominated 70 candidates, and won 64,667 votes, over 7% of the popular vote. After the 1997 election, polling revealed that the Social Credit Party was poised for a break-through: an estimated 150,000 Albertans would have been ready to once again support Social Credit as an alternative. This could have meant eight seats in the Legislature. However, in April 1999, Thorsteinson, a devout member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, resigned to protest an internal party proposal to limit Mormon involvement within the party. Social Credit's fortunes quickly faded. In November 1999, James Albers was elected over Jon Dykstra and Norm Racine to lead the party in a hotly contested race. Wiebo Ludwig was disqualified. During the election of 2001, the right wing vote fractured between the newly formed Alberta First Party and Social Credit. Most right-wing voters went back to supporting the Progressive Conservatives, who had experienced a resurgence in popularity. Thorsteinson founded the Alberta Alliance Party in October 2002. Lavern Ahlstrom was appointed Social Credit leader in February 2001. Under Ahlstrom's leadership, the party made moves toward re-embracing elements of social credit monetary theory. The party nominated 12 candidates in the 2001 election (down from 70 in 1997) and received 5,361 votes (0.5% of the popular vote), down from 64,667. The party nominated 42 candidates for the 2004 election, and won 10,874 votes (1.2% of the popular vote, an increase of 0.7% from 2001.) It polled well in a few ridings, most notably Rocky Mountain House where Lavern Ahlstrom tied for second place. In late 2005, the party entered discussion about merging with the Alberta Party and the Alberta Alliance. Despite cooperation and successful merger talks between the party leaders, the Social Credit Party membership voted down the motion to merge at the 2006 Social Credit Convention. (See: and ) In the Drumheller-Stettler by- election on 12 June 2007, the party's candidate Larry Davidson placed third with 11.7% of the vote. Alberta Social Credit in the 21st century In early November 2007, Len Skowronski replaced Lavern Ahlstrom as leader of the party. The party fielded eight candidates for the 2008 general election on March 3. The party received 0.22% of the total or 2,051 votes, a decline of 1.0% from the previous election. The best individual riding result, and the only result over 3.0 percent, was for Wilf Tricker in Rocky Mountain House, who received 6.4% of the vote, finishing fifth in a field of seven candidates, just 0.62% behind the Green candidate and well ahead of the NDP and Separation Party of Alberta candidates. It fielded three candidates in the 2012 election, and garnered 0.023% of the total vote. Its six nominated candidates won 832 votes in the 2015 election, 0.056% of the total vote‚Äîan increase of 0.033% over its 2012 result. In 2016, anti-abortion activist Jeremy Fraser won the party's leadership in what was called an \\"invalid takeover\\" by Skowronski. The party changed its registered name with Elections Alberta to the Pro-Life Alberta Political Association in 2017. Election results {class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align: right;\\" !

It is usually done by interpreting their sprouting behaviour, after some kind of ritual to state the topic of the divination. This often involves inscribing the onions, dedicating them on an altar or something similar. But cromniomancy is/was also done in idiosyncratic way not involving sprouting them. It is not really known why the onion was chosen for that kind of divination, not other fast-sprouting plants. A look at other divination methods shows that plants used for divination have or had some significance as important food source and/or medicinal herb. The onion is rich in Vitamin C and was important because of this, and it was widely used as medicinal herb against colds and other infections. Etymology The word is derived from the Ancient Greek word for onion = Œ∫œÅœåŒºŒºœÖŒøŒΩ(phonetically crom- mee-on) and oracle = ŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒØŒ± (phonetically man-dee-ah). So the original Greek word was: KœÅŒøŒºŒºœÖŒøŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒØŒ± Œóowever, notice that in the original word there is no \\"n = ŒΩ,Œù\\" but two \\"m = Œº,Œú\\" sounds, therefore it is unknown why the word was imported into English as CromNio- instead of CromMio-. History Cromniomancy was historically performed across Europe, Africa and northern Asia. The sphere within a sphere of the onion made it a much-revered symbol of spirituality and eternity, to the extent that the ancient Egyptians took their sacred oaths with their right hand on an onion. There are many forms of cromniomancy, from divining the weather by the thickness of the skin, to gaining inside information. The earliest written mention occurs in Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy, referring to cromnyomantia as a custom of laying onions on an alter on Christmas eve in over to divine when someone will be married. Specific methods One method is to place onions on a sacred altar to learn about friends and family far away and out of contact. The names of the beloved are inscribed on individual onions and left undisturbed until they began to sprout. The faster the sprouting, the better health and happiness was enjoyed by the friend named on the onion. Onions also provided romantic advice for the love-lorn. A woman trying to choose between lovers would carve out their names on separate onions. The one that sprouted first would reveal the suitor most worthy of her affections. Some sources have it that this should best be done on December 1. Answers to any question could be sought by inscribing yes and no on two separate onions and planting them to see which sprouted first. A method practiced in southern Germany to predict the weather for the following year goes like this: At Silvester evening twelve big, sphere- like pieces of onion are taken and put on a wooden board in a row. They represent the months from January to December. Then a grain of salt is put into every piece of onion, and the whole thing is left overnight in a room without heating, but without frost. The amount of liquid in every onion piece tells how much rain/snow there will be in the respective month.

The network, which is branded ITV by ITV plc, has vied with BBC One for the status of the UK's most watched channel since the 1950s (a crown it lost in 2005). The company was formed in 2004, after a corporate takeover by Granada plc (the parent company of Granada Television) of Carlton Communications. Granada acquired a 68% controlling interest of the newly formed company whilst Carlton retained the 32% remaining shares. It began trading on 2 February 2004. That was the most recent stage in a long process of mergers between the original ITV regional franchises. It acquired the remaining 25% of the Breakfast franchise holder, GMTV, from The Walt Disney Company in 2009, Channel Television from Yattendon Group plc in 2011 and UTV for ¬£100 million in 2015, with ownership of the latter transferring to ITV on 29 February 2016. ITV plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History=Pre-merger Former Granada logo Flow diagram displaying consolidation of ITV franchises into ITV plc (prior to the acquisition of UTV) ITV plc was the result of a merger between Granada and Carlton following the various mergers between the companies of the ITV network that had taken place from 1993 when the ownership rules were relaxed. The first wave of mergers began with Yorkshire Television acquiring Tyne Tees Television in 1992, forming a parent group called Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings.An Overview of Television in the UK Ofcom, 2002 In 1994, Carlton Communications ‚Äì which had owned a 20% stake in Central Independent Television ‚Äì acquired the remainder of the company and, because of Central's shareholdings, inherited a 20% stake in Meridian Broadcasting. Later that year, Granada acquired London Weekend Television through a hostile takeover worth in the region of ¬£750 million. MAI, which controlled Meridian Broadcasting, acquired Anglia Television; MAI became United News & Media after merging with United Newspapers ‚Äì owners of The Daily Express in 1996. Ownership rules, that previously restricted ownership of ITV licences by one company to two outright, plus 20% in a third, were relaxed, and so Carlton went on to acquire Westcountry Television (later re-branding it Carlton, along with Central), Granada acquired Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Holdings (with the parent group becoming Granada Media, later simply Granada) and United acquired HTV. Former Carlton Communications logo The idiosyncrasies and business model of the future ITV plc operation can be found in the way these new conglomerates operated their franchises. Carlton re-branded all of its stations with its own name, creating a single identity across the whole expanse of its territory. By contrast, Granada and United, while keeping the franchisees names, centralised their continuity departments ‚Äì Granada in Leeds and United in Southampton. All three, however, merged the network production operations of their franchises, creating Carlton Productions, Granada Content and United Productions.Willis steps into new role at Granada The Guardian, 12 July 2001 By the end of the 1990s, there were three dominating owners of the ITV franchises in England and Wales: Carlton Communications, Granada plc and United News and Media. In 2000, after an aborted merger attempt with Carlton, UNM decided to leave ITV and Granada bought all the UNM franchises, but sold HTV to Carlton in order to comply with the permitted audience percentage covered by a single broadcasting interest. It kept the production arm of HTV, however, renaming it Granada Bristol and moving it out of Bath Road to a new, smaller office in Whiteladies Road (near the BBC). This arm of the company closed in 2006, following later rationalisation of ITV's production operations. The last remaining independent ITV franchise in England and Wales, Border Television, had been bought by Capital Group in 2000, and was sold on to Granada in 2001, with Border's radio assets being retained by Capital Radio plc. The merger In 2004, Granada and Carlton merged, creating a single company for all ITV franchises in England and Wales.Carlton-Granada merger clears last hurdle The Guardian, 2003 One of the consequences of the merger was (according to the company) an over- capacity of studio facilities and production units around the country, which had previously been rivals, but were now all part of the same group. In order to make cost savings, several large regional headquarters, studio sites and programme departments closed and merged. Among the casualties were network production and studio facilities of Tyne Tees in Newcastle upon Tyne, Meridian in Southampton, Central in Nottingham and Anglia in Norwich. In all cases, ITV moved the regional franchisee to a new location complete with hi-tech facilities for news production, but with a minimal number of (physically smaller) studios and the loss of many jobs. Tyne Tees' factual department merged with Yorkshire's in Leeds (which has since closed and re-emerged as Shiver Productions); Meridian's factual and sport production moved to London; all network production in Nottingham was re-allocated to London, Manchester or Leeds (and the local Central News studio moved to Birmingham), and Anglia Factual, reduced to a satellite operation of ITV Studios and primarily producing output for the international market or occasionally third parties in the UK, was eventually closed in January 2012. Post-merger Prior to the merger, and despite being rivals within ITV, Granada and Carlton had already been involved in several joint ventures, including the digital terrestrial television operator ITV Digital that went bankrupt, and collapsed in 2002. They also owned the digital channel ITV2, which had launched on December 1998, and 65% of the (re-branded) ITV News Channel, previously owned by ITN and was originally launched as the ITN News Channel. As well as consolidating its (now 40%) shareholding in ITN itself, the newly merged company was able to buy the final 35% stake in the ITV News Channel from ITN's original partners NTL in April 2004. In November the same year, and following a frantic last-minute deal with BSkyB to buy its half of the Granada Sky Broadcasting joint venture, they launched the digital channel ITV3, replacing Granada Plus which ITV plc closed down on satellite and cable. A year later they launched ITV4. However, due to multiplex issues (and the fact that it was losing money) the ITV News Channel controversially had its hours on Freeview reduced, and was finally closed down on 23 December 2005, with its Freeview space being taken over by replacements ITV4 and CITV, which launched in November 2005 and March 2006, respectively. On 27 April 2005, ITV plc bought SDN, the digital terrestrial franchise holder of Multiplex A (now transmitting ten channels) from its shareholders, S4C and UBM for ¬£134 million. In April 2006 the participation channel ITV Play was launched. It was a block on ITV1. Following a series of scandals surrounding participation TV, the dedicated ITV Play channel was closed down in March 2007, followed by the late-night phone-in quiz shows on the ITV Network in December 2007, however the brand continued to be used for a time for part of the gaming section of itv.com.ITV Play digital channel axed The Guardian, 13 March 2007 In August 2006 the company sold its 45% shareholding in TV3 Ireland, which had been bought by Granada in 2001, to Doughty Hanson & Co. Reorganisation There were rumours of take-over and merger bids during 2006. For example, on 9 November 2006, NTL announced that it had approached ITV plc about a proposed merger. The merger was effectively blocked by British Sky Broadcasting on 17 November 2006 when it bought a 17.9% stake in ITV plc for ¬£940 million, a move that attracted anger from NTL shareholder Richard Branson and an investigation from media and telecoms regulator Ofcom. On 6 December 2006, NTL announced that it had complained to the Office of Fair Trading about BSkyB's move. NTL stated that it had withdrawn its attempt to buy ITV plc, citing that it did not believe that there was any possibility to make a deal on favourable terms. At the same time as the NTL bid, RTL, the then-owner of Channel 5, was also rumoured to be preparing a bid for ITV plc, with the possibility of a stock-swap with BSkyB; the plan would have seen RTL acquiring BSkyB's stake in ITV plc (with the aim of further acquisitions of shares in the future) in exchange for BSkyB taking full control of Channel 5. In the end, no movement was made on this possible deal and RTL sold Channel 5 to Richard Desmond's Northern & Shell Network in July 2010. The company then entered into a series of disposals of non-core activities: in March 2009 the company sold its investment in Friends Reunited (a website dedicated to reunited former school friends or colleagues in a number of countries) which it had acquired in December 2005. Also in May 2009 the company sold Carlton Screen Advertising (the largest cinema advertising business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and now known as Wide Eye Media). In 2010, a large-scale business reorganisation, called the \\"five- year Transformation Plan\\" was launched. Thanks to stringent working capital management and cost management some of the set goals were already achieved in 2012. These include a ranking upgrade (from BB- to BB+), an increase in audience share and reduction of debt (from net debt of ¬£730 million at the end of 2008, to a positive net cash position of ¬£16 million at the end of the first quarter 2012). In December 2013 the company sold its remaining shareholding in STV Group plc (owner of the Scottish and Grampian ITV franchises) which had been bought by Carlton in 1999. On 17 July 2014, BSkyB's 6.4% stake in ITV was sold to Liberty Global, valued at ¬£481 million. On 19 August 2015, ITV purchased UTV for ¬£100m ensuring that 13 out of the 15 licences (it does not hold the two in Scotland) were in its control. In July 2016 the company sold UTV Ireland to Virgin Media. In August 2016, it was revealed that ITV had made an offer to acquire Canadian multinational film and television distributor Entertainment One for around ¬£1 billion. On 10 August 2016, it was announced that eOne had rejected the offer, considering it to be \\"fundamentally undervalued\\". In 2017, it was announced that ITV plc had acquired a majority stake in British Production company World Productions, behind the hit BBC series Line of Duty. As a result of the deal, World Productions is now a part of ITV Studios.

It is one of the corporate laboratories of the Naval Sea Systems Command. NUWC is headquartered in Newport, Rhode Island and has two major subordinate activities: Division Newport and Division Keyport in Keyport, Washington. NUWC also controls the Fox Island facility and Gould Island. It employs more than 4,400 civilian and military personnel, with budgets over $1 billion. The current entity is composed of many elements of Navy undersea research, particularly acoustics and acoustic systems with weapons research and development history dating to the 19th century. Two major laboratories, in Newport and New London composed the largest elements of what is now Division Newport. Those laboratories were themselves made up of consolidated older laboratories and facilities dating from World War I. Early history=Newport, Rhode Island C. 1900, picture of U.S. Torpedo Station on Goat Island In 1869, the U.S. Naval Torpedo Station was founded in Newport, Rhode Island on Goat Island, the site of Fort Wolcott which was built in 1702 and served as an Army fort from 1794 to 1835. During the 1890s, Charles Munroe and John Bernadou worked at Newport, patenting a formulation of nitrocellulose colloided with ether and alcohol which was used as smokeless powder for naval artillery through the two World Wars.Davis, Tenney L. (1943). The Chemistry of Powder & Explosives. pp. 296‚Äì297. The Army adopted the Navy formulation in 1908 and began manufacture at Picatinny Arsenal.Sharpe, Philip B. Complete Guide to Handloading 3rd Edition (1953) Funk & Wagnalls pp. 146‚Äì149 A factory was built in 1907 to manufacture steam torpedoes for the Navy. The torpedo factory became a major employer in the Newport area, as Rhode Island congressmen protected it from competition. The Torpedo Station designed the Mark VI magnetic influence fuze for torpedoes during the 1920s. The Naval Torpedo Station researched and tested underwater weaponry through World Wars I and II, creating additional facilities on Rose Island, Fox Island, and Gould Island. In 1951, the station on Goat Island was reorganized: > For the next 15 years, it was the Underwater Ordnance Station, and then the > Underwater Weapons Research and Engineering Station until 1970. That year, > the Underwater Sound Laboratory from New London, Conn. was combined with the > Newport facility to form the Naval Underwater Systems Center or NUSC.

New London, Connecticut had been the site of World War I sound research since the establishment of the Naval Experimental Station there as a result of meetings between Navy and the Submarine Signal Company, manufacturer of submarine signals as navigation aids and active in underwater acoustics since establishment in 1901, the Western Electric Company and the General Electric Company. The companies, under naval supervision had established an acoustical research station at East Point, Nahant, Massachusetts. The Navy, under one of its officers involved in the corporate effort, established the Naval Experimental Station at Fort Trumbull where physicists and engineers, including scientists from nearby universities, worked under the direction of the Special Board on Antisubmarine Devices. Though that laboratory had closed with the end of that war the same criteria and some of the same people advising made New London the logical place to site the East Coast laboratory in response to the Chief, Bureau of Ships, now Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), April 10, 1941 request to the National Defense Research Committee to establish both an East and West coast antisubmarine warfare research laboratory. On July 1, 1941 the New London laboratory's establishment got approval with management by Columbia University for a wide range of antisubmarine warfare work including, passive sonar, ocean acoustics and recording of underwater sounds for that work. In 1944 the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) directed reorganization of the Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London for peacetime operation consolidating the Harvard Underwater Sound Laboratory, which had focused on physics of underwater sound, surface ship sonar and weapons systems, in Cambridge, Massachusetts with the New London laboratory. After recruiting scientists from both efforts the new Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory was established on March 1, 1945. Significant accomplishments during World War II included the development of greatly improved surface ship and submarine sonar systems, acoustic homing torpedoes, sonobuoys, and acoustic mines. This work contributed greatly to the success against U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic and the near-total destruction of the Imperial Japanese Navy and merchant fleets in the Pacific War.Sherman, Charles H. and Butler, John L., Transducers and Arrays for Underwater Sound, pp. 7‚Äì8, Springer, 2007 . Predecessor organizations Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) lineage chart showing predecessor organizations. Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory (NUSL) 1945‚Äî1970 In July 1945 the Harvard facility's equipment and many of its personnel were moved to the new Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory, New London. NRL oversaw NUSL until turning over direction to the Bureau of Ships. Navy laboratories were reorganized in 1966 under Director of Naval Laboratories, Naval Material Command, to consolidate expertise and decrease competition among laboratories. The Bermuda Research Detachment, Tudor Hill Laboratory after formation of Naval Underwater Systems Center in 1970, and its Argus Island offshore tower and support/research vessel Erline were field detachments of NUSL. The laboratory was unique in that it was the only one in the Atlantic to be located adjacent to and have access to an operational Naval Facility of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). Research intensified during the Cold War, which was as much a technology race with the Soviets as it was an arms race. The Sound Lab's efforts were key to the further development of both submarine and anti- submarine warfare. Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) 1970‚Äî1992 On July 1, 1970 the Naval Material Command independent laboratories, Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London and the Naval Underwater Weapons Research and Engineering Station (NUWS) at Newport, were administratively combined to form the Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) with headquarters in Newport. The Bermuda Research Detachment, formed by NUSL in 1961, became the NUSC Tudor Hill Laboratory, a major field detachment on formation of NUSC in 1970. In July the next year the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) located in the Tongue of the ocean with the main facility on Andros Island, Bahamas, with a logistics component located at the Palm Beach International Airport became a detachment of NUSC. Among the smaller facilities and detachments were the underwater ranges at Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound, field activities at Seneca Lake Facility, New York, Dodge Pond at Niantic, Connecticut, the Central Test and Evaluation Activity (CTEA), Fort Lauderdale, Florida. NUSC was the lead laboratory in partnership with eight North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations to for the instrumented Azores Fixed Acoustic Range (AFAR) in the Azores based on Santa Maria Island. The range features three bottom fixed towers high by across set approximately in an equalateral triangle. Two towers are receive only and one is transmit and receive. The principle studies are in acoustic propagation, reverberations and ambient noise. Much of the work involved sonar suites for both submarines and surface vessels; however, other work ranged from improved periscopes, computing, combat control systems, and communications. Illustrating the wide variety of work are some examples: * NUSC continued work begun by its NUSL predecessor on Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) radio commendations with submarines proving communication with in 1963. That system went operational with first use on an attack submarine with in 1976 and for ballistic missile submarines with two years later. * NUSC became the responsible for design of the MARK 113 fire control systems for Polaris/Poseidon ballistic missile submarines after its design proposal for the MARK 113 MOD 9 Conversion Program was chosen over that of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory. System development had begun at Newport in 1968 and continued after the formation of NUSC with successful introduction and selection of NUSC for oversight in 1971. * Beginning in 1970 NUSC began work for the Naval Electronics Systems Command (NAVELEX) on tactical towed arrays for use by faster surface ships. That work led to NAVELEX sponsorship of research and development of towed surveillance arrays to augment the fixed bottom SOSUS arrays. That work, in cooperation with the NAVELEX Naval Undersea Center (consolidated with Naval Electronics Laboratory Center in 1977 to become Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC)), San Diego, to develop what became the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System. On 2 January 1992 a major consolidation of Navy laboratories resulted in NUSC becoming a part of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station (NUWES) Keyport In 1992 Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station (NUWES) at Keyport, Washington, became Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC), Division Keyport. The station originated with realization that the only torpedo facility was on the Atlantic coast as the Navy increasingly began operating in the Pacific following the Spanish-American War. The Pacific Coast Torpedo Station was established on Puget Sound in 1914. In 1930 the name was changed to Naval Torpedo Station Keyport and in 1978 to Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station. Keyport focused on torpedoes and other undersea weapons and in later decades undersea vehicles. Aside from the ranges at Keyport the station operated ranges in California and Hawthorne, Nevada and Hawaii. Other elements In the early 1940s a need for calibration and testing of sonar transducers was met by establishing the Underwater Sound Reference Laboratory (USRL). It was headquartered in New York with two field stations. One was at Orlando, Florida and the other was at Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. All activities were transferred to Orlando after the war under the Office of Naval Research. In 1966 the organization was renamed the Underwater Sound Reference Detachment (USRD) until its closure in 1997. The functions were transferred to Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Underwater Sound Reference Division. The Orlando lab was built on the archeological site of Fort Gatlin on the shore of Lake Gem Mary because the sinkhole-formed lake is very deep. The Orlando lab closed in 1997 due to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) with all its functions moving to Newport. The Leesburg, Florida deep-water facility at Bugg Spring, established in 1965, remained open. the Orlando building was turned over to civil administration thereafter.

The Consolatio has been put down as late as the 15th century as the work of an Italian imitator, there being no manuscripts and no trace of the poem before the publication of the editio princeps of Ovid in 1471.

Description  roller-furled, and its quadrilateral Fisherman staysail is still in a sailbag. Most staysails are triangular; however, some are four-cornered, notably some fisherman's staysails. Triangular staysails set forward of the foremost mast are called jibs, headsails, or foresails. The innermost such sail on a cutter, schooner, and many other rigs having two or more foresails is referred to simply as the staysail, while the others are referred to as jibs, flying jibs, etc. Types of staysail include the tallboy staysail (a narrow staysail carried between the spinnaker and the mainsail on racing yachts), the genoa staysail (a larger one carried inside the spinnaker when broad reaching), and the bigboy staysail (another name for the shooter or blooper, carried on the leeward side of the spinnaker). Unlike the cutter staysail, none of these sails have their luff affixed to a stay. On large rigs, staysails other than headsails are named according to the mast and mast section on which they are hoisted. Thus, the staysail hoisted on a stay that runs forward and downwards from the top of the mizzen topgallant mast is the mizzen topgallant staysail. If two staysails are hoisted to different points on this mast, they would be the mizzen upper topgallant staysail and the mizzen lower topgallant staysail. Uses In square rigged ships the staysails can help in tacking, overcoming the lumbering square sails' tendency to prevent bearing up to windward, especially in light winds. Where a ship attempts to tack but fails and has to bear away again on the original tack, she is said to have missed her stays. In cutter rigged yachts the genoa will often need to be furled before changing tack due to the difficulty in passing the big sail between the two forestays. Here the staysail can help bring the bow through the wind more effectively.

The New York‚ÄìNew Jersey Harbor Estuary is especially vulnerable to sea level rise. The New York‚ÄìNew Jersey Harbor Estuary, also known as the Hudson-Raritan Estuary, is in the Mid-Atlantic states of New Jersey and New York on the East Coast of the United States. The system of waterways of the Port of New York and New Jersey forms one of the most intricate natural harbors in the world. The harbor opens onto the New York Bight in the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast and Long Island Sound to the northeast. Although the overall form of the estuary remains unchanged from the time of Giovanni da Verrazzano's visit in 1524, all parts have changed at least a little, and some parts, such as Hell Gate and Ellis Island, have been almost completely altered. In the greatest hidden change, the navigational channels have been deepened from the natural depth to . In some places this required blasting of bedrock.http://www.harborestuary.org/watersweshare/pdfs/CRP/2_Existing_Conditions.pdf There is an extremely complex system of tides and currents. Both the Bight and the Sound are essentially marine bodies with tides and saltwater, but the Sound compared to the Atlantic is about 20-30% less saline (as an estuary), and the tide is about 3 hours later with as much as 70% more variation. Rivers add a fresher, non-tidal inflow although the tide and brackishness extend well up rivers NOAA Tides and Current web site FAQ page. See discussion of hydraulic currents throughout the extended hydrologic system from Albany to Montauk Point to the Hudson Canyon region of the New York Bight. The New York Harbor Observing and Prediction System (NYHOPS) utilizes information from sensors, weather forecasts, and environment models to provide real-time forecasts of meteorological and oceanographic conditions in the area. Since the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 beaches along the shores of the East Coast have been regularly replenished with sand pumped in from off-shore. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) coordinates the projects. In 2016 the USACE and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey produced a comprehensive restoration plan for the harbour region, which included proposals to mitigate the effects of sea level rise through projects to restore natural areas.

He was introduced to jazz by his father, Damon Greenleaf Douglas Jr., and as a young teen was shown jazz theory and harmony by the pianist Tommy Gallant. Douglas began performing jazz during his junior year in high school while on an abroad program in Barcelona, Spain. After graduating from high school in 1981, he studied at the Berklee College of Music and New England Conservatory, both located in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1984, Douglas moved to New York to study at New York University, to study directly with Carmine Caruso, and he finished a degree in music. Early gigs included the experimental rock band Dr. Nerve, Jack McDuff, Vincent Herring as well as street bands around New York City. He played with a variety of ensembles and came to the attention of the jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader, Horace Silver, with whom he toured the US and Europe in 1987. In the late 1980s, Douglas began playing with bands led by Don Byron, Tim Berne, Marty Ehrlich, Walter Thompson, and others in New York. He also played in the composer collectives Mosaic Sextet and New and Used. 1990s In March 1993, Douglas got the opportunity to record his first album as a leader, Parallel Worlds (Black Saint/Soul Note), which featured his String Group with Mark Feldman (violin), Erik Friedlander (cello), Mark Dresser (bass), Michael Sarin (drums). The album is a collection of original pieces, some using serial composition techniques, and arrangements of Webern, Ellington, Kurt Weill and Stravinsky. This first recording was followed in quick succession by the debuts of two groups, the Tiny Bell Trio (Songlines) with Brad Shepik and Jim Black and The Dave Douglas Sextet, with Chris Speed, Josh Roseman, Uri Caine, James Genus and Joey Baron, which recorded an homage to Booker Little called In Our Lifetime (New World). This began a period during which Douglas recorded widely as a side musician and as a member of many new jazz groups. Douglas also began touring extensively worldwide both as a leader and as a side musician. In 1993, Douglas also began performing with John Zorn in his Masada quartet, with Greg Cohen and Joey Baron. The group, which still occasionally performs, deals with Jewish and diaspora culture and heritage through Zorn's original compositions. As such, it is an amalgam of jazz, new music, klezmer, and purely improvised styles. The band became one of Zorn's most long-standing and popular ensembles, and brought Douglas wider attention. Since the mid-1990s, Douglas has led a variety of groups simultaneously. In 1996, Douglas recorded Sanctuary with Cuong Vu, Anthony Coleman, Yuka Honda, Dougie Bowne, and other musicians of the New York downtown scene of the time. The group involved sampling and DJ improvisations in addition to jazz. In 1997, Douglas started a quartet featuring trumpet, violin, accordion, and bass (with Guy Lucevsek, Mark Feldman, and Greg Cohen) which recorded Charms of the Night Sky, incorporating sounds of Eastern European and Argentinian folk musics as well as jazz influences on the music, which is generally mellow and relaxed. The album included a number of tracks with Douglas and accordionist Guy Klucevsek performing as a duo. A second album by the Charms of the Night Sky group, A Thousand Evenings was released in 2000. Also in 1997, Douglas founded a jazz quartet with Chris Potter, James Genus, and Ben Perowsky. This group recorded two albums in this period, Magic Triangle and Leap of Faith. Both were originally released by Arabesque Recordings, and have subsequently been reissued on Douglas's own imprint, Greenleaf Music. Greenleaf has also released sheet music containing all of the original compositions from these albums. This group further explored Douglas's interest in writing harmony for cordless groups and lyrical, accessible new acoustic jazz sounds. Towards the end of the 1990s, Douglas formed a Quintet with Uri Caine on fender rhodes, Chris Potter, James Genus and drummer Clarence Penn. The formation of this group coincided with Douglas signing a seven-record deal with major label RCA Victor. Douglas also began to appear at the mainstream jazz clubs around New York such as Iridium, Village Vanguard and Jazz Standard. His international touring continued with multiway residencies of his original works at festivals in Belgium, Italy, Poland, Germany, France and Spain. It was at the end of the 1990s that Douglas first visited the Banff Centre for the Arts as a visiting artist, at the invitation of pianist Kenny Werner. A few year later he would begin a ten-year stint as the Director of the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music. 2000s In 2000, Douglas released Soul on Soul, a tribute to composer and pianist Mary Lou Williams, featuring original arrangements of her music for the sextet and new pieces inspired by her work. Douglas also released albums featuring Charms of the Night Sky and the Dave Douglas Quartet in the same year. In the early years of the decade, Douglas worked often with the Trisha Brown Dance Company. El Trilogy, an extended musical work accompanying modern dance, was performed during 2000‚Äì2001. Witness, a nine-part suite, was released in 2001. It features a band made up of trumpet, sax, two electric pianos, electronic percussion, bass, and drums. Douglas' music had always been informed by his political concerns, but this album was his most ambitious attempt to give them musical form, often by celebrating his political and cultural heroes through dedications and track titles. The album includes a 20-minute track entitled \\"Mahfouz\\", in which gravel-voiced singer Tom Waits reads an excerpt from the works of Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz, as well as pieces dedicated to Edward Said and Taslima Nasrin. More recently, Douglas founded the Dave Douglas New Quintet and Nomad. The Quintet is a trumpet and tenor sax-led group but with Fender Rhodes electric piano. Their first album, The Infinite (2001), featured Douglas originals and pieces by or inspired by musicians Rufus Wainwright, Bj√∂rk and Thom Yorke. This was followed up by 2004's Strange Liberation by the same group with guest Bill Frisell on guitar. Formed in 2003, Nomad is made up of trumpet, clarinet, cello, tuba, and drums. With this band, Douglas performed his suite Mountain Passages, commissioned for the Italian Sound of the Dolomites Festival, and released as the first album on Douglas' record label Greenleaf Music in 2005. The suite features a variety of different influences including Italian Ladino music, New Orleans jazz, and other musics, and is to be played from 9 to 12,000 feet above sea level. Douglas also started a new band called Keystone, which performs works influenced by the silent film actor and director Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle. The project includes pieces to be performed with Arbuckle's films. This ensemble is made up of trumpet, tenor sax, Wurlitzer (electric piano), turntables, electric bass, and drums. A CD of this music ‚Äì accompanied by a DVD with two Arbuckle shorts ‚Äì was released in 2005. 2006 saw Douglas release Meaning and Mystery, where he plays again with his quintet, now with Donny McCaslin in place of Chris Potter on saxophones. In December 2006, Greenleaf Music recorded all the quintet's performances over a six-night engagement at New York's Jazz Standard jazz club, called them Live at the Jazz Standard, and made the two-hour sets the band played each night available for download from the company's website within 24 hours. The 44 compositions, almost all of them by Douglas alongside covers of Wainwright, Mary J. Blige and Bj√∂rk, featured 14 tunes not previously recorded by the band. Those 14 new compositions were released on a 2-CD set, Live at the Jazz Standard, in 2007. In late 2007, Moonshine, a further recording by Keystone, was released. This was based upon recordings made of a concert performance by the band at that year's Bray Jazz Festival in Ireland. The Keystone band then led a 5-night run at Jazz Standard in April 2008. Greenleaf Music recorded and released all ten sets through their website as a download-only series, Keystone: Live at Jazz Standard (Complete Book). In 2009, Douglas released two albums: Spirit Moves by his Brass Ecstasy band which featured Vincent Chancey, Luis Bonilla, Marcus Rojas and Nasheet Waits; and his first album of big band compositions, A Single Sky, a collaboration with Jim McNeely and the Frankfurt Radio Bigband. 2010‚Äìpresent In tandem with the 100th anniversary of the first Frankenstein film, Douglas collaborated with experimental film-maker Bill Morrison and released the 3-CD set Spark of Being. Written for his Keystone ensemble, the set includes three related, yet subtly different, albums to accompany the Morrison film. The first edition, entitled Soundtrack, comprises long-form pieces edited to accompany the film in real time. The second edition, Expand, contains extended performances of the original themes from the soundtrack, arranged in a traditional jazz album format. Burst, the third edition, consists of additional variations and unused outtakes recorded at the initial session. In 2011, Douglas released three albums within the span of five months through Greenleaf Music. The albums were released only in digital format and contained approximately 30 to 50 minutes of music per album, referencing album lengths of the LP era. Released under the unifying label of the Greenleaf Portable Series, or GPS, the albums showcased ensembles that Douglas may only \\"rarely get to play with\\" in some cases. The first album, Rare Metals featured Douglas' Brass Ecstasy ensemble. The second album, Orange Afternoons included Ravi Coltrane on tenor sax, Vijay Iyer on piano, Linda Oh on bass, Marcus Gilmore on drums. The third, Bad Mango, paired Douglas with the innovative quartet So Percussion. Douglas joined with tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano to form the co-led quintet Soundprints in 2012. The group originated during the bandleaders' intersecting tenures in the SFJAZZ Collective in 2008 and is loosely based upon the music of tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter. The group's Village Vanguard debut in November 2012 included drummer Joey Baron, bassist Linda Oh and pianist Lawrence Fields. Douglas released Be Still in 2012. The album featured Douglas' newly formed quintet of Jon Irabagon on saxophone, Matt Mitchell on piano, Linda Oh on bass, and Rudy Royston on drums with the addition of vocalist Aoife O'Donovan. Dedicated to the memory of Douglas' mother, Emily, who died in 2011, Be Still features nine tracks, of which six are hymns and folks songs that she requested Douglas perform at her funeral. The same ensemble, minus O'Donovan, recorded and released Time Travel the following year. Inspired by 2005's Mountain Passages, which the I Suoni delle Dolomiti festival in Northern Italy commissioned to be performed at a high altitude, Douglas initiated his 2013 tenure as the Monterey Jazz Festival's \\"Showcase Artist\\" with a benefit concert and hike at Glen Deven Ranch in Big Sur, California. The audience and performers alike hiked to a promontory overlooking the Pacific Ocean and then listened to a concert of Douglas' music. In celebration of his 50th birthday, Douglas launched his \\"50 States Project\\" and set out to perform in each of the 50 U.S. states throughout the course of 2013. The tour aimed to include performances in \\"unlikely and outdoors locations for people who might not otherwise have the same kind of access to live, improvised music as those in larger cities.\\" In 2014, Douglas formed a collaboration with tenor saxophonist Chet Doxas, electric bassist Steve Swallow, and drummer Jim Doxas. Collectively known as Riverside, the group formed out of a shared respect for Texas-born multireedist Jimmy Giuffre. The group's eponymously-titled recording features originals by Douglas and Doxas, as well as Giuffre's \\"The Train and the River\\".

Life He was born on 6 August 1821, being the son of Edward Hallows Plumptre, a London solicitor. Charles John Plumptre was his brother. He was educated at home, and after a brief stay at King's College, London, entered Oxford as a scholar of University College, Oxford, of which his uncle, Frederick Charles Plumptre (1796‚Äì1870), was master from 1836 till his death. In 1844, he took a double first-class, alone in mathematics, and in classics with Sir George Bowen, Dean Bradley, and E. Poste. He was elected to a fellowship at Brasenose College, which he resigned three years afterwards, on his marriage with Harriet Theodosia, sister of Frederick Denison Maurice. For some years the influence of his brother-in-law was apparent in his religious views, but as he advanced in life he identified himself with no party. Service He was ordained in 1847, by Bishop Wilberforce, he proceeded M.A. in 1847, and joined the staff of King's College London. There his work mainly lay for twenty-one years, and he enlarged the scope of the institution by introducing evening classes. From 1847 to 1868, he was chaplain there, from 1853 to 1863 professor of pastoral theology, and from 1864 to 1881 professor of exegesis. He proved a most sympathetic teacher, and took a genuine interest in the future welfare of his pupils. He also took a leading part in promoting the higher education of women as a professor of Queen's College, Harley Street, where he held the office of principal during the last two years of his work there (1875‚Äì77). Throughout this period he was also occupied in clerical work. From 1851 to 1858, he was assistant preacher at Lincoln's Inn, and in 1863 prebendary of St. Paul's. He was rector of Pluckley from 1869 and of Bickley from 1873. He was Boyle lecturer in 1866, and the lectures were afterwards published under the title of 'Christ and Christendom.' From 1869 to 1874, he was a member of the Old Testament revision committee, and from 1872 to 1874 Grinfield lecturer and examiner at Oxford. In 1881, he resigned his work in London on becoming dean of Wells. He was an ideal dean, possessing a genuine talent for business, and being always ready to consider the suggestions of others. Not only the cathedral and the Theological College, but the city of Wells, its hospital, its almshouse, and its workhouse, commanded his service. Plumptre died on 1 February 1891 at the deanery of Wells, and was buried in the cathedral cemetery beside his wife, who had predeceased him on 3 April 1889. The marriage was childless. Published works Meanwhile, his pen was never idle. He wrote much on the interpretation of scripture, endeavouring to combine and popularise, in no superficial fashion, the results attained by labourers in special sections of the subject. He contributed to the commentaries known respectively as the Cambridge Bible, the Speaker's Commentary, that edited by Bishop Ellicott, and the Bible Educator (serial from 1873‚Äì75). He also wrote Biblical Studies, 1870 (3rd edit. 1885), St. Paul in Asia (1877), a Popular Exposition of the Epistles to the Seven Churches (1877 and 1879), Movements in Religious Thought: Romanism, Protestantism, Agnosticism (1879), and Theology and Life (1884). His most remarkable theological work was The Spirits in Prison, and other studies on Life after Death (1884 and 1885). The book comprises a review of previous teaching on the subject of eschatology. His characteristic sympathy with 'the larger hope' is moderated throughout by a characteristic caution. He had passed beyond the influence of Maurice, and, though his loyal admiration for his earlier teacher remained unchanged, he had rejected his conclusions. In 1888, he issued a little work on Wells Cathedral and its Deans, and in the same year appeared his Life of Bishop Ken. Though diffuse, the book has something of the charm of Walton's Lives, and breathes the still air of a cathedral. Its main defect is the occasional intrusion of conjectural or 'ideal' biography. Plumptre published several volumes of verse. He had a keen perception of literary excellence, unappeasable ambition, and unwearied industry; but his gifts were hardly sufficient to insure him a place among the poets. Lazarus and other poems appeared in 1864, 8vo (3rd edit. 1868); Master and scholar, which was warmly praised in the Westminster Review, in 1866, 8vo; and Things New and Old in 1884, 8vo. All his pieces are refined and earnest; few are really forcible. Several of Plumptre's hymns have been admitted into popular collections, and satisfy their not very exacting requirements. He also translated with much success the plays of Sophocles (1865) and of √Üschylus (1868), and thus gave readers ignorant of Greek some adequate conception of the masterpieces of Attic drama. For twenty years he studied Dante, and his English version of Dante's work appeared as The Divina Commedia and Canzoniere of Dante Alighieri; with Biographical Introduction, Notes and Essays (vol. i. 1886, 8vo, vol. ii. 1887). Plumptre's notes condense all that history or tradition can tell us of the author. But the translation itself is hampered by a too strict adherence, in our stubborn tongue, to the metrical form of the original.

Individual pieces of tagliatelle are long, flat ribbons that are similar in shape to fettuccine and are typically about wide. Tagliatelle can be served with a variety of sauces, though the classic is a meat sauce or Bolognese sauce. Tagliolini is another variety of tagliatelle that is long and cylindrical in shape, not long and flat. The name is from the Italian verb ‚Äútagliare‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúto cut.‚Äù Both tagliolini and tagliatelle are traditionally made with egg pasta. The traditional ratio is one egg to one hundred grams of Durum wheat semolina. Bavette are also available, and are thinner than tagliatelle; an even thinner version is bavettine. Origins Legend has it that tagliatelle was created by a talented court chef, who was inspired by Lucrezia d'Este's hairdo on the occasion of her marriage to Annibale II Bentivoglio, in 1487. In reality, this was a joke invented by humorist Augusto Majani in 1931. The recipe was called tagliolini di pasta e sugo, alla maniera di Zafiran (tagliolini of pasta and sauce in the manner of Zafiran) and it was served on silver plates. Over the years, tagliatelle has become considered a more common food. A glass case in the Bologna Chamber of Commerce holds a solid gold replica of a piece of tagliatelle, demonstrating the correct dimensions of 1 millimeter by 6 millimeters.The Classic Italian Cookbook, 1973 by Marcella Hazan Dishes The texture is porous and rough, making it ideal for thick sauces, generally made with beef, veal, or pork (such as bolognese sauce), and occasionally with rabbit, as well as several other less rich (and more vegetarian) options, such as briciole e noci (with breadcrumbs and nuts), uovo e formaggio (with eggs and cheese‚Äîa less rich carbonara), or simply pomodoro e basilico (with tomatoes and basil).

In the early 1900s, the area was heavily mined for silver; the silver ore also contained cobalt. By 1910, the community was the fourth highest producer of silver in the world. Mining declined significantly by the 1930s, together with the local population. In late 2017 one publication referred to Cobalt as a ghost town, but the high demand for cobalt, used in making batteries for mobile devices and electric vehicles, is leading to great interest in the area among mining companies. History Lang Street in Cobalt, 1911 Silver mines in Cobalt, around 1918 W.E. Logan discovered cobalt in 1884 at the future site of the Agaunico Mine, one mile south of Haileybury. Silver was discovered in the area during the construction of the Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway (T&NO;) from North Bay to the communities of Haileybury and New Liskeard, north of Cobalt. The discovery was made in 1903, near Long Lake (later called Cobalt Lake), by Ernest Darragh and James McKinley, who were supplying railway ties. Later that year, Tom H√©bert found a rich vein on the east side of Cobalt Lake and began a business with hotel owner Arthur Ferland. The silver from both sites was consistently high-grade. Boomtown The subsequent Cobalt silver rush led to the development of the McKinley Darragh, La Rose, Nipissing, and O'Brien silver mines. In 1904, Willet Miller, on a visit to Mile 104 on the T&NO;, along with brothers Noah and Henry Timmins, named the future town Cobalt. The Timmins brothers bought the remaining claims from Fred La Rose, and erected some cabins. Speculation over mining stocks on Wall Street in New York City required mounted police to control the crowds. The town was incorporated in 1906. By 1908, the camp was considered the world's largest producer of silver and of the cobalt which is a byproduct of the process. In 1911, the 34 mines produced over 30 million ounces (937.5 tons) of silver. The town's population soared to 10,000 by 1909. Mining continued until the 1930s, then slowed to a trickle. Activity renewed in the 1950s then slowly dropped off, and since the 1980s, there have been no operating mines in the area. By the 1960s, the area had produced over 420 million ounces of silver. One mill still operated in the area in 2017, and exploration for diamonds and other minerals was ongoing. The silver mines of Cobalt, and the prospectors and miners who discovered them and worked them, left an indelible mark on Canadian history, and the town is known as the birthplace of hard rock mining in Canada. The ore in Cobalt was close to surface, so men with limited experience could prospect, begin mining, and then hone their skills as the mines went deeper. Those who learned their trade in Cobalt moved north, discovering gold in Kirkland Lake and Timmins and further afield in Canada and around the world. Cobalt mining was done with the use of wheelbarrows, pickaxes, hand steel and dynamite. Fires Cobalt suffered two devastating fires in the 20th century. In 1909, a fire in a cafe spread quickly through debris and garbage-filled alleyways. Half the town was destroyed; 150 buildings were lost and 3,000 residents left homeless; by that time the water table had been contaminated and a typhoid outbreak earlier in the year had killed 111 people. Fire protection at the time was inadequate and firefighters were forced to dynamite buildings to create a firebreak.The Cobalt Adventure. Retrieved on 2015-03-08. On a hot and windy Victoria Day in 1977, a discarded cigarette started a fire that destroyed 140 buildings and left over 400 homeless.The Cobalt Adventure. Retrieved on 2015-03-08. Hockey The Cobalt Silver Kings played in the inaugural 1910 NHA season. Administration Cobalt, Haileybury, and New Liskeard were formerly known as the Tri-Towns. When Haileybury and New Liskeard were amalgamated into the city of Temiskaming Shores in 2004, Cobalt decided to remain a separate town. However, the two municipalities continue to have a close relationship, including the operation of a shared public transit system. In 2001 Cobalt was named \\"Ontario's Most Historic Town\\" by a in panel of judges on the TV Ontario program Studio 2, and in 2002 the \\"Cobalt Mining District\\" was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Renewed interest in cobalt and silver mining Cobalt is a byproduct of silver mining and was not of significant interest as a mineral until recently; in fact, many considered it to be a \\"nuisance\\". Today, however, it is a critical component in the types of rechargeable lithium battery used in millions of mobile devices and in electric cars, and demand is expected to increase. This application for the mineral was not yet possible in the mid-1980s when the last mining company, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited, ceased operations in the area. Cobalt is always mixed not only with silver but also with copper, nickel and other metals. By 2017, several cobalt exploration companies were focusing on the area around Cobalt, as one alternative to cobalt mining in the politically-unstable Democratic Republic of Congo. Roughly 60% of the world's cobalt is mined in the Congo, much of it using child labour in very poor working conditions. Major companies that require this mineral for their batteries were searching for ethically-sourced product. The shortage of such cobalt is a primary reason for the 300% increase in the price of this commodity since 2015. Stock prices of First Cobalt Corp. and Cobalt 27 Capital Corp. had soared in 2017 based on this prospect. The CEO of First Cobalt made this comment after returning from a trip to the U.S., Europe, Australia and Asia: \\"We've got some of the biggest resource companies in the world interested\\". In October, the company was planning to prospect the Caswell, Ophir and Silver Banner areas, as well as mines around Kerr Lake and Maiden Lake, via the staff of Bjorkman Prospecting of Whiskey Jack, Ontario. At the time, First Cobalt was negotiating a merger with two other companies, Cobalt One and CobalTech. If the merger is completed, the group expected to control about 45% of the potential mining properties in the Cobalt area including 50 mines that previously produced cobalt and silver; a competitor, Agnico Eagle, controls approximately 21%. However the latter ceased production there in the 1980s. Silver was selling for US$17 per ounce in late November 2017, down significantly from its peak of US$50 in 2012, but cobalt was at about US$31 per pound at that time, up significantly from the US$10 price in late 2015. The prices will increase according to Gino Chitaroni, the president of the Northern Prospectors' Association. He also predicted that the area around Cobalt would be a primary source of both minerals. \\"It's spectacular ... We have the infrastructure. We have a historic mining area. It puts us a step up on anywhere [else] in the world.\\" In March 2017, the town's mayor estimated that mining production could start in about three to five years. Demographics Mother tongue (2006): * English as first language: 76.0% * French as first language: 19.5% * English and French as first language: 2.0% * Other as first language: 2.4% Environmental issues The mining activities in Cobalt have left a significant environmental legacy. Millions of tons of mine waste rock and mill tailings were dumped on the land and in local lakes. In cobalt ores, silver was associated with arsenic minerals. Little of this arsenic was ever recovered, with most of it ended up in the tailings and waste rock. Today this arsenic contaminates surface water in the area and poses risks to the environment. Sediment samples from surrounding lakes showed elevated concentration levels of nickel, copper and arsenic while water samples exceeded the provincial water quality guideline for cobalt and arsenic. Fish from five of the lakes around Cobalt had mercury concentration which exceeded the consumption limit as well as elevated concentration for arsenic. The Cobalt area is also laced with many miles of underground mine workings, surface trenches, pits and shaft openings. As a result, there are risks of collapse, or subsidence of underground mine workings, and many areas have been fenced off to prevent entry. Tourism and attractions Historic mine in Cobalt, 2007. Main street Cobalt Visitors to Cobalt can visit the Cobalt Mining Museum, which boasts the world's largest display of silver, as well as \\"The Bunker\\" military museum and the Northern Ontario Firefighters Museum. The Heritage Silver Trail is a self-guided driving tour of several mine and mill sites in the area. The trail is well marked, guiding visitors around the backroads of Cobalt. At each site, signs are posted, identifying the site, and providing a brief description of the site. The trail guides visitors to many of the remaining mine headframes in the Cobalt area, some of which are quite picturesque, and stand as an important reminder of Cobalt's past. Visitors can also take a tour of an old underground mine. Tours start at the Mining Museum, and are guided by museum staff. The narrow damp tunnels of the mine give a real appreciation for the conditions under which miners worked, and tour guides sprinkle the tour with many stories to help bring the past to life. On February 14, 2008, plans were announced to convert the vacant Fraser Hotel building into a complex which will include The Bunker museum, housing units, tourist accommodations, and a proposed culinary school.

It is black with yellow spots or stripes to a varying degree; some specimens can be nearly completely black while on others the yellow is dominant. Shades of red and orange may sometimes appear, either replacing or mixing with the yellow according to subspecies. Fire salamanders can have a very long lifespan; one specimen lived for more than 50 years in Museum Koenig, a German natural history museum.  Habitat, behavior and diet  Fire salamanders live in central Europe forests and are more common in hilly areas. They prefer deciduous forests since they like to hide in fallen leaves and around mossy tree trunks. They need small brooks or ponds with clean water in their habitat for the development of the larvae. Whether on land or in water, fire salamanders are inconspicuous. They spend much of their time hidden under wood or other objects. They are active in the evening and the night, but on rainy days they are active in the daytime as well. The diet of the fire salamander consists of various insects, spiders, earthworms and slugs, but they also occasionally eat newts and young frogs. In captivity, they eat crickets, mealworms, waxworms and silkworm larvae. Small prey will be caught within the range of the vomerine teeth or by the posterior half of the tongue, to which the prey adheres. It weighs about 40 grams. The fire salamander can grow to be long.  Reproduction  Males and females look very similar except during the breeding season when the most conspicuous difference is a swollen gland around the male's vent. This gland produces the spermatophore, which carries a sperm packet at its tip. The courtship happens on land. After the male becomes aware of a potential mate, he confronts her and blocks her path. The male rubs her with his chin to express his interest in mating, then crawls beneath her and grasps her front limbs with his own in amplexus. He deposits a spermatophore on the ground, then attempts to lower the female's cloaca into contact with it. If successful, the female draws the sperm packet in and her eggs are fertilized internally. The eggs develop internally and the female deposits the larvae into a body of water just as they hatch. In some subspecies, the larvae continue to develop within the female until she gives birth to fully formed metamorphs. Breeding has not been observed in neotenic fire salamanders. In captivity, females may retain sperm long-term and use the stored sperm later to produce another clutch. This behavior has not been observed in the wild, likely due to the ability to obtain fresh sperm and the degradation of stored sperm.  Toxicity  Samandarin structure The fire salamander's primary alkaloid toxin, samandarin, causes strong muscle convulsions and hypertension combined with hyperventilation in all vertebrates. The poison glands of the fire salamander are concentrated in certain areas of the body, especially around the head and the dorsal skin surface. The coloured portions of the animal's skin usually coincide with these glands. Compounds in the skin secretions may be effective against bacterial and fungal infections of the epidermis; some are potentially dangerous to human life.  Distribution  Video of a Fire Salamander in its natural habitat in Austria Fire salamanders are found in most of southern and central Europe. They are most commonly found at altitudes between and , only rarely below (in Northern Germany sporadically down to ). However, in the Balkans or Spain they are commonly found in higher altitudes as well.  Subspecies  Several subspecies of the fire salamander are recognized.

Early life Ken was born in 1637 at Little Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire. His father was Thomas Ken of Furnival's Inn, of the Ken family of Ken Place, in Somerset; his mother was the daughter of little known English poet John Chalkhill. In 1646 Ken's stepsister, Anne, married Izaak Walton, author of The Compleat Angler, a connection which brought Ken under the influence of this gentle and devout man. In 1652 Ken entered Winchester College, and in 1656 became a student of Hart Hall, Oxford. He gained a fellowship at New College in 1657, and proceeded B.A. in 1661 and M.A. in 1664. He was for some time tutor of his college; but the most characteristic reminiscence of his university life is the mention made by Anthony Wood that in the musical gatherings of the time Thomas Ken of New College, a junior, would be sometimes among them, and sing his part. Ordained in 1662, he successively held the livings of Little Easton in Essex, St. Mary's Church, Brighstone\\"Three famous men of Brighstone\\" Sibley,P Brighstone, Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Brighstone in the Isle of Wight, and East Woodhay in Hampshire; in 1672 he resigned the last of these, and returned to Winchester, being by this time a prebendary of the cathedral, and chaplain to the bishop, as well as a fellow of Winchester College. He remained there for several years, acting as curate in one of the lowest districts, preparing his Manual of Prayers for the use of the Scholars of Winchester College (first published in 1674), and composing hymns. It was at this time that he wrote, primarily for the same body as his prayers, his morning, evening and midnight hymns, the first two of which, beginning \\"Awake, my soul, and with the sun\\" and \\"Glory to Thee, my God, this night\\", are well known. The latter is often made to begin with the line \\"All praise to Thee, my God, this night\\", which is how it appeared in a 1692 pamphlet printed by Richard Smith. However, this publication was likely made without Ken's permission, and subsequent editions over which he had control revert to \\"Glory to Thee, my God, this night\\". Both of these hymns end with a doxology beginning \\"Praise God, from whom all blessings flow,\\" which is widely sung today by itself, often to the tune Old 100th.The Hymnal of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America (1940). New York: Church Pension Fund. # 139. \\"Awake, my soul, and with the sun\\" was included as Hymn 1 in the first edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, while \\"Glory to Thee, my God, this night\\" was Hymn 10.Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861). London: Novello & Co. In 1674 Ken paid a visit to Rome in company with his nephew, the young Izaak Walton, and this journey seems mainly to have resulted in confirming his regard for the Anglican communion. Ken and Charles II In 1679, Ken was appointed by Charles II chaplain to the Princess Mary, wife of William of Orange. While with the court at the Hague, he incurred the displeasure of William by insisting that a promise of marriage, made to an English lady of high birth by a relative of the prince, should be kept; and he therefore gladly returned to England in 1680, when he was immediately appointed one of the king's chaplains. He was once more residing at Winchester in 1683 when Charles came to the city with his slightly disreputable court. His residence was chosen as the home of Nell Gwynne, the King's official mistress. Ken stoutly objected and succeeded in making the favourite find quarters elsewhere.Southey, Robert (1812). \\"Bishop Kenn\\" Omniana, Longman London In August of this same year he accompanied Lord Dartmouth to Tangier as chaplain to the fleet, and Pepys, who was one of the company, has left on record some quaint and kindly reminiscences of him and of his services on board. The fleet returned in April 1684, and a few months later, upon a vacancy occurring in the see of Bath and Wells, Ken was appointed bishop. It is said that, upon the occurrence of the vacancy, the King, mindful of the spirit he had shown at Winchester, exclaimed, \\"Where is the good little man that refused his lodging to poor Nell?\\" and determined that no other should be bishop. The consecration took place at Lambeth on 25 January 1685; and one of Ken's first duties was to attend the death-bed of Charles, where his wise and faithful ministrations won the admiration of everybody except Bishop Burnet. In this year he published his Exposition on the Church Catechism, perhaps better known by its sub-title, The Practice of Divine Love. Ken and James II Group portrait of the Seven Bishops In 1688, when James reissued his Declaration of Indulgence, Ken was one of the Seven Bishops who refused to publish it. He was probably influenced by two considerations: first, by his profound aversion to Roman Catholicism, to which he felt he would be giving some episcopal recognition by compliance; but, second and more especially, by the feeling that James was compromising the spiritual freedom of the church. Along with his six brethren, Ken was committed to the Tower on 8 June 1688, on a charge of high misdemeanour. Ken was put on trial with the others on 29 and 30 June, which resulted in a verdict of acquittal. The nonjuring schism With the Glorious Revolution which speedily followed this impolitic trial, new troubles encountered Ken; for, having sworn allegiance to James, he thought himself thereby precluded from taking the oath to William of Orange. Accordingly, he took his place among the non-jurors, and, as he stood firm to his refusal, he was, in August 1691, superseded in his bishopric by Dr Richard Kidder, dean of Peterborough. From this time he lived mostly in retirement, finding a congenial home with Lord Weymouth, his friend from college days, at Longleat in Wiltshire; and though pressed by Queen Anne to resume his diocese in 1703, upon the death of Bishop Kidder, he declined, partly on the ground of growing weakness, but partly no doubt from his love for the quiet life of devotion which he was able to lead at Longleat. He did however persuade George Hooper to accept and made a cession to him. At Hooper's instigation, Queen Anne granted Ken a pension of ¬£200.JWC Wand The High Church Schism, The Faith Press, 1951. He died there on 19 March 1711. and at dawn the following day, whilst his faithful friends sang \\"Awake, my soul, and with the sun\\" Bishop Ken's remains were laid to rest beneath the East Window of the Church of St. John in Frome ‚Äì the nearest parish in his old Diocese of Bath and Wells. \\"I am dying,\\" Ken had written, \\"in the Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Faith professed by the whole Church before the disunion of East and West; and, more particularly, in the Communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from both Papal and Protestant innovation, and adheres to the Doctrine of the Cross.\\" Lodger at Longleat A View of Longleat, Jan Siberechts, 1675 When deprived of his see by William and Mary in 1691 after he refused to transfer his oath of allegiance from James, on the grounds that once given, it could not be forsworn, he was given lodgings at Longleat and an ¬£80 annuity by Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, a friend since Oxford days. Taking up residence on the top floor at Longleat for a period of some twenty years, he exerted a profound influence upon Thomas Thynne, becoming what some might describe as his conscience. Thynne thus acquired a reputation for good deeds, which he himself regarded as spontaneous enough, but which the friends of his youth were inclined to regard as having been inspired by his devout friend, the Bishop. An example of such benevolence: In 1707, Thynne, influenced by Ken, founded a grammar school for boys in the nearby market town of Warminster, with 23 free places for local boys. Originally The Lord Weymouth School (and known locally as The Latin School), in 1973 this school merged with St Monica's School for Girls to become the co-educational Warminster School, which continues to this day. Ken is remembered at Warminster School by the naming of a competitive 'house' after him. Notable too is the fact that a portion of the West Wing of Longleat was transformed into a chapel for the household's daily worship. Not that its interior ever matched the architectural finery of equivalent chapels in other stately homes, but it was in any case evidence of the devout spirit which prevailed at Longleat over that particular historical period. While living in the house at Longleat, Ken wrote many of his famous hymns, including 'Awake my soul', and, when he died in 1711, bequeathed his extensive library to the 1st Viscount. Ken's reputation and legacy Although Ken wrote much poetry, besides his hymns, he cannot be called a great poet; but he had that fine combination of spiritual insight and feeling with poetic taste which marks all great hymn-writers. As a hymn-writer he has had few equals in England; he wrote Praise God from whom all blessings flow.The Hymnal of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America (1940). New York: Church Pension Fund. #139.Baptist Hymn Book (1962). Psalms and Hymn Trust, London. It can scarcely be said that even John Keble, though possessed of much rarer poetic gifts, surpassed him in his own sphere. In his own day he took high rank as a pulpit orator, and even royalty had to beg for a seat amongst his audiences; but his sermons are now forgotten. He lives in history, apart from his three hymns, mainly as a man of unstained purity and invincible fidelity to conscience, weak only in a certain narrowness of view. As an ecclesiastic he was a High Churchman of the old school. Crypt of Thomas Ken at the Church of St John the Baptist, Frome Ken's poetical works were published in collected form in four volumes by W. Hawkins, his relative and executor, in 1721; his prose works were issued in 1838 in one volume, under the editorship of J. T. Round. A brief memoir was prefixed by Hawkins to a selection from Ken's works which he published in 1713; and a life, in two volumes, by the Rev. W. L. Bowles, appeared in 1830. But the standard biographies of Ken are those of J. Lavicount Anderdon (The Life of Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, by a Layman, 1851; 2nd ed., 1854) and of Dean Plumptre (2 vols., 1888; revised, 1890). See also the Rev. W. Hunt's article in the Dictionary of National Biography. He was buried at the Church of St John the Baptist, Frome, where his crypt can still be seen. He is also commemorated with a statue in niche 177 on the West Front of Salisbury Cathedral. Ken is honoured with a Lesser Festival on the liturgical calendar of the Church of England on 8 June.Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England (2000). London: Church House Publishing. p. 10. He is also commemorated on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 21 March.The Book of Common Prayer (1979). The Episcopal Church.

Ken The interior has a coffin-shaped slab with empty metal banding over with only a crozier and a mitre on it. Bishop Ken (1637‚Äì1711) was one of the seven Bishops who refused the oath of Indulgence 1689 to William and Mary and was consequently deprived of his See of Bath and Wells. Hence the symbolism: an empty grave, and empty coffin, outside the church.

First settlers to claim Hawaii was sometime between 124 and 1120 AD, when the islands were first settled by Polynesians. Hawaiian civilization was isolated from the rest of the world for at least 500 years. Europeans led by British explorer James Cook were among the initial imperialistic groups to arrive in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. However, Spanish historians and some other researchers state that the Spanish captain Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos was the first European to see the islands in 1542. The Spanish named these islands \\"Isla de Mesa, de los Monjes y Desgraciada\\" (1542), being on the route linking the Philippines with Mexico across the Pacific Ocean, between the ports of Acapulco and Manila, which were both part of New Spain.Haw√°ii National Park. (June 1959). \\"Haw√°ii Nature Notes\\". The Publication of the Naturalist Division, Haw√°ii National Park, and the Haw√°ii Natural History Association. Within five years after Cook's arrival, European military technology helped Kamehameha I conquer and unify the islands for the first time, establishing the Kingdom of Hawaii. The kingdom was prosperous and important for its agriculture and strategic location in the Pacific. American immigration began almost immediately after Cook's arrival, led by Protestant missionaries. Americans set up plantations to grow sugar. Their methods of plantation farming required substantial labor. Waves of permanent immigrants came from Japan, China, and the Philippines to work in the fields. The government of Japan organized and gave special protection to its people, who comprised about 25 percent of the Hawaiian population by 1896.Thomas A. Bailey, \\"Japan's Protest Against the Annexation of Hawaii,\\" Journal of Modern History 3#1 (1931): 46-61. https://doi.org/10.1086/235690. The native population succumbed to disease brought by the Europeans (particularly smallpox), declining from 300,000 in the 1770s to over 60,000 in the 1850s to 24,000 in 1920. Americans within the kingdom government rewrote the constitution, severely curtailing the power of King \\"David\\" KalƒÅkaua, and disenfranchising the rights of most Native Hawaiians and Asian citizens to vote, through excessively high property and income requirements. This gave a sizeable advantage to plantation owners. Queen Liliuokalani attempted to restore royal powers in 1893 but was placed under house arrest by businessmen with help from the US military. Against the Queen's wishes, the Republic of Hawaii was formed for a short time. This government agreed on behalf of Hawaii to join the US in 1898 as the Territory of Hawaii. In 1959, the islands became the state of Hawaii of the United States.  Ancient Hawaii=Discovery and settlement Chronological dispersal of Austronesian people across the Pacific The date of the first settlements of the Hawaiian Islands is a topic of continuing debate. Patrick Vinton Kirch's books on Hawaiian archeology, standard textbooks, date the first Polynesian settlements to about 300, with more recent suggestions by Kirch as late as 600. Other theories suggest dates as late as 700 to 800. The most recent survey of carbon-dating evidence puts the arrival of the first settlers at around A.D. 940‚Äì1130. The history of the ancient Polynesians was passed down through genealogy chants that were recited at formal and family functions. The genealogy of the high chiefs could be traced back to the period believed to be inhabited only by gods. The pua ali ªi (\\"flower of royalty\\") were considered to be living gods. By about 1000, settlements founded along the perimeters of the islands were beginning to cultivate food in gardens. A Tahitian priest named PƒÅ‚Äòao is said to have brought a new order to the islands around 1200. The new order included new laws and a new social structure that separated the people into classes. The ali ªi nui was the king, with his  ªaha kuhina just below them. The ali ªi were the royal nobles with the kahuna (high priest) below them, the maka ªƒÅinana (commoners) next with the kauƒÅ below them as the lowest ranking social caste. The rulers of the Hawaiian islands (noho ali ªi o ko Hawai ªi Pae  ªAina) are a line of Native Hawaiians who were independent rulers of various subdivisions of the islands of Hawaii. Their genealogy is traced to HƒÅnala ªanui and others. The ali ªi nui were responsible for making sure the people observed a strict kapu (a code of conduct relating to taboos). The system had rules regarding many aspects of Hawaiian social order, fishing rights and even where women could eat. After the death of Kamehameha I, the system was abolished, and the Hawaiian religion soon fell as the gods were abandoned. By 1500 Hawaiians began to spread to the interiors of the islands and religion was more emphasized. Religion Kailua-Kona, Island of Hawaii Religion in Hawaii is much the same as most other Polynesian cultures, with a theology, ritual and a code of conduct. There are many gods and heroes. WƒÅkea, the Sky Father, wed PapahƒÅnaumoku, the Earth Mother. From their union came all others, including the other gods. Hawaiian religion was polytheistic, with four deities most prominent: KƒÅne, K≈´, Lono and Kanaloa. Other notable deities include Laka, Kihawahine, Haumea, PapahƒÅnaumoku, and, most famously, Pele. In addition, each family is considered to have one or more guardian spirits or family gods known as  ªaumakua to protect them. One such god is Iolani, the god of alii families. One breakdown of the Hawaiian pantheon consists of the following groups: * four major gods (ka hƒÅ) ‚Äì K≈´, KƒÅne, Lono, Kanaloa * forty male gods or aspects of KƒÅne (ke kanahƒÅ) * four hundred gods and goddesses (ka lau) * a multitude of gods and goddesses (ke kini akua) * spirits (na unihipili) * guardians (na aumƒÅkua) Another breakdownKauka, Jay. Religious Beliefs and Practices. consists of three major groups: * four gods, or akua: K≈´, KƒÅne, Lono, Kanaloa * many lesser gods, or kupua, each associated with certain professions * guardian spirits, aumakua, associated with particular families Liloa, HƒÅkau and  ªUmi a Lƒ´loa Liloa = Lƒ´loa was a legendary ruler of the island of Hawaii in the late 15th century. His royal compound was in Waipi ªo Valley. His line is traced to Hawaiian \\"creation\\". Lƒ´loa had two sons; his firstborn HƒÅkau from his wife Pinea, (his mother's sister), and his second son,  ªUmi a Lƒ´loa from his lesser ranking wife, Akahi a Kuleana. Upon his death, elevated HƒÅkau as ruler and delegated religious authority to  ªUmi. Akahi a Kuleana was of a lesser line of chiefs who Liloa had fallen in love with when he discovered her bathing in a river. The couple met when Liloa was visiting Hamakua. He claimed his right to her as King and she accepted. Liloa's KƒÅ ªei is his sacred feathered sash, now kept at the Bishop Museum.[] Lƒ´loa was the first born son of Kiha nui lulu moku, one of the noho ali ªi (ruling elite). He descended from HƒÅna la ªa nui. Lƒ´loa's mother, Waioloa, his grandmother, Ne ªula and great grandmother, La ªa kapu were of the  ªEwa ali ªi lines of Oahu. Liloa's father ruled Hawaii as ali ªi nui and upon his death elevated Lƒ´loa. Kiha had had four other sons, Kaunuamoa, Makaoku, Kepailiula and Hoolana, whose descendants are the Kaiakea family of Molokai, distant relatives of Abraham Fornander's daughter. In his book, David Malo described how Liloa originated the practice of moe ƒÅikane, the sexual relationship between males. The relationships had no social stigma and were accepted practice beginning with the alii and then copied by the other classes. Warriors engaged in the practice. The relationships cannot be defined as bisexuality. In many cases the men involved felt it an honor and responsibility to honor their hana lawelawe. = HƒÅkau = Just before his death, Liloa bestowed on HƒÅkau the succession as Chief, telling Umi that he was to serve as his \\"man\\" (Prime Minister) and that both were to respect the other and should either have issue with the other it would be for them to decide. At first a decent king, HƒÅkau soon became brutal. To avoid his brother's anger, 'Umi exiled himself to another district. HƒÅkau refused to help Nunu and Ka-hohe, his father's two favorite, ailing Kahuna who had requested food. This was considered highly insulting. The two were of the priestly class of the god Lono. They resented their treatment and plotted to see the kingdom in someone else's hand. HƒÅkau did not believe the priests to have any power and disrespected them as 'Umi was the spiritual authority This was a period in when no King could defy a Kahuna. Many had a royal bloodline, land and could leave their temples as warriors when needed, but could never relinquish their spiritual responsibilities. Through a messenger of Kaoleioku, of Waipunalei, the high-priest of the temple of Manini, at Koholalele the two priests contacted Umi's court. The two priests traveled to Waipunalei where they supported Umi's revolt. When HƒÅkau received news that his brother was preparing to war against him, he sent his main forces out to immediately prepare by seeking feathers to adorn their war regalia. After the men had left and HƒÅkau was undefended, Umi's men came forward with a deception that they were there with bundles of offerings for the king. When the bundles were dropped to the ground they were filled with rocks they used to stone HƒÅkau to death. Umi was given a number of royal tokens to prove he was the son of Liloa, including a Niho Palaoa. The lei (necklace) was made of braided human hair and whale bone. =  ªUmi-a-Lƒ´loa =  ªUmi-a-Lƒ´loa was a ruling ali ªi ai moku (district high chief of Hawai'i). He became chief after the death of his half brother HƒÅkau and was considered a just ruler, religious and the first to unite almost all of the Big Island. The legend of  ªUmi-a-Lƒ´loa is one of the most popular hero sagas in Hawaiian history.  ªUmi's wife was Princess Pi ªikea,Kamakau, Samuel Manaiakalani, Ka Nupepa Kuokoa (Newspaper). SEPTEMBER 23, 1865. \\"Ka Moolelo O Hawaii Nei\\". daughter of Pi ªilani. They had one son, Kumalae and one daughter, AihƒÅk≈çk≈ç. Liloa told Akahi that, if she were to have a male child, she should present the boy to him along with royal tokens he gave her as gifts, to prove her boy was the son of the king. Akahi hid the tokens from her husband and later gave birth to a son. At the age of 15 or 16, his stepfather was punishing the boy when his mother intervened and told the man not to touch him because the boy was his lord and chief. She uncovered the tokens to present to her husband to prove the high treason he would have committed. Akahi gave her son the royal malo and lei niho palaoa given to her by 'Umi's biological father. Only high chiefs wore these items. She sent 'Umi to Waipi ªo Valley to present himself to the king as his son. Liloa's palace was guarded and attended by several Kahuna. The entire enclosure was sacred. Entering without permission carried the death penalty. Umi entered the enclosure with attendants afraid to stop someone wearing the royal insignia and walked straight to Liloa's sleeping quarters, waking him there. When Liloa asked who he was, he said \\"It is I, 'Umi your son\\". He then placed the tokens at his father's feet and Liloa proclaimed him to be his son. After learning of 'Umi, HƒÅkau became upset. Liloa assured his first born that he would be king after his death and his brother would serve him. 'Umi was brought to court on an equal footing with HƒÅkau. Living within Liloa's court alongside his brother, Umi found great favor from his father, increasing HƒÅkau's dislike. In exile, 'Umi took wives and began building forces and followers. Chiefs began to believe him to be of the highest chiefly nature from signs they observed. He gave food to people and became known for caring for all. After HƒÅkau's death the other ali ªi of the island claimed their districts for themselves. 'Umi took the advice of the two priests by marrying many woman of high noble rank, including his half sister Kapukini and the daughter of the ruler of Hilo, where he had been given sanctuary during HƒÅkau's reign. Eventually Umi conquered the entire island. After unifying the island of Hawaii, 'Umi was faithful to those who had supported him, and allowed his three most faithful companions, and the two Kahuna who had aided him, to help him govern. =AikƒÅne= AikƒÅne relationships or (mostly male) homosexual or bisexual activity in the pre-colonial era was an accepted tradition. These relationships were accepted as part of ancient Hawaiian culture. Such sexual relationships may begin in the teens and continue thereafter, even though they have heterosexual partners. The Hawaiian aikƒÅne relationship was a part of Hawaiian noble life, including that of Kamehameha I. Some myths refer to women's desires and therefore some women may have been involved in aikƒÅne relationships as well. Lieutenant James King stated that \\"all the chiefs had them\\" and recounts a tale that James Cook was actually asked by one chief to leave Lt. King behind, considering such offer a great honor. Members of Cook's crew related tales of the tradition with great disdain. American adventurer and sailor John Ledyard commented in detail about the tradition. =Land division system= Land was divided up in strict adherence to the wishes of the Ali‚Äòi Nui. The traditional system of land has four hierarchical levels: *mokupuni (island) *moku (subdivisions of an island) *ahupua ªa (subdivision of moku) * ªili (two or three per ahupua ªa, but Kahoolawe for example had eight) Some oral history relates that  ªUmi a Lƒ´loa created the ahupua ªa system. The system exploited the fact that communities were already organized along stream systems. The community governance system of KƒÅnƒÅwai is attributed specifically to shared water usage. The Hawaiian agricultural system contained two major classes; irrigated and rain-fed (dryland) systems. Irrigated systems mainly supported taro (kalo) cultivation. Rain-fed systems were known as the mala. There they cultivated uala (sweet potatoes), yams, and dryland taro along with coconuts (niu), breadfruit ( ªulu), bananas (mai ªa) and sugarcane (ko). The kukui tree (Aleurites moluccanus) was sometimes used as a shade to protect the mala from the sun. Each crop was carefully placed in an area most suitable to its needs.Tracie Losch, Momi Kamahele, \\"Hawaii: Center of the Pacific\\" (Pearl City: University of Hawaii Leeward Community College, 2008), 241. Hawaiians domesticated dogs, chickens and pigs. They also grew personal gardens at home. Water was a very important part of Hawaiian life; it was used for fishing, bathing, drinking, and gardening, and for aquaculture systems in the rivers and at the shore's edge. Ahupua ªa most frequently consisted of a section of an island that went from the top of the local mountain to the shore, often following the boundary of a stream. Each ahupua ªa included a lowland mala and upland forested region.Losch, Tracie, and Momi Kamahele, \\"Hawaii: Center of the Pacific\\" (Pearl City: University of Hawaii Leeward Community College, 2008) Ahupua ªa varied in size depending on the economic means of the location and political divisions of the area. \\"As the native Hawaiians used the resources within their ahupua ªa, they practiced aloha (respect), laulima (cooperation) and malama (stewardship) which resulted in a desirable pono (balance)\\". The Hawaiians believed that the land, the sea, the clouds and all of nature had a certain interconnectedness which is why they used all of the resources around them to reach the desired balance in life. Sustainability was maintained by the konohiki and kahuna: priests, who restricted the fishing of certain species during specific seasons. They also regulated the gathering of plants. The term \\"ahupua ªa\\" is derived from the Hawaiian words ahu \\"heap, cairn\\" and pua ªa \\"pig\\". The boundary markers for ahupua ªa were traditionally heaps of stones used to hold offers to the island chief, which was often a pig. Each ahupua ªa was divided into smaller sections called  ªili and the  ªili were divided into kuleana. These were individual plots of land that were cultivated by commoners who paid labor taxes to the land overseer each week. These taxes went to support the chief. Two possible reasons for this subdivision have been offered: *travel: in many areas of Hawai ªi, it is easier to travel up- and downstream than from stream valley to stream valley. *economy: having all climate and economic exploitation zones in each land division ensured that each could be self-sufficient for a large portion of its needs. =Governance= The Kingdom was administered by an ali'i chief. Divisions were under the control of other smaller chiefs and managed by a steward. The headman of a land division or ahupua\`a is a konohiki. Mokus were ruled by an ali ªi  ªaimoku. Ahupua'as were run by a headman or chief called a Konohiki.[]  Konohiki  In Keelikolani vs Robinson, kononiki is defined as a Land Agent. In Territory vs Bishop Trust Co. LTD., when the agent was appointed by a chief, they were referred to as konohiki. The term could also be a designated area of land owned privately as compared to being owned by the government. A chief of lands retained life tenure on the land even after being discharged from the position, but a head man overseeing the same land had no such protection. Often ali'i and konohiki are treated synonymously. However, while most konohiki were ali'i nobility, not all ali'i were konohiki. The Hawaiian dictionary defines konohiki as a headman of a land division, but also to describe fishing rights. Kono means to entice or prompt. Hiki refers to something that can be done. The konohiki was a relative of the ali'i and oversaw the property, managing water rights, land distribution, agricultural use and any maintenance. The konohiki also ensured that the right amounts of gifts and tribute were properly made at the right times. As capitalism was incorporated into the kingdom the konohiki became tax collectors, landlords and fishery wardens. Contact HMS Resolution and HMS Discovery Captain James Cook led three separate voyages to chart unknown areas of the globe for the British Empire. On his third voyage he encountered Hawaii. He first sighted the islands on 18 January 1778. He anchored off the coast of Kauai and met with the local inhabitants to trade and obtain water and food for their continued voyage. On 2 February 1778, Cook continued on to the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. He returned to the Hawaii chain to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and Hawaii Island to trade. He anchored in Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. After departing Kealakekua, he returned in February 1779 after a ship's mast broke in bad weather. On the night of 13 February, while anchored in the bay, one of his only two longboats (lifeboats used to ferry to/from ship/shore) was stolen by the Hawaiians. In retaliation, Cook tried to kidnap the ali ªi nui of Hawaii Island, Kalani ª≈çpu ªu. On 14 February 1779 Cook confronted an angry crowd. Kana ªina approached Cook, who reacted by striking the royal attendant with the broad side of his sword. Kana ªina picked up the navigator and dropped him while another attendant, Nuaa killed Cook with a knife.Vanessa Collingridge, Captain Cook: The Life, Death and Legacy of History's Greatest Explorer (2003) p. 413  Kingdom of Hawaii  The Kingdom of Hawaii lasted from 1795 until its overthrow in 1893 with the fall of the House of Kalakaua. House of Kamehameha Kamehameha I, founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii The House of Kamehameha (Hale O Kamehameha), or the Kamehameha dynasty, was the reigning Royal Family of the Kingdom of Hawaii, beginning with its founding by Kamehameha I in 1795 and ending with the deaths of Kamehameha V in 1872 and William Charles Lunalilo in 1874. The origins of the House of Kamehameha can be traced to half brothers, Kalani ª≈çpu ªu and Ke≈çua. Kalani ª≈çpu ªu's father was Kalaninui ªƒ´amamao while Ke≈çua's father was Kalanike ªeaumoku, both sons of Keawe ªƒ´kekahiali ªiokamoku. They shared a common mother, Kamaka ªƒ´moku. Both brothers served Alapa ªinui, the ruling King of Hawaii Island. Hawaiian genealogy notes that Ke≈çua may not have been Kamehameha's biological father, and that Kahekili II might have been his biological father. Regardless, Kamehameha I's descent from Keawe remains intact through his mother, Keku ªiapoiwa II, a granddaughter of Keawe. Ke≈çua acknowledged him as his son and this relationship is recognized by official genealogies. The traditional mele chant of Keaka, wife of Alapainui, indicates that Kamehameha I was born in the month of ikuwƒÅ (winter) around November. Alapai gave the young Kamehameha to his wife Keaka and her sister HƒÅkau to care for after the ruler discovered the boy had lived. Samuel Kamakau, wrote, \\"It was during the time of the warfare among the chiefs of [the island of] Hawaii which followed the death of Keawe, chief over the whole island (Ke-awe- i-kekahi-ali ªi-o-ka-moku) that Kamehameha I was born\\". However, his general dating was challenged. Abraham Fornander wrote, \\"when Kamehameha died in 1819 he was past eighty years old. His birth would thus fall between 1736 and 1740, probably nearer the former than the latter\\". William De Witt Alexander lists the birth date as 1736. He was first named Paiea but took the name Kamehameha, meaning \\"The very lonely one\\" or \\"The one set alone\\". Kamehameha's uncle Kalani ª≈çpu ªu raised him after Ke≈çua's death. Kalani ª≈çpu ªu ruled Hawaii as did his grandfather Keawe. He had advisors and priests. When word reached the ruler that chiefs were planning to murder the boy, he told Kamehameha: The god K≈´-ka-ili-moku was left to Kamehameha I by his uncle Kalani ª≈çpu ªu After Kalani ª≈çpu ªu's death, Kƒ´wala ª≈ç took his father's place as first born and ruled the island while Kamehameha became the religious authority. Some chiefs supported Kamehameha and war soon broke out to overthrow Kƒ´wala ª≈ç. After multiple battles the king was killed and envoys sent for the last two brothers to meet with Kamehameha. Ke≈çua and Ka≈çleiok≈´ arrived in separate canoes. Ke≈çua came to shore first where a fight broke out and he and all aboard were killed. Before the same could happen to the second canoe, Kamehameha intervened. In 1793 Captain George Vancouver sailed from the United Kingdom and presented the Union Flag to Kamehameha, who was still in the process of uniting the islands into a single state; the Union Jack flew unofficially as the flag of Hawaii until 1816,https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Hawaii including during a brief spell of British rule after Kamehameha ceded Hawaii to Vancouver in 1794. By 1795, Kamehameha had conquered all but one of the main islands. For his first royal residence, the new King built the first western-style structure in the Hawaiian Islands, known as the \\"Brick Palace\\". The location became the seat of government for the Hawaiian Kingdom until 1845. The king commissioned the structure to be built at Keawa'iki point in Lahaina, Maui. Two ex-convicts from Australia's Botany Bay penal colony built the home. It was begun in 1798 and was completed after 4 years in 1802. The house was intended for Ka ªahumanu, but she refused to live in the structure and resided instead in an adjacent, traditional Hawaiian-styled home. Kamehameha I had many wives but held two in the highest regard. Ke≈çp≈´olani was the highest ranking ali ªi of her time and mother to his sons, Liholiho and Kauikeaouli. Ka ªahumanu was his favorite. Kamehameha I died in 1819, succeeded by Liholiho. Kamehameha II Kamehameha II in England with Queen and entourage After Kamehameha I's death, Liholiho left Kailua for a week and returned to be crowned king. At the lavish ceremony attended by commoners and nobles he approached the circle of chiefs, as Ka ªahumanu, the central figure in the group and Dowager Queen, said, \\"Hear me O Divine one, for I make known to you the will of your father. Behold these chiefs and the men of your father, and these your guns, and this your land, but you and I shall share the realm together\\". Liholiho agreed officially, which began a unique system of dual- government consisting of a King and co-ruler similar to a regent. Kamehameha II shared his rule with his stepmother, Ka ªahumanu. She defied Hawaiian kapu by dining with the young king, separating the sexes during meals, leading to the end of the Hawaiian religion. Kamehameha II died, along with his wife, Queen KamƒÅmalu in 1824 on a state visit to England, succumbing to measles. He was King for 5 years. The couple's remains were returned to Hawaii by Boki. Aboard the ship The Blond his wife Liliha and Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa were baptized as Christians. Ka ªahumanu also converted and became a powerful Christian influence on Hawaiian society until her death in 1832. Since the new king was only 12 years old, Ka ªahumanu was now senior ruler and named Boki as her Kuhina Nui. Boki left Hawaii on a trip to find sandalwood to cover a debt and was lost at sea. His wife, Liliha took the governorship of Maui and unsuccessfully attempted to whip up a revolt against Ka ªahumanu, who upon Boki's departure, had installed Kƒ´na ªu as a co-governor. Ka ªahumanu Ka ªahumanu with Charles Kana ªina Ka ªahumanu was born on Maui around 1777. Her parents were ali ªi of a lower-ranking line. She became Kamehameha's consort when she was fourteen. George Vancouver states: \\"[O]ne of the finest woman we had yet seen on any of the islands\\". To wed the young woman, Kamehameha had to consent to make her children his heirs to the Kingdom, although she had no issue. Before his death, Kamehameha selected Ka ªahumanu to rule along with his son. Ka ªahumanu had also adopted the boy. She had the highest political clout in the islands. A portrait artist remarked of her: \\"This Old Dame is the most proud, unbending Lady in the whole island. As the widow of [Kamehameha], she possesses unbound authority and respect, not any of which she is inclined to lay aside on any occasion whatsoever\\". She was one of Hawaii's most influential leaders. Sugar reciprocity Charles Reed Bishop, Minister of Foreign Affairs (Hawaii) Sugar became a major export from Hawaii soon after Cook's arrival. The first permanent plantation began in Kauai in 1835. William Hooper leased 980 acres of land from Kamehameha III and began growing sugarcane. Within thirty years plantations operated on the four main islands. Sugar completely altered Hawaii's economy. American influence in Hawaiian government began with U.S. plantation owners demanding a say in Kingdom politics. This was driven by missionary religion and sugar economics. Pressure from these plantation owners was felt by the King and chiefs as demands for land tenure. After the brief 1843 takeover by the British, Kamehameha III responded to the demands with the Great Mahele, distributing the lands to all Hawaiians as advocated by missionaries including Gerrit P. Judd. Kamehameha III also tried to modernize Hawaii's legal system by replacing indigenous traditions with Anglo-American common law. During the 1850s, the U.S. import tariff on sugar from Hawaii was much higher than the import tariffs Hawaiians were charging the U.S., and Kamehameha III sought reciprocity. The monarch wished to lower U.S. tariffs and make Hawaiian sugar competitive with other foreign suppliers. In 1854 Kamehameha III proposed a policy of reciprocity between the countries, but the proposal died in the U.S. Senate. U.S. control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of its west coast. The military was especially interested in Pu'uloa, Pearl Harbor. The sale of one harbor was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had risen to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, William Charles Lunalilo, was content to let Bishop run most business affairs, but the ceding of lands became unpopular with Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874. King David KalƒÅkaua Lunalilo left no heirs. The legislature was empowered by the constitution to elect the monarch in these instances and chose David KalƒÅkaua as Lunalilo's successor. The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy. KalƒÅkaua was concerned that this would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to violating the traditions of the Hawaiian people, who believed that the land ('ƒÄina) was fertile, sacred and not for sale. From 1874 through 1875, KalƒÅkaua made a state visit to Washington DC to gather support for a new treaty. Congress agreed to the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 for seven years in exchange for Ford Island. After the treaty, sugar production expanded from 12,000 acres to 125,000 acres in 1891. At the end of the seven-year term, the United States showed little interest in renewal. Rebellion of 1887 and the Bayonet Constitution On January 20, 1887, the United States began leasing Pearl Harbor. Shortly afterwards, a group of mostly non-Hawaiians calling themselves the Hawaiian Patriotic League began the Rebellion of 1887. They drafted their own constitution on July 6, 1887. The new constitution was written by Lorrin Thurston, the Hawaiian Minister of the Interior who used the Hawaiian militia to threaten KalƒÅkaua. KalƒÅkaua was forced to dismiss his cabinet ministers and sign a new constitution that greatly lessened his power. It would become known as the \\"Bayonet Constitution\\" due to the threat of force. Lorrin Thurston, Minister of the Interior (Hawaii) Grover Cleveland was president at the time, and his secretary of state Thomas F. Bayard sent written instructions to the American minister George W. Merrill that in the event of another revolution in Hawaii, it was a priority to protect American commerce, lives and property. Bayard specified, \\"the assistance of the officers of our Government vessels, if found necessary, will therefore be promptly afforded to promote the reign of law and respect for orderly government in Hawaii.\\" In July 1889, there was a small scale rebellion, and Minister Merrill landed Marines to protect Americans; the State Department explicitly approved his action. Merrill's replacement, minister John L. Stevens, read those official instructions, and followed them in his controversial actions of 1893.Charles S. Campbell, The Transformation of American Foreign Relations: 1865‚Äì1900 (1976), pp 178-79, Although KalƒÅkaua's signature alone had no legal power, the new constitution allowed the monarch to appoint cabinet ministers, but stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature. Eligibility to vote for the House of Nobles was altered, requiring that both candidates and voters own property valued three thousand dollars or more, or have an annual income of six hundred dollars or more. This disenfranchised two thirds of native Hawaiians and other ethnic groups who had previously been eligible to vote. This constitution benefited the foreign plantation owners. With the legislature now responsible for naturalizing aliens, Americans and Europeans could retain their home country citizenship and vote as citizens of the kingdom. Along with voting privileges, Americans could hold office and still retain their American citizenship, something not afforded in any other nation and even allowed Americans to vote without becoming naturalized. Asian immigrants were no longer able to acquire citizenship or vote. Wilcox Rebellion of 1888  ªIolani Barracks, 2007 The Wilcox Rebellion of 1888 was a plot to overthrow King David KalƒÅkaua and replace him with his sister in a coup d'√©tat. This was in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king under the 1887 constitution. KalƒÅkaua's sister, Princess Liliuokalani and wife, Queen Kapiolani returned from Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee immediately after news reached them in Great Britain. KalƒÅkaua's distant cousin, a native Hawaiian officer and veteran of the Italian military, Robert William Wilcox returned to Hawaii at about the same time as Liliuokalani in October 1887 when the funding for his study program stopped. Wilcox, Charles B. Wilson, Princess Liliuokalani, and Sam Nowlein plotted to overthrow King KalƒÅkaua and replace him with Liliuokalani. 300 Hawaiian conspirators hid in Iolani Barracks and an alliance was formed with the Royal Guard, but the plot was accidentally discovered in January 1888, less than 48 hours before the revolt. No one was prosecuted, but Wilcox was exiled. On February 11, 1888 Wilcox left Hawaii for San Francisco, intending to return to Italy with his wife. Princess Liliuokalani was offered the throne several times by the Missionary Party who had forced the Bayonet Constitution on her brother, but she believed she would become a powerless figurehead like her brother and rejected the offers. In January 1891, KalƒÅkaua traveled to San Francisco for his health, staying at the Palace Hotel. He died there on January 20. She then ascended the throne. Queen Liliuokalani called her brother's reign \\"a golden age materially for Hawaii\\". Queen Liliuokalani  Liliuokalani's attempt to re-write Constitution  Liliuokalani assumed the throne in the middle of an economic crisis. The McKinley Act had crippled the Hawaiian sugar industry by removing the duties on sugar imports from other countries into the US, eliminating the previous Hawaiian advantage due to the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. Many Hawaii businesses and citizens lost revenue; in response Liliuokalani proposed a lottery system to raise money for her government. Controversially, opium licensing was proposed. Her ministers and closest friends were all opposed to this plan; they unsuccessfully tried to dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to be used against her in the brewing constitutional crisis. Liliuokalani's chief desire was to restore power to the monarch by abrogating the 1887 Bayonet Constitution and promulgating a new one.Russ, The Hawaiian Revolution, p. 67: \\"She ... defended her act[ions] by showing that, out of a possible 9,500 native voters in 1892, 6,500 asked for a new Constitution.\\" The 1893 Constitution would have extended suffrage by reducing some property requirements. It would have disenfranchised many non-citizen Europeans and Americans. The Queen toured several islands on horseback, talking to the people about her ideas and receiving overwhelming support, including a lengthy petition in support of a new constitution. However, when the Queen informed her cabinet of her plans, they withheld their support, uncomfortable with what they expected her opponent's likely response to be.Daws, Shoal of Time, p271: The Queen's new cabinet \\"had been in office less than a week, and whatever they thought about the need for a new constitution... they knew enough about the temper of the queen's opponents to realize that they would endure the chance to challenge her, and no minister of the crown could look forward... to that confrontation.\\" Liliuokalani's attempt to promulgate a new constitution on January 14, 1893, was the precipitating event leading to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii three days later. The conspirators' stated goals were to depose the queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the U.S. From Kuykendall, p. 587-588: \\"W.D. Alexander (History of Later Years of the Hawaiian Monarchy and the Revolution of 1893, p. 37) gives the following as the wording of Thurston's motion [to launch the coup]: 'That preliminary steps be taken at once to form and declare a Provisional Government with a view to annexation to the United States.' Thurston later wrote that his motion was 'substantially as follows: \\"I move that it is the sense of this meeting that the solution of the present situation is annexation to the United States.\\"'(Memoirs, p. 250) Lt. Lucien Young (The Boston at Hawaii, p. 175) gives the following version of the motion: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that in view of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs, the proper course to pursue is to abolish the monarchy and apply for annexation to the United States.'\\" The conspirators were five American, one English and one German national. Overthrow The overthrow was led by Thurston, who was the grandson of American missionaries and derived his support primarily from the American and European business class and other supporters of the Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Most of the leaders of the Committee of Safety that deposed the queen were American and European citizens who were Kingdom subjects. They included legislators, government officers and a Supreme Court Justice of the Hawaiian Kingdom. On January 16, the Marshal of the Kingdom, Charles B. Wilson was tipped off by detectives of the planned coup. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13 Council members and put the Kingdom under martial law. Because the members had strong political ties with U.S. Government Minister John L. Stevens, the requests were repeatedly denied by Attorney General Arthur P. Peterson and the Queen's cabinet, fearing if approved, the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston, Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and Captain of the Royal Household Guard Samuel Nowlein rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the Queen. The overthrow began on January 17, 1893. A policeman was shot and wounded while trying to stop a wagon carrying weapons to the Honolulu Rifles, the paramilitary wing of the Committee of Safety. The Committee feared the shooting would bring government forces to rout the conspirators and stop the coup before it could begin. The Committee of Safety initiated the overthrow by organizing the Honolulu Rifles made of about 1,500 armed local (non-native) men. The Rifles garrisoned Ali'iolani Hale across the street from  ªIolani Palace and waited for the Queen's response. USS Boston John L. Stevens, an American diplomat, conspired to overthrow the Kingdom of Hawaii As these events were unfolding, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu.The Morgan Report, p808-809, \\"At the request of many citizens, whose wives and families were helpless and in terror of an expected uprising of the mob, which would burn and destroy, a request was made and signed by all of the committee, addressed to Minister Stevens, that troops might be landed to protect houses and private property. United States military support  The coup efforts were supported by U.S. Government Minister John L. Stevens. The coup left the queen under house arrest at Iolani Palace. The Kingdom briefly became the Republic of Hawaii, before annexation by the United States in 1898. Advised about supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and propertyKinzer, S. (2006) America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq. p. 30. [Minister Stevens] \\"certainly overstepped his authority when he brought troops ashore, especially since he knew that the 'general alarm and terror' of which the Committee of Safety had complained was a fiction.\\" by the Committee of Safety, Stevens summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the USS Boston and two companies of U.S. sailors to take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16, 1893. 162 armed sailors and Marines aboard the USS Boston in Honolulu Harbor came ashore under orders of neutrality. The sailors and Marines did not enter the Palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence intimidated royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, \\"the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.\\"  United States territory = Annexation  Political cartoon of 1898 In March 1897, William McKinley, a Republican expansionist, succeeded Democrat Grover Cleveland as U.S. President. He prepared a treaty of annexation but it lacked the needed 2/3 majority in the Senate given Democratic opposition. A joint resolution, which does not have the power to annex, written by Democratic Congressman Francis G. Newlands to annex Hawaii passed both the House and Senate; it needed only majority support. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War had broken out and many leaders wanted control of Pearl Harbor to help the United States to become a Pacific power and protect the West Coast. In 1897 Japan sent warships to Hawaii to oppose annexation. The possibility of invasion and annexation by Japan made the decision even more urgent, especially since the islands' fourth population was Japanese who were largely sympathetic to their country's goal in doing so. McKinley signed the Newlands Resolution annexing Hawaii on July 7, 1898, creating the Territory of Hawaii. On 22 February 1900 the Hawaiian Organic Act established a territorial government. Annexation opponents held that this was illegal, claiming the Queen was the only legitimate ruler. McKinley appointed Sanford B. Dole as territorial governor. The territorial legislature convened for the first time on February 20, 1901. Hawaiians formed the Hawaiian Independent Party, under the leadership of Robert Wilcox, Hawaii's first congressional delegate.William Adam Russ, The Hawaiian Republic (1894‚Äì98): and its struggle to win annexation (Susquehanna U Press, 1992).  Plantations  Sugarcane plantations in Hawaii expanded during the territorial period. Some companies diversified and came to dominate related industries including transportation, banking and real estate. Economic and political power was concentrated in what were known as the \\"Big Five\\".  World War II  USS Arizona during the attack on Pearl Harbor = Attack on Pearl Harbor = Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941 by the Imperial Japanese Navy, killing almost 2,500 people and sinking the main American battleship fleet. Fortuitously, the four Pacific aircraft carriers were not in port and escaped damage. Hawaii was put under martial law until 1945. Unlike the West Coast of the United States in which 100,000 ethnic Japanese citizens were interned, the Japanese American population in Hawaii completely avoided such similar fate, though hundreds of pro-Japan leaders were arrested. Pearl Harbor was the U.S.' main forward base for the Pacific War. The Japanese tried to invade in summer 1942 but were defeated at the Battle of Midway. Hundreds of thousands of American soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen passed through on their way to the fighting.DeSoto Brown, and Anne Ellett, Hawaii goes to war: life in Hawaii from Pearl Harbor to peace (1989). Many Hawaiians served in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a U.S. Army infantry regiment. The regiment was composed almost entirely of American soldiers of Japanese ancestry. The regiment fought primarily in Italy, southern France and Germany. The 442nd Regiment was the most decorated unit for its size and length of service in American history. Its 4,000 members had to be replaced nearly 2.5 times due to casualties. In total, about 14,000 men served, earning 9,486 Purple Hearts. The unit was awarded eight Presidential Unit Citations (five in one month). Twenty-one of its members, including Hawaii U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, were awarded Medals of Honor. Its motto was \\"Go for Broke\\".  Democratic Party  In 1954 a series of non-violent industry-wide strikes, protests and other civil disobedience transpired. In the territorial elections of 1954 the reign of the Hawaii Republican Party in the legislature came to an abrupt end, replaced by the Democratic Party of Hawaii. Democrats lobbied for statehood and held the governorship from 1962 to 2002. The events also unionized the labor force, hastening the plantations' decline.  Statehood  All islands voted at least 93% in favor of statehood in 1959 President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Hawaii Admission Act on March 18, 1959 which allowed for Hawaiian statehood. After a popular referendum in which over 93% voted in favor of statehood, Hawaii was admitted as the 50th state on August 21, 1959.  Annexation legacy  For many Native Hawaiians, the manner in which Hawaii became a U.S. territory was illegal. Hawaii Territory governors and judges were direct political appointees of the U.S. President. Native Hawaiians created the Home Rule Party to seek greater self-government. Hawaii was subject to cultural and societal repression during the territorial period and the first decade of statehood. The 1960s Hawaiian Renaissance led to renewed interest in the Hawaiian language, culture and identity. With the support of Hawaii Senators Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, Congress passed a joint resolution called the \\"Apology Resolution\\" (US Public Law 103-150). It was signed by President Bill Clinton on November 23, 1993. This resolution apologized \\"to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893... and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination.\\" The implications of this resolution have been extensively debated. In 2000, Akaka proposed what was called the Akaka Bill to extend federal recognition to those of Native Hawaiian ancestry as a sovereign group similar to Native American tribes. The bill did not pass before his retirement.

It would be later settled by French Acadians that used these waterways to reach the capital of Port-Royal and farming. In the late 1750s the region was settled by New England Planters, and Loyalists to replace the ousted French Acadians. The first four families to be granted land there would later comprise the town of Middleton. They included families with names like Gates and Marshall and Richardson. Col. Philip Richardson received six lots of two hundred and fifty acres each, which ran from the Annapolis River half way to the Mountain to the north, while his neighbour to the west, Anthony Marshall, got two 424-acre lots which ran all the way to the top of the mountain. A Neily family, from Ireland via Ardoise in Hants County, got the next two lots in what would be Lower Middleton, while Benjamin Chesley got the last two lots, next to the town limits.Mddleton Anniversary Committee.

'Resolved, first, that the locality hitherto known as Wilmot Corner, or Fowler's Corner, be henceforth called by the name of Middleton'. This name was chosen by its citizens and selected because of its location midway between Halifax and Yarmouth. The town was incorporated in 1909.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Middleton recorded a population of 1,832 living in 892 of its 995 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 1,749. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.  Economy  The re-opening of the Torbrook Iron Mines and the second railway line in 1889 sparked a decade of rapid growth and development. With many industries supporting and connected to the agriculture and manufacturing industry. Today the town's economy is also heavily influenced by its proximity to the air force base CFB Greenwood in nearby Kings County. Board of Trade The early records of the Board of Trade were lost in the Great Fire of 1911 but from the reports of its initial activities, the board was formed out of a need to vigorously pursue the issues of the day which affected business and industry - railway schedules and rates, street lighting and a variety of matters involving the municipal government of the day. Two merchants, Harry Reed and Gorden Gross, formed the Board, with newspaper publisher Fred Cox as their secretary-treasurer. Business *A.W. Allen & Son - Established in 1901. The Allen Mills and factories were at their peak of production between two world wars. The company owns about 2000 acres of woodland on the south mountain which was logged in the winter. Fires were the bane of the mill, with one serious fire in autumn 1939 destroying the new two- storey factory and another in 1945. The mill was replaced by the present day building.Middleton Anniversary Committee. Middleton: 1909-1984. Friesen Printers & Publishing, 1984. p. 74 *McKenzie Creamery - Established in 1923 - J.D.

Middleton is the northern terminus of Trunk 10 which connects the town with Bridgewater and Lunenburg on the South Shore. The town was located on the Dominion Atlantic Railway's (DAR) mainline from Halifax to Yarmouth and was also served by CN Rail's line from Bridgewater to Bridgetown (and on to Victoria Beach). CN Rail abandoned its line through Middleton in 1982; it had formerly been the Nova Scotia Central Railway (NSCR). The DAR abandoned its mainline through the town in March 1990, following the January 15, 1990, abandonment of the Evangeline passenger train service by Via Rail. The abandoned DAR and CN railway lines are currently owned by the Government of Nova Scotia and used as recreational trails. The old railway station is now a railway museum operated by the Futureview TREA.

The provincial government is funding construction of a new 50-bed nursing home in the town which is opened in late 2009. Middleton is home to the Annapolis Valley MacDonald Museum, which is housed in the original Macdonald Consolidated School. This school, founded in 1903, was the first consolidated school in Canada, established with a grant from the Macdonald Tobacco Company of Montreal. The museum has many travelling exhibits, and is the home of the Nova Scotia Museum Clock collection.

It is the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila passing through 6 of the capital region's 17 local government units, namely, from north to south, Caloocan, Quezon City, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati and Pasay. Named after academic Epifanio de los Santos, the road links the North Luzon Expressway at the Balintawak Interchange in the north to the South Luzon Expressway at the Magallanes Interchange in the south, as well as the major financial districts of Makati Central Business District, Ortigas Center and Araneta Center. It is the longest and the most congested highway in the metropolis, stretching some . Structure The avenue is a component of Circumferential Road 4 (C-4) of Manila's arterial road network, National Route 1 (N1) of the Philippine highway network and Asian Highway 26 (AH26) of the Asian highway network. The locations around the avenue were marked with great economic and industrial growth, proven by the fact that all but 2 industrial centers in the Metropolis are directly accessible from the thoroughfare. The decent economic growth of the areas around the avenue adds a significant volume of traffic on the avenue, and in recent estimates, and an average of 2.34 million vehicles go through it every day. The avenue is a divided carriageway, often consisting of 12 lanes, 6 in either direction, with the elevated railroads Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3 and Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 often serving as its median. Although it is not an expressway, traffic rules and speed limits are strictly implemented to the vehicles that pass along it. It is operated by the Metro Manila Development Authority and is maintained and constantly being repaired by the Department of Public Works and Highways.  Route description  A street sign for EDSA used in Pasay. The northern terminus of EDSA at the Bonifacio Monument in Caloocan. The intersection of EDSA and Taft Avenue. EDSA starts from the Bonifacio Monument (Monumento) Roundabout in Gracepark, Caloocan, adjacent to the Apolonio Samson Road, the western side of the C-4 Road. The roundabout is also the marker of the 1896 Revolution by Andres Bonifacio. The 1.7 kilometers of the road are in Caloocan. The Avenue will then enter Quezon City through the Balintawak District, after an intersection with the North Luzon Expressway in the Balintawak Interchange. EDSA crosses much of the northern part of Quezon City, passing through the Project 6 and Project 7 districts. It sharply curves southwards after crossing the North Avenue-West Avenue Intersection in the Triangle Business Park. On the north side of EDSA is the SM City North EDSA. In front of it is the TriNoma mall and the Eton Centris or Centris Walk. ABS- CBN Broadcasting Center and its transmitter can be easily seen from EDSA and continues southwards, slightly turning westwards slowly until it leaves the Triangle Park after crossing the East Avenue-Timog Avenue Intersection, where the GMA Network Center is located. It continues through the district of Cubao, entering the Araneta Center after crossing the Aurora Boulevard Tunnel. In Cubao, several malls, infrastructure and offices are located, most notably the Smart Araneta Coliseum, the biggest coliseum in Southeast Asia. The Avenue curves southwards and enters the Santolan and Socorro districts, where the twin military bases of Camp Rafael Crame and Camp Aguinaldo, are located. The Greenhills Shopping Center and the Eastwood City are also located nearby. EDSA then continues on its route and serves as the boundary of the cities of San Juan and Quezon City. The People Power Monument can be seen on the north side of EDSA in the White Plains Avenue junction. After the 11 kilometers of EDSA in Quezon City, the Avenue will eventually leave the city and enter the City of Mandaluyong. EDSA enters Mandaluyong after crossing the borders of the Ortigas Center. In the Ortigas Center, some notable buildings around the area are the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration building, Robinsons Galleria, SM Megamall, Forum Robinsons (Robinsons Pioneer), and the bronze EDSA Shrine, a memorial church to the 1986 Revolution. It then curves smoothly westwards after it crosses the Pioneer Street, and crosses the Pasig River via the Guadalupe Bridge and leaving the city of Mandaluyong. It enters the city of Makati after crossing the Pasig River, passing through the districts of Guadalupe, Comembo and Magallanes. In Guadalupe, EDSA provides access to the Rockwell Center, a major mixed-use business park in Makati. The highway also provides quick access to the city of Taguig and the Bonifacio Global City nearby. After crossing Buendia Avenue, the highway enters the Ayala Center, an important commercial district in the Philippines, where the Greenbelt and Glorietta shopping centers are located. The road then curves eastwards, continues on a straight route to the city of Pasay, and passing the South Luzon Expressway through Magallanes Interchange. EDSA enters Pasay shortly after crossing SLEX in Makati. In Pasay, the highway provides access to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport via a flyover. EDSA will pass to Pasay Rotonda and continues on a straight route until it crosses to Roxas Boulevard. After crossing Roxas Boulevard, it enters to Bay City reclamation area, where the large SM Mall of Asia is located. EDSA's terminus is at a rotunda in front of the Globe of the SM Mall of Asia. Traffic management The lead agency that manages the flow of traffic along EDSA is the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), a government agency under the Office of the President of the Philippines and is advised by the Metro Manila Mayors League. One of the MMDA's traffic management schemes that is in effect on EDSA, among other major thoroughfares in the metropolis, is the Uniform Vehicular Volume Reduction Program. Many have observed that the cause of many traffic jams on EDSA is its change from being a highway to an avenue. This resulted the erection of erring establishment, buses and jeepneys. Subsequently, buses have been the target of other traffic management programs, like the MMDA's Organized Bus Route Program. The MMDA is strictly implementing also the Motorcycle and Bus laning in EDSA, making it the second highway in the Philippines ever to have such traffic rule to be enforced, after Commonwealth Avenue. The average speed of vehicles in EDSA is . From January 18, 2016, strict implementation on bus lanes started on the Shaw-Guadalupe segment, where plastic barriers are placed and prohibited entry of private vehicles and taxis on the bus lanes except when turning to EDSA's side streets. Despite the plastic barrier, many private vehicles still enter the lanes. History Epifanio de los Santos y Crist√≥bal, the Filipino historian and jurist after whom EDSA was named. Construction of what was then called the North‚ÄìSouth Circumferential Road began in the 1930s under President Manuel L. Quezon. The construction team was led by engineers Florencio Moreno and Osmundo Monsod. The road, starting from the North Diversion Road (today the North Luzon Expressway) and ending at the current Magallanes Interchange with the South Luzon Expressway, was finished in 1940 shortly before the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent Japanese Occupation. After the independence of the Philippines from the United States in 1946, the road was renamed Avenida 19 de Junio (June 19 Avenue), after the birth date of national hero Jos√© Rizal. In the 1950s, the avenue was renamed Highway 54, because of the common misconception on that time that the avenue is 54 km long. Rizalists wanted the avenue's name to remain 19 de Junio, while President Ramon Magsaysay wanted the avenue named after Rizal. Residents of Rizal Province (to which most parts of Metro Manila belonged until the 1970s) wanted the avenue to be named after a Rizale√±o: the historian, jurist and scholar named Epifanio de los Santos y Crist√≥bal. The Philippine Historical Committee (now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines), the Philippine Historical Association, the Philippine Library Association, Association of University and College Professors, the Philippine China Cultural Association, and the Philippine National Historical Society, led by fellow Rizale√±os Eulogio Rodr√≠guez, Sr. and Juan Sumulong, supported the renaming of Highway 54 to Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. On April 7, 1959, De los Santos' birthday, Republic Act No. 2140 was passed, renaming the avenue to honor him.Chan Robles Virtual Law Library - REPUBLIC ACT NO. 2140 - AN ACT CHANGING THE NAME OF HIGHWAY 54 IN THE PROVINCE OF RIZAL TO EPIFANIO DE LOS SANTOS AVENUE IN HONOR OF DON EPIFANIO DE LOS SANTOS, A FILIPINO SCHOLAR, JURIST AND HISTORIAN Rapid urbanization in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly after the annexation of several Rizal towns to the newly established National Capital Region, marked the growth of the industrial centers along the road, and several other roads connected to the avenue, such as Ayala Avenue and McKinley Road in Makati. During the rule of President Ferdinand Marcos, traffic jams along the avenue started to build up. Several interchanges were constructed to relieve congestion, including the Balintawak and Magallanes Interchanges at opposite ends of the avenue. Later, with the implementation of the Metro Manila Arterial Road System in 1965, in order to complete the Circumferential Road 4 system, EDSA was extended to Taft Avenue from the South Luzon Expressway (the extension was called F. Rein Avenue), and further to Roxas Boulevard (the extension was called P. Lovina Avenue). EDSA was also extended from its original Balintawak terminus to Apolonio Samson Road at the roundabout containing the Bonifacio Monument in Caloocan, completing the Circumferential Road 4 system. Until the mid-1980s, many parts of the highway still overlooked vast grassland and open fields. The EDSA Revolution By 1986, political opposition to the 20-year dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos mounted. In late February, high-ranking military officers including Defence Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and General Fidel Ramos, defected from the Marcos government and seized Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo, two military bases located across each other midway along EDSA. This triggered three days of peaceful demonstrations that became the People Power Revolution. The majority of protesters were gathered at the gates of the two bases, along a stretch of EDSA between the commercial districts of Cubao in Quezon City and Ortigas Center in Mandaluyong. Over two million Filipino civilians, along with political, military, and religious groups led by Archbishop of Manila Cardinal Jaime Sin, succeeded in toppling President Marcos. Corazon Aquino, the widow of assassinated opposition senator Benigno Aquino Jr., was installed as president on the morning of February 25; by midnight, Marcos had escaped Malaca√±ang Palace with his family, and was flying to exile in Hawaii. Monuments Several landmarks commemorate historical events that occurred along the avenue. At the intersection of EDSA and Ortigas Avenue is EDSA Shrine, a Catholic church capped by a bronze statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Peace. The shrine is dedicated to this Marian title in memory of the pious folk belief that in the 1986 Revolution, the Virgin Mary personally shielded the protesters ‚Äì many of whom were peacefully praying and singing ‚Äì as they faced government troops, tanks, and aircraft. The People Power Monument (), consisting of a giant statue and esplanade, sits at the corner of EDSA and White Plains Avenue. Sculpted by Eduardo Castrillo and unveiled in 1993, the central sculpture depicts protesters standing upon a circular podium, all surrounding a woman (representing In√°ng Bayan or the Motherland), reaching up to the heavens with her outstretched hands and broken shackles. A Philippine flag rises behind her, while a statue of Ninoy Aquino and an eternal flame stand on either side at its base. A huge, limestone-faced wall with grooves for ribbons in the national colors forms a backdrop to the scene. The surrounding pavement contains a row of flagstaffs, and is the center for protests and ceremonies held on the Revolution's anniversary of February 25. Recent history EDSA-Roosevelt (Mu√±oz) in 2007, before the completion of the LRT-1 extension. EDSA-Cubao heading northbound towards Kamuning. After the People Power Revolution, the highway was commonly referred to as EDSA, and it was connected to its southern extensions. In 1997, construction began on the Manila Metro Rail Transit System, which runs the length of EDSA from North Avenue to Taft Avenue. It was opened under Joseph Estrada, the thirteenth President of the Philippines.GMA Launches transit system , Philippine Star, July 15, 2003NUMBER OF MOTOR VEHICLES REGISTERED: Comparative, JAN.- DEC. 2003, 2004, 2005 , Land Transportation Office, January 23, 2006 The Second EDSA Revolution, which also took place along the avenue, resulted in the peaceful ouster of President Estrada following his impeachment trial. He was succeeded by his Vice-President, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. She was sworn in on the terrace of EDSA Shrine by then-Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. at noon on January 20, 2001, several hours before Estrada and his family fled Malaca√±ang Palace. The EDSA III, which also took place along the avenue from April 25 to May 1 of the same year, resulted in violence when the supporters of former President Estrada attempted to storm the presidential palace and the military and police were ordered to use their arms to drive them back. Arroyo declared a state of rebellion because of the violence and prominent political personalities affiliated with Estrada were charged and arrested. In 2006, the avenue was further extended from Roxas Boulevard to the SM Mall of Asia, where it now ends at the Mall of Asia Globe and roundabout. That same year the avenue was badly damaged in September, when Typhoon Milenyo hit Manila. In 2010, the Manila LRT Line 1 (LRT-1) of the Manila Light Rail Transit System was extended from Monumento to Roosevelt, ultimately transversing EDSA to end at the site of the current North Avenue MRT Station. Mass rally against the Reproductive Health Bill held at the Ortigas Interchange In August 2012, prior to the Congressional hearing of the controversial Reproductive Health Bill, the Catholic Church assembled a mass rally on EDSA to oppose the proposition. On September 11, 2013, a prayer vigil dubbed as EDSA Tayo was held at the EDSA Shrine, where around 500‚Äì700 people were gathered to called for the abolition of the Priority Development Assistance Fund. On February 25, 2015, thousands of people from various socio- civic, political and religious groups held a demonstration along EDSA, demanding that President Benigno Aquino III stand down. The protests were confined to an area near the Santolan intersection because of police prevented crowds from reaching the People Power Monument. On August 27‚Äì31 of the same year, Iglesia ni Cristo adherents staged demonstrations along EDSA near SM Megamall. They called on then-Justice Secretary Leila De Lima to focus on issues such as the SAF 44 Incident instead of a case filed by former INC minister Isaias Samson, Jr., against Church leaders. This, they claimed, was intervention that violated the constitutional provision separating church and state. On September 9, 2015, the Philippine National Police (PNP) deployed the Highway Patrol Group to support MMDA traffic constables easing traffic on congested segments of EDSA. On November 30, 2016, the largest anti-Marcos protest in the 21st century were conducted in the People Power Monument, various urban cities and rural provinces in the country following the controversial burial of Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. On November 5, 2017, called this event as Lord, Heal Our Land, led by Lingayen- Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas, about thousands of opponents of Duterte attend a mass held in EDSA shrine. Tindig Pilipinas key people, Then-senator Antonio Trillanes and Then-representative Gary Alejano also attended the event. On February 22, 2018, Groups gathered at People Power Monument to hold a prayer vigil late at night, and showing the opposition to the proposed Charter change. On February 22, 2020, Demonstrators gathered at the People Power Monument to protest the \\"allowing the China to breach the Philippine sovereignty\\" and calling to President Rodrigo Duterte to resign from the office. Intersections Notes Future developments=Proposed interchanges An overpass over the North Avenue-West Avenue Intersection and Mindanao Avenue Junction in the Triangle Park and a Flyover over Congressional Avenue and Roosevelt Avenue Intersection in Mu√±oz are already approved and may start construction in 2013. As of 2020, the project is currently on hold. Proposed renaming In 2011, Bohol Representative Rene Lopez Relampagos filed House Bill (HB) No. 5422, proposing to rename Epifanio de los Santos Avenue as \\"Corazon Aquino Avenue.\\" The proposal is currently pending in the Philippine House of Representatives before the House Committee on Public Works and Highways. According to Relampagos, the idea to rename EDSA after Aquino (who led the 1986 People Power) was conceptualized in the aftermath of her death. Construction of EDSA-Taft flyover On April 2, 2013, then President Benigno Aquino III gave the green light for the construction of a flyover at the perennially traffic-choked corner of EDSA and Taft Avenue in Metro Manila.http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/383789/aquino-approves-construction- of-edsa-taft-flyover The project is estimated to cost , with the flyover extending to about each side and it will take one and a half years to complete the project. Barrier-separated bus lanes After stricter implementation of bus lanes and barrier separation through plastic barriers, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will start to replace the orange barriers with a concrete permanent barrier used to separate the bus lanes from private vehicle lanes. Proposed road pricing scheme With support from Singapore, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority proposed the implementation of road pricing, based on the Electronic Road Pricing scheme on Singapore, on EDSA to alleviate traffic congestion, along with providing alternate routes and opening some gated community roads. Implementation is set for 2018, but Rene Santiago, a transport engineer and planner, criticized the proposal because it may only worsen congestion, along with the numerous intersections and side streets along EDSA. Bus Rapid Transit (EDSA Busway) The Department of Transportation proposed to have at least two lines of the Metro Manila Bus Rapid Transit System in 2017. EDSA's proposed BRT line will be named \\"Line 2: Central Corridor\\". The line will have of segregated busways covering the length of the road. The agency planned to scrap the project by June 2018. However, this appeal was rejected and the Line 1 which will be built on Quezon Avenue, which passes EDSA, was later approved by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on November 2. In 2019, Senator Win Gatchalian called for the approval of the BRT system as an alternate to the PNR Metro Commuter Line. Last March 16, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) imposed a community quarantine or lockdown, which halted almost all public and private transportations plying in EDSA. This paved way for the immediate construction of the bus rapid transit (BRT) system called EDSA Busway. The interim operations of the BRT system began on July 1, 2020. Intended to be largely served by bus stops along median lanes, some stops are temporarily served by stations on the curbside. The system runs on a dedicated bus lane which is separated by concreted barriers and steel fences. In popular culture EDSA is featured in the film The Bourne Legacy. Portions of the road from Magallanes Interchange to Taft Avenue were featured in a car chase wherein Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, jumps from the Taft Avenue footbridge to a plying bus. Also, every February 25, the day of the EDSA People Power Revolution, the statues in the People Power Monument in the White Plains junction were repainted and yellow flags were placed on their hands, in order to commemorate the successful revolution. EDSA is also continuously being used in political campaigns by several politicians, particularly those who had been involved in the EDSA Revolution such as Joseph Estrada and Benigno Aquino III.

Edmonds first became known as a disc jockey on Radio Luxembourg before moving to BBC Radio 1 in the UK. He has presented radio shows and light-entertainment television programmes across 50 years, originally working for the BBC, later Sky UK and Channel 4. His shows include Multi-Coloured Swap Shop, Top of the Pops, Top Gear, The Late Late Breakfast Show and Telly Addicts. From 2005 to 2016, he presented almost 3,000 episodes of the Channel 4 game show Deal or No Deal. Early life and radio career The son of Dudley Edmonds, a headmaster who worked in Hainault, London, and Lydia Edmonds, an art teacher, Edmonds attended Glade Primary School in Clayhall and Brentwood School in Brentwood, Essex.Rachel Cooke, The Observer, Noel Edmonds talks to Rachel Cooke, 29 January 2006 He was offered a place at the University of Surrey but turned it down in favour of a job as a newsreader on Radio Luxembourg, which was offered to him in 1968 after he sent tapes to offshore radio stations. In 1969, Edmonds moved to BBC Radio 1, where he began by recording trailers for broadcasts and filling in for absent DJs, such as Kenny Everett. In April 1970, he began his own two-hour Saturday- afternoon programme, broadcasting from 1pm to 3pm, before replacing Everett on Saturday mornings from 10am to 12noon in July that year. In October 1971, he was moved to a Sunday-morning slot from 10am to 12noon before being promoted to host The Radio 1 Breakfast Show from Monday 4 June 1973 to Friday 28 April 1978, taking over from Tony Blackburn. Edmonds moved to Sunday mornings and early afternoons, from 10am to 1pm, in 1978 and also presented Talkabout, an hour-long talk show broadcast on Thursday evenings. Edmonds left Radio 1 in March 1983. In 2003, Edmonds made a brief radio comeback, taking over the 'drivetime' broadcast on BBC Radio 2 for eight weeks while Johnnie Walker was treated for cancer. His stint on Radio 2 lasted from 4 August until 3 October. In December 2004, Edmonds played a detective on a radio murder mystery play on local station BBC Radio Devon. Television career Edmonds at a Radio 1 Raceday, Mallory Park, May 1976 Edmonds hosted Top of the Pops at various points between 1970 and 1978, during which time he also presented a phone-in programme for teenagers called Z Shed on BBC1 as well as a programme called Hobby Horse. He hosted the children's Saturday-morning programme Multi- Coloured Swap Shop, which ran from 1976 to 1982. With fellow Swap Shop regulars Maggie Philbin and Keith Chegwin, Edmonds was a member of the trio Brown Sauce, which recorded the single \\"I Wanna Be a Winner\\" in 1981. It reached number 15 in the UK singles chart. In 1980, Edmonds took part in the Eurovision Song Contest, introducing the UK entry live on stage at the final in the Hague. During Swap Shop's run Edmonds hosted Lucky Numbers, a Saturday evening phone-in quiz programme which required viewers to call in and answer questions based on clips of films shown, and a revival of the 1960s pop music series Juke Box Jury. Edmonds was one of the original presenters of the BBC's motoring series Top Gear during the late 1970s. During his time on the programme he criticised the Fiat Strada, saying it \\"wasn't very good\\", which caused Fiat to threaten to sue the BBC unless he apologised for the comments. Edmonds reappeared in one episode of Top Gear in the 1990s, to road test the classic 1960s Ford GT40 supercar, of which he owned 2, because the then current host Jeremy Clarkson - at tall - was unable to fit into the cockpit. In 1997 Clarkson was one of Edmonds' star team for the 1997 Le Mans race which was featured in Noel's Le Mans Dream, a 2 part documentary for BBC 2. In the 1980s Edmonds hosted a series on BBC1 called The Time of Your Life, in which celebrities recalled the time they were at their happiest professionally. It ran for three series from 1983. The Late Late Breakfast Show The Late Late Breakfast Show was Edmonds' first Saturday-evening light-entertainment show on the BBC. Presented by Edmonds live on Saturday evenings from 4 September 1982 to 8 November 1986, initially with co-host Leni Harper. It also featured Mike Smith and John Peel. The programme is remembered for several accidents during its regular \\"Give it a Whirl\\" stunt slot; in particular the death of Michael Lush. The show was cancelled by the BBC on 15 November 1986, following the death of Lush two days earlier. While rehearsing a bungee jump to be performed live on the show, Michael Lush plunged to his death when his rope came loose. Edmonds resigned from the BBC immediately afterwards. The Noel Edmonds Show In June 1986, Edmonds hosted The Noel Edmonds Show on the ABC network in the United States. The series was a one-week trial late-night talk show, following Nightline.https://web.archive.org/web/20160610190453/http://www.johnmilesorganisation.org.uk/noel- edmonds Telly Addicts Telly Addicts was a BBC1 game show hosted by Edmonds, who also owned the format. Telly Addicts broadcast for 13 years from 3 September 1985 until 29 July 1998. Questions were based on past and present television programmes, and generally took the form of a short clip being shown followed by a series of questions either specifically about the clip or more generally about the programme from which it had been taken. Two teams sat opposite each other on sofas. In 1991 he presented a prime time series called Noel's Addicts, but this show had no similarity to the Telly Addicts format and only ran for one series. Noel's Saturday Roadshow Noel's Saturday Roadshow was Noel's second BBC television light entertainment show, broadcast live on Saturday evenings from 3 September 1988 to 15 December 1990. Presented by Edmonds, it was his first major TV project since the demise of The Late, Late Breakfast Show two years earlier. The programme contained several elements found in its predecessor, such as phone-in quizzes, celebrity interviews and bands performing in the studio. The programme contained several elements found in its predecessor, such as phone-in quizzes, celebrity interviews and bands performing in the studio. The premise for the new show was that unlike The Late Late Breakfast Show, which had been broadcast from the BBC's studios each week, the Roadshow would come from a new, different and exotic location each week. These 'locations' were in fact elaborate studio sets dressed to resemble each week's location, such as the North Pole, a space station, Hollywood, Niagara Falls. The irony of this was not lost on Edmonds, whose self-deprecating presentation style frequently made light of the low- budget production values. The programme was a slow-burning success and, following the third series in 1990, Edmonds' popularity and reputation were sufficiently re-established with the public for Edmonds to pitch his idea for Noel's House Party to the BBC. The show introduced regular features such as the Gunge Tank, the Gotcha Oscars and Wait 'Til I Get You Home, which would all be carried across and subsequently developed in House Party. Another item was \\"Clown court\\", in which a guest actor from a TV series would be on trial for all the bloopers made during the shooting of that show, for example Sylvester McCoy for the title role of Doctor Who, and Tony Robinson for his character of Baldrick in Blackadder the Third. Noel's House Party By 1991, the Saturday Roadshow morphed into Noel's House Party, which ran for eight years, from Edmonds' mansion in the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom. Regular features included NTV, in which cameras were secretly hidden in viewer's homes, often in VHS tape cases. There was also the \\"Gotchas\\", with celebrities caught in elaborate and embarrassing set-up situations. In one incident NTV's hidden cameras caught celebrity psychic Uri Geller apparently bending a spoon with his hands while demonstrating his \\"powers\\" to a member of the public. When then-Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis was \\"Gotcha'd\\" live on Radio 1, he infamously yelled \\"Edmonds, you are a dead man!\\" He later participated when Edmonds himself was \\"Gotcha'd\\". Mr Blobby, a pink and yellow spotted character, initially appeared in the \\"Gotcha\\" section, and became a regular feature of the programme. The character even achieved the 1993 Christmas No. 1. Noel's House Party was a staple of BBC1's autumn and spring schedules throughout the 1990's. The show regularly attracted audiences of over 15 million but along with the general decline in the traditional Saturday night ratings by the time it ended it was pulling in less than 8 million. In the final programme, broadcast on 20 March 1999, Edmonds signed off with thanks to the audience and the wish that history would be kind to the programme. Deal or No Deal In 2005, Edmonds was persuaded back to TV presentation by Peter Bazalgette, then CEO of Endemol who were experiencing great success with their new game show format of Deal or No Deal. Edmonds initially declined the approach citing that he was concentrating on business interests but eventually agreed to host a short run of 66 shows. The programme was initially recorded in a former paintworks in Bristol but later moved to a dedicated studio in Whitchurch. Deal or No Deal began UK transmission on Monday 31 October 2005, and was broadcast on afternoons six days a week. In March 2006 Edmonds had his contract for presenting Deal or No Deal extended until autumn 2007, for a fee rumoured to be ¬£3 million, making him one of the highest-paid personalities on UK television. Edmonds was nominated for a BAFTA award for his work on the programme but lost out on the night to Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. On 16 March 2007, Edmonds made a cameo appearance as himself in a sketch with Catherine Tate who appeared in the guise of her character Joannie \\"Nan\\" Taylor from The Catherine Tate Show. Nan appeared on a special episode of Deal or No Deal, where she ended up cheating. The sketch was made for the BBC Red Nose Day fundraising programme of 2007. On 27 September 2015, Edmonds received an award from the Atlantic Award Group for his extensive contributions to broadcasting. The selection process was initiated by a nomination by a viewer of Deal or No Deal. Edmonds was the first TV personality to receive an award from the AAG and was also the first recipient from the UK in 2015. Deal or No Deal ran for over 10 years and almost 3000 shows were recorded. In the summer of 2016 by mutual agreement Edmonds and Channel 4 agreed to finally close the doors to the Dream Factory.Deal Or No Deal: No new Channel 4 deal for Noel Edmonds' game show. 19 August 2016. BBC News. Accessed 19 August 2016. In celebration of one of UK TV's longest and most popular gameshow runs, the final shows were recorded on location. Games were filmed on a Boeing 737, the Flying Scotsman, atop the Blackpool Tower and down a cave in Somerset. Fittingly the final show filmed in Glasgow produced the 8th and last winner of the top prize of 250,000. The National Lottery: Everyone's A Winner! On 21 August 2006 it was announced that Edmonds would be returning to the BBC to host a one-off programme called Everyone's A Winner! celebrating National Lottery \\"good causes\\". The programme was broadcast on 23 September 2006. Edmonds had in fact presented the very first National Lottery in 1994 before handing over to Anthea Turner and Gordon Kennedy. Are You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old? On 24 May 2007, Sky One announced that Edmonds would host the UK version of the American hit Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?, titled Are You Smarter than a 10 Year Old?. The programme made its debut on Sky One on 7 October 2007, at 6.00 pm. Edmonds hosted the peak-time showing of the programme, with the daily programme being presented by Dick and Dom. Noel's HQ Sky1's autumn 2008 season saw Edmonds host Noel's HQ, a new live entertainment show with a philanthropic purpose, his fees going to a charitable trust. This was later developed into a series. The show received a negative review from The Guardian. Sky edited a repeat broadcast after Edmonds launched an extended verbal attack on a council press officer. In March 2009, Sky1 announced the cancellation of the show. Cheap Cheap Cheap In 2017, Edmonds presented Cheap Cheap Cheap, a cross between a sitcom and a game show. Edmonds came up with the concept, produced by Hat Trick and Channel 4 commissioned 30 hour-long episodes. The action took place in 'Noel's Store' and according to the Radio Times, \\"contestants are presented with three similar items ‚Äì be it laundry detergent, noodles, baked beans, coffins, live poultry or lottery tickets ‚Äì and must identify the cheapest one of the three in order to win money.\\" A cast of actors play workers at the store. Stuart Heritage of The Guardian said that \\"It's like watching a weird piece of existential Lithuanian amateur community theatre [...] It's the worst idea in the world, stretched out for all eternity\\". The Daily Telegraphs Ed Power described it as \\"naff, tacky and numbingly dull\\" and \\"mind-bendingly outlandish\\". Other television appearances Edmonds was involved in the Live Aid concerts in 1985, transporting stars to and from the Wembley Stadium concert via helicopter and appearing on stage at Wembley to introduce the joint set by Sting and Phil Collins. Edmonds also took Collins to Heathrow Airport, where Collins boarded Concorde to fly to the United States to perform at the Philadelphia concert. Noel's Christmas Presents was an annual broadcast made on Christmas Day in which Edmonds delivered special presents to various people. Some of the gifts included arranging trips to Lapland for ill or disadvantaged children, or arranging family reunions. Noel's Christmas Presents was originally broadcast on BBC One from 1989 until 1999, before it returned to UK screens courtesy of Sky1 on 23 December 2007. Further editions were screened on 21 December 2008, 20 December 2009, 18 December 2010 and 18 December 2011. In the spring 1992 he presented \\"Noel's Addicts\\" He was visited by Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor in 1993 in the introduction of the 30-year Doctor Who anniversary Children in Need special Dimensions in Time, during which the Doctor (correctly) mentioned that Edmonds would still be on television in the year 2010. In 1997, Edmonds was involved in an episode of the Chris Morris spoof documentary series Brass Eye, in which he unwittingly pledged his allegiance on camera to a campaign to rid the country of a new killer drug, the entirely fictitious 'cake', which apparently made ten seconds appear as a few hours to a user by stimulating part of the brain called Shatner's Bassoon. The Curse of Noel Edmonds, a documentary tracing the rise and fall of his showbiz career, was transmitted by Five on 9 November 2004, with former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read being one of the contributors to the programme. Edmonds was also a guest host for the fourth-series episode of The Friday Night Project, broadcast on 26 January 2007.The Channel 4 programme The Friday Night Project, 26 January 2007 In 2014 he appeared in BBC Four's The Life of Rock with Brian Pern as himself. In November 2018, Edmonds became the highest paid participant ever on ITV's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. Edmonds became the first celebrity to leave the series when he was voted out on 30 November 2018 to widespread surprise. Edmonds has hosted major TV events including the BAFTA Awards, the Brit Awards and the launch of the UK National Lottery. Business ventures=Unique Group In 1985, Edmonds formed the Unique Group, which consisted of various operations. The Unique Broadcasting Company Media Group plc (UBCMG) was an independent producer of audio programming in the UK, supplying BBC and independent radio. Michael Peacock was an executive of the group between 1989 and 2005, and former Radio 1 controller Johnny Beerling joined the group following his departure from the network in 1993. It owned Classic Gold Digital before selling the stations back to GCap Media which merged them into the Gold network. Edmonds resigned as non-executive director of UBCMG in March 2006 as a direct result of the success of Deal or No Deal. As of 2006, Edmonds also had interests in Unique Motor Company, a producer of small off-road vehicles. In July 2019, Edmonds agreed a compensation deal with Lloyds Banking Group as a victim of the HBOS Reading branch fraud. He had claimed that bank staff had destroyed Unique Group. Theme parks Edmonds-licensed theme park attractions based on Crinkley Bottom and Mr Blobby were set up in existing parks at Cricket St Thomas in Somerset and Pleasurewood Hills Theme Park in Lowestoft, Suffolk. A park was also built in Morecambe, Lancashire, on the site of the former Happy Mount Park. Following disappointing visitor numbers, and in the case of Morecambe, legal disputes with the local council, the deal was scrapped and the park closed. The two existing parks reverted to their previous state. Edmonds was said to be very critical of Lancaster City Council's management of the Morecambe park. A report by the District Auditor found that the council had behaved 'unlawfully' in its dealings with Edmonds, which cost ¬£2.5m, and two former senior officers were found to have committed 'misconduct', although this was not deemed to be 'wilful'. The affair was dubbed 'Blobbygate' by the media. Buying the BBC In March 2014, Edmonds declared on Newsnight that he was part of a consortium which planned to buy the BBC, because the corporation is \\"sleepwalking itself to destruction\\". He said that he did not have a TV licence and watched BBC programmes only on catch-up. Political views Edmonds is a trustee of the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF), an organisation which is staunchly opposed to wind farms. He was said to have joined \\"because of the threat near his home in Devon\\".Edmonds joins fight against wind farms (Guardian - 15 July 2004). He has been quoted as saying that, \\"Politicians are promoting the wind industry as a green icon, but they are misleading the public into believing the propaganda of the wind industry. The reality is that wind power is too costly and can never meet our energy needs; but it will destroy the countryside\\". His view is that those who are promoting wind farms are energy companies with a vested financial interest and that wind turbines are not reliable enough as a source of sustainable energy. Edmonds is an outspoken critic of immigration and the BBC's Welsh Language Service. He coordinated the Heart of Devon campaign to provide information for farmers affected by the foot and mouth epidemic in 2001. TV licence boycott Edmonds said that he had stopped payment on his TV licence in early 2008, in response to the sometimes controversial methods used to enforce collection of the TV licence fee. Edmonds said that it is wrong to \\"threaten\\" and \\"badger\\" people, in response to the collection authority's common assumption that the non-possession of a licence can mean licence evasion, as well as the large fines which can be used as enforcement for non-payment. TV Licensing later claimed that Edmonds did possess a valid current TV licence, but this claim was denied by a spokesman for Edmonds; who said that TV Licensing had their facts wrong. Spiritualism For many years, Edmonds has been a believer in Spiritualism, in particular the concept of cosmic ordering, a subject he became interested in after being introduced to B√§rbel Mohr's book The Cosmic Ordering Service - A Guide to Realising Your Dreams by his reflexologist. He had not worked on TV since the end of his BBC TV show Noel's House Party in 1999 and one of his wishes was for a new challenge. Later he was offered the chance to return to TV to work on Deal or No Deal.DEAR COSMOS, CAN I HAVE A HIT SHOW? Daily Record, 3 April 2006. Edmonds later went on to write his own book titled Positively Happy: Cosmic Ways To Change Your Life. Edmonds said in 2008 that he is constantly accompanied by two melon-sized \\"spiritual energy\\" balls, which appear over his shoulders and which he believes to be the spirits of his dead parents. \\"Orbs are little bundles of positive energy and they think they can move between 500 and 1,000 miles per hour,\\" according to Edmonds. \\"They look like little round planets but they come in all shapes and sizes.\\" He has asserted that the orbs appear only on digital photographs. In August 2015, Edmonds gave an interview to the Daily Mirror in which he stated that the greatest problem facing humanity was \\"electrosmog\\" due to Wi-Fi and other \\"systems\\", causing the destruction of \\"our natural electro-magnetic fields\\". He also stated a belief that death was impossible because the body was merely a container for \\"a universal energy\\", and that this had \\"been known for a very long time\\". When he dies, Edmonds anticipates that \\"My energy will return to where it came from ‚Äì part of a massive, incomprehensible universal web of energy\\". EMP Pad On 7 June 2016, Edmonds said on Twitter that an Electromagnetic Pulse device costing ¬£2,315 was \\"A simple box that slows ageing, reduces pain, lifts depression and stress and tackles cancer. Yep tackles cancer!\\". Edmonds provoked further criticism after tweeting to a man with kidney cancer, lymph node metastases and psoriatic arthritis that \\"Scientific fact-disease is caused by negative energy. Is it possible your ill health is caused by your negative attitude? #explore.\\" The following day, Edmonds was interrogated by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on ITV's This Morning television programme stating that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in November 2013. He said that a \\"very stressful, very negative period\\" in life had caused his prostate cancer, \\"I was, I thought, very, very healthy. I know why I got my cancer... the definition of stress is negative energy. It didn't just decide to manifest itself, there was cause\\". He went on to add: \\"I then had my tumour destroyed by sound waves, proving yet again energy is at the heart of this issue\\" and said that \\"I believe pulsed electromagnetism has a role to play in tackling cancer and I will always believe that\\". In response, the firm responsible for the device, EMP Pad Limited, said it did not agree with his claim \\"in any way, shape or form\\", and that they had not paid him in relation to it. While EMP Pad Limited said it did not pay Edmonds to promote the product, the company's owner Maria Robertson, previously worked as an assistant to the TV presenter and acknowledged having known Edmonds for 25 years and having worked with him and his daughter. Cancer Research UK produced an article to reassure the public that \\"the best studies looking at this topic have failed to show a link between emotional stress and an increased risk of cancer\\" and that \\"no reliable evidence has ever been produced that Rife machines ‚Äì or any similar devices producing low-frequency electromagnetic pulses ‚Äì have any benefit for cancer patients. Nor have organisations that scrutinise new treatments and devices (like the US Food and Drug Authority or the European Medicines Agency) approved any as a therapy for any type of disease\\". David Grimes, a cancer researcher at Oxford University, told This Morning: \\"It's not just untrue, it's patronising and victim blaming, cancer is bad luck... the healthiest people in the world get cancer and it‚Äôs not because they are negative\\". Prof. John Gribben, Chair of Medical Oncology at Queen Mary University of London, said: \\"This is complete gibberish and undermines all the good work everyone does with evidence-based medicine and targeted approaches\\". Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor at the University of Exeter said: \\"The reason why most of us put 'negative energy' in inverted commas is simple: it is a pure figment of the imagination of fantasists. That would not be so bad except that, as we see, some VIPs seem to take this nonsense seriously. The result might be that some desperate patients believe them, and choose the nonsense over the best that real medicine has to offer. And that could hasten deaths.\\" The UK's Advertising Standards Authority said that it was \\"urgently looking into\\" a complaint made over the claims, because advertising any proven or unproven cancer treatment would violate the Cancer Act 1939 if payments had been made. Later, the ASA said that no rules had been broken. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said that it was investigating the products available from EMP Pad \\"to determine whether there are any breaches of the Medical Device Regulations 2002\\".  Dispute with Lloyds Bank  A major turning point for Edmonds was the 2005 collapse of his entertainment company Unique Group ‚Äì an umbrella for various production companies that owned the rights to, among other things, Mr Blobby and Telly Addicts. Edmonds remains in his pursuit of Lloyds Bank, whom he holds responsible, seeking ¬£60m in losses and damages. The bank disputes his claims. Edmonds complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the \\"By Your Side\\" Lloyds marketing campaign, claiming it was hypocritical; the complaint was not upheld, but the large amount of press coverage was damaging for the bank. Personal life Edmonds married Gillian Slater in 1971, but the marriage ended in divorce after eleven years. From July 1986 to 2005, he was married to Helen Soby; the couple have four daughters. In July 2009, Edmonds married his third wife, Liz Davies, a make-up artist on the programme Deal or No Deal. Edmonds is a licensed helicopter pilot, and one of his early personal aircraft was registered G-NOEL. He was president of the British Horse Society between 2004 and 2007. In June 2017, Edmonds said he attempted suicide in 2005 after fraud by a group of HBOS financiers destroyed his Unique Group business: \\"Until these criminals took me to the brink of emotional annihilation, I had always felt those who opt out by taking their own lives were selfish and cowardly... But having been cast into that bottomless dark space devoid of logic and reason, I have a much deeper understanding of life without hope... I seek no sympathy and feel no shame in admitting that on the evening of January 18th 2005 I attempted to end the overwhelming mental pain which had consumed my whole being.\\" In September 2017, Edmonds said there was a direct link between fraudulent HBOS financiers causing stress and his prostate cancer. He stated: \\"I don't say cancer was caused by the stress, but that my health deteriorated to such an extent I got prostate cancer. I am absolutely sure the negative forces acting on me impacted on my health. There is a wealth of information from various clinical studies of a direct link between stress and cancer.

Established in 1824, it has been the top-ranked law school in the United States by U.S. News and World Report every year since the magazine began publishing law school rankings in the 1980s.ABA Journal , \\"It's Official: Yale Law School Tops US News Rankings,\\" April 23, 2009 (2010 rankings). See also: Yale Daily News , \\"Yale Law still number one,\\" March 16, 2011 (2012 rankings). The school's small size and prestige make its admissions process the most selective of any law school in the United States, with an acceptance rate of 6.7% in the 2017-18 cycle. Its yield rate of 85% is consistently the highest of any law school in the United States. Yale Law has produced a significant number of luminaries in law and politics, including United States presidents Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton and former U.S. secretary of state and presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Alumni also include current United States Supreme Court associate justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Brett Kavanaugh, as well as a number of former justices, including Abe Fortas, Potter Stewart and Byron White; several heads of state around the world, including Karl Carstens, the fifth president of Germany, Jose P. Laurel, the third president of the Republic of the Philippines; and Peter Mutharika, the immediate former president of Malawi; five current U.S. senators; the former governor of California and current governor of Rhode Island; and the current deans of three of the top fourteen-ranked law schools in the United States: Virginia, Cornell, and Georgetown. Each class in Yale Law's three-year J.D. program enrolls approximately 200 students. Yale's flagship law review is the Yale Law Journal, one of the most highly cited legal publications in the United States. According to Yale Law School's ABA-required disclosures, 83% of the Class of 2018 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required or JD-advantage employment nine months after graduation, excluding solo practitioners.  Culture  Yale Law School is housed in the Sterling Law Building, erected in 1931. Modeled after the English Inns of Court, the law building is located at the heart of Yale's campus and contains a law library, a dining hall, and a courtyard. The institution is known for its scholarly orientation; a relatively large number of its graduates (9%) choose careers in academia within five years of graduation, while a relatively low number (46%) choose to work in law firms five years after graduation. Another feature of Yale Law's culture since the 1930s, among both faculty and student graduates, has been an emphasis on the importance of spending at least a few years in government service.Statement of Dean Harold H. Koh, \\"Yale Law School Expands Public Interest Program, Financial Support for Graduates,\\" April 14, 2008. A similar emphasis has long been placed on service as a judicial law clerk upon graduation.Top-law- schools.com. Its 7.6:1 student-to-faculty ratio is the third lowest among U.S. law schools. Yale Law does not have a traditional grading system, a consequence of student unrest in the late 1960s.Kalman, Laura, Yale Law School and the Sixties: Revolt and Reverberations (Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 2005) Instead, it grades first-semester first-year students on a simple Credit/No Credit system. For their remaining two-and-a-half years, students are graded on an Honors/Pass/Low Pass/Fail system. Similarly, the school does not rank its students. It is also notable for having only a single semester of required classes (plus two additional writing requirements), instead of the full year most U.S. schools require. Unusually, and as a result of unique Connecticut State court rules, Yale Law allows first-year students to represent clients through one of its numerous clinics; other law schools typically offer this opportunity only to second- and third-year students. Students publish nine law journals that, unlike those at most other schools, mostly accept student editors without a competition. The only exception is YLS's flagship journal, the Yale Law Journal, which holds a two-part admissions competition each spring, consisting of a four or five-hour \\"bluebooking exam,\\" followed by a traditional writing competition. Although the Journal identifies a target maximum number of members to accept each year, it is not a firm number. Other leading student-edited publications include the Yale Journal on Regulation, the Yale Law and Policy Review, and the Yale Journal of International Law. In November 2013, it was announced that a $25 million donation would bring student dormitory living back onto campus, with renovations to begin in 2018.  Rankings and reputation  Yale Law has been ranked the number one law school in the country by U.S. News and World Report in every year in which the magazine has published law school rankings.2009 Top-law-schools.com (\\"Since US News began ranking schools, Yale Law School has always held the #1 position....\\"). See also ABA Journal , \\"It's Official: Yale Law School Tops US News Rankings,\\" Apr. 23, 2009 (2010 rankings). Among U.S. law schools, Yale has the lowest acceptance rate and the highest yield rate‚Äîwhereas less than 10% of applicants are admitted, about 80% of those who are accepted ultimately enroll, either in the Fall following their acceptance or after a deferral. It is currently ranked as the second best law school in U.S (behind Harvard) and fourth in the world by the 2016 QS Rankings. The school also saw a greater percentage of its students go on to become Supreme Court clerks between the 2000 and 2010 terms than any other law school, more than double the percentage of the second-highest law school (Harvard Law School).Leiter Rankings: Clerkship Placement. However, because of its greater size, approximately 2.5 times that of Yale, Harvard had a greater total number of Supreme Court clerks‚Äîapproximately 25% more. Id. In addition to producing the most Supreme Court clerks per capita, Yale saw a greater percentage of its graduates accept federal clerkships among the United States Courts of Appeal and District Courts than any other law school; more than one third of Yale graduates go on to clerk for a federal judge. Additionally, a 2010 survey of \\"scholarly impact,\\" measured by per capita citations to faculty scholarship, found Yale's faculty to be the most cited law school faculty in the United States.  History  The School began in the New Haven law office of Seth P. Staples in the 1800s, who began training lawyers. By 1810 he was operating a law school. He took on a former student, Samuel J. Hitchcock as a law partner, and Hitchcock became the proprietor of the New Haven Law School, joined by David Daggett in 1824. (The Yale Law School shield, shown at the upper right of this page, shows staples and a rampant dog, representing Seth Staples and David Daggett.) The school's affiliation with Yale began in the mid-1820s and in 1843, the school's students began receiving Yale degrees. Sculptural ornamentation on the Sterling Law Building Yale Law School Class of 1883 Four African-American students, Class of 1921  Legal Realism movement  Beginning in this period, a special relationship or connection developed between YLS and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Professors Clark and Frank, among others, became judges on that court. Some of the faculty members who became Second Circuit judges continued to teach courses at YLS and chose their clerks from student graduates. These judges influenced thinking in general at YLS and particularly reinforced student interest in public service, a characteristic tradition at YLS since the New Deal.  Early 21st century  The law school's 15th dean, Harold Koh (2004‚Äì2009), made human rights a focus of the law school's work, building on a tradition that had developed over the previous two decades. On March 23, 2009, the White House announced the appointment of Koh to the United States Department of State as the Legal Adviser of the Department of State. Robert C. Post was selected to replace him as dean of the law school.Robert Post LAW ‚Äô77 named Law School dean  Yale Daily News. Yale Daily News (2009-06-22). Retrieved on 2013-08-12.  Admissions  Yale Law School enrolls about 200 new students a year, one of the smallest numbers among U.S. law schools. Its small class size and prestige combine to make its admissions process the most competitive in the United States. Half of the class that entered in 2015 had a GPA above 3.93 and/or an LSAT score above 173 (on a possible scale of 120 to 180) or 99th percentile. After an initial round of screening by the admissions department, approximately 25% of applications are independently evaluated by three different faculty members. Each application is scored from 2‚Äì4 at the discretion of the reader. All applicants with a perfect 12 (i.e., a 4 from all three faculty members) are admitted, upon which they are immediately notified by the school. There are also 50‚Äì80 outstanding students admitted each year without going through this review process. The LL.M. Program and the Visiting Researchers Program at Yale Law are amongst the smallest and most selective graduate law programs in the United States. Yale Law admits around 25 LL.M. students and around 10 visiting researchers every year. These programs are usually limited to those students who intend to pursue a career in legal academia. Yale Law admitted only men until 1918.Stevens, Robert Bocking. Law school: legal education in America from the 1850s to the 1980s p. 84. Link to page in Google Book Search.  Employment  According to Yale Law School's official 2013 ABA-required disclosures, 78.8% of the Class of 2013 accepted full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation, excluding solo-practitioners. Yale Law School's Law School Transparency under- employment score is 8.4%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. The mean salary for a class of 2014 graduate 10 months after graduation was $109,102. The law school was ranked # 17 of all law schools nationwide by the National Law Journal in terms of sending the highest percentage of 2015 graduates to the largest 100 law firms in the US (23.58%).  Costs  The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Yale Law School for the 2015‚Äì2016 academic year is $78,326. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance (including cost of living) for three years is $289,879.  Clinical Programs  The Yale Law School houses over two dozen clinics that allow students to represent clients in real-world legal problems. Participation in clinics is common among Yale Law students, with over 80% of degree candidates participating in clinical activities prior to graduation. Yale Law's clinics cover a wide range of issue areas and legal fields. Students represent clients before courts at all levels of the federal judiciary, state courts in Connecticut and other states, international tribunals and adjudicative bodies, administrative processes, and private arbitration. The Yale Law School has greatly expanded its clinical programs in recent years, adding eight new clinics during the 2016-2017 academic year.

He is played by Max Grod√©nchik. Rom is a Ferengi, the son of Keldar and Ishka. He is Quark's younger brother, and the father of Nog. Overview Born around 2335, Rom did not have the business acumen typically associated with the Ferengi race; he was described as one who \\"didn't have the 'lobes' for business\\". He had a knack for fixing things but, until around 2372, he worked exclusively as a waiter and stock boy in his brother Quark's bar on Deep Space Nine (DS9). In the first episode, he was credited only as \\"Ferengi Pit Boss\\". Rom frequently displays a lack of confidence, largely due to Quark's habit of belittling him. However, there is evidence to suggest that Quark was attempting to protect Rom from inevitable failure by preventing him from venturing into business for himself. Nevertheless, after four years living among Federation and Bajoran citizens on the station, and possibly inspired by his son Nog's admission to Starfleet (which made him very proud), Rom left the bar to become an engineer in the Bajoran Militia. Odo once described Rom as \\"an idiot, [who] couldn't fix a straw if it was bent\\". These opinions, however, were only due to Rom's social ineptitude and meek, almost subservient, demeanor (largely due to the near-constant verbal and emotional torment he suffers at the hands of Quark), and stood in stark contrast to his genius as an engineer. This talent allowed him to play an important role in the station's participation in the Dominion War. In 2373, Rom designed and distributed a self-replicating minefield that blocked access to the Bajoran wormhole and prevented Dominion reinforcements from entering the Alpha Quadrant for several months. His first wife, Prinadora, bore his son Nog. She stayed behind on Ferenginar when Rom first came to Deep Space Nine, but the marriage was later dissolved after she and her father stole the bulk of his profits. Rom eventually married Leeta, a Bajoran Dabo girl employed at Quark's bar, after a period of doubt about her love after having been burned in his first marriage. When Grand Nagus Zek became less greedy after coming into contact with the Bajoran prophets, he founded the Ferengi Benevolent Association and appointed Rom chairman (\\"Prophet Motive\\"). However, acting atypically, Rom took advantage of the opportunity and embezzled money from the charity. Throughout his seven years on DS9, Rom underwent great personal growth as a colleague, parent, and in nearly every other aspect of his life and career. He also proved valuable, on several occasions, in helping his people deal with important issues facing their society. In 2375, to the shock of everyone, including Rom himself, Zek appointed Rom to succeed him as Grand Nagus, becoming the new leader of the Ferengi and their economy. Rom's political affiliations are frequently hinted as being left-wing and more liberal than those of his brother. In the episode 'Bar Association' he forms a union of the bar staff at Quark's bar and quotes Karl Marx (\\"Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!\\") as well as demonstrating admiration for Miles O'Brien's ancestor, Sean Aloysius O'Brien, a union leader. Quark, Rom and Nog do not understand or speak English/Federation Standard, but rather rely on Universal Translators implanted near their ears (\\"Little Green Men\\").

Lap joints can be used to join wood, plastic, or metal. A lap joint may be a full lap or half lap. In a full lap, no material is removed from either of the members that will be joined, resulting in a joint which is the combined thickness of the two members. In a half lap joint or halving joint, material is removed from both of the members so that the resulting joint is the thickness of the thickest member. Most commonly in half lap joints, the members are of the same thickness and half the thickness of each is removed. With respect to wood joinery, this joint, where two long-grain wood faces are joined with glue, is among the strongest in ability to resist shear forces, exceeding even mortise and tenon and other commonly-known \\"strong\\" joints. Wood Magazine \\"Wood Joint Torture Test\\" With respect to metal welding, this joint, made by overlapping the edges of the plate, is not recommended for most work. The single lap has very little resistance to bending. It can be used satisfactorily for joining two cylinders that fit inside one another.Single Lap Joint. \\"What is welding?\\" Applications * Frame assembly in cabinet making * Temporary framing * Some applications in timber frame construction * Tabling Halving laps Halving lap joints are used extensively in transition and cabinetry for framing. They are quick and easy to make and provide high strength through good long grain to long grain gluing surface. The shoulders provide some resistance to racking (diagonal distortion). They may be reinforced with dowels or mechanical fasteners to resist twisting of the wood. End lap Also known simply as a pull lap, it is the basic form of the lap joint and is used when joining members end to end either parallel or at right angles. When the joint forms a corner, as in a rectangular frame, the joint is often called a corner lap. This is the most common form of end lap and is used most in framing. For a half lap in which the members are parallel, the joint may be known as a half lap splice. This is a splice joint and is an alternative to scarfing when joining shorter members end to end. Both members in an end lap have one shoulder and one cheek each. Use for: * Internal cabinet frames * Visible frames when the frame members are to be shaped. Cross lap The main difference between this and the basic half lap is that the joint occurs in the middle of one or both members, rather than at the end. The two members are at right angles to each other and one member may terminate at the joint, or it may carry on beyond it. When one of the members terminates at the shin, it is often referred to as a tee lap or middle lap. In a cross lap where both members continue beyond the joint, each member has two shoulders and one cheek. Use for: * Internal cabinet frames * Simple framing and bracing Dovetail lap This is a lap in which the housing has been cut at an angle which resists withdrawal of the stem from the cross-piece. Use for: * Framing applications where tension forces could pull the joint apart Mitred half lap The mitred half lap is the weakest version of the joint because of the reduced gluing surface. Use for: * Visible framing applications where a mitred corner is desired See also * Bridle joint * Halved joint * Scarf joint * Splice joint * Finger joint External links *Types of Timber Joints Used in Woodworking - Heaps of practical information on various types of timber joints.

The company was established in 1953 through the merger of farm equipment makers Massey-Harris of Canada and the Ferguson Company of the United Kingdom. It was based in Brantford, Ontario, until 1988. The company transferred its headquarters in 1997 to Buffalo, New York, before it was acquired by AGCO, the new owner of its former competitor Allis-Chalmers. Massey Ferguson is one of several brands produced by AGCO, and it remains a major seller around the world.  History = Massey Manufacturing Co.  In 1847, Daniel Massey established the Newcastle Foundry and Machine Manufactory in what is now Newcastle, Ontario. The company made some of the world's first mechanical threshers, at first by assembling parts from the United States, but eventually designing and building its own equipment. Daniel Massey's son, Hart Massey, subsequently renamed the enterprise as the Massey Manufacturing Co. In 1879, the company moved to Toronto, where it soon became one of the city's leading employers. The huge complex of factories, consisting of a site with plant and head office at 915 King Street West (now part of Liberty Village), became one of the best-known features of the city. The company expanded further and began to sell its products internationally. Through extensive advertising campaigns, it became one of the most well-known brands in Canada. A labour shortage throughout the country also helped to make the firm's mechanized equipment very attractive.  Massey-Harris Limited  Massey-Harris logo, c. 1952 Share of Massey- Harris Limited, issued February 18, 1916 In 1891, the Massey Manufacturing Co. merged with A. Harris, Son and Company to form Massey-Harris Limited,Unofficial Massey-Harris home page which became the largest agricultural equipment maker in the British Empire.

It was too heavy and expensive for extensive mass production, but served as a guide for the design of the lighter and less costly No. 21 which was tested in 1940, and put on sale in 1941. The Massey- Harris No. 21 Combine was commemorated with a Canada Post stamp on June 8, 1996.Massey-Harris No. 21 Combine commemorative stamp bulletin E.P. Taylor, one of C.D. Howe's dollar-a-year men, joined the board of directors in 1942, and Eric Phillips joined management in 1946. The final generation of Massey- Harris tractors, introduced immediately after World War II, included the 25-horsepower M-H 22 series, the 35 horsepower M-H 33 series, the 45 horsepower M-H 44 series and the 55 horsepower M-H 55 series. In 1952, the M-H 22 was replaced by the M-H 23 Mustang. In 1955, the 30-horsepower Massey- Harris 50 was introduced after the merger that created Massey-Harris-Ferguson. It was based on the Ferguson TO-35 and was also produced as the F-40 for Ferguson dealers. The MH-50 was available in several configurations: utility, high-crop utility, or row-crop with a choice of single, tricycle, or wide adjustable front ends. In 1956, the M-H 33 was replaced by the MH 333, while the M-H 44 was replaced by the M-H 444 and the M-H 55 was replaced by the M-H 555. These tractors were commonly known as the \\"triple series\\" and were mechanically similar to their predecessors, but featured new styling that included a slightly different hood design, chrome trim on the grill and hood, and a different color scheme. They were also available with power steering, live power take-off (PTO) and hydraulics. The Massey Harris triple series tractors remained in production until 1958.  Sawyer-Massey  In a complex turn of events, the Massey family turned to steam engine builder L.D. Sawyer & Company of Hamilton, Ontario, and started a line of steam tractors. These engines were quite successful and were built in a number of sizes. The 25 horsepower was popular, and the expanding Prairie provinces clamoured for big breaking engines. Massey also experimented with tandem compound engines. Sawyer Massey lasted only until 1910, when the firm was wound down, and Massey went into oil-fired internal combustion engines. Sawyer-Massey and Massey- Harris were two separate companies, both managed by the Massey family.  Wallis Gas Tractor and wider influence  A 1928 Wallis Massey began experimenting with oil engines about 1910, with engines such as the Bulldog. However, success came only later in the 1920s with the Wallis line of tractors which was purchased by the firm. In the 1930s, it introduced the first self- propelled combine harvester. Massey Harris also produced one of the world's first four-wheel drive tractors. Hart Massey's sons Charles, Walter, Chester and Fred became closely involved in the business and eventually took over its operations. They were the last generation of Masseys to run Massey-Harris. Other members of the family went on to other accomplishments: Vincent Massey became Governor General of Canada and Raymond Massey became a noted actor in American films. The Massey family used its fortune to improve the city of Toronto and many institutions, such as the University of Guelph, University of Toronto, Upper Canada College, Crescent School, Appleby College, Massey Hall and Metropolitan United Church, were partially financed by the Masseys.  Military contracts  During and after World War II, Massey Harris undertook a number of contracts to produce tractors, tanks and self-propelled artillery vehicles for the United States Armed Forces. Vehicles produced by Massey Harris include the following: * M5 Stuart light tank (250 M5s, and 3,530 M5A1s built) * M24 Chaffee light tank * M41 Howitzer Motor Carriage self-propelled artillery (built on M24 chassis) * M44 self propelled howitzer (250 built in early 1950s on M41 Walker Bulldog tank chassis) * M36 Jackson tank destroyer * M19 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage Self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery vehicle (300 built) * I-162 Military tractor built for the United States Army (25 built) * I-244 Military tractor built for the United States Air Force, United States Navy, and United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1955 and 1956 * I-330 Military tractor built for the United States Navy (6 built)  Massey- Harris-Ferguson  In 1953, Massey-Harris merged with the Ferguson Company to become Massey-Harris-Ferguson, before finally taking on its current name in 1958.  Massey Ferguson  The name was shortened to Massey Ferguson in 1958. They tried to consolidate the two dealer networks and product lines. Its television and radio advertising featured an upbeat jingle with a male chorus singing, \\"He's a get-up-early, keep-'em-rollin, Massey-Ferguson kind of a man.\\" Nevertheless, the company soon began to decline financially after facing increasing international competition in the 1960s, when the firm began to struggle. = Hanomag-Cura, Argentina = In 1971, Massey purchased the local facilities of Rheinstahl Hanomag-Cura in Argentina, which had been established in 1960. The production of tractors and other agricultural implements, during until 1999. Some model numbers made in Argentina included 65R/250/252, 155, 150, 5160 S-2 / S-4, 5140 / 5140-4, 265, 255, 250, 250 S \\"vi√±atero\\", 8500 and 9500. Other model numbers included 1075, 1078, 1095h, 1098, 1175 / 1175 S, 1185 / 1185 S, 1195 L / 1195 S-2/S-4, 1215 S-2 / S-4, 1340 S-2/S-4, 1360 S2/S4, 1615 L / S 1615 L, 1640, 1650, 1670, 1690, 1465, 1475 \\"Super alto, 1485, 1499 SX / 1499 L. = Sunshine, Australia = In 1955, Massey purchased the Australian manufacturers of Sunshine harvesters, H.V. McKay Pty Limited. Hugh Victor McKay had invented the combine harvester in 1884, the first machine to combine the functions of reaping, threshing and winnowing grain from a standing crop. By the 1920s, H.V. McKay Pty Ltd was running the largest implement factory in the southern hemisphere, covering , and led the international agricultural industry through the development of the world's first self-propelled harvester in 1924. In 1930, the H.V. McKay Pty Limited was granted exclusive Australian distribution of Massey-Harris machinery. The company was then renamed H.V. McKay Massey Harris Pty Ltd. Throughout World War II, H.V. McKay Massey Harris exported over 20,000 Sunshine drills, disc harrows and binders to England to facilitate the increase in food production. In 1955, the remainder of H.V. McKay Pty Ltd was sold to Massey Ferguson. Manufacturing ended in 1986, and the last section was sold off and demolished in 1992. The former bulk store, factory gates and clock tower, the pedestrian footbridge, factory gardens, and head office complex still exist and are all listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.Victorian Heritage Database Report: Massey Ferguson Complex = Landini = In 1959, Massey bought 100% of Landini, based in Italy. Landini has built many models for Massey over the years, especially vineyard and crawler models. Massey sold 66% to ARGO SpA in 1989, some to Iseki later on, and the final portion was sold to ARGO in 2000. = Perkins = In 1959, Perkins Engines from Peterborough, England was purchased. Perkins have been the main Diesel engine supplier for Massey Ferguson for many years. In 1990, Massey Ferguson took over Dorman Diesels of Stafford and merged it with Perkins to form Perkins Engines (Stafford) Ltd. In the 1980s, Perkins purchased Rolls Royce (Diesels) Ltd, to form Perkins Engines (Shrewsbury) Ltd. In 1998, Perkins was sold off by then-owner LucasVarity to Caterpillar Inc., who were a major customer for their smaller and mid-sized engines; Caterpillar was a major producer of large Diesel engines for stationary and mobile application.The Massey Legacy, by John Farnworth, = Ebro of Spain = In 1966, Massey purchased 32% of the Spanish tractor and auto company Ebro, or Motor Iberica. Ebro had previously built Ford tractors under license, but now began building models for Massey, and Massey models under license. Massey sold its interest to Nissan in the 1980s. In the early 1960s, Massey Ferguson moved their head office from 915 King Street to the Sun Life Tower at 200 University Avenue in the Downtown Toronto. In 1969, Massey Ferguson began producing a line of snowmobiles under the name 'Ski Whiz'. The snowmobile line was discontinued in 1977, due to a decline in sales. = Activities in Germany = In 1973, Massey purchased German Eicher tractor and many Massey-licensed Eichers were built. They later sold their interest and Dromson now owns Eicher which now builds specialized tractors for vineyards and such. The firm then purchased control of Hanomag in 1974. After a loss of $250 million over the next five years, Hanomag was sold off. = Conrad Black take-over = On 16 August 1978, Conrad Black, whose family had obtained control of Argus Corporation, an investor in Massey Ferguson, became active in Massey Ferguson's management. The previous year, chairman Albert A. Thornbrough received a $471,000 salary, the highest executive salary in Canada at the time. During the 50 years between 1929 and 1979, the firm made more than 4% profit on its sales only five times. Under Black's leadership, Massey Ferguson instituted significant cost-cutting programmes that returned it to profitability. During the late 1970s, production was relocated to a new, large facility in Brantford, Ontario. In 1978, Massey Ferguson was the first to introduce an electronic control system for the three-point hitch on a tractor. However, a worldwide decline in the agricultural equipment market combined with high inflation, high domestic interest rates and a major recession, caused Massey Ferguson to slip into a loss once again. On 31 October 1979, Volkswagen AG made an informal offer for 51% of the firm, but was rebuffed by Black. On 23 May 1980, Black resigned as chairman. In a subsequent series of detailed and lengthy letters to Herb Gray‚Äîthe then Canadian Minister of Industry under the government of Pierre Trudeau‚Äîhe remarked on the challenges faced by the firm, and outlined his solution, which would have seen the Canadian and Ontario governments as well as Argus Corporation refloat the ailing firm. Black failed to obtain a suitable response, and resolved to cut his losses. = Renamed to Varity = In October 1980, Argus donated its shares in Massey Ferguson to the employee's pension plans, leading the way to a $250 million bail-out from the Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario for the collapsing business, which later was renamed Varity Corporation. In the mid-1980s, Varity spun off several money-losing divisions into an entity called Massey Combines Corporation in 1985. Massey Combines Corporation was headquartered in Brantford and became insolvent on 4 March 1988,Per MCC Employee and its assets were re-acquired by Massey Ferguson. = Fermec sale = In 1992, a management buyout of MF Industrial created Fermec, which finally ceased trading in 2001 when it was taken over by the Terex Corporation, formerly a unit of General Motors. This encompassed all construction equipment from Massey. It was then purchased by Case Corporation in 1997. Varity left Toronto and relocated to their head offices to the Williams-Butler House at 672 Delaware Avenue in the Millionaire Row area of Buffalo, New York. The Toronto manufacturing complex has since been demolished, leaving only its head office building. Despite its hardships, Massey Ferguson was selling 25% more tractors than its nearest competitors at this time. In 1995, Massey Ferguson's worldwide holdings were purchased by the United States-based AGCO Corporation. In August 1996, Varity merged with Lucas Automotive to become LucasVarity. After a series of mergers and takeovers, the remains of LucasVarity were acquired by the United States company TRW. Since 1962, Massey Ferguson has been the world's leading tractor brand. Currently, there are more Massey Ferguson tractors than any other in the world. Models A Massey Ferguson 35 Massey Ferguson developed a wide range of agricultural vehicles and have a large share in the market across the world especially in Europe. In December 1957, the MF35 which was the first Massey Ferguson branded tractor rolled off the factory floor. It was a Ferguson design that started its life in 1955 as the Ferguson 35, often nicknamed \\"Gold Belly\\" due to the gold engine and gearbox. The 35s were massively popular and sold across the UK, Australia, Ireland and the United States. These were followed by other early models like the 65 (MK1 indirect injection) 65 (MK2 direct injection). The next big selling model was the MF135 which became widely popular because of its reliability and power compared to other tractors at the time. This was the first model in the MF 100 series. These included the MF 130, 133, 135, 145, 148, 150, 158, 165, 168, 175, 178, 180, 185 and 188.The same time the MF 100 series came out, the MF 1000 series was introduced. These include the MF 1080, 1100, 1130 and 1150. Later came the MF 550, 560, 565, 575, 590, 595 (500 series). From the mid-1970s and early 1980s came the 200 series tractor, which included the MF 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 278, 280, 285, 290, 298, 299. In the mid-1980s, the short-lived 600 series was released. This included the 675, 690, 690T, 695, 698 and 699. The reason behind poor sales figures was due to unattractive styling and poor ergonomics, with the cab sitting much higher than previous MF tractors. Although the cab did give excellent visibility and a flat floor, being high off the ground meant it was best suited to field operations instead of livestock work. The 600 series was one of the first tractors to offer the user an option to control where the hydraulic fluid should be pumped. By moving a switch situated near the floor of the cab, the user could block off flow to the rear hydraulics and link arms, concentrating the full force of the pump on the front loader if equipped. In the late 1980s, one of the greatest selling tractors of all time was released- the 300 series Massey Ferguson. Excellent power, simplicity of cab, high range of gears and components made the MF 300 series a success especially in Europe. The range included the MF 340, 350, 352, 355, 362, 365, 372, 375, 382, 383, 390, 390T, 393, 394, 395, 398, 399 and 399T (the most powerful and popular Massey Ferguson 399) with horsepower ranging from 45HP to 104HP. The 300 series was also offered with a choice of cab, Hi-Line or Lo-Line. The Hi-Line cab featured a flat floor whilst the Lo- Line cab had a hump in the middle for the transmission tunnel. Some 'original' examples of the lower horsepower 300-series have been known to fetch prices exceeding ¬£20,000 because of their rarity. In the mid-1990s, the 6100 series and 8100 series were released including the 6150, 6180 and 8130. Massey Ferguson MF 6290 tractor towing a grain trailer Tractors that came after the 300 series included the 4200 range, the 4300 range, 3600 (early 1990s), 3000/3100 (early to mid-1990s), 3005/3105 (mid-1990s), 6100 (late 1990s), 6200 (late 1990s/early 2000s (decade)), 8200 (late 1990s/early 2000s), 5400, 6400, 7400, 8400 (2004-2007), 5600, 6600, 7600, 8600 (2009 to 2014), 5700, 6700, 7700, 8700, (2014-2018), 3700, 4700, 5700, 6700, (global series) 5700s, 6700s, 7700s, and 8700s Today Massey Ferguson currently produces 8600 series (limited markets), 5400 (limited markets), 5700s, 6700s, 7700s, and 8700s series tractors. New generation AGCO Power engines 8700 S Series provide levels of torque and horse-power unsurpassed in conventional tractor design, from the minimum of fuel. AGCO POWER 6 cylinder 8.4 l engines generate power from 270 to 405 hp.(AGCO Beauvais France) Massey Ferguson tractor production factories also build tractors marketed by AGCO under the \\"Challenger\\" brand and also specific model ranges for Iseki. In June 2012, the Agco facility in Jackson, Minnesota, was expanded to start building Massey Ferguson and comparable AGCO \\"Challenger\\" models for the North American market. Since production commenced at AGCO Jackson, the facility has produced \\"7600\\" series and \\"8600\\" series Massey Ferguson tractors for the North American market. Currently, in production at the Jackson facility are the recently released 7700(s) and 8700(s) series Massey Ferguson tractors.

The first work in Denmark generally considered \\"Baptist\\" began in 1839 when Julius K√∂bner, a Danish Jew, visited Hamburg, Germany and met some individuals holding baptistic views. K√∂bner was an associate of and co-worker with Johann Gerhard Oncken (1800‚Äì1884), often considered the \\"father\\" of European Baptists. Oncken baptized these believers and established a church in Copenhagen in that year. Until 1849, when religious liberty was granted through the Constitution of 1849, Baptists were fined, imprisoned, and their infants baptized by compulsion. The Baptists were instrumental in the obtaining of religious freedom in Denmark. The Baptist Union was formed in 1849, and remained a part of the German Baptist Union until 1888. In that year, it was reorganized, influenced by the emigration of Danish Baptists to the United States, and the returning influence of American Baptists on the Danish. The New Hampshire Confession of Faith was adopted in place of the German Confession of 1847. A number of Danish pastors studied at Morgan Park Seminary in Chicago, Illinois. In 1918, they established their own theological seminary. Doctrinally, the Danish Baptists have evolved from a generally Calvinistic closed Baptist tradition to a more Arminian ecumenical body. Open communion has been practiced since the 1930s, and today they occasionally accept members from pedobaptist traditions. These Baptists have also changed from a membership of mostly farmers and laborers to an upper middle class membership. The Baptist Union of Denmark is a member of the European Baptist Federation, the Baptist World Alliance, and the World Council of Churches. According to the Union, membership in 2008 included 5260 members in 50 congregations.www.baptistkirken.dk: Hvem er baptister? Headquarters of the Union are maintained in Copenhagen. The theological seminary is located in T√∏ll√∏se. Baptists make up only a small representation of Christianity in Denmark, which is predominantly Evangelical Lutheran (the state religion).

He was a native of Zhaludak near Lida, and was a friend of both Chaim Soutine and Michel Kikoine. He studied sculpture at the Vilnius Academy of Art. He became a target of the pogroms because he was a Jew and fled to Paris in 1912. In Paris, Kremegne joined the group of painters of Montparnasse and soon became one of the respected residents of La Ruche. In 1915, he gave up sculpture in order to dedicate himself to painting. It was he who encouraged Soutine to come to Paris. He left Paris to live in a small town in the Pyrenees called Ceret. This village, which is a little inland from Collioure, attracted other painters such as Soutine. Although Soutine did not like the town very much, he completed many paintings there over a couple of years. He never settled but his compatriot Kremegne had a house built there around 1960. This small unassuming house, a reflection of the man himself, is nestled into the mountain and overlooks the village. There was a falling out between the two men perhaps stemming from some ingratitude shown by Soutine towards a mutual 'mecene' or benefactor who had helped out the two impoverished artists during their early careers in Paris. Kremegne's house has new occupants and it is called La Miranda del Convent. Later Ceret was to attract other painters such as Picasso. The Picasso walk meanders by Kremegne's house and Ceret has an important museum exhibiting artists such as Matisse, Picasso, and others. There are a few Kremegne paintings on exhibition there as well. Kremegne died in Ceret. Underestimated as an artist today, he is overshadowed by Soutine and Chagall. He was remembered with a posthumous one-man show in the Quartier Les Halles in Paris in the 1990s.

The Ta 152 was a development of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 aircraft. It was intended to be made in at least three versions‚Äîthe Ta 152H H√∂henj√§ger (\\"high-altitude fighter\\"), the Ta 152C designed for medium-altitude operations and ground-attack using a Daimler-Benz DB 603 and smaller wings, and the Ta 152E fighter-reconnaissance aircraft with the engine of the H model and the wing of the C model. The first Ta 152H entered service with the Luftwaffe in January 1945. The Ta 152 was produced too late and in insufficient numbers to affect the outcome of the war. Development=Fw 190 The Fw 190's BMW 801 engine was originally designed for bomber and transport aircraft flying at medium altitudes in the range. In keeping with this role it used a relatively simple single-stage supercharger that lacked performance above altitude. This presented a problem for fighter use, where high-altitude performance was desirable. Through careful tuning, the Fw 190 instead emerged as a powerful medium altitude design. Several experimental models of the 190 with different engines were tested with improved high altitude performance, but these were not high priority projects. Allied heavy bombers and escort fighters began flying operations at higher altitudes, around . At these altitudes, the 190 found itself at a disadvantage, becoming acute in early 1944 when the long range P-51 Mustang arrived in quantity. This led to the introduction of the Fw 190D-9, mounting the Junkers Jumo 213E engine. This engine had a two-stage supercharger and much better altitude performance. However, the rest of the aircraft's design, especially the relatively short wings, made it difficult to fly at high altitudes. While the D-9 upgrade was expedient, it was not ideal. High-altitude fighters Rumors of the B-29, which would cruise at altitudes at which no German aircraft could comfortably operate, added impetus for a dedicated high-altitude design. The Reichsluftfahrtministerium (German Air Ministry, or \\"RLM\\") requested proposals from both Focke-Wulf and Messerschmitt for a high-altitude interceptor. Messerschmitt answered with the Bf 109H, and Focke-Wulf entered a range of designs; the Fw 190 Raffat-1 (Ra-1) fighter would replace the existing 190D series, the Ra-2 was a dedicated high altitude fighter, and the Ra-3 was a ground-attack aircraft. These designs developed into the Fw 190 V20 (Ta 152A), V21 (Ta 152B) and V30 (Ta 152H) prototypes, all based on the 190D-9 but with varying degrees of improvement. The V20 used the same Jumo 213E engine as the Fw 190D-9, while the V21 used the DB 603E. Neither of these offered any significant improvement over the 190D-9, and further development of the Ta 152A and B was cancelled. The V21 airframe, however, was further modified as the V21/U1 and became the prototype for the Ta 152C.Nohara Shigeru 2001. Japanese version The IJAAF acquired, in April 1945, the licence, schemes and technical drawings for manufacturing the Ta 152 in Japan.\\"The Focke-Wulf Ta 152.\\" archive.org. Retrieved: 8 February 2011. During the last stages of the conflict in Germany, with the plight of the Japanese armed forces growing ever bleaker, a large volume of the latest aviation technology Germany had to offer was given to or bought by both the Japanese army and naval air arms in the hopes that it would stem the tide of defeats and ever increasing pressure by the superior Allied air forces. Design Kurt Tank originally designed the Ta 152 using the 44.52 litre displacement Daimler-Benz DB 603 engine as it offered better high- altitude performance and also a greater developmental potential. The DB 603 had been used in the Fw 190C prototypes but had many problems and was considered too difficult to implement in the Ta 152 by RLM officials. With this in mind, Tank focused his efforts on the 213E as the Ta 152H's power plant. However, he insisted that the DB 603 be retained for the Ta 152C versions and as an option for later versions of the Ta 152H. In 1944, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (German Air Ministry) decided that new fighter aircraft designations must include the chief designer's name. The aircraft design was therefore given the prefix Ta. The Ta 152's fuselage was an extended version of the Fw 190D-9 fuselage with wider-chord fixed vertical tail surfaces (especially the top half), and hydraulic rather than electrically controlled undercarriage and flaps. Due to the changes in the center of gravity and overall balance, the nose was also lengthened.Shimoda Ken-ichi 2001. The D-9 retained the wingspan of the original pre-war Fw 190 models, but this was slightly extended for the C model to , and greatly extended for the H model to , which gave it much better control at high altitudes at the cost of speed at lower altitudes. Due to the war's impact on aluminum availability, the wing was built around two steel spars, the front extending from just past the landing gear attachment points, and the rear spar spanning the entire wing. The wing itself was designed with 3¬∞ of washout, from the root to the flap-aileron junction, to prevent the ailerons from stalling before the center section of the wing. The Ta 152 also featured the FuG 16ZY and FuG 25a radio equipment (some aircraft were issued with FuG 125 Hermine D/F for navigation and blind landing, LGW-Siemens K 23 autopilot, and a heated armor glass windscreen for bad-weather operations). High-altitude features To reach higher altitudes, a pressurized cockpit was added to the H models. The canopy was sealed by a circular tube filled with rubber foam which was inflated by a compressed air bottle, while the engine compartment was also sealed from the cockpit with a rubber foam ring. A Knorr 300/10 air compressor provided the pressure, maintaining the cockpit at 0.36 atmospheres (5.29 psi) above 8,000 m (26,250 ft). To prevent fogging, the windscreen was of a double-glazed style with a 6 mm (.236 in) thick outer pane and a 3 mm (.118 in) inner pane with a 6 mm (.236 in) gap. The gap was fitted with several silica gel capsules to absorb any moisture forming between the panes. The cockpit was not pressurized in the C models. Armament The H model had heavy armament to allow it to deal quickly with enemy aircraft. It had three weapons: one 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 Motorkanone cannon centered within the propeller hub and two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons, synchronized to fire through the propeller, located in the wing roots.Hermann 1998, p. 82. The C model was designed to operate at lower altitudes than the H-model with the same armament package, while adding two more of the MG 151/20 cannons, likewise synchronized as these additional autocannon for the C-model were mounted just ahead of the windscreen, and above the engine's upper rear crankcase. The Ta 152C could destroy the heaviest enemy bombers with a short burst but the added weight decreased speed and rate of turn. Performance The Ta 152H-1 was among the fastest piston-engined fighters of the war, with a top speed comparable to the twin-engined Dornier Do 335. It was capable of at using the GM-1 nitrous oxide boost and at sea level using the MW 50 methanol- water boost.Hermann 1998, p 141. It used the MW 50 system mainly for altitudes up to about and the GM-1 system for higher altitudes, although both systems could be engaged at the same time. Kurt Tank was flying an unarmed Ta 152H in late 1944 to a meeting at the Focke-Wulf plant in Cottbus when ground controllers warned him of two P-51 Mustangs. The enemy aircraft appeared behind Tank, but he escaped by applying full power and engaging the MW 50 boost \\"until they were no more than two dots on the horizon\\".Hermann 1998, p. 12. Operational history Ta 152H, unknown date. The greatly extended wing is clearly evident in this image. By October 1944, the war was going very badly for Germany. RLM realised the urgency pushing Focke-Wulf to quickly have the Ta 152 into production. As a result, several Ta 152 prototypes crashed early into the test program. It was found that critical systems were lacking sufficient quality control. Problems arose with superchargers, pressurized cockpits leaked, the engine cooling system was unreliable at best due in part to unreliable oil temperature monitoring, and in several instances the landing gear failed to properly retract. A total of up to 20 pre-production Ta 152 H-0s were delivered from November 1944 to Erprobungskommando Ta 152 to service test the aircraft. It was reported that test pilots were able to conduct a mere 31 hours of flight tests before full production started. By the end of January 1945, only 50 hours or so had been completed. III./Jagdgeschwader 301, initially a Luftwaffe Wilde Sau unit, was ordered to convert to the type in January 1945, which it did (and flew them operationally for a short time). In the end, available Ta 152s were pooled in a special Stabstaffel JG 301, first based at Alteno Air Base near Luckau, then at Neustadt-Glewe in Mecklenburg. The Stabstaffel never had more than 15 Ta 152Hs available, both H-0s and H-1s. Since the usual transfer system had broken down, replacement parts became nearly impossible to obtain.Ethell 1990, pp. 33‚Äì34. An early Ta 152 combat occurred on 14 April 1945 when Oberfeldwebel Willi Reschke tried to intercept a De Havilland Mosquito over Stendal, but failed to catch up due to engine trouble.Reschke 1998. On the evening of that same day, Reschke was to demonstrate that the Ta 152H could be used as a low altitude fighter. A section of four Hawker Tempest Vs of 486 (NZ) Squadron were out on patrol. After attacking a train near Ludwigslust, the section split up into pairs; Wing Commander Brooker ordered the Tempests flown by Flying Officer S. J. Short and Warrant Officer Owen J. Mitchell to make their own way back to base. On the way back, this pair, which was strafing targets along the railway tracks near Ludwigslust, was spotted by lookouts posted at Neustadt-Glewe. Three Ta 152s ‚Äì flown by Reschke, Oberstleutnant Aufhammer and Oberfeldwebel Sepp Sattler ‚Äì were scrambled, catching the Tempests by surprise. Reschke recalled: It is assumed that Sattler was shot down either by Sid ShortSortehaug 1998, pp. 245‚Äì247. or Bill ShawShores and Thomas 2006, p. 486. of 486 Sqn, who claimed a Bf 109 E in the same area. Operational missions were flown in April 1945 from Neustadt, mostly escorting close support aircraft to the Battle of Berlin. Reschke claimed two Yakovlev Yak-9s near Berlin on 24 April, while Obfw. Walter Loos, claimed four air victories on 24, 25 and 30 April.Kacha, Petr. \\"Walter Loos: Oberfeldwebel.\\" luftwaffe.cz. Retrieved: 8 February 2011. The Ta 152 score at the end of the war was likely seven victories and four losses in air combat, although a degree of uncertainty about those numbers exists. Four victories were achieved by Josef Keil, from 1 March 1945 to 21 April 1945,Kacha, Petr. \\"Josef \\"Jupp\\" Keil, Oberfeldwebel.\\" luftwaffe.cz. Retrieved: 8 February 2011. and at least three victories were achieved by Willi Reschke.Kacha, Petr. \\"Willi Reschke.\\" luftwaffe.cz. Retrieved: 8 February 2011. The Ta 152 was delivered to JG 301 on 27 January 1945 and the first Ta 152 mission against American bombers took part on 2 March 1945. However, there was no contact with the enemy, and the 12 Ta 152s were forced to fend off repeated attacks by the Bf 109s of another unit. There were no losses, as the climbing ability and manoeuvrability of the Ta 152s enabled them to evade these attacks. The shape of the Ta-152 was virtually unknown to other Jagdgeschwader.Harmann 1999, pp. 100‚Äì101. The four losses in air combat were: Hptm. Hermann Stahl, killed on 11 April 1945; Obfw. Sepp Sattler, killed on 14 April 1945; two unknown JG11 pilots, downed by Spitfires in the last days of April 1945 during transfer from Neustadt-Glewe to Leck airfield.Harmann 1999, p. 107. Production The total number of Ta 152 aircraft produced is unknown.Lowe 2008, p. 38. Malcolm Lowe notes: By February 1945, all Ta 152 production had ceased.Ethell 1990, p. 33. According to Peter Rodeike, 44 Ta 152 H-0/V and 25 Ta 152 H-1 were built; total Ta 152 production is unknown.Peter Rodeike, Focke-Wulf Jagdflugzeug p.438 Variants ;Ta 152 C-0 :Pre-production aircraft, 1 prototype built powered with 2,100-hp (1566 kW) Daimler Benz DB603LA engine.

Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland, United States, where it is expected to be restored.\\"Vintage Aircraft Tool Cataloging, Re-housing and Preservation Project.\\" NASM. Retrieved: 12 March 2011. The aircraft is believed to be Werk-Nummer (serial number) 150020, which was a pre-production H-0 model transitioning to full production Ta 152H-1 series aircraft. It was probably built at Focke-Wulf's production facility at Cottbus, Germany, in December 1944, and delivered to Erprobungskommando Ta 152 at Rechlin, Germany, for service testing.\\"Focke-Wulf Ta 152 H-0/R11.\\" NASM.

He was Champion Jockey 10 times between 1914 and 1923 and was one of the most celebrated horse racing sportsmen after Fred Archer, arguably only Sir Gordon Richards eclipsing him. Background Stephen Donoghue was born in Warrington, Lancashire. His father was a steel- worker and the family had no racing connections. At the age of twelve he left home and decided to become a jockey after winning a prize for riding a donkey at a circus. Donoghue was apprenticed to John Porter when he was 14 years old, but ran away after being beaten for allowing a horse to get loose on the gallops. After working as an apprentice and work rider at two other British stables he accepted an offer to ride in France. In 1905 he won his first winner at Hy√®res, before moving to Ireland in 1907 and returning to England in 1911. Career Donoghue accepted the post of stable jockey to Henry Seymour \\"Atty\\" Persse at Stockbridge, Hampshire and had his first major successes in 1913 on the outstanding two-year-old The Tetrarch. In the following year he rode 129 winners to claim the first of ten consecutive jockeys' championships. His greatest triumphs came in The Derby which he won six times. The three consecutive wins in the early 1920s - on Humorist (1921), Captain Cuttle (1922) and Papyrus (1923) - were the high points. He was also associated with the horse Brown Jack - who he rode to six consecutive wins in the Queen Alexandra Stakes at Royal Ascot. In 1915 and 1917, he rode the horses Pommern and Gay Crusader to the English Triple Crown. In its more than two-hundred- year history, of the jockeys aboard the fifteen winners, Steve Donoghue is the only one to have ever won the Triple Crown twice. Always popular with the public and his fellow professionals, Donoghue was never called up by the stewards. He was less popular with owners and trainers because of his tendency to switch allegiance when he had the opportunity of a winning ride. Retirement He retired from riding at the age of 52 in 1937, a year in which he won two classics on the filly Exhibitionnist. Also in 1937 and appeared as himself in Wings of the Morning, Britain's first Technicolour film. Despite earning a great deal during his career his \\"impulsive generosity\\" and lack of business acumen led to financial difficulties. He took up training at Blewbury but had little success. Donoghue died in London on 23 March 1945 from a heart attack. In 1999, the Racing Post ranked Donoghue as fourth in their list of the Top 50 jockeys of the 20th century.

The convention has been in abeyance since 2011, when the Sovereign's prerogative power to dissolve Parliament was removed by the Fixed- term Parliaments Act 2011.  The letter  During public discussion of the King's potential response to the outcome of the 1950 general election, which returned a very slim Labour Party majority in the House of Commons, the Lascelles Principles were formally stated in a letter by Sir Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI, under the pseudonym \\"Senex\\" to the Editor of The Times, published on 2 May 1950: > To the Editor of The Times Sir, It is surely indisputable (and common sense) > that a Prime Minister may ask‚Äînot demand‚Äîthat his Sovereign will grant him a > dissolution of Parliament; and that the Sovereign, if he so chooses, may > refuse to grant this request. The problem of such a choice is entirely > personal to the Sovereign, though he is, of course, free to seek informal > advice from anybody whom he thinks fit to consult.

When Sir Patrick > Duncan refused a dissolution to his Prime MinisterSee: J. B. M. Hertzog in > South Africa in 1939, all these conditions were satisfied: when Lord Byng > did the same in Canada in 1926, they appeared to be, but in the event the > third proved illusory.See: King-Byng Affair and Arthur Meighen: prime > minister: second parliament I am, &c.;, SENEX. April 29. Thus, the letter asserted the constitutional power of the Sovereign to deny a dissolution, described the conditions for a valid exercise of that power, and referred to relevant precedents: occasions on which requests for parliamentary dissolution not exhibiting these conditions were refused by governors-general of British Commonwealth nations, acting on behalf of the monarch. Subsequent discussion Historian Peter Hennessy stated in 1994 that the second of the three conditions had since been \\"dropped from the canon\\", being no longer included in internal Cabinet Office guidance.The Economist, 24 December 1994, page 32 (cited in British Government and the Constitution: Text and Materials, Colin Turpin and Adam Tomkins, 2007, page 364, ) In August 2019, David Herdson of politicalbetting.com suggested the principles could still have relevance if a PM lost a vote of no confidence and then, intending to seek an election rather than allow someone else to form a government, argued a right to such an election as reason for not resigning and running down the clock.

Recording sessions for the album took place from 1991 to 1992 at Miller Midi Productions and The Tempermill Studio. The album is the first Joker's Card in the group's Dark Carnival mythology. The album's lyrics describe the Carnival of Carnage as a representation of the violence that occurs within the ghettos, which takes the form of a traveling carnival to enact the same brutality on the upper class. Carnival Of Carnage was the first album on which Insane Clown Posse collaborated with producer Mike E. Clark, who would work with the group throughout much of their career. It features guest appearances by popular Detroit rappers Esham and Kid Rock. The album features the only recorded appearances of member John Kickjazz, who left the group prior to the album's release. Although the album did not initially sell well, it became eligible for gold certification by the RIAA in 2010. Conception=Background Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler formed a hip hop group in 1990. Under the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, the group began performing at local night clubs under the name of their gang, Inner City Posse. By late 1991, the group had invested more money into production than was covered by returns. They decided that their gangsta rap style was the cause of the problem: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Bruce suggested the band instead adapt a style similar to the hallucinatory, surrealistic \\"acid rap\\" of fellow Detroit rapper Esham, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as Los Angeles represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about Satan, which Esham often did. After the change in musical style, the group decided that it needed a new name. Utsler suggested keeping the \\"I.C.P.\\" initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct, an idea to which the group agreed. Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in Delray, which became the inspiration for the group's new name Insane Clown Posse. The other members agreed, deciding that they would take on this new genre and name, and would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted hype man. Recording Carnival of Carnage began recording at Miller Midi Productions in Detroit, Michigan with Chuck Miller producing and mastering the album. Miller charged the group US$6,000 to produce the songs \\"Red Neck Hoe,\\" \\"Psychopathic,\\" \\"Your Rebel Flag,\\" and part of \\"Night of the Axe.\\" Seeing that they were being overcharged, Alex Abbiss made his first major managerial move by finding another producer, Mike E. Clark. The group finished recording the album with Clark at The Tempermill Studio in Ferndale, Michigan. Clark mastered his part of the album at Rythmatic Studio, and continued to work with the group throughout their career. Original group member John Kickjazz appeared on the songs \\"Your Rebel Flag\\", \\"Psychopathic\\", \\"Blacken' Your Eyes\\", \\"Wizard of the Hood\\", \\"Red Neck Hoe\\" and \\"Taste\\". \\"Carnival of Carnage\\" was originally recorded by Esham at Hells Doors Studio, but he pronounced \\"carnage\\" as \\"carnicks\\" and refused to redo it. The final version of the song was recorded by Joseph Bruce over a reversed recording of the original. Awesome Dre was originally going to do a verse on \\"Taste.\\" While Insane Clown Posse waited in the studio for him to arrive, Esham suggested that he appear on the track instead for the same amount of money, and the group allowed him to record a verse. Esham was paid $500 for his appearance. Kid Rock demanded a hundred more than Esham, and was paid $600 to appear on \\"Is That You?\\" He showed up to record the song intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day. Joker's Cards Carnival of Carnage is the first Joker's Card in Insane Clown Posse's Dark Carnival concept album series. The Dark Carnival is a concept of the afterlife in which souls are sent to a form of limbo while waiting to be sent to heaven or hell based on their individual actions. These concepts are related by Insane Clown Posse in a series of albums called the six Joker's Cards. Each of the six Joker's Cards relate to a specific character ‚Äî an entity of the Dark Carnival ‚Äî that tries to \\"save the human soul\\" by showing the wicked inside of one's self. { style=\\"font- size:80%\\" align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" color=\\"black\\" width=130px  } This Joker's Card is a representation of the ghettos and the violence that occurs within them.Insane Clown Posse (1992). Carnival of Carnage. Liner notes. Psychopathic Records. It takes the form of a traveling carnival which releases the same brutality on those who have ignored the inner cities' cries for help. The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government's negligence toward the lower classes. The cover of Carnival of Carnage was drawn by Joseph Utsler, who would later create artwork for the rest of the albums in the Joker's Cards series. Music=Samples Mike Clark samples Johnny \\"Hammond\\" Smith's \\"Big Sur Suite\\", from Smith's 1974 album Higher Ground, Black Sabbath's \\"The Wizard\\", from their 1970 debut album, the Beastie Boys \\"Pass the Mic\\" from their 1992 album Check Your Head, and the drum beat from Champtown's \\"Do Da Dippity\\" off his 1991/2 12\\" single Do Da Dippity, in his production of \\"Never Had It Made.\\" Joseph Bruce samples several clips from the film The Wizard of Oz in \\"Wizard of the Hood.\\" The song \\"Psychopathic\\" features a sample of \\"More Bounce to the Ounce\\" by Zapp and \\"Halloween theme\\" from the Halloween film franchise. The song \\"Redneck Hoe\\" features a sample from \\"City, Country, City\\" by WAR. The song \\"Taste\\" samples Esham's \\"Word After Word\\" from Boomin' Words from Hell and \\"Ghetto Freak Show\\" samples \\"I'd Rather Be Dead\\" from Judgement Day. Lyricism Joseph Bruce uses elements of political hip hop throughout the album. Many of his lyrics were derived from his experiences of growing up in a poor family that was neglected by the government. He and his brother Robert used to escape from their impoverished reality by gathering themselves in a forest called \\"Picker Forest\\". Joe cites \\"Picker Forest\\" as a strong influence on the Dark Carnival mythology which began with this album. The themes of the Dark Carnival also derived from a dream Bruce had shortly after the group adopted its new name, in which spirits in a traveling carnival appeared to him. \\"Red Neck Hoe\\" and \\"Your Rebel Flag\\" stem from the group's anti-bigotry philosophy, based on various experiences witnessed by Bruce. As a teenager, he had briefly lived in Bonnie Doone, North Carolina, a trailer park town just outside Fort Bragg, where his brother Robert had been staying with the U.S. Army. There, Joseph witnessed firsthand the hatred and open racism directed toward African American citizens, as well as the minorities serving in the Army, and became disgusted and infuriated with the actions that took place. \\"Wizard of the Hood\\" was originally written by Bruce sometime in the late 1980s. The first recorded version of the song appeared on the Intelligence and Violence EP under the name \\"Wizard of Delray.\\" The Carnival of Carnage version is derived from a 1991 recording which appeared on the EP Dog Beats. Release Just weeks prior to the release of their album, John left the group because he felt that it was \\"taking up too much of [his] life.\\" When Bruce and Utsler attempted to call a meeting to talk about the issues, John did not attend. Carnival of Carnage was released on October 18, 1992, with distribution within a radius of Detroit. Carnival of Carnage sold 17 copies on its release date. The number would become a reoccurring theme in Insane Clown Posse's work throughout much of the following decade. A condensed extended play featuring tracks from Carnival of Carnage was pressed on vinyl in hopes that DJs would play the songs in Detroit-area nightclubs. Reception Although Carnival of Carnage was not reviewed at the time of its release, later reviews of the album have been unfavorable. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, comparing the group's performance on the album to \\"a third- rate Beastie Boys supported by a cut-rate Faith No More, all tempered with the sensibility that made GWAR cult heroes‚Äîonly with [...] more sexism and jokes that are supposed to be street, but wind up sounding racist\\", but stating that the album would appeal to fans of the group. In The Great Rock Discography, Martin Charles Strong gave the album four out of ten stars. The album received one star out of five in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, in which Ben Sisario panned it (along with the rest of the group's discography before The Great Milenko) as \\"gangsta-inspired wigga posturing\\". Legacy During a live performance of the song \\"The Juggla\\" in 1993, Bruce addressed the audience as Juggalos, and the positive response resulted in the group using the word thereafter. The word has been the subject of criticism from both Sisario and Erlewine, who suggested the term is similar to the racial slur jigaboo. In 1997, Twiztid released a cover of the song \\"First Day Out\\" on the duo's debut album, Mostasteless. In 1998, the album was reissued by Island Records without the tracks \\"Blackin' Your Eyes\\" and \\"Night of the Axe.\\" The original version continues to be sold by Psychopathic Records. By 2010, the album had sold well enough to become eligible for gold certification by the RIAA. In the Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode \\"Juggalo\\", Bruce and Utsler appear as themselves during a trial after Master Shake commits suicide. George Lowe asks \\"Mr. 2 Dope\\" to read lyrics from \\"Blackin' Your Eyes\\". 25th Anniversary In mid 2017 it was announced that Insane Clown Posse was going to perform the album in its entirety at the \\"El Club\\" (which holds 600 people), located in southwest Detroit directly across the street from Clark Park right in the heart of ICP's stomping ground when they were younger. It was also announced that the performance would only be a one time thing, and tickets would be $250, with all proceeds going directly to the people making the documentary about John Kickjazz titled \\"The Third Clown\\". It was also said that John and Shaggy 2 Dope's little brother Tre Pound of Chop Shop would fill in for John. Later on it was announced that for the first time in 25 years Inner City Posse would be performing, and they would wear no makeup. Also a 25th Anniversary vinyl version will be available.

The fortune he amassed was based on his founding of the for-profit University of Phoenix for working adults in 1976, which is now part of the publicly traded Apollo Group. For ventures ranging from pet cloning to green energy, he has widely been described as an \\"eccentric\\" self-made man by The Washington Post and other media.  Early life and education  Sperling was born to a poor sharecropper family in the Missouri Ozarks. His father worked for the railroad and his mother was a fundamentalist Christian. He spent several years as a sailor in the merchant marine, and even as a wandering 1950s beatnik. He received his undergraduate education at Reed College, Portland, Oregon, a master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley under the G.I. Bill, and then went on to read for a Ph.D. in economic history at King's College, Cambridge. His doctorate thesis examined 18th-century English mercantile history. Entrepreneurship=Apollo Group Apollo Group () is an S&P; 500 corporation based in the South Phoenix area of Phoenix, Arizona. Apollo Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries, owns several for-profit educational institutions. Apollo was founded by John Sperling in 1973. Sperling founded the University of Phoenix in his 50s with no investors and no track record in businesses while facing what he described in his biography as \\"mean-spirited\\" opposition from accreditation agencies, competitors, and the press. The company owns and operates four higher-learning institutions: the University of Phoenix, Western International University, Axia College, the College for Financial Planning, the Institute for Professional Development. It also owns Insight Schools (Online Public High Schools for Washington, Wisconsin, and other locations), and Olympus High School. As of November 2005, the combined enrollment of the four U.S. domestic universities (UOPX, WIU, Axia, CFFP) was approximately 315,350 students. Of these, nearly 90% attend the University of Phoenix, which Apollo describes as \\"the nation‚Äôs largest regionally accredited private university\\".Apollo Group Annual Report 2004 Additionally, Apollo Group, Inc. is the owner of BPP University in the United Kingdom. It joined forces with Carlyle Group to create Apollo Global for investing in education abroad. Apollo Global also purchased UNIACC college in Santiago, Chile and ULA college in Mexico. University of Phoenix The University of Phoenix is a for-profit institution of higher learning. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Apollo Group Inc. which is a publicly traded () S&P; 500 corporation based in Phoenix, Arizona.

The school formerly had an enrollment of 420,700 undergraduate students and 78,000 graduate students, or 224,880 full-time equivalent students. The university had more than 200 campuses worldwide and conferred degrees in over 100 degree programs at the associate, bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels.University of Phoenix provides growth opportunities for working adults Lee Allen. Retrieved 18 September 2008. University of Phoenix has an open enrollment admission policy, requiring only a high-school diploma, GED, or its equivalent. The school also provides associate or bachelor's degree applicants opportunity for advanced placement through its prior learning assessment, which, aside from previous coursework, college credit can come from experiential learning essays, corporate training, and certificates or licenses. Activism Before becoming an entrepreneur at age 53, Sperling was a tenured professor at San Jose State University. He was an activist for several liberal causes during the 1960s, such as building a powerful new California faculty union, and was part of several conflicts with authorities and university leaders regarding his experimental adult education schemes. John Sperling was also an opponent of drug prohibition and was financing initiatives to decriminalize medical marijuana in the United States. According to Time magazine, Sperling used marijuana to combat pain caused by the cancer he fought during the 1960s. Together with George Soros, and Peter Lewis of Progressive Insurance, Sperling raised considerable amounts of money for drug and other related causes, especially during the 2004 presidential campaign. Bio-medical projects=Longevity research Sperling directed significant amounts of his attention and financial resources toward extending the life span of human beings‚Äîresearch into life extension technology or \\"biological immortality\\". Wired magazine reported in their February 2004 article \\"John Sperling Wants You to Live Forever\\" that his fortune was quickly approaching US$3 billion, and that he had plans to donate it to human biology research if and when he died. It was to be the biggest private program ever devoted to human biology. Sperling since indicated that his fortune would go primarily to environmental causes. Cloning Sperling provided financing to Genetic Savings & Clone (GS&C;), of Sausalito, California, which closed in 2006. He spent seven years and $20 million trying to clone a dog named Missy in a project called Missyplicity. Clones of Missy were produced in December 2007. A subproject of Missyplicity was called Operation CopyCat, which successfully created the first cat clone, named CC. Writing=For-profit Higher Education In 1997 Sperling and Robert W Tucker published a book, For-profit Higher Education: Developing a World-class Workforce. Most of the content of this book was derived from a series of internal position papers written by Sperling & Tucker (Tucker was a Senior Vice President). The papers, some 47 in all, were written from 1992 through 1997 to guide the development of the institution to serve the adult-centered market effectively. Perhaps the most controversial argument made in this book was its analysis of taxpayer costs associated to the three basic models of higher education: public, private (non-profit), and private (for-profit). By accounting not only for direct taxpayer funding associated to the three models, but also for government support to non-profits and, especially, forgone revenue in the non-profit models (including: taxes on endowments; property, sales, use, taxes; federal and state taxes on profit or surplus revenue), Sperling & Tucker's model showed that taxpayers realized a profit of several hundred dollars per student per year from a successful for-profit university. The model also showed that taxpayers underwrite costs amounting to several thousand dollars per student per year for students attending public and non-profit institutions. Sperling & Tucker's model showed that taxpayers underwrite the highest dollar value for students attending a small number of highly elite institutions, largely because of their very large tax-free endowments. There are criticisms of Sperling & Tucker's economic and financial arguments. At the time this book was published, the student loan default rate for University of Phoenix students was at or below the average for state 4-year institutions. This parity eliminated loan default costs as a significant factor in the analysis. (Although the model included default rates by institution.) Today, the default rate for-profit institutions is above the average for public and non-profit institutions, leading critics to argue that the difference in the level of taxpayer support required under the three models is not so large and perhaps does not exist. Considerable disagreement centers on this point. Some of the disagreement rests on which economic and financial variables to consider in the taxpayer cost equation; some disagreement rests on uncertainties and disputes surrounding true taxpayer costs in loan defaults. Other themes in the 1997 book include an argument that regional accrediting bodies play an inconsistent and restrictive role in innovation and an overview of the integrated assessment, academic decision-support, and quality management system developed and implemented by Tucker. Rebel with a Cause In 2000, Sperling published an autobiography called Rebel with a Cause. After reviewing Sperling's autobiography Alex Lightman wrote, \\"Sperling's unflinching honesty in recounting his childhood of poverty and illiteracy in the Ozarks; his battles over academic accreditation and 'the war on drugs;' his investments in cloning, anti-aging, and in crops that can grow amidst salt and sand; and, especially, his founding of a big, profitable public university that will probably generate more MBA holders than any other, all add up to a CEO whose life will echo, even thunder, for decades to come.\\" Lightman also wrote, \\"Las Vegas bookies probably would have given Sperling 100-to-1 odds against his business, but he not only survived, he grew the Apollo Group--parent of University of Phoenix and related interests--into a public company with a market capitalization (as of May 2001) of almost $7 billion, making it roughly as successful as many vastly more publicized dot-com champions.\\" Expressing his final opinion of the book Lightman wrote, \\"A book Like Rebel with a Cause is dangerous, because it sets new CEO standards for both searing self- reflection and for what constitutes success.\\" The Great Divide: Retro vs. Metro America In August 2004, he co-authored The Great Divide: Retro vs. Metro America, released by his newly created publishing firm, PoliPoint Press. It was a sociological treatise attempting to explain the Red America/Blue America cultural and political divisions of the United States. Despite a $2 million advertising campaign, the book was not widely embraced by its intended progressive audience. Thomas Frank, author of What's The Matter With Kansas?, ridiculed Sperling's view of American society: The book, however, did succeed in causing controversy in conservative media. Gary Gregg of National Review Online called the book the work of a \\"metropolitan elite who disdain the cultures and values of middle America.\\"Gary Gregg, \\"Metro vs. Retro\\", National Review Online, October 27, 2004 R. Albert Mohler, Jr., president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, called it a work of \\"hate, cultural condescension, and bizarre proposals backed up with hare-brained analysis.\\"R. Albert Mohler piece at Christianity.com, http://www.christianity.com/blogs/mohler/1280648/print/ The Great Divide is a blueprint for the Democratic Party to control the presidency and both houses of congress. Sperling and his co-authors claim that the United States has seldom been truly united and that there currently exists such a wide gap that the country is effectively two nations: \\"one traditional and rooted in the past, and one modern and focused on the future.\\" Sperling and his co-authors say these two nations are divided along racial, ethnic, religious, cultural, political, and geographic lines. They claim that political conflict in American is not really about left-wing or right-wing ideology but about the differences between what they call Metro America and Retro America; Metro America consists of the two coasts and the Great Lakes states. The authors argue that neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are national parties, so there is no point in behaving as such. They recommend that the Democrats concede the Retro states and focus entirely on the Metro states. This would allow the party to develop a coherent message that would connect with voters and to take advantage of the fact that Metro states account for 65 percent of the population. Then, once a strong base is built, the Democrats can work on unifying America.

It is in H√∂xter district and Detmold region. Warburg is the midpoint in the Warburger B√∂rde. Since March 2012 the city is allowed to call 'Hanseatic City Warburg'.  Geography  Warburg as seen from the Desenberg The main town, consisting of the Old Town (Altstadt) and the New Town (Neustadt) and bearing the same name as the whole town, is a hill town. While the Old Town lies in the Diemel Valley, the New Town rises on the heights above the Diemel. The Warburg municipal area borders in the west on the Sauerland and in the northwest on the Eggegebirge foothills, while in the north and northeast the Warburger B√∂rde abuts the town and in the south stretches the Diemel Valley.  Constituent communities  The constituent community Welda Warburg consists of the following 16 centres: * Bonenburg (1,107 inhabitants) * Calenberg (459 inhabitants) * Dalheim (95 inhabitants) * Daseburg (1,354 inhabitants) * D√∂ssel (651 inhabitants) * Germete (997 inhabitants) * Herlinghausen (446 inhabitants) * Hohenwepel (683 inhabitants) * Menne (846 inhabitants) * N√∂rde (780 inhabitants) * Ossendorf (1,332 inhabitants) * Rimbeck (1,603 inhabitants) * Scherfede (3,105 inhabitants) * Warburg (10,663 inhabitants) * Welda (889 inhabitants) * Wormeln (652 inhabitants)  History = Prehistory  In the 4th millennium BC, there was a megalith culture in the Warburg area.  Protohistory  In the 1st century AD, there were Germanic settlers south of the Desenberg.  Middle Ages  In the 8th century, there was a Saxon noble seat west of the town. In the 8th and 9th centuries came the Christianization of the Saxons in the Diemel area. The name Warburg was first mentioned in a document sometime around 1010, although archaeological finds have established that there were already people living in what is now Warburg by protohistoric times. The first definite documentary mention came in 1036. Old-Town Warburg with view to the Lutheran Church In the 11th century there was on the Warburger Burgberg (\\"Castle Mountain\\") the \\"Wartburg\\", under whose protection people came and settled. The castle was at first owned by Count Dodiko, whose estate, according to documents, passed in 1020 to the Bishop of Paderborn when the Count's only son met his end in an accident. Eventually, sometime between 1021 and 1033, the Emperor further granted to the bishop the Count's rights. About 1180, the Old Town was granted town rights. From the castle hill, there was a good view over the Diemel Valley, such that a close watch could be kept on the ford that merchants had to cross going to Warburg and Paderborn. This ford on the Diemel was a crossroads of several ancient commercial roads and was crucial in the town's development into a central place. The Warburg New Town was founded in 1228‚Äì29 by Bernhard IV. zur Lippe, Bishop of Paderborn, to bolster his political position in the Diemel area against encroachment by the Bishop of Cologne. About 1239, the New Town had been built into a complete town in its own right, and the townsfolk there had full civil rights after the Dortmund and Marsberg models. In 1260, the New Town was granted the right to build a town wall, not only against armies from afar, but even ‚Äì expressly ‚Äì against the Old Town. In 1364, both the Old Town and the New Town became members of the Hanseatic League. By 1436, they had forgotten their differences, uniting that year into one town. = Unification of the two towns = Plaster stamp of the seal of Warburg New Town under the constitutional document \\"Der Grote Breff\\" from 1436 The two towns, the Old Town and the New Town, joined in 1436 into one town. In Der Grote Breff (\\"The Great Letter\\"), the newly united town's constitution was precisely framed and sealed. Both former towns' seals are to be seen on the Great Letter. On the cast seal (in the picture), two defensive towers with a double wall are to be seen. Under the town gate stands the Bishop of Paderborn with a staff. The circumscription reads: \\"Sigillium burgensium in wartborch\\". The Great Letter is written in Middle Low German, the Hanseatic League's language, and stands as a substantial legal document. Town Hall Between the Towns in Warburg, built in 1568 Hitherto, the Old Town's and the New Town's council meetings had each been taking place in their respective town halls, each on their respective marketplaces. Now, however, there were two mayors. This was solved by allowing each mayor to head the unified town for half the year. Furthermore, both town halls were used for council meetings, again, each for half the year. However, the problem of having two town halls was not fully resolved until 132 years after the two former towns had merged. Only then, in 1568, was the new Rathaus Zwischen den St√§dten ‚Äì Town Hall Between the Towns ‚Äì built. The common Town Hall, in the form of preserved Renaissance buildings, was built right on the former boundary between the two former towns, with two separate entrances for Altst√§dter and Neust√§dter (\\"Old Towners\\" and \\"New Towners\\"). In 1902‚Äì03, it was expanded with a half-timbered floor. It stands right where a gate, the Liebfrauentor (roughly, \\"Gate of Our Lady\\"), once stood. In the Middle Ages, this was the only gateway between the two then separate towns. The Old Town's former Town Hall, renovated in 1973, nowadays serves gastronomical and residential ends. The New Town's former Town Hall served various purposes ranging from Town Hall cellar to assembly hall to market hall before it had to be torn down in 1803 owing to decrepitude. There arose yet another superfluous government building in 1975 after the communities of the old Amt of Warburg- Land were amalgamated with Warburg, namely the Amt administration building on Kasseler Stra√üe, which was forsaken by the district authorities in favour of the Beh√∂rdenhaus (\\"Authority House\\") on Bahnhofstra√üe.  Modern times  Matth√§us Merian: Warburgum. Engraving from the Topographia Westphaliae from 1647 In the early 17th century, Warburg was a well known and rich trading town. Outside the town walls rose \\"die H√ºffert\\" as a new part of the town. In the Thirty Years' War, great parts of die H√ºffert and other villages in the area were sacked and destroyed, impoverishing the town. In 1622, the town was captured by Christian the Younger of Brunswick, Bishop of Halberstadt, who is sometimes called in German der tolle Christian ‚Äì \\"Christian the Mad\\". By 1628, the town was changing overlords and occupation armies repeatedly as the war dragged on, ending up in Imperial hands by the time the war ended in 1648. On 5 June 1695, Johann Conrad Schlaun was born in N√∂rde near Warburg (now one of Warburg's constituent communities). Reenactment for the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Warburg On 31 July 1760, during the Seven Years' War, Warburg was the scene of a battle that now bears its name. Twenty-four thousand Prussian, Hanoverian, Hessian and British troops fought under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick and the Crown Prince of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) against a French army of 21,500 soldiers led by Lieutenant-General Le Chevalier du Muy and the Duke of Broglie. The Prussians and their allies won, killing 8,000 French soldiers while losing only 1,500 themselves, leaving them free to sack the town. A tower on the Desenberg recalls the Battle of Warburg. On 3 August 1802, Prussian troops came into Warburg in anticipation of the decisions of German Mediatisation (Reichsdeputationshauptschluss). From 1807 to 1813, in the Napoleonic Era, Warburg belonged to the Kingdom of Westphalia. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Warburg was once again assigned to Prussia. The next year, it became a district seat. In 1850, the railway from Hamm was opened. In 1892 ‚Äì 244 years after it had ended ‚Äì Warburg at last paid off the last of the debts that it had incurred because of the Thirty Years' War. In 1933, at the March elections, the Centre Party won 67.2% of the vote in Warburg to the NSDAP's 21.8%. During World War II there was a Prisoner of war camp Oflag VI-B in the suburb D√∂ssel. 20 September 1943, 47 Polish officers escaped through a tunnel. 37 were recaptured and executed by the Gestapo. On 1 April 1945, Warburg was captured by American troops. On 1 January 1975 came municipal reorganization, which saw 16 formerly independent municipalities merged into a new greater town of Warburg. Also, the districts of Warburg and H√∂xter were united, taking the latter's name. In 1983, Warburg became a founding member of the Wesphalian Hanseatic League (Westf√§lischer Hansebund).  History of the districts  Welda = The lands around Warburg's constituent community of Welda, once a border town between Westphalia, Waldeck and Hesse, have yielded forth archaeological evidence of a Celtic presence. It has been confirmed that the village was once visited in 1856 by Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, who went on to become the \\"Ninety-Nine-Day Emperor\\", Kaiser Friedrich III. He presented the church with a Communion chalice. After the Second World War, in 1945, there was an American prison camp at Welda holding roughly 80,000 German prisoners of war. = Wormeln = Likewise, Wormeln's surrounding area has yielded archaeological finds that point to ancient settlement. There is believed to have been a parish in Wormeln by about 780, with church patrons Simon the Zealot and Judah. Wormeln had its first documentary mention in 1018 in a donation document from Count Dodiko to Meinwerk, Bishop of Paderborn. About 1246, the Counts of Everstein founded the Wormeln Cistercian Convent of the \\"Nuns of the Grey Order\\" Cistercians. On 16 September 1810, J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, King of Westphalia in Napoleonic times, decreed the convent's dissolution.

Beside other places Warburg is presumed to be the location were the Irminsul, an old Saxon sacred pillar. The Austrian abbot Sturmius proselytized the area around the Diemel and Weser in 774. So the area around Warburg was Christianized from 774 on. cathoric Church St. Mary-Visitation in Warburg Old- Town = Catholic church = As most of Warburg's inhabitants are Catholic it is part of the center zone of the Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn. Many theologians as Otto Beckmann, Anton Corvinus or Julius Dammann, office bearers of the church like Johann Conrad Schlaun or Arnold G√ºldenpfennig and church artists like Josef Kohlschein come from Warburg. = Syriac Orthodox = The syriac orthodox monastery (former monastery of Dominican-fraternity) in Warburg The Syriac Orthodox Church's bishopric of Germany was founded in 1997 and has its Episcopal seat in the former Dominican monastery in Warburg. After the monastery was renovated, it is now used as the Syriac Orthodox Monastery of Mor Yacqub of Sarugh, and as a centre for the community in Westphalia. The Body of Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas is buried here.http://sor.cua.edu/  Jewish life in Warburg  The Jewish cemetery in Warburg Warburg had in bygone days an important Jewish community. Around the year 1800, roughly 200 of Warburg's 2,000 townsfolk were Jewish, and about 1900, some 300 of the 5,000 people in the town were. The sharp upswing in the population as a whole was due to migration from the countryside, industries setting up shop in town, and railway operations. In the 16th century, the Warburg family - originally from Venice - took the town's name as their own and moved in the second half of the 18th century to Altona (Hamburg), where the brothers Moses Marcus and Gerson Warburg built up the Bankinstitut M&M; Warburg in 1798. From this family also came the natural scientists Otto and Emil Warburg the art historian and cultural theorist Abraham Moritz Warburg, better known as Aby Warburg, who founded the Warburg Institute. Another well known Warburg Jewish family were the Oppenheims, among whom was Hermann Oppenheim, a famous German neurologist. Yet another famous townsman was Emil Herz, a publisher at the Ullstein-Verlag (until the Nazis forced him out as the company's director in 1934, after he had worked there for 30 years), who described in his book something of Jewish life in Warburg. There is still a Jewish cemetery in Warburg today. The synagogue, which stood in the Old Town, was destroyed on Kristallnacht (9 November 1938).

The old town's citizens first erected the connection wall of the castle to the Johannistor-Tower. Because of height of the castle mountain the Chattenturm was constructed. The round Sackturm (Saxon tower) next to the Sacktor (Saxon Gate) was erected in 1443 while the Sacktor was built around 1300. Until 1830, the town castle had about ten city towers and nine city gates. In the walls of the old town, there were five gates and four in the new town, of which only the Sacktor and the Johannistor have been preserved. Between 1801 and 1840, the other gates were taken down.

Coat of arms  Warburg's civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: In azure a fleur-de- lis argent. Warburg's oldest town seals are from 1254 and 1257, and show a bishop ‚Äì likely the Bishop of Paderborn ‚Äì standing in a gateway. The fleur-de- lis charge seen in today's arms originally appeared on coins minted in the town, beginning in 1227. Smaller town seals in the 14th century also showed the lis, with the gateway only appearing on the greater seal. For a time in the 20th century, Warburg used a coat of arms based on the old greater seal, showing the walls, towers and gateway, but not the bishop. His place was taken by a fleur-de-lis. The town, however, readopted the fleur-de-lis-only composition on 30 June 1977.Heraldry of the World: Warburg  Town friendships  * Falkenberg/Elster, Germany, since 1991 * Luckau, Germany, since 1992 * Walchsee, Austria (through the constituent community of Scherfede)  Town partnerships  * Prochowice, Poland, since 1997 * Ledegem-Sint-Eloois-Winkel, Belgium, since 1998  Economy and infrastructure  Warburg stands as a middle centre in an area shaped by agriculture. Of the two former great food producers, the Warburg canning plant and sugar factory, only the latter remains. The biggest fields of industry nowadays are automotive technology, steel and machine building, chemicals, woodworking and packaging. variety specialities of Warburg-Beer Since 1721, brewing rights have been held by the Kohlschein family, known as Warburg-Beer (german: Warburger Bier) with variety of different beer-specialities.

With the \\"Prussian Fire Order\\" in the early 19th century, even the outlying communities were obliged to lay the groundwork for firefighting. Beginning about 1850 in what is today Warburg's municipal area, the first structures of modern fire brigades were taking shape as \\"dousing and spraying teams\\". These were the beginnings of the Ossendorf and Scherfede fire brigades. After the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871), it was veterans who had the idea of setting up volunteer fire brigades after the French example of the pompiers. Thus arose the Wormeln fire brigade. In the main town of Warburg, the volunteer fire brigade was founded in 1889, and quickly thereafter, the same happened in communities throughout the Warburger Land. After the fire in Hohenwepel in 1912, they were established in D√∂ssel, Hohenwepel and Menne. Today's Warburg volunteer fire brigade was founded in 1975 by merging the town's and all newly amalgamated centres' former volunteer fire brigades.

The Church of All Nations, also known as the Church or Basilica of the Agony, is a Roman Catholic church located on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, next to the Garden of Gethsemane. It enshrines a section of bedrock where Jesus is said to have prayed before his arrest. () History The current church rests on the foundations of two earlier ones, that of a 4th-century Byzantine basilica, destroyed by an earthquake in 746, and of a small 12th-century Crusader chapel abandoned in 1345. In 1920, during work on the foundations, a column was found two meters beneath the floor of the medieval crusader chapel. Fragments of a magnificent mosaic were also found. Following this discovery, the architect immediately removed the new foundations and began excavations of the earlier church. After the remains of the Byzantine-era church were fully excavated, plans for the new church were altered and work continued on the current basilica from April 19, 1922 until June 1924 when it was consecrated.  Use by other denominations  Facade of the church with the evangelist statues An open altar located in the gardens of the church is used by many Christian denominations including followers who are Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Protestant, Lutheran, Evangelical, Anglican, and any other version of Christianity that is culturally unique to any particular nation.  Design and construction  The church was built between 1919 and 1924 using funds donated from many different countries. The coat-of-arms of twelve of the countries from which donations originated are incorporated into the ceiling, each in a separate, small dome, and also into the interior mosaics. The countries honored in this way are, east to west (altar to entrance) and beginning with the northern apse: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico; in the middle of the church are commemorated: Italy, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, and to the right: Belgium, Canada, Germany, and the United States of America. The mosaics in the apses were donated by Ireland, Hungary, and Poland (by the sculpturist Tadeusz Adam Zieli≈Ñski). The crown around the bedrock itself was a gift of Australia. These multi-national donations give the church one of its present names as the \\"Church of All Nations\\". Two types of stone were used in the construction of the church: the interior utilizes a stone from the quarries at Lifta, north-west of Jerusalem; and the exterior, a rose colored stone from Bethlehem. The building is divided by six columns into three aisles, but with an even ceiling lacking a clerestory. This design gives the impression of one large open hall. Alabaster panels dyed violet were used for the windows to evoke a mood of depression analogous to Christ's agony, and the ceiling is painted a deep blue to simulate a night sky. The facade of the church is supported by a row of Corinthian columns. Atop each column sits statues of the Four Evangelists. First is Mark. Second, Luke holds a quote from Luke 22:43‚Äì44 ‚Äú‚Ä¶factus in agonia prolixius orabat et factus est sudor eius sicut guttae sanguinis decurrentis in terram\\" or translated from the Vulgate, \\"And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.\\" Followed by Matthew holding Matthew 26:42b \\"Pater mi, si non potest hic calix transire nisi bibam illum, fiat voluntas tua\\" or translated ‚ÄúMy Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.‚Äù The final statue is of John. The columns and statues are set below a modern mosaic depicting Jesus Christ as mediator between God and man. The designer of the facade mosaic was Professor Giulio Bargellini. The bubble-domed roof, thick columns, and facade mosaic, give the church a Neoclassical look. The church was designed by Italian architect Antonio Barluzzi and is currently held in trust by the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land.

National Museum of Ethnology, Osaka The Lapita culture is the name given to a prehistoric Pacific Ocean people who left evidence of their livelihood in the Pacific Islands, by way of ceramic constructs that range in date from about 1600 BCE to about 500 BCE. Some archaeologists believe that the Lapita are the ancestors of historic cultures in Polynesia, Micronesia, and some coastal areas of Melanesia. Others believe that these are two distinct cultures that evolved separately within shared areas. The historically recognized characteristic of the Lapita culture is the distinctive geometric dentate-stamped pottery. Etymology The term 'Lapita' was coined by archaeologists after mishearing a word in the local Haveke language, xapeta'a, which means 'to dig a hole' or 'the place where one digs', during the 1952 excavation in New Caledonia. The Lapita archaeological culture is named after the type site where it was first uncovered in the Fou√© peninsula on Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. The excavation was carried out in 1952 by American archaeologists Edward W. Gifford and Richard Shulter Jr at 'Site 13'. The settlement and pottery sherds were later dated to 800 BCE and proved significant in research on the early peopling of the Pacific Islands. More than 200 Lapita sites have since been uncovered, ranging more than 4,000 km from coastal and island Melanesia to Fiji and Tonga with its most eastern limit so far in Samoa. Dating 'Classic' Lapita pottery was produced between 1350 and 750 BCE in the Bismarck Archipelago. A late variety might have been produced there up to 250 BCE. Local styles of Lapita pottery are found in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. Pottery persisted in Fiji, whereas it disappeared completely in other areas of Melanesia and in Siassi. In Western Polynesia, Lapita pottery is found from 800 BCE onwards in the Fiji-Samoa-Tonga area. From Tonga and Samoa, Polynesian culture spread to Eastern Polynesia areas, including the Marquesas and the Society Islands, and then later to Hawaii, Easter Island, and New Zealand. However, pottery-making did not persist in most of Polynesia, mainly due to the lack of suitable clay on small islands. Material culture Lapita pottery from Vanuatu, Museum in Port Vila. Prehistoric pottery vessels, including some with Lapita designs, from the island of Taumako These pots were usually created by any materials that were accessible, as well as the techniques used to make such detailed designs. The low-fired earthenware pottery, often tempered with shell or sand, is typically decorated with a dentate (toothed) stamp. It has been theorized that these decorations may have been transferred to or from less hardy media such as tapa (bark cloth), mats, or tattoos. Undecorated \\"plain-ware\\" pottery is an important part of the Lapita cultural complex, which also includes ground-stone adzes and shell artifacts, and flaked-stone tools of obsidian, chert, and other available rock, as well as the remainders of beakers, cooking pots, and bowls.\\"Lapita Culture.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica School and Library Subscribers, best modified 26 February 2016. https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lapita-culture accessed 1 November 2016. Economy Domesticates consisted of pigs, dogs, and chickens. Horticulture was based on root crops and tree crops, most importantly taro and yam, coconuts, bananas, and varieties of breadfruit. This was supplemented by fishing and mollusc gathering. Long-distance trade of obsidian, adzes, and favourable adze source rock and shells was practiced. Burial customs Excavation of a large cemetery at Teouma on Efate Island in Vanuatu, discovered in 2003, found 36 bodies in 25 graves, as well as burial jars. All skeletons were headless with the skulls removed after original burial and replaced with rings made from cone shell. The heads were reburied. One burial of an elderly man had three skulls lined up on his chest. One burial jar featured four birds looking into the jar. Carbon dating of the shells placed this cemetery at about 1000 BC.Graves of the Pacific's First Seafarers Revealed, Richard Stone, Science Magazine, 21 April 2006: Vol. 312. no. 5772, p. 360 Settlements In the west, villages were located on small offshore islands or the beaches of larger islands. This may have been to avoid areas already settled in coastal New Guinea, or malaria-carrying mosquitoes for which Lapita people had no immune defence. Some houses were built on stilts over larger lagoons. In New Britain, settlements are found inland, as well, near the obsidian sources. In the eastern archipelago, all settlements are located on land, sometimes some distance inland. Distribution Jack Golson excavation site in Vailele with a visit from a Samoan family, 1957 Lapita pottery is known from the Bismarck archipelago to Samoa and Tonga. Currently, the most eastern Lapita site is Mulifanua in Samoa, where 4,288 pottery sherds and two Lapita type adzes have been recovered. The site has a true age of circa 3,000 BP based on 14C dating on a shell. New Information for the Ferry Berth Site, Mulifanua, Western Samoa by Roger C. Green and Helen M. Leach, Journal of the Polynesian Society, Vol. 98, 1989, No. 3. Retrieved 1 November 2009 The domesticates spread into farther Oceania, as well. Humans, their domesticates, and species that were introduced involuntarily (perhaps as the Polynesian rat was) led to extinctions of endemic species on many islands, especially of flightless birds. Language Researchers suppose that the \\"Lapita people\\" spoke proto-Oceanic, a precursor of the Oceanic branch of Austronesian. However, given the difficulty of linking nonliterate material culture to languages, this attribution cannot be verified by independent sources. Origin Chronological dispersal of Austronesian peoples across the Indo-Pacific The Lapita complex is part of the eastern migration branch of the Austronesian expansion, ultimately from Taiwan some 5,000 to 6,000 years ago and reaching Melanesia via the Marianas Islands or the Philippines or both.. The Austronesian origin is supported most strongly by linguistic evidence that shows very considerable lexical continuity between Proto-Malayo-Polynesian (presumably spoken in the Philippines) and Proto-Oceanic (presumably spoken by the Lapita people) corresponding to material culture. Archaeological evidence also broadly supports the Austronesian origin. The Lapita complex appears suddenly as a fully-developed archaeological horizon with associated highly developed technological assemblages in the Bismarck Archipelago around 3,500 years ago. It has no preceding developmental stages which indicates that it comes from a migrating population and did not evolve locally, unlike earlier proposals in the 1980s and 1990s by scholars like Jim Allen and J. Peter White. Although there have been recovered artifacts and evidence of continuous human occupation of western Melanesia by indigenous Papuans dating back to 30,000 - 40,000 years ago, these were far less diverse than after the Lapita horizon. They only contributed a minority of elements to the later Lapita material culture, comprising only of a few crops and tools. The vast majority of the Lapita material culture are clearly Southeast Asian in origin. These include elements like pottery, crops and paddy field agriculture, domesticated animals (chickens, dogs, and pigs), rectangular stilt houses, tattoo chisels, quadrangular adzes, polished stone chisels, outrigger boat technology, trolling hooks, and various other stone artifacts. Lapita pottery in particular offers the strongest evidence of an Austronesian origin. Lapita pottery has very distinctive elements like the use of the red slips, tiny punch marks, dentate stamps, circle stamps, and the cross-in-circle motif. Similar pottery has been found in Taiwan, the Batanes and Luzon islands of the Philippines, and Marianas. The orthodox view, argued for by people such as Roger Green and Peter Bellwood, and accepted by most specialists today is the \\"Triple-I model\\" (standing for \\"Intrusion, Innovation, and Integration\\"). This posits that the Early Lapita culture arose through a process of Intrusion of the Austronesian peoples and their language, materials, and ideas from Island Southeast Asia into Near Oceania; Innovation of new technologies by the Lapita people themselves within Melanesia; and Integration with the pre-existing (non-Austronesian) populations.Greenhill, S. J. & Gray, R.D. (2005).Testing Population Dispersal Hypotheses: Pacific Settlement, Phylogenetic Trees, and Austronesian Languages. In: The Evolution of Cultural Diversity: Phylogenetic Approaches. Editors: R. Mace, C. Holden, & S. Shennan. Publisher: UCL Press. In 2016, DNA analysis of four Lapita skeletons from old cemeteries on Vanuatu and Tonga showed that the Lapita people descended from peoples of East Asia and came to the islands through Taiwan and Philippines. In 2011, Bellwood proposed that the initial movement of Malayo-Polynesian speakers into Oceania went from the northern Philippines eastwards to the Mariana Islands, then from there southwards into the Bismarcks. This is in place of, or in addition to, the older model of Lapita migration which proposed that Lapita settlers first arrived to Melanesia via eastern Indonesia. Bellwoods proposal is supported by the pottery evidence. Lapita pottery bears the strongest resemblance to pottery recovered from Nagsabaran Site in Luzon, which may be the ultimate homeland of the stamped pottery tradition. Lapita in Polynesia As the archaeological record improved in the 1980s and 1990s, the Lapita people were found to be the original settlers in Melanesia and western Polynesia.Andrew Pawley. \\"The Origins of Early Lapita Culture: The Testimony of Historical Linguistics,\\" in Terra Australis, volume 26 edited by Stuart Bedford, Christophe Sand, and Sean P. Connaughton, 19. 26th ed. (Canberra: ANU E Press, 2007), 1-15. Many scientists believe Lapita pottery in Melanesia to be proof that Polynesian ancestors passed through this area on their way into the central Pacific. The earliest archaeological site in Polynesia is in Mulifanua and Sasoa'a, Falefa in Samoa, with carbon dating of both sites placing the date of settlement to between 2900 and 3500 years ago. Other early Lapita discovery sites dating back to 900 BCE are also found in Tonga and contains the typical pottery and other archaeological \\"kit\\" of Lapita sites in Fiji and eastern Melanesia of about that time and immediately before.Anita Smith, An Archaeology of West Polynesian Prehistory, 2002. Anita Smith compares the Polynesian Lapita period with the later Polynesian Plainware ceramic period in Polynesia: > \\"There do not appear to be new or different kinds of evidence associated > with plain-ware ceramics (& lapita), only the disappearance of a minor > component of material culture and faunal assemblages is apparent. There is > continuity in most aspects of the archaeological record that appears to > mimic post Lapita sequences of Fiji and island Melanesia (Mangaasi and > Naviti pottery).‚Äù Plainware pottery is found on many Western Polynesian islands and marks a transitional period between when only Lapita pottery was found and a later period before the settlement of Eastern Polynesia when the Western Polynesians of the time had given up pottery production altogether. Archaeological evidence indicates that plainware pottery ceases abruptly in Samoa around 0. According to Smith: > \\"Ceramics were not manufactured by Polynesian societies at any time in East > Polynesian prehistory\\". Matthew Spriggs stated: \\"The possibility of cultural continuity between Lapita Potters and Melanesians has not been given the consideration it deserves. In most sites there was an overlap of styles with no stratigraphic separation discernible. Continuity is found in pottery temper, importation of obsidian and in non-ceramic artefacts\\".Matthew Spriggs, The Lapita Cultural Complex, 1985.

Life and career Joe Melson was born in Bonham, Fannin County, Texas, United States. He was reared on a farm until he was sixteen. He attended high school in Gore, Oklahoma, and in Chicago, Illinois, before he returned to Texas to study at the two-year Odessa College in Odessa, the seat of Ector County. He studied and played music as a teenager and fronted a rockabilly band called the Cavaliers. Beginning in 1959, first at his home in Midland, Texas, and then in Nashville, Tennessee, Melson teamed up with a Roy Orbison who had just joined Monument Records, with whom he would soon write a string of hits. Before their collaboration, Orbison had been solely a rockabilly performer. Although Melson himself was rooted in that music genre, he had begun writing rhythm and blues songs. Melson recognized the potential in Orbison's voice, encouraging the singer to explore its power through their first collaboration, \\"Only the Lonely.\\" What resulted on March 25, 1960, was the first operatic rock ballad in the history of popular music. The song went to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States and to No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, which launched Orbison to international musical stardom. Not only did that song influence Orbison to write such operatic ballads as \\"In Dreams,\\" but a few months later it also induced Orbison's friend Elvis Presley to record \\"It's Now or Never,\\" based on the Neapolitan art song \\"'O Sole Mio.\\" Melson and Orbison followed up with similar sounds such as the dramatic \\"Running Scared\\" that went to No. 1 in the US. Melson and Orbison The result of their collaborative efforts produced such songs as: *\\"Uptown\\" (1960) *\\"Only the Lonely\\" (1960) *\\"Blue Angel\\" (1960) *\\"I'm Hurtin'\\" (1961) *\\"Running Scared\\" (1961) *\\"Crying\\" (1961) *\\"The Crowd\\" (1962) *\\"The Actress\\" (1962) *\\"Gigolette\\" (1962) *\\"Blue Bayou\\" (1963) *\\"Blue Avenue\\" (1961) *\\"Lana\\" (1962) *\\"Harlem Woman\\" (1972) \\"Lana\\" was also recorded by Virgil Johnson's the Velvets, based in Odessa. Orbison released the song on his second Monument album, Crying. Between 1960 and 1963, Melson recorded several singles of his own (the best known being \\"Hey Mister Cupid\\") for Hickory Records and also through Acuff-Rose Music. wrote songs for some of that label's other artists including Dan Folger. He then recorded a few songs for EMP Records in 1964 and 1965 that achieved limited success. His last hit collaboration with Orbison came in 1963 with the writing of \\"Blue Bayou,\\" although some of their cooperative efforts would be recorded in later years. The two got together again between 1971 and 1975, but while the venture did not yield the commercial success their collaboration once had, it brought such memorable songs as \\"Harlem Woman\\". Over the years, Melson continued to perform at rockabilly and nostalgia festivals, and in 2002 he was inducted into the International Rock-A-Billy Hall of Fame in Jackson, Tennessee. In August 2014, Melson released a triple-A sided single \\"Last Goodbye/Fields of Gold/Girl Back on Blue Bayou\\" with Australian artist Damien Leith.

It is close to the town of Paihia (of which it is considered a part), 60 kilometres north of Whangarei. \\"Waitangi\\" is a MƒÅori-language name meaning \\"weeping waters\\". Waitangi is best known for being the location where the Treaty of Waitangi was first signed on February 6, 1840. It is also the place where the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand was signed five years earlier, on October 28, 1835. This document was ratified by the British Crown the following year (1836). History and culture=Signing of Treaty of Waitangi Elizabeth II in Waitangi, December 1953 The Treaty of Waitangi proper began on February 5, 1840 when a public meeting was held on the grounds in front of James Busby's residence. Lieutenant Governor Hobson read a proposed document to the 300 or so European and MƒÅori who were in attendance and then provided the MƒÅori chiefs an opportunity to speak. Initially, a large number of chiefs (including Te Kemara, Rewa and Moka Te Kainga-mataa) spoke against accepting the Crown's proposition to rule over Aotearoa. Later in the proceedings a few chiefs began to entertain the idea; amongst the more notable chiefs to support the Crown were Te Wharerahi, Pumuka, and the two Hokianga chiefs, TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene and his brother Eruera Maihi Patuone. The proceedings were ended and were to recommence on February 7; however, a number of chiefs pressed to sign earlier. The Treaty of Waitangi was initially signed on February 6, 1840 in a marquee erected in the grounds of James Busby's house at Waitangi by representatives of the British Crown, the chiefs of the Confederation of the United Tribes of New Zealand, and other MƒÅori tribal leaders, and subsequently by other MƒÅori chiefs at other places in New Zealand. Not all of the chiefs chose to sign this document, with a number of chiefs either delaying or refusing to put pen to paper. In 2007, researcher Brent Kerehona claimed that uncertainty has arisen over whether Ngapuhi chief Moka Te Kainga-mataa actually signed; despite his name appearing on this document. A close inspection of the Treaty document itself shows no evidence of a signature or 'mark' next to Moka's name (which is written as 'Te Tohu o Moka'). Kerehona elaborates by inferring that it is clear by the accounts of Colenso (1890) that not only did Moka clearly express his concerns about the Treaty's effects whilst at the meeting on February 5, but that the discussion that he had with the Reverend Charles Baker, combined with Moka's final comment, should be taken into account. The Treaty of Waitangi followed on from He Whakaputanga - The Declaration of Independence but did not render it void. The Treaty House James Busby's house at Waitangi What is now called the 'Treaty House' was first occupied by James Busby, who acted as the British resident in New Zealand from 1832 until the arrival of William Hobson, and his wife Agnes Busby. In preparation for New Zealand Centenary in 1940 the Treaty House was restored in the 1930s, and the MƒÅori meeting house was built beside it, sparking the first emergence of the Treaty into PƒÅkehƒÅ attention since the 19th century. Marae Te Tii Waitangi Marae and meeting house are affiliated with the NgƒÅpuhi hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Kawa and NgƒÅti RƒÅhiri. The upper marae grounds and Te Whare Runanga meeting house are affiliated with both hap≈´, and with the hap≈´ of Ngati Moko. In October 2020, the Government committed $66,234 from the Provincial Growth Fund to replacing all roofs at the marae.

Born at the end of the American settlement of the Plains, he became interested in the lives of those who had been a part of the European-American migration, as well as the Indigenous peoples whom they had displaced. His best-known work is Black Elk Speaks (1932), which Neihardt presents as an extended narration of the visions of the Lakota medicine man Black Elk. It was translated into German as Ich Rufe mein Volk (I Call My People) (1953). In the United States, the book was reprinted in 1961, at the beginning of an increase in non-Native interest in Native American cultures. Its widespread popularity has supported four other editions. In 2008 the State University of New York published the book in a premier, annotated edition. Biography Neihardt was born in Sharpsburg, Illinois. He published his first book, The Divine Enchantment, at the age of 19. The book is based on Hindu mysticism. Neihardt's study in Bancroft In 1901, Neihardt moved to Bancroft, Nebraska, on the edge of the Omaha Reservation, beginning a lifelong fascination with Indian cultures. He also co-owned and edited the local newspaper, the Bancroft Blade. After a trip to the Black Hills, Neihardt published A Bundle of Myrrh, romantic poetry in free verse. In 1920, Neihardt moved to Branson, Missouri. In the summer of 1930, as part of his research into the American Indian Ghost Dance movement, Neihardt contacted an Oglala holy man named Black Elk. Neihardt developed the book Black Elk Speaks from their conversations, which continued in the spring of 1931, and published it in 1932. It is now Neihardt's best known work. The book was translated into German in 1953. In the United States, it was reprinted in 1961 and there have been four additional editions. In 2008 the State University of New York Press published a premier edition of the book, with annotations.George Linden, \\"John Neihardt and 'Black Elk Speaks'\\", in The Black Elk Reader, ed.

' (, French for \\"free shooters\\") were irregular military formations deployed by France during the early stages of the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71). The term was revived and used by partisans to name two major French Resistance movements set up to fight against the Germans during World War II. The term is sometimes used to refer more generally to guerrilla fighters who operate outside the laws of war.Rupert Ticehurst, \\"The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict\\", 30 April 1997, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 317, pp. 125‚Äì134See the sections in this article Franco-Prussian War and Prisoner status and the article Hostages Trial Background During the wars of the French Revolution, a was a member of a corps of light infantry organized separately from the regular army. The Spanish word , the Portuguese word and the Italian word , meaning sharpshooter or sniper, are derived from the word . Franco- Prussian War Francs-tireurs in the Vosges during the Franco-Prussian War. Francs-tireurs were an outgrowth of rifle-shooting clubs or unofficial military societies formed in the east of France at the time of the Luxembourg crisis of 1867. The members were chiefly concerned with the practice of rifle- shooting. In case of war, they were expected to act as militia or light troops. They wore no uniforms, but they armed themselves with the best existing rifles, and elected their own officers. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica described them as \\"at once a valuable asset to the armed strength of France and a possible menace to internal order under military discipline.\\" The societies strenuously and effectively resisted all efforts to bring them under normal military discipline. In July 1870, at the outbreak of the Franco- Prussian War, the French Minister of War assumed control over the societies to organize them for field service. It was not until 4 November, by which time the (universal conscription) was in force, that the militias were placed under the orders of the generals in the field. They were sometimes organized in large bodies and incorporated in the mass of the armies, but more usually they continued to work in small bands, blowing up culverts on the invaders' lines of communication, cutting off small reconnaissance parties, surprising small posts, etc. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica describes it as \\"now acknowledged, even by the Germans\\", that the , by these relatively unconventional tactics, \\"paralysed large detachments of the enemy, contested every step of his advance (as in the Loire campaign), and prevented him from gaining information, and that their soldierly qualities improved with experience.\\" blew up the Moselle railway bridge at Fontenoy-sur-Moselle, on 22 January 1871. The defense of Ch√¢teaudun (18 October 1870) was conducted by of Cannes and Nantes, along with Lipowski's Paris corps. The Germans executed captured as irregular, armed non-combatants, essentially what also came to be called guerrillas or insurgents. The German armies and popular press vilified the as murderers and highwaymen; the insurgents seemed to have a sense of the most vulnerable parts of the German armies in France. The Germans reacted to ambushes with harsh reprisals against the nearest village or town, where they killed civilians. Whole regiments or divisions often took part in \\"pacifying actions\\" in areas with significant activity; this created a lasting enmity and hatred between the occupying German soldiers and French civilians. World War I The experiences of French guerrilla attacks and of the asymmetric warfare during the Franco-Prussian War had a profound effect on the German General Staff. During World War I, they carried out an unusually harsh and severe occupation of areas which they conquered. Hostages were regularly executed in response to reports of sniping in French and Belgian communities. The occupying German forces were reportedly very fearful of spontaneous civil resistance, which led to these arrests and executions, some of which were preemptive or at least before actual violent resistance. Most of the attacks attributed by the German occupiers to Belgian francs-tireurs were actually carried out by Belgian Army snipers. After the war, General Erich Ludendorff, Germany's chief military strategist and its commander-in-chief on the Western Front at the end of the war, tried to defend German behavior in his memoir published in 1919, the two-volume Meine Kriegserinnerungen, 1914‚Äì1918. It was published that same year in London by Hutchinson as My War Memories, 1914‚Äì1918 and in New York by Harper as Ludendorff's Own Story, August 1914 ‚Äì November 1918. In an article in the 13 September 1919 issue of Illustrated London News, the writer G. K. Chesterton responded to Ludendorff's book by remarking: > It is astounding how clumsy Prussians are at this sort of thing. Ludendorff > cannot be a fool, at any rate, at his own trade; for his military measures > were often very effective. But without being a fool when he effects his > measures, he becomes a most lurid and lamentable fool when he justifies > them. For in fact he could not have chosen a more unfortunate example. A > franc-tireur is emphatically not a person whose warfare is bound to disgust > any soldier. He is emphatically not a type about which a general soldierly > spirit feels any bitterness. He is not a perfidious or barbarous or > fantastically fiendish foe. On the contrary, a \\"franc-tireur\\" is generally a > man for whom any generous soldier would be sorry, as he would for an > honourable prisoner of war. What is a \\"franc-tireur\\"? A \\"franc-tireur\\" is a > free man, who fights to defend his own farm or family against foreign > aggressors, but who does not happen to possess certain badges and articles > of clothing catalogued by Prussia in 1870. In other words, a \\"franc-tireur\\" > is you or I or any other healthy man who found himself, when attacked, in > accidental possession of a gun or pistol, and not in accidental possession > of a particular cap or a particular pair of trousers.

Two major R√©sistance groups adopted the name during the German occupation of France during the Second World War. The first to be established was the Franc-Tireur group founded in Lyon in 1940. The second was the (FTP, Partisan irregular riflemen), which were established as the military branch of the French Communist Party (PCF). They only became active in the resistance after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Although individual communists had opposed the German occupation of France, the official Communist position was not to offer resistance, as the Soviet Union was in a non-aggression pact with Germany. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, this position changed. The PCF initially called their group the (OS); a number of its leaders had served in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War (notably, \\"Colonel\\" Henri Rol-Tanguy). A number of smaller resistance groups united in the under Pierre Villon, the former editor of the magazine . Their job was four-fold: to destroy rail lines carrying men and materials to the eastern front, sabotage factories working for the Germans, punish traitors and collaborators, and kill the occupying soldiers. \\"A librarian called Michel Bernstein became a master forger of false documents.\\" And \\"France Bloch, a young chemist with two science degrees, who as a Jew had lost her job in the French National Museum of Natural History, was given the job of making explosives.\\" Bloch was arrested by the French police and was beheaded by guillotine in Hamburg.Moorehead, Carolina. 2011. A Train in Winter: An Extraordinary Story of Women, Friendship and Resistance in Occupied France, New York: Harper Collins, pp. 64, 307. FTP became the first resistance group in France to deliberately kill a German. In February 1944, the FTP agreed to merge with the . The foreign workers' section of the FTP, the FTP-MOI (), became especially famous after the Manouchian Group was captured, its members executed, and ten of its members advertised as foreign criminals by the infamous Affiche Rouge. The Manouchian Group operated in the Paris metropolitan area, but other FTP-MOI groups operated in Lyon and the South of France, where they carried out armed resistance. Many of its immigrant members throughout the country were Jewish artists, writers and intellectuals, who had gone to France for the cultural circles in Paris. Others had taken refuge in France to escape Nazi persecution in their home countries. Alter Mojze Goldman, father of Pierre Goldman and Jean-Jacques Goldman, was a member of FTP-MOI, as was the Hungarian photographer, Ervin Marton, who achieved international recognition after the war. Prisoner status Before the two world wars, the term was sometimes used for an armed fighter who, if captured, was not necessarily entitled to prisoner of war status. An issue of disagreement at the 1899 Hague Conference, the controversy generated the Martens Clause. The Martens Clause was introduced as a compromise between the Great Powers, who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture, and smaller states, who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.Rupert Ticehurst, \\"The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict\\", 30 April 1997, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 317, pp. 125‚Äì134.

The northern soul movement generally eschews Motown or Motown-influenced music that has had significant mainstream commercial success. The recordings most prized by enthusiasts of the genre are usually by lesser-known artists, released only in limited numbers, often by American labels such as Vee-Jay Records, Chess Records, Brunswick Records, Ric-Tic, Gordy Records, Golden World Records (Detroit), Mirwood Records (Los Angeles), Shout Records and Okeh. Northern soul is associated with particular dance styles and fashions that grew out of the underground rhythm and soul scene of the late 1960s at venues such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester. This scene and the associated dances and fashions quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the Wigan Casino, the Highland Rooms, and Golden Torch (Stoke-on-Trent). As the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic in the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as Little Anthony and the Imperials and Jackie Wilson. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, popular northern soul records generally dated from the mid-1960s. This meant that the movement was sustained (and \\"new\\" recordings added to playlists) by prominent DJs discovering rare and previously overlooked records. Later on, certain clubs and DJs began to move away from the 1960s Motown sound and began to play newer releases with a more contemporary sound. History=1960s Photograph of the original release (left) and a re-issue copy (right) of Gloria Jones' \\"Tainted Love\\" The term \\"northern soul\\" emanated from the record shop Soul City in Covent Garden, London, which was run by famous soul music collector Dave Godin.Neil Rushton, Northern Soul Stories, Chapter 1, page 15 It was first publicly used in Godin's weekly column in Blues & Soul magazine in June 1970.Dave Godin. Later, Godin released \\"Deep soul treasure\\" series. \\"The Up- North Soul Groove\\", Blues & Soul magazine, June 1970 In a 2002 interview with Chris Hunt of Mojo magazine, Godin said he had first come up with the term in 1968, to help employees at Soul City differentiate the more modern funkier sounds from the smoother. Godin referred to the latter's requests as \\"Northern Soul\\": > I had started to notice that northern football fans who were in London to > follow their team were coming into the store to buy records, but they > weren't interested in the latest developments in the black American chart. I > devised the name as a shorthand sales term. It was just to say \\"if you've > got customers from the north, don't waste time playing them records > currently in the U.S. black chart, just play them what they like ‚Äì 'Northern > Soul'\\". The music style most associated with northern soul is the heavy, syncopated beat and fast tempo of mid-1960s Motown Records, which was usually combined with soulful vocals. These types of records, which suited the athletic dancing that was prevalent, became known on the scene as \\"stompers\\".Haslam, Dave, Manchester, England, chapter six, p. 147 Notable examples include Tony Clarke's \\"Landslide\\" (popularised by Ian Levine at Blackpool Mecca)Sleeve notes written by Ian Levine accompanying the CD Reachin‚Äô For the Best: The Northern Soul of the Blackpool Mecca on Sanctuary records and Gloria Jones‚Äô \\"Tainted Love\\" (purchased by Richard Searling on a trip to the United States in 1973 and popularised at Va Va‚Äôs in Bolton, and later, Wigan Casino).Haslam, Dave, Manchester, England, chapter six, p. 172 According to northern soul DJ Ady Croadsell, viewed retrospectively, the earliest recording to possess this style was the 1965 single \\"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\\" by the Four Tops, although that record was never popular in the northern soul scene because it was too mainstream.Paolo Hewitt. The Soul Stylists. p. 111, quote from Ady Croadsell The venue most commonly associated with the early development of the northern soul scene was the Twisted Wheel in Manchester. The club began in the early 1950s as a beatnik coffee bar called The Left Wing, but in early 1963, the run-down premises were leased by two Manchester businessmen (Ivor and Phil Abadi) and turned into a music venue.Haslam, Dave, Manchester, England. 4th Estate. 1999 Initially, the Twisted Wheel mainly hosted live music on the weekends and Disc Only nights during the week. DJ Roger Eagle, a collector of imported American soul, jazz and rhythm and blues, was booked around this time, and the club's reputation as a place to hear and dance to the latest American R&B; music began to grow. Pubs such as the Eagle in Birmingham were frequented by young blue-eyed soul singers such as Steve Winwood, who released songs of similar style to the early U.S. soul music. Commemorative sew-on patch similar to those worn by Twisted Wheel members By 1968 the reputation of the Twisted Wheel and the type of music being played there had grown nationwide and soul fans were travelling from all over the United Kingdom to attend the Saturday all-nighters.

Rarer, more up-tempo imported records were added to the playlist in 1969 by the new younger DJs like Brian \\"45\\" Phillips up until the club's eventual closure in 1971.Bolton Evening News \\"Marvellous Days and Memories\\" Saturday 15 March 2003 page 10Manchester Evening News \\"Where is Bobby Now?\\" Saturday 3 January 2004 page 20 After attending one of the venue's all-nighters in November 1970, Godin wrote: \\"it is without doubt the highest and finest I have seen outside of the USA ... never thought I'd live to see the day where people could so relate the rhythmic content of Soul music to bodily movement to such a skilled degree!\\" The venue‚Äôs owners had successfully filled the vacancy left by Eagle with a growing roster of specialist soul DJs including Brian Rae, Paul Davies and Alan 'Ollie' Ollerton. In America, after Doo wop boom was over, northern soul started. Motown, Chess, and Vee-Jay records were famous northern soul labels. By the mid-1960s, Motown got good songwriters and producers such as Robinson, A&R; chief William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Norman Whitfield. From 1961 to 1971, Motown had 110 top 10 hits. Top artists on the Motown label during that period included the Supremes featuring Diana Ross, the Four Tops, and the Jackson 5, while Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Marvelettes, and the Miracles had hits on the Tamla label. The company had several labels in addition to the Tamla and Motown. A third label, which Gordy named after himself featured the Temptations, the Contours, Edwin Starr, and Martha and the Vandellas. A fourth label, V.I.P., released recordings by Detroit the Spinners, the Monitors. A fifth label, Soul, featured Jr. Walker & the All Stars, Jimmy Ruffin, Shorty Long, the Originals, and Gladys Knight & The Pips. Chicago label Vee-Jay Records become a major soul label with Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, Dee Clark, and Betty Everett having hit singles on both the pop and R&B; charts. Vee-Jay was also the first label to nationally issue a record by Gladys Knight & the Pips. Vee-Jay had significant success with pop/rock acts, such as the Four Seasons (their first non-black act) and the Beatles. Vee-Jay acquired the rights to some of the early recordings by the Beatles through a licensing deal with EMI, as the American affiliate Capitol Records was initially uninterested in the group. Calvin Carter later said, \\"There was a number one record over in England at the time. The group turned out to be the Beatles and we got a five-year contract on the Beatles as a pickup on the Frank Ifield contract. Chris Norby, \\"Vee-Jay label\\", Archer2000.com. Retrieved 12 June 2020 1970s Commemorative sew-on patch similar to those worn by Golden Torch members In America, Holland-Dozier- Holland's successful acts on 70s Invictus records were Freda Payne and Chairmen of the Board. They also released Parliament's first album, Osmium. The label was distributed by Capitol Records from 1969 to 1972 and then by Columbia Records from 1973 onwards. In September 1970, the British music magazine NME reported that Invictus had the UK's top two singles. Freda Payne's \\"Band of Gold\\" was #1, while Chairmen of the Board's \\"Give Me Just a Little More Time\\" was at #3 in the UK Singles Chart. Both of those records were million-sellers in the US, but neither topped the pop or R&B; charts. Invictus had two other gold records: Freda Payne's \\"Bring The Boys Home\\" and 8th Day's \\"She's Not Just Another Woman\\", both in 1971. Northern soul reached the peak of its popularity in the mid- to late-1970s.by Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, Chapter four, Northern Soul. Section: \\"Soul Wars: Wigan Casino vs Blackpool Mecca\\", page 98 At this time, there were soul clubs in virtually every major town in the Midlands and the North of England.Stickings, Reg. Searching For Soul Some nightclubs regarded as the most important in this decade were the Golden Torch, and Wigan Casino (1973 to 1981). Although Wigan Casino is now the most well known, the best attended Northern soul all-night venue at the beginning of the decade was actually the Golden Torch, where regular Friday night soul \\"all-nighters\\" began during the latter months of 1970. Chris Burton, the owner, stated that by 1972, the club had a membership of 12,500, and had hosted 62,000 separate customer visits.Haslam, Dave. Adventures on the Wheels of Steel: The Rise of the Superstar DJs, Chapter six, \\"Leaving the Go-Go Girls at Home\\", page 170 In 1972, white soul group The Four Seasons released the song \\"The Night\\", from their May 1972 album Chameleon, a disco song which appealed to the northern soul scene, and as a result, it was successfully re-released in the UK in the spring of 1975.

Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story. Chapter one, page 14 Wigan Casino had a much larger capacity than many competing venues and ran its events from 2.00 am until 8.00 am. There was a regular roster of DJs, including the promoters Russ Winstanley and Richard Searling. By 1976, the club had a membership of 100,000 people, and in 1978, was voted the world's number one discotheque by Billboard.Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Last Night A DJ Saved My Life. Chapter four, page 99, \\"Soul Wars: Wigan Casino versus Blackpool Mecca\\" This was all going during the heyday of the Studio 54 nightclub in New York City. By the late 1970s, the club had its own spin-off record label, Casino Classics.Russ Winstanley and David Nowell. Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story. Chapter seven, page 101 By this time, Wigan Casino was coming under criticism from many soul fans about selling out the format and playing 'anything that came along'. Contemporary black American soul was changing with the advent of funk, disco and jazz-funk, and the supply of recordings with the fast-paced northern soul sound began to dwindle rapidly. As a result, Wigan Casino DJs resorted to playing any kind of record that matched the correct tempo.Ritson, Mike & Russell, Stuart. The In Crowd: The Story of the Northern & Rare Soul Scene, Chapter twenty, page 273 Also, the club was subjected to intense media coverage and began to attract many otherwise uninterested people of whom the soul purists did not approve.Haslam, Dave. Adventures on the Wheels of Steel: The Rise of the Superstar DJs, Chapter six, \\"Leaving The Go- Go Girls At Home\\", page 180 Northern soul movement between Wigan Casino's fans and Blackpool Mecca's wider approach, which accepted the more contemporary sounds of Philly soul, early disco and funk. Ian Levine broke from the northern soul mould by playing a new release by The Carstairs (\\"It Really Hurts Me Girl\\") in the early 1970s: > Back in England I found this dealer called John Anderson who'd moved from > Scotland to Kings Lynn. I told him I wanted this Carstairs record and he'd > just had a shipment in from America of 100,000 demo records from radio > stations. We went through this collection, me, Andy Hanley, and Bernie > Golding, and we found three copies of the Carstairs record. Went back to > Blackpool, played the record and changed the whole scene. Blackpool Mecca > suddenly became the home of this new Northern soul sound. I would've heard > this record in 1973, when it was supposedly released, but not obtained it > until 1974. Other major northern soul venues in the 1970s include the Catacombs in Wolverhampton, Va Va's in Bolton, the 'Talk of the North' all-nighters at the Pier and Winter Gardens in Cleethorpes, Tiffany's in Coalville, Samantha's in Sheffield, Neil Rushton's 'Heart of England' soul club all-dayers at the Ritz in Manchester and the Nottingham Palais. As the 1970s progressed, the northern soul scene expanded even further nationally. There was a notable scene in the east of England: Shades Northampton was one of the leading venues in this part of the country during the early 1970s until it closed in 1975. Later came the all-nighters at the St Ivo Centre in St Ives, the Phoenix Soul club at the Wirrina Stadium in Peterborough and the Howard Mallett in Cambridge.Ritson, Mike & Russell, Stuart. The In Crowd: The Story of the Northern & Rare Soul Scene, Chapter 19, page 263 Other towns with notable northern soul venues at this time included Kettering, Coventry, Bournemouth, Southampton and Bristol. 1980s and later When Wigan Casino closed in 1981, many believed that the northern soul scene was on the verge of disintegrating. However, late 1970s mod revival, the thriving scooterboy subculture and late 80s acid jazz movement were popular among music fans. The popularity of the music was introduced by a wave of reissues and compilation albums from minor independent record labels. Rare groove boom started in late 80s with underground DJ Barrie SharpeHuffpost, Barrie Sharpe: The Man Behind 'The Masterplan'The Daily Telegraph, \\"Whatever happened to Duffer of St George?\\"Red Bull Music Academy Daily The Dancers: In Their Own Words An oral history of the forgotten dancers that set London on fire in the late 1970s and Lascelles Gordon. Both played that brand of obscure American import records, 7\\" and albums (\\"looking back retrospectively\\"), that they had in their collection. These were bought from such specialist import record shops such as Moondogs in East Ham, and Contempo record shop at 42 Hanway Street in the West end of London, owned by John Abbey, founder of Blues & Soul magazine. The magazine also had their own record label (also called Contempo), releasing music from the 1970s which, starting in 1984, played at a club previously known as Whisky-A-Go-Go, founded by Rene Gelston in Wardour Street. Norman Jay's show was a collaboration with DJ Judge Jules and featured a mainly urban soundtrack from the 1970s and 1980s mixed with early house music. Tracks similar to \\"rare grooves\\" had begun to see a following in the 1970s northern soul movement, which curated a collection of rare and obscure soulMany of these labels were set up by DJs and collectors who had been part of the original northern soul scene. The 1980s ‚Äì often dismissed as a low period for Northern soul by those who had left the scene in the 1970s ‚Äî featured almost 100 new venues in places such as Bradford, London, Peterborough, Leighton Buzzard, Whitchurch, Coventry and Leicester. Pre-eminent among the 1980s venues were Stafford's Top of the World and London's 100 Club. Today there are regular northern soul events in various parts of the United Kingdom, such as the Nightshift Club all-nighters at the Bisley Pavilion in Surrey and the Prestatyn Weekender in North Wales.Ritson, Mike. \\"Northern Exposure\\" column in Echoes magazine. March 2009 In an August 2008 article in The Times, broadcaster Terry Christian argued that northern soul was undergoing a distinct revival in the late 2000s.\\"The Return of Northern Soul\\" Article by Terry Christian in The Times, 27 August 2008 Christian cited the popularity of regular revivals of Twisted Wheel soul all- nighters at the original venue (in Whitworth Street, Manchester) plus the Beat Boutique northern soul all-nighters at the Ruby Lounge and MMUnion in Manchester. Many of those who ceased their involvement in the late 1970s have now returned to the scene and regularly participate in such events.Stickings, Reg, Searching for SoulDavid Nowell, Too Darn Soulful: The Story of Northern Soul. Chapter 12, page 319. As of 2009, Paul O'Grady has included a Northern Soul Triple in his weekly BBC Radio 2 show. He plays three Northern soul hits, often at the request of his listeners. The northern soul movement inspired the film Soulboy (2010), directed by Shimmy Marcus, and at least one novel: Do I Love You? (2008) by Paul McDonald. In June 2010, theatre director Fiona Laird wrote and directed Keeping the Faith, a musical based on the Wigan Casino scene and featuring northern soul music. It was staged at the Central School of Speech and Drama's Webber Douglas Studio, with a revival at the same venue in September 2010. According to Will Hermes of Rolling Stone, the 2008 Raphael Saadiq album The Way I See It is an original evocation of \\"classic Northern soul\\". The music of Yorkshire singer John Newman has also been described as 'northern soul', including his No. 1 hit \\"Love Me Again\\". One version of the video for the song features stereotypical northern soul dancing. Additionally, the track samples the famous soul drum break from James Brown's \\"Funky Drummer\\", performed by Clyde Stubblefield. Northern soul music In the book Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: the history of the DJ, the authors describe northern soul as \\"a genre built from failures\\", stating: \\"... Northern Soul was the music made by hundreds of singers and bands who were copying the Detroit sound of Motown pop. Most of the records were complete failures in their own time and place ... but in Northern England from the end of the 1960s through to its heyday in the middle 1970s, were exhumed and exalted.\\"Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Last Night A DJ Saved My Life. Chapter four, page 86, \\"A Genre Built From Failures\\" Music style Other related music styles also gained acceptance in the northern soul scene. Slower, less- danceable soul records were often played, such as Barbara Mills' \\"Queen of Fools\\" (popular in 1972 at the Golden Torch)Sleeve notes written by Neil Rushton accompanying the LP Out on the Floor Tonight on Inferno Records and the Mob's \\"I Dig Everything About You\\".Sleeve notes written by Ian Levine accompanying the CD \\"Reachin‚Äô For the Best: The Northern Soul of the Blackpool Mecca\\" Every all-nighter at Wigan Casino ended with the playing of three well- known northern soul songs with a particular going home theme. These came to be known as the \\"3 before 8\\" and were: \\"Time Will Pass You By\\" by Tobi Legend, \\"Long After Tonight is Over\\" by Jimmy Radcliffe and \\"I'm on My Way\\" by Dean Parrish.Sleeve notes accompanying the LP Casino Classics Chapter One on Casino Classics Records Commercial pop songs that matched the up-tempo beat of the stompers were also played at some venues, including the Ron Grainer Orchestra's instrumental \\"Theme From Joe 90\\" at Wigan CasinoRuss Winstanley and David Nowell Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story. Chapter seven, page 109 and the Just Brothers‚Äô surf-guitar song \\"Sliced Tomatoes\\" at Blackpool Mecca.Sleeve notes written by Ian Levine accompanying the CD Reachin‚Äô For the Best: The Northern Soul of the Blackpool Mecca As the scene developed in the mid and late 1970s, the more contemporary and rhythmically sophisticated sounds of disco and Philly Soul became accepted at certain venues following its adoption at Blackpool Mecca. This style is typified musically by the O'Jays' \\"I Love Music\\" (UK No. 13, January 1976), which gained popularity before its commercial release at Blackpool Mecca in late 1975. The record that initially popularised this change is usually cited as the Carstairs, \\"It Really Hurts Me Girl\\" (Red Coach), a record initially released late in 1973 on promotional copies, but quickly withdrawn due to lack of interest from American radio stations.Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Last Night a DJ Saved My Life Chapter four, page 106, \\"Fighting for the soul of soul\\" The hostility towards any contemporary music style from northern soul traditionalists at Wigan Casino led to the creation of the spin-off modern soul movement in the early 1980s. Rarity of northern soul records Some northern soul records were so rare that only a handful of copies were known to exist, so specific DJs and clubs became associated with particular records that were almost exclusively in their own playlists. Keith Rylatt and Phil Scott wrote: > As venues such as the Twisted Wheel evolved into northern soul clubs in the > late 1960s and the dancers increasingly demanded newly discovered sounds, > DJs began to acquire and play rare and often deleted US releases that had > not gained even a release in the UK.Rylatt, Keith and Phil Scott, Central > 1179: The Story of Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club, chapter 8 \\"Bye Bye > Blues\\" These records were sometimes obtained through specialist importers or, in some cases, by DJs visiting the US and purchasing old warehouse stock.Keith Rylatt and Phil Scott, Central 1179: The Story of Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club, chapter 10 ‚ÄúThe Records‚Äù Many of the original singers and musicians remained unaware of their newfound popularity for many years.Blackford, Andy, Disco Dancing Tonight, chapter 5 \\"In the beginning\\" As the scene increased in popularity, a network of UK record dealers emerged who could acquire further copies of the original vinyl and supply them to fans at prices commensurate with their rarity and desirability. Later on, a number of UK record labels capitalised on the booming popularity of northern soul and negotiated licences for certain popular records from the copyright holders and reissue them as new 45s or compilation LPs. Among these labels were Casino Classics, PYE Disco Demand, Inferno, Kent Modern and Goldmine.Ritson, Mike & Russell, Stuart. The In Crowd: The Story of the Northern & Rare Soul Scene, Chapter 15, page 215Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Last Night A DJ Saved My Life. Chapter 4, page 102, \\"Reissues and Commercialisation\\" The notoriety of DJs on the northern soul scene was enhanced by the possession of rare records, but exclusivity was not enough on its own, and the records had to conform to a certain musical style and gain acceptance on the dance floor.Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Last Night a DJ Saved My Life. Chapter 4, page 86, \\"A Genre Built From Failures\\" Northern soul collectors seek rare singles by artists such as Holly Maxwell, Gene Chandler, Barbara Acklin, the Casualeers, and Jimmy Burns. Frank Wilson's \\"Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)\\" has been rated the rarest and most valuable northern soul single.Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Last Night a DJ Saved My Life. Chapter 4, page 109, \\"The world's rarest record\\" In December 2014, collectors were bidding in excess of ¬£11,000 for a copy of the London Records version of Darrell Banks' \\"Open the Door to Your Heart\\", thought to be the only copy in circulation. It had previously been thought that all the original versions had been destroyed when rival label EMI won the rights to release the single. Hits and favourites The northern soul movement spawned an active market in reissuing older soul recordings in the UK, several of which became popular enough to actually make the UK charts several years after their original issue. Dave Godin is generally credited with being the first UK entrepreneur to start this trend, setting up the Soul City label in 1968, and striking a deal with EMI to licence Gene Chandler's 1965 recording \\"Nothing Can Stop Me\\", which had been popular for several years at the Twisted Wheel. Issued as a 45 on Soul City, the track peaked at UK No. 41 in August 1968, becoming the first Northern Soul-derived chart hit. A few months later in January 1969, Jamo Thomas' 1966 single \\"I Spy (For the FBI)\\" was similarly licensed and reissued, hitting UK No. 44. The trend continued into the 1970s, as many songs from the 1960s that were revived on the northern soul scene were reissued by their original labels and became UK top 40 hits. These include the Tams' 1964 recording \\"Hey Girl Don't Bother Me\\" (UK No. 1, July 1971) ‚Äì which was popularised by Midlands DJ Carl Dene ‚Äì the Fascinations' 1966 single \\"Girls Are Out to Get You\\" (UK No. 32, 1971), the Elgins' \\"Heaven Must Have Sent You\\" (UK No. 3 July 1971), the Newbeats' 1965 American hit \\"Run, Baby Run (Back Into My Arms)\\" (UK No. 10, October 1971), Bobby Hebb's \\"Love Love Love\\" which was originally the B-side of \\"A Satisfied Mind\\" (UK No. 32, August 1972), Robert Knight's \\"Love on a Mountain Top\\" recorded in 1968 (UK No. 10, November 1973) and R. Dean Taylor's \\"There's a Ghost in My House\\" from 1967 (UK No. 3, May 1974). The northern soul scene also spawned many lesser chart hits, including Al Wilson's 1968 cut \\"The Snake\\" (UK No. 41 in 1975), Dobie Gray's \\"Out on the Floor\\" (UK No. 42, September 1975) and Little Anthony & the Imperials' \\"Better Use Your Head\\" (UK No. 42, July 1976). A variety of recordings were made later in the 1970s that were specifically aimed at the northern soul scene, which also went on to become UK top 40 hits. These included: the Exciters‚Äô \\"Reaching For the Best\\" (UK No. 31, October 1975), L. J. Johnson's \\"Your Magic Put a Spell on Me\\" (UK No. 27, February 1976),Russ Winstanley and David Nowell. Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story. Chapter five, page 65 and Tommy Hunt‚Äôs \\"Loving On the Losing Side\\" (UK No. 28, August 1976). \\"Goodbye Nothing To Say\\", by the white British group the Javells, was identified by Dave McAleer of Pye's Disco Demand label as having an authentic northern soul feel. McAleer gave a white label promotional copy to Russ Winstanley (a Wigan Casino DJ and promoter), and the tune became popular among the dancers at the venue. Disco Demand then released the song as a 45 rpm single, reaching UK No. 26 in November 1974. To promote the single on BBC's Top of the Pops, the performer was accompanied by two Wigan Casino dancers.Russ Winstanley and David Nowell. Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story. Chapter 2, page 37 In at least one case, a previously obscure recording was specially remixed to appeal to northern soul fans: the 1968 recording \\"Footsee\\" by Canadian group the Chosen Few was sped up, overdubbed and remixed to emerge as the 1975 UK No. 9 hit \\"Footsee\\", now credited to Wigan's Chosen Few.Russ Winstanley and David Nowell. Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story. Chapter 7, page 95 In addition, the northern soul favourite \\"Skiing in the Snow\\", originally by the Invitations, was covered by local band Wigan's Ovation, and reached No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart. These versions were not well received by the northern soul community as their success brought wider awareness to the subculture. The first domestic disco hit, \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" (UK No. 1, 1974), which was created by singer Carl Douglas and producer Biddu in Britain, was influenced by the northern soul scene. In 2000, Wigan Casino DJ Kev Roberts compiled The Northern Soul Top 500, which was based on a survey of Northern soul fans. The top ten songs were: \\"Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)\\" by Frank Wilson, \\"Out on the Floor\\" by Dobie Gray, \\"You Didn't Say a Word\\" by Yvonne Baker, \\"The Snake\\" by Al Wilson, \\"Long After Tonight is Over\\" by Jimmy Radcliffe, \\"Seven Day Lover\\" by James Fountain, \\"You Don't Love Me\\" by Epitome of Sound, \\"Looking for You\\" by Garnet Mimms, \\"If That's What You Wanted\\" by Frankie Beverly & the Butlers and \\"Seven Days Too Long\\" by Chuck Wood. Fashion and imagery Photograph of a sew-on patch featuring the clenched fist symbol adopted by the northern soul movement A large proportion of northern soul's original audience came from within the 1960s mod subculture. In the late 1960s, when some mods started to embrace freakbeat and psychedelic rock, other mods ‚Äì especially those in Northern England ‚Äì stuck to the original mod soundtrack of soul and Blue Beat. From the latter category, two strands emerged: skinheads and the northern soul scene. Early Northern soul fashion included strong elements of the classic mod style, such as button-down Ben Sherman shirts, blazers with centre vents and unusual numbers of buttons, trickers and brogue shoes and shrink-to-fit Levi's jeans.Keith Rylatt and Phil Scott. Central 1179: The Story of Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club. BeeCool Publishing. 2001 Some non-mod items, such as bowling shirts, were also popular. Later, northern soul dancers started to wear light and loose-fitting clothing for reasons of practicality. This included high-waisted, baggy Oxford bags and sports vests. These were often covered with sew-on badges representing soul club memberships. The clenched raised fist symbol that has become associated with the Northern soul movement emanates from the 1960s Black Power movement of the United States.Andy Wilson. Northern Soul: Music, Drugs and Subcultural Identity. Chapter 2, Page 78 On his visit to the Twisted Wheel in 1971, Dave Godin recalled that \\"...very many young fellows wore black \\"right on now\\" racing gloves ... between records one would hear the occasional cry of \\"right on now!\\" or see a clenched gloved fist rise over the tops of the heads of the dancers!\\" Drugs In 2007, Andrew Wilson (lecturer in criminology at the University of Sheffield) published the extensively researched sociological study Northern Soul: Music, drugs and subcultural identity. This work details the lifestyles associated with the northern soul scene and the extensive use of amphetamines (otherwise known as speed) by many involved. Wilson argues that, although many did not use drugs, their usage was heavily ingrained in the fast-paced culture of the northern soul scene, contributing to participants' ability to stay up all night dancing. Many clubs and events were closed down or refused licences due to the concern of local authorities that soul nights attracted drug dealers and users.Andy Wilson. Northern Soul: Music, Drugs and Subcultural Identity. Chapter 3, page 82 Roger Eagle, DJ at the Twisted Wheel club in Manchester, cited amphetamine usage among participants as his reason for quitting the club in 1967. Of the regular attendees he said, \\"All they wanted was fast-tempo black dance music... [but they were] too blocked on amphetamines to articulate exactly which Jackie Wilson record they wanted me to play.\\"Keith Rylatt and Phil Scott, Central 1179: The Story of Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club, BeeCool Publishing. 2001 According to Hillegonda C. Rietveld, northern soul \\"dancers were fuelled by...Dexedrine tablets\\".Rietveld, Hillegonda C. is Our House: House Music, Cultural Spaces and Technologies. Routledge, Jan. 4, 2019 Cultural legacy The Northern soul scene has had a notable influence on DJ culture, certain musicians, and has been portrayed in literature, theatre and cinema. Influence on DJ culture The Northern soul movement is cited by many as being a significant step towards the creation of contemporary club culture and of the superstar DJ culture of the 2000s.Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, Chapter 4, \\"Northern Soul: The First Rave Culture\\", page 85 Two of the most notable DJs from the original Northern soul era are Russ Winstanley and Ian Levine. As in contemporary club culture, Northern soul DJs built up a following based on satisfying the crowd's desires for music that they could not hear anywhere else. The competitiveness between DJs to unearth 'in-demand' sounds led them to cover up the labels on their records, giving rise to the modern white label pressing. Many argue that Northern soul was instrumental in creating a network of clubs, DJs, record collectors and dealers in the UK, and was the first music scene to provide the British charts with records that sold entirely on the strength of club play. A technique employed by northern soul DJs in common with their later counterparts was the sequencing of records to create euphoric highs and lows for the crowd. DJ, Laurence 'Larry' Proxton being known for this method. DJ personalities and their followers involved in the original Northern soul movement went on to become important figures in the house and dance music scenes.Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, Chapter 4, \\"From Northern Soul to Nu-NRG\\", page 113 Notable among these are Mike Pickering, who introduced house music to the Ha√ßienda in Manchester in the 1980s, the influential DJ Colin Curtis, Neil Rushton the A&R; manager of the House music record label Kool Kat Music and the dance record producers Pete Waterman, Johnathan Woodliffe, Ian Dewhirst and Ian Levine.

Terry Christian ‚Äî in his 2008 article about Northern soul for The Times ‚Äî wrote: \\"There's an instant credibility for any artist or brand associated with a scene that has always been wild, free and grassroots.\\" * Soft Cell had chart success in the early 1980s with covers of two popular Northern soul songs, \\"Tainted Love\\" (originally recorded by Gloria Jones) and \\"What?\\" (originally recorded by Melinda Marx on VJ, 1965, Judy Street 1966 and Tina Mason 1967). Soft Cell member Dave Ball used to occasionally attend soul nights at Blackpool Mecca and Wigan Casino.Winstanley, Russ and David Nowell, Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story, Part V, p. 207 * The Fall's 1981 song \\"Lie Dream of a Casino Soul\\" is about the Northern soul scene. Writer and singer Mark E. Smith said in an interview published in the NME on 1 October 1983: \\"That song actually did create quite a bit of resentment in the North because people thought it was being snobby and horrible about the old soul boys, which it was never about anyway. Because I was brought up with people that were into Northern Soul five years before anybody down here [London] had even heard about it. But they've all grown out of it, which is what the song is about, but it wasn't putting them down at all. If anything, it was glorifying them, but not in the format of, where are those soul boys that used to be here?\\" * Moloko's video for \\"Familiar Feeling\\" is set against a Northern soul backdrop and was directed by Elaine Constantine, a longstanding Northern soul enthusiast.

Literature The Northern soul subculture has spawned a number of memoirs, novels and short stories. Maxwell Murray's Crackin Up: A Tale of Sex Drugs and Northern Soul was published in 1999. Ian Snowball and Pete McKenna published In the Blood in 2012 and a volume including their All Souled Out short stories and Nightshift memoir in 2013. Both focus on the East London scene. Chris Rose's 2014 Wood, Talc and Mr J takes a more literary approach and is based on the Sheffield scene. The \\"Mr J\\" in the title is Chuck Jackson. Northern Soul also features in Nick Hornby's Juliet, Naked. Theatre Northern Soul is the title of a 2012 theatre piece by the British visual and performance artist, Victoria Melody. According to a description on the Solo Theatre website, 'Victoria, an untrained dancer, has been travelling the dance halls and living rooms of England being taught to dance by Northern Soul's ex-champions. Northern Soul draws on those investigations and explores the ‚Äòsoul of the north‚Äô using film and original Northern Soul dance moves.' Film Films set in the Northern soul scene include 2010's Soulboy and 2014's Northern Soul.

Objectives Designers wishing to give their suite of products a unique but consistent look and feel define a specification for it, which can describe choices for design aspects such as materials, colour schemes, shapes, patterns, textures, or layouts. They then follow the scheme in the design of each object in the suite. Usually, design languages are not rigorously defined; the designer basically makes one thing in a similar manner as another. In other cases, they are followed strictly, so that the products gain a strong thematic quality. For example, although there is a great variety of unusual chess set designs, the pieces within a set are usually thematically consistent. Sometimes, designers encourage others to follow their design languages when decorating or accessorizing. Industrial design In automobiles, the design language is often in the grille design. For instance, many BMW vehicles share a design language, including front-end styling consisting of a split \\"kidney grille\\" and four circular headlights. Some manufacturers have appropriated design language cues from rival firms. Software In software architecture, design languages are related to architecture description languages. The most well known design language is Unified Modeling Language. In the context of graphical user interfaces, for example, human interface guidelines can be thought of as design languages for applications.

The southern terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 90 in the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge in eastern New Orleans, Louisiana. The northern terminus is at the Rouses Point‚ÄìLacolle 223 Border Crossing in Rouses Point, New York. The route continues across the border into Canada as Quebec Route 223. US 11, created in 1926, maintains most of the original route. Until 1929, US 11 ended just south of Picayune, Mississippi at the Pearl River border with Louisiana. It was extended through Louisiana after that. The Maestri Bridge, which carries US 11 across Lake Ponchartrain, served as the only route to New Orleans from the east for six weeks after Hurricane Katrina due to its sturdy construction. The storm virtually destroyed the Twin Span Bridge on I-10 and damaged the Fort Pike Bridge on US 90. Interstate 81 (I-81), constructed in the 1960s, parallels the route of US 11 in many areas. Beyond I-81's southern terminus, other interstates run along corridors paralleling US 11, specifically I-59, which is joined to I-81 by I-40, I-75, and I-24. Route description=Louisiana Southern terminus at U.S. Route 90 in New Orleans US 11 spans within the state of Louisiana. Its southern terminus is located in Eastern New Orleans at a junction with US 90 (Chef Menteur Highway). The route begins as a two-lane highway that travels northward through a remote stretch of marshland within both the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge and the New Orleans city limits. After crossing over I-10 at exit 254, US 11 proceeds across Lake Pontchartrain on the Maestri Bridge, a span dating from 1928 that parallels the I-10 Twin Span Bridge. Midway across the lake, US 11 enters unincorporated St. Tammany Parish. Upon reaching the north shore, US 11 follows Pontchartrain Drive into the city of Slidell, where it becomes a busy four-lane commercial corridor. After a brief concurrency with Louisiana Highway 433 (LA 433), US 11 turns onto Front Street and travels alongside the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) line through Slidell's historic district. During this stretch, the route intersects both US 190 Bus. (Fremaux Avenue) and mainline US 190 (Gause Boulevard), both four-lane thoroughfares connecting with nearby I-10. Returning to two-lane capacity, US 11 crosses to the west side of the NSRW line on a narrow overpass built in 1937. At the north end of the city, US 11 intersects I-12 at exit 83, which is located just west of a major interchange with I-10 and I-59. A few miles later, US 11 enters the town of Pearl River and intersects LA 41 (Watts Road). Here, the route turns southeast onto Concord Boulevard and proceeds a short distance to exit 3 on I-59. US 11 turns north onto I-59 and utilizes the four-lane interstate alignment for the remainder of its distance in Louisiana. Following a second interchange serving the small town, I-59 and US 11 cross the West Pearl River into the dense Honey Island Swamp. Along this stretch is an exit connecting to Old US 11, a remnant of the pre-interstate alignment that provides access to the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area. US 11 crosses into the state of Mississippi with I-59 on a bridge spanning the main branch of the Pearl River just south of Nicholson. Mississippi U.S. Route 11 enters the state of Mississippi along Interstate 59, passing through several directions of trees. After a short distance, Route 11 and Interstate 59 interchange at Exit 1 with Mississippi Highway 607, where 607 ends and U.S. Route 11 takes over its northeastern alignment away from Interstate 59. Route 11 generally parallels I-59 across Mississippi, serving as a local business route and following city streets through communities such as Hattiesburg, Laurel, and Meridian Where I-59 begins a concurrency with I-20 eastbound. It leaves the state east of Meridian concurrent with U.S. Route 80, entering the state of Alabama. Alabama U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 80 split three miles (5 km) into Alabama near Cuba, with US 80 following an eastward track toward Demopolis. US 11, in contrast, continues to parallel the I-20/I-59 freeway through Livingston to Eutaw, where US 11 joins U.S. Route 43. The overlapping routes proceed northeast to Tuscaloosa, where US 43 splits from US 11 and heads north. US 11, however, continues along the I-20/I-59 corridor to Birmingham. US 11 overlaps I-20/59 for approximately between Woodstock and Bessemer. From Bessemer into Birmingham, the route is locally known as the \\"Bessemer Superhighway.\\" US 11 is co-signed with Alabama State Route 5 between Woodstock and Birmingham. US 11 through the western side of Birmingham is known as the Bessemer Superhighway and 3rd Avenue West. It passes near the Alabama State Fairgrounds, Rickwood Field (one of the oldest baseball stadiums in America) and Legion Field (known for hosting football games). On the east side of Birmingham, US 11 is known locally as 1st Avenue North and as Roebuck Parkway. West of downtown Birmingham, US 11 intersects U.S. Route 78. US 78 turns east onto US 11, forming an overlap as the roadway enters the heart of the city. In the midst of the city center, US 78 breaks from US 11, progressing south of US 11 as the two routes exit the city. East of downtown, I-20 splits from I-59, with US 11 following I-59 to the northeast. US 11 passes through Gadsden and Fort Payne before crossing into Georgia ten miles (16 km) northeast of Hammondville. Throughout Alabama, US 11 is paired with unsigned State Route 7 (SR 7). Until 1955, US 11 was routed to Ashville and Gadsden following the current routes of SR 23 and US 411, and followed Third Street and went west on Forrest Avenue in downtown Gadsden. It was relocated to its present route to Attalla, with the original route designated as an alternate route until 1963. The routes that corresponds to US 11's route in Alabama includes the Bear Meat Cabin Road (Huntsville Road), the Rome and Tuscaloosa Road (also called \\"Georgia Road\\") from Birmingham, and the Chattanooga Road (also called Alabama Road) from Attalla. Georgia After entering the state from Alabama, US 11 and State Route 58 (SR 58) travel northeast, parallel to Interstate 59 (I-59), through the valley between Sand Mountain and Lookout Mountain. The routes travel through the county seat of Dade County, Trenton, where they are briefly concurrent with SR 136\\\\. In the community of Wildwood, US 11 and SR 58 intersect the eastern terminus of SR 299 before continuing north into Tennessee. US 11 and SR 58 see an Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) of 5,000 vehicles or more north of Trenton. However, most of the route's through traffic has been diverted to Interstate 59, which closely parallels the route not only in Georgia, but also in Alabama and Mississippi. Tennessee Lenoir City US 11 enters Tennessee west of Chattanooga. The route, concurrent with SR 38 from the state line north, runs parallel to Interstate 24 for three miles (5 km) to an intersection with Cummings Highway (US 41/US 64/US 72/SR 2). While SR 38 terminates here, US 11 follows the highway east into downtown Chattanooga. At the intersection of Broad Street and East 23rd Street, US 11 and US 64 separate from US 41 and US 72 and follow East 23rd east through downtown. The routes briefly overlap with US 41, here concurrent to US 76, on Dodds Avenue before resuming an easterly progression on Brainerd Road thereafter called Lee Highway. The road is also called Lee Highway in Southwestern Virginia. East of downtown, I-24 terminates while Interstate 75 continues east along the I-24 right-of-way. US 11 and US 64 continue to the northeast, paralleling I-75 to Cleveland. In downtown Cleveland, US 64 separates from US 11, following US 74 east out of the city. US 11 remains close to I-75 as it heads north, passing through Athens, Sweetwater, Loudon, and Lenoir City before entering Farragut. On the western edge of town, US 11 merges with US 70 at Dixie Lee Junction to form Kingston Pike. The routes remain joined for just over as they pass through Farragut and West Knoxville before diverging again in downtown Knoxville. In eastern Knoxville, US 11 splits into U.S. Route 11W and U.S. Route 11E, with US 70 following US 11E. U.S. Route 11E Traversing from Knoxville, Tennessee to Bristol, Virginia, US 11E connects the cities and towns of New Market, Jefferson City, Morristown, Greeneville, Tusculum, Jonesborough, Johnson City, Bluff City and Bristol, all in Tennessee. After crossing into Virginia, it reconnects with US 11W. U.S. Route 11W Traversing from Knoxville, Tennessee to Bristol, Virginia, US 11W connects the cities and towns of Blaine, Rutledge, Bean Station, Rogersville, Surgoinsville, Church Hill, Mount Carmel and Kingsport, all in Tennessee. After crossing into Virginia, it reconnects with US 11E. Virginia SR 256 in Weyers Cave, Augusta County US 11W and US 11E rejoin as US 11 in Bristol less than a mile north of the Tennessee-Virginia state line. As Lee Highway, US 11 proceeds northeastward through Abingdon, Wytheville and Radford. In this area, Interstate 81 was constructed parallel to US 11\\\\. At Christiansburg, US 11 joins US 460 and the two routes overlap for to Salem, where the two highways split. US 11 winds through Roanoke on several roads, sometimes opposite the signed direction. Part of the Carolina Road, a colonial trail, follows the roadbed of Route 11, also known as \\"the Lee Highway\\", through Virginia. Near Cloverdale, Virginia is the historical marker: \\"This is the old road from Pennsylvania to the Yadkin Valley, over which in early times settlers passed going south. On it were the Black Horse Tavern and the Tinker Creek Presbyterian Church.\\" From Roanoke, the highway continues through Buchanan, Lexington, Staunton, Harrisonburg and Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley. (Between Buchanan and Lexington, US 11 passes over the famed Natural Bridge). Interstate 81 was constructed parallel to US 11 through many of these cities, although it generally bypassed the smaller towns. US 11 enters West Virginia about northeast of Winchester. Through the Valley of Virginia, Route 11 follows much of the former Valley Pike, a former colonial trace and important roadway during the Civil War.Valley Pike West Virginia US 11 enters West Virginia less than southeast of I-81. US 11 heads northeast for about through Berkeley County, passing through Inwood, Martinsburg, and Falling Waters before crossing the Potomac River into Maryland. The road is known as Winchester Avenue south of Martinsburg, and as Williamsport Pike north of the city. Maryland In Maryland, US 11 passes over the Potomac River into Williamsport and through Hagerstown in Washington County before crossing the Mason‚ÄìDixon line into Pennsylvania. Interstate 81 was constructed along much the same route in the 1960s. Pennsylvania US 11 and I-81 enter Pennsylvania south of Greencastle. Known as the Molly Pitcher highway, US 11 follows I-81 northeast through the Cumberland Valley, running parallel to each other as they pass through Chambersburg, Shippensburg, and Carlisle. Northeast of Carlisle in Middlesex, US 11 interchanges with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76) and I-81 in succession. US 11, now to the south of I-81, continues eastward into the western suburbs of Harrisburg as the Carlisle Pike. In Camp Hill, a close suburb of Harrisburg, US 11 stops paralleling I-81 and joins U.S. Route 15 northward through the western suburbs of Harrisburg. As the road exits the Harrisburg area, US 11 and US 15 begin to parallel the Susquehanna River as both head northward. The two routes remain overlapped to an intersection in Shamokin Dam, where US 15 branches off to the northwest, following the path of the Susquehanna's West Branch northward. US 11, in contrast, continues to parallel the main Susquehanna River, passing through municipalities such as Danville, Bloomsburg, and Berwick prior to reaching Wilkes-Barre. In Wilkes- Barre, US 11 breaks from the Susquehanna and begins to run parallel to I-81 once more. From Wilkes-Barre, the highway goes through nearby Scranton, becoming the North Scranton Expressway north of downtown. In Clarks Summit, just north of Scranton, US 11 intersects U.S. Route 6. US 6 joins US 11 westward to Factoryville, where US 11 separates from US 6 and resumes its northerly trek through Susquehanna County to the New York-Pennsylvania border. New York Northern terminus US 11 proceeds northwestward through New York from the Pennsylvania border to Binghamton. US 11 and I-81 continue to parallel each other as they head north through Cortland and Syracuse. The route continues northward to Watertown. US 11 heads northeast from Watertown, passing along the northern edge of the Fort Drum Military Reservation and traversing a number of towns and villages, including Canton and Potsdam. US 11 passes north of Adirondack Park passing through Malone. At Rouses Point, US 11 joins New York State Route 9B and heads north to the Rouses Point‚ÄìLacolle 223 Border Crossing, becoming QC 223.

It is famous for its acrobatic displays in which it spins along its longitudinal axis as it leaps through the air. It is a member of the family Delphinidae of toothed whales. Taxonomy The spinner dolphin is sometimes referred to as the long-snouted dolphin, particularly in older texts, to distinguish it from the similar Clymene dolphin, which is often called the short-snouted spinner dolphin. The species was described by John Gray in 1828. The four named subspecies are: *Eastern spinner dolphin (S. l. orientalis), from the tropical eastern Pacific. *Central American or Costa Rican spinner dolphin (S. l. centroamericana), also found in the tropical eastern Pacific. *Gray's or Hawaiian spinner dolphin (S. l. longirostris), from the central Pacific Ocean around Hawaii but represents a mixture of broadly similar subtypes found worldwide. *Dwarf spinner dolphin (S. l. roseiventris), first found in the Gulf of Thailand. The species, though, displays greater variety than these subspecies might indicate. A hybrid form characterized by its white belly inhabits the eastern Pacific. Other less distinct groupings inhabit other oceans. The species name comes from the Latin word for \\"long-beaked.\\" Description Spinner dolphins are small cetaceans with a slim build. Adults are typically 129‚Äì235 cm long and reach a body mass of 23‚Äì79 kg.Perrin, W. F, Dolar, MLL, Chan, CM, and Chivers, SJ (2005). Length-weight relationships in the spinner dolphin, Marine Mammal Science 21:765‚Äì778. This species has an elongated rostrum and a triangular or subtriangular dorsal fin.Perrin WF (1998) \\"Stenella longirostris\\". Mamm Spec 599: 1‚Äì7. Spinner dolphins generally have tripartite color patterns. The dorsal area is dark gray, the sides light gray, and the underside pale gray or white.WF Perrin, (1972) \\"Color patterns of spinner porpoises (Stenella cf. S. longirostris) of the eastern Pacific and Hawaii, with comments on delphinid pigmentation\\". Fish. Bull. (US) 70: 983‚Äì1003. Also, a dark band runs from the eye to the flipper, bordered above by a thin, light line. However, the spinner dolphin has more geographic variation in form and coloration than other cetaceans. In the open waters of eastern Pacific, dolphins have relatively small skulls with short rostra. A dwarf form of spinner dolphin occurs around southeast Asia.William F Perrin, Nobuyuki Miyazaki, Toshio Kasuya (1989) \\"A of the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) from Thailand\\". Marine Mammal Science 5(3): 213‚Äì227. In these same subspecies, a dark dorsal cape dims their tripartite color patterns. Further offshore, subspecies tend to have a paler and less far-reaching cape.WF Perrin, PA Akin, (1991) \\"Geographic variation in external morphology of the spinner dolphin Stenella longirostris in the eastern Pacific and implications for conservation\\". Fishery Bulletin 89:411‚Äì428. In certain subspecies, some males may have upright fins that slant forward.Perrin WF (1990) \\"Subspecies of Stenella longirostris (Mammalia: Cetacea: Delphinidae)\\". Proc Biol Soc Washington 103 (2): 453- 463. Some populations of spinner dolphin found in the eastern Pacific have bizarre backwards-facing dorsal fins, and males can have strange humps and upturned caudal flukes. Ecology The spinner dolphin lives in nearly all tropical and subtropical waters between 40¬∞N and 40¬∞S.Jefferson TA, Leatherwood S, Webber MA (1993) FAO Species identification guide. Marine mammals of the world. UNEP/FAO, Rome, 320 pp. The species primarily inhabits coastal waters, islands, or banks. However, in the eastern tropical Pacific, spinner dolphins live far from shore.David WK Au and Wayne L. Perryman (1985) Dolphin habitats in the eastern tropical Pacific. Fishery Bulletin 83:623‚Äì643. Spinner dolphins may use different habitats depending on the season.Fiedler, P. C., and S. B. Reilly. (1994) \\"Interannual variability of dolphin habitats in the eastern tropical Pacific. II: effects on abundances estimated from tuna vessel sightings, 1975 - 1990\\". Fishery Bulletin 92:451‚Äì463. The spinner dolphin feeds mainly on small mesopelagic fish, squids, and sergestid shrimps, and will dive 200‚Äì300 m to feed on them.Dolar MLL, Walker WA, Kooyman GL, Perrin WF (2003) \\"Comparative feeding ecology of spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) and Fraser's dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei) in the Sulu Sea\\". Mar Mamm Sci 19: 1‚Äì19. Spinner dolphins of Hawaii are nocturnal feeders and forage in deep scattering layers, which contain many species. The dwarf spinner dolphin may feed mostly on benthic fish in reefs and shallow water. Off Oahu, Hawaii, spinner dolphins forage at night and cooperatively herd their prey into highly dense patches.Benoit-Bird K, Au W (2003) \\"Hawaiian spinner dolphins aggregate midwater food resources through cooperative foraging\\". Acoust Soc Am 114: 2300. They swim around the prey in a circle and a pair may swim through the circle to make a catch. Spinner dolphins are in turn preyed on by sharks. Other possible predators include the killer whale, the false killer whale, the pygmy killer whale and the short-finned pilot whale.Norris KS, W√ºrsig B, Wells RS, W√ºrsig M (1994) The Hawaiian spinner dolphin. U Cal Press, Berkeley, Cal., USA. They are susceptible to parasites, and are known to exhibit both external ones like barnacles and remoras, and internal ones, like nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans. Behavior and life history In certain regions, such as Hawaii and northern Brazil, dolphins spend the daytime resting in shallow bays near deep water. At dusk, they travel offshore to feed. They travel along the shore during foraging trips, and the individuals that occupy the same bay may change daily.Wursig B, Wells RS, Norris KS W√ºrsig M, \\"A spinner dolphins day\\" pp. 65‚Äì102. in: Norris KS, W√ºrsig B, Wells RS, W√ºrsig M (1994) The Hawaiian spinner dolphin. U Cal Press, Berkeley, Cal., USA. Some individual dolphins do not always go to a bay to rest; however, in Hawaii, dolphins do seem to return to the same site each trip.Marten K, Psarakos S (1999) \\"Long-term site fidelity and possible long-term associations of wild spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) seen off Oahu, Hawaii\\". Mar Mamm Sci 15: 1329-1336. Spinner dolphins live in an open and loose social organization.Norris KS, Johnson CM, Schools and schooling, pp 234-242 in Norris KS, W√ºrsig B, Wells RS, W√ºrsig M (1994) The Hawaiian spinner dolphin. U Cal Press, Berkeley, Cal., USA. The spinner dolphins of Hawaii live in family groups, but also have associations with others beyond their groups. Mothers and calves form strong social bonds. Spinner dolphins seem to have a promiscuous mating system, with individuals changing partners for up to some weeks. A dozen adult males may gather into coalitions. Vocalizations of spinner dolphins include whistles, which may be used to organize the school, burst-pulse signals, and echolocation clicks.Brownlee SM, Norris KS. \\"The acoustic domain\\" in Norris KS, W√ºrsig B, Wells RS, W√ºrsig M (1994) The Hawaiian spinner dolphin. U Cal Press, Berkeley, Cal., USA. The spinner dolphin has a 10-month gestation period, and mothers nurse their young for one to two years. Females are sexually mature at four to seven years, with three-year calving intervals, while males are sexually mature at seven to 10 years. Breeding is seasonal, more so in certain regions than others. Spinning behavior Spinner dolphins are known for their acrobatics and aerial behaviors. A spinner dolphin comes out of the water front first and twists its body as it rises into the air.Frank E Fish, Anthony J Nicastro, Daniel Weihs (2006) \\"Dynamics of the aerial maneuvers of spinner dolphins\\", Journal of Experimental Biology. When it reaches its maximum height, the dolphin descends back into the water, landing on its side. A dolphin can make two to 5.5 spins in one leap; the swimming and rotational speed of the dolphin as it spins underwater affects the number of spins it can do while airborne. These spins may serve several functions. Dolphins may also make nose-outs, tail slaps, flips, head slaps, \\"salmon leaps\\", and side and back slaps. Conservation status Tens of thousands of spinner dolphins, mostly eastern and white-bellied varieties, were killed in the 30 years after purse seine fishing for tuna began in the 1950s. The process killed probably half of all eastern spinner dolphins. They have also been contaminated by pollutants such as DDT and PCBs. Spinner dolphins, as with other species affected by ETP tuna purse-seine fishing, are managed nationally by the coastal countries and internationally by the IATTC. The IATTC has imposed annual stock mortality limits on each purse seine and promulgated regulations regarding the safe release of dolphins. The eastern tropical Pacific and Southeast Asian populations of the spinner dolphin are listed on Appendix II\\"Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009. of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), since they have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements. In addition, the spinner dolphin is covered by Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU). Spinner dolphins in Hawaii receive multiple daily visits to their near-shore resting grounds, with boats taking people out daily to snorkel and interact with the local dolphin population. Such activities are increasingly coming under criticism on the grounds of possible harm to the dolphins, and efforts are being made both to educate the public in order to minimise human impact on the dolphins, and to bring in regulations to govern these activities.

A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm. The algorithm depends on efficient estimation of the lower and upper bounds of regions/branches of the search space. If no bounds are available, the algorithm degenerates to an exhaustive search. The method was first proposed by Ailsa Land and Alison Doig whilst carrying out research at the London School of Economics sponsored by British Petroleum in 1960 for discrete programming, and has become the most commonly used tool for solving NP-hard optimization problems. The name \\"branch and bound\\" first occurred in the work of Little et al. on the traveling salesman problem. Overview The goal of a branch-and-bound algorithm is to find a value that maximizes or minimizes the value of a real-valued function , called an objective function, among some set of admissible, or candidate solutions. The set is called the search space, or feasible region. The rest of this section assumes that minimization of is desired; this assumption comes without loss of generality, since one can find the maximum value of by finding the minimum of . A B&B; algorithm operates according to two principles: * It recursively splits the search space into smaller spaces, then minimizing on these smaller spaces; the splitting is called branching. * Branching alone would amount to brute-force enumeration of candidate solutions and testing them all. To improve on the performance of brute-force search, a B&B; algorithm keeps track of bounds on the minimum that it is trying to find, and uses these bounds to \\"prune\\" the search space, eliminating candidate solutions that it can prove will not contain an optimal solution. Turning these principles into a concrete algorithm for a specific optimization problem requires some kind of data structure that represents sets of candidate solutions. Such a representation is called an instance of the problem. Denote the set of candidate solutions of an instance by . The instance representation has to come with three operations: * produces two or more instances that each represent a subset of . (Typically, the subsets are disjoint to prevent the algorithm from visiting the same candidate solution twice, but this is not required. However, the optimal solution among must be contained in at least one of the subsets.) * computes a lower bound on the value of any candidate solution in the space represented by , that is, for all in . * determines whether represents a single candidate solution. (Optionally, if it does not, the operation may choose to return some feasible solution from among .) If returns a solution then provides an upper bound for the optimal objective value over the whole space of feasible solutions. Using these operations, a B&B; algorithm performs a top-down recursive search through the tree of instances formed by the branch operation. Upon visiting an instance , it checks whether is greater than an upper bound found so far; if so, may be safely discarded from the search and the recursion stops. This pruning step is usually implemented by maintaining a global variable that records the minimum upper bound seen among all instances examined so far. Generic version The following is the skeleton of a generic branch and bound algorithm for minimizing an arbitrary objective function . To obtain an actual algorithm from this, one requires a bounding function , that computes lower bounds of on nodes of the search tree, as well as a problem-specific branching rule. As such, the generic algorithm presented here is a higher order function. # Using a heuristic, find a solution to the optimization problem. Store its value, . (If no heuristic is available, set to infinity.) will denote the best solution found so far, and will be used as an upper bound on candidate solutions. # Initialize a queue to hold a partial solution with none of the variables of the problem assigned. # Loop until the queue is empty: ## Take a node off the queue. ## If represents a single candidate solution and , then is the best solution so far. Record it and set . ## Else, branch on to produce new nodes . For each of these: ### If , do nothing; since the lower bound on this node is greater than the upper bound of the problem, it will never lead to the optimal solution, and can be discarded. ### Else, store on the queue. Several different queue data structures can be used. This FIFO queue-based implementation yields a breadth-first search. A stack (LIFO queue) will yield a depth-first algorithm. A best-first branch and bound algorithm can be obtained by using a priority queue that sorts nodes on their lower bound. Examples of best-first search algorithms with this premise are Dijkstra's algorithm and its descendant A* search. The depth-first variant is recommended when no good heuristic is available for producing an initial solution, because it quickly produces full solutions, and therefore upper bounds. = Pseudocode = A C++-like pseudocode implementation of the above is: // C++-like implementation of branch and bound, // assuming the objective function f is to be minimized CombinatorialSolution branch_and_bound_solve( CombinatorialProblem problem, ObjectiveFunction objective_function /*f*/, BoundingFunction lower_bound_function /*bound*/) { // Step 1 above double problem_upper_bound = std::numeric_limits::infinity; // = B CombinatorialSolution heuristic_solution = heuristic_solve(problem); // x_h problem_upper_bound = objective_function(heuristic_solution); // B = f(x_h) CombinatorialSolution current_optimum = heuristic_solution; // Step 2 above queue candidate_queue; // problem-specific queue initialization candidate_queue = populate_candidates(problem); while (!candidate_queue.empty()) { // Step 3 above // Step 3.1 CandidateSolutionTree node = candidate_queue.pop(); // \\"node\\" represents N above if (node.represents_single_candidate()) { // Step 3.2 if (objective_function(node.candidate()) < problem_upper_bound) { current_optimum = node.candidate(); problem_upper_bound = objective_function(current_optimum); } // else, node is a single candidate which is not optimum } else { // Step 3.3: node represents a branch of candidate solutions // \\"child_branch\\" represents N_i above for (auto&& child_branch : node.candidate_nodes) { if (lower_bound_function(child_branch) <= problem_upper_bound) { candidate_queue.enqueue(child_branch); // Step 3.3.2 } // otherwise, bound(N_i) > B so we prune the branch; step 3.3.1 } } } return current_optimum; } In the above pseudocode, the functions \`heuristic_solve\` and \`populate_candidates\` called as subroutines must be provided as applicable to the problem. The functions (\`objective_function\`) and (\`lower_bound_function\`) are treated as function objects as written, and could correspond to lambda expressions, function pointers or functors in the C++ programming language, among other types of callable objects. Improvements When \\\\mathbf{x} is a vector of \\\\mathbb{R}^n, branch and bound algorithms can be combined with interval analysis and contractor techniques in order to provide guaranteed enclosures of the global minimum. Applications This approach is used for a number of NP-hard problems * Integer programming * Nonlinear programming * Travelling salesman problem (TSP) * Quadratic assignment problem (QAP) * Maximum satisfiability problem (MAX-SAT) * Nearest neighbor search (by Keinosuke Fukunaga) * Flow shop scheduling * Cutting stock problem * False noise analysis (FNA) * Computational phylogenetics * Set inversion * Parameter estimation * 0/1 knapsack problem * Feature selection in machine learning * Structured prediction in computer vision Branch-and-bound may also be a base of various heuristics. For example, one may wish to stop branching when the gap between the upper and lower bounds becomes smaller than a certain threshold. This is used when the solution is \\"good enough for practical purposes\\" and can greatly reduce the computations required. This type of solution is particularly applicable when the cost function used is noisy or is the result of statistical estimates and so is not known precisely but rather only known to lie within a range of values with a specific probability.

Set in Toronto during the early 1980s, it follows the CEO of a small UHF television station who stumbles upon a broadcast signal featuring violence and torture. The layers of deception and mind-control conspiracy unfold as he uncovers the signal's source, and loses touch with reality in a series of increasingly bizarre hallucinations. Distributed by Universal Pictures, Videodrome was the first film by Cronenberg to gain backing from any major Hollywood studio. With the highest budget of any of his films to date, the film was a box-office bomb, recouping only $2.1 million from a $5.9 million budget. The film received praise for the special makeup effects, Cronenberg's direction, Woods and Harry's performances, its \\"techno-surrealist\\" aesthetic, and its cryptic, psychosexual themes. Cronenberg won the Best Direction award and was nominated for seven other awards at the 5th Genie Awards. Now considered a cult classic, the film has been cited as one of Cronenberg's best, and a key example of the body horror and science fiction horror genres. The film's trailer Plot Max Renn is the president of CIVIC-TV, a Toronto UHF television station specializing in sensationalist programming. Harlan, the operator of CIVIC-TV's unauthorized satellite dish, shows Max Videodrome, a plotless show apparently being broadcast from Malaysia which depicts the violent torture and eventual murder of anonymous victims. Believing this to be the future of television, Max orders Harlan to begin unlicensed use of the show. Nicki Brand, a sadomasochistic radio host who becomes sexually involved with Max, is aroused by an episode of Videodrome, and goes to audition for the show when she learns that it is being broadcast out of Pittsburgh, but never returns. Max contacts Masha, a softcore pornographer, and asks her to help him find out the truth about Videodrome. Through Masha, Max learns that not only is the footage not faked, but it is the public \\"face\\" of a political movement. Masha further informs him that the enigmatic media theorist Brian O'Blivion knows about Videodrome. Max tracks down O'Blivion to a homeless shelter where vagrants are encouraged to engage in marathon sessions of television viewing. He discovers the mission is run by O'Blivion's daughter, Bianca, with the goal of helping to bring about her father's vision of a world in which television replaces every aspect of everyday life. Later, Max views a videotape in which O'Blivion informs him that Videodrome is a socio-political battleground in which a war is being fought for control of the minds of the people of North America. Shortly thereafter, Max begins experiencing hallucinations in which a rash on his torso transforms into a gaping hole that functions as a videocassette recorder. Bianca tells him these are side-effects from having viewed Videodrome, which carries a broadcast signal that causes the viewer to develop a malignant brain tumor. O'Blivion helped to create it as part of his vision for the future, and viewed the hallucinations as a higher form of reality. When he found out it was to be used for malevolent purposes, he attempted to stop his partners; they used his own invention to kill him. In the year before his death, O'Blivion recorded tens of thousands of videos, which now form the basis of his television appearances. Max is contacted by Videodromes producer, the Spectacular Optical Corporation; an eyeglasses company that acts as a front for an arms company. The head of Spectacular Optical, Barry Convex, has been secretly working with Harlan to get Max exposed to Videodrome and to have him broadcast it, as part of a conspiracy to end North America's cultural decay by giving fatal brain tumours to anyone obsessed enough with sex and violence who would watch Videodrome. Convex then inserts a brainwashing Betamax tape into Max's torso. Under Convex's influence, Max murders his colleagues at CIVIC-TV, and later attempts to murder Bianca, but she manages to stop Max by showing him a videotape of Nicki being strangled to death. Bianca then 'reprograms' Max to kill Harlan and Convex on her orders. After doing so, he takes refuge on a derelict boat, where Nicki appears to him on a television. She tells him he has weakened Videodrome, but in order to completely defeat it, he must ascend to the next level and \\"leave the old flesh\\". The television then shows an image of Max shooting himself in the head, which causes the set to explode. Reenacting what he has just seen on the television, Max utters the words \\"Long live the new flesh\\" and shoots himself. CastProduction= Development  The basis for the film came from David Cronenberg's childhood. Cronenberg used to pick up television signals from Buffalo, New York, late at night after Canadian stations had gone off the air, and worry he might see something disturbing not meant for public consumption.Cronenberg, David. Director's commentary, Videodrome, Criterion Collection DVD. As a young man, Cronenberg attended the University of Toronto; first studying science, but eventually gaining his degree in Literature. Marshall McLuhan was a lecturer in media studies at the University during the same time, and is also credited as an influence on Cronenberg's ideas for Videodrome and served as the inspiration for the character of Brian O'Blivion. After the box office success of Scanners, Cronenberg turned down the chance of directing Return of the Jedi, having had no desire to direct material produced by other filmmakers. Cronenberg met with Pierre David in Montreal to discuss ideas for a new film, with the former pitching two ideas, one of them being Videodrome. Cronenberg admits that he was worried that the project would be rejected by Filmplan due to the excessive violent content of an early draft, but it was approved, with Claude H√©roux joking that the movie would get a triple X rating. A particular scene in an early draft involved Max Renn and Nicki Brand's faces melting and killing an onlooker.Cronenberg on Cronenberg (1992) When it came to casting the character of Max Renn, Cronenberg chose James Woods, who was a fan of Rabid and Scanners and met with the actor in Beverly Hills to offer him the part, and liked the fact that Woods was very articulate in terms of delivery. Cronenberg doubled for Woods in the scene where Max puts on the Videodrome helmet since the actor was afraid of getting electrocuted. Co-star Debbie Harry had never had such a large part before, and said that the more experienced Woods gave her a number of helpful suggestions.  Filming  Principal photography for the film began on October 19, 1981 and ended in December of that same year, with the initial week of filming being devoted to videotaping various monitor inserts. These included the television monologues of Professor Brian O'Blivion, as well as the Videodrome torture scenes and the soft-core pornographic programs Samurai Dreams and Apollo & Dionysus. The building that currently houses the Factory Theatre served as the building for Cathode Ray Mission. Three different endings were filmed. The ending used in the final film, wherein Max shoots himself on the derelict ship, was James Woods' idea. One of the initial intentions for the ending was to include an epilogue after the suicide, wherein Max, Bianca, and Nicki appear on the set of Videodrome. Bianca and Nicki are shown to have chest slits like Max, from which grotesque, mutated sex organs emerge. Cronenberg described his original vision of the ending as follows: \\"After the suicide, [Max] ends up on the 'Videodrome' set with Nicki, hugging and kissing and neat stuff like that. A happy ending? Well, it's my version of a happy ending‚Äîboy meets girl on the 'Videodrome' set, with the clay wall maybe covered in blood, but I'm not sure. Freudian rebirth imagery, pure and simple.\\" In his director's commentary for the Criterion Collection release of the film, Cronenberg credited his decision to omit the epilogue at least partially to his own atheist beliefs, as the apparent resurrection of Max and Nicki on the Videodrome set could be interpreted as having gone to an afterlife, whereas Cronenberg himself does not believe in one.  Special effects  The special makeup effects were devised by Rick Baker, with his crew composed mostly of twenty-year olds; some of them had worked with Baker in An American Werewolf in London, while Michael Lennick served as special video effects supervisor. To create the breathing effects of the television set that Max interacts with, Frank C. Carere utilized an air compressor with valves hooked to a piano keyboard that he himself operated. The undulating screen of the television set was created using a video projector and a sheet of rubbery dental dam. Baker stated that \\"I knew we would need a flexible material ... we tested with a weather balloon first, stretching it over a frame the size of a TV screen, and pushed a hand through it to see how far it stretched, and then we rear-projected on it.\\" Betamax videotape cassettes were used as items to be inserted into Max's stomach slit, because VHS cassettes were too large to fit the faux abdominal wound. Woods found the stomach slit uncomfortable, and after a long day of wearing it, vented, \\"I am not an actor anymore. I'm just the bearer of the slit!\\" Baker's original concept for Max's flesh gun featured eyes, mouth and foreskin, which Cronenberg found to be \\"too graphic\\". The cancer effects caused by Max's flesh gun went through various tests, with some tests having the face of the victim being distorted through the use of solvents, but Baker decided against this upon learning that his mentor, Dick Smith, had recently used the same technique in Spasms. Baker settled on having the cancer tumors burst out from the body of Barry Convex, with his crew operating a dummy underneath the set. Lennick devised effects such as having the image of the Videodrome television set distort whenever Max would whip it through the use of a device which he called the \\"Videodromer\\", and glitch and twitch effects related to Max's visions through the Videodrome helmet, but these effects were scrapped due to budget and time concerns.Videodrome, Criterion Collection Videodrome - Forging the New Flesh, documentary  Music  An original score was composed for Videodrome by Cronenberg's close friend, Howard Shore. The score was composed to follow Max Renn's descent into video hallucinations, starting out with dramatic orchestral music that increasingly incorporates, and eventually emphasizes, electronic instrumentation. To achieve this, Shore composed the entire score for an orchestra before programming it into a Synclavier II digital synthesizer. The rendered score, taken from the Synclavier II, was then recorded being played in tandem with a small string section. The resulting sound was a subtle blend that often made it difficult to tell which sounds were real and which were synthesized. The soundtrack was also released on vinyl by Var√®se Sarabande, and was re-released on compact disc in 1998. The album itself is not just a straight copy of Shore's score, but a remix. Shore has commented that while there were small issues with some of the acoustic numbers, \\"on the whole I think they did very well\\". Reception The film holds an 80% aggregate rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 49 reviews, with an average score of 7.39/10. Its consensus states, \\"Visually audacious, disorienting, and just plain weird, Videodrome musings on technology, entertainment, and politics still feel fresh today.\\" It has been described as a \\"disturbing techno-surrealist film\\" and \\"burningly intense, chaotic, indelibly surreal, absolutely like nothing else\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked on the film's \\"innovativeness\\", and praised Woods' performance as having a \\"sharply authentic edge\\". Adam Smith of Empire gave the film 4 out of 5 possible stars, calling it a \\"perfect example\\" of body horror. The staff of Variety wrote that the film \\"proves more fascinating than distancing\\", and commended the \\"stunning visual effects\\". Gary Arnold of The Washington Post gave the film a negative review, calling it \\"simultaneously stupefying and boring\\". C.J. Henderson reviewed Videodrome in The Space Gamer No. 63. Henderson commented that \\"Despite the fact that Videodrome came and went faster than Superman and his bullet, it is still an excellent picture. It is a genre film of high caliber, posing a number of important questions.\\" Christopher John reviewed Videodrome in Ares Magazine #14 and commented that \\"As usual, Cronenberg has pulled no punches in getting his message across. The movie is tight, and perfectly clear for anyone willing to watch the screen and think about what they are seeing.\\" Trace Thurman of Bloody Disgusting listed it as one of eight \\"horror movies that were ahead of their time\\". It was also selected as one of the \\"23 weirdest films of all time\\" by Total Film. Nick Schager of Esquire ranked the film at number 10 on their list of \\"the 50 best horror movies of the 1980s\\". Awards The film won a number of awards upon its release. At the 1984 Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film, it tied with Bloodbath at the House of Death for Best Science-Fiction Film, and Mark Irwin received a CSC Award for Best Cinematography in a Theatrical Feature. Videodrome was also nominated for eight Genie Awards, with David Cronenberg tying Bob Clark's A Christmas Story for Best Achievement in Direction. Videodrome was named the 89th-most-essential film in history by the Toronto International Film Festival. Home media Videodrome was released on VHS and DVD in the late 1990s by Universal Studios Home Entertainment, who also released the film on LaserDisc. The film was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection on August 31, 2004, and their Blu-ray edition was released on December 7, 2010. The Criterion Blu-ray features two commentary tracks, one with Cronenberg and cinematographer Mark Irwin, and the other with actors James Woods and Deborah Harry. Among the other special features are a documentary titled Forging the New Flesh; the soft-core video Samurai Dreams; the 2000 short film Camera; three trailers for Videodrome; and Fear on Film, which consists of an interview with Cronenberg, John Carpenter and John Landis, hosted by Mick Garris. In 2015, Arrow Films released the film on Blu- ray in Region B with further special features, including Cronenberg's short films Transfer (1966) and From the Drain (1967), as well as his feature films Stereo (1969) and Crimes of the Future (1970). Novelization A novelization of Videodrome was released by Zebra Books alongside the movie in 1983. Though credited to \\"Jack Martin\\", the novel was, in fact, the work of horror novelist Dennis Etchison.ISFDB - Dennis Etchision Bibliography: Videodrome Cronenberg reportedly invited Etchison up to Toronto, where they discussed and clarified the story, allowing the novel to remain as close as possible to the actions in the film. There are some differences, however, such as the inclusion of the \\"bathtub sequence\\", a scene never filmed in which a television rises from Max Renn's bathtub like a Venus in a conch shell. This was the result of the lead time required to write the book, which left Etchison working with an earlier draft of the script than was used in the film. See alsoReferencesSources * Lucas, Tim.

After a formal investigation in 1907, psychologist Oskar Pfungst demonstrated that the horse was not actually performing these mental tasks, but was watching the reactions of his trainer. He discovered this artifact in the research methodology, wherein the horse was responding directly to involuntary cues in the body language of the human trainer, who had the faculties to solve each problem. The trainer was entirely unaware that he was providing such cues. In honour of Pfungst's study, the anomalous artifact has since been referred to as the Clever Hans effect and has continued to be important knowledge in the observer-expectancy effect and later studies in animal cognition. Pfungst was an assistant to German philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf, who incorporated the experience with Hans into his further work on animal psychology and his ideas on phenomenology. Spectacle Wilhelm von Osten and Clever Hans During the early twentieth century, the public was especially interested in animal intelligence owing in a large part to Charles Darwin's recent publications. The case of Clever Hans was taken to show an advanced level of number sense in an animal. Hans was a horse owned by Wilhelm von Osten, who was a gymnasium mathematics teacher, an amateur horse trainer, phrenologist, and something of a mystic. Hans was said to have been taught to add, subtract, multiply, divide, work with fractions, tell time, keep track of the calendar, differentiate musical tones, and read, spell, and understand German. Von Osten would ask Hans, \\"If the eighth day of the month comes on a Tuesday, what is the date of the following Friday?\\" Hans would answer by tapping his hoof eleven times. Questions could be asked both orally, and in written form. Von Osten exhibited Hans throughout Germany, and never charged admission. Hans's abilities were reported in The New York Times in 1904. After von Osten died in 1909, Hans was acquired by several owners. After 1916, there is no record of him and his fate is unknown. Investigation As a result of the large amount of public interest in Clever Hans, the German board of education appointed a commission to investigate von Osten's scientific claims. Philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf formed a panel of 13 people, known as the Hans Commission. This commission consisted of a veterinarian, a circus manager, a cavalry officer, a number of schoolteachers, and the director of the Berlin zoological gardens. This commission concluded in September 1904 that no tricks were involved in Hans's performance. The commission passed off the evaluation to Oskar Pfungst, who tested the basis for these claimed abilities by: # Isolating horse and questioner from spectators, so no cues could come from them # Using questioners other than the horse's master # By means of blinders, varying whether the horse could see the questioner # Varying whether the questioner knew the answer to the question in advance. Using a substantial number of trials, Pfungst found that the horse could get the correct answer even if von Osten himself did not ask the questions, ruling out the possibility of fraud. However, the horse gave the right answer only when the questioner knew what the answer was and the horse could see the questioner. He observed that when von Osten knew the answers to the questions, Hans got 89 percent of the answers correct, but when von Osten did not know the answers to the questions, Hans answered only six percent of the questions correctly. Pfungst then proceeded to examine the behaviour of the questioner in detail, and showed that as the horse's taps approached the right answer, the questioner's posture and facial expression changed in ways that were consistent with an increase in tension, which was released when the horse made the final, correct tap. This provided a cue that the horse could use to tell it to stop tapping. The social communication systems of horses may depend on the detection of small postural changes, and this would explain why Hans so easily picked up on the cues given by von Osten, even if these cues were subconscious. Pfungst carried out laboratory tests with human subjects, in which he played the part of the horse. Pfungst asked subjects to stand on his right and think \\"with a high degree of concentration\\" about a particular number, or a simple mathematical problem. Pfungst would then tap out the answer with his right hand. He frequently observed \\"a sudden slight upward jerk of the head\\" when reaching the final tap, and noted that this corresponded to the subject resuming the position they had adopted before thinking of the question. Even after this official debunking, von Osten, who was never persuaded by Pfungst's findings, continued to show Hans around Germany, attracting large and enthusiastic crowds. The Clever Hans effect After Pfungst had become adept at giving Hans performances himself, and was fully aware of the subtle cues which made them possible, he discovered that he would produce these cues involuntarily regardless of whether he wished to exhibit or suppress them. Recognition of this phenomenon has had a large effect on experimental design and methodology for all experiments whatsoever involving sentient subjects, including humans. The risk of Clever Hans effects is one reason why comparative psychologists normally test animals in isolated apparatus, without interaction with them. However this creates problems of its own, because many of the most interesting phenomena in animal cognition are only likely to be demonstrated in a social context, and in order to train and demonstrate them, it is necessary to build up a social relationship between trainer and animal. This point of view has been strongly argued by Irene Pepperberg in relation to her studies of parrots (Alex), and by Allen and Beatrix Gardner in their study of the chimpanzee Washoe. If the results of such studies are to gain universal acceptance, it is necessary to find some way of testing the animals' achievements which eliminates the risk of Clever Hans effects. However, simply removing the trainer from the scene may not be an appropriate strategy, because where the social relationship between trainer and subject is strong, the removal of the trainer may produce emotional responses preventing the subject from performing. It is therefore necessary to devise procedures where none of those present knows what the animal's likely response may be. The Clever Hans Effect has also been observed in drug- sniffing dogs. A study at University of California, Davis revealed that cues can be telegraphed by the handler to the dogs, resulting in false positives. A 2004 study of Rico, a border collie reported by his owners as having a vocabulary of over 200 words, avoided the Clever Hans effect by having the owner ask the dog to fetch items from an adjacent room, so that the owner could not provide real time feedback while the dog was selecting an object. As Pfungst's final experiment makes clear, Clever Hans effects are quite as likely to occur in experiments with humans as in experiments with animals. For this reason, care is often taken in fields such as perception, cognitive psychology, and social psychology to make experiments double-blind, meaning that neither the experimenter nor the subject knows what condition the subject is in, and thus what his or her responses are predicted to be. Another way in which Clever Hans effects are avoided is by replacing the experimenter with a computer, which can deliver standardized instructions and record responses without giving clues.

He started writing under the name George Awoonor-Williams,Hans M. Zell, Carol Bundy & Virginia Coulon (eds), A New Reader's Guide to African Literature, Heinemann Educational Books, 1983, p. 355. and was also published as Kofi Nyidevu Awoonor. He taught African literature at the University of Ghana. Professor Awoonor was among those who were killed in the September 2013 attack at Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, where he was a participant at the Storymoja Hay Festival. Biography George Kofi Nyidevu Awoonor-Williams was born in Wheta,\\"Kofi Awoonor: Remembering a Ghanaian poet\\", BBC News - Africa, 23 September 2013. in the Volta region of what was then the Gold Coast, present-day Ghana. He was the eldest of 10 children in the family.Jocelyn Edwards, \\"Ghana Mourns Kofi Awoonor Death\\", Huff Post Books, 25 September 2013. He was a paternal descendant of the Awoonor-Williams family of Sierra Leone Creole descent. He was educated at Achimota School and then proceeded to the University of Ghana, graduating in 1960. While at university he wrote his first poetry book, Rediscovery, published in 1964. Like the rest of his work, Rediscovery is rooted in African oral poetry. His early works were inspired by the singing and verse of his native Ewe people, and he later published translations of the work of three Ewe dirge singers (Guardians of the Sacred Word: Ewe Poetry, 1973).Nii Ayikwei Parkes, \\"A Tribute to Kofi Awoonor: The Story of Sankofa\\" , Africa is a Country, 1 October 2013. Awoonor managed the Ghana Film Corporation and helped to found the Ghana Playhouse, going on to have a significant role in developing theatre and drama in the country. He was also an editor of the literary journal Okyeame and an associate editor of Transition Magazine. He studied literature at University College London (M.A., 1970), and while in England wrote several radio plays for the BBC, and began using the name Kofi Awoonor.Siga Fatima Jagne, Pushpa Naidu Parekh (eds), \\"Kofi Awoonor (1935‚Äì)\\", in Postcolonial African Writers: A Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook, Routledge, 1998, p. 53. He spent the early 1970s in the United States, studying and teaching at Stony Brook University (then called SUNY at Stony Brook) where he obtained his Phd in 1972.Deon J. Hampton, \\"Kofi Awoonor killed in Kenya mall attack, was Stony Brook professor\\", Long Island Newsday, 22 September 2013. While in the United States he wrote This Earth, My Brother and Night of My Blood, both books published in 1971. Awoonor returned to Ghana in 1975 as head of the English department at the University of Cape Coast. Within months he was arrested for helping a soldier accused of trying to overthrow the military government and was imprisoned without trial; Awoonor was later released when his sentence was remitted in October 1976. The House by the Sea is about his time in jail. After imprisonment he became politically active. He continued to write mostly non-fiction. Awoonor was Ghana's ambassador to Brazil from 1984 to 1988, before serving as his country's ambassador to Cuba. From 1990 to 1994 Awoonor was Ghana's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, where he headed the committee against apartheid. He was also a former Chairman of the Council of State, the main advisory body to the president of Ghana, serving in that position from 2009 to January 2013.  Death  On 21 September 2013, Awoonor was among those killed in an attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi. He was in Kenya as a participant in the Storymoja Hay Festival, a four-day celebration of writing, thinking and storytelling, at which he was due to perform on the evening of his death. His nephew Nii Parkes, who was attending the same literary festival, has written about meeting him for the first time that day.Nii Parkes, \\"My hero: Kofi Awoonor by Nii Parkes\\", The Guardian, 28 September 2013. The Ghanaian government confirmed Awoonor's death the next day. His son Afetsi Awoonor who accompanied him was also shot, but was later discharged from hospital. Awoonor's remains were flown from Nairobi to Accra, Ghana, on 25 September 2013.Kofi Anyidoho, \\"African Postman: Death of a Poet\\", Petchary's Blog. His body was cremated and buried at a particular spot in his hometown at Wheta in the Volta Region. Also there was no crying or mourning at his funeral all according to his will before death.

But he is a peculiar and unique writer, one who strives, almost too hard, to bring his ancestry and culture into his poems, sometimes even borrowing words from the local Ewe dialect. Being such a strong and avid practitioner of the traditional religion meant that he was of a relict species. Especially for one so highly educated, it was an even rarer phenomenon. That awareness, not only that he was a relict specimen as an individual, but that the entire culture was suffering entropy, may have come through his poems in a manner that would suggest at first that he was writing about his mortal end. Besides the personal and cultural lament, Awoonor also shrewdly decried what he would have considered the decadent spectre of Western influences (religions, social organisation and economic philosophy) on the history and fortunes of African people in general. He would lambast the thoughtless exuberance with which Africans themselves embraced such things, and gradually engineered what he would have considered a self-degradation that went far beyond a loss of cultural identity. He would often construct his writings to look at these things through the lens of his own Ewe culture.

Since its dedication on November 3, 1990, there has been much speculation about the meaning of the four encrypted messages it bears. Of these four messages, the first three have been solved, while the fourth message remains one of the most famous unsolved codes in the world. The sculpture continues to be of interest to cryptanalysts, both amateur and professional, who are attempting to decipher the fourth passage. The artist has so far given four clues to this passage.  Description  The main part of the sculpture is located in the northwest corner of the New Headquarters Building courtyard, outside of the Agency's cafeteria. The sculpture comprises four large copper plates with other elements consisting of water, wood, plants, red and green granite, white quartz, and petrified wood. The most prominent feature is a large vertical S-shaped copper screen resembling a scroll or a piece of paper emerging from a computer printer, half of which consists of encrypted text. The characters are all found within the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, along with question marks, and are cut out of the copper plates. The main sculpture contains four separate enigmatic messages, three of which have been deciphered. In addition to the main part of the sculpture, Jim Sanborn also placed other pieces of art at the CIA grounds, such as several large granite slabs with sandwiched copper sheets outside the entrance to the New Headquarters Building. Several morse code messages are found on these copper sheets, and one of the stone slabs has an engraving of a compass rose pointing to a lodestone. Other elements of Sanborn's installation include a landscaped garden area, a fish pond with opposing wooden benches, a reflecting pool, and other pieces of stone including a triangle shaped black stone slab. The name Kryptos comes from the ancient Greek word for \\"hidden\\", and the theme of the sculpture is \\"Intelligence Gathering\\". The cost of the sculpture in 1988 was US $250,000 (worth US $501,000 in 2016).  Encrypted messages  The ciphertext on the left-hand side of the sculpture (as seen from the courtyard) of the main sculpture contains 869 characters in total: 865 letters and 4 question marks. In April 2006, however, Sanborn released information stating that a letter was omitted from this side of Kryptos \\"for aesthetic reasons, to keep the sculpture visually balanced\\".Zetter, Kim. \\"Typo Confounds Kryptos Sleuths\\" Wired April 20, 2006 There are also three misspelled words in the plaintext of the deciphered first three passages, which Sanborn has said was intentional, and three letters (YAR) near the beginning of the bottom half of the left side are the only characters on the sculpture in superscript. The right-hand side of the sculpture comprises a keyed Vigen√®re encryption tableau, consisting of 867 letters. One of the lines of the Vigen√®re tableau has an extra character (L). Bauer, Link and MolleBauer, Link and Molle, 2016, p. 548. suggest that this may be a reference to the Hill cipher as an encryption method for the fourth passage of the sculpture. { -----  EMUFPHZLRFAXYUSDJKZLDKRNSHGNFIVJ YQTQUXQBQVYUVLLTREVJYQTMKYRDMFD VFPJUDEEHZWETZYVGWHKKQETGFQJNCE GGWHKK?DQMCPFQZDQMMIAGPFXHQRLG TIMVMZJANQLVKQEDAGDVFRPJUNGEUNA QZGZLECGYUXUEENJTBJLBQCRTBJDFHRR YIZETKZEMVDUFKSJHKFWHKUWQLSZFTI HHDDDUVH?DWKBFUFPWNTDFIYCUQZERE EVLDKFEZMOQQJLTTUGSYQPFEUNLAVIDX FLGGTEZ?FKZBSFDQVGOGIPUFXHHDRKF FHQNTGPUAECNUVPDJMQCLQUMUNEDFQ ELZZVRRGKFFVOEEXBDMVPNFQXEZLGRE DNQFMPNZGLFLPMRJQYALMGNUVPDXVKP DQUMEBEDMHDAFMJGZNUPLGEWJLLAETG  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCD AKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYP BRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPT CYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTO DPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOS ETOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSA FOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSAB GSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABC HABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCD IBCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDE JCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEF KDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFG LEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGH MFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHI -----  ENDYAHROHNLSRHEOCPTEOIBIDYSHNAIA CHTNREYULDSLLSLLNOHSNOSMRWXMNE TPRNGATIHNRARPESLNNELEBLPIIACAE WMTWNDITEENRAHCTENEUDRETNHAEOE TFOLSEDTIWENHAEIOYTEYQHEENCTAYCR EIFTBRSPAMHHEWENATAMATEGYEERLB TEEFOASFIOTUETUAEOTOARMAEERTNRTI BSEDDNIAAHTTMSTEWPIEROAGRIEWFEB AECTDDHILCEIHSITEGOEAOSDDRYDLORIT RKLMLEHAGTDHARDPNEOHMGFMFEUHE ECDMRIPFEIMEHNLSSTTRTVDOHW?OBKR UOXOGHULBSOLIFBBWFLRVQQPRNGKSSO TWTQSJQSSEKZZWATJKLUDIAWINFBNYP VTTMZFPKWGDKZXTJCDIGKUHUAUEKCAR  NGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJL OHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJL PIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLM QJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMN RLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQ SMNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQU TNQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUV UQUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVW VUVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWX WVWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZ XWXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZK YXZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKR ZZKRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRY ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCD } Sanborn worked with a retiring CIA employee named Ed Scheidt, Chairman of the CIA Office of Communications, to come up with the cryptographic systems used on the sculpture. Sanborn has revealed that the sculpture contains a riddle within a riddle, which will be solvable only after the four encrypted passages have been deciphered. He has given conflicting information about the sculpture's answer, saying at one time that he gave the complete solution to the then-CIA director William Webster during the dedication ceremony; but later, he also said that he had not given Webster the entire solution. He did, however, confirm that a passage of the plaintext of the second message reads \\"Who knows the exact location? Only WW.\\" Sanborn also confirmed that should he die before the entire sculpture becomes deciphered, there will be someone able to confirm the solution.Zetter, Kim. \\"Questions for Kryptos' Creator,\\" Wired (January 20, 2005). In 2020, Sanborn stated that he planned to put the secret to the solution up for auction when he dies.  Solvers  The first person to announce publicly that he had solved the first three passages was Jim Gillogly, a computer scientist from southern California, who deciphered these passages using a computer, and revealed his solutions in 1999. After Gillogly's announcement, the CIA revealed that their analyst David Stein had solved the same passages in 1998 using pencil and paper techniques, although at the time of his solution the information was only disseminated within the intelligence community. No public announcement was made until July 1999, although in November 1998 it was revealed that \\"a CIA analyst working on his own time [had] solved \\"the lion's share\\" of it\\". The NSA also claimed that some of their employees had solved the same three passages, but would not reveal names or dates until March 2000, when it was learned that an NSA team led by Ken Miller, along with Dennis McDaniels and two other unnamed individuals, had solved passages 1‚Äì3 in late 1992. In 2013, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Elonka Dunin, the NSA released documents which show the NSA became involved in attempts to solve the Kryptos puzzle in 1992, following a challenge by Bill Studeman, then Deputy Director of the CIA. The documents show that by June 1993, a small group of NSA cryptanalysts had succeeded in solving the first three passages of the sculpture. The above attempts to solve Kryptos found that passage 2 ended with WESTIDBYROWS, but in 2005, Monet Friedrich, a logician, philosopher, and computer scientist from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, determined that another possible plaintext was: WESTXLAYERTWO. In 2006, Sanborn announced that he had made an error in passage 2, and confirmed that the last passage of the plaintext was WESTXLAYERTWO, and not WESTIDBYROWS. Sanborn had inadvertently omitted a letter S in the crypt text. By rotating the keyword to BSCISSAA it decrypts to WESTPLAYERTWO. The significance of this is that WESTXLAYERTWO is the original plain text. It was intentional that WESTIDBYROWS was discovered at a later stage by following a clue to manipulate the letter (or numeral) X.  Solutions  The following are the solutions of passages 1‚Äì3 of the sculpture. Misspellings present in the text are included verbatim.  Solution of passage 1  Method : Vigen√®re Keywords: Kryptos, Palimpsest BETWEEN SUBTLE SHADING AND THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT LIES THE NUANCE OF IQLUSION Iqlusion was an intentional misspelling of illusion.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/29/climate/kryptos- sculpture-final-clue.html  Solution of passage 2  Method : Vigen√®re Keywords: Kryptos, Abscissa IT WAS TOTALLY INVISIBLE HOWS THAT POSSIBLE ?

ONLY WW THIS WAS HIS LAST MESSAGE X THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES SIX POINT FIVE SECONDS NORTH SEVENTY SEVEN DEGREES EIGHT MINUTES FORTY FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYER TWO On April 19, 2006, Sanborn contacted an online community dedicated to the Kryptos puzzle to inform them that the accepted solution to passage 2 was incorrect. He said that he made an error in the sculpture by omitting an \\"X\\" used to separate sentences, for aesthetic reasons, and that the deciphered text that ended \\"...FOUR SECONDS WEST ID BY ROWS\\" should actually be \\"...FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYER TWO\\".

This is a paraphrased quotation from Howard Carter's account of the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun on November 26, 1922, as described in his 1923 book The Tomb of Tutankhamun. The question with which it ends is asked by Lord Carnarvon, to which Carter (in the book) famously replied \\"wonderful things\\". In the November 26, 1922, field notes, however, his reply was, \\"Yes, it is wonderful\\".  Clues given for passage 4  When commenting in 2006 about his error in passage 2, Sanborn said that the answers to the first three passages contain clues to the fourth passage. In November 2010, Sanborn released a clue, publicly stating that \\"NYPVTT\\", the 64th‚Äì‚Å†69th letters in passage four, become \\"BERLIN\\" after decryption. Sanborn gave The New York Times another clue in November 2014: the letters \\"MZFPK\\", the 70th‚Äì‚Å†74th letters in passage four, become \\"CLOCK\\" after decryption. The 74th letter is K in both the plaintext and ciphertext, meaning that it is possible for a character to encrypt to itself. This means it does not have a weakness, where a character could never be encrypted as itself, that was known to be inherent in the German Enigma machine. Sanborn further stated that in order to solve passage 4, \\"You'd better delve into that particular clock,\\" but added, \\"There are several really interesting clocks in Berlin.\\" The particular clock in question is presumably the Berlin Clock, although the Alexanderplatz World Clock and Clock of Flowing Time are other candidates. In an article published on January 29, 2020, by the New York Times, Sanborn gave another clue: at positions 26-34, ciphertext \\"QQPRNGKSS\\" is the word \\"NORTHEAST\\". In August 2020, Sanborn revealed that the four letters in positions 22-25, ciphertext \\"FLRV\\", in the plaintext are \\"EAST\\". Sanborn commented that he \\"released this layout to several people as early as April\\". The first person known to have shared this hint more widely was Sukhwant Singh.  Related sculptures  Kryptos was the first cryptographic sculpture made by Sanborn. After producing Kryptos he went on to make several other sculptures with codes and other types of writing, including one entitled Antipodes, which is at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., an \\"Untitled Kryptos Piece\\" that was sold to a private collector, and Cyrillic Projector, which contains encrypted Russian Cyrillic text that included an extract from a classified KGB document. The cipher on one side of Antipodes repeats the text from Kryptos. Much of the cipher on Antipodes other side is duplicated on Cyrillic Projector. The Russian portion of the cipher found on Cyrillic Projector and Antipodes was solved in 2003 by Frank Corr and Mike Bales independently from each other with translation from Russian plaintext provided by Elonka Dunin.Cyrillic Riddle Solved Science, vol 302, 10 Oct. 2003, page 224 Ex Nexum was installed in 1997 at Little Rock Old U.S. Post Office & Courthouse. Some additional sculptures by Sanborn include Native American texts: Rippowam was installed at the University of Connecticut, in Stamford in 1999, while Lux was installed in 2001 at an old US Post Office building in Fort Myers, Florida. Indian Run is located next to the U.S. Federal Courthouse in Beltsville, Maryland, and contains a bronze cylinder perforated with the text of the Iroquois Book of the Great Law. This document includes the contribution of the indigenous peoples to the United States legal system. The text is written in Onondaga and was transcribed from the ancient oral tradition of five Iroquois nations. A,A was installed at the Plaza in front of the new library at the University of Houston, in Houston, Texas, in 2004, and Radiance was installed at the Department of Energy, Coast, and Environment, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge in 2008.  In popular culture  The dust jacket of the US version of Dan Brown's 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code contains two references to Kryptos - one on the back cover (coordinates printed light red on dark red, vertically next to the blurbs) is a reference to the coordinates mentioned in the plaintext of passage 2 (see above), except the degrees digit is off by one. When Brown and his publisher were asked about this, they both gave the same reply: \\"The discrepancy is intentional\\". The coordinates were part of the first clue of the second Da Vinci Code WebQuest, the first answer being Kryptos. The other reference is hidden in the brown \\"tear\\" artwork‚Äîupside-down words which say \\"Only WW knows\\", which is another reference to the second message on Kryptos. Kryptos features in Dan Brown's 2009 novel The Lost Symbol.Secrets of the Lost Symbol, pp.319‚Äì326 A small version of Kryptos appears in the season 5 episode of Alias \\"S.O.S.\\". In it, Marshall Flinkman, in a small moment of comic relief, says he has cracked the code just by looking at it during a tour visit to the CIA office. The solution he describes sounds like the solution to the first two parts. In the season 2 episode of The King of Queens \\"Meet By-Product\\", a framed picture of Kryptos hangs on the wall by the door. The progressive metal band Between the Buried and Me has a reference to Kryptos in their song \\"Obfuscation\\" from their 2009 album, The Great Misdirect.

In 2011, Microsemi acquired Zarlink in a hostile takeover and merged it into its own operations. In its last years as an independent entity, the company's core capabilities were in network timing, voice enhancement and ultra low-power wireless communication. Its head offices were located in Ottawa, Canada. Zarlink sold products to 3,000 customers in more than 100 countries. In 2011, it had approximately 500 employees worldwide, including in development centres in Canada and the U.S., and specialized fabrication facilities in Wales. Essentially all of its manufacturing was done off-shore through subcontracting partners. History=Early history Zarlink was part of Mitel Corporation which was founded by Terry Matthews and Michael Cowpland in 1973. In 1982 the company developed the industry's first T1/E1 framer chip introduced the industry's first echo cancellation chip in 1996. In 1998, Mitel acquired GEC-Plessey Semiconductor in the UK from the General Electric Company plc for US $225 million in cash, through which it gained wireless technology and communications ASIC and systems integration expertise, including RF (Radio Frequency) technology. The combined semiconductor businesses at the time ranked Mitel among the top ten networking companies in the world. 21st century Zarlink MT352CG - a COFDM Demodulator By 2000, the semiconductor and PBX divisions had combined annual revenues of USD $1.4 billion. However the semiconductor business was experiencing significant growth while the PBX division grew more slowly in the face of competition from Cisco, Avaya and other significant players. PBX division With Kirk Mandy as CEO and President, Mitel in 2001 sold its PBX division back to Terry Matthews along with the Mitel name for CDN $300 million. The PBX division had growth of 5-6% annually while the semiconductor division had been growing at 45-47%. Soon after, Mandy retired and was replaced by a management team drawn mainly from National Semiconductor. Division renamed The semiconductor division was renamed Zarlink to reflect its interest in networking. It derives either from the Latin word \\"Caesar\\" or Russian word \\"Tsar\\" meaning \\"one having great power or authority\\" and the word \\"link\\" which means \\"to connect or be connected\\". With the sale Zarlink became a pure play semiconductor company focused on specialized markets. Over time it became virtually fabless by selling essentially all of its fabrication plants and other manufacturing facilities to third parties and outsourcing the bulk of its production. Foundry In 2002 Zarlink sold its foundry in Bromont, Quebec, Canada to Dalsa Corporation, and its wafer fabrication facility in Plymouth, UK to X-FAB Semiconductor Foundries AG. In the same year, the company unveiled the industry's first high-density CESoP (Circuit Emulation Services-over-Packet) packet processor to allow service providers to carry TDM traffic over IP networks. In 2003 it significantly expanded its timing portfolio to offer a comprehensive range of digital, analog and module synchronization products. With worsening economic conditions globally Zarlink implemented several workforce reductions while trying to widely diversify the company's product portfolio. This strategy proved to be unsuccessful. Mandy returned to head up the company in 2003. In the following years there were several additional workforce reductions and non-core assets were sold off. RF Front-End In 2005 it announced the sale of its RF Front-End consumer business to Intel and in 2006 the sale of its Packet Switching product group to Conexant Systems. In 2004 Given Imaging selected Zarlink's ultra low-power RF transmitter chip for use in the world's first swallowable camera capsule. Zarlink's RF chip transmits two movie- quality images per second from the capsule, allowing a more thorough and non- invasive examination of the gastrointestinal tract. In 2009 the company announced that it had shipped over one million RF chips for use in Given Imaging's PillCam SB video capsules. Transceiver chip In 2005 Zarlink launched the industry's first ultra low-power transceiver chip for wireless communication systems designed exclusively to operate in the Medical Implantable Communication Service (MICS) band, used to link implanted medical devices and base stations. In 2008 the chip won an EE Times Product of the Year award. In the same year the company announced that it had already shipped over 30,000 modules incorporating the chip to St. Jude Medical for use in implanted defibrillators. The chip and module is being designed into a variety of medical implantable devices and external instruments such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and devices used to treat dystonia, acute pain, parkinsons, epilepsy, and other advanced monitoring, diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In June 2007 Zarlink acquired Legerity, a privately held former division of AMD, headquartered in Austin, Texas for US$134.5 million in cash. Legerity was a leading supplier of analog voice technologies for carrier, enterprise and residential gateway equipment. Analog foundry In February 2008, it sold an unprofitable analog foundry in the United Kingdom and successfully defended itself against a dissident shareholder battle led by a 5 percent stakeholder accusing Zarlink of overspending on R&D.; Implant project Zarlink announced a Zarlink-led Self-Energizing Implantable Medical Microsystem (SIMM) project which successfully designed and tested an in-body microgenerator that will harvest energy from the heartbeat to power implanted medical devices. In 2009 the project was named winner of the Emerging Technology Award at the Institution of Engineering and Technology's (IET) Innovation Awards in London, England. Late history In May 2010 it sold its Optical Products Group in Sweden and Phoenix and set its focus on its timing, synchronization, medical and line circuit businesses. In September 2010 it sold a campus located in J√§rf√§lla, Sweden for US$16M to a company affiliated with the Stendorren group in Stockholm. Following the Legerity acquisition Zarlink significantly reduced its manufacturing costs, made changes to its management team (including the appointment of Garry Tanner to CEO, formerly COO at Legerity), launched three new technology platforms (one for each of its businesses) and aggressively drove the company's finances forward. Fiscal 2011 operating income reached $39 million up from $19 million the previous year and net income reached $69 million, up from $7 million in 2011. In 2011 revenues from its timing and synchronization business grew by 38% while its voice telephony business grew by 34%. The company's share price rose tenfold compared to March 2009, and it roughly doubled its cash and cash equivalents to $124 million at the end of the first quarter, from $62 million a year earlier. Its revenues reached $220 million in fiscal 2011 and profits grew eightfold. Takeover Zarlink's turnaround attracted several supposedly \\"unsolicited\\" offers by Microsemi, an $800 million company. After being rebuffed Microsemi was forced to improve its valuation of the company. In reaction to the increased offers Zarlink's Board launched a strategic alternatives review process. In October, 2011 Microsemi agreed to acquire Zarlink for $3.98 a share, a nearly 70% premium over its trading price, for a total consideration of over USD $630 million.

It is considered the locality in the center of the country. The town administers two villages, Cove»ô (K√§bisch; √Ågotak√∂vesd) and Ruja (Roseln; Rozsonda). Demographics The population was 8,300 at the 2011 census, of which 94.2% were Romanians, 2.9% Hungarians, 1.5% Roma and 1% Germans. History The first document mentioning it is a land sale contract signed in 1280 by one Henric from Sancta Agatha. In 1376, Louis I of Hungary granted to the village the right to hold a market. In 1466, Matthias Corvinus granted to the village the right to carry trials (jus gladi) and built a fortress to defend the Kingdom of Hungary from the Ottoman Empire. Agnita, mentioned for the first time in a document from 1280, is a town with traditional crafts, famous for the old guilds of tanners, shoemakers, tailors, coopers and potters, with semi-rural economy. Here is one of the oldest peasant fortification in Transylvania. Initiated in the thirteenth century, it was amplified successively came to be in the seventeenth century, three fortified enclosure with towers. The city center is a church-hall with three ships (naves with stands) and turn west (XV around the year 1409). In turn strengthened the church has undergone many transformations. The four towers of the fortified church - the shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths and coopers - demonstrates the economic strength of these guilds, and were assigned to the defense that those portions of the wall in case of armed conflict. City Museum has a substantial collection of medieval art (Gothic chests, architecture, sculpture, ceramics, etc.). King of Hungary, Louis of Anjou, conferred Agnita (our villa Zenthagata) since 1376, the right to hold annual fair on 24 June (day of St. John). Subsequently, this right is extended the other two fairs. In 1466, Hungarian king granted the town Agnita right \\"ius Gladiator\\", i.e. the right to decide and execute the death sentence. In the same year, the village is allowed to keep half of the contingent settlement of royal troops to defend their own city to the church from falling into foreign hands, since it was near the frontier into Wallachia. Until 1950, when the city was declared, was a common Agnita fair (Marktgemeinde). The railway was built in 1898 from Sighi»ôoara to the terminus at Agnita railway station and further extended to Sibiu in 1910 with a station at Cove»ô. However, by 1965 the route was curtailed at Agnita with the closure of the line north including the section through the town. As a result, a new station was built in the west however in 2001 this too was closed. The line is a historic monument and there is an active movement to restore the entire line.

It was powered by four Junkers Jumo 004 engines, featured an unusual and novel forward-swept wing, and apart from the wing was assembled largely from components scavenged from other aircraft. It was one of the very few jet propelled aircraft ever built with fixed landing gear. Development Model of Ju 287 V1 from side bottom view The Ju 287 was intended to provide the Luftwaffe with a bomber that could avoid interception by outrunning enemy fighters. The swept-forward wing was suggested by the project's head designer Dr. Hans Wocke as a way of providing extra lift at low airspeeds - necessary because of the poor responsiveness of early turbojets at the vulnerable times of takeoff and landing. A further structural advantage of the forward-swept wing was that it would allow for a single massive weapons bay in the best location, the centre of gravity of the plane, with the main wing spar passing behind the bomb bay. The same structural requirement meant the wing could then be located at the best aerodynamic location, the centre of the fuselage. Prior to the assembly of the first Ju 287, an He 177 A-5 (designated as na He 177 prototype, V38) was modified at the Letov plant in Prague to examine the technical characteristics of this single large bomb bay design. Side view (Model) The first and second prototypes (Ju 287 V1 and V2; both designated Ju 288 V201 and Ju 288 V202 for security reasons) were intended to evaluate the concept, with V1 being intended to test the FSW and V2 being earmarked for evaluating flight at high subsonic speeds, and both were assembled from the fuselages of the He 177 A-5, the tail of the Ju 188G-2, main undercarriage from a Ju 352, and nosewheels taken from shot-down B-24 Liberators, all of which were fixed to lower weight and complexity, and equipped with spats to reduce drag. The fixed undercarriage was used as the wing box couldn't have cutouts for wheel stowage which would reduce wing torsion box stiffness required for the forward sweep design. Later prototypes with higher power engines and higher top speed would have the undercarriage stowage in the centre fuselage sides Two of the Jumo 004 engines were hung in nacelles (pods) under the wings, with the other two mounted in nacelles added to the sides of the forward fuselage. Flight tests began on 16 August 1944 (pilot: Siegfried HolzbaurWochenbericht der Erprobungsstelle Rechlin der Woche vom 6. bis zum 12. August 1944), with the aircraft displaying extremely good handling characteristics, as well as revealing some of the problems of the forward-swept wing under some flight conditions. The most notable of these drawbacks was 'wing warping', or excessive in flight flexing of the main spar and wing assembly. Tests suggested that the warping problem would be eliminated by concentrating greater engine mass under the wings. This technical improvement would be incorporated in the subsequent prototypes with under wing engines moved forward under leading edge as a mass balance. The Ju 287 was intended to be powered by four Heinkel-Hirth HeS 011 engines, but because of the development problems experienced with that engine, the BMW 003 was selected in its place. The second prototype (Junkers Ju 287 V2) would have had six engines (originally four underwing BMW 003s and two fuselage-mounted Jumo 004s, but later changed to two triple clusters composed of four Jumo 004s and two BMW 003s), and also differed from the Ju 287 V1 in having the main undercarriage struts with an inward cant, the horizontal stabilizer lowered by 30 centimeters, and light grey-colored trouser pants for the nose wheels. The third prototype, the Junkers Ju 287 V3, employed six BMW 003s, in a triple cluster under each wing, and featured the all-new fuselage and tail design intended for the production bomber, the Ju 287A-1, utilizing a pressurised cockpit used on the Junkers Ju 288. The Ju 287 V4 and V5 would have served as prototypes of the Ju 287A-2 and Ju 287B-1 respectively, and the V5 and V6 were to feature tail armament and ejection seats. The Ju 287B-1 would have had four thrust HeS 011 turbojets, while the Junkers Ju 287B-2 was to employ two thrust BMW 018 turbojets. While the Heinkel turbojet was in the pre-production phase at war's end, work on BMW's radical and very powerful turbine engine never proceeded past three barely-tested prototypes. The final Ju 287 variant design to be mooted was a Mistel combination-plane ground attack version, comprising an unmanned explosives-packed \\"drone\\" 287 and a manned Me 262 fighter attached to the top of the bomber by a strut assembly. The cockpit of the 287 would be replaced by a massive impact-fused warhead. Takeoff and flight control of the combination would be under the direction of the 262's pilot. The 262 would disengage from the 287 drone as the Mistel neared its target, the pilot of the fighter remotely steering the 287 for the terminal phase of its strike mission.Lommel, Horst, 2004. Junkers Ju 287: The World's First Swept-Wing Jet Aircraft. Atglen, PA: Shiffer Publishing, Ltd.Ju 287 Mistel Work on the Ju 287 programme, along with all other pending German bomber projects (including Junkers' other ongoing heavy bomber design, the piston-engined Ju 488) came to a halt in July 1944,Ford 2013, p. 224. but Junkers was allowed to go forward with the flight testing regime on the V1 prototype. The components for the Junkers Ju 287 V2 had been completed by that time, and were shipped to Brandis for final assembly. Seventeen test flights were undertaken in total, which passed without notable incident. Minor problems, however, did arise with the turbojet engines and the equally-experimental HWK 109-501 higher-thrust (14.71 kN apiece) bipropellant Starthilfe RATO booster units,Krakow Polish Aviation Museum's page on the HWK 109-501 Starthilfe RATO pod which proved to be unreliable over sustained periods. This initial test phase was designed purely to assess the low-speed handling qualities of the forward-swept wing, but despite this the V1 was dived at full jet power on at least one occasion, attaining a speed in the medium dive-angle employed of 660 km/h. To gain data on airflow patterns, small woolen tufts were glued to the airframe and the \\"behavior\\" of these tufts during flight was captured by a cine camera mounted on a sturdy tripod directly ahead of the plane's tailfin. After the seventeenth and last flight in late autumn of 1944, the V1 was transferred to the Luftwaffe's primary Erprobungsstelle evaluation and test centre at Rechlin, for flow tests. However, in March 1945, for unknown reasons, the Ju 287 program was restarted, with the RLM issuing a requirement for mass production of the jet bomber (100 airframes a month) as soon as possible. Postwar development The Junkers factory in Dessau was overrun by the Red Army in late April 1945. Before long, the Junkers Ju 287 V2 had been almost completed, waiting for its engines to be fitted, and construction of the V3 had reached 80-90 percent completion, while the V4 was reportedly 60 percent complete. Both V1 and V2 were destroyed by the Nazis to avoid capture by Allied forces. Wocke and his staff were captured by the Red Army and taken to the Soviet Union, and remnants of V2, especially the wings, were used in construction of the EF 131 which was flown on 23 May 1947, but by that time, jet development had already overtaken the Ju 287. A final much-enlarged derivative, the EF 140, was tested in prototype form in 1949 but soon abandoned.Griehl, Manfred, 2004. Jet Planes of the Third Reich, Secret Projects: Volume 2.

It can be achieved only by Black, who can deliver checkmate on move 2 with the queen. Fool's Mate received its name because it can only occur if White commits an extraordinary blunder. Even among rank beginners, this type of checkmate almost never occurs in practice.

History Uricani is first mentioned in a certified document dated 1888, when the locality was referred to as Hobicza-Urik√°ny (in Romanian both Hobiceni-Uricani and Uricani-Hobiceni versions were used). The name of Uricani is derived from the union of two villages, Hobi»õa (Hobica, listed in documents from 1473 first as Ohabycza) and Uric (Urik, from 1473 first as Wryk) from Ha»õeg Land. After 1920 the locality's name was changed to Uricani. Over time, the village of C√¢mpu lui Neag functioned as either a separate commune or as a village belonging to Uricani. In 1965, Uricani was declared a city. It administers two villages, C√¢mpu lui Neag (Kimpuluny√°g) and Valea de Brazi. Like the other Jiu Valley cities, Uricani's principal economic activities revolve around the region's coal mines, although the city, like the region, is in a period of transition as the mines have been gradually closed and many of the workers made redundant. Location The city location lies on the western side of Jiu Valley and at the foot of the Retezat Mountains, with the geographical coordinates of 23o10‚Äô meridian, east longitude and 45o25‚Äô parallel, north latitude. The city is located in Hunedoara County and adjacent to Mehedinti and Gorj counties. It lies at an altitude of 729 m altitude on the west side of the Petrosani Depression and along the West Jiu River. Its area also contains the smaller waterways of Lazarul, Valea de Pesti, Buta, and Bilugu, as well as the fresh water reservoir which contains the drinking water used throughout Jiu Valley. Uricani is accessed via the DN 66A, the 27 kilometer long west branch of the DN 66 that connects the cities of Petrosani, Vulcan, Lupeni and Uricani. The city covers 25,141 hectares, the largest geographical area of all the Jiu Valley cities. The city limits are bordered to the east by Cow‚Äôs Valley, to the west by Retezat National Park, to the north by peaks of the Retezat Mountains (Custura, Lazarul -2282m, and Tulisa-1782m),Nature reserves in Romania - Page 18 Emil Pop, N. \\"ending with Mount Tulisa (1,795 m.) at the eastern end of the massif, overlooking the Romanian Jiu Valley and the Petrosani Basin.\\" and to the south by peaks of the V√¢lcan Mountains (Coarnele-1789m and Siglaul Mare-1682m).

The trains travel across the Appalachian Mountains, through Pennsylvania's capital Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, suburban and central Philadelphia, and New Jersey en route to New York. The entire train ride takes about 9 hours total, with 1.5 hours between New York and Philadelphia, 2 hours between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, and 5.5 hours between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvanian uses the same Amtrak-owned Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line as the Keystone Service trains, but continues further west via the Pittsburgh Line through Altoona and the Allegheny Mountains, eventually terminating its run in Pittsburgh. The Main Line and Pittsburgh Line collectively make up the Keystone Corridor, a federally-designated corridor for high speed rail service. During fiscal year 2016, the Pennsylvanian carried 223,114 passengers, a 3.7% decrease over FY2015. The train had a total revenue of $11,555,451 during FY2016, up 0.2% from FY2015.  History  Prior to Amtrak, the Pennsylvanian route was covered by the Duquesne, named after Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, and by the Juniata, both trains operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad and from 1968 to 1971 by the PRR's successor, the Penn Central.Pennsylvania timetable, August 1950, Table 39 The Duquesne had a long history, finally becoming a daily New York‚ÄìPittsburgh train on October 25, 1959, numbered 16 eastbound and 25 westbound. When the Pennsylvania Railroad's successor, Penn Central, was formed in 1968, it continued to operate the Duquesne and the Juniata.Penn Central East-West timetable, October, 1968 With the start of Amtrak operations on May 1, 1971, the Duquesne was renamed the Keystone and renumbered 42 westbound and 43 eastbound with the first Amtrak timetable on November 14, 1971. The Keystone was discontinued on April 30, 1972. The immediate impetus for the Pennsylvanian was the discontinuance of the National Limited, a New York‚ÄìKansas City train which had provided service over the corridor. That train, in turn, was the successor of the famed Spirit of St Louis. The Pennsylvanian began on April 27, 1980, as a state-supported daylight train between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with connecting service to New York via the Philadelphian (a Clocker) westbound and the Montrealer eastbound. At the time the Pennsylvanian was inaugurated, the Broadway Limited was departing Pittsburgh at an inconvenient early morning hour. The new train ran with Amfleet equipment, including a cafe car. Pennsylvania agreed to pay 20% of the train's costs for the first year, or $580,000, with the state and Amtrak eventually splitting the costs 50/50 by the third year. Between 1981 and 1983, Pennsylvanian equipment was turned every night to operate a second state- supported train, the Fort Pitt, which ran from Pittsburgh to Altoona. Amtrak withdrew this train in early 1983 after the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) declined to continue subsidizing the increased operation. At the time the Fort Pitt carried 30 passengers per day. On October 30, 1983, the Pennsylvanian was extended to New York City, eliminating the transfer at Philadelphia. Genesis powered Amtrak Pennsylvanian passing Rosemont, Pennsylvania After significant ridership gains in 1984, PennDOT proposed that a second train be added to the route. PennDOT and Amtrak would have split the costs evenly. Amtrak officials were favorable, but budget problems stalled the plan. In the late 1980s passenger-rail groups urged Amtrak to extend the Pennsylvanian to Cleveland, Ohio. Proposals included new stations in Sewickley and Beaver Falls. Pressure increased in 1989 when Amtrak announced the re-routing of the Broadway Limited and Capitol Limited over that same route as part of a restructuring of routes in Indiana. As part of this change, the Capitol Limited began serving the Cleveland‚ÄìPittsburgh route, albeit in the middle of the night. Amtrak and PennDOT considered two routes for an extended Pennsylvanian: one via Alliance, Ohio (following the route of the Capitol Limited) and one via Youngstown, Ohio (partially following the Broadway Limited) with a new stop in New Castle, Pennsylvania. On November 7, 1998, Amtrak extended the Pennsylvanian through to Chicago along the route of the Capitol Limited via Toledo, finally bringing a daylight connection to Cleveland. The Three Rivers continued to run over a different schedule via Akron and Fostoria. As part of the change Amtrak truncated the eastern end to Philadelphia, enabling the train to complete the run within a single day. The change was driven by Amtrak's growing mail and express business; Pittsburgh‚ÄìPhiladelphia ridership suffered. Amtrak returned the Pennsylvanian to the New York‚ÄìPittsburgh route on January 27, 2003, citing low ridership and Amtrak's withdrawal from the express freight business. On November 1, 2004, Amtrak merged the Pennsylvanian and Three Rivers, keeping the latter name with a western terminus in Chicago. Amtrak had sought $2.5 million in assistance from Pennsylvania to keep both trains running. On March 8, 2005, Amtrak truncated service to Pittsburgh‚ÄìNew York and restored the Pennsylvanian name to the route. The eastbound Pennsylvanian passes through Cassandra, PennsylvaniaThere is currently no through service west of Pittsburgh, though the Capitol Limited continues to provide service to Chicago. As part of its federally mandated analysis of the worst-performing long-distance routes, Amtrak determined that reinstating a through-car connection with the Pennsylvanian would result in the highest gain in monetary and customer service measurements of possible options. To implement this, Amtrak plans to operate a Viewliner sleeper car, an Amfleet cafe car and two Amfleet coaches between Chicago and New York approximating the historic Broadway Limited, via the Capitol Limited and Pennsylvanian. This would begin when funding and equipment is available. On January 28, 2011, it was announced that Pennsylvania had received a $750,000 grant from the federal government to study expanding service westwards from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh along the route of the Pennsylvanian, including higher speeds and additional frequencies. The train has been primarily financed by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation since October 1, 2013, when the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 took effect. This federal law eliminated federal subsidies for Amtrak routes less than in length. In March 2020, service on the Pennsylvanian was suspended as part of a round of service reduction in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Service resumed on June 1, 2020.  Ridership  Over fiscal years 2009‚Äì2016, ridership grew from 199,484 to 223,114, an increase of 10.6%. Ridership peaked at 231,720 in FY 2015. Ticket revenue grew from $7,819,404 to $11,555,451, an increase of 47.8%.  Equipment  On its inauguration the Pennsylvanian ran with then-new Amfleet equipment: two coaches and a cafe. Today the Pennsylvanian continues to use an all-Amfleet consist although the number of coaches has grown to six. The train consists of an Amfleet I business class car, an Amfleet I cafe car, an Amfleet I coach, and three Amfleet II long-distance coach cars. Motive power is usually a Genesis diesel-electric locomotive west of Philadelphia. East of Philadelphia, the motive power is a Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotive; an engine swap is made at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia. A Viewliner II baggage car was added to the train in October 2019.

It was withdrawn from medicinal use as dangerous from the 1970s (e.g., withdrawn in Canada in 1973, and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1983). History Phenacetin was introduced in 1887 in Elberfeld, Germany by German company Bayer, and was used principally as an analgesic; it was one of the first synthetic fever reducers to go on the market. It is also known historically to be one of the first non-opioid analgesics without anti- inflammatory properties. Prior to World War One, Britain imported phenacetin from Germany. During the war, a team including Jocelyn Field Thorpe and Martha Annie Whiteley developed a synthesis in Britain. Known mechanism of action Phenacetin's analgesic effects are due to its actions on the sensory tracts of the spinal cord. In addition, phenacetin has a depressant action on the heart, where it acts as a negative inotrope. It is an antipyretic, acting on the brain to decrease the temperature set point. It is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (subacute type) and intercostal neuralgia. It is metabolized in the body to paracetamol (acetaminophen), which is also a clinically relevant analgesic. Preparation The first synthesis was reported in 1878 by Harmon Northrop Morse. Phenacetin may be synthesized as an example of the Williamson ether synthesis: ethyl iodide, paracetamol, and anhydrous potassium carbonate are heated in 2-butanone to give the crude product, which is recrystallized from water. Uses Vicks cold tablets, containing: salicylamide, phenacetin 2¬Ω grs., pyrilamine maleate, caffeine, ephedrine sulphate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide complex (U.S. Pat. 2,446,981). That patent number is from 1948; these tablets would have been made shortly thereafter. Phenacetin was widely used until the third quarter of the twentieth century, often in the form of an A.P.C., or \\"aspirin-phenacetin- caffeine\\" compound analgesic, as a remedy for fever and pain. An early formulation (1919) was Vincent's APC in Australia. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration ordered the withdrawal of drugs containing phenacetin in November 1983, due to its carcinogenic and kidney-damaging properties.Federal Register of October 5, 1983 (48 FR 45466) It was also banned in India. As a result, some branded, and previously phenacetin-based, preparations continued to be sold, but with the phenacetin replaced by safer alternatives. A popular brand of phenacetin was Roche's Saridon, which was reformulated in 1983 to contain propyphenazone, paracetamol and caffeine. Coricidin was also reformulated without phenacetin. Paracetamol is a metabolite of phenacetin with similar analgesic and antipyretic effects, but the new formulation has not been found to have phenacetin's carcinogenicity. Phenacetin has been used as a cutting agent to adulterate cocaine in the UK and Canada, due to the similar physical properties. Due to its low cost, phenacetin is used for research into the physical and refractive properties of crystals. It is an ideal compound for this type of research. In Canada phenacetin is used as a laboratory reagent, and in a few hair dye preparations (as a stabilizer for hydrogen peroxide). While it is considered a prescription drug, no marketed drugs contain phenacetin. Safety Phenacetin, and products containing phenacetin, have been shown in an animal model to have the side effect and after-effect of carcinogenesis. In humans, many case reports have implicated products containing phenacetin in urothelial neoplasms, especially urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis. Phenacetin is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as carcinogenic to humans. In one prospective series, phenacetin was associated with an increased risk of death due to urologic or renal diseases, death due to cancers, and death due to cardiovascular diseases. In addition, people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may experience acute hemolysis, or dissolution of blood cells, while taking this drug. Acute hemolysis is possible in the case of patients who develop an IgM response to phenacetin leading to immune complexes that bind to erythrocytes in blood. The erythrocytes are then lysed when the complexes activate the complement system. Chronic use of phenacetin is known to lead to analgesic nephropathy characterized by renal papillary necrosis. This is a condition which results in destruction of some or all of the renal papillae in the kidneys. It is believed that the metabolite p-phenetidine is at least partly responsible for these effects. One notable death that can possibly be attributed to the use of this drug was that of the aviation pioneer Howard Hughes. He had been using phenacetin extensively for the treatment of chronic pain; it was stated during his autopsy that phenacetin use may have been the cause of his kidney failure.

It was discovered by Edward Pigott in March 1779, and independently by Johann Elert Bode in April of the same year, as well as by Charles Messier in 1780. A dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus gave rise to its nicknames of the \\"Black Eye\\" or \\"Evil Eye\\" galaxy. M64 is well known among amateur astronomers because of its appearance in small telescopes. This galaxy is inclined 60¬∞ to the line-of-sight and has a position angle of 112¬∞. At the distance of this galaxy, it has a linear scale of per arcsecond. The morphological classification of NGC 4826 in the De Vaucouleurs system is (R)SA(rs)ab, where the '(R)' indicates an outer ring-like structure, 'SA' denotes a non-barred spiral, '(rs)' means a transitional inner ring/spiral structure, and 'ab' says the spiral arms are fairly tightly wound. Ann et al. (2015) gave it a class of SABa, suggesting a weakly barred spiral galaxy with tightly wound arms. M64 is a type 2 Seyfert galaxy with an HII/LINER nucleus. The central region is a weak source of radio emission. A soft X-ray source has been detected at the nucleus, which is most likely coming from the circumnuclear region rather than directly from an active galactic nucleus. There is an inner disk of molecular gas that is truncated at a radius of . At present, the non-rotational motions of this disk do not significantly feed the core, but the disk does produce a vigorous rate of star formation, with also approximately 100 billion stars inside the galaxy. There is also evidence of a recent large inflow of mass. The interstellar medium of Messier 64 consists of two counter-rotating disks that are approximately equal in mass. The inner disk contains the prominent dust lanes of the galaxy. The stellar population of the galaxy exhibits no measurable counter-rotation. Possible formation scenarios include a merger with a gas-rich satellite galaxy in a retrograde orbit, or the continued accretion of gas clouds from the intergalactic medium. It has a diameter of .

She was the grandmother of Apollo, the god of the Sun, and Artemis, goddess of the moon, and was, like her granddaughter Artemis, identified by the Romans poets with the Roman moon-goddess Diana.Boyle, p. 147. Mythology Phoebe is a Titaness whose consort was her brother Coeus, with whom she had two daughters, Leto, who bore Apollo and Artemis, and Asteria, a star-goddess who bore an only daughter, Hecate.Hesiod, Theogony 404‚Äì452. Given the meaning of her name and her association with the Delphic oracle, Phoebe was perhaps seen as the Titan goddess of prophecy and oracular intellect. Through Leto, Phoebe was the grandmother of Apollo and Artemis. The names Phoebe and Phoebus (masculine) came to be applied as synonyms for Artemis and Apollo respectively (as well as for Selene and Helios).Compare the relation of the comparatively obscure archaic figure of Pallas and Pallas Athena. According to a speech, that Aeschylus in The Eumenides puts in the mouth of the Delphic priestess herself, Phoebe received control of the Oracle at Delphi from Themis: \\"Phoebe in this succession seems to be his private invention,\\" D. S. Robertson noted, reasoning that in the three great allotments of oracular powers at Delphi, corresponding to the three generations of the gods, \\"Ouranos, as was fitting, gave the oracle to his wife Gaia and Kronos appropriately allotted it to his sister Themis.\\"Robertson, p. 70. In Zeus' turn to make the gift, Robertson speculates, Aeschylus could not report that the oracle was given directly to Apollo, who had not yet been born, and thus Phoebe was interposed.Robertson, p. 70. These supposed male delegations of the powers at Delphi as expressed by Aeschylus are not borne out by the usual modern reconstruction of the sacred site's pre-Olympian history.

Most of the Rock's upper area is covered by a nature reserve, which is home to around 300 Barbary macaques. These macaques, as well as a labyrinthine network of tunnels, attract many tourists each year. The Rock of Gibraltar was one of the two Pillars of Hercules and was known to the Romans as Mons Calpe, the other pillar being Mons Abyla or Jebel Musa on the African side of the Strait. According to ancient myths fostered by the Greeks and the Phoenicians, and later perpetuated by the Romans, the two points marked the limit to the known world. Actually, the Phoenicians had sailed beyond this point into the Atlantic, both northward and southward. Gibraltar is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea. Geology Levant cloud forming against the eastern cliffs of the Rock of Gibraltar The Rock of Gibraltar is a monolithic promontory. The Main Ridge has a sharp crest with peaks over 400 m above sea level, formed by Early Jurassic limestones and dolomites. It is a deeply eroded and highly faulted limb of an overturned fold. The sedimentary strata composing the Rock of Gibraltar are overturned, with the oldest strata overlying the youngest strata. These strata are the Catalan Bay Shale Formation (youngest), Gibraltar Limestone, Little Bay Shale Formation (oldest), and Dockyard Shale Formation (age unknown). These strata are noticeably faulted and deformed. Predominantly of shale, the Catalan Bay Shale Formation also contains thick units composed of either brown calcareous sandstone, soft shaly sandstone interbedded with bluish-black limestone, and interlayered greenish-gray marls and dark gray cherts. The Catalan Bay Shale Formation contains unidentifiable echinoid spines and belemnite fragments and infrequent Early Jurassic (Middle Lias) ammonites. The Gibraltar limestone consists of greyish-white or pale-gray compact, and sometime finely crystalline, medium to thick bedded limestones and dolomites that locally contain chert seams. This formation comprises about three quarters of the Rock of Gibraltar. Geologists have found various poorly preserved and badly eroded and rolled marine fossils within it. The fossils found in the Gibraltar limestone include various brachiopods, corals, echinoid fragments, gastropods, pelecypods, and stromatolites. These fossils indicate an Early Jurassic age (Lower Lias) for the deposition of the Gibraltar limestone. The Little Bay and Dockyard shale formations form a very minor part of the Rock of Gibraltar. The Little Bay Shale Formation consists of dark bluish-gray, unfossiliferous shale, which is interbedded with thin layers of grit, mudstone, and limestone. It predates the Gibraltar limestone. The Dockyard Shale Formation is an undescribed variegated shale of unknown age that lies buried beneath the Gibraltar's dockyard and coastal protection structures. Although these geological formations were deposited during the early part of the Jurassic Period some 175-200million years ago, their current appearance is due to far more recent events of about 5 million years ago. When the African tectonic plate collided tightly with the Eurasian plate, the Mediterranean became a lake that, over the course of time, dried up during the Messinian salinity crisis. The Atlantic Ocean then broke through the Strait of Gibraltar, and the resultant flooding created the Mediterranean Sea. The Rock forms part of the Betic Cordillera, a mountain range that dominates southeastern Iberia. The sheer east side of the Rock of Gibraltar Today, the Rock of Gibraltar forms a peninsula jutting out into the Strait of Gibraltar from the southern coast of Spain. The promontory is linked to the continent by means of a sandy tombolo with a maximum elevation of . To the north, the Rock rises vertically from sea level up to at Rock Gun Battery. The Rock's highest point stands near the south end above the strait at O'Hara's Battery. The Rock's central peak, Signal Hill and the top station of the Gibraltar Cable Car, stands at an elevation of . The near-cliffs along the eastern side of the Rock drop down to a series of wind-blown sand slopes that date to the glaciations when sea levels were lower than today, and a sandy plain extended east from the base of the Rock. The western face, where the City of Gibraltar is located, is comparatively less steep. Calcite, the mineral that makes up limestone, dissolves slowly in rainwater. Over time, this process can form caves. For this reason the Rock of Gibraltar contains over 100 caves. St. Michael's Cave, located halfway up the western slope of the Rock, is the most prominent and is a popular tourist attraction. Fossils of Neanderthals have been found at several sites in Gibraltar. In 1848, a Neanderthal woman's skull was found at Forbes' Quarry, located on the north face of the Rock. However, its significance was not recognized until after the 1856 discovery of the type specimen in the Neander Valley. Excavations in Gorham's Cave, located near sea level on the eastern side of the Rock, found evidence it was used by Neanderthals, and plant and animal remains in the cave gave evidence of Neanderthals' highly varied diet. Fortification The Moorish Castle Moorish Castle The Moorish Castle is a relic of Moorish rule over Gibraltar, which lasted for 710 years. It was built in the year A.D. 711, when the Berber chieftain Tariq ibn-Ziyad first landed on the rock that still bears his name. The 17th-century Muslim historian Al-Maqqari wrote that upon landing, Tariq burned his ships. The principal building that remains is the Tower of Homage, a massive building of brick and very hard concrete called tapia. The upper part of the tower housed the former occupants' living apartments and Moorish bath. The Rock of Gibraltar's North Front cliff face from Bayside (c.1810) showing the embrasures in the Rock Galleries A unique feature of the Rock is its system of underground passages, known as the Galleries or the Great Siege Tunnels. The first of these was dug towards the end of the Great Siege of Gibraltar, which lasted from 1779 to 1783. General Elliot, afterwards Lord Heathfield, who commanded the garrison throughout the siege, was anxious to bring flanking fire on the Spanish batteries in the plain below the North face of the Rock. On the suggestion of Sergeant-Major Henry Ince of the Royal Engineers, he had a tunnel bored from a point above Willis's Battery to communicate with the Notch, a natural projection from the North face. The plan was to mount a battery there. There was no intention at first of making embrasures in this tunnel, but an opening was found necessary for ventilation; as soon as it had been made a gun was mounted in it. By the end of the siege, the British had constructed six such embrasures, and mounted four guns. The Galleries, which tourists may visit, were a later development of the same idea and were finished in 1797. They consist of a whole system of halls, embrasures, and passages, of a total length of nearly . From them, one may see a series of unique views of the Bay of Gibraltar, the isthmus, and Spain. Second World War onwards When World War II broke out in 1939, the authorities evacuated the civilian population to Morocco, the United Kingdom, Jamaica, and Madeira so that the military could fortify Gibraltar against a possible German attack. By 1942 there were over 30,000 British soldiers, sailors, and airmen on the Rock. They expanded the tunnel system and made the Rock a keystone in the defense of shipping routes to the Mediterranean. In February 1997, it was revealed the British had a secret plan called Operation Tracer to conceal servicemen in tunnels beneath the Rock in case the Germans captured it. The team in the rock would have radio equipment with which to report enemy movements. A six-man team waited undercover at Gibraltar for two and a half years. The Germans never got close to capturing the rock and so the men were never sealed inside. The team was disbanded to resume civilian life when the war ended. Sayings 1909 insurance advertisement The saying \\"solid as the Rock of Gibraltar\\" is used to describe an entity that is very safe or firm. The motto of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment and Gibraltar itself is Nulli Expugnabilis Hosti (Latin for \\"No Enemy Shall Expel Us\\"). Nature reserve Barbary macaque feeding her young at Mediterranean Steps, on the Rock of Gibraltar Approximately 40% of Gibraltar's land area was declared a nature reserve in 1993. Flora and fauna The flora and fauna of the Gibraltar Nature Reserve are of conservation interest and are protected by law. Within it is a range of animals and plants, but the highlights are the Barbary macaques (the famous Rock apes), the Barbary partridges, and flowers such as Gibraltar's own chickweed, thyme and the Gibraltar candytuft. The Barbary macaques may have originated from an escape of North African animals transported to Spain; it is also possible that the original Gibraltar macaques are a remnant of populations that are known to have spread throughout Southern Europe during the Pliocene, up to 5.5 million years ago. Some animals of the Rock have been reintroduced by the Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park who have three Barbary macaques. =Birds= The Rock of Gibraltar, at the head of the Strait, is a prominent headland, which accumulates migrating birds during the passage periods. The vegetation on the Rock, unique in southern Iberia, provides a temporary home for many species of migratory birds that stop to rest and feed before continuing migration for their crossing over the sea and desert. In spring, they return to replenish before continuing their journeys to Western Europe, journeys which may take them as far as Greenland or Russia. The Rock has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International, because it is a migratory bottleneck, or choke point, for an estimated 250,000 raptors that cross the Strait annually, and because it supports breeding populations of Barbary partridges and lesser kestrels.

It forms the second half of a pair with the television serial Karaoke. The two serials were filmed as a single production by the same team; both were directed by Renny Rye and feature Albert Finney as the writer Daniel Feeld. The plays were unique in being co-productions between the BBC and Channel 4, something Potter had expressly requested before his death. The show was first aired on Channel 4 in 1996 on Sunday evenings, with a repeat on BBC1 the following day. Parts of Karaoke and Cold Lazarus were filmed in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, which is where Dennis Potter was born and raised, and children from local schools including St. Briavels Parochial Primary School appeared in the film as extras in flashbacks. Both series are available to watch online via the Channel 4 website. Both Karaoke and Cold Lazarus were released on DVD from Acorn Media in September 2010. Plot Cold Lazarus is set in the 24th century, in a dystopian Britain where the ruined streets are unsafe, and where society is run by American oligarchs in charge of powerful commercial corporations. Experiences are almost all virtual, and anything deemed authentic (such as coffee and cigarettes) has either been banned or replaced by synthetic substitutes. At a cryonics research institute in London, funded by the pharmaceuticals tycoon Martina Masdon (played by Diane Ladd), a group of scientists led by Dr. Emma Porlock (Frances de la Tour) is working on reviving the mind of the 20th-century writer Daniel Feeld (Albert Finney), whose head was frozen after Feeld's death shortly after the events of Karaoke. Unable to see any profit in the project, Masdon considers discontinuing it, but the media mogul David Siltz (Henry Goodman), who has been spying on Masdon, envisages making a fortune from broadcasting Feeld's memories on TV, and proposes to Porlock that her team work for him. Porlock is unaware that a member of her team, Fyodor Glazunov (Ciar√°n Hinds) is a member of the resistance group RON (‚ÄòReality Or Nothing‚Äô), which attempts to undermine the reliance of society upon advanced technology by carrying out violent attacks. Glazunov identifies Kaya, another of Porlock's team, as a potential recruit to his superior Andrew Milton (David Foxxe), but Milton kills Kaya, believing her unsuitable. Angered by Kaya's murder, Glazunov kills Milton. Porlock then discovers the truth about Glazunov but, to distract him from the possibility of killing her, consults with him about the Siltz deal. Glazunov approves of the broadcast of Feeld's memories, which he believes might provoke a revolt against the 'inauthentic' life propagated by the authorities. It is shortly after this that Porlock accepts Siltz's offer, just as Masdon realises the potential of the Lazarus project. As more of Feeld's thoughts and memories are unearthed, it becomes evident not only that Feeld's mind is conscious of its predicament, but also that Feeld is attempting to communicate with the scientists, and is pleading to be allowed to die. At this point Glazunov, Porlock and Luanda Partington (another long standing member of the team) begin to doubt the morality of their project. Another of their team, Watson, having been coerced into informing on his colleagues, unwittingly denounces Glazunov as a RON member and saboteur. Having been warned, Glazunov heads for the laboratory to put Feeld out of his misery. In the confrontation that ensues, Glazunov is able to kill Siltz, and, after a final communication with Feeld (in which they make eye contact), he destroys the laboratory, Feeld's head, and himself, in the process.

Hughes. \\"Women, politics, and power: a global perspective\\". Pine Forge Press, 2007, p. 151. Provisions are written into the Afghanistan Constitution (Article 14) aimed at improving the welfare of Kochis, including provisions for housing, representation, and education. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, before the 30 years of war, Kochis owned 30 per cent of the country's goats and sheep and most of the camels for years, and they were largely responsible for the supply of slaughter animals, wool, ghee and quroot to the national economy.UNHCR, Formation of 4 Kuchi sheep/goat breeders‚Äô service centres, Durable solutions for Kuchi IDP's in the south of Afghanistan: Options and opportunities, Asia Consultants International, pg. 15 US army medic vaccinating Kochi children, Gardez, 2003.

They were awarded \\"firman,\\" or royal proclamations, granting them use of summer pastures all over Afghanistan including the northern parts of the country.Lansford, Tom (2003) A Bitter Harvest: US foreign policy and Afghanistan Ashgate, Aldershot, Hants, England, , page 16: \\"The modern history of Afghanistan has witnessed a \\"Pashtunization\\" of the state as the customs, traditions and language of the Pashtuns have combined with the groups political power to erode the distinctive underpinnings of Afghanistan's other groups.FN20\\".

Roy, Ethnic Identity and Political Expression in Northern Afghanistan, in Muslims in Central Asia: Expressions of Identity and Change, 1992, .Afghanistan, by Gilles Dorronsoro During the Taliban era, Kochis were a main factor and supporter of the Taliban and their leader Mohammed Omar As a result, the northern ethnic groups (Hazara, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Turkmens) have a long- standing distrust of the Kochi. This political dispute has been deepened over the decades of Kochi transhumance, whereby some Kochis became absentee landlords in their summer areas in the north through customary seizure procedures to attach debtors' land. However, the Kochis themselves see the northern minority groups as a non-Afghan race, and claims the Kochis were natives of northern Afghan region, and that during many years of invasion such as Genghis Khan and Timur, they escaped south. Kochis have been identified by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan as one of the largest vulnerable populations in the country. As Afghanistan's population grows, competing claims over summer pastures, both for rainfed cultivation and for grazing of the settled communities' livestock, have created conflict over land across central and northern Afghanistan. Paying head-count fees for each animal crossing someone else's property is exacting a harsh economic toll on the Kochi way of life, one that is already having to contend with recurrent droughts that are now occurring with increasing frequency.http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayarticleNew.asp?section=todaysfeatures&xfile;=data/todaysfeatures/2008/August/todaysfeatures_August9.xml There are communities of Pashtun Kochi origin in other parts of the world as well, including in the Caribbean, Africa and Europe.

The pound is subdivided into 100 qirsh (, plural: , qur≈´sh, piastres in English or French), although coins in qirsh are no longer issued. The standard abbreviation for the Syrian pound is SYP. Before 1947, the word qirsh was spelled with the initial Arabic letter ÿ∫, after which the word began with ŸÇ. Until 1958, banknotes were issued with Arabic on the obverse and French on the reverse. After 1958, English has been used on the reverses, hence the three different names for this currency. Coins used both Arabic and French until independence, then only Arabic.  History  During the period when Syria was a part of the Ottoman Empire, which lasted about 400 years, the Ottoman lira was its main currency. Following the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the placing of Syria under a mandate (French occupation), the Egyptian pound was used in the territories under French and British mandates, including Lebanon, Transjordan and Palestine. Upon taking Lebanon and Syria under its separate mandate, the French government sought to replace the Egyptian currency and granted a commercial bank, the Banque de Syrie (a French affiliate of the Ottoman Bank), the authority to issue a currency for territories under its new mandate. The pound (or livre as it was then known) was introduced in 1919 and was pegged at a value of 20 French francs. As the political status of Lebanon evolved, the Banque de Syrie, which was to act as the official bank for Lebanon and Syria, was renamed the Banque de Syrie et du Grand-Liban (BSL). BSL issued the Syro- Lebanese pound for 15 years, starting in 1924. Two years before the expiration of the 15-year period, BSL split the Lebanese-Syrian currency into two separate currencies that could still be used interchangeably in either state. In 1939, the bank was renamed the Banque de Syrie et du Liban. In 1941, the peg to the French franc was replaced by a peg to the British pound of 8.83125 Syrian pounds = 1 British pound, as a consequence of the occupation of Syria by British and Free French forces. This rate was based on the pre-war conversion rate between the franc and sterling. In 1946, following devaluation of the franc, the pound was pegged once again to the franc at a rate of 1 pound = 54.35 francs. In 1947, Syria joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar at 2.19148 pounds = 1 dollar, a rate which was maintained until 1961. The Lebanese and Syrian currencies split in 1948. From 1961, a series of official exchange rates were in operation, alongside a parallel, black market rate which reflected the true market rate for Syrian pounds in Jordan and Lebanon where there was a healthy trade in the Syrian currency. The market was allowed to flourish because everybody, including government and public sector companies, needed it. The black market rate diverged dramatically from the official rate in the 1980s.Syria: The businessman can't play his hand Euromoney May 1986. In July 2007, the currency was pegged to the IMF SDR (Special Drawing Rights).Syria ends pound's peg to U.S. dollar BLOOMBERG JUNE 5, 2007  Syrian Civil War  thumb There was a capital flight to nearby countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, as a result of the Syrian Civil War that started in 2011. In addition, Syria has been subject to sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and other countries, which shut Syria out of the global financial system. To circumvent the sanctions, Syrians effected foreign transactions through banks in neighbouring countries, especially Lebanon. As a result, the official exchange rate has deteriorated significantly, falling from 47 SYP = US$1 in March 2011 to 515 SYP = US$1 in July 2017. On 31 October 2019, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad mentioned in an interview that: Exchange rate On 5 December 2005, the selling rate quoted by the Commercial Bank of Syria was 48.4 SYP = US$1. A rate of about 50 SYP to US$1 was usual in the early 2000s, but the rate is subject to fluctuations. Since the start of the civil war in 2011, the pound's unofficial exchange rate has deteriorated significantly. It was 47 SYP = US$1 in March 2011 and 515 SYP in July 2017. Since July 2007, the Syrian pound has been pegged to the IMF SDR (Special Drawing Rights).Syria ends pound's peg to U.S. dollar BLOOMBERG JUNE 5, 2007 On 29 November 2019, following the Lebanese protests, the black market rate was 765 SYP = US$1, a decrease of 30% since the turmoil started in Lebanon a month earlier, as the protests led Lebanese banks to impose tight controls on hard currency withdrawals and transfers abroad, making it hard for Syrians to access funds held by them in those banks. The black-market rate fell to 950 SYP on 2 December 2019, another 25% decrease, while the official rate set by the central bank was 434 SYP = US$1. On 13 January 2020, the currency deteriorated further, as more than 1000 SYP was traded for US$1 in the black market, despite being valued at 434 SYP = US$1 by the Syrian Central Bank. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Syria, the Syrian pound continued to fall against the U.S. dollar in the black market, where US$1 equaled more than 1600 SYP in May 2020. A month later, the Syrian pound passed 2000 against the dollar, and a few days later, it passed 3000 against the dollar. Upon the implementation of the U.S. sanctions related to the Caesar Act, anti- government local authorities in Idlib Governorate adopted the Turkish lira in place of the plummeting Syrian pound. Coins In 1921, cupro-nickel qirsh coins were introduced, followed in 1926 by aluminium bronze 2 and 5 qirsh. In 1929, holed, nickel-brass 1 qirsh and silver 10, 25 and 50 qirsha were introduced. Nickel-brass qirsh were introduced 1935, followed by zinc 1 qirsh and aluminium-bronze 2¬Ω qirsh in 1940. During the Second World War, brass 1 qirsh and aluminium qirsh emergency coins were issued. These pieces were crudely produced and undated. A new coinage was introduced between 1947 and 1948 in denominations of , 5, 10, 25 and 50 qirsha and 1 pound, with the , 5 and 10 qirush struck in cupro-nickel and the others in silver. Aluminium- bronze replaced cupro-nickel in 1960, with nickel replacing silver in 1968. In 1996, following high inflation, new coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 25 pounds, with the 25 pounds a bimetallic coin. In 2003 5, 10, and 25 pound coins were issued, with latent images. On December 26, 2018, the Central Bank of Syria introduced a 50 Syrian pounds coin for general circulation and to also replace the banknote of said denomination.50 Liras Numista (https://en.numista.com).

These were followed, in 1920, by notes for 1 qirsh and 10, 25, 50 and 100 livres. In 1925, the Banque de Syrie et du Grand-Liban began issuing notes and production of denominations below 25 qirsha ceased. Notes below 1 livre were not issued from 1930. In 1939, the issuing body again changed its name, to the Banque de Syrie et du Liban. Between 1942 and 1944, the government introduced notes for 5, 10, 25 and 50 qirsha. In the early 1950s, undated notes were issued by the Institut d'Emission de Syrie in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 livres, followed by notes dated 1955 for 10 and 25 livres. The Banque Centrale de Syrie took over paper money issuance in 1957, issuing the same denominations as the Institut d'Emission. In 1958, the French language was removed from banknotes and replaced by English. Notes were issued for 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 pounds. In 1966, the design of the 25, 50, and 100 pound notes was changed. In 1976 and 1977, the designs changed for all the denominations except the 500-pound note. In 1997 and 1998, a new series of notes was introduced in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 pounds, with the lower denominations replaced by coins. In 2009, the 50, 100, and 200 pound notes were changed with an entirely new design. In 2014 a new 500 pound note has been released, followed by a new 1000 note in 2015.

Created in 1298 for John de Clinton, it is the seventh-oldest barony in England. Creation and early history The peerage of Baron Clinton was created in 1298 for Sir John de Clinton, 1st Baron Clinton, a knight who had served in the Scottish and French wars. The peerage was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. It is thus one of the most ancient English titles still in existence. William, the younger son of the first Baron, was also summoned to parliament by writ on 6 September 1330 as Baron de Clynton, even though his elder brother, the second Baron, was sitting in parliament under the same title. He was created Earl of Huntingdon in 1337. The second Baron, John, fought with the king's army, which defeated Edward II's cousin Thomas, Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1321. He was knighted by 1324. The third Baron fought at the Battle of Poitiers in the Hundred Years' War and was the Constable of Warwick Castle 1390-97. He married at least three times. His first wife, Idonea de Saye, was the daughter of Geoffrey de Saye, 2nd Lord Saye. He was succeeded in the barony by their grandson, son of their son Sir William Clinton (DVP 25 October 1383). In 1399, upon the death of fourth Baron's cousin, Elizabeth de Saye de Falvesley Heron, Baroness Saye, the fourth Baron succeeded to the Saye lands and styled himself Lord Saye. He married three times; firstly, to Anne Trivett, daughter of Sir Thomas Trivett; secondly, to Alice or Anne FitzWarin, daughter of 2nd Baron Botreaux and the widow of 6th Lord Fitzwarin; and thirdly to Mary Retford, widow of Sir Henry Retford. He was succeeded by his son from his second marriage. The fifth Baron fought on the Yorkist side in the Wars of the Roses. He was attainted in 1461 but later restored to his title. The sixth Baron was recognised in 1471 as Lord Clinton and Saye, but was not called to Parliament under either title. He married Elisabeth, daughter of Sir Richard Fiennes, and took Fiennes as an alias, and Clinton and Saye baronies continued to be linked for several generations. The 10th and 11th Barons were called to Parliament as Baron Clinton de Saye. Edward Clinton, 9th Baron Clinton was created Earl of Lincoln in 1572. The titles remained united until 1692 upon the death of his great- great-great-grandson, Edward de Clinton, fifth Earl of Lincoln and 13th Baron Clinton. The earldom was inherited by the late Earl's cousin, the sixth Earl (see the Earl of Lincoln for later history of this title) while the barony fell into abeyance between the issue of his two aunts, Lady Margaret Clinton (d. 1688) and Lady Arabella Clinton, the daughters of Theophilus de Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln and 12th Baron Clinton, a brother-in-law of Charles I.

Motto: Forte Scutum Salus Ducum (\\"A Strong Shield is the Salvation of Leaders\\")Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p. 461. The abeyance of 1692 was terminated in 1721 in favour of Hugh Fortescue (d. 1751), fourteenth Baron Clinton, the grandson of Lady Margaret Clinton (d. 1688), the eldest daughter of Theophilus de Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln and 12th Baron Clinton (d. 1667). Lady Margaret had married Hugh Boscawen (1625‚Äì1701), MP, of Tregothnan in Cornwall, and their daughter Bridget Boscawen (d. 1708) married Hugh Fortescue (1665‚Äì1719) (son of Arthur Fortescue by Barbara Elford) and had issue Sir Hugh Fortescue (d. 1751). In 1746, he was created Baron Fortescue, of Castle Hill in the County of Devon (with remainder to his half-brother Matthew Fortescue) and Earl Clinton, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. The Earl was childless and on his death the earldom of Clinton became extinct but his two baronies continued. He was succeeded in the barony of Fortescue (according to the special remainder) by his half-brother, the second Baron Fortescue (see Earl Fortescue for later history of this title). The barony of Clinton was inherited by his second cousin Margaret Rolle, 15th Baroness Clinton, the granddaughter of Lady Arabella Clinton, the younger daughter of Theophilus de Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln and 12th Baron Clinton (d. 1667). Margaret Rolle was the widow of Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford (d. 1751) and the daughter of Samuel Rolle, the son of Robert Rolle (d. 1660), MP, of Heanton Satchville, Devon, by his wife Lady Arabella Clinton. She was succeeded by her son, George Walpole, third Earl of Orford and 16th Baron Clinton (d. 1791). He was childless and on his death in 1791 the earldom passed to his uncle, the fourth Earl of Orford (see the Earl of Orford for later history of this title), while the barony of Clinton became dormant. Barony dormant The barony, which had been dormant since 1791, was successfully claimed in 1794 by the late Earl of Orford's cousin Robert George William Trefusis (1764‚Äì1797), who became the 17th Baron Clinton. He was the three-times great-grandson of Lady Arabella Clinton, the younger daughter of the fourth Earl of Lincoln. Lady Arabella's daughter Bridget Rolle had married Francis Trefusis of Trefusis in Cornwall, and had issue Samuel Trefusis (1677‚Äì1724), whose great-grandson was the 17th Baron Clinton. The 18th Baron served as aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War. He was succeeded by his younger brother, who represented Callington in the House of Commons, in which role he was notable. He was succeeded by his son, the 20th Baron Clinton (1834‚Äì1904). He served as Under-Secretary of State for India from 1867 to 1868 in the Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli and was also Lord Lieutenant of Devonshire. In 1867 Baron Clinton assumed by Royal licence the additional surnames of Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes, which were those of his father-in-law. His son, the 21st Baron, held minor office in the coalition government of David Lloyd George and served as Lord Warden of the Stannaries. Barony into second abeyance Following the death of the 21st Baron Clinton on 5 July 1957, the barony fell into abeyance between his two daughters: The Hon. Harriet Fane (14 November 1887 ‚Äì 15 March 1958), who married Maj. Henry Nevile Fane, only son of Sir Edmund Fane (whom she divorced in 1935); and the Hon. Fenella Bowes- Lyon (19 August 1889 ‚Äì 19 July 1966), an aunt of Queen Elizabeth II through her marriage to John Bowes-Lyon, second son of the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. The abeyance of 1957 was terminated 18 March 1965 in favour of Gerald Neville Mark Fane Trefusis, the 22nd Lord Clinton, who is the great- grandson of the 21st Baron Clinton and grandson of Hon. Harriet Fane. His great-aunt Fenella supported his eight-year legal fight to succeed as baron. Baron Clinton had already in 1958 assumed by deed poll the additional surname of Trefusis and had inherited the 85,000-acre estate in Devon from his great- grandfather. Residences The family seat is Heanton Satchville, Huish, near Merton in North Devon, which was built in 1782 as \\"Innis House\\" by Sir James Innis, Duke of Roxburgh, and was purchased by the 18th Baron Clinton in about 1805, renamed Heanton Satchville, which burned down in 1935 and was rebuilt. After the death of Hon. Mark Rolle in 1907, Bicton House became the main residence of the 21st Baron Clinton until his death in 1957,Delderfield, p. 80. where much grand entertaining occurred until the start of World War II and where a herd of 150 deer were kept in the park. The Duke and Duchess of York spent part of their honeymoon there.Delderfield, Eric R., West Country Historic Houses and their Families, Newton Abbot, 1968, p. 11, Bicton House. The 1st Baron resided at Maxstoke Castle, Warwickshire, the inheritance of his wife. The 5th Baron exchanged it for lands in Northamptonshire. The 9th Baron's chief seat was in Lincolnshire on an estate which was the inheritance of his wife Elizabeth Blount.Lauder, Rosemary, Devon Families, Tiverton, 2002, pp. 65‚Äì66. The seat of the 14th Baron Clinton was Castle Hill, Filleigh, rebuilt by him in the Palladian style. The seat of the 15th Baroness was Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe, the ancient Rolle seat, although she spent the later part of her life on the Continent, having left her first husband, and died in Pisa.Lauder, Rosemary, Devon Families, Tiverton, 2002, p. 67. Her son the 16th Baron largely abandoned that residence in favour of Houghton Hall in Norfolk. Although he had the legal power to do so, he did not end the tail- male of the Rolle estates, and the estates thus passed to the Trefusis family not to his own heirs male the Lords Cholmondely, heirs to the Walpole estates, who unsuccessfully claimed the Rolle estates from the 18th Baron Clinton in a lengthy court case.Lauder, Rosemary, Devon Families, Tiverton, 2002, p. 69. Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe became the seat of the 17th Baron only for a short time as it burnt down in 1795 and he died two years later. His son the 18th Baron when he came of age purchased Innes House on the other side of a marshy valley in the parish of Huish and renamed it Heanton Satchville.

The borders of the plant beds may be formed with stone or tightly pruned hedging, and their interiors may be planted with flowers or other plants or filled with mulch or gravel. The paths are constituted with gravel or turf grass. French parterres originated in the gardens of the French Renaissance of the 15th century and often had the form of knot gardens. Later, in the 17th century Baroque garden, they became more elaborate and stylised. The French parterre reached its greatest development at the Palace of Versailles, which inspired many similar parterres throughout Europe. History Claude Mollet, the founder of a dynasty of nurserymen-designers that lasted into the 18th century, developed the parterre in France. His inspiration in developing the 16th-century patterned compartimens, i. e. simple interlaces formed of herbs, either open and infilled with sand, or closed and filled with flowers, was the painter Etienne du P√©rac, who returned from Italy to the Ch√¢teau d'Anet near Dreux, France where he and Mollet were working. C. 1595 Mollet introduced compartment-patterned parterres to the royal gardens of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Fontainebleau; the fully developed scrolling embroidery-like parterres en broderie first appear in Alexandre Francini's engraved views of the revised horticultural plans of Fontainebleau and Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1614. Modern parterre at Birr Castle, Ireland Clipped boxwood met with resistance from horticultural patrons for its \\"naughtie smell\\" as the herbalist Gervase Markham described it. By 1638, Jacques Boyceau described the range of designs in boxwood that a horticulturist should be able to cultivate: > Parterres are the low embellishments of gardens, which have great grace, > especially when seen from an elevated position: they are made of borders of > several shrubs and sub-shrubs of various colours, fashioned in different > manners, as compartments, foliage, embroideries (passements), moresques, > arabesques, grotesques, guilloches, rosettes, sunbursts (gloires), > escutcheons, coats-of-arms, monograms and emblems (devises).Jacques Boyceau, > Trait√© du iardinage selon les raisons de la nature et de l‚Äôart, pp. 81-2, as > quoted by [Mark?] Laird. By the 1630s, elaborate parterres de broderie appeared at Wilton House in Wilton, England that were so magnificent that they were engraved, which engraving is the only remaining trace of them. \\"Parterres de pelouse\\" or \\"parterres de gazon\\" denominate cutwork parterres of low growing herbs, e. g. camomile, as much as closely scythed turf grass. The separation of plant beds of a pareterre is denominated an \\"alley of compartiment\\". Parterre gardens lost favour in the 18th century and were superseded by naturalistic English landscape gardens, which emerged in England in the 1720s. However, in the 19th century parterre gardens were revived, coinciding with the rise of Neo- Renaissance architecture and the fashion for carpet bedding, which was realized by the annual mass planting of non-hardy flowers as segments of color which constituted a design. Level substrates and a raised vantage point from which to view the design were required, and so the parterre was revived in a modified style. Examples Parterre at Cliveden with restored 19th-century style planting Parterre at Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire, viewed from a first floor window. At Kensington Palace the planting of the parterres was by Henry Wise, whose nursery was nearby at Brompton. In an engraving from 1707‚Äì1708, (illustration, right), the up-to-date Baroque designs of each section are clipped scrolling designs, symmetrical around a centre, in low hedging punctuated by trees formally clipped into cones; however, their traditional 17th century layout, a broad central gravel walk dividing paired plats, each subdivided in four, appears to have survived from the Palace's former (pre-1689) existence as Nottingham House. Subsidiary wings have subsidiary parterres, with no attempt at overall integration. At Prince Eugene's Belvedere Palace, Vienna, a sunken parterre before the fa√ßade that faced the city was flanked in a traditional fashion with raised walks from which the pattern could best be appreciated. To either side, walls with busts on herm pedestals backed by young trees screen the parterre from the flanking garden spaces. Formal baroque patterns have given way to symmetrical paired free scrolling rococo arabesques, against the gravel ground. Little attempt seems to have been made to fit the framework to the shape of the parterre. Beyond (in the shadowed near foreground) paired basins have central jets of water. In the UK, modern parterres exist at Trereife House in Penzance (Cornwall), at Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire and at Bodysgallen Hall near Llandudno.Trereife Park Examples can also be found in Ireland, such as at Birr Castle. One of the largest in Britain is at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, which covers an area of ; it consists of symmetrical wedge-shaped beds filled with Nepeta (\\"catmint\\"), Santolina and Senecio, edged with box hedges. Sentinel pyramids of yew stand at the corners. Some early knot gardens have been covered over by lawn or other landscaping but the traces are visible as undulations in the present day landscape. An example of this phenomenon is the early 17th-century garden of Muchalls Castle in Scotland. At Charlecote Park in Warwickshire the original parterre from the 1800s has been recreated on the terrace overlooking the river.

Reflexology, also known as zone therapy, is an alternative medical practice involving the application of pressure to specific points on the feet and hands. This is done using specific thumb, finger, and hand massage techniques without the use of oil or lotion. It is based on a pseudoscientific system of zones and reflex areas that purportedly reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with the premise that such work on the feet and hands causes a physical change to the supposedly related areas of the body. There is no convincing scientific evidence that reflexology is effective for any medical condition. Definition In a Cochrane Collaboration review, reflexology is defined as follows: \\"Reflexology is gentle manipulation or pressing on certain parts of the foot to produce an effect elsewhere in the body.\\" The Australian Government's Department of Health define reflexology as \\"a system of applying pressure, usually to the feet, which practitioners believe stimulates energy and releases 'blockages' in specific areas that cause pain or illness.\\" Effectiveness In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; reflexology was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Accordingly, in 2017, the Australian government named reflexology as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would \\"ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence\\". Reviews from 2009 and 2011 have not found evidence sufficient to support the use of reflexology for any medical condition. A 2009 systematic review of randomized controlled trials concludes: \\"The best evidence available to date does not demonstrate convincingly that reflexology is an effective treatment for any medical condition.\\" Claimed mechanism There is no consensus among reflexologists on how reflexology is supposed to work; a unifying theme is the idea that areas on the foot correspond to areas of the body, and that by manipulating these one can improve health through one's qi. Reflexologists divide the body into ten equal vertical zones, five on the right and five on the left. Concerns have been raised by medical professionals that treating potentially serious illnesses with reflexology, which has no proven efficacy, could delay the seeking of appropriate medical treatment. Reflexologists posit that the blockage of an energy field, invisible life force, or Qi, can prevent healing. Another tenet of reflexology is the belief that practitioners can relieve stress and pain in other parts of the body through the manipulation of the feet. One claimed explanation is that the pressure received in the feet may send signals that 'balance' the nervous system or release chemicals such as endorphins that reduce stress and pain. These hypotheses are rejected by the medical community, who cite a lack of scientific evidence and the well-tested germ theory of disease. Reflexology's claim to manipulate energy (Qi) is unsupported by science; there is no scientific evidence for the existence of life energy (Qi), 'energy balance', 'crystalline structures,' or 'pathways' in the body. In Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial, Simon Singh states that if indeed the hands and feet \\"reflect\\" the internal organs, reflexology might be expected to explain how such \\"reflection\\" was derived from the process of Darwinian natural selection; but Singh says that no argument or evidence has been adduced.Singh, Simon; Ernst, Edzard (2008). Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial. Transworld. . An example of a reflexology chart of the hand, demonstrating the areas that practitioners believe correspond with organs in the \\"zones\\" of the body. Regulation In the United Kingdom, reflexology is coordinated on a voluntary basis by the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC). Registrants are required to meet Standards of Proficiency outlined by Profession Specific Boards,CNHC ‚Äì Policies but since CNHC is voluntary anyone practicing can describe themselves as a reflexologist. When the CNHC began admitting reflexologists, a skeptic searched for, and found, 14 of them who were claiming efficacy on illnesses. Once pointed out, the CNHC had the claims retracted as it conflicted with the UK's Advertising Standards Authority code.CNHC Wishes to Thank Simon Perry, adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.com, Friday, 27 November 2009 Reflexology is one of the most used alternative therapies in Denmark. A national survey from 2005 showed that 21.4% of the Danish population had used reflexology at some point in life and 6.1% had used reflexology within the previous year.Reflexology in Denmark text from Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicine a Danish governmental institution A study from Norway showed that 5.6% of the Norwegian population in 2007 had used reflexology within the last 12 months.Nifab-unders√∏gelsen in Norwegian only History Practices resembling reflexology may have existed in previous historical periods. Similar practices have been documented in the histories of China and Egypt. Reflexology was introduced to the United States in 1913 by William H.

It includes , , , durability and optimization. It is included with computer-aided design (CAD) and computer- aided manufacturing (CAM) in the collective abbreviation \\"CAx\\".  Overview  Computer aided engineering primarily uses Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, which are sometimes called CAE tools. CAE tools are being used, for example, to analyse the robustness and performance of components and assemblies. The term encompasses simulation, validation, and optimisation of products and manufacturing tools. In the future, CAE systems will be major providers of information to help support design teams in decision making. Computer-aided engineering is used in many fields such as automotive, aviation, space, and shipbuilding industries. In regard to information networks, CAE systems are individually considered a single node on a total information network and each node may interact with other nodes on the network. CAE systems can provide support to businesses. This is achieved by the use of reference architectures and their ability to place information views on the business process. Reference architecture is the basis from which information model, especially product and manufacturing models. The term CAE has also been used by some in the past to describe the use of computer technology within engineering in a broader sense than just engineering analysis. It was in this context that the term was coined by Jason Lemon, founder of SDRC in the late 1970s. This definition is however better known today by the terms CAx and PLM.  CAE fields and phases  CAE areas covered include: *Stress analysis on components and assemblies using Finite Element Analysis (FEA); *Thermal and fluid flow analysis Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); *Multibody dynamics (MBD) and Kinematics; *Analysis tools for process simulation for operations such as casting, molding, and die press forming. *Optimization of the product or process. In general, there are three phases in any computer-aided engineering task: *Pre-processing - defining the model and environmental factors to be applied to it. (typically a finite element model, but facet, voxel and thin sheet methods are also used) *Analysis solver (usually performed on high powered computers) *Post-processing of results (using visualization tools) This cycle is iterated, often many times, either manually or with the use of commercial optimization software. CAE in the automotive industry CAE tools are very widely used in the automotive industry. In fact, their use has enabled the automakers to reduce product development cost and time while improving the safety, comfort, and durability of the vehicles they produce. The predictive capability of CAE tools has progressed to the point where much of the design verification is now done using computer simulations (diagnosis) rather than physical prototype testing. CAE dependability is based upon all proper assumptions as inputs and must identify critical inputs (BJ). Even though there have been many advances in CAE, and it is widely used in the engineering field, physical testing is still a must. It is used for verification and model updating, to accurately define loads and boundary conditions and for final prototype sign-off. The future of CAE in the product development process Even though CAE has built a strong reputation as a verification, troubleshooting and analysis tool, there is still a perception that sufficiently accurate results come rather late in the design cycle to really drive the design. This can be expected to become a problem as modern products become ever more complex. They include smart systems, which leads to an increased need for multi-physics analysis including controls, and contain new lightweight materials, to which engineers are often less familiar. CAE software companies and manufacturers are constantly looking for tools and process improvements to change this situation. On the software side, they are constantly looking to develop more powerful solvers, better use computer resources and include engineering knowledge in pre- and post- processing. On the process side, they try to achieve a better alignment between 3D CAE, 1D System Simulation and physical testing. This should increase modeling realism and calculation speed. On top of that, they try to better integrate CAE in the overall product lifecycle management. In this way, they can connect product design with product use, which is an absolute must for smart products. Such an enhanced engineering process is also referred to as predictive engineering analytics.

It was created in 1299 for Robert de Clifford (c.1274‚Äì1314), feudal baron of CliffordVivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.)

English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086‚Äì1327, Oxford, 1960, p.143 in Yorkshire and feudal baron of ApplebySanders, p.104 in Westmoreland. The title was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. The Norman family which later took the name de Clifford settled in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066 and was first seated in England at Clifford Castle in Herefordshire. The first Baron served as Earl Marshal of England but was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. His 8th generation descendant the 11th Baron, was created Earl of Cumberland in 1525, whose grandson the 3rd Earl was a noted naval commander. On the latter's death in 1605 the earldom passed to his younger brother, the 4th Earl (see the Earl of Cumberland for later history of this title). George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, 13th Baron de Clifford The barony of de Clifford was claimed in 1628 by his daughter and only child, Lady Anne Clifford, but the House of Lords postponed the hearing. The barony remained dormant until 1678, when Nicholas Tufton, 3rd Earl of Thanet, was allowed to claim the peerage and became the fifteenth Baron de Clifford. He was the son of Lady Margaret Sackville, daughter of the aforementioned Anne Clifford. On the death of the Earl's younger brother, the sixth Earl, in 1721, the earldom and barony separated. The earldom was inherited by the late Earl's nephew, the seventh Earl (see the Earl of Thanet for further information on this title). The barony fell into abeyance between the Earl's five daughters, Lady Katherine, Lady Anne, Lady Isabel, Lady Margaret and Lady Mary. It remained in abeyance until 1734 when the abeyance was terminated in favour of the third daughter, Margaret, who became the nineteenth Baroness.London Gazette 1734 She was the wife of Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester. On her death in 1775 the title again fell into abeyance, this time between her sisters and their heirs. The abeyance was terminated only a year later in favour of Edward Southwell, the 20th Baron. He was the grandson of Lady Catherine Tufton, eldest daughter of the sixth Earl of Thanet. He was succeeded by his son, the 21st Baron. He was childless and on his death in 1832 the barony fell into abeyance between his sisters Hon. Sophia Southwell and Hon. Elizabeth Southwell and the heirs of his deceased sister Hon. Catherine Southwell. The peerage was called out of abeyance in 1833 in favour of Sophia Coussmaker, the twenty-second holder. She was the only surviving child of Hon. Catherine Southwell and her husband George Coussmaker. The 22nd baroness was the wife of John Russell, third son of Lord William Russell, third son of Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock, eldest son and heir of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford. She was succeeded by her son, the 23rd Baron, Liberal Member of Parliament for Tavistock. , the title is held by his great-great-great-grandson, the 28th Baron who succeeded his uncle in that year. Other members of the Clifford family have been created barons, namely as Baron Clifford (created 1628, in abeyance since 1858) and Baron Clifford of Chudleigh (created 1672), which title is extant and which family is the senior surviving branch of the Norman de Clifford family of Clifford Castle. Members of the family have also been created baronets as Baronet Clifford of Flaxbourne, New Zealand, Baronet Clifford of the Navy and Baronet Clifford-Constable of Tixall, Staffordshire.

Preview audiences are selected from a cross-section of the population and are usually asked to complete a questionnaire or provide feedback in some form. Harold Lloyd is credited with inventing the concept, having used it as early as 1928. Test screenings have been recommended for starting filmmakers \\"even if a film festival is fast approaching\\". Notable examples and outcomes of test screenings In 2004, Roger Ebert, the late reviewer for the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote that test screenings by filmmakers are \\"valid\\" to get an idea of an audience response to a rough cut. But \\"too often, however, studio executives use preview screenings as a weapon to enforce their views on directors, and countless movies have had stupid happy endings tacked on after such screenings.\\" Ebert writes that Billy Wilder dropped the first reel from Sunset Boulevard after a test screening. Producer Tim Bevan emphasizes that the goal of the film editing process is to turn unedited film \\"into 85 to 110 minutes of story that people are going to want to go and see\\", and he \\"absolutely believes in the testing process. 99.9 times out of 100 the audience will speak louder than anybody else\\". Even though \\"editing rooms can be very combative places\\" with directors, the test results make the process \\"less combative.\\" While filming Johnny English (2003) with director Peter Howitt, testing led to reshoots of the beginning of the film to set up the character better, and \\"test scores leaped considerably.\\" Edgar Wright, writer and director of Shaun of the Dead, said in an interview that in test screenings done before the film's special effects were completed, audiences remarked that the ending was \\"a bit abrupt\\" and \\"lame\\".Jones; Jolliffe. p. 634. After being given a low budget and two days to finish shooting, the filmmakers added a \\"15 second\\" ending, which follow-up press screening audiences liked, leading to one reviewer changing his earlier bad review, giving \\"an extra star\\". Dan Myrick and Ed Sanchez, directors of The Blair Witch Project said, \\"We had a 2 1/2 hour cut [...] We had no idea what we had, so we had to show it to an audience and get their reaction.\\" At this screening, the filmmakers met their future producer.Jones; Jolliffe. p. 638. Feedback from a test screening may be used to alter the movie before it is released. This may be as simple as changing the title of the film (as in the case of the film that became Licence to Kill), or it may be more substantial. Cases exist of where test screenings prompted filmmakers to completely change the ending of a movie (by having a character die who would have survived, or vice versa, for instance); examples include Little Shop of Horrors, Mary Poppins, Final Destination, Fatal Attraction, Deep Blue Sea, I Am Legend, Titanic and Pretty in Pink. Test screenings showed negative audience reactions to onscreen kissing between Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts (in The Pelican Brief); the test response to his onscreen kiss with Mimi Rogers (in The Mighty Quinn) led to the scene being cut. Director John Carpenter has been quoted as saying \\"We've just had a test screening, and the upshot is we're throwing out the first reel, and starting with reel two\\" during the pre- dubbing for Escape from New York. In a test screening for the Harrison Ford spy thriller Clear and Present Danger, the audience started to applaud during the main villain's climactic death scene, but \\"it was over before they could\\"; this resulted in reshoots. According to the director, Phillip Noyce, screening a trimmed-down version of the film for test audiences resulted in \\"more people thinking it was longer, than when it was long\\", supporting the studio's insistence on a 142-minute version. Different test audiences can produce startlingly different results. After agreeing on what they thought would be a final \\"lean and mean\\" cut, and validating it with a test audience, producer/screenwriter Chris Jones and director Genevieve Jolliffe, of Urban Ghost Story, presented a test screening for some \\"industry people\\", who declared the film \\"too slow.\\"Jones; Jolliffe. p. 607. This result caused the two filmmakers to argue extensively between themselves, but they tried cutting 15 minutes from the first 25, the \\"baggy\\" part. Jones relates that the results left them with \\"our jaws on the floor, saying 'why on earth did we leave all that junk in?'\\" According to a June 2008 article from The Guardian, \\"Two weeks before [the release of The Bourne Supremacy (2004)], [director Paul Greengrass] got together with its star, Matt Damon, came up with a new ending and phoned the producers saying the new idea was \\"way\\" better, it would cost $200,000 and involve pulling Damon from the set of Ocean's 12 for a re-shoot. Reluctantly the producers agreed‚Äîthe movie tested 10 points higher with the new ending\\". During test screenings of Wolfgang Petersen's Troy, test audiences reacted negatively to the film. The producers reported that audiences listed Gabriel Yared's unfinished score as a factor, calling it \\"too brassy and bold\\" and \\"too old fashioned\\". On the screening prints, Yared's score had lacked the intended choir parts to balance the \\"brassy\\" parts. The filmmakers sought a replacement composer before informing Yared of his firing, and asked James Horner to write a new score in two weeks. In later reviews, several film score critics describe Yared's score as superior to Horner's. Director Ridley Scott \\"snuck in\\" to the first test screening of American Gangster and stayed because \\"no one moved\\" in the audience, indicating that they were \\"fully engaged\\". Some screenings are intended only to determine how best to market a film; director Kevin Smith writes that he \\"hates\\" test screenings, and \\"doesn't know any filmmaker\\" who enjoys the process, but describes a very good audience response and focus group in Kansas City, MO at the sole marketing test screening for Clerks II. In television, test screenings may be used before a series debuts, to help fine-tune the concept (as with Sesame Street, leading to the Muppets appearing onscreen with human characters, rather than in separate segments), or to pre-test specific episodes. Adam West in his book Back to the Batcave stated that test screenings for the 1960s Batman television series incorporated audience- controlled dials monitored by computer. Shown to about one hundred recruited audience members, the pilot episode received \\"the worst score in the history of pilot testing\\", in the \\"high 40s\\", where the average pilot score was in the mid-60s. Several adjustments were made to the show and retested, including a laugh track, then narration; the test results were the same. The decision was made to add \\"huge new special effects gags that would look great in promos.\\" Wes Craven's film Deadly Friend had a test screening by Warner Bros. that was set up for audiences mostly consisting of Craven's fans, as he had a large fan base after the critical and commercial success of his previous theatrically- released film, A Nightmare on Elm Street. The audience reaction was overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the lack of graphic violence and gore that was shown in Craven's previous films. Warner Bros. eventually discovered Craven's fan base and forced writer Bruce Joel Rubin to write six additional splatter sequences into his script. Craven and Rubin virtually disowned the film by that point. During post-production of Carlo Carlei's 2013 adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, test screening audiences disliked the film, and cited James Horner's score as one of its weaknesses. After the film's producers argued with Carlei about replacing the score, they commissioned Abel Korzeniowski to write a replacement score. The film was once again screened, with one version having Horner's score, the other having Korzeniowski's new score. The producers then chose to reject Horner's score because the screening with Korzeniowski's score had gotten higher ratings from the audience.http://www.filmtracks.com/scoreboard/forum.cgi?read=5299 See also *Film screening *Screener *Pomona ¬ß In popular culture References Category:Film production Category:Film editing Category:Types of polling ","title":"Test screening"},{"id":"456742","text":"Herbert Czaja (November 5, 1914 - April 18, 1997) was a German Christian democratic politician. Czaja was born to a multi-ethnic and multilingual family in Cieszyn in Poland, which was part of Austria-Hungary at the time of his birth. During the Second Polish Republic he was politically active in the German Christian People's Party, a centrist party representing German-speaking Catholics in Poland, and obtained a doctorate in philology from the Jagiellonian University. In 1946 he was expelled from his native Poland by the communist regime during the expulsion of Germans after World War II and came as a refugee to Stuttgart in West Germany, where he worked as a teacher and became active in politics for the Christian Democratic Union. He served as a member of the city council of Stuttgart from 1947 to 1953, as a member of the Bundestag from 1953 to 1990, was a long-time member of the Central Committee of German Catholics from 1948, and was President of the Federation of Expellees from 1970 to 1994. His political activity focused both on the refugees from Eastern Europe and on Catholic affairs. In the official propaganda of the Polish People's Republic, Czaja was portrayed as one of West Germany's most important politicians and his influence often exaggerated. After the Cold War, Czaja was involved in Polish-German reconciliation efforts. He was awarded the Knight Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1984.  Early life in Austria-Hungary and Poland  Herbert Czaja was born in Teschen (Cieszyn) in Austria-Hungary to a bilingual family of Polish, Czech and German origin. Cieszyn was a typically multi-ethnic city where many had both Polish and German (Austrian) roots. His father Albert Czaja was a respected notary who was fluent in Polish, German and Czech;Dr. Herbert Czaja his mother was Louise n√©e Smekal. His father's name Czaja is Polish, while his mother's name Smekal is of Czech origin.Dr Herbert Czaja Herbert Czaja became a Polish citizen at age four when his hometown became part of the Second Polish Republic. He was fluent in Polish and German. Czaja studied German studies, history, and philosophy in Vienna and Krak√≥w. Influenced by his bilingual family and upbringing, he became interested in minority issues, and during the 1930s, he was active in German student organisations in the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship of Poland, as a member of Senator Eduard Pant's German Christian People's Party, a Catholic party working for the interests of the German minority in Poland. In 1937, he joined the German Association for the National Pacification of Europe, an anti-Nazi group in Poland founded by Eduard Pant. At the same time, he worked as a teacher in eastern Upper Silesia. In 1939, before the start of World War II, he received his doctorate in German literature at the Jagiellonian University with the dissertation Stefan Georges Ringen um autonomes Menschentum (\\"The struggle of Stefan George for autonomous humanity\\"). His doctoral advisor was Adam Kleczkowski, one of Poland's most respected German studies scholars. He then briefly worked as a scientific assistant at the Jagiellonian University. During World War II, when his hometown was annexed by Germany, he was considered part of the ethnic German community by the German authorities. From October 1940 to March 1941 Czaja worked as a secondary school teacher in Zakopane and then from March 1941 to May 1942 in Przemy≈õl. He continued to be involved in anti-Nazi activities, but fearing prosecution for treason and upon the advice of a friend, he volunteered for the Wehrmacht in 1942 to get away from Silesia, serving until he was severely wounded in early 1945. Expulsion from Poland When Czaja returned to Cieszyn, his parents' home had been destroyed, communists had taken control over Poland and the situation of ethnic Germans in Silesia was dire. The boundaries between Germans and Poles were blurry in multi-ethnic families like the Czajas, and Czaja appears to initially have been considered Polish upon his return to his hometown. Czaja's mentor and doctoral advisor Adam Kleczkowski offered him a position at the Jagiellonian University to undertake a Habilitation, but Czaja would be required to declare Polish nationality. Under the circumstances of ethnic persecution of the group he felt most attached to and a communist dictatorship now in place in Poland, Czaja was unwilling to declare Polish nationality. Shortly after in 1946, Czaja was expelled by the Polish People's Republic authorities during the expulsion of Germans after World War II. Political career in West Germany Herbert Czaja settled in Stuttgart, where he immediately became involved in politics for the Christian Democratic Union and its youth wing, the Junge Union. He was a member of the city council of Stuttgart from 1947 to 1953. He also co-founded the Union of Expellees in the CDU and chaired the branch in Northern W√ºrttemberg. In 1948 he was elected a member of the Central Committee of German Catholics, an office he held for decades. His political career in West Germany focused equally on refugee affairs and on Catholic issues. He was also a central member of the Ackermann Community, a Catholic organisation promoting ties between Germans and Czechs. He served as a member of the Bundestag, the Parliament of West Germany, from 1953 to 1990. During this time he represented Stuttgart-Nord from 1983 to 1990. He also served as spokesman of the Landsmannschaft der Oberschlesier from 1969 and was president of the Federation of Expellees (Bund der Vertriebenen, BdV) from 1970 to 1994. In the 1970s and 1980s, Czaja voted, along with several conservative politicians, against the recognition of the Oder-Neisse line as the Polish-German definitive border in 1990, and argued that the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany with the territory of the former German Democratic Republic was not a complete reunification according to the German constitution of 1949, as it did not include the eastern provinces of Germany as of 1937. Czaja proposed to establish out of Western Poland an autonomous zone under international administration.Jeszcze Steinbach nie zginƒô≈Ça 09-03-2009 Rzeczpospolita During the Cold War, Herbert Czaja figured prominently in the official state propaganda of the communist regime of the People's Republic of Poland, and was often portrayed as an enemy of the state. His influence in West German politics was often exaggerated by the Polish communists. After the end of the Cold War, he was active in Polish- German reconciliation efforts in the 1990s, and worked as an adviser for the authorities of Opole Voivodeship in modern Poland. While promoting ethnic peace between Poles and Germans, he maintained that the historically eastern German provinces could in the future be reunited with Germany, as he repeated in his 1996 book Unterwegs zum kleinsten Deutschland? Czaja however stated that no expulsions may ever be repeated; that millions of Poles had lived in a German state before and could so once again if these lands would be reintegrated into Germany. Czaja explicitly called for a Centre against Expulsions in Berlin to be established by Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic in a joint effort to promote peace and reconciliation. Family Czaja died in Stuttgart in 1997, survived by a wife and ten children. His oldest daughter, Christine Maria Czaja, published a biography of her father in 2003, titled Herbert Czaja: Anwalt f√ºr Menschenrechte (Herbert Czaja: Advocate for Human Rights). Honours Herbert Czaja was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1968. He was awarded the Commander's Cross of the same order in 1973 and the Knight Commander's Cross in 1984. He was awarded the Medal of Merit of Baden- W√ºrttemberg in 1988. A street in Stuttgart, Dr.-Herbert‚ÄìCzaja-Weg, was named in his honour in 2002.  Literature  * Christine Maria Czaja (2003): Herbert Czaja: Anwalt f√ºr Menschenrechte.

It was created in 1313 for Robert de Willoughby. Since 1983, the title has been held by Jane Heathcote-Drummond- Willoughby, 28th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby. History The title of Baron Willoughby was created by writ in 1313 for Robert de Willoughby, lord of the manor of Eresby in the parish of Spilsby, Lincolnshire. He was the son of Sir William de Willoughby and Alice, daughter of John Beke, 1st Baron Beke of Eresby. The writ was addressed to \\"Roberto de Wylghby,\\" and the suffix of de Eresby was added to the title between 1350-1360 to distinguish it from other members of the de Willoughby family. The fourteenth Baron was created Earl of Lindsey in 1626. His great-grandson, the fourth Earl and seventeenth Baron, was created Marquess of Lindsey in 1706 and Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven in 1715. On the death of the first Duke's great-grandson, the fourth Duke, the Dukedom, Marquessate and Earldom were inherited by his uncle, while the Barony of Willoughby de Eresby fell into abeyance between the late Duke's sisters Lady Priscilla and Lady Georgiana. In 1780, the title was called out of abeyance in favour of Priscilla. She was the wife of Peter Burrell, 1st Baron Gwydyr. Their son Peter inherited both Baronies. On the death of Peter's only son Albyric, the Barony of Gwydyr was passed on to a cousin, while the Barony of Willoughby de Eresby fell into abeyance between his sisters Clementina Drummond-Willoughby, wife of Gilbert John Heathcote, 1st Baron Aveland and Charlotte, wife of Robert Carrington, 2nd Baron Carrington. In 1871 the abeyance was terminated in favour of Clementina. She was succeeded by her and Lord Aveland's son Gilbert, 2nd Baron Aveland and 25th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. In 1892 he was created Earl of Ancaster, a revival of the Ancaster title created for his maternal ancestor in 1715. On the death of his grandson, the third Earl, in 1983, the Earldom and Barony of Aveland became extinct (while the Baronetcy also held by the Earl was passed on to a distant relative), while the Barony of Willoughby de Eresby was inherited by the late Earl's daughter, Nancy, the present holder of the title. Since 1626, the Barony of Willoughby de Eresby has been associated with office of Lord Great Chamberlain. In that year, the first Earl of Lindsey inherited the Great Chamberlainship. Upon the death of the fourth Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, it was divided between his sisters Priscilla and Georgiana (who was later Marchioness of Cholmondeley). Thereafter, the barony of Willoughby de Eresby has been associated with the senior share of the Lord Great Chamberlainship. However, it has not been associated with the highest share. The share belonging to Lady Cholmondeley has been passed intact to her heirs, the Marquesses of Cholmondeley, but Lady Willoughby de Eresby's share has been split between many heirs. As of 2004, only one-fourth of the Lord Great Chamberlainship is possessed by the holder of the barony. The peerage has been held by a woman six times, more than any other peerage except that of Baron de Ros. The family seats are Grimsthorpe Castle in Edenham, near Bourne, Lincolnshire and Drummond Castle, near Crieff, Perthshire, Scotland, originally the family seat of the Drummond earls of Perth.

In the 1870s Anton Novak, an Ethnic German colporteur of the British and Foreign Bible Society, began to meet and study the Scriptures with a group of Reformed Christians in Transylvania. In 1875, Heinrich Meyer baptized eight of them and formed them into a church in Salonta Mare. This was the first Baptist church in Transylvania. The Baptist Union of Romania was formed in 1920, but Saxons, Hungarians, and Rusyn- Ukrainians maintained associations to promote their own interests. The Recognized Hungarian Baptist Union of Romania was founded at Salonta in October 1920. The Unrecognized Hungarian Baptist Union of Romania was formed around the same time in Nu≈üfalƒÉu. In 1922, the Recognized Hungarian Baptist Union associated with the Baptist Union of Romania as a department within it, and also joined the Baptist World Alliance. The two Hungarian Baptist groups united to become the Hungarian Baptist Convention of Romania in 1935. Government instability and change brought varying challenges to the Baptists of Romania, especially from 1955 to 1989, under the Communist regime. During this time believers were harassed, churches closed, ministers threatened, and educational work prohibited. In 1948, the Hungarian Baptist Convention was closed. The Union of the Hungarian Baptist Churches of Romania was organized in Cluj-Napoca on February 3, 1990. In 1996, the name \\"Union\\" was changed to \\"Convention\\". According to Baptist World Alliance statistics, the Convention of the Hungarian Baptist Churches had 8,954 members in 247 churches in 2011. The Convention operates as a \\"sister\\" denomination to the Baptist Union of Romania and is a member of the European Baptist Federation.

Tucker was the chief engineer on the Enterprise and also briefly served in the same role aboard Enterprise's sister ship Columbia. Biography Tucker was born in 2121. His nickname \\"Trip\\" is short for \\"Triple\\", as he is the third generation of his family to be named Charles Tucker. He first met Jonathan Archer around (2143) a decade prior to the launch of Enterprise when the two worked together on an early warp 2 prototype vessel using the warp engine designed by Archer's father, Henry Archer. Tucker joined Starfleet in 2139. While a knowledgeable engineer, Tucker can be rash and \\"illogical\\", an opinion that early on causes friction between Enterprise's Vulcan science officer, T'Pol and him. During the first year of Enterprise's mission, he finds himself coping with situations with which no Starfleet engineer has ever coped, and is a key player in the vessel finally achieving maximum speed of warp 5. Tucker also enjoys occasional romantic relationships, including one with an exotic alien engineer in the episode \\"Unexpected\\". When challenged about these relationships, his stock phrase is, \\"I was a perfect gentleman.\\" He is statistically the greatest charmer aboard the Enterprise and he has gone down in Star Trek history as the first human male ever to be pregnant and the first human male ever to be in a relationship with a member of another species. In the last episode of the second season, Earth was attacked by an alien race called the Xindi. The attack was made by a prototype weapon that struck Florida and caused the deaths of 7 million people, including Tucker's sister. This left Tucker emotionally scarred and unable to sleep without experiencing vivid nightmares. At the request of Dr. Phlox, Tucker agreed to undergo Vulcan neuropressure treatments with T'Pol. Although the treatments required very intimate contact between the two, no signs were seen at first of anything beyond a professional relationship developing between the officers. At a crucial point during the Xindi mission, Tucker suffered a potentially fatal injury, and the only way to save his life was to create a clone to harvest needed brain cells. The clone, named \\"Sim\\", grew to adulthood over only a few days, and many of the crew became fond of him, in particular T'Pol, who actually kissed Sim after he confessed to being attracted to T'Pol ‚Äî but adding that he was uncertain whether those feelings were his own or Tucker's. Against Sim's objections, Archer ordered him to undergo the medical procedure to extract the needed cells to save Tucker's life, though this proved fatal to Sim. As the Xindi mission progressed, Tucker found himself growing closer to T'Pol, and the two briefly became lovers, an event T'Pol later dismissed as an experiment, though the real cause was a side effect of her addiction to the substance Trellium D, which affected her emotional judgment. Tucker admitted to T'Pol's mother he was in love with her daughter during a trip to Vulcan with her after the Xindi mission, during which she decided to marry her fianc√© Koss in an arranged marriage. Although T'Pol's mother encouraged Tucker to express his feelings to her daughter, he chose not to do so. Later, following T'Pol's annulment of her marriage, Tucker considered becoming involved with her again; however. In the episode \\"Observer Effect\\", T'Pol expressed great concern for Tucker, suggesting her feelings for him remained strong, despite her claims to the contrary. In 2154, during a mission to prevent a Romulan automated marauder from starting a war, Tucker determined that his attraction to T'Pol was negatively affecting his ability to do his job. After the mission, he requested, and received, a transfer to the new NX Class starship, Columbia. During this period, Tucker began experiencing vivid daydreams involving T'Pol, without understanding that she was actually unintentionally communicating with him via mental telepathy when she attempted to meditate. In the episode \\"Bound\\", it was revealed that Tucker and T'Pol had become psychically bonded when they had made love a year earlier, although this link apparently did not manifest itself right away. During the events of the episode \\"Divergence\\", Tucker was temporarily reassigned to Enterprise to facilitate repairs following a run-in with the Klingons. He subsequently submitted a request to Archer return to Enterprise full-time. Tucker served as Enterprise's chief engineer for a full decade, and prepared to transfer to one of the newly built warp 7-capable starships following the decommissioning of Enterprise in 2161, which was to coincide with the signing of the Federation Charter. The series finale \\"These Are the Voyages...\\" revealed that Tucker and T'Pol ended their romantic relationship at some point after the events of \\"Terra Prime\\", for reasons as yet unrevealed. Despite this, the two remained close, and Tucker had to reassure T'Pol that the decommissioning of Enterprise and their reassignment to different vessels would not have any bearing on their friendship. In the last episode, when Shran's former associates track down Enterprise and board the ship, they demand that Archer take them to Shran, but the captain refuses. The aliens are about to kill Archer, so Trip, thinking fast, tells them that he will take them to Shran. When Archer protests, the aliens knock him out. Trip leads the aliens into what appears to be a harmless utility closet ‚Äî he tells them it is simply a com station and he is going to get Shran to come to them. Trip tells them he just needs to connect a couple of things, but when he brings a pair of conduits together, a massive explosion erupts, taking out both Trip and the aliens. Trip dies after being fatally wounded. Personal life In 2153, Tucker lost his sister, Elizabeth, in the Xindi attack on Earth which destroyed her hometown in southern Florida. In a first-season episode, \\"Fusion\\", he revealed he had a brother with whom he practiced \\"dancing\\", although he is never seen. His parents survived the attack and later relocated to Mississippi; they were invited to attend the signing of the United Federation of Planets treaty in 2161, and kept their promise to attend even after Tucker's death. T'Pol requested the opportunity to meet them at this occasion, but if she did is not known, At least three offspring have ‚Äî directly or indirectly ‚Äî been linked to Tucker: * In 2151, Tucker was accidentally impregnated by a Xyrillian female, but had the unborn fetus transplanted into another Xyrillian before it was born. The offspring was not genetically related to Tucker as Xyrillian reproduction only uses the mother's genes. No further information about this offspring has been revealed. (\\"Unexpected\\") * In an alternate timeline in the episode \\"E¬≤\\", at some point following an incident that sent Enterprise back to the year 2037, Tucker and T'Pol marry and have a son, Lorian, whose fate after the restoration of the timeline has yet to be revealed. * In 2155, in the episode \\"Demons\\", Tucker learns that he has a six-month-old daughter, the mother apparently being T'Pol. It was revealed that the daughter was cloned using Tucker and T'Pol's DNA, which was stolen from Enterprise by an infiltrator working for Terra Prime. The cloning procedure was improperly executed, however, and the daughter ‚Äî whom T'Pol named \\"Elizabeth\\" after Tucker's sister ‚Äî died soon after being rescued. The child's death left Tucker emotionally devastated as T'Pol ‚Äî herself emotionally drained ‚Äî tried to comfort him. Trip is knowledgeable about the ancient board game Go, and actually has a Go board in his cabin (he is seen playing the game with the title character of the episode \\"Cogenitor\\") Trip has a brief romance with princess Kaitamma (played by Padma Lakshmi) from Krios Prime in \\"Precious Cargo\\", They enjoy a passionate one-night stand when the pair find themselves alone on an uninhabited planet. Although Trip returns to the Enterprise, and she to her own planet, she tells Trip to come visit her on Krios Prime after she becomes ruler. Trip and Malcolm Reed become close friends after being stuck together in Shuttlepod 1 for 3 days after they find evidence that Enterprise was destroyed (Shuttlepod One). Alternate timelines In the alternate timeline seen in the episode \\"Twilight\\", Tucker becomes captain of Enterprise following the incapacitation of Jonathan Archer and T'Pol's resignation from Starfleet. He is killed when Enterprise's bridge is destroyed shortly before Archer resets the timeline. As stated above, the episode \\"E¬≤\\" takes place in an altered timeline. Except that Lorian is the son of T'Pol and Tucker, little else is revealed of the alternate Trip. He is long deceased by the time Lorian's version of Enterprise makes rendezvous with its namesake. Mirror Universe In the Mirror Universe, Tucker is the chief engineer of the ISS Enterprise, but is badly disfigured due to exposure from heavy delta ray radiation emanating from his Enterprise's engines. This version of Tucker also had a sexual relationship with the Mirror T'Pol, who once exploited this relationship in her attempt to sabotage Enterprise; she used a mind meld to implant a posthypnotic suggestion in Tucker's mind. It is implied this is not the first time she has used him in this way. Tucker is subsequently tortured in the agony booth, but vehemently denies any wrongdoing, insisting that he has always been loyal to the Empire and Archer. In the end, Archer tells Reed to break Tucker before releasing him from the booth, much to Tucker's horror. He later confronts T'Pol in main engineering and tells her he spent four hours in the booth. This version of Tucker, along with much of the ISS Enterprise crew, travels to the USS Defiant ‚Äì which had been discovered in the Mirror Universe ‚Äì and tries to get the ship working to further the Mirror Archer's attempt to take over the Terran Empire. Tucker successfully foils a plot by the Mirror Phlox to sabotage key systems aboard Defiant. Novels In the framing story of the Enterprise novel, Last Full Measure (May 2006), it is revealed that Tucker did not actually die in \\"These Are the Voyages...\\", but survived and lived to be over 120 years of age (Tucker meets the young James T. Kirk and his family). The details of this plot point were revealed in the novel The Good That Men Do (written, as was Last Full Measure, by Andy Mangels and Michael A. Martin). In The Good That Men Do, Tucker becomes impatient to do something about the coming Romulan threat to Earth, though Starfleet has ordered Enterprise to return home to bolster the upcoming formation of the Coalition of Planets (a precursor to the United Federation of Planets). Tucker's crewmate, Malcolm Reed, puts him in contact with Harris who operates within Section 31. Tucker agrees to an undercover mission into Romulan territory to find and neutralize the Romulans' new warp 7 engine program, which will be faster than almost all other warp drives in existence (at this time the Vulcans had warp 7 capability) and would undoubtedly endanger the Coalition. He is successful, but in the process, he learns that Vulcans and Romulans were once one species. Tucker reluctantly agrees to remain officially \\"dead\\", lest this secret become public and thereby endanger the newly formed coalition. Also, the novel suggests that Tucker's extended lifespan is partly due to the genetic engineering he receives to pass as a Romulan. In the novel The Romulan War: To Brave the Storm, it is hinted that although Commander Trip Tucker III is officially classified as dead, a small chance existed that he made it out of the escape pod. Resuming his life under an assumed name, he has two children with T'Pol, a son and daughter. Reception In 2009, IGN ranked Trip as the 21st best character of Star Trek. In 2017, Screen Rant ranked the Trip the 13th most attractive person in the Star Trek universe. In 2018, TheWrap ranked Trip Tucker as the 16th best main cast character of Star Trek overall.

First made famous by the French author Chretien de Troyes in the tale Perceval, the Story of the Grail, he is best known for being the original hero in the quest for the Grail, before being replaced in later English and French literature by Galahad. Etymology and origin Percival in Newell Convers Wyeth's illustration for Sidney Lanier's The Boy's King Arthur (1922) The earliest reference to Perceval is in Chr√©tien de Troyes's first Arthurian romance Erec et Enide, where, as \\"Percevaus li Galois\\" (Percevaus of Wales), he appears in a list of Arthur's knights;Erec, vv. 1506, 1526. in another Chr√©tien's romance, Clig√©s, he is a \\"renowned vassal\\" who is defeated by the knight Clig√©s in a tournament.Clig√©s vv. 4774, 4828. He then becomes the protagonist in Chr√©tien's final romance, Perceval, the Story of the Grail. In the Welsh romance Peredur son of Efrawg, the figure goes by the name Peredur. The name \\"Peredur\\" may derive from Welsh par (spear) and dur (hard, steel). It is generally accepted that Peredur was a well-established figure before he became the hero of Peredur son of Efrawg. However, the earliest Welsh Arthurian text, Culhwch and Olwen, does not mention Peredur in any of its extended catalogues of famous and less famous warriors. Peredur does appear in the romance Geraint and Enid, which includes \\"Peredur son of Efrawg\\" in a list of warriors accompanying Geraint. A comparable list in the last pages of The Dream of Rhonabwy refers to a Peredur Paladr Hir (\\"of the Long Spear-Shaft\\"), whom Peter Bartrum identifies as the same figure.Koch, \\"Peredur fab Efrawg\\", pp. 1437‚Äì8. Peredur may derive in part from the sixth-century Coeling chieftain Peredur son of Eliffer. The Peredur of Welsh romance differs from the Coeling chieftain if only in that his father is called Efrawg, rather than Eliffer, and there is no sign of a brother called Gwrgi. Efrawg, on the other hand, is not an ordinary personal name, but the historical Welsh name for the city of York (Latin Eburacum, modern Welsh Efrog). This may represent an epithet that denoted a local association, possibly pointing to Eliffer's son as the prototype, but lstrt came to be understood and used as a patronymic in the Welsh Arthurian tales. Scholars disagree as to the exact relationship between Peredur and Percival. Arthur Groos and Norris J. Lacy argue that it is most likely that the use of the name Peredur in Peredur son of Efrawg \\"represent[s] an attempt to adapt the name [Perceval] to Welsh onomastic traditions\\", as the Welsh romance appears to depend on Chr√©tien de Troyes, at least partially, as a source, and as the name Peredur is attested for unrelated characters in Historia Regum Britanniae and Roman de Brut. Rachel Bromwich, however, regards the name Perceval as a loose French approximation of the Welsh name Peredur. Roger Sherman Loomis attempted to derive both Perceval and Peredur from the Welsh Pryderi, a mythological figure in the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, a derivation that Groos and Lacy find \\"now seems even less likely\\". In all of his appearances, Chr√©tien de Troyes identifies Perceval as \\"the Welshman\\" (li Galois), indicating that, even if he does not originate in Celtic tradition, he alludes to it. Groos and Lacy argue that, \\"even though there may have been a pre-existing 'Perceval prototype,' Chr√©tien was primarily responsible [...] for the creation of [one of] the most fascinating, complex, and productive characters in Arthurian fiction\\". In some French texts, the name \\"Perceval\\" is derived from either Old French per ce val (through this valley) or perce val (pierce the valley). These etymologies are not found in Chr√©tien de Troyes, however. Perlesvaus etymologizes the name (there: Pellesvax) as meaning \\"He Who Has Lost The Vales\\", referring to the loss of land by his father, while also saying Perceval called himself Par-lui-fet (made by himself). Wolfram von Eschenbach's German Parzival provides the meaning \\"right through the middle\\" for the name (there: Parzival). Richard Wagner followed a discredited etymology proposed by journalist and historian Joseph G√∂rres that the name derived from Arabic fal parsi (pure fool) when choosing the spelling \\"Parsifal\\" for the figure in his opera. In Arthurian legend Percival's attributed arms in later stories (following just a plain red shield of the Red Knight in Chr√©tien's Perceval)  Peredur  In a large series of episodes, Peredur son of Efrawg tells the story of Peredur's education as a knight. It begins with his birth and secluded upbringing as a naive boy by his widowed mother. When he meets a group of knights, he joins them on their way to King Arthur's court. Once there, he is ridiculed by Cei and sets out on further adventures, promising to avenge Cei's insults to himself and those who defended him. While travelling he meets two of his uncles. The first, who is analogous to the Gornemant of Perceval, trains him in arms and warns him not to ask the significance of what he sees. The second uncle is analogous to Chr√©tien's Fisher King, but what Peredur sees being carried before him in his uncle's castle is not the Holy Grail (Old French graal), but a salver containing a man's severed head. The text agrees with the French poem in listing a bleeding lance among the items which are carried in procession. The young knight does not ask about significance of these items and proceeds to further adventure, including a stay with the Nine Witches and the encounter with the woman who was to be his true love, Angharad. Peredur returns to Arthur's court, but soon embarks on another series of adventures that do not correspond to material in Perceval. Eventually, the hero learns the severed head at his uncle's court belonged to his cousin, who had been killed by the Witches. Peredur avenges his family and is celebrated as a hero. Several elements in the story, such as the severed head on a salver, a hunt for a unicorn, the witches, and a magical board of gwyddbwyll, have all been described as Celtic ingredients that are not otherwise present in Chr√©tien's story.Lovecy, \\"Historia Peredur\\", p. 178. Goetinck sees in Peredur a variant on the Celtic theme of the sovereignty goddess, who personifies the country and has to be won sexually by the rightful king or heir to secure peace and prosperity for the kingdom. N. Petrovskaia has recently suggested an alternative interpretation, linking the figure of the Empress with Empress Matilda.  Perceval  Arthur Hacker's 1894 illustration of a scene from Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, in which Percival is tempted by a devil in the form of a beautiful woman Chr√©tien de Troyes wrote the first story of Percival, Perceval, the Story of the Grail, in the late 12th century. Wolfram's Parzival, Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, and the now-lost Perceval by Robert de Boron are other famous accounts of his adventures. There are many versions of Perceval's birth. In Robert de Boron's account, he is of noble birth, and his father is stated to be either Alain le Gros, King Pellinore or another worthy knight. His mother is usually unnamed, but plays a significant role in the stories. His sister is sometimes the bearer of the Holy Grail, but not originally; she is sometimes named Dindrane. In the tales in which he is Pellinore's son, his brothers are Aglovale, Lamorak and Dornar, and he also has a half-brother named Tor by his father's affair with a peasant woman. After the death of his father, Perceval's mother takes him to the forest, where she raises him ignorant of the ways of men until he is 15. Eventually, a group of knights passes through the forest and Perceval is struck by their heroic bearing. Wanting to be a knight himself, he travels to King Arthur's court. In some versions, his mother faints in shock upon seeing her son leave. After proving his worthiness as a warrior, he is knighted and invited to join the Knights of the Round Table. In Chr√©tien de Troyes's Perceval, the earliest story about him, he is already connected to the Grail. He meets the crippled Fisher King and sees a grail, not yet identified as \\"holy\\", but he fails to ask the question that would heal the injured king. Upon learning of his mistake, Perceval vows to find the Grail castle again and fulfill his quest. The story breaks off soon after, to be continued in a number of different ways by various authors, such as in Perlesvaus and Sir Perceval of Galles. In later accounts, the true Grail hero is Galahad, the son of Lancelot, but, though his role in the romances is diminished, Percival remains a major character and is one of only two knights (the other is Bors) who accompany Galahad to the Grail castle and complete the quest with him. In early versions, Perceval's sweetheart is Blanchefleur and he becomes the King of Carbonek after healing the Fisher King. In later versions, he is a virgin who dies after achieving the Grail. In Wolfram's version, Perceval's son is Lohengrin, the Knight of the Swan. In modern times His story has been featured in many modern works, including Wagner's influential and controversial 1882 opera Parsifal. *Richard Monaco's 1977 book Parsival: Or, a Knight's Tale is a re-telling of the Percival legend.Fries, Maureen, and Thompson, Raymond H.

Part of achieving the Grail is the bestowal of immense longevity upon Peredur and his wife, Fleur, along with certain other members of the order being granted longer lifespans. He is still alive and even appears young by 1996, when his organisation comes into conflict with the re-awakened Arthur and the other characters of the Gargoyles story.Gargoyles: Clan-Building ‚Äì Vol 2, #7 ‚Äì \\"The Rock\\" ‚Äì *He is the protagonist of the 2000 book Parzival: The Quest of the Grail Knight by Katherine Patterson, based on Wolfram's Parzival. *The 2003 novel Clothar the Frank by Jack Whyte portrays Perceval as an ally of Lancelot in his travels to Camelot. *He appears in the French comedy TV series Kaamelott as a main character, portrayed as a clueless yet loyal knight of the Round Table. *In the BBC television series Merlin, Percival is a large, strong commoner. After helping to free Camelot from the occupation of Morgana, Morgause, and their immortal army (which is supplied by a grail-like goblet called the Cup of Life), he is knighted along with Lancelot, Elyan and Gwaine, against the common practice that knights are only of noble birth. He is also one of the few Round Table knights to survive Arthur's death. *In Philip Reeve's Here Lies Arthur, he appears as Peredur, son of Peredur Long-knife, who is raised as a woman by his mother, who had already lost many sons and her husband to war.

Biography  After training as a nephrologist, he entered private practice and in military with the Puerto Rico National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve in Fort Meade Maryland. He was sent to active duty during the Gulf War and assigned to Walter Reed Army Medical Center. In 1967, he became politically active, participating in the pro-statehood campaign leading to the July 27 political status plebiscite, as a leader of Estadistas Unidos (Statehooders United), a non-partisan group founded by long-time Statehood Republican Party gubernatorial candidate Luis A. Ferr√©. On August 20, 1967, at the assembly in Carolina, Puerto Rico at which the organization was dissolved, Padilla and other party leaders proposed the creation of a new political party that would eventually be known as the New Progressive Party (NPP) or Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP) in Spanish. In January, 1969, after the NPP's electoral triumph and his own election as a state representative, in spite of being a freshman, he was selected as House Majority Leader for the 1969-1973 term. After the NPP's defeat in 1972 and his own reelection, he served as Minority Whip until 1977. In 1976, he won the NPP nomination for mayor of San Juan after a three-way competition with attorney Baltasar Corrada del R√≠o and Senator Sila Nazario, and was elected to the post in November of that year, succeeding newly elected Governor Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ and Carlos S. Quir√≥s who served a days-long stint as mayor following Romero's swearing-in as governor and the official beginning of the 1977-1981 term. His term as mayor was marked by a major expansion of sports and community facilities and the first attempt to wrestle with San Juan's looming solid waste crisis. He also served as President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, been the first Hispanic in that position. Hernan Padilla built the San Juan's Municipal Tower in Hato Rey, the San Juan's Central Park, the Pedrin Zorilla Coliseum, Paseo de Diego, and others installations. He also created San Juan's Municipal police department. Reelected as mayor in 1980, Padilla became increasingly dissatisfied with Romero and the incumbent governor's capacity to lead the party to another victory in 1984 after barely winning reelection by a less than one-half of one percent margin in 1980. The tensions between both leaders led to Padilla splitting from the NPP and creating the Puerto Rican Renewal Party (PRP), and aspiring for governor under the PRP banner. Pro-statehood votes in 1984 were split between the PRP and the NPP, which renominated Romero, and the Popular Democratic Party was returned to power through the election to an unprecedented non-consecutive second term of Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n as governor. After 1984, he returned to medical practice as a nephrologist, serving at the National Capital Area for Kaiser Permanente. In 1991 he was the subject of one television advertisement by Kaiser that was regularly aired across the United States. Padilla channelled his post-1984 political energies through national initiatives, serving as chairman for the US Council for Puerto Rico Statehood (USCPRS). He has rejoined the NPP and was the surprise keynote speaker at the party's August 2010 convention in R√≠o Grande, Puerto Rico, at the invitation of party president, Gov. Luis Fortu√±o, who considers Padilla one of his mentors. Padilla now lives in Miramar, Florida. He is a member of Fraternidad Fi Sigma Alfa. In 2009, he was appointed to represent the Puerto Rico House of Representatives on the five- member board of directors of the Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnerships Authority that regulates public-private partnerships in Puerto Rico. Dr. Padilla writes a weekly column in the largest circulation newspaper in Puerto Rico, El Nuevo Dia, about current political, ideological, economic and administrative issues in Puerto Rico.

It depicts the decline of the family's upper-middle-class, suburban lifestyle as the specter of World War II and Allied Occupation hangs over the novel.

At the time of their father's prime, they were one of the wealthiest families in the region, but over the last generation their fortunes have fallen into decline. The main branch lives in Osaka, at the family home, and consists of the eldest sister, Tsuruko, her husband, Tatsuo, who has taken the Makioka name, and their six children. The branch house is located in Ashiya, an affluent suburb between Osaka and Kobe, and consists of the second-oldest sister, Sachiko, her husband, Teinosuke (also an adopted Makioka), and their young daughter, Etsuko. Tsuruko and Sachiko have two younger sisters, Yukiko and Taeko, who are unmarried and move between the main house and the branch house. As the novel opens, the Makiokas' pride has led them to dismiss the numerous marriage proposals they have received for Yukiko in the past, but, now that their fortunes have declined, the rate of proposals has slowed, and Yukiko, now thirty, remains without a husband. To make matters worse, her name was mistakenly printed in place of Taeko's in a local newspaper story: Taeko had run away with Okubata. Tatsuo demanded a retraction, but instead, the newspaper ran a correction, replacing Yukiko's name with Taeko's. The article embarrassed the Makioka family and stained both Yukiko's and Taeko's names; unhappy with the way Tatsuo handled the affair and generally dissatisfied with his cautious nature, Yukiko and Taeko have begun spending most of their time at the Ashiya house. In the wake of the newspaper incident, Taeko finds refuge in doll making‚Äîshe is quite skilled, and her dolls are sold in department stores. She convinces Sachiko to find her a studio, where she spends a great deal of time working on her dolls. Itani brings Sachiko a marriage prospect, a man named Segoshi. Hurried by Itani, the family agrees to an informal before they can thoroughly check Segoshi's background. The Makiokas become optimistic about their chances of making the match, but are eventually forced to decline when they discover that Segoshi's mother is afflicted with a kind of dementia which was considered hereditary. A few months later, Sachiko receives word of another marriage prospect, this time from an old classmate, Mrs. Jimba. The prospective groom is a middle-aged widower named Nomura. Sachiko is not particularly excited about him, because of his aged appearance, but decides to have him investigated all the same. She asks Mrs. Jimba to give them one or two months to make a decision. In the meantime, the bank Tatsuo works for has decided to send him to Tokyo to manage a branch office. He and his family will move to Tokyo, and it is decided that Yukiko and Taeko should go with them. Taeko is allowed to stay in Ashiya for a short while to tend to her business, but Yukiko is to leave immediately. Yukiko is unhappy in Tokyo, and Tsuruko suggests they send her back to Osaka for a while. A follow-up letter regarding Nomura arrives from Mrs. Jimba, just as Sachiko is searching for an excuse to send for Yukiko. Though not enthusiastic about the match, the Makiokas agree to a miai as a pretense for bringing Yukiko back to Ashiya. Shortly before the miai, Sachiko has a miscarriage, and the Makiokas are forced to postpone meeting Nomura. When Sachiko, Teinosuke, and Yukiko finally meet him, a week later, Sachiko is surprised at how old he looks. After dinner, they are taken back to Nomura's house, where he shows them the Buddhist altar where he prays for his dead wife and children. Yukiko, put off by his insensitivity, declares that she cannot marry him. The family refuses Nomura's marriage proposal, and Yukiko is sent back to Tokyo. ;Book Two Taeko's interest in dolls wanes and she begins to devote time to Western-style sewing and traditional Osaka dance. A dance recital is held at the Ashiya house with Taeko as one of the performers. A personable young photographer named Itakura takes pictures at the request of Okubata. Itakura and Taeko are already acquainted; he photographs her dolls. A month later, a disastrous flood strikes the Kansai region. Taeko is attending a sewing school in the area hardest hit. Itakura rescues her. Impressed by his heroism, Taeko begins to fall for him. Eventually Taeko's and Itakura's relationship becomes known to Sachiko, who disapproves because of Itakura's low social standing. Nevertheless, Taeko is determined to marry him. Taeko wants to study fashion design in France with her sewing teacher and asks Sachiko to convince the main house to support her. When Taeko's sewing teacher abandons her plans to go to France, Taeko decides to open a Western-style dress shop. She goes to Tokyo to ask the main house for money, but is immediately called back to Osaka because Itakura has fallen ill. Itakura is hospitalized for an inner-ear infection and dies of gangrene resulting from complications of surgery. Itakura's death alleviates Sachiko's concern that Taeko will marry below their class. ;Book Three In June, Tatsuo's eldest sister alerts Sachiko of a marriage prospect, a Mr. Sawazaki from a prominent Nagoya family. Sachiko, Yukiko, Taeko, and Etsuko visit Tatsuo's sister in ≈ågaki so that Yukiko can attend the miai. The miai does not go well: Sachiko is left with a negative impression, and Sawazaki rejects the marriage. This is the first time the Makiokas have been refused by a marriage prospect. Upon her return, Sachiko hears that Taeko has taken up again with Okubata. As the relationship grows increasingly open, Teinosuke informs Tsuruko. Tsuruko demands that Taeko be sent to Tokyo; Taeko refuses and is disinherited. Later, Itani presents another marriage prospect for Yukiko. The potential suitor, Hashidera, is an attractive candidate, but he is uncertain if he wants to remarry. Teinosuke takes Yukiko to meet him and goes to great lengths to see the match through, but Yukiko's shyness causes Hashidera to call off the negotiations. Just after this, Sachiko is informed that Taeko has fallen severely ill at Okubata's house. At first, it is assumed that she has dysentery, but the diagnosis is later changed to anthrax. Taeko's condition grows progressively worse, and the sisters are torn between finding better care and allowing Taeko to be seen at Okubata's house. Eventually she is moved to the hospital of a family friend, where she slowly recovers. Meanwhile, Sachiko is told that Taeko has been living off of Okubata since being disinherited. Sachiko also hears that Taeko may be involved with a bar tender named Miyoshi. Sachiko is aghast, but now sees a marriage between Taeko and Okubata as a necessity. After Taeko has recovered, Sachiko learns that Okubata is being pressured by his family to go to Manchuria; Sachiko and Yukiko think that Taeko should go with him. Taeko objects, but Yukiko pushes her, saying that she is indebted to Okubata for everything he has given her. Taeko leaves the house in tears and stays away for two days. Okubata eventually decides against going to Manchuria. The Makiokas also learn that Itani is planning to sell her shop and travel to America, but before her departure, Itani informs Sachiko that she has another suitor for Yukiko. His name is Mimaki, an illegitimate son of a viscount. The sisters travel to Tokyo to meet him, and he quickly charms them. While in Tokyo, Taeko tells Sachiko that she is four months pregnant with Miyoshi's child. Sachiko and Teinosuke arrange for Taeko to have the baby secretly at Arima. To protect the Makiokas‚Äô reputation, Teinosuke asks Okubata to remain silent about Taeko's behavior. Okubata agrees, on condition that Teinosuke compensate him for the money he has spent on Taeko. Teinosuke agrees to pay him two-thousand yen. Taeko's baby dies at birth, and Taeko moves in with Miyoshi. The Makiokas are pressed to answer Mimaki's marriage proposal. Yukiko accepts, whereupon Teinosuke sends a letter to the main house asking for their consent. The wedding date and location are set, and a house is secured for the new couple. Yukiko is not excited when her wedding kimonos arrive and suffers from diarrhea, which persists on the train ride to Tokyo. Author Tanizaki Jun‚Äôichir≈ç was born in Tokyo in 1886 and died in 1965. After the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake and fire, which destroyed Tokyo, Tanizaki settled permanently in Kansai. Many of the characters and events in The Makioka Sisters are loosely based on real people and events: Sachiko is modeled after Tanizaki's third wife, Matsuko, and Sachiko's sisters correspond to Matsuko's. Sachiko's husband, Teinosuke, does not resemble Tanizaki, however. Historical context The Makioka Sisters spans the period from autumn 1936 to April 1941 ending about seven months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The novel references a number of contemporary events, such as the Kobe flood of 1938, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the growing tensions in Europe. Publication began in 1943, at the height of World War II. The popularity of the novel attracted the attention of government censors, who ordered that publication be halted, saying: ‚ÄúThe novel goes on and on detailing the very thing we are most supposed to be on our guard against during this period of wartime emergency: the soft, effeminate, and grossly individualistic lives of women.‚ÄùRubin, 264 Themes Decline and decay are prominent themes of The Makioka Sisters and are emphasized by the repetition of certain events. The succession of Yukiko's suitors, the Makiokas‚Äô yearly cherry-viewing excursions, and the increasing severity of illness in the novel form a pattern of ‚Äúdecline-in-repetition‚Äù.Chambers, The Secret Window, 81 In reaction to this decline, the characters long for an idealized past‚Äîthey attempt to remain connected to their past through yearly rituals and observances.Noguchi, 18 The Makiokas‚Äô adherence to these rituals connects them to the traditions of the merchant class from the Edo period and reflects Tanizaki's belief that the Edo-period culture had been preserved in Osaka.Ito, 195 Throughout, the novel contrasts the Kansai and Kant≈ç regions. \\"Tokyo's poverty, bleakness, and disorder serve to set off Ashiya's harmonious integration of tradition, modernity, and cosmopolitanism\\".It≈ç, 204 By extolling the virtues of the Kansai region in contrast to Tokyo, Tanizaki may have been making a political statement.Chambers, A Tanizaki Feast, 133‚Äì138. The unfavorable comparison of Tokyo to Kansai \\"in the context of the war years, [is] a subversive reminder of the nonmilitary roots of Japanese culture and a sort of 'secret history' of Japan from 1936 to 1941\\".Chambers, A Tanizaki Feast, 137. Publication Sasameyuki began as a serial in the magazine Ch≈´≈ç K≈çron in 1943, but publication was halted by the Information Bureau of the Japanese War Ministry after two installments, the first in the issue for New Year 1943 (now Book 1, Chapters 1 to 8) the second in the issue for March 1943 (now Book 1, Chapters 9 to 13). In 1944, Tanizaki published 248 copies of a privately printed edition of Book One, with financial backing from Ch≈´≈ç K≈çron; this was, again, censured by the military. After the conclusion of World War II, the novel was published in three parts: Book 1 in 1946, Book 2 in 1947, and Book 3 in 1948 Chambers, The Secret Window, 71. Reception and legacy The novel has been called ‚Äúthe greatest cosmopolitan novel since the Meiji Restoration‚Äù.Nakamura, 58, trans. Anthony H. Chambers Following its success, Tanizaki was awarded the Mainichi Prize for Publication and Culture and the Asahi Culture Prize . Translations Sasameyuki has been translated into at least 14 languages. The English translation, by Edward G.

It states that if a (v, b, r, k, Œª)-design exists with v = b (a symmetric block design), then: * if v is even, then k ‚àí Œª is a square; * if v is odd, then the following Diophantine equation has a nontrivial solution: *: x2 ‚àí (k ‚àí Œª)y2 ‚àí (‚àí1)(v‚àí1)/2 Œª z2 = 0. The theorem was proved in the case of projective planes in . It was extended to symmetric designs in .  Projective planes  In the special case of a symmetric design with Œª = 1, that is, a projective plane, the theorem (which in this case is referred to as the Bruck‚ÄìRyser theorem) can be stated as follows: If a finite projective plane of order q exists and q is congruent to 1 or 2 (mod 4), then q must be the sum of two squares. Note that for a projective plane, the design parameters are v = b = q2 \\\\+ q + 1, r = k = q + 1, Œª = 1. Thus, v is always odd in this case. The theorem, for example, rules out the existence of projective planes of orders 6 and 14 but allows the existence of planes of orders 10 and 12. Since a projective plane of order 10 has been shown not to exist using a combination of coding theory and large- scale computer search, the condition of the theorem is evidently not sufficient for the existence of a design. However, no stronger general non- existence criterion is known.  Connection with incidence matrices  The existence of a symmetric (v, b, r, k, Œª)-design is equivalent to the existence of a v √ó v incidence matrix R with elements 0 and 1 satisfying : where is the v √ó v identity matrix and J is the v √ó v all-1 matrix. In essence, the Bruck‚ÄìRyser‚ÄìChowla theorem is a statement of the necessary conditions for the existence of a rational v √ó v matrix R satisfying this equation. In fact, the conditions stated in the Bruck‚ÄìRyser‚ÄìChowla theorem are not merely necessary, but also sufficient for the existence of such a rational matrix R. They can be derived from the Hasse‚ÄìMinkowski theorem on the rational equivalence of quadratic forms. References  * van Lint, J.H., and R.M. Wilson (1992), A Course in Combinatorics.

Design and development Conceived as a rival to the Grunau Baby, it was the first product of the newly formed Sportflugzeugbau G√∂ppingen Martin Schempp firm. It was a conventional, strut-braced high-wing design of wooden construction, incorporating a wheel aft of the loaded centre of gravity to ease ground handling, as well as aero-tow and winch launches. Of very similar construction to the Grunau Baby, the Wolf had strut-braced high-set monoplane wings supported on a pylon aft of the cockpit. The hexagonal-section fuselage was constructed largely of wood with plywood skinning and the wings and tail surfaces were plywood-skinned back to the main spars with wooden-framed fabric-covered rear portions. The undercarriage consisted of rubber-sprung skids under the nose and tail with a fixed mainwheel aft of the loaded centre of gravity. Operational history Stressed for aerobatics, one example was purchased by Alan Cobham's National Aviation Day displays, and was flown under tow directly to London by Joan Meakin. During early flying with the Wolf it gained a reputation for dangerous spinning characteristics, which resulted in the G√∂ 1 being grounded in 1938, pending incorporation of modified, longer- chord, slotted ailerons. The cost of the required modifications proved uneconomic for the majority of owners and the majority of G√∂ 1s never flew again and only three are known to have survived in museums. One is still operational in Germany at Schempp-Hirth GmbH. On June 30, 2018, Tilo Holighaus made a 74 km cross country flight with it.https://www.onlinecontest.org/olc-3.0/gliding/flightinfo.html?dsId=6584264 Variants ;TG-20: Four G√∂ 1s impressed by the USAAF and allocated serials 42-57168,42-57175, 42-57195, and 42-57204https://usmilitaryaircraft.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/airf-tg.pdf Specifications (G√∂ 1 Wolf) G√∂ppingen G√∂ 1 Wolf 3-view drawing from L'Aerophile March 1937 See alsoReferencesFurther reading * *Japanese Gliders 1930‚Äì1945, Âõû„ÇµŒ¥,„Éº‰πãi 1930‚Äì1945, KAWAKAMI, H.

Plot The story takes place in Japan primarily during the late 1930s (Sh≈çwa period). The sisters live in the Kansai area (Kobe/Osaka) and travel to Tokyo and other prefectures throughout the novel. Cast * Keiko Kishi - Tsuruko Makioka: The eldest Makioka sister is described as being phlegmatic, and most of her voice throughout the novel is heard through letters she sends to her sisters. Tsuruko lives in the \\"main\\" Makioka house in Osaka, and is not only removed physically from her sisters, who live in a branch house in Ashiya, but also seems to be removed emotionally. * Yoshiko Sakuma - Sachiko Makioka: The second eldest Makioka sister who is the mistress of the branch house in Ashiya. Sachiko is good- tempered and indulgent of her younger sisters, who live with her instead of, as tradition would have it, with Tsuruko. * Sayuri Yoshinaga - Yukiko Makioka: Melancholy Yukiko is still unmarried at 30, because, when the Makioka family was in its heyday, all of her marriage proposals were turned down as not being good enough. Now, with the family in decline, marriage opportunities are much more scarce, and Yukiko's stoicity and shyness do nothing to incite her suitors' attentions. So shy that she cannot even speak on the telephone, Yukiko is sometimes frustrating, but ultimately loved by her sisters. * Yuko Kotegawa - Taeko Makioka: The youngest Makioka sister embraces both Western clothing style and Western attitudes toward the world more than any of her sisters. Taeko smokes, has affairs and willfully defies the orders of the main Osaka house. This is mostly because she is impatient waiting for Yukiko to marry, which she must do before Taeko is allowed. Taeko is called \\"Koi san\\" endearingly, by her two older sisters in Ashiya. Calling the youngest sister \\"Koi san\\" is something commonly practiced in Osaka. * Juzo Itami - Tatsuo Makioka: Tsuruko's husband, who took the Makioka name when he married her, and is now the master of the Makiokas. The three Ashiya sisters find Tatsuo abrasive, and somewhat dull. Tatsuo is employed at a bank. * Koji Ishizaka - Teinosuke Makioka: Sachiko's husband who also took on the Makioka name. Teinosuke is kind, respectful of the sisters and brilliantly smart, especially when it comes to literary arts, such as poetry and letter-writing. Teinosuke is an accountant. * Kobeicho Katsura - Okubata: Also called \\"Kei-boy\\" by the Ashiya sisters, is one of Taeko's suitors with whom she tried, and failed, to elope ten years before the story's beginning. * Itokku Kishibe - Itakura: A photographer friend of Taeko's, a stranger to the Makioka family, to whom Taeko is attracted. * Mika Wakabayashi - Etsuko: Sachiko's school-aged daughter, who is especially fond of Yukiko. * Yukari Uehara - O-Haru: A maid at the Ashiya house. Sachiko took O-Haru under her wing and tries to teach the gossipy maid manners and decorum. * Michiyo Yokoyama - Mrs. Itani: The owner of a beauty salon that the three younger sisters frequent. Mrs. Itani's gossip and love of matchmaking often help the sisters find prospects for a husband for Yukiko. Reception In February 1985, Vincent Canby called it a \\"a lovely though not always easy to follow adaptation\\" of the novel and said \\"I can't be sure that the English subtitles catch what I assume to be the satiric edge to the dialogue in what is a rather sad comedy of manners. What is clear, though, is Mr. Ichikawa's cinematic equivalent of a literary style, in which characters are sometimes isolated in extended close-ups that have the effect-- if not the substance--of internal monologues or of author's comments. The Makioka Sisters, though always beautiful to look at, is more stately than emotionally or intellectually involving.\\" When it was screened as part of a TIFF 2013 retrospective, Scott A. Gray of Exclaim! gave the film (6 stars out of 10), saying: \\"Overall, it's a beautiful, well-acted work packed with gorgeous art design, but one that falls prey to the occasional indulgence-- bloated scenes, garish synthesizer music--that detracts from the film's impact\\".

Richard du Pont and Chet Decker flew Minimoas to win the US Championships in 1937 and 1938. It was made out of wood and fabric with cantilevered 'gull' wings. A B-version in 1938 had thinner wings with a modified section and the gull's kink in a different place. The undercarriage was non-retractable. It was the first glider built to carry water-ballast in a tank behind the pilot.

It was later re-edited into a single feature for DVD release by TLA Releasing. It depicts the interactions of a racially and sexually diverse group of friends and family living in Notting Hill.Philly.com The series was written and created by Rikki Beadle- Blair, who also stars as one of the show's central characters.Indiewire The cast also includes Noel Clarke, Paul Keating, Mat Fraser, Karl Collins, Pui Fan Lee and Preeya Kalidas. The show features extravagant and colourful costumes and scenery, varied shooting styles and quick pacing. Much of the music was written and performed by Beadle Blair, who intended the series to feel like a musical. The show was hailed by critics for its diversity; it depicted a social setting relatively free of racism or homophobia. It was also noted for its inclusion of Fraser, a thalidomide survivor with phocomelic arms, in a role where his disability was simply part of the show's fabric rather than an inherent focus of his character's role. Plot outline The story is set over the course of two consecutive weekends in spring, and follows Kwame (Clarke), seventeen and straight, who is trying to reconcile his estranged fathers, Max (Beadle Blair) and Jordan (Collins). He must contend with Max's insistence that he is over Jordan, and Jordan's new relationship with former military man Jonno. Kwame is also trying to attract his love interest, Asha, and provide support to his two best friends: Dean (Keating), a talented footballer struggling with an abusive father and a crush on Max, and skater boy Bambi, trying unsuccessfully to secure a commitment from his older, on-off boyfriend, Robin. Max's married friends Geri and Daniel descend into a bitter separation after Geri feels Daniel takes her for granted; she is later romanced by Asha's father, Tel. Asha's best friend Jay (Lee) embarks on a new relationship with the enigmatic Flora, despite her own commitment issues. Former drug addicts Peggy and Pablo struggle to adapt to a life of sobriety together - especially when Peggy gets back in touch with their dealer, Dean's brother Marlon (Fraser). Max's sister Cindy finds her relationship with her partner Doris threatened by the reappearance of her first boyfriend, Gabriel. Kwame's unstable birth mother, Hilly, deals with the death of her cat and reconnects with her estranged parents.

He was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec and represented the Quebec City electoral district of Vanier. He was appointed to Premier Jean Charest's Cabinet on April 29, 2003 and served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General. Bellemare pushed for harsher sentences for organized crime. He was criticized several times by Justice Fraser Martin for the way he handled a juvenile prostitution case which took place in Quebec City and involved talk show host Robert Gillet.Le juge Martin critique √† nouveau le procureur g√©n√©ral Marc Bellemare, Le Journal de Montr√©al, February 6, 2004 For several years, Bellemare has been a strong advocate of abolishing Quebec's car insurance law.

The Liberals, who had made the proposed change part of their platform, soon abandoned the idea. Disappointed, Bellemare resigned from his cabinet post on April 27, 2004 and relinquished his seat the next day, lasting less than a year in office.

He also founded a political party, Vision Quebec, which was registered on February 22, 2005. Bellemare ended up finishing a distant third. (See 2005 Quebec municipal elections) An early mayoral election was called in 2007, after the death of incumbent Mayor Andr√©e Boucher. Bellemare ran and finished a distant third again. He resigned as party leader on December 26, 2007. In 2008, Bellemare unsuccessfully petitioned the Papal Nuncio to Canada for an eventual visit of Pope Benedict XVI in Quebec City.

Medieval Lands: A prosopography of medieval European noble and royal families, \\"ROGER de Quincy (-25 Apr 1264, bur [Brackley]\\" hereditary Constable of Scotland, was a nobleman of Anglo-Norman and Scottish descent who was prominent in both England and Scotland, at his death having one of the largest baronial landholdings in the two kingdoms. Early life The de Quincy family, originating from the village of Cuinchy in Artois, had been prominent in England and Scotland from about 1130. Roger, second son and eventual heir of Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester, and his wife Margaret, younger daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester, probably joined his father on the Fifth Crusade, during which the elder de Quincy fell sick in Egypt and died. Since Roger's older brother Robert had died a few years earlier, he inherited his father's estates on his return, but was not recognised as earl until his mother died in 1235. Career He married a major heiress, Helen of Galloway, the eldest of the three daughters of Alan, Lord of Galloway. On her father's death in 1234, he acquired her share of the paternal inheritance, which consisted of the hereditary office of Constable of Scotland and one-third of the lordship of Galloway. The title of Lord of Galloway, however, went through Helen's half-sister Devorguilla to her husband John Balliol.Stewart, John, LL.D., and Burnett, George, Lord Lyon, editors, \\"The Exchequer Rolls of Scotland\\", vol.1, 1264-1359, Edinburgh, 1878, pps:33 and 45. In 1235 the Galwegians rebelled under Gille Ruadh, not wanting their land divided, but the rebellion was suppressed by King Alexander II of Scotland. The Galwegians revolted again in 1246, following the death without children of Helen's sister Christina, first wife of William de Forz, 4th Earl of Aumale. Further unrest in 1247, possibly due to his strict rule, found de Quincy trapped in a castle, from which he escaped to obtain help from King Alexander in suppressing the rebellion. Although actively managing his lands in Scotland, despite being Constable after this time he seems to have had little further involvement in Scotland's politics and wars. In England he also steered clear of politics initially but was gradually drawn into the baronial opposition to the rule of King Henry III, He joined with other nobles in 1239 and 1246 in written remonstrances to the Pope about papal interference in English affairs. In 1258, he was elected by the barons to the twelve-member commission charged with overseeing the revised constitution of the Provisions of Oxford and was appointed also to the committee to arrange the financial aid promised to Henry. In 1259 he led a delegation to St Omer that forbade the King's brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall from returning to England unless he swore to observe the Provisions of Oxford. After this de Quincy played little part in national affairs. He died aged about 69 on 25 April 1264, eighteen days after the outbreak of civil war, and was buried at Brackley. Having no male heir, the earldom of Winchester became extinct and his estates were divided among the husbands of his three daughters. Family He married three times, leaving three daughters from his first marriage to Helen of Galloway: *Margaret (or Margery), who married William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby; *Elizabeth (or Isabel), who married Alexander Comyn, 2nd Earl of Buchan; *Helen, who married Alan de la Zouche. His second marriage was in about 1250 to Maud de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, who died in 1252. Thirdly, in 1252, he married Eleanor de Ferrers, daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby. Neither of these marriages produced any children. References *Grant G.

It is in the civil parish of Alveley and Romsley. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,098. The Black Death is said to have killed 60% of the village population in 1349. A stone cross, the Buttercross, outside the village dates from the time of the Black Death when it was a place for food to be left for the village when it was quarantined. Churches The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary is 12th-century with a 14th-century south chapel. In the chapel is a very faded 14th-century mural that is thought to represent the Seven Deadly Sins. The upper part of the tower was rebuilt in about 1779. The building was heavily restored in 1878‚Äì79 under the direction of Sir Arthur Blomfield. It is a Grade II* listed building. Alveley has also a Methodist chapel, which was built in 1862. Coal mining and country park From 1937 to 1969 the village had a coal mine in conjunction with the neighbouring village of Highley across the River Severn. The first shaft at Alveley Colliery was sunk in 1935. Production began in 1938 and reached full output in 1944. Coal was transferred to sidings on the Severn Valley Railway on the opposite bank of the river, to be taken away by rail. Declining coal quality at a time of national over-supply led to the colliery closing in January 1969 leaving high unemployment and a ravaged landscape. An industrial estate was built after the mine closure along with a landscape reclamation scheme in 1986 and the disused colliery and spoil tips were converted into the Severn Valley Country Park. The landscape includes meadows, woods, ponds and wetlands with waymarked trails of short and longer lengths to encourage locals and visitors to explore the village's heritage fully. Every year a Miner's Memories Day is held at the Country Park Visitor Centre which permanently houses mine memorabilia and has a caf√© and indoor viewpoint over the valley. The display includes miners' picks, spikes, crowbars, breathing equipment used in mine rescue, photos (many donated by local residents), and a certificate awarded to a local Alveley miner on achieving \\"56 years service to the mine and his country\\". In 2006 a new footbridge linking Alveley and Highley was opened in the Country Park. This replaced a 1930s bridge that had become unsafe. The bridge provides access from Alveley to the Country Park Halt on the Severn Valley Railway, which is on the Highley side of the river on the site of the former coal washing plant and colliery sidings. The riverbank is popular with anglers, along with a number of local private pools. In 2017, the community led Alveley Mining Heritage Group was formed to preserve and present memories of mining in the village for the benefit of future generations. The Squirrel public house Village Alveley has several historic pubs including the Three Horseshoes, parts of which may be 17th-century. The others are The Squirrel and The Royal Oak. There is also the Mill HotelMill Hotel and a working men's club. The village has a primary school, small supermarket and newsagent and a few other small shops and eateries. Cricket club Alveley Cricket ClubAlveley Cricket Club was founded in 1908 and played at Coton Hall on the outskirts of the village, at the former home of general Robert E. Lee's ancestors. After the Second World War it moved to play on the Recreation Ground in the centre of Alveley. The club has invested heavily in its facilities. Its pavilion was built in 1981 and extended in 2007. The club has a potential player base of 100 people who regularly play for the club. The club has always had a strong commitment to youth cricket and the continued growth in its junior section. Off the field the club has an active social calendar and regularly hold family social events. Events include a six-a-side competition, barbecues, charity events and screening live sport in the Pavilion. Until the mid-1970s friendly cricket was played before joining the Kidderminster League in 1989. The club now plays in the Worcestershire County League (Saturday) with friendlies played on a Sunday. As well as the two Saturday sides we run a midweek team who play in the Kidderminster League, the club also runs a successful junior section for children aged between 4 and 17 years. Countryside A small hamlet to the southwest of the village, Little London, is one of more than 25 settlements which share the capital city's name. The parish contains two other manors, besides the manor of Alveley, Kingsnordley and Astley. Alan James Nicholls documented the Alveley parish in The History of Alveley, published 1994, .

Development  The '140' was a reconnaissance/bomber aircraft, derived from the OKB-1 EF 131 with Soviet turbojet engines. The initial version, a tactical jet bomber with a secondary reconnaissance role, was initiated as the EF-140 by Dr. Brunolf Baade, at OKB-1, in 1947. The six Jumo 004 engines of the EF-131 were replaced by two Mikulin AM-TKRD-01 axial flow turbojets, rated at 32.372 kN (7,280 lb) thrust, in large nacelles attached to the underside of the wing at the same position. Using the airframe of the second EF-131 prototype, the '140' was very similar in appearance, and to its forebear Junkers Ju 287, with the classic Junkers-style crew compartment in the nose, wings swept forward 19¬∞50' with marked dihedral, and the underslung engine nacelles extending forward of the leading-edge. Construction was of aluminium alloy stressed skin, with a semi-monocoque fuselage, wings with multiple spars covered with stressed skin panels, and high strength steel for highly stressed parts. Defensive armament consisted of VDB-6 dorsal and NDB-1M ventral remotely controlled turrets controlled by the gunner, in the rear of the crew compartment, using upper and lower periscopes. The prototype was completed quickly and ready for flight tests by late September 1948 after being disassembled and transported to Tyoply Stan airfield on the outskirts of Moscow. The first flight took place on 30 September 1948, but early test flights were disrupted by severe problems with the fuel control units of the AM-TKRD-01 engines. A replacement set was fitted and testing continued until the manufacturer's tests were completed on 24 May 1949. Council of Ministers directive No. 1886-696 called for development of 140 as a tactical reconnaissance aircraft powered by two Klimov VK-1 centrifugal flow turbo-jets. During the design work for the '140-R' the deficiencies highlighted by flight testing of the '140' were addressed as well as the addition of wingtip-mounted fuel tanks and new nacelles for the VK-1 engines, and the fitting of DT-V1 and DT-N1 turrets, replacing those of the '140', armed with 2 √ó 23mm cannon each. Flight testing of '140-R' commenced on 20 October at a specially built airfield near the GOZ-1 factory at Borki, (the German workers were not admitted to Tyoplyy Stan for security reasons), where four flights were carried out, all of which suffered from severe vibration of the wings. The final variant of '140' was the '140-B/R', which was a reconnaissance bomber, powered by the same engines but with increased weight and reduced performance. Design work, static tests and construction were complete and ground testing of the aircraft partially completed when all work on '140-R' and '140-B/R' aircraft was terminated by the Council of Ministers' directive No. 2474-974 issued on 18 June 1950.

They are collared and buttoned dress shirts, usually short-sleeved and cut from printed fabric. They are often worn untucked, but can be worn tucked in as well. They are not only casual wear, but serve as informal business attire in Hawaii. \\"Aloha Friday\\", a now-common tradition of celebrating the end of the workweek by wearing more casual attire on Fridays, initially grew out of an effort to promote Aloha shirts.  Design  Aloha dress shirts are printed, mostly short-sleeved, and collared. They almost always have buttons, sometimes for the entire length of the shirt or at least down to the chest. They usually have a left chest pocket sewn in, often with attention to ensure the printed pattern remains continuous. Aloha shirts may be worn by men or women. Women's aloha shirts usually have a lower-cut, v-neck style. The lower hems are straight, and the shirts are often worn with the shirt-tails hanging out, rather than tucked in. Wearing an untucked shirt was possibly influenced by the local Filipinos who wore shirt-tail out, and called these meaning \\"friend\\". Wearing it untucked or tucked depends on personal taste; it carries the same connotations of tucking or unlocking a polo shirt. In the 1950s, the shirt became allowed as business attire for aloha week, but only if worn tucked in. Traditional men's aloha shirts are usually adorned with traditional Hawaiian quilt designs, tapa designs, and simple floral patterns in more muted colors. Contemporary aloha shirts may have prints that do not feature any traditional Hawaiian quilt or floral designs but instead may incorporate drinks, palm trees, surf boards or other island tropical elements in a similar form as the traditional aloha shirt. It has been observed that locals (kama ªƒÅina) tended to shy away from the garishness of Aloha shirts as \\"too wild\\" when they first appeared, whereas tourists embraced wearing designs of many bright colors. An example of the type of shirt the locals may prefer includes the \\"reverse print\\"; these shirts are often printed on the interior, resulting in the muted color on the exterior.  History  Quilt made from vintage aloha shirt fabric, circa 1960s According to some sources, the origin of Aloha shirts can be traced to the 1920s or the early 1930s, when the Honolulu-based dry goods store \\"Musa-Shiya the Shirtmaker\\" under the proprietorship of K≈çichir≈ç Miyamoto, started making shirts out of colorful Japanese prints. apud It has also been contended that the Aloha shirt was devised in the early 1930s by Chinese merchant Ellery Chun of \\"King-Smith Clothiers and Dry Goods\\", a store in Waikiki. Although this claim has been described as a myth reinforced by repeated telling, Chun may have been the first to mass-produce or to maintain the ready-to-wear in stock to be sold off the shelf. The name \\"Aloha shirt\\" appeared later. By 1935 and 1936, the word \\"Aloha\\" was being attached to various sorts of Hawaiian products, so calling the garments \\"Aloha shirts\\" was hardly original. The term Aloha shirt first appeared in print in an advertisement for Musa-Shiya in the June 28, 1935 issue of The Honolulu Advertiser newspaper. However, Ellery Chun is sometimes credited for coining the term, perhaps in 1933; Chun's store reportedly carried window signs that said \\"Aloha shirts\\". The term \\"Aloha sportswear\\" was registered as a trademark by Chun's company in 1936, followed by Chun trademarking \\"Aloha Shirt\\" in 1937 and owning the rights to this appellation for the next 20 years. Tori Richard aloha shirts in a store Within years, major designer labels sprang up all over Hawaii and began manufacturing and selling Aloha shirts en masse. By the end of the 1930s, 450 people were employed in an industry worth $600,000 annually. Two notable manufacturers of this period are Kamehameha and Branfleet (later Kahala), both founded in 1936. Retail chains in Hawaii, including mainland based ones, may mass-produce a single aloha shirt design for employee uniforms. After World War II, many servicemen and servicewomen returned to the United States from Asia and the Pacific islands with aloha shirts made in Hawaii since the 1930s. One significant manufacturer was Shaheen, which began business in 1948. Following Hawaii's statehood in 1959, when extant tropical prints came to be regarded as rather tacky, designer Alfred Shaheen became noted for producing aloha shirts of higher chic and quality, and Elvis Presley wore a Shaheen-designed red aloha on the album cover for Blue Hawaii (1961). In 1956, Tori Richard, a well-known brand of Alohas was established. Reyn Spooner (or, rather, its precursor, Spooner's of Waikiki) also established business in 1956.  Exports  Garments manufactured in Hawaii could bear \\"Made in Hawaii\\" labels before statehood (1959), and even afterwards, their sales to mainland USA continued to be referred to as \\"exports\\". Aloha shirts tend to be referred to as \\"Hawaiian shirts\\" by the populace from the mainland United States, and are often brilliantly colored with floral patterns or generic Polynesian motifs. The Aloha shirt is currently the premier textile export of the Hawaii manufacturing industry.  Aloha dress codes = Aloha Week  Man with a typical Aloha shirt during the Aloha Festivals Floral Parade 2012 In 1946, the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce funded a study of aloha shirts and designs for comfortable business clothing worn during the hot Hawaiian summers. The City and County of Honolulu passed a resolution allowing their employees to wear sport shirts from June‚ÄìOctober. City employees were not allowed to wear aloha shirts for business until the creation of the Aloha Week festival in 1947. The Aloha Week festival was motivated by both cultural and economic concerns: First held at Ala Moana Park in October, the festival revived interest in ancient Hawaiian music, dancing, sports, and traditions. There was a holoku ball, a floral parade, and a makahiki festival attended by 8,000 people. Economically, the week-long event first attracted visitors during October ‚Äì traditionally a slow month for tourism ‚Äì which benefited the Hawaiian fashion industry as they supplied the muumuu and aloha shirts worn for the celebration. Aloha Week expanded in 1974 to six islands, and was lengthened to a month. In 1991, Aloha Week was renamed to Aloha Festivals. In the end, Aloha Week had a direct influence on the resulting demand for alohawear, and was responsible for supporting local clothing manufacturing: locals needed the clothing for the festivals, and soon people in Hawaii began wearing the clothing in greater numbers on more of a daily basis. Hawaii's fashion industry was relieved, as they were initially worried that popular clothing from the mainland United States would eventually replace aloha attire.  Aloha Friday  In 1962, a professional manufacturing association known as the Hawaiian Fashion Guild began to promote aloha shirts and clothing for use in the workplace, particularly as business attire. In a campaign called \\"Operation Liberation\\", the Guild distributed two aloha shirts to every member of the Hawaii House of Representatives and the Hawaii Senate. Subsequently, a resolution passed in the Senate recommending aloha attire be worn throughout the summer, beginning on Lei Day. The wording of the resolution spoke of letting \\"the male populace return to 'aloha attire' during the summer months for the sake of comfort and in support of the 50th state's garment industry\\". In 1965, Bill Foster, Sr., president of the Hawaii Fashion Guild, led the organization in a campaign lobbying for \\"Aloha Friday\\", a day employers would allow men to wear aloha shirts on the last business day of the week a few months out of the year. Aloha Friday officially began in 1966, and young adults of the 1960s embraced the style, replacing the formal business wear favored by previous generations. By 1970, aloha wear had gained acceptance in Hawaii as business attire for any day of the week. Unlike the court dress required in most jurisdictions, attorneys in Hawaii may be allowed to wear aloha shirts in court, though this varies among individual courts. Hawaii's custom of Aloha Friday slowly spread east to California, continuing around the globe until the 1990s, when it became known as Casual Friday. Today in Hawaii, alohawear is worn as business attire for any day of the week, and \\"Aloha Friday\\" is generally used to refer to the last day of the work week. Now considered Hawaii's term for \\"Thank God It's Friday\\" (TGIF), the phrase was used by Kimo Kahoano and Paul Natto in their 1982 song, \\"It's Aloha Friday, No Work 'til Monday\\", heard every Friday on Hawaii radio stations across the state.  Aloha attire  The related concept of \\"aloha attire\\" stems from the Aloha shirt. Semi-formal functions such as weddings, birthday parties, and dinners are often designated as \\"aloha attire\\", meaning that men wear Aloha shirts and women wear muumuu or other tropical prints. Because Hawaii tends to be more casual, it is rarely appropriate to attend such functions in full evening wear like on the mainland;Dale Hope: The Aloha shirt with a different year of introduction. instead, aloha attire is seen as the happy medium between excessive formality and casual wear (i.e., business casual).

Their loss was a notable blow to the Japanese war effort. On 25 May Grenadier was diverted from her patrol area to Midway Island, where she formed part of the submarine patrol line as the American fleet in a bloody but brilliant battle handed the Imperial Navy its first defeat in some three hundred years. Grenadiers third war patrol was in the Truk area, heavily patrolled by enemy ships and planes. Although she sighted some 28 Japanese ships, enemy planes effectively hampered her, and she returned to her new base, Fremantle, Australia, empty-handed. Deployment to Australia The Malay Barrier was the site of Grenadiers fourth war patrol from 13 October to 10 December. After laying a minefield off Haiphong, Indochina, the submarine made an unsuccessful attack on a large freighter. During the severe depth charging which followed, sea water seeped into the batteries; Grenadiers crew suffered headaches and nausea from chlorine gas poisoning for the remainder of the patrol. On 12 November, she attacked and sank by torpedo the rescue tug () off the coast of Vietnam (11¬∞18'N 109¬∞02'E). To increase the misery, on 20 November Grenadier spotted a -class aircraft carrier, escorted by a cruiser and a destroyer, heading through the Strait of Makassar too distant to shoot. Grenadier surfaced to radio the aircraft carrier's location and course to Fremantle submarine base in hope that another submarine could capitalize on it. Grenadiers fifth war patrol, under the command of LCDR John Allison Fitzgerald, between 1 January and 20 February 1943, brought her considerably better fortune than earlier patrols. A 75-ton schooner fell victim to her deck guns 10 January, and two days later Grenadier sighted a small tanker with a barge in tow. Judging the target not worth a torpedo, she slipped silently into the column behind the two Japanese ships. At dusk she battle surfaced. With binoculars lashed to the deck guns as sights, she raked the tanker and barge, sinking them immediately. The remainder of her patrol, along the Borneo coast through shallow and treacherous waters, was hampered by fathometer failures. She conducted an aggressive attack on two cargo ships 22 January but did not sink them. The submarine departed Australia on 20 March on her last war patrol and headed for the Strait of Malacca, gateway between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Patrolling along the Malay and Thai coasts, Grenadier claimed a small freighter off the island of Phuket on 6 April. She remained in the area and late in the night of 20 April sighted two merchantmen and closed in for the attack. Running on the surface at dawn 21 April, Grenadier spotted, and was simultaneously spotted by, a Japanese plane. The submarine dived, and as it passed her executive officer commented, \\"We ought to be safe now.\\" Just then, explosions rocked Grenadier and heeled her over 15 to 20 degrees. Power and lights failed completely and the fatally wounded ship settled to the bottom at . She tried to make repairs, while a fierce fire blazed in the maneuvering room. After 13 hours of sweating it out on the bottom Grenadier, managed to surface after dark to clear the boat of smoke and inspect damage. The damage to her propulsion system was irreparable. Attempting to bring his ship closer to shore so that the crew could scuttle her and escape into the jungle, Commander Fitzgerald even tried to jury-rig a sail. But the long night's work proved futile. As dawn broke on 22 April, Grenadiers weary crew sighted two Japanese ships heading for them. The skipper \\"didn't think it advisable to make a stationary dive in 280 feet of water without power,\\" and the crew began burning confidential documents prior to abandoning ship. A Japanese plane attacked the stricken submarine, but Grenadier, though dead in the water and to all appearances helpless, blazed away with her machine guns. She hit the plane on its second pass. As the damaged plane veered off, its torpedo landed about from the boat and exploded. Loss Opening all vents, the crew of Grenadier abandoned ship and watched her sink to her final resting place. A Japanese merchantman picked up eight officers and 68 enlisted men and took them to Penang, Malay States, where they were questioned, beaten, and starved before being sent to other prison camps. They were then separated and transferred from camp to camp along the Malay Peninsula and finally to Japan. Throughout the war they suffered brutal, inhuman treatment, and their refusal to reveal military information frustrated and angered their captors. First word that any had survived Grenadier reached Australia on 27 November 1943. Despite the brutal and sadistic treatment, all but four of Grenadiers crew survived their two years in Japanese hands. Grenadier received four battle stars for World War II service.

Barbarous radiates were issued privately primarily during the Crisis of the Third Century (c. 259-274 CE) in the western provinces. They are not generally regarded as forgeries since they were rarely deceptive because they were smaller and cruder than standard issues. They probably functioned as small change. Although earlier numismatists, notably Philip V. Hill, theorized that barbarous radiates were produced long after their prototypes and into the Dark Ages and Saxon period, more recent works argue that they were generally contemporary to their prototypes. According to Hill, in England, although barbarous radiates were clearly produced at several different locations, hoard evidence demonstrate local styles. For example, in northern England there was a greater affinity towards producing barbarous radiates with reverse figures with relief-less outlines, while in southern England bolder, fuller, high relief figures were more common. Similar \\"schools of art\\" exist for pieces produced in continental Europe. Barbarous radiate of Postumus Due to their unofficial manufacture, barbarous radiates exhibit many peculiarities. Reverse types portray a certain deity or personification, for example Spes, might feature a reverse legend instead for Pietas. On some specimens the devices normally associated with one deity or personification is shown with a different deity or personification. For example, the sceptre, which is normally a device of Pax, is instead shown with Pietas. The result is a generic reverse personification or deity. Legends of barbarous radiates range from correct and exact copies of the prototype, to a jumble of unintelligible, meaningless letters and symbols. Smaller pieces known as minims, which are less than 10 mm in diameter, are often anepigraphic. For very degraded barbarous imitations, there is a tendency to emphasize a particular feature of the prototype, in this case the radiate crown. The most frequently imitated prototypes are of the Gallic emperors the Tetrici (270-273), Tetricus I and his son, Tetricus II. The next most frequent are those of Claudius II (270), especially the posthumous issue with the altar reverse, and Victorinus (268-270). Imitations of Postumus antoniniani are scarce, although imitations of his large bronzes (such as the double sestertius) are relatively common. Other uncommon to rare types in order of frequency are Gallienus, Quintillus, Probus, Aurelian, and Tacitus.

It is a heat- resistant and strong synthetic fibre developed in the early 1970s by the Dutch company Akzo Nobel's division Enka BV, later Akzo Industrial Fibers. The research name of the para-aramid fibre was originally Fiber X, but it was soon called Arenka. Although the Dutch para-aramid fiber was developed only a little later than DuPont's Kevlar, introduction of Twaron as a commercial product came much later than Kevlar due to financial problems at the AKZO company in the 1970s. History This is a chronology of the development of Twaron: * In 1960s a research program starts for \\"Fiber X.\\" * In 1972 the ENKA Research laboratory develops a para-aramid called Arenka. * In 1973 Akzo decides to use sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as a solvent for spinning. * In 1974 New process route was found at Akzo Research laboratory, using N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) with a co-solvent (auxiliary solvent) with an ionic component (Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups in order to dissolve the aromatic polymer. * In 1976 a pilot plant is built. * In 1977 first production starts. * In 1984 the product is renamed Twaron. * In 1986 commercial production is started at five locations and nine plants. * In 1987 Twaron is introduced as a commercial product. * In 1989 the aramid business of Akzo becomes an independent Business Unit called Twaron BV. * Since 2000 Twaron BV is owned by the Teijin Group, now called Teijin Twaron BV and based in Arnhem, Netherlands. The main production facilities for Twaron are in Emmen and Delfzijl. * In 2007 Teijin Twaron expands for the fourth time in six years and also changes its name into Teijin Aramid. Production=Polymer preparation Twaron is a p-phenylene terephthalamide (PpPTA), the simplest form of the AABB para polyaramide. PpPTA is a product of p-phenylene diamine (PPD) and terephthaloyl dichloride (TDC). To dissolve the aromatic polymer Twaron used a co-solvent of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and an ionic component (calcium chloride CaCl2) to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups. The invention of this specific process was done in 1974 at AKZO Research Laboratory in Arnhem by a team consisting of Leo Vollbracht, Teun Veerman (assistant of Leo Vollbracht) and Wim Engelhard (trainee, who actually discovered NMP as the appropriate solvent to keep the growing polymer as long as possible in solution; he also discovered that high speed mixing of PPD and TDC was necessary to obtain a sufficiently long polymer chains). The patent of the newly discovered process route led to a patent war between AKZO (Fibre X) and DuPont (Fibre B) as Dupont initially used the carcinogenic HMPT (hexamethylphosphoramide). Despite heavy research DuPont now also applies the AKZO patent for their Kevlar process and use the less hazardous NMP. Spinning After the production of the Twaron polymer in Delfzijl, the polymer is brought to Emmen, where fibres are produced by spinning the dissolved polymer into a solid fibre from a liquid chemical blend. Polymer solvent for spinning PPTA is generally 100% anhydrous (water free) sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The polymer is dissolved by mixing frozen sulfuric acid in powder form with the polymer in powder form and gently heating the mixture. This process, which differs from the more difficult DuPont process, was invented by Henri Lammers and patented by AKZO. Use Rifle protection police shield. Stops 7.62 and 5.56 ball.

The use of these is not confined to India, but extends to Arabia.\\"Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren, Historical Researches Into the Politics, Intercourse, and Trade of the Principal Nations of Antiquity, Henry Bohn, 1854 p38 The Greek historian, Theophrastus, states that much of the islands were covered in these cotton trees and that Tylos was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon.Arnold Heeren, ibid, p441 Ares was also worshipped by the country's indigenous and Greek population.See Ares, Ares in the Arabian Peninsula section It is not known whether Bahrain was part of the Seleucid Empire, although the archaeological site at Qalat Al Bahrain has been proposed as a Seleucid base in the Persian Gulf.Classical Greece: Ancient histories and modern archaeologies, Ian Morris, Routledge, p184 Alexander had planned to settle the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf with Greek colonists, and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged, Tylos was very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams.Phillip Ward, Bahrain: A Travel Guide, Oleander Press p68 Tylos even became the site of Greek athletic contests.W.

Larsen. Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society University Of Chicago Press, 1984 p13 The Greek historian Strabo believed that the Phoenicians originated from Bahrain. Herodotus also believed that the homeland of the Phoenicians was Bahrain. This theory was accepted by the 19th-century German classicist Arnold Heeren who said that: \\"In the Greek geographers, for instance, we read of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and Arad, Bahrain, which boasted that they were the mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples.\\"Arnold Heeren, p441 The people of Tyre in particular have long maintained Persian Gulf origins, and the similarity in the words \\"Tylos\\" and \\"Tyre\\" has been commented upon. However, there is little evidence of occupation at all in Bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place. Herodotus's account (written c. 440 BC) refers to the Phoenicians originating from Bahrain. (History, I:1). With the waning of Seleucid Greek power, Tylos was incorporated into Characene or Mesenian, the state founded in what today is Kuwait by Hyspaosines in 127BC. A building inscription found in Bahrain indicates that Hyspoasines occupied the islands, (and it also mention his wife, Thalassia).IKEO 147/427 - English translation. From the third century BC to the arrival of Islam in the seventh century AD, Bahrain was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties; the Parthians and Sassanids. By about 250 BC, the Seleucids lost their territories to Parthians, an Iranian tribe from Central Asia. The Parthian dynasty brought the Persian Gulf under their control and extended their influence as far as Oman. Because they needed to control the Persian Gulf trade route, the Parthians established garrisons in the southern coast of the Persian Gulf.Bahrain By Federal Research Division, page 7 Asia in 600 CE, showing the Sassanid Empire before the Arab conquest.

At this time, Bahrain was incorporated into the southern Sassanid province covering the Persian Gulf's southern shore, plus the archipelago of Bahrain. This southern province was subdivided into three districts of Haggar (now al-Hafuf province, Saudi Arabia), Batan Ardashir (now al-Qatif province, Saudi Arabia), and Mishmahig (now Bahrain Island) (in Middle Persian/Pahlavi means \\"ewe-fish\\".Yoma 77a and Rosh Hashbanah, 23a) included the Bahrain archipelago which was earlier called Aval, but later, in the Islamic era, became known as Bahrain.

She was the first Batch 3 to be built, and the last to decommission. Cornwall was based at HMNB Devonport in Devon, England, part of the Devonport Flotilla. She was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders and launched by Diana, Princess of Wales at Scotstoun on the River Clyde in October 1985 and commissioned at Falmouth in 1988 by the ship's sponsor, Diana, Princess of Wales (who was also the Duchess of Cornwall). Service Originally lead ship (Captain F) of the Devonport based 8th Frigate Squadron and upon its disbandment in 1993, lead ship of the 2nd Frigate Squadron, HMS Cornwall had battle honours from Barfleur in 1692, the Falkland Islands in 1914 and the Dardanelles in 1915. Cornwall was affectionately dubbed \\"the Fighting Ice Cream\\" by her crew due to her pennant number of F99. She undertook duties in the North and South Atlantic Ocean, Adriatic, Mediterranean, Caribbean and Baltic Seas throughout her time in service, and completed several patrols to the Persian Gulf and deployments to the Far East. During 1988 and 1989 she was commanded by Captain Chris Wreford- Brown. In 1992 she deployed to the West Indies as West Indies Guard ship, visiting Bermuda, Tortola, Belize, The Bahamas, Pensacola, Key West and Curacao before making her way home up the East Coast of the US and Canada via Norfolk, Boston and Halifax. In 1993 she deployed to the Gulf with a mid- deployment break to Mombasa in Kenya. 1994 saw her return again to the Gulf but this time visiting Singapore, Penang, Tioman Island and Sri Lanka whilst off station. En route back from the Far East, the ship took the opportunity to stop and lay a wreath at the site of the sinking of the previous , a County Class heavy cruiser sunk by Japanese dive bombers in April 1942. Between 1996 and 1998 she was commanded by Captain Anthony Dymock. In 1996 she served as flagship of the First Sea Lord in Saint Petersburg, during the 300th anniversary celebrations of the Russian Navy, followed by a period as flagship of NATO's Standing Naval Force Atlantic. In 2001 she was part of the Royal Navy Task Force engaged in the invasion of Afghanistan. In 2003 she was again committed to Standing Naval Force Atlantic, supporting Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean dressed overall at Zeebrugge, Belgium, July 2006 Following the death of the Princess of Wales in 1997, the role of sponsor was assumed by Mary Holborow, Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall. Between 1999 and 2001 she was commanded by Captain Timothy McClement. Ceremonial activities have included acting as flagship for the Battle of the Atlantic Fleet Review in 1993, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic, and in 2002 delivering a 21-gun salute as part of celebrations of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. On 28 January 2006 Cornwall was rededicated, following a period of docked maintenance, in a ceremony at Falmouth attended by Lady Mary Holborow. On 23 March 2007, fifteen sailors and Royal Marines from HMS Cornwall were detained by elements of the Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution following a routine search of a vessel suspected of smuggling, in the vicinity of disputed territorial waters. In February 2011, while operating in the Gulf of Aden as part of the Combined Maritime Forces, boarding teams from HMS Cornwall participated in the rescue of five Yemeni fishermen and the capture of 17 Somali pirates from a fishing dhow, which had been seized by pirates on 11 November 2010. HMS Cornwall enters Devonport for the final time, 26 April 2011 Decommissioning and disposal On 26 April 2011 she returned to Plymouth for the last time, and decommissioned on 30 June 2011. Her decommissioning pennant was presented to the Davidstow Airfield and Cornwall at War Museum on 5 October 2011. The ship's bell was presented to Truro Cathedral on 18 October 2011. She was later towed to HMNB Portsmouth, where she lay with sister ships HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham. All four were put up for sale in January 2013 and in July sold to Swansea Drydocks for demolition. She left Portsmouth, being towed to Swansea, on 24 October 2013.

It is a resident bird in the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. It carves out holes inside a tree to build its nest. It is predominantly frugivorous, but has been observed eating insects, especially winged termites. Description Juvenile coppersmith barbet in Kolkata The coppersmith barbet is green with a red head, yellow cheeks and a yellow throat. Its underparts are streaked in grey and black. During the nesting season, the wear and tear on the feathers can cause the plumage of the upper back to appear bluish. It is long and weighs .  Taxonomy  Bucco haemacephalus was the scientific name proposed by Philipp Ludwig Statius M√ºller in 1776 for a barbet from the Philippines. Bucco indicus was proposed by John Latham in 1790 for a streaked barbet from India with a black head and red forehead. Bucco roseus was proposed by Charles Dumont de Sainte-Croix in 1816. Asian barbets were placed in the genus Megalaima proposed by George Robert Gray in 1842 who suggested to use this name instead of Bucco. Xantholaema intermedia proposed by George Ernest Shelley in 1891 were barbets from Negros and Cebu islands in the collection of the British Museum. Megalaima haemacephala delica proposed by Carl Parrot in 1910 were four barbets from Deli and Sumatra in the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology. Megalaima haemacephala mindanensis proposed by Austin L. Rand in 1948 was a coppersmith barbet from Mount Apo in Mindanao. Megalaema haemacephala celestinoi proposed by Ernest Thomas Gilliard in 1949 was a coppersmith barbet from Samar island of the Philippines. Megalaema haemacephala cebuensis and Megalaema haemacephala homochroa proposed by Victoria Dziadosz and Kenneth Parkes in 1984 were coppersmith barbets from Toledo, Cebu and Tablas Island, respectively. Molecular phylogenetic research of barbets revealed that Megalaima species form a clade, which also includes the fire-tufted barbet, the only species placed in the genus Psilopogon at the time. Asian barbets were therefore reclassified under Psilopogon, which is the older scientific name. The coppersmith barbet is one of the oldest Asian barbets in terms of genetic divergence and speciation. Nine coppersmith barbet subspecies are recognized as of 2014: * the nominate subspecies P. h. haemacephalus occurs in Luzon and Mindoro * P. h. indicus ranges from northeastern Pakistan to Sri Lanka, China, Vietnam and Singapore * P. h. roseus occurs in Java and Bali * P. h. intermedia occurs in Panay, Guimaras and Negros * P. h. delicus occurs in Sumatra * P. h. mindanensis occurs in Mindanao * P. h. celestinoi occurs in Samar, Catanduanes, Biliran, and Leyte * P. h. cebuensis occurs in Cebu * P. h. homochroa occurs in Tablas Island  Distribution and habitat  Coppersmith barbet in Queen Sirikit Park Throughout its range, it inhabits gardens, groves and sparse woodland. Habitats with dead wood suitable for excavation of nests are important. In the Palni Hills it occurs below . In northern India, it occurs in the valleys of the outer Himalayas up to . It is rare in northwestern Indian states and in wet forests in Assam. The coppersmith barbet's range overlaps with several larger barbets in most of South Asia. In the Western Ghats, its range partly overlaps with the Malabar barbet. Behaviour and ecology Coppersmith barbet at Gujarat refinery township Vadodara The coppersmith barbet lives solitary or in small groups; larger parties have occasionally been sighted in abundantly fruiting Ficus trees. It appears to be fond of sunning in the morning on bare top branches of tall trees, often flitting about to sit next to each other. Its flight is straight, with rapid flaps. It competes with other cavity nesting birds and frugivores. Blue-throated barbets have been seen evicting coppersmith barbets from their nest holes, while red-vented bulbuls have been seen to indulge in kleptoparasitism, robbing the male of berries brought to the female at the nest. The nest holes are also used for roosting and some birds roost alone in cavities and these often roost during part of the day. Immatures will roost with the parents but often return to roost early so as not to be prevented by the parents from entering the roost cavity. Vocalization The call is a loud rather metallic tuk‚Ä¶tuk‚Ä¶tuk (or tunk), reminiscent of a copper sheet being beaten, giving the bird its name. Repeated monotonously for long periods, starting with a subdued tuk and building up to an even volume and tempo, the latter varying from 108 to 121 per minute and can continue with as many as 204 notes. They are silent and do not call in winter. The beak remains shut during each call - a patch of bare skin on both sides of the throat inflates and collapses with each tuk like a rubber bulb and the head is bobbed. Diet The coppersmith barbet prefers banyan, peepul, and other wild figs, various drupes and berries, and the occasional insect, caught in aerial sallies. It also feeds on flower petals. It eats nearly 1.5 to nearly 3 times its own body weight in berries each day. Breeding Courtship involves singing, puffing of the throat, bobbing of the head, flicking of the tail, ritual feeding and allopreening. Birds nest and roost in cavities. It breeds through much of the year with local variation. The breeding season is mainly February to April in India and December to September in Sri Lanka. Both sexes excavate the nest on the underside of a narrow horizontal branch. They also roost inside the nest holes. The female lays three or four eggs. Both sexes incubate. The Incubation period is not well known, but has been estimated to be about two weeks. Often two broods are raised in quick succession. Mortality factors Adult birds are sometimes taken by predatory species. In urban areas, there are records of collisions with structures including white walls. Pesticide poisoning has also been noted.

Early and family life  He was born in 1734, the third son of a priest, Archibald Inglis, the rector of Glencolmcille, a remote parish in southwest County Donegal, on the rugged west coast of the Irish province of Ulster. Ministry Inglis became rector of Killybegs, Donegal, but in 1755 he sailed to America and worked as a teacher under the auspices of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. In 1758 the Bishop of London ordained him as a priest. Rev. Inglis spent several years in Delaware before moving to Trinity Church in New York in 1765, where his oldest child Charles is buried. Trinity Church, New York Following the British occupation of New York in 1777, Inglis was promoted from curate to rector of Trinity Church. As a Loyalist, it is recorded that Inglis prayed aloud for King George III while George Washington was in the congregation. The church was quickly surrounded by militia. Inglis' home was plundered. In November 1783, upon the evacuation of Loyalists from New York, Inglis returned to England. However, his whole congregation of Trinity Church went to Nova Scotia. On 11 August 1787, George III created the Diocese of Nova Scotia by Letters Patent, and named Inglis its first bishop. He preached at St. Paul's Church (Halifax). The independence of the thirteen colonies which would form the United States had led to the creation of a new, autonomous, Anglican church there, with Samuel Seabury as the first bishop, but Inglis was the first Church of England bishop in North America, though technically his Episcopal see was \\"the Province of Nova Scotia\\". Eager to increase the status of Anglicanism in the colonies, he supported the 1789 foundation of King's Collegiate School in Windsor, Nova Scotia, as an exclusive academy for sons of the Anglican elite. He also backed several missionary efforts to turn the majority of the population from their dissenting religious beliefs. These efforts were largely unsuccessful. Death and legacy Charles and son John Inglis memorial, St. Paul's Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia Bishop Inglis died on 24 February 1816 at Kingston, Nova Scotia. He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul's Church (Halifax). His son John Inglis, also became an Anglican bishop. There is a silver plaque in honour of Charles Inglis St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He became a Doctor of Divinity.

Founded in 1850, the central portion of the present campus was acquired in 1854 with the first building erected in 1856.  History  The university was founded in 1850 as a private four-year college in Bloomington, Illinois. Potential departmental closures In May 2020, IWU's board of trustees endorsed a recommendation it received from the university's \\"The Council of University Programs and Policy\\" faculty group to close or shrink several departments. The departments that would be cut or closed, according to the recommendation, are American Cultural Studies, Design, Technology and Entrepreneurship, Greek and Roman Studies, and International Business. The college sent pre-termination notices on June 12, 2020 to 25 tenured faculty. The faculty who received these notices are in the departments of Anthropology, Philosophy, Religion, Sociology, the School of Music, and French and Italian within the department of World Languages Literatures and Cultures. The letters received by faculty informed them that their position was under review for possible termination. Altogether, roughly 21% of IWU‚Äôs faculty received a pre- termination letter.  Academics  Illinois Wesleyan is an independent, residential, university with an approximate enrollment of 1,700. It offers over 80 majors, minors and programs. The university maintains a low student/faculty ratio of 10 to 1, with an average class size of 15 Also, more than 9 in 10 IWU students receive a scholarship or need-based assistance. Illinois Wesleyan is also a member of the Annapolis Group and has chapters in the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi honor societies. The university consists of the College of Liberal Arts, with 17 academic departments; the College of Fine Arts that includes three professional schools‚Äîthe Ames School of Art, School of Music and the School of Theatre Arts; and the School of Nursing. Several of the programs within these units are being proposed for elimination. Illinois Wesleyan's campus occupies approximately a short walk north from downtown Bloomington in central Illinois. IWU's School of Nursing was established in 1959. Applicants apply directly to the School of Nursing and typically graduate in four years with a BSN. The course work emphasizes clinical placement and individualized education and experience. Bachelor's degree programs are offered in three colleges:Illinois Wesleyan University website, \\"Degrees and Majors\\", accessed 12/06/2007. iwu.edu *College of Liberal Arts: 17 departments and 7 interdisciplinary programs, organized in 1906 *College of Fine Arts: Schools of art, music, and theatre arts organized in 1929, 1946, 1947 respectively *School of Nursing: Established in 1959 Ames Library The Ames Library Illinois Wesleyan's Ames Library was completed in 2002. It contains over 368,000 volumes spread over five floors. The Ames Library also houses eight sets of stained glass panels originally from Pembroke College at Oxford University. Among the special collections are the papers of former U.S. Representative Leslie C. Arends; the Gernon collection of first editions of detective fiction and mysteries; and the Schultz collection of 18th- and 19th- century British drama, including The Beggar's Opera. Construction cost $25.7 million; Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbot were the principal architects.Ames Facts IWU May Term Illinois Wesleyan offers a May Term course option. The university refers to it as a 4‚Äì4‚Äì1 system. This allows any student who has completed a full course-load in either the spring or fall semesters of that academic year to enroll in a May Term class. May Term classes last approximately three weeks during the month of May. Students take several hours of instruction in the same course each day for five days each week. This allows the students to immerse themselves in that one topic. At the end of the May Term a student completes the equivalent of a single course during one semester. May Term emphasizes curricular experimentation, and also offers an opportunity for service projects, study abroad, and internships. Study abroad Illinois Wesleyan offers a number of study abroad opportunities, and ranks in the top 40 schools in the nation for students studying abroad., Open Doors Report. IWU's International Office provides support for over 300 global Study Abroad Options in 70 countries through various institutes such as IES and SIT Study Abroad. Domestically, IWU offers a UN semester, a Washington Semester, and the Associated Colleges of the Midwest Chicago Program. Internationally it offers programs in London and Barcelona. It also maintains a very strong relationship with Pembroke College, Oxford, and traditionally a few juniors can spend a year there as exchange students. Research The university publishes several different undergraduate research journals in the fields of political science, economics, history, and English. Perhaps the first of its kind, the Undergraduate Economic Review is a student-managed, open access journal that has published original undergraduate content from students in the U.S. and at least 15 other countries. Its \\"internal twin\\", the Park Place Economist, publishes original work of Economics seniors graduating Illinois Wesleyan University. Articles range from basic topical explorations to focused senior research. All published volumes are available online. The John Wesley Powell Student Research Conference was established in 1990 to provide opportunities for students to present research projects and findings in a public and interactive manner. The Action Research Center was established in 2004 to partner student research and service projects with the wider Illinois community.  Athletics  Shirk Center at Illinois Wesleyan University Illinois Wesleyan University participates in the NCAA's Division III and is a member of the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW). Illinois Wesleyan teams have won 136 CCIW Titles and 6 Division III National Championships. Illinois Wesleyan has produced 117 Academic All-American student athletes since the program began in 1970, a total that is tied for 13th among all participating colleges and universities, regardless of NCAA division. Illinois Wesleyan University's Division III athletic teams, known as the \\"Titans,\\" helped found the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) in 1946. Illinois Wesleyan was a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1910 to 1937. The Titans have 22 varsity teams, 11 men's and 11 women's, with the addition of men's and women's lacrosse in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1679 in favour of the soldier and politician Charles Gerard, 1st Baron Gerard. He had already been created Baron Gerard, of Brandon in the County of Suffolk, in 1645, and was made Viscount Brandon, of Brandon in the County of Suffolk, at the same time as he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of England. Lord Macclesfield was the great-grandson of the distinguished judge Sir Gilbert Gerard, Master of the Rolls from 1581 to 1594. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was involved in the Rye House Plot of 1683, was sentenced to death but later pardoned by the King. On his death without legitimate issue in 1701 the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Earl. He had earlier represented Yarmouth, Lancaster and Lancashire in the House of Commons. When he died in 1702 the titles became extinct. William Dorington or Dorrington, Colonel of the King's Royal Irish Regiment of Foot Guards, was created Earl of Macclesfield in the Jacobite Peerage in or about 1716. The title, such as it was, became extinct in 1841.Melville de Massue de Ruvigny, The Jacobite Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage & Grants of Honour (Edinburgh: T.C. & E.C. Jack, 1904), 83-84 The second creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1721 when the noted lawyer Thomas Parker, 1st Baron Parker, was made Viscount Parker, of Ewelm in the County of Oxford, and Earl of Macclesfield, in the County Palatine of Chester. He was Lord Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench from 1710 to 1718 and Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1718 to 1725. Parker had already been created Lord Parker, Baron of Macclesfield, in the County Palatine of Chester, in 1716. This title is also in the Peerage of Great Britain. In contrast to the barony the viscountcy and earldom were created with remainder, in default of male issue, to his daughter Elizabeth, wife of Sir William Heathcote, 1st Baronet of Hursley Park, and her issue male. In 1725 Lord Macclesfield was convicted of corruption and forced to pay a ¬£30,000 fine. He was succeeded by his son George, the second Earl, who was a distinguished astronomer and served as President of the Royal Society for many years. On George's death the titles passed to his son Thomas, the third Earl. He had sat as Member of Parliament for Newcastle under Lyme, Oxfordshire and Rochester. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was a prominent politician and served as President of the Board of Agriculture from 1816 to 1818. When he died the titles passed to his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl. He had represented Oxfordshire in the House of Commons as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his grandson, the seventh Earl. He was the son of George Augustus Parker, Viscount Parker, eldest son of the sixth Earl. Lord Macclesfield was Lord-Lieutenant of Oxfordshire from 1954 to 1963. the titles are held by his grandson, the ninth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1992. Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, first husband of the Duchess of Cornwall, is the son of Derek Henry Parker-Bowles (who assumed his mother's maiden surname of Bowles), grandson of Reverend the Hon. Algernon Robert Parker, third son of the sixth Earl. Consequently, he is in distant remainder to the earldom and its subsidiary titles. Another member of the family was the Right Reverend Wilfrid Parker (1883‚Äì1966), son of the Hon. Cecil Thomas Parker, second son of the sixth Earl. He served as Bishop of Pretoria (1933-1950). The family seat of the Parker family is Shirburn Castle, near Oxford, but the castle and estate is held by the Beechwood Estates Company, the Macclesfield family estate management company. Following a long- running and acrimonious court battle, the ninth Earl was evicted from the family seat at the end of 2004.

It is widespread from the Terai in both Nepal and India to Sri Lanka, and listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is an arboreal species of gardens and wooded country which eats fruit and insects. It is fairly tolerant of humans and often seen in city parks. It nests in a tree hole, laying 2-4 eggs. It forages on mangos, ripe jackfruit, papaya, banana, figs and similar cultivated fruit trees. Its habitat includes urban and country gardens though it tends to eschew heavy forest. It nests in a suitable hole in a tree that it will often excavate. Both sexes incubate the eggs and often communicate with each other using their Kura, kura calls. The adult has a streaked brown head, neck and breast, and a yellow eye patch. The rest of the plumage is green. It is long with a large head, short neck and short tail. Its call is a repetitive kutroo‚Ä¶kutroo‚Ä¶kutroo, but silent in the winter. Others take up the call when one starts.

It was created in 1729 for James Waldegrave, 2nd Baron Waldegrave. History The Waldegrave family descends from Sir Richard Waldegrave, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1381 to 1382. His son and namesake, Sir Richard Waldegrave, was a soldier and fought in the Hundred Years' War. His descendant Sir Edward Waldegrave was a politician and courtier. A prominent Catholic, he held office under Queen Mary I, who granted him the Chewton estate in Somerset. However, Waldegrave was imprisoned in the Tower of London after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, where he died in 1561. His grandson Edward Waldegrave fought as a Royalist in the Civil War despite his old age. In 1643 he was created a baronet, of Hever Castle in the County of Kent, in the Baronetage of England. Henry Waldegrave, the fourth Baronet and Richard's great-grandson (the title having descended from father to son), married Henrietta FitzJames, illegitimate daughter of King James II and his mistress Arabella Churchill. Mainly thanks to this marriage Waldegrave was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Waldegrave, of Chewton in the County of Somerset. He was succeeded by his son James Waldegrave, the second Baron. He served as Ambassador to the Holy Roman Empire and to France. In 1729 he was honoured when he was created Viscount Chewton, of Chewton in the County of Somerset, and Earl Waldegrave in the Peerage of Great Britain. On his death the titles passed to his son, the second Earl. He was invited to form a government by the King in 1757, but was unsuccessful (and is normally not considered to have held the post of Prime Minister). Lord Waldegrave married Maria Walpole, illegitimate daughter of Edward Walpole, son of Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole. He died without male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. He was a general in the Army and also held political office. When he died the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He fought in the American Revolutionary War and also represented Newcastle-under-Lyme in the House of Commons of Great Britain. His eldest son, the fifth Earl, died from drowning at the age of nine. The young Earl was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. He was a soldier and commanded the 54th Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Waterloo. He was succeeded by his eldest legitimate son, the seventh Earl. He died childless at an early age and was succeeded by his uncle, the eighth Earl. He was a vice- admiral in the Royal Navy and also sat as Member of Parliament for Bedford. His eldest son William Frederick Waldegrave, Viscount Chewton, died in 1854 from wounds received at the Battle of Alma during the Crimean War. Lord Waldegrave was therefore succeeded by his grandson, the ninth Earl (the eldest son of Viscount Chewton). He was a Conservative politician and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1896 to 1905. He was succeeded by his only son, the tenth Earl. He never married and on his death in 1933 the titles passed to his uncle, the eleventh Earl. He was the second son of the aforementioned Viscount Chewton. On his death the titles passed to his only son, the twelfth Earl. He sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and served as Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1957 to 1962. Lord Waldegrave also held the honorary post of Lord Warden of the Stannaries from 1965 to 1976. the titles are held by his eldest son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1995. Three other members of the Waldegrave family have also gained distinction. The Hon. William Waldegrave, second son of the third Earl, was a prominent naval commander and was created Baron Radstock in 1800 (see this title for further information on this branch of the family). The Hon. Samuel Waldegrave, second son of the eighth Earl, was a clergyman and served as Bishop of Carlisle from 1860 to 1869. The Hon. William Waldegrave, second son of the twelfth Earl, is a Conservative politician and was created a life peer as Baron Waldegrave of North Hill in 1999. The family seat is Chewton House, near Chewton Mendip, Somerset. As suggested by the territorial designation of the baronetcy, the family once owned Hever Castle. The family's coat of arms is one of the easiest to describe: Per pale argent and gules. Its supporters are two talbots, sable, eared or, gorged with a coronet argent. The crest is a set of five plumes.

The cooling grill for the brake grid resistors is at the top center of the locomotive. Dynamic braking is the use of an electric traction motor as a generator when slowing a vehicle such as an electric or diesel-electric locomotive. It is termed \\"rheostatic\\" if the generated electrical power is dissipated as heat in brake grid resistors, and \\"regenerative\\" if the power is returned to the supply line. Dynamic braking reduces wear on friction-based braking components, and regeneration lowers net energy consumption. Dynamic braking may also be used on railcars with multiple units, light rail vehicles, electric trams, trolleybuses and electric and hybrid electric automobiles. Principle of operation Converting electrical energy to the mechanical energy of a rotating shaft (electric motor) is the inverse of converting the mechanical energy of a rotating shaft to electrical energy (electric generator). Both are accomplished through the interactions of armature windings with a (relatively) moving external magnetic field, with the armature connected to an electrical circuit with either a power supply (motor) or power receptor (generator). Since the role of the electrical/mechanical energy converting device is determined by which interface (mechanical or electrical) provides or receives energy, the same device can fulfill the role of either a motor or a generator. In dynamic braking, the traction motor is switched into the role of a generator by switching from a supply circuit to a receptor circuit while applying electric current to the field coils that generate the magnetic field (excitation). The amount of resistance applied to the rotating shaft (braking power) equals the rate of electrical power generation plus some efficiency loss. That is in turn proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, controlled by the current in the field coils, and the rate at which the armature and magnetic field rotate against each other, determined by the rotation of the wheels and the ratio of power shaft to wheel rotation. The amount of braking power is controlled by varying the strength of the magnetic field through the amount of current in the field coils. As the rate of electrical power generation, and conversely braking power, are proportional to the rate at which the power shaft is spinning, a stronger magnetic field is required to maintain braking power as speed decreases and there is a lower limit at which dynamic braking can be effective depending on the current available for application to the field coils. The two main methods of managing the electricity generated during dynamic braking are rheostatic braking and regenerative braking, as described below. For permanent magnet motors, dynamic braking is easily achieved by shorting the motor terminals, thus bringing the motor to a fast abrupt stop. This method, however, dissipates all the energy as heat in the motor itself, and so cannot be used in anything other than low- power intermittent applications due to cooling limitations. It is not suitable for traction applications. Rheostatic braking The electrical energy produced by the motors is dissipated as heat by a bank of onboard resistors, referred to as the braking grid. Large cooling fans are necessary to protect the resistors from damage. Modern systems have thermal monitoring, so, if the temperature of the bank becomes excessive, it will be switched off, and the braking will revert to friction only. Regenerative braking In electrified systems the process of regenerative braking is employed whereby the current produced during braking is fed back into the power supply system for use by other traction units, instead of being wasted as heat. It is normal practice to incorporate both regenerative and rheostatic braking in electrified systems. If the power supply system is not \\"receptive\\", i.e. incapable of absorbing the current, the system will default to rheostatic mode in order to provide the braking effect. Yard locomotives with onboard energy storage systems which allow the recovery of some of the energy which would otherwise be wasted as heat are now available. The Green Goat model, for example, is being used by Canadian Pacific Railway, BNSF Railway, Kansas City Southern Railway and Union Pacific Railroad. On modern passenger locomotives equipped with AC inverters pulling trains with sufficient head-end power (HEP) loads, braking energy can be used to power the train's on board systems via regenerative braking if the electrification system is not receptive or even if the track is not electrified to begin with. The HEP load on modern passenger trains is so great that some new electric locomotives such as the ALP-46 were designed without the traditional resistance grids. Blended braking A Connex South Eastern Class 466 EMU at London Blackfriars station in 2006, which has been fitted with dynamic blended braking Dynamic braking alone is not enough to stop a locomotive, as its braking effect rapidly diminishes below about . Therefore, it is always used in conjunction with the regular air brake. This combined system is called blended braking. Li-ion batteries have also been used to store energy for use in bringing trains to a complete halt. Although blended braking combines both dynamic and air braking, the resulting braking force is designed to be the same as what the air brakes on their own provide. This is achieved by maximizing the dynamic brake portion, and automatically regulating the air brake portion, as the main purpose of dynamic braking is to reduce the amount of air braking required. This conserves air, and minimizes the risks of over-heated wheels. One locomotive manufacturer, Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD), estimates that dynamic braking provides between 50% to 70% of the braking force during blended braking. Self-load test It is possible to use the brake grids as a form of dynamometer or load bank to perform a \\"self load\\" test of locomotive engine horsepower. With the locomotive stationary, the main generator (MG) output is connected to the grids instead of the traction motors. The grids are normally large enough to absorb the full engine output power, which is calculated from MG voltage and current output. Hydrodynamic braking Diesel locomotives with hydraulic transmission may be equipped for hydrodynamic braking. In this case, the torque converter or fluid coupling acts as a retarder in the same way as a water brake. Braking energy heats the hydraulic fluid, and the heat is dissipated (via a heat exchanger) by the engine cooling radiator. The engine will be idling (and producing little heat) during braking, so the radiator is not overloaded.

Elvaston Castle today. Elvaston Castle. Earl of Harrington is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain that was created in 1742. Origins It was created in 1742 for William Stanhope, 1st Baron Harrington, the former Secretary of State and then Lord President of the Council, who in 1730 had already been created Baron Harrington, of Harrington in the County of Northampton, and who was also made Viscount Petersham at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Stanhope was the son of John Stanhope of Elvaston and the great-grandson of Sir John Stanhope of Elvaston, younger half-brother of Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield (who was the grandfather of James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope). Lord Harrington was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was a General in the Army and also represented Bury St Edmunds in the House of Commons. His son, the third Earl, was also a General in the Army and sat as Member of Parliament for Thetford and Westminster. His elder son, the fourth Earl, and younger son, the fifth Earl, were both Colonels in the Army. The line of the fifth Earl failed on the early death of his son, the sixth Earl, in 1866. The late Earl was succeeded by his first cousin, the seventh Earl. He was the son of the Very Reverend the Hon. FitzRoy Henry Richard, fourth son of the third Earl. His elder son, the eighth Earl, was a successful polo player. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the ninth Earl. his grandson, the eleventh Earl, succeeded his father in 1929. In 1967, the 11th Earl also succeeded as eighth Viscount Stanhope of Mahon and eighth Baron Stanhope of Elvaston on the death of his distant relative James Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope, by a special remainder in the latter's patent that allowed these titles to be inherited by the male heirs of the aforementioned John Stanhope, father of the first Earl of Harrington. , the titles are held by the eleventh Earl's son, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded his father in 2009. The family seat now is The Glen, near Ballingarry, Limerick. The former family seat was Elvaston Castle, in Derbyshire. The house and Grounds are currently owned by Derbyshire County Council, which has opened the gardens as a country park. The 5th Earl had a London townhouse built on land formerly belonging to Kensington Palace: Harrington House remained in the family until the First World War. It is currently home to the Russian Embassy.

He was the author of 50 plays, four volumes of short stories, two volumes of essays, much journalism and a book on the subject, a children's book, some poetry, and other assorted writings. His plays have been translated into 20 languages and performed worldwide. Early life Wesker was born in Stepney, London, in 1932, the son of Leah (n√©e Cecile Leah Perlmutter), a cook, and Joseph Wesker, a tailor's machinist, and an active communist. He was delivered by Samuel Sacks, father of neurologist Oliver Sacks. He attended a Jewish Infants School in Whitechapel. His education was then fragmented during World War II. He was briefly evacuated to Ely, Cambridgeshire, before returning to London where he attended Dean Street School during the Blitz. He then returned to live with his parents who had moved to a council flat in Hackney, East London, where he attended Northwold Road School. He then attended Upton House Central School, Hackney, from 1943. This was a school where emphasis was placed on teaching office skills including typing to brighter boys who had not been selected for grammar school places. He was then evacuated again to Llantrisant, South Wales.An education in the life of Arnold Wesker at The Independent Retrieved 13 April 2016 He was accepted in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but could not afford to take up his place there. Later he served for two years in the Royal Air Force and then went on to work as cook, furniture maker, bookseller. After saving up enough money, he went to study at the London School of Film Technique, now known as the London Film School Career His inspiration for 1957 play The Kitchen, which was later made into a film, came when he was working at the Bell Hotel in Norwich. It was while working here that he met his future wife Dusty. Wesker's plays have dealt with themes including self-discovery, love, confronting death and political disillusion. Chicken Soup with Barley (1958) went out to the provinces, and rather than opening in the West End, its premiere was seen at the provincial Coventry Theatre, a locale which typified Wesker's political views as an 'angry young man'. Wesker's play Roots (1959) was a kitchen sink drama about a girl, Beatie Bryant, who returns after three years of stay in London to her farming family home at Norfolk and struggles to voice herself. Critics commended the \\"emotional authenticity\\" brought out in the play. Roots, The Kitchen, and Their Very Own and Golden City were staged by the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre under the management of George Devine and later William Gaskill. Nuclear disarmament Wesker joined with enthusiasm the Royal Court group on the Aldermaston March in 1959. Another of the Royal Court contingent, Lindsay Anderson, made a short documentary film (March to Aldermaston) about the event. He was an active member of the Committee of 100 and, with other prominent members, was jailed in 1961 for his part in its campaign of mass nonviolent resistance to nuclear weapons. Centre 42 After his stay in prison in 1961, Wesker made a full-time commitment to become the leader of an initiative which arose from Resolution 42 of the 1960 Trades Union Congress, concerning the importance of arts in the community. Centre 42 was initially a touring festival aimed at devolving art and culture from London to the other main working class towns of Britain, moving to the Roundhouse in 1964. The project to establish a permanent arts centre struggled through subsequent years because its funding was limited and Wesker fictionalised it in his play Their Very Own and Golden City (1966). He formally dissolved the project in 1970, although The Roundhouse did eventually open as a permanent arts centre in 2006. Writers & Readers Publishing Cooperative He co-founded the Writers & Readers Publishing Cooperative Ltd with a group of writers that included John Berger, Lisa Appignanesi, Richard Appignanesi, Chris Searle and Glenn Thompson, in 1974. Later works The Journalists (1972) was commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company and researched at The Sunday Times at the time it was edited by Harold Evans. The RSC's literary manager Ronald Bryden thought it would be \\"the play of the decade\\" and it was scheduled to be directed by David Jones. The actors in that year's RSC company refused to perform it, Wesker claimed, because they were under the influence of the Workers Revolutionary Party. (The WRP was not founded until 1973, but its forerunner, the Socialist Labour League had many sympathisers in the RSC.) Wesker wrote in 2004 that he had also \\"committed the politically incorrect crime of creating Tory ministers who were intelligent rather than caricatures\\". Wesker's play The Merchant (1976), which he later renamed Shylock, uses the same three stories used by Shakespeare for his play The Merchant of Venice. In this retelling, Shylock and Antonio are fast friends bound by a common love of books, culture and a disdain for the crass antisemitism of the Christian community's laws. They make the bond in defiant mockery of the Christian establishment, never anticipating that the bond might become forfeit. When it does, the play argues, Shylock must carry through on the letter of the law or jeopardize the scant legal security of the entire Jewish community. He is, therefore, quite as grateful as Antonio when Portia, as in Shakespeare's play, shows the legal way out. The play received its American premiere on 16 November 1977 at New York's Plymouth Theatre with Joseph Leon as Shylock, Marian Seldes as Shylock's sister Rivka and Roberta Maxwell as Portia. This production had a challenging history in previews on the road, culminating (after the first night out of town in Philadelphia on 8 September 1977) with the death of the exuberant Broadway star Zero Mostel, who was initially cast as Shylock. Wesker wrote a book, The Birth of Shylock and the Death of Zero Mostel, chronicling the entire process from initial submissions and rejections of the play through to rehearsals, Zero's death, and the disappointment of the critical reception for the Broadway opening. The book reveals much about the playwright's relationship to director John Dexter (who had been the earliest, near-familial interpreter of Wesker's works), to criticism, to casting, and to the ephemeral process of collaboration through which the text of any play must pass.Selected works In 2005, he published his first novel, Honey, which recounted the experiences of Beatie Bryant, the heroine of his earlier play Roots. The novel broke from the previously established chronology. Roots was set in the early 1960s and Beatie is 22; but in Honey she has only aged three years yet the action has been transplanted into the 1980s. Other oddities are that the timeframe includes the Rushdie affair and John Major's fall as recent events and yet the action is concerned with the dotcom boom. In 2008, Wesker published his first collection of poetry, All Things Tire of Themselves (Flambard Press). The collection dates back many years and represents what he considered his best and most characteristic poems. He was a member of the editorial advisory board of Jewish Renaissance magazine. He was a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres. He was the castaway on Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, on in 1966 and again in 2006. Archive Wesker's papers, covering his entire career, were acquired by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 2000. The collection contains not only the prolific output of the playwright, novelist and poet but also is framed within the larger historical context of international events. Wesker was actively involved in the organizing of his archive, and before shipping it to the Ransom Center, Wesker compiled a list of the contents, which is also available to scholars for consultation. The collection's contents include over three hundred boxes of manuscript drafts, correspondence, production ephemera, personal records, and other materials. Wesker's family shipped the last of his papers to the Ransom Center in March, 2016 shortly before his death. On 13 April 2016, the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, gave thanks for the playwright's life. They shared a socialist background in London, where Corbyn is an MP. > I am sure the whole House will join me in mourning the death of the > dramatist Arnold Wesker, one of the great playwrights of this country, one > of those wonderful angry young men of the 1950s who, like so many angry > young people, changed the face of our country. The BBC repeated in May 2016 the retrospective radio programme on Wesker's career first broadcast at his 80th birthday. Personal life Wesker married Doreen Bicker, \\"Dusty\\", in 1958; the couple had three children Lindsay, Tanya and Daniel. Lindsay was named after director Lindsay Anderson. Tanya died in 2012. Wesker also had another daughter Elsa, with Swedish journalist, Disa H√•stad. He was grandfather to Swedish rapper Yung Lean. Wesker died on 12 April 2016. He was suffering from Parkinson's disease. Awards and Honours Wesker received numerous awards throughout his career. In 1958 he received grant of 300 for the play Chicken Soup from the Arts Council of Great Britain. He used the money to marry Bicker. The following year he won the Evening Standard Theatre Award in the \\"Most Promising Playwright\\" category. He was presented with the Italian Marzotto Prize (a cash award of ¬£3000) in 1964 for Their Very Own and Golden City, and the Spanish Best Foreign Play Award in 1979.

It was created in 1743 for John Wallop, 1st Viscount Lymington, who had previously represented Hampshire in the House of Commons. He had already been created Baron Wallop, of Farleigh Wallop in Hampshire in the County of Southampton, and Viscount Lymington, in 1720, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. The second earl was the son of Catherine Conduitt, whose mother was Catherine Barton, half-niece of the eminent mathematical scientist Sir Isaac Newton. The earls of Portsmouth therefore are direct descendants of Isaac Newton's mother, and three of the earls have been named after Newton. The earls were in possession of a large trove of Newton's personal papers, until they were auctioned in 1936. Those documents are commonly known as the \\"Portsmouth Papers\\". The third Earl declared himself King of Hampshire and his brother had him declared insane. The fourth Earl represented Andover and Devonshire North in Parliament. In 1794, he assumed by Royal licence for himself and his issue the surname and arms of Fellowes only. The fifth Earl resumed, without Royal licence, the family surname and arms of Wallop. The sixth Earl represented Barnstaple in Parliament as a Liberal. Oliver Henry Wallop, the eighth Earl, had moved from England to the United States, and been living the life of a rancher in Sheridan, Wyoming, at the time of the death of his older brother, the seventh Earl. Known as O.H.

The title was created for the first time in the Peerage of England in 1660 (as Countess of Guilford) for Elizabeth Boyle. She was a daughter of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh, and the widow of Lewis Boyle, 1st Viscount Boyle of Kinalmeaky. The title was for life only and became extinct on her death in 1667. The title was created for a second time in the Peerage of England in 1674 for John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale. For more information on this creation, see the article on him as well as the Earl of Lauderdale. Despite the first two creations, the title of Earl of Guilford is chiefly associated with one branch of the North family, which descends from the Hon. Sir Francis North, second son of Dudley North, 4th Baron North (see the Baron North for earlier history of the family), a lawyer and politician. He was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1675 to 1682 and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal from 1682 to 1685. In 1683 he was created Baron Guilford, of Guilford (now spelled Guildford) in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of England. He died in middle age and was succeeded by his son, the second Baron, who briefly served as President of the Board of Trade from 1713 to 1714 and was also Lord-Lieutenant of Essex. His son, the third Baron, represented Banbury in the House of Commons of Great Britain. In 1734 he succeeded his cousin as seventh Baron North and in 1752 was honoured by being created Earl of Guilford in the Peerage of Great Britain. The first Earl of the new creation was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. Known mainly under his courtesy title of Lord North, which he used from 1752 to 1790, he was one of the most influential statesmen of the second half of the 18th century. As Prime Minister of Great Britain between 1770 and 1782, he was a major figure in the American Revolution. North also held two of the other great offices of state, those of Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He represented several constituencies in the House of Commons. Lord Guilford had no sons, and on his death the barony of North fell into abeyance between his daughters (see the Baron North page for further history of this title). He was succeeded in the barony and the earldom of Guilford by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He had been one of the Members of Parliament for Banbury from 1792 to 1794 and had also served as Governor of Ceylon from 1798 to 1805. He was also childless, and on his death the titles passed to his cousin, the sixth Earl, a clergyman. He was succeeded by his grandson, the seventh Earl. His son, the eighth Earl, was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal East Kent Yeomanry. When he died the peerages were inherited by his grandson, the ninth Earl. As of 2009 the titles are held by the latter's only son, the tenth Earl, who succeeded in 1999. Three other members of the North family may also be mentioned. Frederic Dudley North (1866‚Äì1921), great-grandson of the Reverend Charles Augustus North, younger brother of the sixth earl, was a prominent civil servant in Australia. His son Charles Frederic North (1887‚Äì1979) was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1947 to 1953. Jonathan North (b. 1931), son of the Hon. John Montagu William North, second son of the eighth Earl, succeeded his maternal grandfather as second Baronet, of Southwell, in 1947 (see North Baronets). Lacking a different secondary title, the heirs apparent to the earldom have continued to use Lord North as a courtesy title. An unqualified reference to Lord North almost always refers to Frederick North, later second Earl of Guilford. The family seat is Waldershare House, near Dover, Kent. The town in Surrey from which both titles derive is now spelt Guildford.

The film was executive produced by Wes Craven, and is the only film of the Wishmaster series with his name attached. Its plot concerns a djinn, a wish-granting, evil genie who is released from a jewel and seeks to capture the soul of the woman who discovered him, thereby opening a portal and freeing his fellow djinn to inhabit and enslave the Earth. The film stars Andrew Divoff as The Djinn and Tammy Lauren. The film was followed by three sequels, Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies (1999), Wishmaster 3: Beyond the Gates of Hell (2001) and Wishmaster: The Prophecy Fulfilled (2002). Plot A narrator (Angus Scrimm) explains that when \\"God breathed life into the universe‚Ä¶the light gave birth to Angels‚Ä¶the earth gave birth to man...the fire gave birth to the djinn, creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds.\\" If a person wakes a djinn they will receive three wishes, but the third wish will free legions of djinn on Earth. In 1127, the djinn (Andrew Divoff) asks a Persian emperor to make his second wish. When the emperor wishes to see wonders, the djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. The emperor is horrified, but the djinn tells him to use his third wish to set things right. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster (Ari Barak), a sorcerer, explains the consequences of the third wish and reveals a fire opal, which pulls the djinn inside and traps him. In present-day America, Raymond Beaumont (Robert Englund) supervises workers lowering a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship. The crane operator Mickey Torelli (Joseph Pilato) is drunk and drops the box, killing Beaumont's assistant Ed Finley (Ted Raimi) and destroying the statue. A dockworker steals the fire opal from the rubble and pawns it. Eventually the jewel reaches Regal Auctioneers, where Nick Merritt (Chris Lemmon) instructs appraiser Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Amberson (Tammy Lauren) to examine it, which wakes the djinn. Alex sees something inside the jewel and leaves it with her close friend and colleague, Josh Aickman (Tony Crane), to analyze. As he is collecting data, the gem explodes, destroying the lab and releasing the djinn. Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, having been informed of Josh‚Äôs death by Lieutenant Nathanson (Ricco Ross), tracks the gem to the statue which she tracks to Beaumont, who sends Alex to visit Wendy Derleth (Jenny O'Hara), a folklore professor, who explains the history of the gem and the nature of the djinn: the djinn grants wishes in exchange for souls, but the wishes are granted in a way that makes them have undesirable results upon the wisher. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with human souls and then grant her three wishes before he can open the gateway to release his fellow djinn on Earth; meanwhile, the djinn takes the form of a dead man and uses the name Nathaniel Demerest. He kills a pharmacist (Reggie Bannister) with the wish of a vengeful vagrant (George 'Buck' Flower) and grants clerk Ariella‚Äôs (Gretchen Palmer) wish for eternal beauty by turning her into a mannequin. Searching for Alex, he goes to Nathanson to gain her file; however, Nathanson refuses to help him, though the djinn grants Nathanson‚Äôs wish to easily prove a criminal‚Äôs guilt by having the criminal go on a shooting spree inside the police precinct. He next visits Nick, killing a security guard (Kane Hodder) along the way, acquiring Nick‚Äôs cooperation by offering him a million dollars. Nick is given the money when his mother is killed in a plane crash. Alex sees troubling visions of every time the djinn grants wishes. She consults Derleth, but realizes that she is talking to the djinn, who has killed Derleth and taken her form. The djinn confronts Alex and offers her three wishes, as well an extra \\"test\\" wish, which she uses by ordering the djinn to kill itself. He shoots himself in the head with a gun but his wound heals instantly, revealing the djinn is an immortal. Using the first of the official three wishes, Alex wishes to know what he is. The Djinn teleports her to his hellish world within the gem which terrifies her as he boasts his evil to her. She wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, Shannon (Wendy Benson), so Alex hurries to a party Beaumont invited them to earlier. The djinn follows, again disguised as Nathaniel Demerest. Alex tells doorman Johnny Valentine (Tony Todd) to hold the djinn, as he is trying to kill her, and Valentine holds the djinn back; however, the djinn manipulates Valentine into making a wish, allowing the djinn to drown Valentine in a Chinese water torture cell, making his way into the party. The djinn charms Beaumont, who wishes his party would be unforgettable, and thus the djinn causes artwork to kill Beaumont, the guests, and the security guards called in to help. Eventually the djinn corners the sisters and attempts to scare Alex into making her third wish by trapping Shannon in a burning painting. Alex wishes that Torelli had not been drunk at work, undoing the events that followed and trapping the djinn in the fire opal again. The now sober Torelli lowers the crate with no problems. Alex visits Josh‚Äînow alive again‚Äîwho notices that Alex seems pleased with herself, though she does not explain why. Inside the jewel on the statue of Ahura Mazda‚Äînow in Beaumont's private collection‚Äîthe djinn sits on a throne, waiting to be released.

Robert Englund, who was Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, played an antique collector and Kane Hodder, who played Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th series, played a security guard. Also in the film were Tony Todd from Candyman, Ted Raimi from Candyman, Darkman, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, Ricco Ross from Aliens, Joseph Pilato from Day of the Dead, Reggie Bannister and the voice of Angus Scrimm (both of the Phantasm films), Jenny O'Hara from the later Devil, Jack Lemmon's son Chris Lemmon from Just Before Dawn and George 'Buck' Flower (who was often used in small parts in various horror movies of the 1980s and early 1990s, often directed by John Carpenter). Verne Troyer of later Austin Powers fame appears as the smaller Wishmaster when he first escapes from his gem prison. A Pazuzu statue, a personification of the demonic figure which possessed Linda Blair's character in The Exorcist series, also appeared. This can be seen in Beaumont's collection room and on display during the party scene where it attacks some of the guests, though it is not formally referenced. A veiled reference to the Cthulhu Mythos can be heard in the incantation used to imprison the Djinn; the words \\"Nib Shuggurath\\", a spoonerism of Shub-Niggurath. Makeup artist Tom Savini also appears in a cameo as a customer at the pharmacy when Reggie Bannister's character dies. Many crew members, including director Robert Kurtzman (man killed by piano), had small cameos in the film. Writing Writer Peter Atkins, also known for his work on Hellraiser films, intentionally made some surnames of characters in the film (Beaumont, Finney, Etchison, Clegg, Derleth, Merritt and Aickman) match the names of writers of horror and fantasy fiction. Josh Aickman (played by Tony Crane), explains to Alexandra Amberson (played by Tammy Lauren) that he can't test the opal immediately because he has, \\"...about 2 hours' worth of Professor Leiber's bullshit to take care of first.\\" This Professor does not make an appearance in the film and is not listed in the credits but is a reference to horror, fantasy, science fiction writer Fritz Leiber. Reception=Box office Wishmaster was shot on an estimated budget of US$5 million and its total domestic gross was US$15,738,769. During its opening weekend in theaters, 19‚Äì21 September 1997, Wishmaster made US $6,000,000, putting it in third place at the box office, behind In & Out (which was debuting in first place) and The Game (which was in second place during its second week). Critical response The film was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 28% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 3.93/10. Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle called it \\"an extravaganza of bad special effects and worse acting\\". Of the few positive reviews, The Times of Northwest Indiana critic Christopher Sheid gave it a B+ and stated that \\"Considering that the djinn itself is essentially a combination of Pinhead and Freddy, it's safe to say \\"Wishmaster\\" is a movie respectful of its influences. It's also respectful of its audience's intelligence, which is to say this shocker doesn't bore us with the pretense of trying to be smart... You couldn't wish for a better low-budget fright flick.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1997 films Category:1997 horror films Category:1990s fantasy films Category:1997 independent films Category:1990s supernatural films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Harry Manfredini Category:Films about wish fulfillment Category:Films directed by Robert Kurtzman Category:Films set in Iran Category:Genies in film Category:Artisan Entertainment films Category:Lionsgate franchises Category:Wishmaster films ","title":"Wishmaster (film)"},{"id":"456960","text":"Arms of Fox-Strangways: Quarterly of four: 1st & 4th: Sable, two lions passant paly of six argent and gules (Strangways); 2nd & 3rd: Ermine, on a chevron azure three fox's heads and necks erased or on a canton of the second a fleur- de-lys of the third (Fox)Montague-Smith, P.W.

It was created in 1756 for Stephen Fox, 1st Baron Ilchester, who had previously represented Shaftesbury in Parliament. He had already been created Baron Ilchester, of Ilchester in the County of Somerset in 1741, and Baron Ilchester and Stavordale, of Redlynch, in the County of Somerset, in 1747. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. All three peerages were created with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his younger brother Henry Fox, who was himself created Baron Holland in 1763. The brothers were the only sons from the second marriage of the politician Sir Stephen Fox. In 1758 the first Earl assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Strangways, which was the maiden name of his wife's maternal grandmother. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Midhurst in Parliament. His eldest son, the third Earl, served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1835 to 1841 in the Whig administration of Lord Melbourne and was also Lord Lieutenant of Somerset from 1837 to 1839. Lord Ilchester survived both his sons and was succeeded by his half-brother, the fourth Earl. He was Ambassador to the German Confederation from 1840 to 1849. His nephew, the fifth Earl, was Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms from 1873 to 1874 in the Liberal government of William Ewart Gladstone and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Dorset from 1885 to 1905. On the death in 1964 of his grandson, the seventh Earl, the line of the eldest son of the first Earl failed. The seventh Earl was succeeded by his fourth cousin, the eighth Earl. the titles are held by his grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded his uncle in 2006. The family seat was Melbury House, near Evershot, Dorset. The family, through Ilchester Estates, owns and manages large portions of land in the county of Devon and the Holland House estate west of Holland Park in Kensington, London. The family inherited much land in the 17th century from the Wadham family of Merryfield, Ilton in Somerset and of Edge, Branscombe in Devon, and in 1874 from their distant cousins the Fox family of Holland House, Kensington.

Earl De La Warr is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1761 for John West, 7th Baron De La Warr. The Earl holds the subsidiary titles of Viscount Cantelupe (1761) in the Peerage of Great Britain, Baron De La Warr (1572) in the Peerage of England, and Baron Buckhurst, of Buckhurst in the County of Sussex (1864) in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The barony De La Warr is of the second creation; however, it bears the precedence of the first creation, 1299, and has done so since shortly after the death of William West, 1st Baron De La Warr. The family seat is Buckhurst Park, near Withyham, Sussex. Etymology The name de La Warr is from Sussex and of Anglo-French origin. It came maybe from La Guerre, a Norman lieu-dit. This toponymic could derive from the Latin word ager, from the Breton gwern or from the Late Latin ' (fallow). The toponyms Gara, Gaire also appear in old texts cited by Lucien Musset, where the word ga(i)ra means gore. It could also be linked with a patronymic from the Old Norse verr. The barony and earldom are both pronounced \\"De La Ware\\", as in the American state of Delaware.Debrett's Peerage 1968, p.333Pronounced as \\"Delaware\\". Baronies of De La Warr The barony De La Warr is of the second creation; however, it bears the precedence of the first creation, 1299, and has done so since shortly after the death of William West, 1st Baron De La Warr. The precise legal situation concerning the second creation is murky. The modern rules attempt to regularize medieval practice, but there are many cases that cannot easily be made to fit, whether because a local custom was involved, or because an exception was made, or because the rules were still in flux. This is such a case, because William West was heir male but not heir general. Because the original barony was created by writ, descent is presumed to be to the heir (or heirs) general, and therefore it fell into abeyance between the daughters of Sir Owen West (and their heirs in turn). The second creation has been viewed in at least three ways: * As a means of placing beyond dispute an inheritance that should have gone to the heir male in the first place. The act concerning precedence is understood as rectifying the side effect this had of altering the precedence. Accordingly, some writers ignore the second creation when numbering: thus Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, is sometimes called the 12th Baron De La Warr. * As an extraordinary act resolving an important estate that should not be left in abeyance. In this case, the previous barony was intended to be extinguished and the act altering precedence is difficult to understand other than as political expediency. * As a part of an effort to solve relatively complex problems of inheritance case by case, before the doctrine of abeyance (as it now exists) had been worked out. Connection to American geographical names In United States history books, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr is often named simply as \\"Lord Delaware\\". He served as governor of the Jamestown Colony in Virginia, and the Delaware Bay was named after him. The state of Delaware, the Delaware River, and the Delaware Indian tribe were so called after the bay, and thus ultimately derive their names from the barony. Many other American counties, townships, and the like derive their names directly or indirectly from this connection. Other family members Notable descendants of George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr include the authors Lady Margaret Sackville, Vita Sackville-West, and Nigel Nicolson. Another member of the West family was William Cornwallis-West, who was the grandson of the Hon. Frederick West, youngest son of the second Earl. Cornwallis-West was the father of George Cornwallis-West, Daisy, Princess of Pless, and Constance, Duchess of Westminster.

It was first created in the Peerage of England in 1679 for John Robartes, 2nd Baron Robartes, a notable political figure of the reign of Charles II. He was made Viscount Bodmin at the same time. Robartes was the son of Richard Robartes, who had been created Baronet in July 1621George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage Volume 1 1900. and Baron Robartes, of Truro, in the Peerage of England in 1626. All three titles became extinct on the death of the fourth Earl in 1757. Anna Maria Hunt, great-niece of the fourth Earl, married the Hon. Charles Bagenal-Agar, youngest son of James Agar, 1st Viscount Clifden of Gowran. Their son Thomas James Agar-Robartes was created Baron Robartes in 1869. For more information on this title, see the Viscount Clifden. The earldom was created for a second time in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1765 when William Bouverie, 2nd Viscount Folkestone, was made Earl of Radnor. The Bouverie family descends from William des Bouverie, a prominent London merchant. He was created a baronet, of St Catherine Cree Church, London, in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1714. His eldest son, the second Baronet, represented Shaftesbury in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baronet. He sat as Member of Parliament for Salisbury until he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Longford and Viscount Folkestone in 1747. His son, the second Viscount, also represented Salisbury in Parliament. In 1765 he was made Baron Pleydell- Bouverie, of Coleshill in the County of Berkshire, and Earl of Radnor. The earldom was created with remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to the heirs male of his father. Both peerages were in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was Member of Parliament for Salisbury and served as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire. The second Earl assumed the additional surname of Pleydell after succeeding to the estates of his maternal grandfather, Sir Mark Stuart Pleydell, 1st Baronet (see Pleydell Baronets). His son, the third Earl, represented Downton and Salisbury in the House of Commons. On his death the titles passed to his son, the fourth Earl. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for South Wiltshire and Enfield and held political office as Treasurer of the Household from 1885 to 1886 under Lord Salisbury. His son, the sixth Earl, represented Wilton (also known as South Wiltshire) in Parliament as a Conservative and served as Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire. He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Earl. He notably held the honorary posts of Keeper of the Privy Seal and Lord Warden of the Stannaries and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1962. As of 2009 the titles are held by his grandson, also William Pleydell-Bouverie, the 9th Earl of Radnor, who succeeded his father in 2008. Successive Earls of Radnor were governors of the French Hospital from the eighteenth century to 2015.Incorporated in 1718, the hospital founded in Finsbury for poor French Protestants and their descendants, moved to a purpose-built hospital designed by Roumieu in Victoria Park, Hackney, then to Compton's Lea, Horsham, West Sussex and is now located in Rochester, Kent. Today it provides sheltered housing for people of Huguenot descent.

The medieval English word was Botehurst, thought to date at least from 13th century. Bote is the origination of Battle, although the family may have settled there post-dating the Conquest. This translated as 'a wood in a wood' which may in contradistinction have meant a clearing. The name of Apsley adopted by the family derived from Thakenham, near Pulborough in east Sussex, which may have referred to apse - lea or a 'church in a meadow'. The Bathurst estates were at Cirencester Park and Paulerspury, Northamptonshire, which Bathursts inherited before the park was laid out in the Cotswolds. History The title was created in 1772 for Allen Bathurst, 1st Baron Bathurst. He was a politician and an opponent of Sir Robert Walpole. He was also known for his wit and learning, for his connections with poets and scholars of his time, and the famous landscape garden he created at his seat, Cirencester House, in Gloucestershire. Sixty years before being created a Baron , in 1712, he had been elevated to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Bathurst, of Battlesden in the County of Bedford. Bathurst was the son of Sir Benjamin Bathurst, Cofferer of the Household and Governor of the British East India Company, by his wife Frances, daughter of Sir Allen Apsley. He married his cousin Catherine Apsley, daughter of his maternal uncle Sir Peter Apsley, in 1704. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the second Earl. He was a prominent lawyer and politician. In 1771, four years before the death of his father, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in his own right as Baron Apsley, in the County of Sussex. He then served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain until 1778 and later held office as Lord President of the Council. Bathurst constructed Apsley House in London, which later became the seat of the Dukes of Wellington. His eldest son Henry, the third Earl, was a noted politician. He served as President of the Board of Trade, as Foreign Secretary, as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies and as Lord President of the Council. He gave his name to Bathurst, the capital of The Gambia, now called Banjul; to the Australian town of Bathurst, the first inland city in the country; and to Bathurst Street, a major street in Toronto in Canada. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, represented Weobley and Cirencester in the House of Commons as a Tory. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Weobly. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the sixth Earl. He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. Thomas Seymour Bathurst, third and youngest son of the third Earl. Lord Bathurst represented Cirencester in Parliament as a Conservative. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the seventh Earl. He was for some years the owner of the Morning Post. Lord Bathurst's eldest son and heir apparent Allen Bathurst, Lord Apsley, was Member of Parliament for Southampton and Bristol Central. In 1942 he was killed in the Second World War, predeceasing his father by one year. His wife Viola Bathurst, Lady Apsley, succeeded him as Member of Parliament for Bristol Central. Lord Bathurst was succeeded by his grandson, the eighth Earl, who held political office under Harold Macmillan as a Lord- in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1957 to 1961 and as Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1961 to 1962. the titles are held by his son, the ninth Earl, who succeeded in 2011.

Benjamin Bathurst, younger son of the second Earl, was a diplomat best known for his sudden disappearance in 1809. The politician Charles Bathurst (who was born Charles Bragge and assumed the surname of Bathurst in 1804), was the son of Anne Bathurst, granddaughter of Sir Benjamin Bathurst, younger brother of the first Earl Bathurst.

History The titles Earl of Mansfield in the County of Nottingham and Earl of Mansfield in the County of Middlesex were created in 1776 and 1792, respectively, for the Scottish lawyer and judge William Murray, 1st Baron Mansfield, fourth son of David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont (see Viscount of Stormont for the earlier history of the family). He was Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench from 1756 to 1788. Murray had already been created Baron Mansfield, in the County of Nottingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1756, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. The two earldoms were created with different remainders. The 1776 earldom was created with remainder to Louisa Murray (n√©e Cathcart), Viscountess Stormont (daughter of Charles Schaw Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart), second wife of his nephew David Murray, 7th Viscount of Stormont, while the 1792 earldom, referring to a fictitious Mansfield in Middlesex to differentiate it from the first earldom,The Complete Peerage, vol. viii, p. 388, footnote (d) was created with remainder to his nephew the Viscount of Stormont. Lord Mansfield was childless and on his death in 1793, the barony became extinct. He was succeeded in the 1776 earldom according to the special remainder by his nephew's wife Louisa, the second Countess, and in the 1792 earldom according to the special remainder by his nephew Lord Stormont, who became the second Earl. The latter was a noted politician in his own right and served as Lord Justice General, Secretary of State for the Northern Department and Lord President of the Council. He was succeeded by his and the Countess of Mansfield's son, the third Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire. On his death, the title passed to his son, the fourth Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was a Tory politician and served as a Lord of the Treasury from 1834 to 1835 in the first administration of Sir Robert Peel. In 1843, he succeeded his grandmother the Countess of Mansfield (who had outlived her husband by forty-seven years) and became in addition the third Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation. He was succeeded by his grandson, the fifth and fourth Earl. He was the eldest son of William David Murray, Viscount of Stormont. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth and fifth Earl. His son, the seventh and sixth Earl, represented Perth in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Perthshire. The eighth and seventh Earl of Mansfield held office in the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher as a Minister of State at the Scottish Office from 1979 to 1983, and at the Northern Ireland Office from 1983 to 1984. The titles are presently held by his elder son, the ninth Earl of Mansfield of the 1792 creation and the eighth Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation. He is also the fifteenth Viscount of Stormont, the fifteenth Lord Scone and the thirteenth Lord Balvaird. The family seat is Scone Palace, near Scone, Perthshire.

History The Earls Fortescue descend from Sir Hugh Fortescue (1665‚Äì1719) of Filleigh and of Weare Giffard, both in Devon, whose first wife's first cousin had been 13th Baron Clinton and 5th Earl of Lincoln. In 1721 the abeyance of the ancient barony of Clinton was terminated in favour of his son Hugh Fortescue (1696‚Äì1751), who thus became the 14th Baron Clinton. On 5 July 1746, he was created Earl Clinton, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body and Baron Fortescue, of Castle Hill in the County of Devon, with special remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to his half-brother Matthew Fortescue. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Clinton (1696‚Äì1751), had no legitimate children and thus on his death the barony of Clinton fell into abeyance (see Baron Clinton for later history of this title) while the earldom of Clinton became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of Fortescue (according to the special remainder) by his half-brother Matthew Fortescue, 2nd Baron Fortescue. Matthew's son Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Baron Fortescue (1753‚Äì1841), was a Member of Parliament for Beaumaris and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Devon. In 1789 he was created Viscount Ebrington, of Ebrington in the County of Gloucester, and Earl Fortescue, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He married Hester Grenville, a daughter of Prime Minister George Grenville. He was succeeded by his eldest son Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue (1783‚Äì1861), who was a prominent Whig politician. After representing several constituencies in the House of Commons he was summoned in 1839 to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Fortescue. He then served under Lord Melbourne as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1839 to 1841 and under Lord John Russell as Lord Steward of the Household from 1846 to 1850. His son Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Earl Fortescue (1818‚Äì1905), was also a Whig politician and held minor office from 1846 to 1851 in the same government as his father. In 1859 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Fortescue. His eldest son Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue (1854‚Äì1932), sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Tiverton and for Tavistock. He also held the honorary position of Lord-Lieutenant of Devon. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue (1888‚Äì1958), a Conservative politician who served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (Chief Government Whip in the House of Lords) in 1945 and from 1951 to 1958. He died without surviving male issue and (having bequeathed the two principle ancestral seats of Castle Hill, Filleigh, and Weare Giffard Hall, to his two daughters), was succeeded in the earldom by his third and youngest brother Denzil Fortescue, 6th Earl Fortescue (1893‚Äì1977), who inherited the ancient Fortescue seat of Ebrington Manor in Gloucestersire. He was succeeded by his eldest son Richard Fortescue, 7th Earl Fortescue (1922‚Äì1993), who was succeeded by his eldest son Charles Fortescue, 8th Earl Fortescue (born 1951), living in 2015.Kidd, Charles, Debrett's peerage & Baronetage 2015 Edition, London, 2015, p.P472 Several other members of the Fortescue family may also be mentioned. The Hon. George Matthew Fortescue, second son of the first Earl, was Member of Parliament for Hindon. The Hon. John Fortescue, second son of the second Earl, was Member of Parliament for Barnstaple. The Hon. Dudley Fortescue, third son of the second Earl, was Member of Parliament for Andover. The Hon. Sir Seymour John Fortescue (1856‚Äì1942), second son of the third Earl, was a Captain in the Royal Navy and also served as Serjeant at Arms in the House of Lords. The Hon. Arthur Grenville Fortescue (1858‚Äì1895), fourth son of the third Earl, was a captain in the army and the grandfather of Arthur Henry Grenville Fortescue, a brigadier in the army. The Hon. Sir John William Fortescue, fifth son of the third Earl, was a major in the army and writer on the British Army. The Hon. Charles Grenville Fortescue (1861‚Äì1951), sixth son of the third Earl, was a brigadier-general in the army. Seats The principal seat of the present Earl Fortescue is Ebrington Manor, near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, purchased by his distant ancestor Sir John Fortescue (c.1394-1479), Chief Justice of the King's Bench, a younger grandson of the Fortescue family of Whympston in the parish of Modbury in Devon, the earliest Fortescue seat in England. The more grandiose former seat Castle Hill, Filleigh, North Devon, rebuilt as a Palladian mansion by Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Clinton (1696‚Äì1751), has been since the death of the 5th Earl in 1958, the property and residence of descendants in the female line. Other historic Devon seats of branches of the Fortescue family were: Whympston in the parish of Modbury; Weare Giffard; Buckland Filleigh; Preston; Spriddlestone in the parish of Brixton and Fallapit in the parish of East Allington, all in Devon.Vivian, Heraldic Visitations of Devon, 1895, pp. 352-367 Barons Fortescue (1746) * Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Clinton, 1st Baron Fortescue, 14th Baron Clinton (1696‚Äì1751) * Matthew Fortescue, 2nd Baron Fortescue (1719‚Äì1785), half- brother; * Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Baron Fortescue (1753‚Äì1841), son, created Earl Fortescue in 1789 Earls Fortescue (1789) * Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Fortescue (1753‚Äì1841) * Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue (1783‚Äì1861) * Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Earl Fortescue (1818‚Äì1905) * Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue (1854‚Äì1932) * Hugh William Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue (1888‚Äì1958) * Denzil George Fortescue, 6th Earl Fortescue (1893‚Äì1977) * Richard Archibald Fortescue, 7th Earl Fortescue (1922‚Äì1993) * Charles Hugh Richard Fortescue, 8th Earl Fortescue (born 1951) The heir presumptive is the present holder's first cousin John Andrew Francis Fortescue (born 1955).

The current holder is George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon. The town and county in Wales to which the title refers are historically spelled Caernarfon, having been Anglicised to Carnarvon or Caernarvon. The traditional Welsh spelling is itself a modified form of the original name of antiquity, Caer-yn-Arfon, meaning fortification opposite the island of Mona (now Anglesey). History The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1628 in favour of Robert Dormer, 2nd Baron Dormer of Wyng. For more information on this creation, which became extinct in 1709, see the Baron Dormer. The second creation was in 1714 in the Peerage of Great Britain for James Brydges, 9th Baron Chandos. In 1719 he was further honoured when he was made Marquess of Carnarvon and Duke of Chandos. For more information on this creation, which became extinct in 1789, see the Duke of Chandos. The third creation was in 1793 in the Peerage of Great Britain for Henry Herbert, 1st Baron Porchester. The precise form of this creation was Earl of the Town and County of Carnarvon, in the Principality of Wales, although in practice only the style of Earl of Carnarvon is used. He had previously represented Wilton in the House of Commons and had already in 1780 been created Baron Porchester, of High Clere in the County of Southampton (also in the Peerage of Great Britain). Herbert was the son of Major-General the Hon. William Herbert, fifth son of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke. He was succeeded by his eldest son Henry George Herbert, the second Earl, who sat as Whig Member of Parliament for Cricklade. His eldest son Henry John George Herbert, the third Earl, briefly represented Wootton Bassett in Parliament as a Tory before he succeeded his father in the earldom. His eldest son Henry Howard Molyneux Herbert, the fourth Earl, was a prominent Conservative politician and served as Secretary of State for the Colonies and as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was succeeded by his only son from his first marriage, George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, who is noted for discovering the tomb of Tutankhamun along with Howard Carter. , the titles are held by the fifth earl's great-grandson, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 2001. As a male line descendant of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke and 5th Earl of Montgomery, he is also in remainder to these peerages and their subsidiary titles. Several other members of this branch of the Herbert family may be mentioned. The Very Reverend the Hon. William Herbert, third son of the first Earl, was a clergyman and noted botanist. His son Henry William Herbert was a novelist and writer on sport. Sir Robert George Wyndham Herbert, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1871 to 1892, was the son of the Hon. Algernon Herbert, fifth son of the first Earl. The Hon. Auberon Herbert, second son of the third Earl, was a writer, theorist, and philosopher, and also represented Nottingham in the House of Commons. He married Lady Florence Amabel Cowper, daughter of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper and his wife Lady Anne Florence de Grey Cowper, 7th Baroness Lucas of Crudwell. In 1905, their only son Auberon Herbert succeeded his uncle as ninth Baron Lucas of Crudwell (see this title for further history of this branch of the family). The Hon. Aubrey Herbert, second son of the fourth Earl, was Member of Parliament for South Somerset and for Yeovil. His son Auberon Herbert was an expert on Eastern Europe. The family seat of the Herbert Earls of Carnarvon is Highclere Castle in Hampshire, which was the setting for the UK television series Downton Abbey.

This act was established as a United States National policy to preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, restore or enhance, the resources of the Nation's coastal zone for this and succeeding generations. History The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972 showed that the United States Congress ‚Äúrecognized the importance of meeting the challenge of continued growth in the coastal zone‚Äù. Under this act two national programs were created, the National Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. Out of 35 eligible states, only 34 have established management programs; Washington State was the first state to adopt the program in 1976. The Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP), also called the National Coastal Zone Management Program, was established under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 and is administered by NOAA‚Äôs Office for Coastal Management (OCM). This program is designed to set up a basis for protecting, restoring, and establishing a responsibility in preserving and developing the nation‚Äôs coastal communities and resources, where they are under the highest pressure. The vision of the CZMP is to ensure that ‚Äúthe nation‚Äôs coast and oceans, including the Great Lakes and island territories, are healthy and thriving for this and future generation‚Äù. Their mission is ‚Äúto ensure the conservation and responsible use of our nation‚Äôs coastal and ocean resources‚Äù.https://coast.noaa.gov/czm/media/CZMA_10_11_06.pdf The key goals of the National CZM program include: ‚Äúprotecting natural resources, managing development in high hazard areas, giving development priority to coastal- dependent uses, providing public access for recreation, coordinating state and federal actions‚Äù. Ultimately the outcomes from the CZMP are for ‚Äúhealthy and productive coastal ecosystems, and to have environmentally, economically, and socially vibrant and resilient coastal communities‚Äù. The National Estuarine Research Reserve System is the second programs established by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 and is also administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NERRS is a network of 28 areas within the nation and various coastal states, which spans more than 1 million acres. These areas are used for long-term research, water-quality monitoring, education, and coastal stewardship. Components Title 16 Chapter 33- Coastal Zone Management Act * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1451. Congressional findings Congress found a national interest for the management protection and use of coastal zones. Coastal zones are valuable to the nation's current and future prosperity for their \\"natural, commercial, recreational, ecological, industrial, and esthetic resources.\\" Many stresses are on the lands of coastal zone, from natural, residential, and industry and there is need to preserve and protect these areas. Some of the ecosystems are threatened by man, if lands aren‚Äôt preserved and protected all beneficial use can be lost forever. ‚ÄúIn light of competing demands and the urgent need to protect and to give high priority to natural systems in the coastal zone‚Ä¶‚Äù Also, due to potential for global warming these areas need to be prepared for any alterations in water levels. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1452. Congressional declaration of policy Congress declares in its national policy ‚Äúto preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance, the resources of the Nation's coastal zone for this and succeeding generations.‚Äù https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/coastal_zone_management_act_of_1972 This is encouraged through the various states and coastal regions that want to actively participate in local, Federal, and State programs. These programs need to be aware of changes affecting the coastal areas and know how to act in response. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1453. Definitions A ‚Äúcoastal zone\\" is defined as the ‚Äúcoastal waters and the adjacent shorelands, as well as includes islands, transitional and intertidal areas, salt marshes, wetlands, and beaches.‚Äù * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1454. Management program development grants These are awarded to coastal states that have developed a management program which has been approved through the Secretary. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1455. Administrative grants Funds will be awarded through the Secretary to coastal states that establish management programs. States must identify clear boundaries for the coastal zone they wish to monitor and preserve, as well as define the lands subject to management. The State will conduct public hearings for the development of the program. The Governor of the State must also review and approve any changes to the program. Also the State has to ensure a method of regulation for local land and water usage within the defined areas. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1455a. Coastal resource improvement program The Secretary can award grants to a coastal state to help that state meet such requirement as the preservation or restoration of areas designated under the program or that have coastal resources of national significance. This also means to establish public beaches as well as more public coastal regions and waters. Funding can be used to acquire more lands, and low-cost construction such as fences, parks, and paths. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1455b. Protecting coastal waters Programs established, or applying for establishment, must give a general purpose for the land uses of the coastal zone. The state must include the critical coastal areas of the set region, establish management procedures, and technical assistance resources. The state needs to identify how it will be engaging public participation, for a community effort, this includes public hearings and the right for public education. States will demonstrate how they will establish coordination amongst local government bodies, state, and federal, and as how the potential boundary modification of the zone will affect the program. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1456. Coordination and cooperation If other Federal agencies are interested in the program, the Secretary is responsible for coordination of their set activities with this body. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1456-1. Authorization of the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program Under the Coastal Zone Management Program and the National Estuarine Reserve System, appropriate cooperation with local agencies, State and other agency will provide the means for protecting these zones. This is to preserve areas that have importance regarding ‚Äúrecreation, ecological, historical, or aesthetic values, or that are threatened by conversion from their natural, undeveloped, or recreational state.‚Äù The National Ocean Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management will administer the programs * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1456a. Coastal Zone Management Fund * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1456b. Coastal Zone Enhancement Grants Grants will be subject to the limitations of the goals of coastal zone enhancement objectives. This means that the state will aim toward either the protection, restoration or the enhancement of the coastal zone or for the creation of new wetlands. This also includes, protecting and reducing threats to the environment and managing potential hazards; the areas should include public access venues pertaining to aesthetic, historical, or cultural value; and management and prevention of debris. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1456c. Technical assistance A network will be established by the Secretary to support the development and implementation of the coastal management program into the State. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1457. Public hearings Hearings will be announced 30 days in advance and will provide documentation of studies and data available for public viewing. This is similar to the effect as documentation of data will be available for public viewing as the agency becomes aware of it. * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1458. Review of performance * 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1459.

Combined, the 2011 award totaled over $65 million which supports a \\"variety of coastal management projects.\\" Coastal Zone Management Program The four types of funding relevant to the Coastal Zone Management Programs are: 1\\\\. Administrative Grants OCM provides matching funds to states for CZMP (1:1). 2\\\\. Coastal Resource Improvement Program States may spend half of their Section 306 funds on small-scale construction or land acquisition projects, this is geared to improve ‚Äúpublic access to the coast, facilitate redevelopment of urban waterfronts, or preserve and restore coastal resources.‚Äù 3\\\\. Coastal Zone Enhancement Grants Per Section 309, OCM provides zero match funds to state coastal zone management programs, beneficial for enhancement of the states program 4\\\\. Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (Technical Assistance) Congress matches funds to that of the States established program (1:1). National Estuarine Reserve System Under Section 315, the OCM provides funding to the 28 state National Estuarine Research Reserves. Funding is used for support of research, land acquisition matched (1:1), construction, education, monitoring, and graduate research fellowships.

He was recalled to Addis Ababa from Asmara to serve on the military tribunal, which tried the high-ranking officers who had tried to depose President Mengistu in 1989 following the decisive defeat at the Battle of Shire. He was appointed as Vice President and minister of defense of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in April 1991. He became acting president on 21 May 1991 when Mengistu fled as Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) forces closed in on the capital. Tesfaye took over a regime in a state of utter collapse. He only ruled for a week before the EPRDF marched into Addis Ababa and seized power on 27 May 1991. \\"Government troops turned on one another,\\" read one contemporary account. \\"Soldiers wantonly looted state property.\\" Tesfaye informed the U.S. charg√© d'affaires in Addis Ababa that he could no longer control the situation, then after announcing a unilateral cease-fire he fled for the safety of the Italian Embassy.\\"Ethiopia: Rebels Take Charge\\", Time 10 June 1991 (accessed 14 May 2009). According to Paul B. Henze, Tesfaye had first sought sanctuary at the US embassy, but Ambassador Robert Houdek turned him away. (Layers of Time [New York: Palgrave, 2000], p. 332) The General remained a virtual prisoner in the Embassy. At the embassy he had a stroke and needed a wheelchair as a result. He constantly clashed with his colleague (and former Foreign Minister) Berhanu Bayeh by constantly accusing him of being an enemy sympathizer (because Berhanu's wife was of Eritrean origin). During a physical brawl with Berhanu, Tesfaye was accidentally hurt on his head from a glass cut and bled profusely. On 8 August 2004, he was taken to Menelik II Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Berhanu Bayeh had accompanied him into the Embassy 13 years earlier.

The national system of MPAs consists of the group of MPA sites, networks, and systems established and managed by federal, state, territorial, tribal and/or local governments that collectively enhance conservation of the nation's marine heritage and represent its diverse ecosystems and resources. Although managed independently, national system MPAs work together at the regional and national levels to achieve common objectives for conserving the nation's important natural and cultural resources. The national system does not bring state, territorial or local sites under federal authority, nor does it restrict or change the management of any MPA. Background Over the past century, MPAs have been created by a mix of federal, state, and local legislation, voter initiatives, and regulations, each established for its own specific purpose. As a result, the nation's collection of MPAs (e.g., reserves, refuges, preserves, sanctuaries, areas of special biological significance, and others) is fragmented, complex, confusing, and potentially missing opportunities for broader regional conservation through coordinated planning and management. In 2000, a broad coalition of scientists petitioned the White House to create a national system of MPAs to improve conservation of the nation's marine ecosystems, cultural resources, and fisheries. Presidential Executive Order 13158 was signed by President Bill Clinton on May 26, 2000, directing the Department of Commerce to work with the Department of the Interior, other federal agencies, states, territories, tribes and stakeholders to establish a national system of MPAs to integrate and enhance the nation's MPAs, bringing these diverse sites and programs together to work on common conservation objectives. MPAs protect ecosystems and resources such as coral reefs, kelp forests, shipwrecks, and those areas frequented by whales and other marine life. They also can provide protection to economically valuable coastal and marine resources including commercial and recreational fisheries. The national system includes MPAs throughout the marine environment of the U.S. and its territories, including coastal areas, estuaries, oceans and the Great Lakes. As a first step in developing the national system of MPAs, the MPA Center compiled an MPA Inventory of all MPAs in U.S. waters. The U.S. has over 1,600 MPAs, ranging from typically small fully protected marine reserves where extractive uses are prohibited to large, multiple-use areas where fishing, diving and other uses are permitted. Most MPAs in U.S. waters allow some type of extractive use, with less than 1% of U.S. waters fully protected marine reserves where extractive activities are not permitted. The national system is described in detail in the for a National System of Marine Protected Areas of the United States of America. In April 2009 the National System of Marine Protected Areas was officially established with the acceptance of the first 225 charter sites. A second nomination process was held in Fall 2009, and additional sites will be admitted to the system in 2010 on an annual basis thereafter. The nomination process is transparent, science-based, and provides an opportunity for public comment. The national system of MPAs provides the first comprehensive mechanism for coordinating MPAs managed by diverse federal, state, territorial, tribal and local agencies to work toward national conservation objectives. The system will benefit the nation's collective conservation efforts and participating MPAs, providing those sites with a means to address issues beyond their boundaries. Examples of some of these benefits include: *Enhanced stewardship through better coordination, public awareness and enhanced site management capacity *Building partnerships for MPAs to work together toward common conservation objectives *Increased support for marine conservation through the recognition provided by the national system *Protecting representative ecosystems and resources from all the nation's ecosystem and habitat types *Identifying gaps in current protection of ocean resources to help inform future MPA planning *Transparent process for MPA planning that is science-*based and includes a commitment to balanced stakeholder involvement.

It has a 658 cc (52 PS) multi-point fuel-injected four-cylinder engine (44 PS DIN was claimed in Europe for the same engine), which is small enough to place it in the light car class, giving its owners large tax breaks in Japan. There was also a carbureted version with in Japan, which equipped the Vivio Van version. The Vivio feels roomy considering its small size, thanks to a relatively tall profile and large windows. It is one of the lightest kei cars, weighing in at between and depending on the trim line. History The name \\"Vivio\\" is a reference to the engine's displacement of 660 written in Roman numerals (VI,VI,O), and also inspired by the word \\"vivid\\". It replaced the Rex that was introduced in the 1970s, and was itself superseded by the Subaru Pleo. It was available in 3 and 5-door versions commonly, with a two-door targa top version named T-top being available to special order from 1994. The T-top was built by Takada Kogyo, a convertible specialist who also assembled Nissan's Figaro and Silvia Varietta amongst other specialty cars. Subaru Vivio Bistro White Edition In November 1995 the Vivio Bistro was introduced. This was modified variation with a retro theme, with Mini-esque front and rear fascias, matching upholstery and modifications to the dashboard. The Bistro series was popular, causing Subaru to release multiple succeeding versions of the Bistro, called the \\"Bistro B-Custom\\", the \\"Bistro Chiffon\\", the \\"Bistro White Edition\\", the \\"L Bistro\\", the \\"Sports Bistro\\" with BBS wheels, the \\"Bistro SS\\" using the engine package from the Vivio RX-SS, and the \\"Club Bistro\\" with a British black cab appearance. The trend of retro-styled cars was quite popular in 1990s Japan, following the success of Nissan's \\"Pike\\" series cars like the Pao and Figaro. Subaru also tried this approach with the larger Subaru Impreza called the Casa Blanca with limited success. The Vivio was available with a variety of normally aspirated or supercharged four-cylinder engines with different gearbox options (including ECVT - an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission) and multiple trim packages. Aside from the top of the line RX-R, all engines were SOHC 8-valve designs. The ECVT equipped supercharged model claimed with such a setup, and while the Twin Cam 16-valve RX-R version claimed to make no more power than the SOHC, this was only to stay within the limitations laid down by Japan's kei car legislations. Claimed torque was higher, at versus . Front- or four-wheel drive version were offered. The suspension setup used was inspired by the Legacy instead of using strictly MacPherson struts to save on production costs. Motorsport Subaru Vivio in the 2002 Rally Hokkaido. The supercharged grade RX-R and RX-RA was widely used for rallying in Japan. RX-RA was a motorsports trim grade with more close ratio gears and harder suspensions than RX-R. Some entrants still enter Vivios at WRC Rally Japan. In 1992, at the Paris-Beijing marathon raid, a private entrant ran the Vivio RX-R with the EN07X engine. Most people who saw the car imagined its early retirement but was faster than works team Mitsubishi Pajero at the prologue stage, and ran for more than a week until it broke its suspension. The car made it to the finishing line unofficially after repairs were carried out, with no other serious troubles. The most famous appearance of Vivio in an international motorsport event was in the 1993 round of the Safari Rally under the decision of former factory driver and Subaru Technica International founder and team owner Noriyuki Koseki to promote the car.http://www.rallye-info.com/carmodel.asp?car=208 Subaru Vivio Details : Rallye-Info.com He made the decision to enter three of the sports model Vivio Super KK driven by Masashi Ishida, local driver Patrick Njiru and up and coming WRC star Colin McRae on his Safari debut. \\"Super KK\\" is the FIA homologation name for the RX-R grade, in rally trim the 660 cc engine produced at 6,000 rpm.

The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by Roncesvalles Avenue, on the north by the CP Rail line where it crosses Queen Street and Dundas Street. It is bounded on the east by Dufferin Street from Queen Street south, and on the south by Lake Ontario. The original village incorporated an area north of Queen Street, east of Roncesvalles from Fermanagh east to the main rail lines, today known as part of the Roncesvalles neighbourhood. The village area was roughly one square kilometre in area. The City of Toronto government extends the neighbourhood boundaries to the east, south of the CP Rail lines, east to Atlantic Avenue, as far south as the CN Rail lines north of Exhibition Place, the part south of King Street commonly known as the western half of Liberty Village neighbourhood. Parkdale was founded as an independent settlement within York County in the 1850s. It was incorporated as a village in 1879 and amalgamated with Toronto in 1889. It was an upper-income residential area for the first half of the 20th century, with several notable mansions. The area changed dramatically with the building of the Gardiner Expressway in 1955, which resulted in the demolition of the southern section of the neighbourhood and the Sunnyside Amusement Park, and the creation of a barrier between the neighbourhood and the north shore of Lake Ontario. A boom in apartment building construction followed, replacing whole blocks of homes with blocks of apartment buildings. Some of the older large residential buildings remain though many were converted into rooming houses. The demographic composition changed considerably, including a higher proportion of lower income and newcomer families. Today, it is a working-class neighbourhood, with a large percentage of low-income households concentrated in South Parkdale, and an entry point for new immigrants, most recently South Asians and Tibetan. The visible minority population in North Parkdale has changed overall to include fewer Asian, South Asian and Black residents between the census years 2006-2011 (GNR: 34%). The distribution, of said visible minorities, has changed from being predominantly Black visible minorities to predominantly South Asian (between 2006 and 2011 census). The area has a vibrant storefront commercial strip along Queen Street West that has seen an increase in restaurants and bars in the 2010s, increasing to the point that planning controls were put in place on the opening of new restaurants and bars from 2012.http://www.insidetoronto.com/news- story/4633839-parkdale-s-ban-on-new-restaurants-repealed-by-toronto-council/ Character Parkdale is primarily a residential area of the city, with semi- detached homes predominating on most side streets. Many of the homes date from the 19th Century and early 20th Century. Around 1900, the area was a well-to- do suburb and many older mansions from around 1900 still exist, often converted to multi-unit buildings. Many of the residential streets have mature trees. Good examples of Victorian housing can still be found on Cowan Avenue and Dunn Avenue, south of King Street. Victorian-era row homes of Georgian Revival style with original gaslights can also be seen on Melbourne Place. Victorian-era row homes may be found at Melbourne Place in Parkdale. Parkdale has a higher than average amount of rental housing. Several streets, notably Jameson Avenue and Tyndall Avenue have been converted to zones of apartment buildings. The apartment buildings mostly date from the 1950s through the 1970s, and have remained rental buildings while no large condominium projects have been built west of Dufferin Street. King Street and Queen Street West. Parkdale's commercial districts are along Queen Street West from Roncesvalles in the west to Dufferin Avenue in the east, and King Street West around Dufferin Street. Queen Street West has a large proportion of restaurants and bars, as well as local shops and art galleries. Commercial space is mostly storefronts oriented toward local customers. The area has a lower amount of park land per resident compared to other parts of Toronto. Several streets have parkettes built since the 1960s in an initiative to increase the amount of park land in the area. Demographically, Parkdale is mixed in income and ethnicity. The neighbourhood has an above average percentage of renters and that number has increased since 2006 to 2011. The area contains some of the lowest-income persons in the city. Between 2006 and 2011, there was a decrease in the median income of Parkdale by 2.9%.Census Data (2006, 2011). Statistics Canada However, in 2011, there was an increase in the number of people earning within the range of $30,000 to $60,000. The large amount of rental stock is an entry point for immigrants to Toronto. The area has a significant group of musicians and visual artists, who often perform and exhibit locally. To the south of Parkdale, the area is bordered by transportation uses, including the railway, Gardiner Expressway and Lake Shore Boulevard. South of the transportation corridor, the shoreline is mostly park land, with recreational clubs such as the Argonaut Rowing Club and Boulevard Club (formerly the Parkdale Canoe Club) on the water. History The Village of Parkdale was founded in 1879, but settlement of the area predated its foundation. In 1812, the of land bounded from Lot Street (today's Queen Street) on the north, and Jameson on the west and Dufferin Avenue was granted to James Brock, the cousin of Sir Isaac Brock, in lieu of salary. Brock did not occupy or improve the land during his lifetime. After Brock's death in 1830, his widow Lucy Brock sold the lands which became the major part of Parkdale to John Henry Dunn and William Gwynne. The area north of Queen Street was subdivided from the O'Hara Estate, given to Walter O'Hara for military service. Another parcel of land north of Queen was given to James Brock, east of the O'Hara estate, was developed along Brock Avenue and became Brockton Village. Parkdale railway station in 1898. The railway station opened in 1856. The Parkdale railway station was opened at Queen and Dufferin streets in 1856. In the 1870s, the Grand Trunk Railway built a railway station at Jameson Avenue, on its east‚Äìwest line. It was named South Parkdale, and the Queen Street station was given the name of North Parkdale station. A census of residents prior to the founding showed 783 residents of the area, more than enough for the legal requirement of 750 at the time. A local legend is that Gypsies were signed up as local residents to provide enough numbers. Parkdale's status as an independent village was controversial at the time and was opposed by the City of Toronto and the York County councils. City of Toronto a decade earlier, in 1888. It was purely a residential suburb, home to large Victorian mansions and views of Lake Ontario. The first house of worship in Parkdale, the Anglican Church of St. Mark, was completed on January 20, 1881, on Cowan Ave just south of Queen Street. In 1884, the Village council passed a bylaw to join Toronto, to be annexed by the City of Toronto, as the village was in fact surrounded by the city of Toronto. The act did not take place immediately as the Village's finances were not in order. Liabilities of the village were not clearly stated in the village's financial statements. On October 27, 1888, another vote was held and the annexation was upheld. The village was annexed by the City of Toronto in March 1889. It became \\"St. Alban's Ward.\\". In the 1910s, the South Parkdale station was closed and replaced with Sunnyside railway station. At the time, a cut was made between Dowling and Atlantic streets and the rail lines of the Grand Trunk were moved below street level. The North Parkdale stations were given new signage of \\"Parkdale\\", returning to the original name. 'Sunnyside years' Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Parkdale's desirability stemmed from its proximity to the lake, the Canadian National Exhibition to the south-east and the popular Sunnyside Beach at the foot of Roncesvalles to the west. From 1911 to 1922, the Toronto Harbour Commission improved the lakefront extending the shoreline from the rail line south, with a breakwater and boardwalk. As an example, in 1905, the Parkdale Canoe Club (known today as the Boulevard Club) opened. When built, it was on a pier extending out into the lake. As part of the infill project, it became situated inland. To the east of the current building were baseball and lacrosse fields. It was the site of a popular women's softball league for many years. Sunnyside Amusement Park was opened in 1922, providing a popular day vacation for Torontonians. Movie theatres were opened, such as the Brighton on Roncesvalles and the Odeon on Queen Street to the east of Roncesvalles. Hotels like the Edgewater at Queen and Roncesvalles were established. Opened in 1922, Palais Royale is located along Lake Shore Boulevard. The facility is situated near the edge of Sunnyside Beach. The Palais Royale at the eastern edge of Sunnyside Beach opened in 1922 as a canoe factory and dance hall. Many important big bands played there in the 1930s and the 1940s, and this attracted a large youth patronage. Many war-generation Torontonians courted their future partners in this building. The Palais Royale operates today as a special occasion hall and is a favourite venue for bands, including The Rolling Stones, who played a 2002 concert there, and has been the location for live recordings by Sloan and Downchild Blues Band. 1950s-1970s: Gardiner Expressway and urban changes In 1955, the city began work on the Gardiner Expressway, a limited access highway alongside the railway cut. The Sunnyside Amusement Park was demolished, except for the Bathing Pavilion and the Palais Royale hall. The southern section of Parkdale to the west of Dufferin, south of the railway was also demolished. Parkdale was now separated from Lake Ontario and Sunnyside Beach and the expressway effectively halved the amount of usable lakeside parkland. A reorganization of the area's residential streets was also done. Patronage of the beach declined rapidly. Both the Parkdale and Sunnyside train stations closed during the 1970s. The Gardiner Expressway is a controlled-access highway that runs east-west through Parkdale. The neighbourhood changed greatly with the completion of the highway. The neighbourhood changed greatly after the highway was completed and the park closed. Population density increased with the building of numerous apartment buildings. Jameson Avenue, which became the conduit to the highway changed from single family homes to a street of apartment buildings, many cheaply built. Nearby, many of the mansions and large houses became makeshift low-rise 'bachelorette' apartment buildings and rooming houses. Several had operated as tourist hotels for visitors to Sunnyside and the CNE. Industrial activity declined along the railways. One former industrial site on West Lodge Avenue became a two-tower apartment complex that has repeatedly been cited by the City for various by-law infractions. Businesses suffered during the transition, with leisure-type businesses compatible with the Park, such as the Brighton and Odeon theatres closing. Along Queen Street, which saw traffic decline substantially, many businesses closed or changed hands. 1970s: Absorption of out-patients In the mid-1970s, the Government of Ontario decided to release many long-term care mental illness patients from its Queen Street and Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital facilities to integrate them into the community. Many of the remaining mansions of South Parkdale had already been converted to boarding houses, and were only a short distance away from the Queen Street hospital. Many illegal 'bachelorette' units were also being created and the inexpensive rental stock of South Parkdale soon became home to many of the released patients. The area developed a reputation as a neighbourhood rife with poverty, crime, drugs, homelessness, and large numbers of people living with mental illness. In 1977, the Parkdale Activity- Recreation Centre (PARC) was founded to operate a drop-in centre in Parkdale for survivors of mental health ailments, the homeless, the disabled and those with few resources. Community volunteers observed that there were a large number of adults living in rooming houses and boarding homes throughout the Parkdale community after local mental health facilities began to de- institutionalize psychiatric patients. Most of these adults possessed little income, had few or no family contacts, did not have a place to go during the day and had been ostracized. In 1980 PARC found funding, staff and a venue and opened its doors to provide support, meals, employment opportunities and various programs to people with serious mental health and addiction issues. The Parkdale Village Business Improvement Area (BIA) was established in 1978, and represents the commercial strip on Queen Street West from Dufferin Street to Roncesvalles Avenue. The BIA has highlighted the uniqueness of this commercial district, including its restaurants, antique stores, caf√©s and shops. Recent Owing to the many affordable rental apartments and its proximity to the downtown core, Parkdale has evolved into a transient neighbourhood for many newcomers to Canada. Waves of Caribbean, Indian, Vietnamese, Filipino, Tamil, Chinese, Tibetan, Hungarian and Roma immigrants have marked Parkdale in different times between 1980 till present. Parkdale has, since the late 1990s, hosted a large number of Tibetan settlers, with the area known as Little Tibet becoming home to one of the largest Tibetan diaspora outside of India and Nepal. Parkdale has a number of settlement and immigration agencies that deal with the needs of the newcomers and provide them with the necessary support as they explore the opportunities provided in Canada. Some of the agencies are Parkdale Community Information Centre (PCIC), Parkdale Community Legal Services, PIA, and Culture Link. Parkdale is a mixed income neighbourhood, Some of the recent developments in Parkdale include the Healthy Organic Parkdale Edibles (HOPE) garden in the Masaryk Park, south of Queen and on the west side of Cowan Avenue. This community garden was founded by Shannon Thompson of Greenest City, along with many community members to allow residents who don't have growing space to grow food and build a more inclusive community area. The environmental and community organization based in Parkdale since 2006 works with food sovereignty, youth employment, environmental awareness and community building. Greenest City has also initiated the Youth Garden in Dunn Parkette. The volunteers of the two gardens also host festivals, workshops, field trips along with other activities and projects in the area. The area has seen an influx of artists working in the relatively inexpensive spaces, close to the exhibit spaces on Queen Street within Parkdale and along Queen Street to the east. The opening of the Parkdale Arts and Cultural Centre, along with efforts to promote businesses in the area, such as the Parkdale-Liberty Economic Development Centre, has spurred the growth of a vibrant creative area along Queen Street, which puts on a large display during Toronto's annual 'Nuit Blanche.' The housing stock has seen some gentrification, especially in the area north of Queen Street identified with the \\"Roncesvalles Village\\" area, again due to the relatively inexpensive property values. In recent years housing prices in Parkdale have caught up with much of the rest of Toronto. Still, sub-standard housing in the units within the older buildings remains a concern of local city councillors and local community members. Numerous conversions into bachelorettes were done illegally and conditions did not conform to building or fire codes. An initiative, known as the \\"Parkdale Pilot Project\\" was formed to address the illegal conversions, seeking to bring the buildings into line. One location on King Street was the location of the 'Pope Squat' where Ontario Coalition Against Poverty activists squatted in a vacant apartment building during a visit of Pope John Paul II. After being vacant for over ten years (most of which it was owned by the Government of Ontario), the building eventually re- opened as apartments, after its redevelopment was approved by the Pilot Project's housing committee.. An apartment building on the corner of Queen Street and Dowling Avenue also lay vacant for some time before being expropriated by the city for an affordable housing re-development. It is known as Edmond Place and is a partnership of the City with PARC. The commercial uses along Queen Street West have seen changes. In 2013, a sudden proliferation of restaurants and bars in one area led to a bylaw limiting the number to 25% of establishments. The bylaw was rescinded in 2018, with a continuing probition on backyard and rooftop patios. In 2018, several vegan businesses owned by a single owner \\"The 5700\\" opened, between Dufferin and Brock Street. The company attempted to market the area as \\"Vegandale\\", dropping the idea after community protest against gentrification and a conflict with the Parkdale Village BIA. Two of the businesses closed in 2020. An increase in the number of residents of Tibetan origin has led to the opening of Tibetan businesses and restaurants informally known as \\"Little Tibet\\". Education Parkdale Collegiate Institute is a public secondary school operated by the Toronto District School Board. There are four Toronto- based school boards that provides public education for the city, including the neighbourhood of Parkdale. Two of the four Toronto-based school boards are English first language public school boards, the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). The institutions operated by the other two Toronto-based school boards, the secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and separate Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir, are French first language public school boards. However, neither French-language school board operates a school in Parkdale. The following elementary and secondary schools are located in Parkdale: * Parkdale Collegiate Institute, a TDSB secondary school on Jameson Avenue south of Queen Street. It was founded in the 1880s. * Queen Victoria Public School, is a TDSB elementary school on Close Avenue at King Street. * Parkdale Public School is a TDSB elementary school which includes preschool to grade 8. It is on Seaforth avenue. * Holy Family Catholic School, a TCDSB elementary school, a part of Holy Family Parish on Close Avenue. Founded in 1900, two years before the parish church and present school opened at their current location, Holy Family School was created out of Toronto's original west end parish and school of St. Helen's and was first in Parkdale's Masonic Hall on the south side of Queen Street near Dowling Ave. The school was served for many years by the Sisters of Loreto who commuted from their convent in Toronto's downtown. As population increased in the Parkdale area, the school was enlarged many times such that the standing remains of the original building are now obscured. In 2004 a community centre opened in the school newly built additional building, also at that time, Toronto's archbishop invited fathers of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri in Montreal to come to Toronto to serve Holy Family Church and school. When the original Holy Family Church burned in 1997, the congregation worshipped in the school while funds were raised to build a new church.Fifty Golden Years : Holy Family Parish TORONTO, ONTARIO 1902 - 1952 Transportation The 501 Queen streetcar in Parkdale, one of several public transportation services operated by the TTC There are several routes serving Parkdale. Along Queen and King Streets, streetcars provide service. Along Lansdowne Avenue and Dufferin Street, bus service is provided, connecting to the Bloor-Danforth subway to the north. The 504 King streetcar route along King Street connects to Dundas West station via Roncesvalles Avenue. Main streets A former Bank of British North America branch on King Street, a major road in the neighbourhood Queen Street West running east‚Äìwest is the primary commercial street of the neighbourhood. It is four lanes and the buildings are predominantly 2-3 storey buildings, often with apartments on the upper floors. It ends at Roncesvalles, meeting King Street and the Queensway at the 'Sunnyside' intersection. It continues to the east to downtown. The business along Queen have formed a Business Improvement Association under the name of \\"Parkdale Village.\\" The street has numerous art galleries, restaurants, cafes and convenience stores. The Parkdale branch of the Toronto Public Library is at Cowan Avenue. King Street West, running east‚Äìwest is a major street continuing to the east to Toronto's downtown, ending to the west at Sunnyside. From Roncesvalles east, it curves along the original shoreline, which is about above and inland from the shoreline. The south side in that area is open, with views of the Lake. It is predominantly residential, with a commercial section around the intersection with Dufferin Street. Dufferin Street, running north‚Äìsouth is a major street starting from the CNE to the south, north to Queen Street, where it intersects the railway. The street continues one block to the north and continues north to north of Toronto. It is mixed commercial and residential. South of King along the east side is an old industrial area with loft-type industrial buildings. Construction has been completed to eliminate the Dufferin Street jog at Queen and the railway tracks. Dufferin Street now runs directly north to Wilson Avenue. Lansdowne Avenue, running north‚Äìsouth from Queen Street north to St. Clair Avenue. It is predominantly a residential street. The former West Toronto Collegiate, now a francophone high school is at College Street and Lansdowne. The former National Cash Register factory at Dundas Street has been a grocery store since the 1980s. Jameson Avenue, running north‚Äìsouth from Queen Street south to Lake Shore Boulevard. It is predominantly a residential street of apartment buildings. There are two schools on Jameson, Parkdale Collegiate, near Queen, and Queen Victoria Public, just south of King Street.

In 2011 it had a population of 10,407. Jibou includes the town proper and other four villages: Rona (Hungarian: Szil√°gyr√≥na), Cuceu (Kucs√≥), Husia (Hossz√∫√∫jfalu) and Var (Szamos≈ërmez≈ë). Jibou is 25 km northeast of the county seat ZalƒÉu; the two are linked by national road DN1H and county road DJ108A, as well as by railroad. Its major attractions are the old Wessel√©nyi Castle, Vasile Fati Botanical Garden and the thermal baths.  Geography  Jibou is located in the northeastern part of SƒÉlaj County, on the left bank of Some»ô River, at its confluence with the Agrij River. It is crossed by the 47¬∞16‚Ä≤N parallel and the 23¬∞15‚Ä≤E meridian.  History  battle of 1705 The city is located in a Daco-Roman area and developed early as a rural settlement. The first documentary attestation of Jibou dates to 1205, under the name Chybur. Among the many names Jibou bore are the titles villa (town) in 1219 and oppidum (fortified town) in 1564, which attest the importance of the locality at the time. Jibou is likely older than its first documentary attestation, given that the Roman road connecting the castra of TihƒÉu with that of Porolissum passed through its boundary. The other component localities were noted a little later: Rona in 1338, Cuceu in 1388, Husia in 1405 and Var in 1469. The development of Jibou continued in medieval times, but suffered from Turkish invasions such as those in 1610 and 1665. Jibou is well known for his participation in the Kurucz rebellion (1703‚Äì1711) (see Battle of Zsib√≥) taken against Habsburg rule. The Wessel√©nyi family played an important role in the evolution of Jibou, which built a castle there in 1584; today, only traces of the foundation are preserved. The construction of the current castle, the largest baroque complex in Transylvania, began in 1778 and lasted more than 30 years. The most prominent representative of this family was Baron Mikl√≥s Wessel√©nyi, Jr., who lived between 1796 and 1850. He fought for the liberation of the serfs, being considered the leader of the reformist Hungarian nobility opposition, which struggled against the conservatism of Habsburg monarchy. The evolution of Jibou was closely linked to the name of Hungarian statesman Mikl√≥s Wessel√©nyi. In 1781, his father, Mikl√≥s Wessel√©nyi, Sr., conflicts with aulic chancellor Johan Haller, his neighbor from G√¢rbou. On 16 October 1781, with an army of 540 people, armed \\"some with rifles, most with scythes, iron pitchforks, cudgels\\" and 12 outlaws (), Mikl√≥s Wessel√©nyi appears at G√¢rbou, taking Haller by surprise, who did not expect such a gesture. As a result of this conflict, Haller sends Wessel√©nyi to trial for six counts: \\"blasphemy, crooked oath, fire implementing threat, challenge to a duel, infestation and arrest of royal officials, disturbing public security\\". The process is settled only after three years, when the very Emperor Joseph II, son of Maria Theresa, condemns Wessel√©nyi to several years of prison at Kufstein. The last forty-eighter revolutionary army in Europe, made up of about 8,000 soldiers commanded by General Kazinczy, capitulated at the castle on 25 August 1849. From 1876 to 1920, Jibou was part of the Szil√°gy County of the Kingdom of Hungary. Inauguration of Dej‚ÄìJibou‚ÄìZalƒÉu railway in 1890, and over several years to Baia Mare, made Jibou to become an important railway center. Through the development of industries and construction of railway the number of employees and workers increased. Nevertheless, agriculture remained main branch of the economy, especially after the introduction of alternative crops and the use of agricultural machines. To the end of 19th century in Jibou established many Jewish families, which made to increase the role of exchange of the locality. The main occupation of the Jews was trade; they opened a number of stores. Jibou in 1927 Documents of the time attested that residents here have participated in the Bob√¢lna uprising (1437) and the revolt led by Gheorghe Doja in 1514. Locals fought oppression by outlawry and local uprisings, which have been reported both in the 17th century, and in the 18th century. During the rebellion led by Horea, Clo»ôca and Cri»ôan in 1784 and during the revolution of 1848, serfs in Jibou have been with the thought and deeds by the side of other exploited inhabitants of the Transylvanian settlements, regardless of nationality. The Great National Assembly in Alba Iulia (1 December 1918) was also attended by delegates from Jibou, headed by Gheorghe Petruca. On 16 October 1944 enter in Jibou the Romanian army and liberates the locality. In 1950, Jibou became a district seat within the Cluj Region; it lost the statute in 1960, when the district seat became ZalƒÉu. Jibou was declared a town in 1968, when a new administrative law was adopted .  Demography  According to the population census of 2011, Jibou numbered at that time 10,407 inhabitants, of which 5,141 male and 5,266 female. Decrease in population is mainly due to negative natural growth, but also emigration to other western European countries. According to the 2011 census, the city's population is made up of 8,210 Romanians (9,181 in 2002), alongside also live 1,192 Hungarians (1,503 in 2002), 584 Gypsies (603 in 2002), 5 Ukrainians (3 in 2002), 3 Slovaks (2 in 2002) and 7 of other nationalities. Likewise, 401 persons have not declared their ethnicity.

If before 1968 it had only one industrial unit, Red Star (, ), that produced joinery articles, in the years that followed were built and expanded: the Flax Plant, the Clothing Firm, the Flax Melter, the Dairy, the Mining Company, the CFR Depot, sections of the ZalƒÉu Enterprise of Industrial Armature of Iron and Steel, ZalƒÉu Ceramics, the Forest Unit of Exploitation and Transport, the handicraft cooperatives the Craftsmen Collective and the Progress and others. After 1989, some of these economic units have ceased work, others had reprofiled, adapting in one way or another to market economy. The most worrisome effect is the large number of unemployed, which is why it falls upon the general standard of living of the inhabitants.  Industry  In terms of industry, Jibou has profiled, in time, on certain sectors of light industry, wood processing, food, crafts and construction. Productive units have small production capacities, but optimally harness material and human resources of the area. In this regard can be mentioned: Confec»õii SA, Samtex, Multiprod, Mining Company, BƒÉlƒÉnean Mill, the Progress cooperative, the Craftsman cooperative, the Cheese Factory, Absolut Typography, Clem SRL, Calion Prod, etc.  Agriculture and silviculture  Fertile lands in Some»ô meadow and terraces favored the cultivation of the main agricultural plants, but also the animals' growth. Along with acreage, appear sectors covered by deciduous forests, which complete the natural landscape.  Commerce  The geographical position of the city favored the layout of a market for sale of industrial and agricultural products, but also of an animal market. There are many commercial units making a wide range of products, such as: Bujor SNC, Alfa, But Impex, BƒÉlƒÉnean, Tora, Baciu, Paloma, Criss and Consumcoop units.  Services  In order to meet certain needs of the population, there are many units providing services, such as: Prod Fize»ô, Arcada, Consomes, Tinca SRL, the Craftsman cooperative, the Progress cooperative, that perform construction, plumbing, heating and water works, carpentry, repair of household appliances, auto repair shops, etc.  Banking system  Monetary circulation in the city and surroundings is provided by the CEC Bank, the Romanian Commercial Bank, the Romanian Bank for Development, the Treasury and the Credit Cooperative.

It is inorganic, colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and non-toxic. has an octahedral geometry, consisting of six fluorine atoms attached to a central sulfur atom. It is a hypervalent molecule. Typical for a nonpolar gas, is poorly soluble in water but quite soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. It has a density of 6.12 g/L at sea level conditions, considerably higher than the density of air (1.225 g/L). It is generally transported as a liquefied compressed gas. Synthesis and reactions can be prepared from the elements through exposure of to . This was also the method used by the discoverers Henri Moissan and Paul Lebeau in 1901. Some other sulfur fluorides are cogenerated, but these are removed by heating the mixture to disproportionate any (which is highly toxic) and then scrubbing the product with NaOH to destroy remaining . Alternatively, utilizing bromine, sulfur hexafluoride can be synthesized from SF4 and CoF3 at lower temperatures (e.g. 100 ¬∞C), as follows: There is virtually no reaction chemistry for . A main contribution to the inertness of SF6 is the steric hindrance of the sulfur atom, whereas its heavier group 16 counterparts, such as SeF6 are more reactive than SF6 as a result of less steric hindrance (See hydrolysis example). It does not react with molten sodium below its boiling point, Extract of page 160 but reacts exothermically with lithium. Greenhouse gas Mauna Loa sulfur hexafluoride timeseries. Atmospheric concentration of SF6 vs. similar man-made gases (right graph). Note the log scale. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is the most potent greenhouse gas that it has evaluated, with a global warming potential of 23,900 times that of when compared over a 100-year period. Sulfur hexafluoride is inert in the troposphere and stratosphere and is extremely long-lived, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800‚Äì3,200 years. Measurements of SF6 show that its global average mixing ratio has reached over 10 parts per trillion (ppt) as of April 2020, and is increasing by about 0.35 ppt (3.5 percent) per year. Average global SF6 concentrations increased by about seven percent per year during the 1980s and 1990s, mostly as the result of its use in magnesium production, and by electrical utilities and electronics manufacturers. Given the small amounts of SF6 released compared to carbon dioxide, its overall individual contribution to global warming is estimated to be less than 0.2 percent, however the collective contribution of it and similar man-made halogenated gases has reached about 10 percent as of year 2020. Alternatives are being tested. In Europe, falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its use for several applications. Since 1 January 2006, is banned as a tracer gas and in all applications except high-voltage switchgear. It was reported in 2013 that a three-year effort by the United States Department of Energy to identify and fix leaks at its laboratories in the United States such as the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where the gas is used as a high voltage insulator, had been productive, cutting annual leaks by . This was done by comparing purchases with inventory, assuming the difference was leaked, then locating and fixing the leaks. Applications More than 10,000 tons of are produced per year, most of which (over 8,000 tons) is used as a gaseous dielectric medium in the electrical industry. Other main uses include an inert gas for the casting of magnesium, and as an inert filling for insulated glazing windows. Dielectric medium is used in the electrical industry as a gaseous dielectric medium for high-voltage circuit breakers, switchgear, and other electrical equipment, often replacing oil-filled circuit breakers (OCBs) that can contain harmful PCBs. gas under pressure is used as an insulator in gas insulated switchgear (GIS) because it has a much higher dielectric strength than air or dry nitrogen. The high dielectric strength is a result of the gas's high electronegativity and density. This property makes it possible to significantly reduce the size of electrical gear. This makes GIS more suitable for certain purposes such as indoor placement, as opposed to air- insulated electrical gear, which takes up considerably more room. Gas- insulated electrical gear is also more resistant to the effects of pollution and climate, as well as being more reliable in long-term operation because of its controlled operating environment. Exposure to an arc chemically breaks down though most of the decomposition products tend to quickly re-form , a process termed \\"self-healing\\". Arcing or corona can produce disulfur decafluoride (), a highly toxic gas, with toxicity similar to phosgene. was considered a potential chemical warfare agent in World War II because it does not produce lacrimation or skin irritation, thus providing little warning of exposure. is also commonly encountered as a high voltage dielectric in the high voltage supplies of particle accelerators, such as Van de Graaff generators and Pelletrons and high voltage transmission electron microscopes. Alternatives to as a dielectric gas include several fluoroketones. Medical use is used to provide a tamponade or plug of a retinal hole in retinal detachment repair operations in the form of a gas bubble. It is inert in the vitreous chamber and initially doubles its volume in 36 hours before being absorbed in the blood in 10‚Äì14 days. is used as a contrast agent for ultrasound imaging. Sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles are administered in solution through injection into a peripheral vein. These microbubbles enhance the visibility of blood vessels to ultrasound. This application has been used to examine the vascularity of tumours. It remains visible in the blood for 3 to 8 minutes, and is exhaled by the lungs. Tracer compound Sulfur hexafluoride was the tracer gas used in the first roadway air dispersion model calibration; this research program was sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and conducted in Sunnyvale, California on U.S. Highway 101. Gaseous is used as a tracer gas in short-term experiments of ventilation efficiency in buildings and indoor enclosures, and for determining infiltration rates. Two major factors recommend its use: its concentration can be measured with satisfactory accuracy at very low concentrations, and the Earth's atmosphere has a negligible concentration of . Sulfur hexafluoride was used as a non-toxic test gas in an experiment at St. John's Wood tube station in London, United Kingdom on 25 March 2007. The gas was released throughout the station, and monitored as it drifted around. The purpose of the experiment, which had been announced earlier in March by the Secretary of State for Transport Douglas Alexander, was to investigate how toxic gas might spread throughout London Underground stations and buildings during a terrorist attack. Sulfur hexafluoride is also routinely used as a tracer gas in laboratory fume hood containment testing. The gas is used in the final stage of ASHRAE 110 fume hood qualification. A plume of gas is generated inside of the fume hood and a battery of tests are performed while a gas analyzer arranged outside of the hood samples for SF6 to verify the containment properties of the fume hood. It has been used successfully as a tracer in oceanography to study diapycnal mixing and air-sea gas exchange.

This is related to the more well-known effect of breathing low-density helium, which causes someone's voice to become much higher. Both of these effects should only be attempted with caution as these gases displace oxygen that the lungs are attempting to extract from the air. Sulfur hexafluoride is also mildly anesthetic. * For science demonstrations / magic as \\"invisible water\\" since a light foil boat can be floated in a tank, as will an air-filled balloon Physiological effects and precautions Like xenon, sulfur hexafluoride is a nontoxic gas, but by displacing oxygen in the lungs, it also carries the risk of asphyxia if too much is inhaled. Since it is more dense than air, a substantial quantity of gas, when released, will settle in low-lying areas and present a significant risk of asphyxiation if the area is entered. That is particularly relevant to its use as an insulator in electrical equipment since workers may be in trenches or pits below equipment containing . As with all gases, the density of affects the resonance frequencies of the vocal tract, thus changing drastically the vocal sound qualities, or timbre, of those who inhale it. It does not affect the vibrations of the vocal folds. The density of sulfur hexafluoride is relatively high at room temperature and pressure due to the gas's large molar mass. Unlike helium, which has a molar mass of about 4 g/mol and pitches the voice up, has a molar mass of about 146 g/mol, and the speed of sound through the gas is about 134 m/s at room temperature, pitching the voice down. For comparison, the molar mass of air, which is about 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, is approximately 30 g/mol which leads to a speed of sound of 343 m/s. Sulfur hexafluoride has an anesthetic potency slightly lower than nitrous oxide; Sulfur hexafluoride is classified as a mild anesthetic.

Between 1934 and the German annexation in 1938, the Federal State (Bundesstaat √ñsterreich) used a different coat of arms, which consisted of a double-headed eagle (one-party corporate state led by the clerico-right-wing Fatherland Front). The establishment of the Second Republic in 1945 saw the return of the original arms, with broken chains added to symbolise Austria's liberation. In 1981 the Wappen der Republik √ñsterreich (Bundeswappen) described the blazon in the Federal Constitutional Law (Austrian act) (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz, B-VG). With this change of law it was defined that the specific drawing is to codificate in an own statute law and that all other versions of the coat of arms of Austria were no longer in law. In accordance to this the Wappengesetz from 1984 and the drawing of the actual Wappen der Republik √ñsterreich is in Austrian law. The often used ‚Ä≥Bundesadler‚Ä≥ (‚Ä≥federal eagle‚Ä≥) is only a synonymous term in colloquial language. Description=Appearance In Art. 8a Abs. 2 B-VG the blazon of the Federal Arms of the Republic of Austria is described as follows: > Das Wappen der Republik √ñsterreich (Bundeswappen) besteht aus einem > freischwebenden, eink√∂pfigen, schwarzen, golden gewaffneten und rot > bezungten Adler, dessen Brust mit einem roten, von einem silbernen > Querbalken durchzogenen Schild belegt ist. Der Adler tr√§gt auf seinem Haupt > eine goldene Mauerkrone mit drei sichtbaren Zinnen. Die beiden F√§nge > umschlie√üt eine gesprengte Eisenkette. Er tr√§gt im rechten Fang eine goldene > Sichel mit einw√§rts gekehrter Schneide, im linken Fang einen goldenen > Hammer. In translation: > Gules a fess Argent, escutcheon on the breast of an eagle displayed Sable, > langued Gules, beaked Or, crowned with a mural crown of three visible > merlons Or, armed Or, dexter talon holding sickle, sinister talon holding > hammer, both talons shackled with chain broken Argent. In accordance of Art. 8a Abs. 3 the actual withdrawn of the Wappen der Republik √ñsterreich is in law as of ¬ß 1 Wappengesetz from 1984: > Das Wappen der Republik √ñsterreich (Bundeswappen) ist im Art. 8a Abs. 2 B-VG > bestimmt und entspricht der Zeichnung des Bundeswappens in der einen > Bestandteil dieses Gesetzes bildenden Anlage 1. This artistic version as above described with the drawing in attachment 1 of Wappengesetz 1984 in which the eagle's feathers are grey and detailed, with the colours of bluegrey for the chain and dark gold for the other signs, is the actual official coat of arms of the Republic of Austria. There are some other different versions of the arms in use as of more in accordance to the blason of Art. 8a Abs. 2 B-VG, in which the eagle is represented plain black, the undefined colour of the chain and the yellow as heraldic gold. All these versions are used in parallel. Symbolism The symbols and emblems used in the Austrian arms are as follows: *The Eagle: Austria's sovereignty (introduced 1919) *The escutcheon: (late Middle Ages, reintroduced 1915; see also: Flag of Austria) *The mural crown: Middle class (bourgeoisie, introduced 1919) *The sickle: Farmer's class (peasants, introduced 1919) *The Hammer: Working class (introduced 1919) *The broken chains: Liberation from German occupation (added 1945) Discussions about the arms have been triggered in the past by differing political interpretations, especially by the use of the hammer and the sickle and the broken chains, since the crossed hammer and sickle are a widespread symbol of communism, as is the breaking of chains. Surveys have however confirmed, that understanding of the actual symbolism of the arms is widespread.Lit.: Diem: Die Symbole √ñsterreichs On the one hand the arms serve as a new republican symbol, on the other as a modified version of the historical Habsburg arms. The current version of the arms is often regarded as being reminiscent of the double-headed eagle of the Habsburg monarchy. According to this interpretation, the single headed eagle alludes, in the sense of the removal of the left hand, \\"Hungarian\\" head, to the removal of the eastern part of the Habsburg Empire. However, Addendum 202 to the 1919 Law on the State Arms and the State Seal of the Republic of German Austria states expressly that the \\"new\\" single headed Austrian eagle is based not on the double headed eagle (symbol of the Habsburgs since 1804, and previously of the Holy Roman Empire), but rather on the \\"symbol of the legions of the Roman Republic\\", the Aquila.Lit.: Diem: Die Entwicklung des √∂sterreichischen Bundeswappens, Abschnitt Das Staatswappen der Republik (Deutsch)√∂sterreich The Austrian federal states have however retained pre-republican heraldic traditions (mostly heraldic images from the Middle Ages, but also diverse accoutrements such as archducal and ducal hats, and knights' helmets). The tower arms as first proposal in 1918  Reconstruction of the tower arms On 31 October 1918, the council of state agreed upon the colours of the republic (red-white-red) as well as the new coat of arms composed personally by chancellor Karl Renner. The coat of arms was composed quickly due to the need for having a seal at the peace talks after World War I. The coat of arms consisted of a black tower representing the bourgeoisie, two crossed red hammers representing workers and a golden wreath of wheat representing farmers. The colours black, red and gold was deliberately chosen because they were the national colours of Germany, the three colours associated with republican Germany (as opposed to red, white and black), as first manifested within German lands in 1778. However, the new coat of arms was withdrawn as it was met with heavy criticism from, for example, Adolf Loos and heraldists; the proposal was seen as too similar to commercial advertising. A decision by the council of ministers on 8 May 1919 replaced the tower arms with the eagle.

History Kingdomtide was a liturgical season or sub-season observed only by Protestant churches, especially Methodists and Presbyterians. Green was traditionally the color of the day throughout this season as it is a part of the season of Ordinary Time. In 1937, the Federal Council of Churches (now known as the National Council of Churches) recommended that the entire part of the Christian calendar between Pentecost and Advent be named Kingdomtide; however, two years later the Methodist Episcopal Church adopted the term only for the second half of this time period. Precise criteria for determining when Kingdomtide began varied in different localities. The most common practice was to start the season on the Sunday on or nearest August 31, which gave Kingdomtide 13 Sundays every year; in some places, Kingdomtide began on the last Sunday in August, giving the season 13 Sundays in some years and 14 in others. The last Sunday before Advent begins is observed as the Feast of Christ the King. The liturgy for Kingdomtide stressed charity and assistance to the poor, in contrast to the preceding Sundays after Pentecost, when a more spiritual mission was emphasized. Green vestments and paraments were used at church services during Kingdomtide, replacing the red used on the Sundays after Pentecost (in churches that did not recognize Kingdomtide as a separate season, green was generally deployed throughout the entire period between Pentecost and Advent). By 1992, the United Methodist Church was the only denomination still using the term Kingdomtide, and even within the United Methodist Church the observance has almost completely ceased, with most congregations adopting the more common ecumenical pattern of a season of Ordinary Time between Pentecost and Advent. Anglican Usage In the Church of England, \\"the period between All Saints' Day and the First Sunday of Advent is observed as a time of celebration and reflection on the reign of Christ in earth and heaven\\".Common Worship: Daily Prayer, p. xx In the Church of England liturgical colours are recommended but not mandatory, so while red is encouraged during this period, individual churches may continue to use green until Advent. This period, called All Saints to Advent in the Church of England's liturgical material, is often nicknamed Kingdomtide or the Kingdom season.

The focal point of the emblem is a stylized flame. The flame is in the shape of the word \\"Allah\\" written in Arabic to represent the country's majority-Muslim population. As well as a reference to Azerbaijan's eternal natural oil-gas resources, which has given it the nickname \\"land of eternal fire\\". Article 23 The emblem is supported by a crossed stalk of wheat and an oak bough. Wheat is the symbol of abundance in Azerbaijan since Azerbaijan has become the motherland of many Prophets and their descendants all the history. Also, wheat bread is the main staple food. The oak tree is the symbol of power and youth in time. History The emblem of Azerbaijan under the Soviet Union (Azerbaijan S.S.R.) The government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic declared a competition on the national emblem of Azerbaijan on 30 January 1920 and made a decision to present the emblem model on May of the same year. However, due to the collapse of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic on 28 April 1920, the emblem was not approved. The Supreme Mejlis of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic discussed the issue connected with the national emblem and sent a petition to the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR on the declaration of a new competition on the national emblem of Azerbaijan on 17 November 1990. The competition was declared by the decision of the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan Republic on 5 February 1991. Tens of projects of the emblem were presented during the competition of 1991‚Äì1992 and it was also proposed to approve one of the projects developed between 1919‚Äì1920. By the Constitutional Law of the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan Republic, approved on 19 January 1993, one of the projects, developed between 1919‚Äì1920 with certain alterations was confirmed the national emblem of Azerbaijan. Like other post-Soviet republics whose symbols do not predate the October Revolution, the current emblem retained partial components of the Soviet one such as the wheat and the colour red on the shield previously seen in the banners. Meaning The colours used in composing the emblem are taken from the national flag. The green represents Islam; red represents the development and democracy of Azerbaijan, and blue represents that the Azerbaijanis are a Turkic people. The eight-pointed star (octagram) itself stands for the eight branches of the Turkic peoples, and between each point of the star, there is a smaller yellow circle found. The National Emblem symbolizes the independence of Azerbaijan. It is the image of an oriental shield and a semicircle formed by the branches of an oak-tree and ears resting on it. The shield contains the image of a fire that resemble the \\"land of fire\\" ‚Äì in the center of an eight- point star against a background of the colours of the National flag.http://www.meclis.gov.az/?/az/topcontent/20 Usage The Azerbaijani emblem appears on: *The residence and the private office of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic; *The building of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Republic, its conference hall and the private office of the chair of the parliament; *All courts, buildings of military tribunals, halls of judicial assembly; private offices of the chairs of the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court of the Azerbaijan Republic; *Buildings of state bodies in cases stipulated in the legislative system of the Azerbaijan Republic; *Buildings of diplomatic and trade representations and consulates of the Azerbaijan Republic.

The design has undergone slight modifications since then, namely in 1971 in 2002 when mantling and the indentations of the chief were modified respectively, but the influence of the original design is still clearly visible in the modern blazon. The arms act as a governmental and national symbol in addition to being the personal arms of the king; only the king, however, may display the royal crown ensigning the coat of arms. History The General Maritime Treaty of 1820 created Bahrain as a protectorate of the United Kingdom, establishing a long line of British governors and advisers to the sheiks and hakims that ruled over the island nation. In 1932, the then-British governor and advisor to the sheik, Charles Belgrave, assisted with designing a coat of arms for the reigning sheik, Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa.

After the United Kingdom withdrew from Bahrain in 1971, red mantling with a white lining was added to the coat of arms as a symbol of the island nation's newly acquired independent sovereignty. The mantling is displayed around the shield without a helm or torse, in a manner unusual to traditional heraldic practice. The Princely coat of arms still displayed the Crown when used as the personal arms of Emir, though the Crown was modified to have smaller points displayed between the space of each point. The arms displayed with the mantling sans Crown became the arms of dominion for Bahrain.De Vries, Hubert. \\"Bahrain.\\" 28 September 2007. Web. 19 February 2011.

During its protracted development, a wide variety of other roles were suggested for it. Late in the war, the design was resurrected for consideration as a Selbstopfer (suicide weapon) aircraft, but was judged unsuitable even for this purpose. The tiny fighter was to have been propelled by pulsejets, but the unsuitability of these engines doomed the Me 328 from the start. History=Design The aircraft was designed as Messerschmitt project P.1073 in 1941, and was originally conceived as a cheap and simple escort fighter, to either be towed aloft by a Heinkel He 177 heavy bomber or Junkers Ju 388 using a semi-rigid bar (the Deichselschlepp, which was also considered for towing winged auxiliary fuel tanks), or carried on a Me 264 in a Mistel type fashion.Me.328 (in Russian) Three versions were proposed: an unpowered glider, a version powered by Argus pulsejets, and a version powered by a Jumo 004 turbojet.Wood & Ford, pp. 41-42 Its construction was to be mainly of wood. It was subsequently handed over to the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Segelflug (DFS - \\"German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight\\") for development. Two versions were proposed, the Me 328A (fighter) and the Me 328B (bomber); it was estimated that four Me 328s could be built for the cost of a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 or Bf 109 fighter. It was also suggested at one point that it be towed behind the Me 264 heavy bomber for protection.Wood & Ford, p. 30 One of the main problems that the project faced was with engines - the pulse jets didn't operate well at high to medium altitudes (where most combat would take place) due to the lower air pressure. The engines also generated a huge amount of noise which could be heard miles away, making them unsuitable. Prototypes Test pilot Hanna Reitsch carried out a test programme on the two prototypes of the glider version, releasing from its carrier aircraft at altitudes of . Ground launches, using both cable-type catapults and rocket- assisted carriages on rails were also successful. Even with a reduced wingspan the aircraft had a very satisfactory performance, and it was planned to build up to 1,000 for use as disposable bombers to be flown by volunteers from 5/KG200, the so-called Leonidas Squadron. Seven prototypes powered by two Argus As 014 pulsejets, as used on the V-1 flying bomb were built by glider manufacturer, Jacobs-Schweyer of Darmstadt. It was intended for use as a fighter aircraft, to be armed with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons. However, during static testing it soon became apparent that the same problems which were to plague the early development of the V-1 flying bomb - namely, excessive vibration - would make the project difficult to bring to a successful conclusion, and the manned flight programme was suspended in mid-1944, after only a few test flights had been made. Some sources say two prototypes were destroyed by inflight structural failure caused by vibration. Despite this, planning continued, and a version was projected, which would use four Argus pulsejets, two mounted below the wings in addition to the original pair mounted above the rear fuselage. Bomber versions of both types were proposed, and work continued on them at the insistence of Adolf Hitler long after the point when anything other than token use could have been made of them. Moves were made to revive the Me 328 again in 1944 as a piloted flying bomb based on the Me 328B, fitted with a bomb, but it was dropped in favour of the Fieseler Fi 103R (Reichenberg). Two differing revised versions - one designated as the Me 328C, to be fitted with a Jumo 004 turbojet ‚Äî and another, in-house proposal that did not receive a letter suffix, used two As 014 pulsejets mounted on pylons mounted onto the rear fuselage sides ‚Äî refitted with a twin tail empennage design ‚Äî along with a Porsche 109-005 single-use turbojet of thrust in the same dorsal rear location as meant for its use on the V-1, allowed with the new twin-tail designMe 328 proposal for two As 014/Porsche 109-005 propulsion ‚Äî but neither of these proposals came to anything. Owing to the basic idea of short-life reaction propulsion units to power it, the Me 328 project is often listed as a suicide weapon, however the aircraft was not intended as such.German Suicidal Aircraft Proposed roles A wide variety of roles were suggested for the aircraft, ranging from a point-defence interceptor, to a version with folding wings and twin pulsejets to be launched from a catapult on a U-Boat, to a ground-attack aircraft. Various modifications to the prototypes were made to evaluate their suitability for these missions, and different engine configurations were tested. Despite all this, the vibration problem simply could not be overcome and the program was abandoned in early 1944, even as production facilities were being readied to construct the aircraft at the Jacobs Schweyer sailplane factory in Darmstadt. According to Thomas Powers's book Heisenberg's War the idea of using the Me 328 as a parasite bomber within the Amerika Bomber program was explored. It was to be carried by or towed behind either an Me 264 or a Ju 390 to attack New York City. Plans for this tactic ‚Äî first proposed as much as nine months before Heinkel's trans-Atlantic Amerika Bomber design competitor received its own RLM designation ‚Äî were hatched from a meeting between Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch and Generalmajor Eccard Freiherr von Gablenz at Berlin on 12 May 1942. After release, the Me 328 pilot would release a bomb over Manhattan and then ditch at sea near a U-boat. The idea was dropped in August 1942.

The significance of being a Galois extension is that the extension has a Galois group and obeys the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. See the article Galois group for definitions of some of these terms and some examples. A result of Emil Artin allows one to construct Galois extensions as follows: If E is a given field, and G is a finite group of automorphisms of E with fixed field F, then E/F is a Galois extension. Characterization of Galois extensions An important theorem of Emil Artin states that for a finite extension E/F, each of the following statements is equivalent to the statement that E/F is Galois: *E/F is a normal extension and a separable extension. *E is a splitting field of a separable polynomial with coefficients in F. *!\\\\operatorname{Aut}(E/F) = [E:F], that is, the number of automorphisms equals the degree of the extension. Other equivalent statements are: *Every irreducible polynomial in F[x] with at least one root in E splits over E and is separable. *!\\\\operatorname{Aut}(E/F) \\\\geq [E:F], that is, the number of automorphisms is at least the degree of the extension. *F is the fixed field of a subgroup of \\\\operatorname{Aut}(E). *F is the fixed field of \\\\operatorname{Aut}(E/F). *There is a one-to-one correspondence between subfields of E/F and subgroups of \\\\operatorname{Aut}(E/F). Examples There are two basic ways to construct examples of Galois extensions. * Take any field E, any subgroup of \\\\operatorname{Aut}(E), and let F be the fixed field. * Take any field F, any separable polynomial in F[x], and let E be its splitting field. Adjoining to the rational number field the square root of 2 gives a Galois extension, while adjoining the cubic root of 2 gives a non- Galois extension. Both these extensions are separable, because they have characteristic zero. The first of them is the splitting field of x^2 -2; the second has normal closure that includes the complex cubic roots of unity, and so is not a splitting field. In fact, it has no automorphism other than the identity, because it is contained in the real numbers and x^3 -2 has just one real root. For more detailed examples, see the page on the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. An algebraic closure \\\\bar K of an arbitrary field K is Galois over K if and only if K is a perfect field.

Fry's is a division of Cincinnati, Ohio-based Kroger. History=Beginnings Fry's was founded in 1954 by Donald Fry in northern California. With the help of his brother Charles, the chain expanded into the Phoenix market in 1960. Fry's was sold in 1972 to Dillons, based in Hutchinson, Kansas.Some sources state that the sale was to Modesto-based Save Mart Supermarkets. (The sons of Charles Fry used the proceeds from the sale to launch Fry's Electronics in 1985; it is otherwise separate from and unaffiliated with the grocery chain.) Dillons merged with Kroger in 1983.Kroger-Dillon merger approved Fred Meyer and Kroger merger Typical Fry's Food and Drug Store in Phoenix, Arizona In October 1998, Fred Meyer, parent company of Smith's Food and Drug based in Salt Lake City, announced a strategic merger with Kroger, based in Cincinnati.KROGER TO MERGE WITH FRED MEYER ...

Several months later, in May 1999, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved the merger of the two companies, named The Kroger Co..KROGER AND FRED MEYER MERGER APPROVED Press Release from The Kroger Co. Arizona and Texas were the only two of 31 states where there was an overlap of stores and brands from the merger. The Kroger Co., choosing to operate with one brand in the Arizona market, rebranded most Smith's Food & Drug Centers as Fry's Food & Drug Stores, though Smith's Food and Drug Centers in Kingman, Bullhead City, and Lake Havasu City remained unchanged (perhaps because of their proximity to Nevada and the Las Vegas market, where Kroger retained the Smith's brand).AZ store decision offers glimpse of Kroger plan, a December 1998 article from the Portland Business Journal Fry's Phoenix Distribution Center and administrative offices were moved into the more modern Smith's Food and Drug Distribution Center and office space in the west Phoenix suburb of Tolleson. Fry's Marketplace Fry's Marketplace is a multi- department store that offers full-service grocery, pharmacy and general merchandise including outdoor living products, electronics, home goods and toys. Ranging in size from , the Marketplace stores are smaller than the original Fred Meyer stores. The Marketplace format was derived from the Fred Meyer concept but on a smaller scale and has since expanded to other Kroger divisions (Ohio, Virginia, Texas, etc.), including the Smith's Food & Drug Centers Division in Utah. Fry's Marketplace started out as Smitty's, Arizona's first multi-department store. Smitty's was similar to a Wal-Mart Supercenter and even had a food court with four branded fast food options (such as Taco Bell). In 1996, Smitty's merged with Smith's Food and Drug Centers. In 1997, after the Fred Meyer-Smith's merger, Fred Meyer updated and revitalized the Smitty's concept and in January 1999, all Smitty's stores were renamed Fred Meyer. During this time, management of the chain changed from Smith's Food and Drug to Fred Meyer. Construction also started on a full sized Fred Meyer store in Phoenix. In June 2000, Kroger transferred the management of Fred Meyer's stores to Fry's Food and Drug. The Fred Meyer stores were rebranded as Fry's Marketplace, unifying the stores under the Fry's brand. The Fred Meyer store in Phoenix was completed but never opened and was later demolished as the store was too large for Fry's to use.

He is the future self of Kang the Conqueror. Publication history Immortus first appeared in Avengers #10 and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography At some point in his personal timeline, Kang became weary of battle due to frustration and the loss of his son Marcus and consort Ravonna in several timelines. He was approached by the alien Time-Keepers ‚Äî time travelers from the end of the universe, the last living creatures in existence ‚Äî to become their agent, preserving timelines rather than conquering them in exchange for immortality. He accepted and reinvented himself again, this time as Immortus, the lord of the other-dimensional realm of Limbo. He again came into conflict with the Avengers, but under different circumstances. In his first encounter with the Avengers as Immortus, he attempted the destruction of the Avengers through the use of mythological figures as combatants after trying to join the Masters of Evil, but being told by Baron Zemo he has to defeat one of the Avengers. The Masters attacked the Avengers after Captain America had been taken to the Tower of London in 1760 where Rick Jones was imprisoned. But when he rescued Rick he was returned to his own time and with his help the Masters were defeated at a near-win. This event was apparently erased after the Enchantress turns back time to prevent the Avengers capturing the Masters.Avengers #10 He was partially responsible for the creation of the Vision, allegedly creating a temporal copy of the original Human Torch that the android Ultron used to create the Vision. Later, he even allied with Kang the Conqueror in one of Kang's schemes against the Avengers.Avengers #131 He was betrayed by Kang, and imprisoned while Kang used Immortus's advanced technology to create the first Legion of the Unliving, made up of now-dead characters taken milliseconds before their death.Avengers #132 He was subsequently freed by the Avengers, and revealed to be the future persona of Pharaoh Rama-Tut and Kang the Conqueror. He offered to aid the Vision in learning his past. The Legion of the Unliving were defeated and sent back to their own times, and Kang fled.Giant-Sized Avengers #3 Later, Immortus officiated at the double wedding of the Vision to the Scarlet Witch, and Mantis to the Swordsman.Giant-Sized Avengers #4 He next traveled to the Old West with Thor and Moondragon in pursuit of Kang,Avengers #141 and assisted the Avengers in the defeat of Kang.Avengers #143 Some time later, he allied with the Space Phantom and the giant Tempus, and removed the time travel enchantment from Thor's uru hammer with a trick, though Thor can still manipulate time.Thor #281-282 Later he revealed that he had caused Kang to find his fortress in Limbo, faked his death by leaving what Kang thought were his remains in his fortress, caused the disturbance in the timestream, and had manipulated him into destroying the Kang divergent doubles to stop their effect on the timestream, as they were creating more timelines and duplicates. The Avengers were brought to Limbo by Kang to help him defeat another version. They were captured but escaped. Immortus revealed himself when it appeared only one Kang was left. Immortus also claimed to have mentally manipulated the rescue of Ravonna, who kept his counter-divergency project under observation. When Kang tried to seize a device Immortus held that contained the memories of the slain Kangs and which Immortus claimed made him master of Limbo, he was driven insane and ran into Limbo due to the force of many memories, which all ended in his defeat. Immortus claimed that was Kang's chance to redeem and condemn himself, and was then questioned by the Avengers on the moral issues of what he had done, but he sent the Avengers back to their own time.Avengers #267-269 Much later, he was revealed to have a long-term plot for the manipulation of the Avengers.Avengers West Coast #48 He deleted various time- line universes as part of this plan.Avengers West Coast #53, 55, 59 His plot to use the Scarlet Witch to become the \\"absolute master of time\\" was revealed, and he sent the third Legion of the Unliving to destroy the Avengers.Avengers West Coast #61 He was rendered catatonic for a time by the Time-Keepers as punishment for his attempt to overthrow their rule.Avengers West Coast #62 At this time, the original Human Torch was revealed not to be the progenitor of the Vision,West Coast Avengers #44-45 though this discovery was later itself claimed to be a deception created by a Space Phantom.Avengers Forever #8 Manipulating beliefs regarding the relationship between the Torch and the Vision have been a priority for Immortus due to the Vision's connections to the Scarlet Witch, a 'nexus being' who may have been powerful enough to give birth to children who could threaten some of the most powerful cosmic entities in the universe; disrupting the Witch's relationship with the Vision limited the possibility that she would pass on her potential. Immortus was also responsible for manipulating Iron Man to turn against the Avengers by driving him insane, which resulted in Iron Man's death until he was resurrected by Franklin Richards later.Heroes Reborn: The Return #4 Immortus also came into conflict with his younger self, who was unable to see the reasoning behind Immortus' actions.Avengers Forever #1-12 (1998-1999) Kang's conflict with Immortus was dubbed the \\"Destiny War\\", with Kang aiding a group of temporally- displaced Avengers from multiple time periods in competing against Immortus's schemes, Kang now determined to defy his destiny to become Immortus and become the servant of the Time Keepers. Immortus faked his death several times before ultimately turning on the Time-Keepers to assist the Avengers and, as punishment, was truly killed.Avengers Forever #11 He was resurrected minutes later as temporal energies from the Time-Keepers' attempts to turn Kang directly into Immortus and thus fulfill the time loop caused a backlash - partially due to Kang's will and partly due to the complex temporal energies of the current conflict - that created Kang and Immortus as separate beings, freeing Kang from what he saw as a destiny as a \\"doddering old scholar\\".Avengers Forever #12 When the rash actions of Kang caused the timestream to become critically unbalanced, Immortus allied himself with the Next Avengers and future versions of Iron Man and the Hulk in an attempt to undo the damage. Disguising himself as a younger version of Kang, Immortus traveled back to the 21st century and convinced the Avengers to come to the future so that they could understand what had happened. Once the Avengers had successfully restored the timeline, Immortus turned on his allies and killed Iron Man and the Hulk before the youthful Avengers apparently killed him.Avengers (Vol. 4) #1-6 (May‚ÄìOctober 2010) Powers and abilities Immortus has no superhuman powers, but he possesses a genius intellect, and has advanced and extensive knowledge of travel through and manipulation of time. It is known that he was tutored by the Time-Keepers. Immortus also uses a wide variety of instrumentation for manipulation of and travel through time, most of which he designed. Other versions=Earth X Immortus appears in Earth X, as Pope of the Church of Immortus. The Church of Immortus' goals are to destroy Reed Richards' Human Torches, allowing mankind to keep their mutations. Upon completing this goal, the Church of Immortus would then leave the Earth to colonize the stars. Immortus is advised in his role by a mysterious man known as Mr. Church, who is Mephisto attempting to lead mankind into its own demise. Initially, Immortus was able to travel into and out of Limbo at his own will, through use of a time machine. Mephisto would eventually use this to get past his inability to travel into Limbo directly, and would lock Immortus out of Limbo. Eventually, Immortus would be mutated into Kang by the Terrigen Mists, and destroys his time machine in a rage after Mephisto refers to him as Kang, cursing Mephisto for making him Kang again. In his final appearance in the series, he has come to grips with his being Kang, and vows to help Reed Richards undo the damage his Church of Immortus has caused.

Early life Born into a Roman Catholic family, he became a mechanic, just before the beginning of World War II, with the Soci√©t√© Nationale d'√âtude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation. After the fall of France, he went to Nazi Germany to work in the Messerschmitt aircraft manufacturing plant.Wilsford 302. \\"To this day, it is unclear why he left Paris in 1942 to work in Germany, although he has often been criticized for doing so.\\" He returned to France in May 1943 with forged documents.Bruno Fuligni, La France rouge, 2011. In 1946, he became secretary of the metalworkers' trade union in Issy-les-Moulineaux, and advanced in the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail in his commune from 1951, becoming secretary of the Seine Metallurgical Workers' Union Federation from 1953 to 1956. Political career He joined the party in 1947. In 1956, he was appointed a member of the extended Central Committee and lead the South-Seine PCF local federation, in the bastion of Maurice Thorez, the historical leader of the Party. Three years later, he became a full member of the Central Committee and of the Politburo. His lightning promotion was explained by his professional origins and his devotion to Thorez. Indeed, he was part of the young guard of the General Secretary which participated to the strengthening of Maurice Thorez's leadership, which was covertly disputed by some members of the Politburo (Laurent Casanova and Marcel Servin). In 1961, after the ousting of these, he was nominated secretary for organization. Then, he supported the new General Secretary Waldeck Rochet and in his policy of conciliation with the other left-wing parties. In reaction to the riots of May 1968, in a controversial article published in the party's paper L'Humanit√©, Marchais showed his contempt for Daniel Cohn-Bendit by calling him a \\"German anarchist\\".Brown 178. He accused some students of being \\"false revolutionaries\\" coming from the bourgeoisie. From then on, he was one of the personalities intervening in the media in the name of the PCF. When Rochet fell ill, in 1970, he was promoted junior General Secretary. In fact, he was at this moment the real leader of the PCF. In this, he co-signed the Common Programme with the Socialist Party (PS) and the Movement of Left Radicals (MRG) in June 1972.Lane 614. From 1973 to 1997, he was deputy of Val de Marne d√©partement, a southern Paris suburb. In December 1972, he became officially General Secretary, following Waldeck Rochet's retirement. At first, he pursued the policy of his predecessor in favour of the \\"Union of the Left\\". In this, the PCF sided with Fran√ßois Mitterrand (PS)'s candidacy in the 1974 presidential election. At the beginning of his mandate of General Secretary, the PCF scored around 20% in the elections. But in mid-1970s, it lost its place of \\"first left-wing party\\" to Fran√ßois Mitterrand's Socialist Party. At the beginning, he supported reforms in the party, which participated to Eurocommunism with the Italian Communist Party of Enrico Berlinguer and the Spanish Communist Party of Santiago Carrillo and renounced the notion of a dictatorship of the proletariat (22nd congress, 1976). At first, he faced with the reproaches of Soviet leaders. Then, faced with electoral growing of the PS at the expense of his party, he imposed a re-alignment on the Soviet Union at the end of the 1970s.Penniman 74. The left-wing parties failed to update their Common Programme and lost the 1978 legislative election, even though they were leading in the polls. Outside and inside the party, he was accused of being responsible for this defeat. One year later, he supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979),Brown 1982 13. judged the Communist governments \\"fairly positive\\", and criticized the \\"right-wing drift\\" of the Socialist Party. In the 1981 presidential election, he came fourth in the first round, with 15% of votes, thereafter endorsing Mitterrand, who won the second round.Wilsford, (1995) pp 304-5. He negotiated the entry of four PCF's politician in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy. In 1984, after President Mitterrand renounced the left's Common Programme and the electoral sanction in the European Parliament election (only 11% of votes) the PCF's ministers resigned from the cabinet. An electoral decline ensued and Marchais faced internal dissent from figures such as Pierre Juquin, Claude Poperen and former ministers as Charles Fiterman. Indeed, some party members, notably among the locally elected, accused him of leading a suicidal strategy. He accused them of plotting with Mitterrand in order to dissolve the PCF in Social Democracy. He let Andr√© Lajoinie, leader of the Communist group in the French National Assembly, represent the party in the 1988 presidential election. He was reserved about perestroika. Unlike the Italian Communists, he refused to change the name of the French party after the collapse of the Soviet bloc. In 1994, at the 28th Congress of the PCF, he ceded his place as General Secretary to Robert Hue, although he maintained his titular role as a member of the Politburo - now significantly renamed the National Office. The same year, he became President of the PCF Comit√© pour la d√©fense des libert√©s et droits de l'homme en France et dans le monde (\\"Committee for the defense of human liberties and rights in France and throughout the world\\"). He criticized the renovation of the party under his successor. He died in 1997. Attitudes Georges Marchais was a notable personality because of his mannerisms (Ct'un scandaaaale ‚Äî \\"This is a scandal!\\") and brusque demeanor, often lambasted by comic Thierry Le Luron. He is particularly remembered for an outburst to journalist Jean-Pierre Elkabbach, Taisez-vous Elkabbach (\\"Shut up, Elkabbach!\\"), which was not actually ever said by Marchais (it was said by Pierre Douglas while imitating Marchais to Thierry Le Luron, who was himself imitating Raymond Barre). During his TV performances, which stayed in the memory of French audiences, his tone with journalists and opponents was aggressive and humorous. For instance, questioned by Elkabbach and Alain Duhamel about his economic propositions, he answered: \\"you are privileged, you hold many jobs and make good salaries (in TV, radio, papers...), probably you are concerned by my proposition for a wealth tax, I understand why you don't want the change!\\" Works * Les Communistes et les Paysans ‚Äì \\"The Communists and Peasantry\\" (1972) * Le d√©fi d√©mocratique ‚Äì \\"The Challenge of Democracy\\" (1973) * La politique du PCF ‚Äì \\"PCF Policies\\" (1974) * Communistes et/ou chr√©tiens ‚Äì \\"Communists and/or Christians\\" (1977) * Parlons franchement ‚Äì \\"Let's Be Frank\\" (1977) * R√©ponses ‚Äì \\"Answers\\" (1977) * L'espoir au pr√©sent ‚Äì \\"Hope in the Present\\" (1980) * D√©mocratie ‚Äì \\"Democracy\\" (1990) NotesBibliography *Brown, Bernard (1974).

The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the Communist hammer and sickle with an outline map of Belarus.

Symbolism The elements that comprise the state emblem are not tied to any \\"official\\" symbolism. The design of the emblem of the Byelorussian SSR was used as the basis for the current Belarusian emblem; the primary difference between the two is that the Byelorussian SSR emblem contains more references to Communism, such as the Communist symbol of hammer and sickle and pure red ribbon with Communist mottoes, which the modern emblem does not, replaced with the outline and the flag of Belarus, respectively, however it still retains the communist red star, the red ribbon (albeit without the mottoes), the globe and the wheat bundles, which are also typical of Soviet emblems and still is very Soviet in nature. Legislation Belarusian passport bearing the state emblem on the left. 2009 The current law regulating the design and use of the Belarusian emblem was passed on July 5, 2004. Article 9 of Chapter 3 of Law No. 301-3 begins by describing the official drawing of the Belarusian arms and regulates on its proper design. Officially, the arms can be drawn in full colour, monochrome or using two colors. Article 10 states that the national emblem must be displayed at specified locations on a continual basis, such as the residences of the Belarusian leader, the chamber of the National Assembly and at governmental offices of national and regional levels. The emblem can also be used on documents issued by the government, including money, passports and official letterheads. The law also restricts the use of the emblem in other contexts‚Äîe.g. cities, towns or oblasts may not adopt a coat of arms or emblem using the national emblem either completely or in part. Furthermore, organizations not listed in the Law on State Symbols may only use the emblem by permission. The emblem can be used by both foreigners and citizens of Belarus, as long as the symbol is displayed with respect, although citizens may not use the state emblem on letterheads or business cards if they are not agents of the government.

History=Pahonia The Pahonia was used as an official coat of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1366 after being first used as the personal arms of Algirdas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania. The arms continued to be used until Grand Duchy of Lithuania were annexed by the Russian Empire in 1795, though the arms was incorporated into the Imperial coat of arms. The idea of return to the historic national symbol was pursued by Belarusian poet Maksim Bahdanoviƒç in his poem \\"Pahonia\\". The arms was again used in 1918 when the short-lived Belarusian People's Republic used the Pahonia as its emblem. More recently, the Pahonia was the official coat of arms starting in 1991, when Belarus declared itself independent of the Soviet Union. It was replaced by the current emblem following a controversial referendum held in 1995. Since it was dropped as the official emblem of Belarus, opposition groups such as the Belarusian People's Front have used the Pahonia as part of their own party symbols or used them as a form of protest against Belarusian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka.

Early life Nicholas was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1744, the youngest of three, to Anthony and Mary (Shute Cowman) Nicholas. His father was a blacksmith. and his uncle was Attwood Shute, the Mayor of Philadelphia (1756‚Äì1758). Nicholas was educated at the Academy and College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania), Class of 1759, (see http://destroyerhistory.org/fletcherclass/ns_nicholas/) and was a Freemason who belonged to a Masonic Lodge that met at Tun Tavern. Military service Historic Marine Corps portrait of Nicholas. On 28 November 1775, Nicholas was commissioned a \\"Captain of Marines\\" by the Second Continental Congress,Destroyer History Foundation biography. which was the first commission issued in the Continental Naval Service.Marine Corps biography. Photograph of commission, signed by John Hancock. 18 days after the Continental Congress resolved on 10 November 1775, \\"That two battalions of Marines be raised consisting of one Colonel, two Lieutenant-Colonels, two Majors, and other officers, as usual in other regiments; that they consist of an equal number of Privates with other battalions; that particular care be taken that no persons be appointed to offices, or enlisted into said battalions, but such as are good seamen, or so acquainted with maritime affairs as to be able to serve by sea when required; that they be enlisted and commissioned to serve for and during the present war with Great Britain and the Colonies, unless dismissed by order of Congress; that they be distinguished by the names of the First and Second Battalion of Marines.\\" Captain Nicholas no sooner received official confirmation of his appointment to office than he established recruiting headquarters in Philadelphia. By January 1776, having recruited a sufficient number of Marines for the vessels that comprised the Continental Navy in the waters of Philadelphia, Capt. Nicholas assumed command of the Marine Detachment on board the Alfred. With Commodore Esek Hopkins in command, the Alfred set sail from Philadelphia on the morning of 4 January 1776. The following month witnessed the baptismal fire of the Marines. Battle of Nassau Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, had collected a store of arms and provisions at New Providence, in the Bahamas. Dunmore's forces had done a great deal of injury along the Colonial coast, especially the shore of Virginia. Commodore Hopkins had been ordered to proceed to Abaco in the Bahamas, and from there to operate against the forces of Lord Dunmore. Commodore Hopkins decided to make an attack on New Providence, capture the enemy's stores, and destroy his supplies. Capt Nicholas was placed in command of the landing party of 234 Marines.http://www.marines.com/history-heritage/timeline This attack,the first successful landing engaged in by Continental Marines, saw the capture of Nassau on 3 March 1776 without a fight. On 6 April 1776, the Marines participated in the first naval battle between an American squadron and a British warship, when HMS Glasgow came upon the squadron. Promoted to Major On 25 June 1776, Congress placed Nicholas \\"at the head of the Marines with the rank of Major\\". Accordingly, Commodore Hopkins was advised to send Major Nicholas to Philadelphia, with dispatches for the Continental Congress. With notification of his promotion he was ordered to report to the Marine Committee. The Committee detached him from the Alfred and ordered him to remain in the city, \\"to discipline four companies of Marines and prepare them for service as Marine guards for the frigates on the stocks\\". Having recruited and thoroughly organised the companies, he requested arms and equipment for them. 1776‚Äì1779 In December 1776, Major Nicholas wrote to Congress: \\"The enemy having overrun the Jerseys, and our army being greatly reduced, I was ordered to march with three of the companies to be under the command of His Excellency, the Commander-in-Chief.\\" This was the first example of a battalion of Marines about to serve as an actual fighting unit under the direct command of Army authority. The Marines did not, however, engage in the attack on Trenton, on 26 December 1776, which followed General George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River. They were attached to General John Cadwalader's division, which was ordered to cross the Delaware to Burlington, New Jersey, south of Trenton, in concert with Washington's crossing to the north on the night of 25 December 1776, but was turned back due to ice floes on the river. After the first Battle of Trenton, the battalion of Marines under the command of Maj. Nicholas participated in a battle with a detachment of Cornwallis's main army at Princeton, New Jersey. During the ensuing months, Nicholas's battalion served both as infantry and artillery, participating in several skirmishes. Following the British evacuation of Philadelphia in June 1778, the Marine Barracks were reestablished and recruiting resumed. From then until the close of the war, Nicholas's duties at Philadelphia were similar to those of later Commandants. Moreover, he was actively in charge of recruiting, and at times acted as Muster Master of the Navy. On 20 November 1779, Nicholas wrote Congress to request he be put in charge of the Marine Detachment aboard the 74-gun ship of the line America, then being constructed in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. However, Congress was firm in its intention that Nicholas remain in Philadelphia. Upon her completion, the America was presented to France as a gift. Return to civilian life After the Navy and Continental Marines were disbanded following the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, Nicholas returned to civilian life and became an original member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati. He died on 27 August 1790, in Philadelphia during an epidemic of yellow fever and is buried in the Friends Graveyard at Arch Street Friends Meeting House. Legacy Three ships in the United States Navy have been named the USS Nicholas in his honor. On 10 November of each year, the date celebrated as the Marine Corps' birthday, Nicholas's grave in the Arch Street Friends Meeting graveyard in Philadelphia is marked with a wreath at dawn by a detachment of Marines. A British 6-pounder cannon, captured by Major Nicholas' Marines at Nassau, is on display at Fort Phoenix in Fairhaven, Massachusetts.

Definition Let K be a field and L a finite extension (and hence an algebraic extension) of K. L can be viewed as a vector space over K. Multiplication by Œ±, an element of L, :m_\\\\alpha:L\\\\to L \\\\text{ given by } m_\\\\alpha (x) = \\\\alpha x, is a K-linear transformation of this vector space into itself. The trace, TrL/K(Œ±), is defined as the (linear algebra) trace of this linear transformation. For Œ± in L, let œÉ(Œ±), ..., œÉ(Œ±) be the roots (counted with multiplicity) of the minimal polynomial of Œ± over K (in some extension field of K), then :\\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(\\\\alpha)=[L:K(\\\\alpha)]\\\\sum_{j=1}^n\\\\sigma_j(\\\\alpha). If L/K is separable then each root appears only once (however this does not mean the coefficient above is one; for example if Œ± is the identity element 1 of K then the trace is [L:K] times 1). More particularly, if L/K is a Galois extension and Œ± is in L, then the trace of Œ± is the sum of all the Galois conjugates of Œ±, i.e., :\\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(\\\\alpha)=\\\\sum_{g\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)}g(\\\\alpha), where Gal(L/K) denotes the Galois group of L/K. Example Let L = \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d}) be a quadratic extension of \\\\mathbb{Q}. Then a basis of L/\\\\mathbb{Q} \\\\text{ is }{1, \\\\sqrt{d}}. If \\\\alpha = a + b\\\\sqrt{d} then the matrix of m_{\\\\alpha} is: :\\\\left [ \\\\begin{matrix} a & bd \\\\ b & a \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right ], and so, \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/\\\\mathbb{Q}}(\\\\alpha) = [L:\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\alpha)]\\\\left( \\\\sigma_1(\\\\alpha) + \\\\sigma_2(\\\\alpha)\\\\right) = 1\\\\times \\\\left( \\\\sigma_1(\\\\alpha) + \\\\overline{\\\\sigma_1}(\\\\alpha)\\\\right) = a+b\\\\sqrt{d} + a-b\\\\sqrt{d} = 2a. The minimal polynomial of Œ± is . Properties of the trace Several properties of the trace function hold for any finite extension. The trace is a K-linear map (a K-linear functional), that is :\\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(\\\\alpha a + \\\\beta b) = \\\\alpha \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(a)+ \\\\beta \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(b) \\\\text{ for all }\\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\in K. If then \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(\\\\alpha) = [L:K] \\\\alpha. Additionally, trace behaves well in towers of fields: if M is a finite extension of L, then the trace from M to K is just the composition of the trace from M to L with the trace from L to K, i.e. :\\\\operatorname{Tr}_{M/K}=\\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}\\\\circ\\\\operatorname{Tr}_{M/L}. Finite fields Let L = GF(qn) be a finite extension of a finite field K = GF(q). Since L/K is a Galois extension, if Œ± is in L, then the trace of Œ± is the sum of all the Galois conjugates of Œ±, i.e. :\\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(\\\\alpha)=\\\\alpha + \\\\alpha^q + \\\\cdots + \\\\alpha^{q^{n-1}}. In this setting we have the additional properties, * \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(a^q) = \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(a) \\\\text{ for } a \\\\in L * \\\\text{for any }\\\\alpha \\\\in K, \\\\text{ we have }{b \\\\in L \\\\colon \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(b) = \\\\alpha } = q^{n-1} Theorem. For b ‚àà L, let Fb be the map a \\\\mapsto \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{L/K}(ba). Then if . Moreover, the K-linear transformations from L to K are exactly the maps of the form Fb as b varies over the field L. When K is the prime subfield of L, the trace is called the absolute trace and otherwise it is a relative trace. Application A quadratic equation, , with , and coefficients in the finite field \\\\operatorname{GF}(q) = \\\\mathbb{F}_q has either 0, 1 or 2 roots in GF(q) (and two roots, counted with multiplicity, in the quadratic extension GF(q2)). If the characteristic of GF(q) is odd, the discriminant, indicates the number of roots in GF(q) and the classical quadratic formula gives the roots. However, when GF(q) has even characteristic (i.e., for some positive integer h), these formulas are no longer applicable. Consider the quadratic equation with coefficients in the finite field GF(2h). If b = 0 then this equation has the unique solution x = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{c}{a}} in GF(q). If then the substitution converts the quadratic equation to the form: :y^2 + y + \\\\delta = 0, \\\\text { where } \\\\delta = \\\\frac{ac}{b^2}. This equation has two solutions in GF(q) if and only if the absolute trace \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{GF(q)/GF(2)}(\\\\delta) = 0. In this case, if is one of the solutions, then is the other. Let k be any element of GF(q) with \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{GF(q)/GF(2)}(k) = 1. Then a solution to the equation is given by: : y = s = k \\\\delta^2 + (k + k^2)\\\\delta^4 + \\\\ldots + (k + k^2 + \\\\ldots + k^{2^{h-2}})\\\\delta^{2^{h-1}}. When h = 2m + 1, a solution is given by the simpler expression: : y = s = \\\\delta + \\\\delta^{2^2} + \\\\delta^{2^4} + \\\\ldots + \\\\delta^{2^{2m}}. Trace form When L/K is separable, the trace provides a duality theory via the trace form: the map from to K sending to Tr(xy) is a nondegenerate, symmetric, bilinear form called the trace form. An example of where this is used is in algebraic number theory in the theory of the different ideal. The trace form for a finite degree field extension L/K has non-negative signature for any field ordering of K. The converse, that every Witt equivalence class with non-negative signature contains a trace form, is true for algebraic number fields K.Lorenz (2008) p.38 If L/K is an inseparable extension, then the trace form is identically 0. as footnoted in See also * Field norm * Reduced trace NotesReferences   * Further reading * * Section VI.5 of Category:Field (mathematics) ","title":"Field trace"},{"id":"457106","text":"Juho Pietari \\"Hannes\\" Kolehmainen (; 9 December 1889 ‚Äì 11 January 1966) was a Finnish four-time Olympic Gold medalist and a world record holder in middle- and long-distance running. He was the first in a generation of great Finnish long-distance runners, often named the \\"Flying Finns\\". Kolehmainen competed for a number of years in the United States, wearing the Winged Fist of the Irish American Athletic Club. He also enlisted in the 14th Regiment of the National Guard of New York, and became a U.S. citizen in 1921. Biography Kolehmainen, a devoted vegetarian and bricklayer by trade, was from a sportive family from Kuopio ‚Äì his brothers William and Tatu were also strong long- distance runners. Tatu competed in two Olympics and finished 10th in the Marathon in 1920. Hannes was one of the stars of the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, winning three gold medals. His most memorable was the one in the 5000 m. In that event, he ran a heroic duel with Frenchman Jean Bouin. After leading the field together for most of the race, Bouin was only defeated by Kolehmainen in the final metres, in world record time. In addition, Kolehmainen won the 10000 m and the now discontinued cross country event. With the Finnish team, he also obtained a silver place in the cross country team event. Kolehmainen's sportive career was interrupted by the First World War, but he remained an athlete to be reckoned with, although his specialty had now shifted to the longer distances, especially the marathon. At the first post- war Olympics in Antwerp, he won the gold medal in this event. He would also enter the Olympic marathon in 1924, but did not complete that race. By then, Kolehmainen had found a worthy successor in Paavo Nurmi. Together with Nurmi, as the final link in the torch relay, he lit the Olympic Flame at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He died in that same city, fourteen years later.

Animals communicate by using a variety of signs such as sounds or movements. Such signing may be considered complex enough to be called a form of language if the inventory of signs is large, the signs are relatively arbitrary, and the animals seem to produce them with a degree of volition (as opposed to relatively automatic conditioned behaviors or unconditioned instincts, usually including facial expressions). In experimental tests, animal communication may also be evidenced through the use of lexigrams (as used by chimpanzees and bonobos). While the term \\"animal language\\" is widely used, researchers agree that animal languages are not as complex or expressive as human language. Many researchers argue that animal communication lacks a key aspect of human language, that is, the creation of new patterns of signs under varied circumstances. (In contrast, for example, humans routinely produce entirely new combinations of words.) Some researchers, including the linguist Charles Hockett, argue that human language and animal communication differ so much that the underlying principles are unrelated. Accordingly, linguist Thomas A. Sebeok has proposed to not use the term \\"language\\" for animal sign systems. Marc Hauser, Noam Chomsky, and W. Tecumseh Fitch assert an evolutionary continuum exists between the communication methods of animal and human language. Aspects of human language Human and chimp, in this case Claudine Andr√© with a bonobo. The following properties of human language have been argued to separate it from animal communication: *Arbitrariness: there is usually no rational relationship between a sound or sign and its meaning. For example, there is nothing intrinsically house-like about the word \\"house\\". *Discreteness: language is composed of small, repeatable parts (discrete units) that are used in combination to create meaning. *Displacement: languages can be used to communicate ideas about things that are not in the immediate vicinity either spatially or temporally. *Duality of patterning: the smallest meaningful units (words, morphemes) consist of sequences of units without meaning. This is also referred to as double articulation. *Productivity: users can understand and create an indefinitely large number of utterances. *Semanticity: specific signals have specific meanings. Research with apes, like that of Francine Patterson with Koko (gorilla) or Allen and Beatrix Gardner with Washoe (chimpanzee), suggested that apes are capable of using language that meets some of these requirements such as arbitrariness, discreteness, and productivity. In the wild, chimpanzees have been seen \\"talking\\" to each other when warning about approaching danger. For example, if one chimpanzee sees a snake, he makes a low, rumbling noise, signaling for all the other chimps to climb into nearby trees. In this case, the chimpanzees' communication does not indicate displacement, as it is entirely contained to an observable event. Arbitrariness has been noted in meerkat calls; bee dances demonstrate elements of spatial displacement; and cultural transmission has possibly occurred between the celebrated bonobos Kanzi and Panbanisha. Human language may not be completely \\"arbitrary.\\" Research has shown that almost all humans naturally demonstrate limited crossmodal perception (e.g. synesthesia) and multisensory integration, as illustrated by the Kiki and Booba study. Other recent research has tried to explain how the structure of human language emerged, comparing two different aspects of hierarchical structure present in animal communication and proposing that human language arose out of these two separate systems. Claims that animals have language skills akin to humans however, are extremely controversial. As Steven Pinker illustrates in his book The Language Instinct, claims that chimpanzees can acquire language are exaggerated and rest on very limited or specious data. The American linguist Charles Hockett theorized that there are sixteen features of human language that distinguished human communication from that of animals. He called these the design features of language. The features mentioned below have so far been found in all spoken human languages and at least one is missing from all other animal communication systems. * Vocal-auditory channel: sounds emitted from the mouth and perceived by the auditory system. This applies to many animal communication systems, but there are many exceptions. Ex. An alternative to vocal-auditory communication is visual communication. An example is cobras extending the ribs behind their heads to send the message of intimidation or of feeling threatened. In humans, sign languages provide many examples of fully formed languages that use a visual channel. * Broadcast transmission and directional reception: this requires that the recipient can tell the direction that the signal comes from and thus the originator of the signal. * Rapid fading (transitory nature): Signal lasts a short time. This is true of all systems involving sound. It does not take into account audio recording technology and is also not true for written language. It tends not to apply to animal signals involving chemicals and smells which often fade slowly. For example, a skunk's smell, produced in its glands, lingers to deter a predator from attacking. * Interchangeability: All utterances that are understood can be produced. This is different from some communication systems where, for example, males produce one set of behaviours and females another and they are unable to interchange these messages so that males use the female signal and vice versa. For example, Heliothine moths have differentiated communication: females are able to send a chemical to indicate preparedness to mate, while males cannot send the chemical. * Total feedback: The sender of a message is aware of the message being sent. * Specialization: The signal produced is intended for communication and is not due to another behavior. For example, dog panting is a natural reaction to being overheated, but is not produced to specifically relay a particular message. * Semanticity: There is some fixed relationship between a signal and a meaning. Primate: studied examples Humans are able to distinguish real words from fake words based on the phonological order of the word itself. In a 2013 study, baboons have been shown to have this skill, as well. The discovery has led researchers to believe that reading is not as advanced a skill as previously believed, but instead based on the ability to recognize and distinguish letters from one another. The experimental setup consisted of six young adult baboons, and results were measured by allowing the animals to use a touch screen and selecting whether or not the displayed word was indeed a real word, or a nonword such as \\"dran\\" or \\"telk.\\" The study lasted for six weeks, with approximately 50,000 tests completed in that time. The experimenters explain the use of bigrams, which are combinations of two (usually different) letters. They tell us that the bigrams used in nonwords are rare, while the bigrams used in real words are more common. Further studies will attempt to teach baboons how to use an artificial alphabet. In a 2016 study, a team of biologists from several universities concluded that macaques possess vocal tracts physically capable of speech, \\"but lack a speech-ready brain to control it\\". Non-primates: studied examples Among the most studied examples of animal languages are: Birds * Bird songs: Songbirds can be very articulate. Grey parrots are famous for their ability to mimic human language, and at least one specimen, Alex, appeared able to answer a number of simple questions about objects he was presented with. Parrots, hummingbirds and songbirds ‚Äì display vocal learning patterns. Insects * Bee dance: Used to communicate direction and distance of food source in many species of bees. Mammals * African forest elephants: Cornell University's Elephant Listening Project began in 1999 when Katy Payne began studying the calls of African forest elephants in Dzanga National Park in the Central African Republic. Andrea Turkalo has continued Payne's work in Dzanga National Park observing elephant communication. For nearly 20 years, Turkalo has spent the majority of her time using a spectrogram to record the noises that the elephants make. After extensive observation and research, she has been able to recognize elephants by their voices. Researchers hope to translate these voices into an elephant dictionary, but that will likely not occur for many years. Because elephant calls are often made at very low frequencies, this spectrogram is able to detect lower frequencies that human ears are unable to hear, allowing Turkalo to get a better idea of what she perceives the elephants to be saying. Cornell's research on African forest elephants has challenged the idea that humans are considerably better at using language and that animals only have a small repertoire of information that they can convey to others. As Turkalo explained on 60 Minutes' \\"The Secret Language of Elephants,\\" \\"Many of their calls are in some ways similar to human speech.\\" *Mustached bats: Since these animals spend most of their lives in the dark, they rely heavily on their auditory system to communicate. This acoustic communication includes echolocation or using calls to locate each other in the darkness. Studies have shown that mustached bats use a wide variety of calls to communicate with one another. These calls include 33 different sounds, or \\"syllables,\\" that the bats then either use alone or combine in various ways to form \\"composite\\" syllables. * Prairie dogs: Dr. Con Slobodchikoff studied prairie dog communication and discovered: **different alarm calls for different species of predators; **different escape behaviors for different species of predators; **transmission of semantic information, in that playbacks of alarm calls in the absence of predators lead to escape behaviors that are appropriate to the type of predator which elicited the alarm calls; ** alarm calls containing descriptive information about the general size, color, and speed of travel of the predator. =Aquatic mammals= *Bottlenose dolphins: Dolphins can hear one another up to 6 miles apart underwater. In one National Geographic article, the success of a mother dolphin communicating with her baby using a telephone was outlined. Researchers noted that it appeared that both dolphins knew who they were speaking with and what they were speaking about. Not only do dolphins communicate via nonverbal cues, but they also seem to chatter and respond to other dolphin's vocalizations. Spectrogram of humpback whale vocalizations. Detail is shown for the first 24 seconds of the 37 second recording humpback whale \\"song\\". The ethereal whale \\"songs\\" and echolocation \\"clicks\\" are visible as horizontal striations and vertical sweeps respectively. * Whales: Two groups of whales, the humpback whale and a subspecies of blue whale found in the Indian Ocean, are known to produce repetitious sounds at varying frequencies known as whale song. Male humpback whales perform these vocalizations only during the mating season, and so it is surmised the purpose of songs is to aid sexual selection. Humpbacks also make a sound called a feeding call, five to ten seconds in length of near constant frequency. Humpbacks generally feed cooperatively by gathering in groups, swimming underneath shoals of fish and all lunging up vertically through the fish and out of the water together. Prior to these lunges, whales make their feeding call. The exact purpose of the call is not known, but research suggests that fish react to it. When the sound was played back to them, a group of herring responded to the sound by moving away from the call, even though no whale was present. *Sea lions: Beginning in 1971 and continuing until present day, Dr. Ronald J. Schusterman and his research associates have studied sea lions' cognitive ability. They have discovered that sea lions are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made with their peers, rather than only the stimuli's common features. This is called \\"equivalence classification\\". This ability to recognize equivalence may be a precursor to language. Research is currently being conducted at the Pinniped Cognition & Sensory Systems Laboratory to determine how sea lions form these equivalence relationships. Sea lions have also been proven to be able to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language similar to the one used with primates.http://www.pinnipedlab.org/ The Pinniped Cognition & Sensory Systems Laboratory The sea lions studied were able to learn and use a number of syntactic relations between the signs they were taught, such as how the signs should be arranged in relation to each other. However, the sea lions rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In the wild it's thought that sea lions use the reasoning skills associated with equivalence classification in order to make important decisions that can affect their rate of survival (e.g. recognizing friends and family or avoiding enemies and predators). Sea lions use the following to display their language: ** Sea lions use their bodies in various postural positions to display communication. ** Sea lion's vocal cords limit their ability to convey sounds to a range of barks, chirps, clicks, moans, growls and squeaks. ** There has yet to be an experiment which proves for certain that sea lions use echolocation as a means of communication. The effects of learning on auditory signaling in these animals is of special interest. Several investigators have pointed out that some marine mammals appear to have an extraordinary capacity to alter both the contextual and structural features of their vocalizations as a result of experience. Janik and Slater (2000) have stated that learning can modify the emission of vocalizations in one of two ways: (1) by influencing the context in which a particular signal is used and/or (2) by altering the acoustic structure of the call itself. Male California sea lions can learn to inhibit their barking in the presence of any male dominant to them, but vocalize normally when dominant males are absent. Recent work on gray seals show different call types can be selectively conditioned and placed under biased control of different cues (Schusterman, in press) and the use of food reinforcement can also modify vocal emissions. \\"Hoover\\", a captive male harbor seal demonstrated a convincing case of vocal mimicry. However similar observations have not been reported since. Still shows under the right circumstances pinnipeds may use auditory experience, in addition to environmental consequences such as food reinforcement and social feedback to modify their vocal emissions. In a 1992 study, Robert Gisiner and Ronald J. Schusterman conducted experiments in which they attempted to teach Rocky, a female California sea lion, syntax. Rocky was taught signed words, then she was asked to perform various tasks dependent on word order after viewing a signed instruction. It was found that Rocky was able to determine relations between signs and words, and form a basic form of syntax. A 1993 study by Ronald J Schusterman and David Kastak found that the California sea lion was capable of understanding abstract concepts such as symmetry, sameness and transitivity. This provides a strong backing to the theory that equivalence relations can form without language. The distinctive sound of sea lions is produced both above and below water. To mark territory, sea lions \\"bark\\", with non-alpha males making more noise than alphas. Although females also bark, they do so less frequently and most often in connection with birthing pups or caring for their young. Females produce a highly directional bawling vocalization, the pup attraction call, which helps mother and pup locate one another. As noted in Animal Behavior, their amphibious lifestyle has made them need acoustic communication for social organization while on land. Sea lions can hear frequencies as low as 100 Hz and as high as 40,000 Hz and vocalize between the ranges of 100 to 10,000 Hz. Mollusks * Caribbean reef squid have been shown to communicate using a variety of color, shape, and texture changes. Squid are capable of rapid changes in skin color and pattern through nervous control of chromatophores. In addition to camouflage and appearing larger in the face of a threat, squids use color, patterns, and flashing to communicate with one another in various courtship rituals. Caribbean reef squid can send one message via color patterns to a squid on their right, while they send another message to a squid on their left.Byrne, R.A., U. Griebel, J.B. Wood & J.A. Mather 2003. Berliner Geowissenschaftliche Abhandlungen 3: 29‚Äì35. Comparison of the terms \\"animal language\\" and \\"animal communication\\" It is worth distinguishing \\"animal language\\" from \\"animal communication\\", although there is some comparative interchange in certain cases (e.g. Cheney & Seyfarth's vervet monkey call studies). Thus \\"animal language\\" typically does not include bee dancing, bird song, whale song, dolphin signature whistles, prairie dogs, nor the communicative systems found in most social mammals. The features of language as listed above are a dated formulation by Hockett in 1960. Through this formulation Hockett made one of the earliest attempts to break down features of human language for the purpose of applying Darwinian gradualism. Although an influence on early animal language efforts (see below), is today not considered the key architecture at the core of \\"animal language\\" research. \\"Clever Hans\\", an Orlov Trotter horse that was claimed to have been able to perform arithmetic and other intellectual tasks. Animal Language results are controversial for several reasons. (For a related controversy, see also Clever Hans.) In the 1970s John Lilly was attempting to \\"break the code\\": to fully communicate ideas and concepts with wild populations of dolphins so that we could \\"speak\\" to them, and share our cultures, histories, and more. This effort failed. Early chimpanzee work was with chimpanzee infants raised as if they were human; a test of the nature vs. nurture hypothesis. Chimpanzees have a laryngeal structure very different from that of humans, and it has been suggested that chimpanzees are not capable of voluntary control of their breathing, although better studies are needed to accurately confirm this. This combination is thought to make it very difficult for the chimpanzees to reproduce the vocal intonations required for human language. Researchers eventually moved towards a gestural (sign language) modality, as well as \\"keyboard\\" devices laden with buttons adorned with symbols (known as \\"lexigrams\\") that the animals could press to produce artificial language. Other chimpanzees learned by observing human subjects performing the task. This latter group of researchers studying chimpanzee communication through symbol recognition (keyboard) as well as through the use of sign language (gestural), are on the forefront of communicative breakthroughs in the study of animal language, and they are familiar with their subjects on a first name basis: Sarah, Lana, Kanzi, Koko, Sherman, Austin and Chantek. Perhaps the best known critic of \\"Animal Language\\" is Herbert Terrace. Terrace's 1979 criticism using his own research with the chimpanzee Nim Chimpsky was scathing and basically spelled the end of animal language research in that era, most of which emphasized the production of language by animals. In short, he accused researchers of over-interpreting their results, especially as it is rarely parsimonious to ascribe true intentional \\"language production\\" when other simpler explanations for the behaviors (gestural hand signs) could be put forth. Also, his animals failed to show generalization of the concept of reference between the modalities of comprehension and production; this generalization is one of many fundamental ones that are trivial for human language use. The simpler explanation according to Terrace was that the animals had learned a sophisticated series of context-based behavioral strategies to obtain either primary (food) or social reinforcement, behaviors that could be over-interpreted as language use. In 1984 during this anti-Animal Language backlash, Louis Herman published an account of artificial language in the bottlenosed dolphin in the journal Cognition. A major difference between Herman's work and previous research was his emphasis on a method of studying language comprehension only (rather than language comprehension and production by the animal(s)), which enabled rigorous controls and statistical tests, largely because he was limiting his researchers to evaluating the animals' physical behaviors (in response to sentences) with blinded observers, rather than attempting to interpret possible language utterances or productions. The dolphins' names here were Akeakamai and Phoenix. Irene Pepperberg used the vocal modality for language production and comprehension in a grey parrot named Alex in the verbal mode, and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh continues to study bonobos such as Kanzi and Panbanisha. R. Schusterman duplicated many of the dolphin results in his California sea lions (\\"Rocky\\"), and came from a more behaviorist tradition than Herman's cognitive approach. Schusterman's emphasis is on the importance on a learning structure known as \\"equivalence classes.\\" However, overall, there has not been any meaningful dialog between the linguistics and animal language spheres, despite capturing the public's imagination in the popular press. Also, the growing field of language evolution is another source of future interchange between these disciplines. Most primate researchers tend to show a bias toward a shared pre-linguistic ability between humans and chimpanzees, dating back to a common ancestor, while dolphin and parrot researchers stress the general cognitive principles underlying these abilities. More recent related controversies regarding animal abilities include the closely linked areas of Theory of mind, Imitation (e.g. Nehaniv & Dautenhahn, 2002), Animal Culture (e.g. Rendell & Whitehead, 2001),* and Language Evolution (e.g. Christiansen & Kirby, 2003). There has been a recent emergence in animal language research which has contested the idea that animal communication is less sophisticated than human communication. Denise Herzing has done research on dolphins in the Bahamas whereby she created a two-way conversation via a submerged keyboard. The keyboard allows divers to communicate with wild dolphins. By using sounds and symbols on each key the dolphins could either press the key with their nose or mimic the whistling sound emitted in order to ask humans for a specific prop. This ongoing experiment has shown that in non-linguistic creatures brilliant and rapid thinking does occur despite our previous conceptions of animal communication. Further research done with Kanzi using lexigrams has strengthened the idea that animal communication is much more complex then we once thought.

He wrote a geographical compendium known as KitƒÅb al-A‚ÄòlƒÅq al-Nafƒ´sa (, Book of Precious Records). The information on his home town of Isfahan is especially extensive and valuable. Ibn Rustah states that, while for other lands he had to depend on second-hand reports, often acquired with great difficulty and with no means of checking their veracity, for Isfahan he could use his own experience and observations or statements from others known to be reliable. Thus we have a description of the twenty districts (rostaqs) of Isfahan containing details not found in other geographers' works. Concerning the town itself, we learn that it was perfectly circular in shape, with a circumference of half a farsang, walls defended by a hundred towers, and four gates.  Recorded information  His information on the non-Islamic peoples of Europe and Inner Asia makes him a useful source for these obscure regions (he was even aware of the existence of the British Isles and of the Heptarchy of Anglo-Saxon England) and for the prehistory of the Turks and other steppe peoples. He traveled to Novgorod with the Rus' and compiled books relating his own travels, as well as second-hand knowledge of the Khazars, Magyars, Slavs, Bulgars and other peoples. * He wrote of a 10th-century city of the Rus': ::\\"As for the Rus, they live on an island ‚Ä¶ that takes three days to walk round and is covered with thick undergrowth and forests; ‚Ä¶ They harry the Slavs, using ships to reach them; they carry them off as slaves and ‚Ä¶ sell them. They have no fields but simply live on what they get from the Slav's lands ‚Ä¶ When a son is born, the father will go up to the newborn baby, sword in hand; throwing it down, he says, 'I shall not leave you with any property: You have only what you can provide with this weapon.'\\"National Geographic, March 1985. :His impression of the Rus' seemed to be very favorable: ::\\"They carry clean clothes and the men adorn themselves with bracelets and gold. They treat their slaves well and also they carry exquisite clothes, because they put great effort in trade. They have many towns. They have a most friendly attitude towards foreigners and strangers who seek refuge.\\" :This is in contrast to the account of Ibn Fadlan and other Arab authors, whose views on hygiene (based on Islamic hygienical jurisprudence) contrasted with that of the Rus'. However, the word clean initially appeared in the first Russian translation of Ibn Rustah by professor Daniel Chwolson (who also misspelled his name as Ibn Dasta(h)). Consecutive Russian editions of Chwolson's translation include a footnote saying that the Arabic original clearly says the opposite, unclean or impure, and suggesting that Chwolson made such a correction intentionally, out of a remote concern that modern Russians might be offended by such characteristic.See footnote 35. * Of ancient Croatia he wrote in the chronicle Al-Djarmi: ::\\"Their ruler is crowned ‚Ä¶ He dwells in the midst of the Slavs ‚Ä¶ He bears the title of 'ruler of rulers' and is called 'sacred king'. He is more powerful than the Zupan (viceroy), who is his deputy ‚Ä¶ His capital is called Drzvab where is held a fair of three days every month.\\" * About a certain king of the Caucasus Ibn Rustah wrote: ::\\"He prayed on Fridays with the Muslims, on Saturdays with the Jews and on Sundays with the Christians. 'Since each religion claims that it is the only true one and that the others are invalid', the king explained, 'I have decided to hedge my bets.'\\" * He also travelled extensively in Arabia and is one of the early Persian explorers to describe the city of Sana'a. In his Book of Precious Records, he writes: ::\\"It is the city of Yemen -- there not being found in the highland or the Tihama or the Hijaz a city greater, more populous or more prosperous, of more noble origin or more delicious food than it. ‚Ä¶ San'a is a populous city with fine dwellings, some above others, but most of them are decorated with plaster, burned bricks and dressed stones.\\" Translations –ê–±—É-–ê–ª–∏ –ê—Ö–º–µ–¥ –ë–µ–Ω –û–º–∞—Ä –ò–±–Ω-–î–∞—Å—Ç–∞. –ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è –æ —Ö–æ–∑–∞—Ä–∞—Ö, –±—É—Ä—Ç–∞—Å–∞—Ö, –±–æ–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∞—Ö, –º–∞–¥—å—è—Ä–∞—Ö, —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω–∞—Ö –∏ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∞—Ö. ‚Äî –°–ü–±.: —Ç–∏–ø. –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏–∏ –ù–∞—É–∫, 1869.

Biography  In 1992, his first novel Yume no Ki ga Tsugeta nara (\\"If Only the Dream Trees Could Touch\\") appeared in Hayakawa Shobo (Tokyo)'s SF Magazine. His short story \\"Spice\\" won the Hayakawa AwardAnime on DVD Interview at Anime Expo 2002 By Andrew Tei in 1993. In 1996, he published his first long novel in three volumes, Seikai no Monshou (Seikai no Monsh≈ç/Crest of the Stars). In the next year 1997 Seikai no Monsho was awarded with Seiun AwardLoneStarCon2 The 55th World Science Fiction Convention Saturday, August 30, 1997 at the Japan SF Convention. He released its sequel Seikai no Senki (Banner of the Stars), where he said that Seikai no Monsho was actually an overture to Seikai no Senki. Morioka had already suggested in Seikai no Monshou 2 that the entire series should narrate the life of Princess Lamhirh (aka Lafiel), from her birth to her eventual ascension to the imperial throne. Five volumes of Seikai no Senki are now available, with Morioka naming the first three the \\"Diahoc Trilogy\\", but the series itself has not yet finished. An English translation of \\"Seikai no Monsh≈ç/Crest of the Stars\\" has been published by Tokyopop, which came out from the fall of 2006 to May 2007.

Biography Vandermonde was a violinist, and became engaged with mathematics only around 1770. In M√©moire sur la r√©solution des √©quations (1771) he reported on symmetric functions and solution of cyclotomic polynomials; this paper anticipated later Galois theory (see also abstract algebra for the role of Vandermonde in the genesis of group theory). In Remarques sur des probl√®mes de situation (1771) he studied knight's tours, and presaged the development of knot theory by explicitly noting the importance of topological features when discussing the properties of knots: \\"Whatever the twists and turns of a system of threads in space, one can always obtain an expression for the calculation of its dimensions, but this expression will be of little use in practice. The craftsman who fashions a braid, a net, or some knots will be concerned, not with questions of measurement, but with those of position: what he sees there is the manner in which the theads are interlaced\\" The same year he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. M√©moire sur des irrationnelles de diff√©rents ordres avec une application au cercle (1772) was on combinatorics, and M√©moire sur l'√©limination (1772) on the foundations of determinant theory.

Biography John Walker was born in 1805 near Kilmarnock in East Ayrshire, Scotland. When his father Alexander died in 1820 he was left ¬£417 in trust. In 1820 the trustees invested in an Italian warehouse, grocery, and wine and spirits shop on the High Street in Kilmarnock. In 1833 John married Elizabeth Purves. He was a respected businessman, leader of the local trade association, and a Freemason. His store's stock was almost entirely destroyed in an 1852 flood, but the business recovered within a couple of years. His own whisky brand, then known as \\"Walker's Kilmarnock Whisky\\" was popular locally, although John Walker himself was a teetotaler. John's son Alexander Walker (named after John's father) had apprenticed with a tea merchant in Glasgow, and there learned the art of blending tea. When he returned to take over the business from his ailing father, he used those skills to create Old Highland Whisky (eventually renamed Johnnie Walker Black Label), the blend that made Johnnie Walker whisky famous.

Structure The hamate is an irregularly shaped carpal bone found within the hand. The hamate is found within the distal row of carpal bones, and abuts the metacarpals of the little finger and ring finger. Adjacent to the hamate on the ulnar side, and slightly above it, is the pisiform bone. Adjacent on the radial side is the capitate, and proximal is the lunate. Surfaces The hamate bone has six surfaces: * The superior, the apex of the wedge, is narrow, convex, smooth, and articulates with the lunate. * The inferior articulates with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones, by concave facets which are separated by a ridge. * The dorsal is triangular and rough for ligamentous attachment. * The palmar presents, at its lower and ulnar side, a curved, hook-like process, the hamulus, directed forward and laterally. * The medial articulates with the triangular bone by an oblong facet, cut obliquely from above, downward and medialward. * The lateral articulates with the capitate by its upper and posterior part, the remaining portion being rough, for the attachment of ligaments. Hook Hamate bone of the left hand. Hamulus shown in red. The hook of hamate () is found at the proximal, ulnar side of the hamate bone. The hook is a curved, hook-like process that projects 1‚Äì2 mm distally and radially. The ulnar nerve hooks around the hook of hamate as it crosses towards the medial side of hand. The hook forms the ulnar border of the carpal tunnel, and the radial border for Guyon's canal. Numerous structures attach to it, including ligaments from the pisiform, the transverse carpal ligament, and the tendon of Flexor carpi ulnaris. Its medial surface to the flexor digiti minimi brevis and opponens digiti minimi; its lateral side is grooved for the passage of the flexor tendons into the palm of the hand. Development The ossification of the hamate starts between 1 and 12 months. The hamate does not fully ossify until about the 15th year of life. In animals The bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with the \\"fourth distal carpal\\" of reptiles and amphibians. Function The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. Clinical significance The hamate bone is the bone most commonly fractured when a golfer hits the ground hard with a golf club on the downswing or a hockey player hits the ice with a slap shot. The fracture is usually a hairline fracture, commonly missed on normal X-rays. Symptoms are pain aggravated by gripping, tenderness over the hamate and symptoms of irritation of the ulnar nerve. This is characterized by numbness and weakness of the pinkie finger with partial involvement of the ring finger as well, the \\"ulnar 1¬Ω fingers\\". The hook of hamate is particularly prone to fracture-related complications such as non-union due to its tenuous blood supply. It is also a common injury in baseball players. Several professional baseball players have had the bone removed during the course of their careers. This condition has been called \\"Wilson's Wrist\\".WILSON JN. Profiles of the carpal canal. J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1954 Jan;36-A(1):127‚Äì132 The calcification of the unciform bone is seen on X-rays during puberty and is sometimes used in orthodontics to determine if an adolescent patient is suitable for orthognathic intervention (i.e. before or at their growth spurt).

Longton. The A50 passing through Frog Island, Leicester The A50 is a major trunk road in England between Warrington and Leicester; historically it was also a major route from London to Leicester. Route The current A50 runs south-east from Warrington via Junction 20 of the M6, Knutsford, Holmes Chapel, Kidsgrove and Stoke on Trent to Junction 24 of the M1 near Kegworth, via Derby's southern bypass. From there it is concurrent with the M1 until Junction 22, where it runs into the City of Leicester. The section from junctions 24a (in Lockington-Hemington) and 24 (in Kegworth) of the M1 is the former A6, and has not been widened. It has only three lanes westbound from junction 24a. The Stoke and Derby section was originally intended to be part of an M64 motorway. Proposed development In November 2013 it was reported that funding would be being made available for improvements to the section around Uttoxeter, with work starting no later than 2015/16. A few days earlier the MP was lobbying for the improvements, stating that improvements were needed to the traffic islands for safety reasons and to improve traffic flow. There are plans for 700 new houses to the west of Uttoxeter and to the south of the A50. History=The old A50 Prior to the opening of the M1, the A50 route was one of two main routes from London to the North West via Leicester, until it was replaced by what has become the A6 during the 19th century. A third route between London and Leicester was via the A5 to Old Stratford, A508 to Market Harborough and thence the A6. That route and the A50 route both passed through Northampton which was a significant calling point on many coaching routes until the arrival of the railway. Until the M1 opened, the A50 used to terminate at Hockliffe in Bedfordshire at a junction with the A5. When the M1 motorway opened alongside the old route south of Northampton it was down-classified as: * B526 between Northampton and the Newport Pagnell bypass. * A509 between the Newport Pagnell bypass and Junction 14 of the M1. * A5130 between Junction 14 and Woburn * A4012 between Woburn and Hockcliffe. From that point until the 1990s the southern point of the A50 was at a junction with the A508 in Kingsthorpe, Northampton. In the 1990s, with the opening of the A14 and to discourage traffic from using the road between Leicester and Northampton, the old route was re-designated as A5199 between Leicester and Northampton. At the same time the A50 became the A511 north of Leicester, between Burton upon Trent and Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Leicester when the dual carriageway section bypassing Derby was completed. The current route Part of the route mirrored the plans for the original M64 motorway, with three lanes in some sections ‚Äì notably between Kegworth and the A6 near Derby. The new A50 route was opened in stages between March 1985 and 1999, with using various temporary designations: *1985: ¬£16m Blythe Bridge - Uttoxeter section from the north- west) *1992: ¬£2.6m Etwall bypass, opened as the A516. *1995: ¬£30.4m Hatton, Hilton and Foston bypass, opened by John Watts as the A564. *1997 (June): ¬£52m section 1 of the Blythe Bridge to Queensway. *1997 (September): the ¬£109.5m Derby Southern Bypass, opened by Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman, Minister for Roads at the DETR as the A564. *1997 (September): The A6 Derby Spur. *1997 (November): the ¬£21m section 2 of the Blythe Bridge to Queensway *1998: ¬£20.6m Doveridge Bypass as the A564. *1999: the delayed A50/M1 junction 24a improvements. On completion, the Southern Derby Bypass was re-designated as the A50, being maintained privately by Connect A50 Ltd. Much of this new section of road is made of concrete. Incidents *On 15 April 2018 a police pursuit on the road ended in a collision between two cars near Longton, Stoke-on-Trent. A man was killed and three others were injured, one critically.

It is distinguished by its deep concavity and crescentic outline. It is situated in the center of the proximal row carpal bones, which lie between the ulna and radius and the hand. The lunate carpal bone is situated between the lateral scaphoid bone and medial triquetral bone. Structure The lunate is a crescent-shaped carpal bone found within the hand. The lunate is found within the proximal row of carpal bones. Proximally, it abuts the radius. Laterally, it articulates with the scaphoid, medially with the triquetral, and distally with the capitate. The lunate also articulates on its distal and medial surface with the hamate bone. The lunate is stabilised by a medial ligament to the scaphoid and a lateral ligament to the triquetrum. Ligaments between the radius and carpal bone also stabilise the position of the lunate, as does its position in the lunate fossa of the radius. Bone The proximal surface of the lunate bone is smooth and convex, articulating with the radius. The lateral surface is flat and narrow, with a crescentic facet for articulation with the scaphoid. The medial surface possesses a smooth and quadrilateral facet for articulation with the triquetral. The palmar surface is rough, as is the dorsal surface. The dorsal surface is broad and rounded. The distal surface of the bone is deep and concave. Blood supply The lunate receives its blood supply from dorsal and palmar branches. Variation The lunate has a variable shape. About one-third of lunate bones do not possess a medial facet, meaning they do not articulate with the hamate bone. Additionally, in about 20% of people, blood supply may arise from palmar vessels alone. Ossification The ossification of the lunate bone commences between 18 months and 4 years and 3 months. Function The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. As a proximal carpal bone, the lunate is also involved in movement of the wrist.  Clinical relevance  Perilunar dislocation as seen on x-ray. The lunate bone is the most frequently dislocated carpal bone. *Carpal coalition *Kienbock's disease *Teisen classification Etymology The name of the lunate bone derives from the \\"crescent-shaped\\" (), from Latin luna (\\"moon\\"), from the bone's resemblance to a crescent moon. In amphibians and reptiles, the bone is instead referred to as the intermedium, because of its position between the other two proximal carpals.

The eventual goal would be to establish mechanisms by which meditation induces changes in the activity of the brain, which in turn induces a state of mental clarity. For example, Austin presents evidence from EEG scans that deep relaxed breathing reduces brain activity. The publishers described their book as a \\"Comprehensive text on the evidence from neuroscience that helps to clarify which brain mechanisms underlie the subjective states of Zen, and employs Zen to 'illuminate' how the brain works in various states of consciousness\\".

The integration of the group was voluntary and happened within one to two generations. The settlers' children learned the Polish language. There were also many mixed marriages with Poles living in the area. At the end of the 19th century, during the Prussian fight against the influence of the Catholic church, all Catholics in villages inhabited by the settlers chose Polish nationality during Prussian and German censuses.

At this early stage in Dahrendorf's academic career, he took an interest in Marxist theory and wrote his PhD thesis on Karl Marx's theory of justice. Starting in the late 1950s, Dahrenforf, like Coser, argued for a \\"conflict theory approach to sociology.\\" He continued his academic research at London School of Economics under Karl Popper as a Leverhulme Research Scholar in 1953‚Äì1954, gaining a PhD degree in sociology in 1956. He was a professor of sociology in Hamburg (1957‚Äì1960), T√ºbingen (1960‚Äì1964) and Konstanz (1966‚Äì1969). From 1957 to 1959, Dahrendorf talked about \\"this ability to organize as the principle between quasi-groups and interest groups.\\" Quasi-groups are defined as \\"those collectives that have latent identical role interests but do not experience a sense of \\"belongingness\\". Interest groups, on the other hand, \\"have a structure, a form of organization, a program or goal, and a personnel of members.\\" In 1960, he became a visiting professor of Sociology at Columbia University in New York. From 1968 to 1969, Dahrendorf was a member of the Parliament of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, and also in 1968, his links with Harvard University began. Dahrendorf decided to become a member of the Bundestag in 1969 during the time when Brandt formed his first SPD-FDP coalition government. After joining, he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the foreign minister. Because he was placed third on the ladder of command in the foreign ministry, he did not enjoy the experience. From 1969 to 1970 he was a member of the German parliament for the Free Democratic Party (the German liberals). From 1969 to 1970 he was also a Parliamentary Secretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1970 he became a Commissioner in the European Commission in Brussels. He was dedicated to the EU as a guarantor of human rights and liberty. In 1974, the BBC invited him to present the annual Reith Lectures. In this series of six radio talks, entitled The New Liberty, he examined the definition of freedom. From 1974 to 1984, Dahrendorf was director of the London School of Economics, when he returned to Germany to become Professor of Social Science, Konstanz University (1984‚Äì86). From 1967 to 1970, he was Chairman of the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Soziologie), resigning it when he took up his office at Brussels. Between 1976 and 1979 he led the educational sub-committee of the Benson Commission. In 1986, Ralf Dahrendorf became a Governor of the London School of Economics. From 1987 to 1997, he was Warden of St Antony's College at the University of Oxford, succeeding the historian Sir Raymond Carr. In 1982, Dahrendorf was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1988, he acquired British citizenship. and became known as Sir Ralf Dahrendorf (as only KBEs who are British subjects are entitled to use that title). On 15 July 1993, he was created a life peer with the title Baron Dahrendorf of Clare Market in the City of Westminster. Clare Market is near the London School of Economics, and is also used for car parking by LSE staff. Dahrendorf chose this name to honor the School in this way, and also as a sign of his liberal humor. He sat in the House of Lords as a cross-bencher. Between 2000 and 2006, Dahrendorf served as Chairman of the Judging Panel of the FIRST Award for Responsible Capitalism. He received the FIRST Responsible Capitalism lifetime Achievement Award in 2009. Dahrendorf insisted that even the most basic civil rights, including equality and freedom of expression, be given constitutional legitimacy. On 11 July 2007, he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Studies. In January 2005, he was appointed a Research Professor at the Social Science Research Center in Berlin (WZB).WZB website Dahrendorf held dual citizenship in the UK and Germany. After retiring, he lived partially in Germany and partially in the United Kingdom, with one home in London and one in Bonndorf in south-western Germany. When asked which city he considered his home, he once said, \\"I am a Londoner\\". He also once said that his life was marked by a conflict between the obligation he felt to the country of his birth, Germany and the attraction he felt for Britain. Death Dahrendorf died in Cologne, Germany, aged 80, on 17 June 2009, after suffering from cancer. He was survived by his third wife, three daughters, and one grandchild. Dahrendorf's concepts=Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society In 1959, Dahrendorf published in his most influential work on social inequality, Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society. Despite later revisions and affirmations of his work, this book still remains as his first detailed and most influential account of the problem of social inequality in modern, or post-capitalist societies.Grabb, Edward G. \\"Theories of Social Inequality.\\" Ontario: Harcourt Brace & Company. 1997 In analyzing and evaluating the arguments of structural functionalism and Marxism, Dahrendorf believed that neither theory alone could account for all of society. Marxism did not account for evidence of obvious social integration and cohesion. Structural functionalism, on the other hand, did not focus enough on social conflict.Dahrendorf, Ralf.\\"Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society.\\" Stanford CA: Stanford University. 1959 He also asserted that Karl Marx defined class in a narrow and historically-specific context. During Marx's time, wealth was the determining factor in attaining power. The wealthy and therefore the powerful ruled, leaving no way for the poor to gain any power or increase their position in society. Drawing on aspects of both Marxism and structural functionalists to form his own beliefs, Dahrendorf highlighted the changes that have occurred in modern society. Dahrendorf believed in two approaches to society, Utopian and Rationalist. Utopian is the balance of values and solidity and Rationalist is the dissension and disagreement. While he believes that both are social perspectives, the Utopian approach is most apparent in modern-day society, leaving Dahrendorf to create a balance between the two views. Dahrendorf discusses literary utopias to show that the structural-functionalists idea of the social system is utopians in itself because it possess all the necessary characteristics. Specifically, with democracy came voting for political parties, and increased social mobility. He believes that the struggle for authority creates conflict. Money, political power, and social status were all controlled by the same group ‚Äì the capitalist ‚Äì which gave the workers little incentive to accept the status quo. Furthermore, he believes that traditional Marxism ignores consensus and integration in modern social structures. Dahrendorf's theory defined class not in terms of wealth like Marx, but by levels of authority. Dahrendorf combines elements from both of these perspectives to develop his own theory about class conflict in post-capitalist society. Dahrendorf agrees with Marx that authority, in the 19th century, was based on income, and thus the rich bourgeoisie ruled the state. Yet things have changed then, where workers formed trade unions and allowed them to negotiate with the capitalist. Class conflict theory Dahrendorf developed, cultivated, and advanced his theory of class conflict. He proposes a symbolic model of class conflict with authority as the generic form of domination, combined with a strong systematic view of society and the structuration of class relationships. This new theory is said to have taken place in reaction to structural functionalism and in many ways represents its antithesis. The conflict theory attempts to bring together structural functionalism and Marxism. According to Dahrendorf, functionalism is beneficial while trying to understand consensus while the conflict theory is used to understand conflict and coercion. In order to understand structural functionalism, we study three bodies of work: Davis and Moore, Parsons, and Merton. Dahrendorf states that capitalism has undergone major changes since Marx initially developed his theory on class conflict. This new system of capitalism, known as post-capitalism, is characterized by diverse class structure and a fluid system of power relations. Thus, it involves a much more complex system of inequality than Marx originally outlined. Dahrendorf contends that post-capitalist society has institutionalized class conflict into state and economic spheres. For example, class conflict has been habituated through unions, collective bargaining, the court system, and legislative debate. In effect, the severe class strife typical of Marx's time is not longer relevant. Conflict theorists like Dahrendorf often took the exact opposite view of functionalists. Whereas functionalists believe that society was oscillating very slightly, if not completely static, conflict theorists said that \\"every society at every point is subject to process of change\\". Conflict theorists believe that there is \\"dissension and conflict at every point in the social system\\" and \\"many societal elements as contributing to disintegration and change\\". They believe order comes from coercion from those at the top, and that power is an important factor in social order. In developing his conflict theory, Dahrendorf recognized consensus theory was also necessary to fully reflect society. Consensus theory focuses on the value integration into society, while conflict theory focuses on conflicts of interest and the force that holds society together despite these stresses. In the past, structural functionalism was the commanding theory in sociology, until the conflict theory came along as its major challenger. However, both structural functionalism and the conflict theory have received major criticisms. In fact, Dahrendorf asserted that there has to be consensus to have conflict, as he said that the two were prerequisites for each other. The opposite is also true, he believed ‚Äì‚Äì conflict can result in cohesion and consensus. However, Dahrendorf did not believe the two theories could be combined into one cohesive and comprehensive theory. Instead, Dahrendorf's thesis was \\"the differential distribution of authority invariably becomes the determining factor of systematic social conflicts\\". \\"In the end, conflict theory should be seen as a litte more than a transitional development in the history of sociological theory. Although the theory failed because it didn't go far in the direction of Marxian theory, it was still early in the 1950s and 1960s for American sociology to accept a full-fledged Marxian approach. However, conflict theory was helping in setting the stage for the beginning of the acceptance by the late 1960s\\". Authority Dahrendorf opposed those who were on an individual level. Dahrendorf believed that Marx's theory could be updated to reflect modern society and Roman society. He rejects Marx's two-class system as too simplistic and overly focused on property ownership. Due to the rise of the joint stock company, ownership does not necessarily reflect control of economic production in modern society. Instead of describing the fundamental differences of class in terms of property, Dahrendorf claims that we must \\"replace the possession, or non-possession, of effective private property by the exercise of, or exclusion from, authority as the criterion of class formation\\". A crucial component to Dahrendorf's conflict theory is the idea of authority. Although it initially appears to be an individual issue and psychological, Dahrendorf argues that authority is related to positions and not to individuals. In this way, subordination and authority are products of expectation specified by society, and if those roles are not adhered to, sanctions are imposed. Dahrendorf expands on this idea with the notion that roles of authority may conflict when in different positions that call for different things. According to Dahrendorf, these different defined areas of society where people's roles may be different are called imperatively coordinated associations. The groups of society in different associations are drawn together by their common interests. Dahrendorf explains that latent interests are natural interests that arise unconsciously in conflict between superordinates and subordinates. He defines manifest interests as latent interests when they are realized. In conclusion, Dahrendorf believes that understanding authority to be the key to understanding social conflict. Dahrendorf, like Merton, looked at latent and manifest interests and further classified them as unconscious and conscious interests. He found the connection between these two concepts to be problematic for the conflict theory. Dahrendorf believed that the basis of class conflict was the division of three groups of society: quasi groups, interest groups, and conflict groups. Thus, society can be split up into the \\"command class\\" and the \\"obey class\\". The command class exercises authority, while the obey class not only has no authority, and but is also subservient to that of others. With a clear interplay between both class types class conflict theory sought to explain that interplay. Quasi groups are \\"aggregates of incumbents of positions with identical role interests\\". Interest groups are derived from the quasi groups and they are organized with members, an organization, and a program or goal. The main difference between quasi groups and interest groups are that interest groups are able to organize and have a sense of \\"belonging\\" or identity. Darhendorf acknowledged that other conditions like politics, adequate personnel, and recruitment would play a role along with the groups. He also believed that, under ideal circumstances, conflict could be explained without reference to other variables. Unlike Marx, however, he did not believe that random recruitment into the quasi group, it would not start a conflict group. In contrast to Lewis Coser's ideas that functions of conflict maintained the status quo, Dahrendorf believed that that conflict also leads to change (in social structure) and development. His belief in a changing society separated Dahrendorf's ideas from Marx who supported the concept of a utopia. Marx and Dahrendorf's perspectives on class formation Marx believed history to be defined as class struggle. Marx defined class as the difference between the dominating class and those who dominate. He believed that in modern society there were three types of classes: Capitalists, workers and petite bourgeoisie. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie are the pillars in the formation of classes. Marx believed that the battle between the different classes formed the concept of class phenomenon. Marx understood that there are two classes: the rulers who control the means of production, and the ruled who worked with the means of production. Every society needs both. The conflicts between them causes a destruction of the existing societal order so that it can be replaced by a new one. On the other hand, Dahrendorf believed that the formation of classes was the organization of common interests. This further means that people who are in positions of authority are supposed to control subordination, meaning that sanctions could be put into effect against people who fail to obey authority commands, resulting in fines and further punishments. Dahrendorf argues that society is composed of multiple units that are called imperatively coordinated associations. He saw social conflict as the difference between dominating and subject groups in imperatively coordinated associations.[32] Marx believed that class formation was based on the ownership of private property. On the contrary, Dahrendorf argued that class formation was always based on authority. He defined authority as a facet of social organizations and as a common element of social structures. There is also another difference between Marx and Dahrendorf concerning the structure of societies. Dahrendorf believed that society had two aspects: consensus and conflict, static and change, order and dissension, cohesion and the role of power, integration and conflict, and lastly consensus and constraint. He saw them all as equally the double aspects of society. On this point, Dahrendorf asserted that society could not survive without both consensus and conflict. He felt this way because without conflict, there can be no consensus, and although consensus leads to conflict, conflict also leads to consensus. Criticism The theory takes only a macrosociological perspective. The theory fails to address much of social life. In increasingly modern, multicultural societies, the contested concept and construct of identity received growing emphasis, and was the focus of many debates. As a consequence of the debates over identity, and inevitably in a globalising, modern, multicultural world, the issues of citizenship came into play. Specifically, the discussions analysed the ways in which citizenship contributed to the formation and construction of identities. Dahrendorf's adherence to a Marxian position seemingly prevented him from participating in these debates. Absent from Dahrendorf's theory were any significant discussions of culture, and therefore, citizenship and identity. Relationship to other classical theorists and perspectives Unlike many of the other works published by social theorists in the 1950s, Dahrendorf's work acknowledges the same class interests that worried Marx. Like Marx, Dahrendorf agreed that conflict is still a basic fact of social life. Dahrendorf believed that class conflict could have beneficial consequences for society, such as progressive change. Dahrendorf is recognised for being one of the best departures from the structural functionalist tradition of the 1950s. Dahrendorf criticised and wanted to challenge the \\"false, utopian representation of societal harmony, stability, and consensus by the structural functionalist school.\\"Grabb, Edward G. \\"Theories of Social Inequality.\\" Toronto: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston of Canada. 1984 Nevertheless, Dahrendorf still shares key ideas with structural functionalists, such as a general faith in the efficacy of political and economic institutions. Like Weber, Dahrendorf criticises Marx's view that the working class will ultimately become a homogeneous group of unskilled machine operators. Dahrendorf points out that in postcapitalist society there are elaborate distinctions regarding income, prestige, skill level, and life chances. Dahrendorf's pluralist view of class and power structures and belief that hierarchies of authority are inevitable in modern societies also reflect Weberian ideas.

Known as the \\"Picasso of the North\\", Morrisseau created works depicting the legends of his people, the cultural and political tensions between native Canadian and European traditions, his existential struggles, and his deep spirituality and mysticism. His style is characterized by thick black outlines and bright colors. He founded the Woodlands School of Canadian art and was a prominent member of the ‚ÄúIndian Group of Seven‚Äù.  Biography  An Anishinaabe, Morrisseau was born March 14, 1932 on the Sand Point Ojibwe reserve near Beardmore, Ontario. His full name is Jean-Baptiste Norman Henry Morrisseau, but he signs his work using the Cree syllabics writing ·êÖ·ìµ·êö·ê±·ê¶·ëØ·ê±·ìÄ·ê¶·ìØ (Ozaawaabiko-binesi, unpointed: ·êÖ·ì¥·êò·ê±·ëØ·ê±·ìÄ·ìØ, \\"Copper/Brass [Thunder]Bird\\"), as his pen-name for his Anishnaabe name ·í•·ê¢·íÅ·ê±·ê¶·ê† ·êä·ìÇ·í•·ê¶·ëÆ (Miskwaabik Animikii, unpointed: ·í•·ê¢·ëø·ê±·ê† ·êä·ìÇ·í•·ë≠, \\"Copper Thunderbird\\"). In accordance with Anishnaabe tradition, he was raised by his maternal grandparents. His grandfather, Moses Potan Nanakonagos, a shaman, taught him the traditions and legends of his people. His grandmother, Grace Theresa Potan Nanakonagos, was a devout Catholic and from her he learned the tenets of Christianity. The contrast between these two religious traditions became an important factor in his intellectual and artistic development. At the age of six, Morrisseau was sent to a Catholic residential school, where students were educated in the European tradition, native culture was repressed, and the use of native language was forbidden. After two years he returned home and started attending a local community school. At the age of 19, he became very sick. He was taken to a doctor but his health kept deteriorating. Fearing for his life, his mother called a medicine-woman who performed a renaming ceremony: She gave him the new name Copper Thunderbird. According to Anishnaabe tradition, giving a powerful name to a dying person can give them new energy and save their lives. Morrisseau recovered after the ceremony and from then on always signed his works with his new name. Morrisseau contracted tuberculosis in 1956 and was sent to Fort William Sanatorium to recover. There he met his future wife Harriet Kakegamic with whom he had seven children, Victoria, Michael, Peter, David, Lisa, Eugene, and Christian. After being invited by Ontario Provincial Police Constable, Robert Sheppard, to meet the artist, the anthropologist Selwyn Dewdney became an early advocate of Morrisseau's and was very interested in Morrisseau's deep knowledge of native culture and myth. Dewdney was the first to take his art to a wider public. Jack Pollock, a Toronto art dealer, helped expose Morrisseau's art to a wider audience in the 1960s. The two initially met in 1962 while Pollock was teaching a painting workshop in Beardmore.Dear M - Letters From a Gentleman of Excess by Jack Pollock (1989) As Pollock did not drive, Susan Ross whom Morrisseau had met in 1961 Susan Ross \\"Painting is a Way of Life\\"- A Retrospective Exhibition, Thunder Bay Art Gallery June 3 ‚Äì July 17, 1994 page 15 and Sheila Burnford drove Pollock to visit Morrisseau at his home to view more of his works. Immediately struck by the genius of Morrisseau's art, he immediately organized an exhibition of his work at his Toronto gallery. One of Morrisseau's early commissions was for a large mural in the Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo 67, a revolutionary exhibit voicing the dissatisfaction of the First Nations People of Canada with their social and political situation. In 1972, Morrisseau was caught in a hotel fire in Vancouver and suffered serious burns. On that occasion, he had a vision of Jesus encouraging him to be a role model through his art. He converted to the apostolic faith and started introducing Christian themes in his art. A year later he was arrested for drunk and disorderly behaviour and was incarcerated for his own protection. He was assigned an extra cell as a studio and was allowed to attend a nearby church. Morrisseau was the founder of a Canadian-originated school of art called Woodland or sometimes Legend or Medicine painting. His work is influential on a group of younger Ojibwe and Cree artists, such as Blake Debassige, Benjamin Chee Chee, and Leland Bell. His influence on the Woodland school of artists was recognized in 1984 by the Art Gallery of Ontario exhibit Norval Morrisseau and the Emergence of the Image Makers. He spent his youth in remote isolation in northern Ontario, near Thunder Bay, where his artistic style developed without the usual influences of other artist's imagery. As the sole originator of his \\"Woodland\\" style he has become an inspiration to three generations of artists. In 1978, Morrisseau was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. As Morrisseau's health began to decline as a result of Parkinson's disease and a stroke in 1994, he was cared for by his adopted family Gabe and Michelle Vadas. In 2005 and 2006, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa organized a retrospective of his work. This was the first time that the Gallery dedicated a solo exposition to a native artist. In the final months of his life, the artist used a wheelchair and lived in a residence in Nanaimo, British Columbia. He was unable to paint due to his poor health. He died of cardiac arrest‚Äîcomplications arising from Parkinson's disease on December 4, 2007 in Toronto General Hospital. He was buried after a private ceremony in Northern Ontario next to the grave of his former wife, Harriet, on Anishinaabe land. The National Arts Centre, urban ink co- production, Copper Thunderbird, premiered on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) on Monday, February 4, 2008. Norval Morrisseau was honoured with a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award during the NAAF Awards show in 2008.  Style  Morrisseau was a self-taught artist. He developed his own techniques and artistic vocabulary that captured ancient legends and images that came to him in visions or dreams. He was originally criticized by the native community because his images disclosed traditional spiritual knowledge. Initially he painted on any material that he could find, especially birchbark, and also moose hide. Dewdney encouraged him to use earth-tone colors and traditional material, which he thought were appropriate to Morrisseau's native style. The subjects of his art in the early period were myths and traditions of the Anishnaabe people. He is acknowledged to have initiated the Woodland School of native art, where images similar to the petroglyphs of the Great Lakes region were now captured in paintings and prints. His later style changed: he used more standard material and the colors became progressively brighter, eventually obtaining a neon-like brilliance. The themes also moved from traditional myth to depicting his own personal struggles. He also produced art depicting Christian subjects: during his incarceration, he attended a local church where he was struck by the beauty of the images on stained-glass windows. Some of his paintings, like Indian Jesus Christ, imitate that style and represent characters from the Bible with native features. After he joined the new age religion Eckankar in 1976, he started representing on canvas its mystical beliefs. The cover art for the Bruce Cockburn album Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws is a painting by Norval Morrisseau.  Fakes and forgeries  On the left, 2004 email from Norval Morrisseau requesting the removal of nine items identified as fakes from sale, directed at an unknown dealer. On the right, a 2007 press release from Norval Morrisseau disavowing any link with the \\"Morrisseau Family Foundation\\", and identifying the Norval Morrisseau Heritage Society as the sole authority to create a catalogue raisonn√© of his work. The prevalence of fakes and forgeries was of deep concern to Morrisseau, particularly during his later years, and he actively sought to remove these from the marketplace. In 2005, Morrisseau established the Norval Morrisseau Heritage Society (NMHS). The Society is currently compiling a database of Norval Morrisseau paintings to discredit many prevalent Morrisseau forgeries. This committee, not affiliated with any commercial gallery or art dealer, comprises highly respected members of the academic, legal and Aboriginal communities working on a volunteer basis. It is charged with creating a complete catalogue raisonn√© of Norval Morrisseau artwork. The NMHS is currently researching Morrisseau art, provenance and materials and techniques in order to complete the task assigned to them by the artist. The NMHS continue their work and in 2008, were in Red Lake, Ontario to research additional information and art by the artist. Letter from the solicitor of the Norval Morrisseau Heritage Society confirming the existence and purpose of the Society established by Norval Morrisseau. The Art Dealers Association of Canada (ADAC) issued the following directive in the Winter 2007 newsletter to their membership: \\"The Art Dealers Association of Canada is enacting a rule and regulation that no certificates of authenticity will be issued by any members of ADAC with respect to any works or purported works by Norval Morrisseau and that the Norval Morrisseau Heritage Society is the sole authority for the authentication of works by Norval Morrisseau.\\" ADAC also revoked the membership of a dealer who failed to comply with this directive. Morrisseau also engaged in more direct intervention, identifying fake and forged works available for sale, particularly those purported to be painted by him in the so-called \\"70s style\\". He wrote to galleries and made sworn declarations identifying items being sold as \\"fakes and imitations\\". More than ten sworn declarations were directed to at least seven dealers and galleries during 1993-2007, requesting that fake and forged works be removed or destroyed. The debate concerning the authenticity of the \\"70s paintings\\" commonly found in the marketplace, continues with ongoing litigation. A 2019 documentary called There Are No Fakes, directed by Jamie Kastner, investigated an alleged forgery ring that attempted to pass off fake Morrisseau paintings as originals for several years. In 2019, an Ontario appeals court ordered a Toronto gallery to pay $50,000 for breach of contract and $10,000 in punitive damages to Barenaked Ladies keyboardist Kevin Hearn, who bought a Morrisseau painting that the gallery could not authenticate with a provenance statement. A lower court had ruled against Hearn.

Background Born in Upton, Nottinghamshire, England, Fiona was into sports as a child, especially gymnastics, horse-racing and ice-skating. She attended Lowes Wong Junior School in nearby Southwell before going to The Rodney School in Kirklington. Later, Fiona worked as an administrator for the RAF where she able to gain experience in flying and gliding. She also opened her own gymnasium, but tragedy struck when her husband, Bill, was killed in a road accident. In 1992, Fiona met her present husband, Mike, who introduced her to outdoor sports such as mountaineering. Mike also had ambitions to cross the South Pole overland, and these plans encouraged Fiona to follow suit. Expeditions In 2000, Michael and Fiona became the first married couple to reach the South Pole, along with Catherine Hartley. In 2001, Mike and Fiona set up an expedition to reach the North Pole, raising money for charity in the process. Guiding them was Canadian mountaineer and arctic adventurer Paul Landry. They reached their destination in 56 days. Fiona's greatest feat came in 2004 though, when she reached the South Pole on 10 January, beating her rival Rosie Stancer in the process. The previous record was 44 days, and the previous best for a woman was 50 days - by the Norwegian Liv Arneson. Walking 22 miles a day, Fiona had to pull a sledge weighing 285 pounds, and her success is perhaps even more remarkable considering she lost her satellite navigation system 10 days in.

He is also known by the name Adam Riese.  Life  Almost nothing is known about Ries' childhood, youth and education. It is not even possible to determine the year of his birth with certainty. The caption on the only known contemporary portrait of the mathematician reads: ANNO 1550 ADAM RIES SEINS ALTERS IM LVIII. So he was in his 58th year of age at the time of the picture, which was made in 1550. From this it can be deduced that he was born in 1492, although if he did not turn 58 until the end of 1550, he could alternatively have been born in 1493. The location of his birth, Staffelstein, can be determined with certainty, since he gives information about himself in the preface to his book, Co√ü. His father was the owner of the mill there, Contz Ries, and his mother, Eva Kittler, was his father's second wife. The first decades after Ries' birth are not documented, so it is not known which schools he attended. There is also no information about the studies of the later mathematician in the matriculation registers of the universities which existed at that time. The first time that Adam Ries was mentioned in a document was on 22 April 1517, when he appeared before the Council of Staffelstein because of a dispute over an inheritance. By 1509, he was already living with his younger brother, Conrad, in Zwickau, who attended the Latin school there. In 1518, Ries went to Erfurt, where he ran a mathematics school, and he wrote two of his mathematics books and had them published there. In 1522 or 1523, he moved to the newly founded mining town of Annaberg where he spent the rest of his life. There he finished work on the manuscript of his algebra textbook, Co√ü, in 1524, although the book was not published until 1992 by B.G. Teubner. During this time, Ries became acquainted with Anna Leuber, the daughter of Freiberg master fitter, Andreas Leuber. The wedding of the couple was mentioned in the register of the St. Anne's Church in Annaberg in 1525. In the same year, he took the oath of citizenship, purchased a house in Johannisgasse in Annaberg and settled down. He first earned his living as a Rezessschreiber (a person who checked the calculations of the mines), and later as a Gegenschreiber (a bookkeeper of the mines) and Zehntner (regional financial administrator). In 1539, he bought \\"Riesenburg\\", a small castle outside of the town, whose buildings still bear his name today. After his last work appeared in print in 1550, Ries died on 30 March 1559. Because of scanty information, it is not known where he is buried, whether in Annaberg, the Riesenburg or elsewhere.  Family  Rechnung auff der linihen Rechnung auff der linihen und federn Arithmetic book, 1574 Adam Ries monument at the St. Trinitatiskirche in Annaberg-Buchholz Bust in Erfurt Ries and his wife had at least eight children. Three of the five sons, Adam, Abraham, and Jacob, were all active as mathematicians in Annaberg at times. While Abraham and Jacob died in their home town in 1604, Adam is supposed to have settled in the Harz mountains. The fourth son, Isaac, moved to Leipzig, where he was active as a Visierer (a master of weights and measures). Paul, the fifth son, was a landowner and judge in Wiesa. The three daughters, Eva, Anna and Sybilla, all married in Annaberg. Adam Ries' descendants are the subject of constant, detailed genealogical research. Great numbers of his descendants still live in the upper Ore Mountains today. The Adam-Ries-Bund (Adam Ries Association, see external links) has taken on the task of researching all of the descendants of Adam Ries and, to date, has more than 20,000 direct descendants in its continually updated database.  Works  * Rechnung auff der linihen (1518): In it, Ries describes calculating on the lines of a calculating board, a kind of abacus. According to the foreword, the second edition was expressly intended for children. * Rechnung auff der linihen und federn... (1522): Besides calculating on the calculating board, he describes numerical calculations with Indian/Arabic digits. The intended readers were the apprentices of businessmen and craftsmen. Until now, it has been published 114 times. * Co√ü (manuscript 1524, printed in 1992): The algebra textbook is named after the common name for the unknown variable in the German Middle Ages, and it establishes the connection between medieval and modern algebra. * Ein Gerechent B√ºchlein/ auff den Sch√∂ffel/ Eimer/ vnd Pfundtgewicht... (manuscript 1533, printed in 1536): A book with tables for calculating everyday prices; a kind of guide which, according to Ries' foreword, helps \\"that the poor common man not be cheated when buying bread.\\" Also known by the name of \\"Annaberger Brotordnung.\\" * Rechenung nach der lenge/ auff den Linihen vnd Feder. (1550): Often cited under the shortened title, \\"Practica\\". The book also shows a portrait of the author for the first time, which is the only contemporary picture of Ries at all, and also gives an indication of the year of his birth. Ries did not write his works in Latin, as was usual at that time, but in German..  Name  Since the spelling of names was not as fixed at that time as it is today, the contemporary spellings \\"Ris, \\"Rise\\", \\"Ryse\\" and even \\"Reye√ü\\" are also sometimes found. In today's usage, both variants of his name, \\"Ries\\" and \\"Riese\\", can be found. The latter is usual in the German expression \\"nach Adam Riese\\" which means \\"according to Adam Ries\\" and it is used when speaking about simple arithmetic, e.g. zwei und zwei macht, nach Adam Riese, vier (two plus two is, according to Adam Ries, four). Furthermore, the German word \\"Riese\\" can be translated as \\"giant\\" in English, thus inspiring a common tongue-in-cheek adaptation of the beforementioned saying, \\"nach Adam Riese und Eva Zwerg\\" (\\"according to Adam Giant and Eve Dwarf).  Honours & Monuments  The Nysa family main-belt asteroid 7655 Adamries was named after him in 1997.  Annaberg  * 1893: Bust by Robert Henze On the occasion of the 400th birthday of Adam Ries, the Annaberg Historical Society decided in 1891 to put up a monument to the mathematician. The sculpture by the Dresden sculptor, Henze, was not dedicated until 5 November 1893 because of financial difficulties. In 1943, the bronze bust was melted to make armaments and it was replaced ten years later by a sandstone copy. At the end of the 1970s, this was completely removed from the town because of fears that its condition would continue to deteriorate due to the material. In 1991, a new sandstone bust was exhibited in its current position. After severe damage by vandalism in 1992, it was once again reconstructed through the initiative of the Adam Ries Association, and it was once again placed before the church on the 100th anniversary of the first dedication.

This may be done without focusing on concrete applications of the concepts in the physical world Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independently of any application outside mathematics. These concepts may originate in real-world concerns, and the results obtained may later turn out to be useful for practical applications, but pure mathematicians are not primarily motivated by such applications. Instead, the appeal is attributed to the intellectual challenge and aesthetic beauty of working out the logical consequences of basic principles. While pure mathematics has existed as an activity since at least Ancient Greece, the concept was elaborated upon around the year 1900, after the introduction of theories with counter-intuitive properties (such as non-Euclidean geometries and Cantor's theory of infinite sets), and the discovery of apparent paradoxes (such as continuous functions that are nowhere differentiable, and Russell's paradox). This introduced the need to renew the concept of mathematical rigor and rewrite all mathematics accordingly, with a systematic use of axiomatic methods. This led many mathematicians to focus on mathematics for its own sake, that is, pure mathematics. Nevertheless, almost all mathematical theories remained motivated by problems coming from the real world or from less abstract mathematical theories. Also, many mathematical theories, which had seemed to be totally pure mathematics, were eventually used in applied areas, mainly physics and computer science. A famous early example is Isaac Newton's demonstration that his law of universal gravitation implied that planets move in orbits that are conic sections, geometrical curves that had been studied in antiquity by Apollonius. Another example is the problem of factoring large integers, which is the basis of the RSA cryptosystem, widely used to secure internet communications. It follows that, presently, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a philosophical point of view or a mathematician's preference than a rigid subdivision of mathematics. In particular, it is not uncommon that some members of a department of applied mathematics describe themselves as pure mathematicians. History=Ancient Greece Ancient Greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics. Plato helped to create the gap between \\"arithmetic\\", now called number theory, and \\"logistic\\", now called arithmetic. Plato regarded logistic (arithmetic) as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who \\"must learn the art of numbers or [they] will not know how to array [their] troops\\" and arithmetic (number theory) as appropriate for philosophers \\"because [they have] to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being.\\" Euclid of Alexandria, when asked by one of his students of what use was the study of geometry, asked his slave to give the student threepence, \\"since he must make gain of what he learns.\\" The Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga was asked about the usefulness of some of his theorems in Book IV of Conics to which he proudly asserted, > They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, > in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and > for no other reason. And since many of his results were not applicable to the science or engineering of his day, Apollonius further argued in the preface of the fifth book of Conics that the subject is one of those that \\"...seem worthy of study for their own sake.\\" 19th century The term itself is enshrined in the full title of the Sadleirian Chair, Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics, founded (as a professorship) in the mid-nineteenth century. The idea of a separate discipline of pure mathematics may have emerged at that time. The generation of Gauss made no sweeping distinction of the kind, between pure and applied. In the following years, specialisation and professionalisation (particularly in the Weierstrass approach to mathematical analysis) started to make a rift more apparent. 20th century At the start of the twentieth century mathematicians took up the axiomatic method, strongly influenced by David Hilbert's example. The logical formulation of pure mathematics suggested by Bertrand Russell in terms of a quantifier structure of propositions seemed more and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject to the simple criteria of rigorous proof. Pure mathematics, according to a view that can be ascribed to the Bourbaki group, is what is proved. Pure mathematician became a recognized vocation, achievable through training. The case was made that pure mathematics is useful in engineering education:A. S. Hathaway (1901) \\"Pure mathematics for engineering students\\", Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 7(6):266‚Äì71. :There is a training in habits of thought, points of view, and intellectual comprehension of ordinary engineering problems, which only the study of higher mathematics can give. Generality and abstraction An illustration of the Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox, a famous result in pure mathematics. Although it is proven that it is possible to convert one sphere into two using nothing but cuts and rotations, the transformation involves objects that cannot exist in the physical world. One central concept in pure mathematics is the idea of generality; pure mathematics often exhibits a trend towards increased generality. Uses and advantages of generality include the following: * Generalizing theorems or mathematical structures can lead to deeper understanding of the original theorems or structures * Generality can simplify the presentation of material, resulting in shorter proofs or arguments that are easier to follow. * One can use generality to avoid duplication of effort, proving a general result instead of having to prove separate cases independently, or using results from other areas of mathematics. * Generality can facilitate connections between different branches of mathematics. Category theory is one area of mathematics dedicated to exploring this commonality of structure as it plays out in some areas of math. Generality's impact on intuition is both dependent on the subject and a matter of personal preference or learning style. Often generality is seen as a hindrance to intuition, although it can certainly function as an aid to it, especially when it provides analogies to material for which one already has good intuition. As a prime example of generality, the Erlangen program involved an expansion of geometry to accommodate non- Euclidean geometries as well as the field of topology, and other forms of geometry, by viewing geometry as the study of a space together with a group of transformations. The study of numbers, called algebra at the beginning undergraduate level, extends to abstract algebra at a more advanced level; and the study of functions, called calculus at the college freshman level becomes mathematical analysis and functional analysis at a more advanced level. Each of these branches of more abstract mathematics have many sub-specialties, and there are in fact many connections between pure mathematics and applied mathematics disciplines. A steep rise in abstraction was seen mid 20th century. In practice, however, these developments led to a sharp divergence from physics, particularly from 1950 to 1983. Later this was criticised, for example by Vladimir Arnold, as too much Hilbert, not enough Poincar√©. The point does not yet seem to be settled, in that string theory pulls one way, while discrete mathematics pulls back towards proof as central. Pure vs. applied mathematics Mathematicians have always had differing opinions regarding the distinction between pure and applied mathematics. One of the most famous (but perhaps misunderstood) modern examples of this debate can be found in G.H. Hardy's A Mathematician's Apology. It is widely believed that Hardy considered applied mathematics to be ugly and dull. Although it is true that Hardy preferred pure mathematics, which he often compared to painting and poetry, Hardy saw the distinction between pure and applied mathematics to be simply that applied mathematics sought to express physical truth in a mathematical framework, whereas pure mathematics expressed truths that were independent of the physical world. Hardy made a separate distinction in mathematics between what he called \\"real\\" mathematics, \\"which has permanent aesthetic value\\", and \\"the dull and elementary parts of mathematics\\" that have practical use. Hardy considered some physicists, such as Einstein and Dirac, to be among the \\"real\\" mathematicians, but at the time that he was writing the Apology he considered general relativity and quantum mechanics to be \\"useless\\", which allowed him to hold the opinion that only \\"dull\\" mathematics was useful. Moreover, Hardy briefly admitted that‚Äîjust as the application of matrix theory and group theory to physics had come unexpectedly‚Äîthe time may come where some kinds of beautiful, \\"real\\" mathematics may be useful as well. Another insightful view is offered by Magid: See also *Applied mathematics *Logic *Metalogic *Metamathematics ReferencesExternal links *What is Pure Mathematics? ‚Äì Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Waterloo * What is Pure Mathematics? by Professor P.

A common theme, and the reason for the term misconduct, is that these violations occur during work or in a situation of a power imbalance. It frames offenses which are non-criminal but nevertheless violating of another person's personal boundary in the area of sexuality and intimate personal relationships. Sexual misconduct is often perpetrated against an individual without his or her consent or where the power dynamics of the relationship are being challenged in an effort to redefine the nature or form of consent necessary in a given circumstance. The alleged misconduct can be of various degrees, such as exposure of genitals, assault, aggressive come-ons, pleading, or even inattentiveness to nonverbal cues of discomfort.Dictionary of Ethical and Legal Terms and Issues, by Len Sperry, 2007 ‚Äì Routledge, pages 238-239. The \\"definition of sexual misconduct is far from clear\\" and it is a \\"lay term, sometimes used in institutional policies or by professional bodies\\", to deal with cases marked by power imbalance, coercion, and predatory behaviour.\\" Definitions In the legal sense, for a person in a position of authority it includes in particular any sexual activity between them and one of their subordinates. This commonly includes teachers and their students, clergy and their congregants, doctors and their patients, and employers and their employees. While such activity is usually not explicitly illegal, it is often against professional ethical codes. For example, a teacher may be fired and a doctor may have their medical license revoked because of sexual misconduct. In addition, the person in the subordinate position may allege sexual harassment. The University of Iowa defines sexual misconduct as \\"...unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that is committed without consent or by force, intimidation, coercion, or manipulation.\\" Entering a sexual relationship with a subordinate, even when the contact is initiated by the latter, is considered unethical by some because of the subordinate's vulnerability to the superior and the inequality of power that characterizes the relationship. In the case of the doctor- patient relationship, having a sexual relationship with the patient even after the professional relationship has concluded is considered problematic for the physician because of the potential for the patient's continuing dependence on and transference towards the physician. Therefore, sexual relationships with former patients are considered unethical by the medical profession when physicians \\"use or exploit the trust, knowledge, emotions or influence derived from the previous professional relationship\\" in any way. By contrast, legal ethics permit sexual relations with former client and, in California, with current clients as well so long as the sex is consensual and is not rendered in exchange for legal services. Some activities which are not strictly erotic, e.g. mooning (exposing the buttocks), streaking (running naked through a public area) and skinny dipping (swimming naked), are sometimes also categorized as sexual misconduct. Despite these opinions, others believe that sexual relations in workplace settings is not unethical including between boss and employee. Many companies do not prohibit so-called fraternization but instead recognize the difference between consensual dating and improper behavior. According to Joanne Laucius from the Ottawa Citizen, the \\"definition of sexual misconduct is far from clear\\" and the \\"word ‚Äòmisconduct‚Äô also lacks precision ‚Äî it can be used as a catch-all for all kinds of behaviour, often obscuring what actually happened\\". Laucius states that the terms \\"sexual violence or sexual harassment and assault are much more specific terms that convey the nature of the allegations.\\" Elaine Craig, an associate professor in the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University, states that \\"[s]exual misconduct is a lay term, sometimes used in institutional policies or by professional bodies. It covers an array of problematic sexual behaviour including sexual harassment, sexual assault and sexual abuse. Two of these terms have specific (and different) legal meanings: Sexual assault has a specific meaning in the criminal law context, unlike sexual misconduct, which may cover both criminal and non-criminal conduct.\\" Elizabeth Sheehy, the Shirley Greenberg Chair for Women and the Legal Profession at the University of Ottawa, states that \\"[s]exual misconduct is a social issue and not a fixed line‚Äîit shifts as women gain access to economic and political equality. It's not found under criminal law, in human rights codes, or collective agreements. It might be found under professional disciplinary codes.\\" She states that \\"we don't have a consensus on it, either\\", \\"...except that there are three key considerations. First, a power imbalance. Second, coercion, whether implicit or explicit. Third, predatory behaviour.\\" Ally Crockford, a public educator at the Ottawa Rape Crisis Centre, states that \\"[s]exual misconduct is... a catch- all for behaviour that is not OK, but it's unclear how it should be classified. It could be any number of things‚Äîsomeone is made to feel uncomfortable, or they feel they are being watched or looked at in a certain way.\\" Michelle Cottle wrote in The Atlantic that the \\"...almost infinite shades of creepy misbehavior on display are challenging the legal and cultural categories used to describe them\\", as this issue is, in \\"...some ways, uncharted territory\\", making it \\"...hard to tell how the new lines will be drawn, much less where.\\" Cottle states that \\"[m]illennials and younger Gen Xers seem to have a broader definition of what constitutes harassment as well as less hesitation about discussing their experiences\\". Among educators Suzuki Harunobu - \\"Sexual Misconduct\\", from the book Fashionable, Lusty Mane‚Äôemon, 1770 A literature review of educator sexual misconduct published by the US Department of Education found that 9.6% of high school students have experienced some form of sexual misconduct.the actual 9.6% figure was for 8th-11th grades. Author Charol Shakeshaft extrapolated it to K-12th, which is questionable. Black, Hispanic, and Native American Indian children are at greatest risk for sexual abuse. Also at increased risk are children with disabilities; the reason for this may be their greater need for individual attention and their possible problems with communicating. Children who have been victims of educator sexual misconduct usually have low self-esteem, and they are likely to develop suicidal ideation and depression. Because the abuser was a person the child was encouraged to trust, they may experience a sense of betrayal.

Denver Sluice In 1651 the first sluice was built across the river at Denver, by Cornelius Vermuyden, although it had to be rebuilt after bursting in 1713. The sluices play a major role in the drainage of the fens, being at the confluence of five watercourses. The area is now enjoyed by many tourists, and Denver Sluice is the home of West Norfolk Rowing Club and Denver Sailing Club. Denver is home to a fully restored 19th-century windmill, and lies on the path of the Roman Fen Causeway. Captain George Manby, the inventor, was born in the village in 1765, and a plaque commemorating this can be found at his birthplace. Its name came from Anglo-Saxon Dena f√¶r = \\"the ford or passage of the Danes\\", referring to Viking invasions. The fictional place Duke's Denver, the family seat of the Duke of Denver, brother of Lord Peter Wimsey in the novels of Dorothy L. Sayers, is also in Norfolk, but it is supposed to be situated several miles to the east of Denver village. The American city of Denver, Colorado is not directly named after this English village, but after the 19th-century American politician James W.

The province is divided into 11 districts and contains hundreds of villages. It has a population of about 512,100, which is multi-ethnic and mostly agriculturalists. Sheberghan is the capital of Jozjan province. History The province is named after the early medieval region and principality of Juzjan. Between the early 16th century and mid-18th century, the area was ruled by the Khanate of Bukhara. It was conquered by Ahmad Shah Durrani and became part of the Durrani Empire in or about 1750, which formed to the modern state of Afghanistan. The area was untouched by the British during the three Anglo-Afghan wars that were fought in the 19th and 20th centuries. Recent history Following a series of changing allegiances and falling out with Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik Pahlawan in 1997, the Taliban withdrew from the area, but in 1998 a contingent of 8,000 Taliban troops pressed through neighboring Faryab, seizing Abdul Rashid Dostum's headquarters in Sheberghan. NATO-trained Afghan Border Police in Sheberghan Swedish-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), which has been based in Mazar-e-Sharif since about 2005 and responsible for four provinces including Jozjan, established an office and some troops in the province. Security situation in the province has rapidly deteriorated in 2009 and 2010. A new Turkish PRT has also been established in the province in the summer of 2010, providing security to the area which also covers Sar-e Pol. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANFS) began expanding in the last decade and gradually took over security from International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border is maintained by the Afghan Border Police (ABP) while law and order for the rest of the province is provided by the NATO-trained Afghan National Police (ANP). Although it can be regarded as a relatively secured place compared to some other provinces of Afghanistan, there is an increasing number of incidents particularly in Darzab, Qush Tepa and Fayzabad districts. The Mazar-e-Sharif-Sheberghan highway (called Aqyol) has turned into a dangerous traveling route because of militants carrying out attacks against government forces, NGO workers and civilians. In April 2012 construction of a mega power network with power pylons carrying 500 megawatts of electricity from neighboring Turkmenistan started in the province; the project is supported by Turkmenistan and Turkey. Initial work on the $390 million project had already been completed. Turkmenistan will install power pylons over a distance of 374 kilometres on its soil toward the Afghanistan border and the project will take a year to complete.http://www.wadsam.com/power-network-in-jawzjan/ The network would supply electricity to many areas in Jozjan, Balkh, Sar-e Pol, Faryab and Kabul provinces. Politics and governance The Governor of the province is Murad Quenili, who replaced Mohammad Aleem Sayee in July 2013. Quenili was previously a senator representing his province Jozjan in the National Assembly of Afghanistan (Afghan Parliament). All law enforcement activities throughout the province are managed by the Afghan National Police (ANP). The police chief represents the Ministry of the Interior in Kabul. The ANP is backed by other Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), including the NATO-led forces. Healthcare The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 24% in 2005 to 44% in 2011.Archive, Civil Military Fusion Centre, The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 9% in 2005 to 21% in 2011.

He holds the rank of ensign, and is in the command division. Mayweather is one of the main characters throughout the show's entire four-season run. Character overview=Television series Mayweather was born in 2126 aboard the ECS Horizon, a human J-class cargo ship, and visited many places such as Trillius Prime, Draylax, Vega Colony, and both Tenebian moons. He is a \\"boomer\\", meaning he grew up in space aboard cargo ships, and that he has more experience in space than even his commanding officer, Captain Jonathan Archer. Mayweather is a quiet and enthusiastic young man who is a highly skilled pilot and has some spelunking experience. He has at least one brother, Paul, who became the captain of the Horizon after the death of their father, the ship's previous captain, in January 2153. Their mother, Rianna, was the ship's medic and chief engineer. There is also mention that Mayweather has a sister who is married, but she is never seen. Mayweather returned home to the Horizon circa January 10, 2153 while the Horizon was heading to the Deneva colony. While heading to Deneva Station, the Horizon was attacked by pirates but Mayweather's experience with weapons from Starfleet allowed the Horizon to defend herself against her attackers. Over the course of the series, Mayweather has been injured, incapacitated, or even \\"killed\\" more times than any other character in the primary cast. When Star Trek: Enterprise was first conceived, Mayweather was intended to be a lieutenant, because of his experience in space. His rank was changed to Ensign because the producers thought that having Mayweather and the older Malcolm Reed at a similar rank wouldn't be believable. Novels In the novel Rise of the Federation: A Choice of Futures, Mayweather is promoted to first officer of USS Pioneer under Captain Malcolm Reed. Mirror Universe In the two-part episode \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\", the Mirror Universe version of Travis Mayweather is a sergeant in the MACO corps.

It was the county town of the Isle of Ely which was a separate administrative county from 1889 to 1965. It is now the administrative centre of Fenland District Council. The town grew by becoming an important railway centre. Like many Fenland towns, March was once an island surrounded by marshes. It occupied the second largest \\"island\\" in the Great Level. As the land drained, the town grew and prospered as a trading and religious centre. It was also a minor port before, in more recent times, a market town and an administrative and railway centre. March is situated on the banks of the navigable old course of the River Nene, today mainly used by pleasure boats. History March was recorded as Merche in the Domesday Book of 1086, perhaps from the Old English mearc meaning 'boundary'. Modern March lies on the course of the Fen Causeway, a Roman road, and there is evidence of Roman settlements in the area. Before the draining of the fens, March was effectively an island in the marshy fens. The town probably owes its origin to the ford on the old course of the River Nene, where the road between Ely and Wisbech, the two chief towns of the Isle of Ely, crossed the river. At one time shipping on the River Nene provided the basis of the town's trade, but this declined with the coming of the railways in the 19th century. A single arch bridge was built over the River Nene towards the north end of the town in 1850. High Street, which is the chief thoroughfare, is continued over the bridge to Broad Street on the north side of the Nene, and The Causeway is lined with a fine avenue of elm and other trees. A Local Board of Health was formed in 1851, under Act 14 and 15 Vict. c. 10, but by the provisions of the Local Government Act 1894 the town became governed by an Urban District Council of 12 members. Gas lighting was provided by the March Gas and Coke Co. Limited. The Wisbech Water Works Company, under a provisional order obtained in 1884, supplied the town with water, which was brought through mains pipes from Wisbech, away. March was divided into four ecclesiastical parishes which, with three others, were formed out of the previous parish of Doddington after 1863, under the Doddington Rectory Division Acts of 1847 and 1856 [10 and 11 Vict. c. 3 (1847) and 19 and 20 Vict. c. 1 (1856)]. Kelly's Directory of Cambridgeshire 1900 HM Prison Whitemoor, opened in 1991, lies slightly to the northwest of the town. Whitemoor is a maximum security prison for nearly 500 men in Category A and B. Governance March has a town council. There are three wards, East, North and West; each ward returns four town councillors. A town mayor is elected by councillors at the annual meeting in May each year. The council administers allotments, sponsors band concerts and owns the March Museum. The town returns councillors to Fenland District Council and Cambridgeshire County Council. March is in the constituency of North East Cambridgeshire, currently represented by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit Secretary. The headquarters of Fenland District Council are at Fenland Hall, County Road, March. The former County Hall of Isle of Ely County Council, also on County Road, is now Hereward Hall, used by Cambridgeshire County Council. Markets March Town Hall and market. With a long history of trading, in the reign of Elizabeth I, March was a minor port. In 1566 eight boats, capable of carrying one, one and a half, or two cartloads, were used in the coal and grain trades. A certain amount of traffic in coal and other commodities, carried in barges, was observed by Dugdale in 1657. Local tradesmen's tokens of 1669, and a silver shilling token of 1811, have been noted. Originally a market appears to have been held near the original town (then village) centre, on land beside The Causeway. A Market Cross (now called The Stone Cross) points towards the existence of an early market and this cross was erected in the early 16th century. This site was very near St Wendreda's Church. In 1669, the town successfully petitioned King Charles II and in 1670 he granted the Lord of the Manor of Doddington a Royal Charter with the right to hold a market with two annual fairs, in spite of the opposition of Wisbech Corporation. This market was held on Fridays. The Lord of the Manor of Doddington, who owned a large part of March, gave special permission to the townspeople to sell their goods on some of his land in the town centre. This site, now called the Market Place, was then known as Bridge Green Common and later named Market Hill. In 1785, the tolls were assessed at ¬£6 per year. Soon after this the market appears to have lapsed, though the fairs continued to prosper. The development of the market was impeded by the lack of a covered hall and because market day in several neighbouring towns fell on the same day (Friday). In 1807, the Vestry decided that it was not hygienic for goods to be loaded or unloaded in the vicinity of the market and ordered all saw pits, timber and other encroachments around the Market Place to be removed. The market was struggling during this time and an attempt to revive it in 1821 was not very successful. A Butter Cross, also known as a market house, was erected in 1831. This building also housed the town fire engine and had an upstairs room that for a time housed the Clock House School and later the Town Surveyor's Office. This office was covered by a turret which housed the Town Clock (purchased by public subscription about 1750) and the Fire Bell. In later refurbishments this clock was re-housed in St Peter's Church Tower. The Town Stocks were also placed in the Market Place and local offenders (and those who refused to go to church) were placed in them. The want of a market house was remedied, in a makeshift fashion, by Sir Henry Peyton (who was the Lord of the Manor of Doddington). His building, however, was only by , and provided only 14 stalls under cover. After the opening of the railway in 1847 another attempt was made to increase the market. In 1851 the market had been said to be \\"making progress\\"; and ¬£150 was subscribed to give a treat to the poor at its reopening. The clash with other market days was solved in December 1856 by changing market day from Friday to Wednesday \\"by private arrangement and without any formalities\\". The tolls were, however, collected in an arbitrary and haphazard way; they were assessed for poor rate purposes at ¬£10. Statute fairs for the hiring of servants took place each autumn, this was also an opportunity to socialise, and shows and ginger bread stalls were set up, the large numbers could also attract pickpockets. In 1872, the Board of Health bought a Shand and Mason fire engine that was the town's first steam appliance and was housed in the Market House. In the same year the vestry agreed to erect a urinal at the back of the Butter Cross for use by boys attending the Clock House School, but would not erect a water closet (toilet). The market toll-keeper in 1888, though he had no fixed scale of charges and kept no record of receipts, was said to be taking about ¬£50 a year. The success and prosperity of the market fluctuated over the years and an attempt by the Local Board to purchase the market rights to mark Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee of 1887 was a failure. However, in 1897, Sir Algernon Peyton agreed to sell the market rights, the Market Place and Market House to March Urban District Council for ¬£800. At that time the market was leased to F. B. Phillips, who agreed to surrender his lease in 1898 subject to receiving the market tolls for one year without charge. The market rights passed to Fenland District Council following the local government reorganisation in 1974. The current (2020) market days are Wednesday and Saturday. Religion St Wendreda's ChurchThe inhabitants of the town are served by eleven churches.The angels under the roof of St Wendreda's church St Wendreda's Church St Wendreda, to whom the oldest church in the town is dedicated, is the town's own saint and March is the only known church dedication to her. She was a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon who may have been a daughter of King Anna of East Anglia (killed 654) one of the first Christian Kings of the kingdom of East Anglia. Two of her possible sisters, Etheldreda and Sexburgha, who were the abbesses of Ely and Minster-in-Sheppey respectively, are better known saints. She is also associated with Exning, Suffolk. The saint's relics were enshrined in gold in Ely Cathedral, until in 1016 they were carried off to battle in the hope they would bring victory to Edmund Ironside, the son of King Ethelred. But at the Battle of Ashingdon the army of King Canute captured the relics and he presented them to Canterbury Cathedral. In 1343 the relics were returned to March, but their final resting place is unknown. The church is known for its magnificent double-hammer beam roof with 120 carved angels; it is regarded as one of the best of its kind. John Betjeman described the church as \\"worth cycling 40 miles in a head wind to see\\". The church describes itself as an evangelical church \\"with an emphasis on biblical teaching\\". Other churches In Victorian times, other Church of England churches were built in March, nearer to where most of the inhabitants now lived. Thomas Henry Wyatt was responsible for the design of St John's (consecrated 1872), St Peter's (built 1881) and St Mary's (Westry, built 1874). The four March Anglican churches now share a 'Team Ministry'. Trinity Church is now a joint Methodist and United Reformed Church. It was built as a Methodist church in the late 19th century to replace the small St Paul's Methodist Chapel in Gas Road. Development work was carried out during the late 1980s to convert St Paul's Methodist Church into Trinity Church by joining together St Paul's, the United Reformed Church, and the Primitive Methodist church. Centenary Baptist Church, founded in 1700, is a member of the Baptist Union. Additionally, there is a Grace Baptist church, Providence Baptist, which was rebuilt in 1873. An Elim Pentecostal Church meets in March Community Centre. March Evangelical Fellowship meets on Upwell Road. Fenland Community Church is unique in the local area in focussing on the needs of people with learning difficulties. Roman Catholics are served by weekly masses in the Anglican church in Chatteris, the combined parish of March and Chatteris being dedicated to Our Lady of Good Counsel and St Peter. March Museum March has its own museum, located on the High Street. It is in the building that was originally the South District Girls School, constructed in the 1850s, it went from school to school, until 1976 when the building was purchased by the Town Council. The Museum was opened in 1977. It is open every Saturday and Wednesday from 10:30 ‚Äì 15:30 and contains a vast amount of local memorabilia, both from March, and its surrounding villages. Such artefacts include the clock face from the Church of St Mary, Benwick and a large collection of cameras. Transport=Rivers The town is on either side of the River Nene (Old Course). A narrow boat marina provides berths and boats for hire. Roads The town now has a western bypass to take the A141 and some of the traffic away from the town centre. The B1099 and B1101 pass through the town. Railways The town was an important railway centre, with a major junction between the Great Eastern Railway and Great Northern Railway at March railway station. The station is from London by rail, north of Cambridge, north west of Ely and south of Wisbech. Whitemoor marshalling yards, built in the 1920s and 30s, were once the second largest in Europe, and the largest in Britain. They were gradually phased out during the 1960s and shut down in 1990. HM Prison Whitemoor was built on part of the site. The natural regeneration of the remaining 44 hectares resulted in its classification as a potential country park. In addition, a new housing development was constructed adjacent to the site. However, in 2002, Network Rail identified a need for a supply depot and redeveloped part of the site. The tracks of the March to Wisbech line remain and currently (2019) a review is taking place to assess reopening the Bramley Line. The line has been identified as a priority for reopening by the Campaign for Better Transport. March March march The \\"March March march\\" is a 30-mile walk from March to Cambridge, which has been walked in the month of March by students and academics from the University of Cambridge since 1979.
