The film analyzes policy changes made during the Bush Administration, and makes the case that these changes threaten American democracy. Synopsis The End of America details the ten steps a country takes when it slides toward fascism. The film takes a historical look at trends in once-functioning democracies from modern history, based on Wolf's 2007 book The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot. The films asserts such trends are being repeated in America today, and puts the recent gradual loss of civil liberties in the U.S. in a historical context. \\"The average American might not be alarmed at AT&T; selling our private information to the Bush administration, but when this action is seen as part of a larger series of erosions and events, a pattern emerges with unfortunate consequences that become disturbingly clear.\\" Style The film's style is similar to that of An Inconvenient Truth in that Wolf presents a lecture, filmed with multiple cameras, to an interactive audience. Break-away segments featuring both talking-head and \\"fly on the wall\\" interviews demonstrate the historical echoes and present-day consequences of the erosion of America's Constitution. These interviews are from a diverse collection of individuals, including intelligence community top brass, who are willing to talk on camera about the uselessness of \\"intelligence\\" gained through torture. The film also features grassroots political leaders, military generals, and victims of undermined civil liberties. The Ten Steps Wolf outlines ten steps that \\"closing societies\\" ‚Äî such as Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, and Stalin's Russia ‚Äî have historically followed. These steps, Wolf claims, are being observed in America now. The steps are: # Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy. # Create secret prisons where torture takes place. # Develop a thug caste or paramilitary force not answerable to citizens. # Set up an internal surveillance system. # Harass citizens' groups. # Engage in arbitrary detention and release. # Target key individuals. # Control the press. # Treat all political dissidents as traitors. # Suspend the rule of law Distribution The End of America is viewable online free of charge.

It is a distinctive style in its own right within Gothic Revival architecture that emerged primarily in Britain, its colonies and North America, during the nineteenth century.Rosman (2003) p.261 The style In contrast to the pure copying of English Gothic that was being advocated and promoted by some influential ecclesiologists during the early Gothic Revival period in Britain, most particularly by Augustus Welby Pugin and to an extent in the pages of the Camden Society's quarterly journal (The Ecclesiologist, 1841‚Äì68), Dissenting Gothic provided a less Anglo-centric interpretation of the Gothic style, and purposefully introduced modernising elements to meet clients' needs. In Dissenting Gothic, the interests of good design could over-ride historical purity; the role of the architect was seen as originating a design solution, rather than promoting specific Gothic forms as a cause c√©l√®bre in pursuit of an idealised high church and mediaeval belief system. Departing from the narrow confines of the approach adopted by some of the leading British ecclesiologists during the early Gothic Revival period, architects who were willing to respond to the demand for Dissenting Gothic enlarged their portfolio, drawing on mainland European Gothic architecture as well as English forms.Rosman (2003) p.261 Moreover, they could be more creative about relationship between form and function, seeking novel but appropriate ways to introduce elements not found in mediaeval Gothic churches, so as to create interiors that met the particular congregational needs of the independent or nonconformist chapel-builders of the nineteenth century;Powell (1980) accommodate Sunday Schools and meeting rooms, with sometimes distorting effects on the physiognomy of the building; use confined city plots in efficient ways by varying from strict gothic floorplans and orientations; and experiment with a wide range of materials, and polychromatic designs, not found in mediaeval buildings. Early Gothic Revival period Although the earliest examples of Dissenting Gothic were commissioned by trustees of independent churches and chapels at about the same time as the beginnings of the purist Anglo-Catholic-dominated Gothic Revival movement, namely during the second quarter of the 19th century, the latter so profoundly dominated and led this early period of 'Gothic Revival' that there were relatively few examples in Britain or elsewhere of Dissenting Gothic before the third quarter of that century. This limited use of Dissenting Gothic in the early Gothic Revival period of the second quarter of the century, reflected a marked reluctance by trustees and sponsors of independently funded and managed churches or chapels (in Britain, commonly referred to as 'nonconformist' churches or chapels) to commission neo-Gothic whilst the ecclesiologists were portraying it as ‚Äòhigh church‚Äô architecture. Equally, there was a refusal by some 'Gothic Revival' architects to accept commissions for ‚Äòlow church‚Äô buildings, including nonconformist chapels. For philosophical reasons, some architects in the early 'Gothic Revival' period considered that the style should remain the exclusive preserve of the ‚Äòhigh church‚Äô. Later Gothic Revival period By the mid- nineteenth century, these early controversies had weakened. In England, the case for commissioning neo-Gothic designs for nonconformist chapels was persuasively argued by the trained architect and Wesleyan Methodist minister Frederick James Jobson (commonly styled, F. J. Jobson), in his book Chapel and School Architecture (1850); and in America by the Rev. George Bowler's publication setting out examples of elevations and floor plans for nonconformist churches in the Gothic revival style.Bowler (1856) By then, it was becoming fashionable to adopt neo-Gothic for artistic reasons and intrinsic appeal alone, superseding its early associations with ‚Äòhigh church‚Äô buildings and their clients. Also, for more prosaic reasons, ‚Äò'Dissenting Gothic'‚Äô began to become commonplace from the mid-nineteenth century onwards; by that date, the trustees of independent chapels could more easily afford the high building costs associated with the neo-Gothic style. For example, in Britain the 1851 census recorded, for the first time, a greater number of people attending independent chapels than Anglican churches; the higher level of philanthropic donations and membership fees this provided, could now become reflected in more costly building designs. By the time the Gothic Revival had matured into a commonly accepted building style for all manner of building types (referred to as the \\"High Victorian Gothic\\" period (1855‚Äì85) in Britain), the influence of the ecclesiologists with their vision of neo-Gothic as befitting only high church buildings and favouring only pure 'English Gothic' forms with historically correct mediaeval detail, had passed by. This later 'Gothic Revival' period saw a willingness to innovate by many influential architects, reflecting the success of the less narrow approach of Dissenting Gothic. The architect James Cubitt embodied such forward-looking principles in his book Church Design for Congregations (1870), in which he noted the unsuitability of the conventional Gothic plan for nonconformist chapels, adding \\"there is every reason why our churches should be fitted for their destined use. It is not enough that they can be used....\\" His book gave further encouragement to looking at models besides traditional 'English Gothic', referring for example, to designs from Santa Sophia, Torcello, Gerona and Cologne. Amongst these, northern European Brick Gothic was perhaps the best known alternative to English styles at that time; partly on account of its lower cost than stone blocks, but also its appeal to a section of nonconformist though to whom highly extravagant and ornamented building styles and monuments were either too vulgar, or associated with mediaeval superstition - Spurgeon cautioned against the Gothic fashion leading to \\"hobgoblins and monsters on the outside of their preaching houses\\".Bebbington (1989) p.148-9 In Australia, Dissenting Gothic became known as \\"Victorian Free Gothic\\" and whilst the established Protestant Church followed its English counterpart in favouring \\"Academic Gothic\\", the independent or nonconformist denominations often chose Victorian Free Gothic. They more freely experimented with picturesque silhouettes and polychromatic surfaces; taking more from Ruskin's interest in 'impure' Gothic styles and the artistic merits of Gothic, than from Pugin's High Church and mediaevalist approach.Victorian Free Gothic (Sydney Architecture) As the nineteenth century wore on, Dissenting Gothic became widespread not only as old chapels were rebuilt, but also amongst the new city suburbs that were being established in England and elsewhere. for example, as Clark (2001) p.795 notes: \\"'Dissenting Gothic' was the style in Bowden, 'Manchester's most relaxed suburb'\\". Nonetheless its appeal amongst independents or nonconformists was not universal. The Baptists, quite unlike the Wesleyan Methodists and most notably the Unitarians, did not come to a generally accepted accommodation of the neo-Gothic style Homan (2006) p. 84 and indeed Spurgeon advanced the idea that the Grecian style was most appropriate for church buildings because the New Testament was written in Greek. His London Metropolitan Tabernacle of 1861 dramatically illustrated this alternative view.Bebbington (1989) p. 148‚Äì49 Buildings of note Fine examples of Dissenting Gothic include: * The Union Chapel, on Upper Street, Islington, London - by James Cubitt (1877-9) * The Abney Park Chapel, Stoke Newington, London - by William Hosking FSA and his client George Collison (1838‚Äì40) * St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, St. James' Street, London - by William Thomas (1854) * The Unitarian Chapel/Welsh Baptist Chapel/Islamic Academy, Upper Brook Street, Manchester - by Charles Barry (1837‚Äì39) * Mill Hill Chapel, Leeds - by Bowman & Crowther (1847‚Äì48) * The Unitarian Chapel, Gee Cross, Hyde, Cheshire - by Bowman & Crowther (1846‚Äì48) - a commission refused by Pugin * Cavendish Street Congregational Church, Chorlton-on- Medlock, Manchester - by Edward Walters (1847‚Äì48) (demolished) * Friar Lane Congregational Chapel, Nottingham (1828) * St. Matthew's United Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia (1857) References =Citations=   Further reading * Cherry, Bridget, ed.

Attracted by the natural beauty of the area, about 100 artists, sculptors, writers, designers, and politicians lived there either full-time or during the summer months. With views across the Connecticut River Valley to Mount Ascutney in Vermont, the bucolic scenery was considered to resemble that of an Italian landscape. The central figure of the Cornish Colony was Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Beginning around 1885, Augustus attracted a summer colony of artists that grew into a single extended social network. Some were related, some were friends, some were promising students from the Art Students League of New York that Saint-Gaudens had co-founded, and some were Saint-Gaudens' assistants who developed significant careers of their own. After his death in 1907 it slowly dissipated. His house and gardens are now preserved as Saint- Gaudens National Historic Site. Though the colony's name referred to its social center in the village of Cornish, geographically it was spread out over the villages of Windsor, Vermont and Plainfield, New Hampshire as well. Windsor was the mailing address for the entire area and the arrival point of most of the colonists, who usually came from New York City by train.

Midkiff was nicknamed \\"Salt Rock\\" due to his birthplace of Salt Rock, West Virginia. Major League career Midkiff, seated 2nd from right on middle row, in a team picture for the New York Yankees in 1913. Midkiff was 26 years old when he made his Major League debut on October 5, 1909, with the Cincinnati Reds. After spending time in the minor leagues, Midkiff was acquired by the Highlanders from the San Antonio Bronchos of the Texas League in 1912. Midkiff spent 1913 as the starting third baseman for the Yankees, but Fritz Maisel took the job midway through the season, and Midkiff was sold to the minor league Baltimore Orioles in August. Minor league career In 1914, Midkiff was a teammate of Babe Ruth before Ruth came to the majors. After parts of two seasons in Baltimore, Midkiff ended the 1914 season with the Louisville Colonels of the American Association. In May 1915, Midkiff was named the Colonels' manager. Midkiff, who was at the time suffering from a broken ankle, was named Manager of the club in place of John F. Hayden. At the end of the season, Midkiff was let go, and signed with the Memphis Chickasaws of the Southern Association.

The first newspaper to be published in Sheffield to see any degree of success was the Sheffield Weekly Journal in 1754. This was bought out in 1755 by the Sheffield Weekly Register, and was thereafter published in Doncaster.J. E. Vickers, A Popular History of Sheffield Sheffield Register The Sheffield Register was the next newspaper to be established in the town. It was founded by Joseph Gales, a Unitarian, who supported various Radical causes, advocating religious tolerance, Parliamentary reform and the abolition of slavery, and opposed boxing and bull-baiting.\\"Gales, Joseph\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Gales met Tom Paine, who encouraged him to found a radical newspaper. In June 1787, he began publishing the Sheffield Register, initially in partnership with David Martin,R. E. Leader, Reminiscences of Sheffield from offices in Hartshead. The newspaper focussed on reporting local news, and on reprinting tracts by reformers such as Paine and Joseph Priestley. This was a novelty, as most provincial newspapers of the day simply reprinted stories from the London press. In 1789, Martin left the partnership. Gales' politics became more prominent, and the newspaper celebrated the French Revolution and acted as the mouthpiece of the Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information, an artisan-based political organisation established by Gales in 1791 which called for radical reforms. The Register was extremely popular in the early 1790s, selling up to 2,000 copies of each issue. Gales established a companion fortnightly political journal, The Patriot, in 1792. The same year, the poet James Montgomery was appointed as clerk and bookkeeper for the newspaper offices.\\"Montgomery, James\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1794, the Government began arresting leaders of the Corresponding Societies, and Gales wrote articles decrying this. Gales was suspected of writing a letter offering to sell pikes to the London society, but was on business in Derby when troops arrived to arrest him.Marjorie Bloy, The Sheffield Corresponding Society Alarmed as to his safety, Gales published his final issue of the Register, before fleeing to Hamburg in Germany. His wife Winifred remained behind to sell the Register to Montgomery, who relaunched the newspaper as the Sheffield Iris and adopted a less radical editorial line. Montgomery initially used capital supplied by the Unitarian minister Benjamin Naylor. Sheffield Iris Despite moderating the newspaper's line, Montgomery was prosecuted for sedition in 1795 for publishing a poem on a handbill which celebrated the fall of the Bastille, and was sentenced to three months in prison. On his release, he negotiated Naylor's withdrawal and became sole proprietor. In August, he wrote a report offering mild criticism of an incident in Norfolk Street, where a popular protest was attacked by a militia, resulting in two deaths. He was again prosecuted, this time for malicious libel, and was imprisoned for six months. While he was in prison, John Pye-Smith took over as editor, and kept the paper running.Bibliographical Society, 2002-2003 On Christmas Eve 1816 the paper published Montgomery's carol, \\"Angels from the Realms of Glory\\", which was to become one of the most popular Christmas carols sung in England. The Iris remained a successful newspaper, but Montgomery developed other interests and, in the face of increased competition, from the Sheffield and Rotherham Independent and the Sheffield Mercury, he sold it in to local bookseller John Blackwell in 1825. Blackwell appointed the poet John Holland as editor, and despite frequently expressing his dislike for the role, Holland spent much of the rest of his life as a newspaper editor.J. H. Stainton, The Making of Sheffield, 1865-1914 (1924) The Iris ceased publication in 1848. A Sheffield Iris newspaper was briefly revived in 1855, following the removal of stamp duty, but lasted only until the following year.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~engsheffield/webpages/newspapers.htm References Category:Publications established in 1787 Category:Publications disestablished in 1848 Category:Defunct newspapers published in the United Kingdom Category:Mass media in Sheffield Category:1787 establishments in England ","title":"Sheffield Iris"},{"id":"20115830","text":"Robert Daniel Zehr, Sr. (April 18, 1916 ‚Äì August 4, 2001) was an American competition swimmer who represented the United States at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

Biography He was the son of Jonas M. Kilmer and Julia E. Sharpe, was a marketing pioneer, newspaperman, and horse breeder. Born in Brooklyn, New York, he graduated from Cornell University in 1890.\\"Cornell Alumni News, May 2, 1929\\" Kilmer was perhaps best known for advertising and promoting his uncle's Swamp Root patent medicine formula until it became a household name.Holbrook, Stewart. (1959). The Natural History of Swamp Root. In The Golden Age of Quackery. Collier Books. pp. 113-120 Dr. S. Andral Kilmer (1840‚Äì1924) developed the Swamp Root formula and began selling it around 1878. Three years later, Dr. Kilmer's brother Jonas (1843‚Äì1912) arrived from New York City to help run the fast- growing business. In 1892, Jonas bought out his brother and brought in his son Willis to direct marketing and advertising. Continued success led them to construct the six-story Kilmer Building at Lewis and Chenango Sts in downtown Binghamton, NY as their manufacturing and business headquarters in 1903. The Swamp Root formulation fell out of favor after the advent of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which resulted in the federal government imposing testing and labeling requirements on a variety of products, including patent medicines with dubious claims. Kilmer mausoleum in 2009 The Kilmer brother's Swamp Root formula was regarded as fraud and quackery by critics. Medical health experts noted that it was being advertised under false pretences, the formula was potentially dangerous and there was no evidence it could cure kidney or liver disease. The decline in the patent medicine business led Kilmer to branch out into other businesses. He was extensively involved in real estate, owning a landmark family mansion in Binghamton, NY, constructing the twelve story Press Building in downtown Binghamton as a home for another new business he created, The Binghamton Press Co., building several other less-prominent buildings in downtown Binghamton, and three racing stables and estates: Sun Briar Court in Binghamton, Court Manor in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and Remlik, on the banks of Virginia's Rappahannock River. Kilmer's private yacht Remlik (the name being Kilmer spelled backwards) was purchased by the US Navy during World War I and converted into the USS Remlik (SP-157) armed patrol vessel. Kilmer died in 1940 from pneumonia having amassed a fortune of some $15 million, mostly from the sale of the patent medicine Swamp Root tonic, which is still for sale today. After his death, Kilmer was interred at a mausoleum in Floral Park Cemetery in the Binghamton suburb of Johnson City, NY. Thoroughbred racing Kilmer was the breeder of Reigh Count, the winner of the 1928 Kentucky Derby. He was the owner of Exterminator, the winner of the 1918 Kentucky Derby and 1922 American Horse of the Year, and the breeder and owner of Sun Briar, the largest money maker until Seabiscuit in 1939. Both Exterminator and Sun Briar were elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Two other well known stallions were Sun Briar- an ancestor of both Secretariat and Affirmed; and Suntica. See also * Court Manor References Further reading *Holbrook, Stewart. (1959).

The collapse also destroyed several nearby homes. However, only the first and second floors were filled with students, and some students were in the playground area. The cause of the collapse remains officially unstated, but residents of the town have said they suspect poor-quality construction as a cause. The school had previously experienced a partial collapse in 2000, but it was rebuilt. After the first collapse, neighbors living downhill from the school abandoned their property out of fear that the building would fall onto their homes. The owner of the church-run school attempted to buy these vacated properties. In addition, the third floor of the building was under construction at the time of the 2008 collapse.

In an unequal battle, Windsor Castle, under the command of her acting captain William Rogers, not only defended repeated attacks from the privateer, but finally engaged her, boarded her and after overpowering the much larger crew, forced them below decks, and took the privateer as its prize. The victory was widely reported in contemporary papers and journals, and Rogers and his crew were hailed as heroes and lavishly rewarded for their valour. Background The Windsor Castle sailed from England under the command of Acting Captain William Rogers, bound for the Leeward Islands and Barbados in September 1807, carrying the mail. She carried six 4-pounder guns and two 9-pounder carronades and had a crew of 28 men and boys. Early on the morning of 1 October a sail was sighted and by half past eight the mystery ship was piling on sail to catch the packet. Identifying her as a privateer schooner, Rogers attempted to outrun the enemy, but she continued to close and he realised he would be compelled to fight. His enemy was the Jeune Richard, carrying six long 6-pounder guns and one long 18-pounder gun, a considerably heavier weight of shot than the Windsor Castle. The Jeune Richard also had a crew of 92, over three times that of the British packet. Battle A contemporary engraving of the sort that popularised Rogers' exploits. Rogers prepared for action and stood by to sink the mail should it become necessary to keep it out of enemy hands. By noon the Jeune Richard had closed the distance and, running up the French colours, she opened fire. The Windsor Castle returned fire, at which the French called on Rogers to surrender. He refused, so the Jeune Richard ran alongside the Windsor Castle deploying grappling irons, and attempted to board. The Windsor Castle‚Ä≤s crew mustered with pikes and repelled the boarders, killing or wounding between eight and ten of the French. The Jeune Richard‚Ä≤s crew attempted to cut the lines and pull away but the Windsor Castle‚Ä≤s main yard remained locked in the privateer's rigging, holding the two ships together. The fighting continued for several hours, but by 3pm one of the Windsor Castle‚Ä≤s 9-pounder carronades had been brought up on deck and loaded with double grape, canister and 100 musket balls. When the French made another attempt to force their way aboard, the British discharged it to great effect, sweeping the privateer's decks and causing considerable casualties and damage. Rogers then led five of his men onto the Jeune Richard and forced the French from their guns, driving them below after a fierce fight and securing control of the privateer. With the French crew trapped below but still considerably greater in number than the small British force that had control of the decks, Rogers ordered each Frenchman up on deck one at a time, where he had them placed in irons. Acting-Captain William Rogers, of the Windsor Castle. Aftermath With the Jeune Richard secured, Rogers took her and the Windsor Castle to the nearest British port. The British had three dead and ten wounded, the French had twenty-one dead and thirty-three wounded. Rogers then made his report to the officer commanding the station, Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. Cochrane forwarded his report to the Admiralty, adding an accompanying note: The news of how Rogers had turned upon his pursuer and taken her as his prize created a sensation. The account appeared in numerous newspapers, journals and periodicals. Societies and guilds joined to raise subscriptions to reward Rogers and his crew. In addition to sums of money, Rogers received two swords, a piece of plate worth 100 guineas, a vase worth ¬£60, and command of another packet ship. The artist Samuel Drummond painted Rogers' portrait, and also created a depiction of the action, while other engravers and artists produced versions to illustrate the stories carried in the papers.

Alsop.http://home.cogeco.ca/~scouse- one/alsop/schoolhistory.htm A Brief History of the School The school moved to its current premises on Queen's Drive in 1926. After World War II, further buildings were constructed - a dining annex, an assembly hall, a library and an art room, which was completed around 1953-4. Previously the Hall had been on the ground floor behind the front tower with windows onto the yard. When the new hall was opened, this area was converted into three classrooms onto the yard, and laboratories to the front onto Queens Drive. Further additions later included a new block with laboratories, a gym, and a metalwork shop. In recent years, the school also acquired the old Arnot Street school on County Road and adjacent to Arnot Street primary school. The lower school was designed by Gilling Dod, based in the Cunard Building, Liverpool. The lower school was demolished and the site has since been used to develop a Tesco Metro store and a car park.  Campus  Alsop High School is the largest secondary school in Liverpool at present. The current Alsop High School building was built in 1926, and an extensive refurbishment / backlog maintenance of the existing campus buildings began in September 2008. The campus recently benefited from the construction of a new ¬£8.4m building designed by architects 2020 Liverpool and includes a new canteen, new 6th form facilities, reception area, atrium, new Spanish, Humanities, and English learning pods as well as classroomswith improved IT facilities and a new dance and activity studio. The site has also benefited from extensive new landscaping and refurbishment of the listed rectory building. Aside from the Jamieson (named after a former headmaster) and 1926 buildings, there are also the MAD (Music, Art and Drama) block and the ICT block, which consists of the school's LRC (Learning Resource Center). The new landscaped play areas completed 2011 The new main entrance to Alsop High School The new Jamieson Building Curriculum The Alsop High School was awarded of Applied Learning status in 2006, allowing the school to offer a range of vocational subjects. In some subjects at Key Stage 3, students are taught in mixed ability classes, whilst in other subjects students are placed in teaching groups according to motivation, attainment and ability. All students at Key Stage 3 study English, mathematics, science, humanities, Spanish, PE, music, drama, art and design as well as PSHCE, picking up the additional subjects of IT and Technology in Years 8 and 9. Extracurricular activities The PE department runs activities that include athletics, badminton, basketball, boxing, cricket, fitness, football, hockey, netball, rounders, rugby, swimming, table tennis and trampolining. Other activities include art, dance, drama, Duke of Edinburgh's Award, guitar, keyboard, maths revision club, study club and Young Enterprise. In 2011, the Alsop Community Magazine was founded. Since then, it has published three editions of the free magazine which contains news about the school. It is distributed around the local primary schools and community by the contributors to the magazine, who are all Alsop pupils. You can view the articles on the school web page. In July 2012, Alsop High School was used to film part of episode 3 of Utopia, where a fictional school mass murder is filmed. This scene received 37 complaints to UK media regulator Ofcom, proving especially controversial as the scene aired only a month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Connecticut, USA. This caused Channel 4 to consider whether to carry on airing Utopia, yet carried on after much deliberation.

Life  Toby Maduot was born in Rualbet in Tonj North County in 1936, and after early studies in his native Tonj and secondary school at Ahfad in Omdurman, he completed his medical training at Charles University in Czechoslovakia. Following his return from Eastern Europe in 1965, he worked as a medical doctor in central Sudan and Khartoum, and then joined politics as a SANU member under the leadership of late William Deng Nhial. He held posts as a Minister at the Presidency in Khartoum in 1969, and then as the first Southern Commissioner of Bahr El-ghazal in 1971. After the Addis Ababa Agreement in 1972, he was elected to the People‚Äôs Assembly and named the first Minister of Health of the Southern Regional Government. He subsequently held the Information and Housing portfolios under the then High Executive Council for Southern Sudan. However, his greatest contribution was in his field as a Medical Doctor who selflessly served in the all corners of Sudan, and especially during the years of the second civil war when his clinic in El Haj Yousif in Khartoum was a sanctuary and refuge for thousands of displaced South Sudanese and other marginalized Sudanese living in the shantytowns of Khartoum. Dr. Maduot was a political philosopher and played an instrumental role in shaping the ideology of SANU which later gave birth to Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement. Working closely with his brother-in- law William Deng Nhial, one of Sudan's most important nationalist leaders in post-independence Sudan, he achieved recognition by the national government as they represented the first southern Sudanese political party. After the 1969 October Revolution, Dr. Maduot served in the cabinet and then was named Commissioner for Bahr al-Ghazal province in 1971. After the signing of the Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972, in which he played a key role, Dr. Maduot became a member of the Southern Region High Executive Council (HEC) as the Minister of Health in the first regional cabinet under Abel Alier, and was elected to the Regional Peoples Assembly. He was subsequently appointed by President Jaafar Nimeiri as the first South Sudanese Commissioner of Bahr elGhazal Region in 1971, and then held several cabinet posts in the HEC under both Abel Alier and Joseph Lagu. Dr. Maduot is a principled human rights activist, secularist thinker, and strong opponent of the war, enslavement, and other disasters that the government has been escalating against the People of Sudan. During the rise of the SPLM/A, Dr. Maduot was one of the few Southern leaders who remained in Khartoum and fought politically as he always did. He operated a small Medical Clinic in one of the most impoverished suburbs of Khartoum in Elhaj Yousif, and devoted himself to fighting for human rights and an end to the war in the South of the country from which most of his patients came. The Sudan government arrested Dr. Maduot continuously along with journalist Alfred Taban, lawyer Mustafa Abdel-Gadir, lawyer Ali Al-Sayed, and many other democratic leaders or professionals who honestly and publicly criticized the regime's repression, war mongering, and non-democracy. Maduot lived under intensive security surveillance before the peace agreement of 2005. He was repeatedly detained by the regime's security team for years in Khartoum. He was constantly harassed and interrogated but consistently refused to comply with the security team's unlawful procedure, which flagrantly violated international human rights law. On June 28, 2002 SHRO-Cairo issued a follow-up report addressed to the High Commissioner of Human Rights (Geneva), the African Commission on Human Rights (Banjul), and the other human rights organizations. Human rights worldwide call for the release of Dr. Toby Maduot after the government‚Äôs extension of his unlawful incarceration irrespective of his urgent need to medical attention at the time. Human rights and others became very involve and Dr. Toby became a known and respected figure as he peacefully shed light on the suffering of his people in Sudan. His Humanitarianism and commitment to democracy and human rights will remain his shining legacy for years to come. Late Dr. Toby Maduot was a husband to Mrs. Carmen Kwei Mawien, Late Mrs. Victoria Yar Arol (a pioneering politician in her own right), and Mrs. Sarah Paul Lako. 18 children and 12 grandchildren survive him. His body rests in Tonj, South Sudan.

Its format has changed over the years. Originally airing in July 1992 as a two-hour television program that aired the official UK Top 40 singles chart. The programme originally aired Mondays at 20:00 hrs (CET) and repeated through the week. In 1997, with the launch of localized MTV Europe channels in Germany, the UK and Italy the chart continued to air. In 2002, both MTV UK and MTV Italia discontinued the series, while MTV Europe continues to air the chart as a Top 20 playlist each week. MTV Germany stopped importing the original English series in July 2000, creating a German version of Hitlist UK, which was hosted by several German VJs up until 2004, when this version was eventually discontinued as well. From 1992 to 2002 the series was hosted by a number of MTV Europe VJ's, whereas the series has had no presenter since 2003. On August 1st, 2012 the UK Hitlist was suspended from programming on MTV Europe. As of January 1st, 2013 the UK Hitlist chart is back on MTV Europe ‚Äì Every Thursday.

For positions 40 to 21, 20 to 11 and 10 to 2 a rundown would be included, consisting of short extracts from all songs (if no video was available, the cd cover would be seen instead; in the rare case MTV had neither a video nor a cd cover, a \\"video not available\\" sign would be shown, combined with a kind of \\"no signal\\" TV noise). Sometimes, a video would not be shown although it had actually climbed the chart. Reasons for this would not be given, so why a song was neglected could only be assumed. In the case of Mr Blobby‚Äôs \\"Mr Blobby\\" and Manchester United Football Squad‚Äôs \\"Come On You Reds\\", both of which were number ones, one reason for showing just an excerpt of the video might have been that both records were intended for the UK market only. For some time, the show also included songs that missed the top 40 mainstream list but which were successful in other UK charts, such as the dance, rock, indie, \\"breakers\\" (i. e. singles just outside the top 40), or album chart.

He won a silver medal in the parallel bars at the 1996 Summer Olympics. After leaving competitive gymnastics, he became a real estate developer and founded Jair Lynch Development Partners in 1998. Early life Lynch was born October 2, 1971, in Amherst, Massachusetts. His father, Acklyn Lynch, was born on the island of Trinidad in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. He grew up in the neighborhood of Woodbrook in the city of Port of Spain, and was an avid soccer player in his youth. He spent most of his adult life in the United States, however, obtaining his bachelor degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C., and his Ph.D. in political science and economics from Harvard University. His father's political activism led the government of Trinidad and Tobago to declare him an \\"undesirable\\" in the 1970s. Dr. Lynch taught at Howard University before becoming a professor of political economy and African American studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. He later became chair of the Department of African Studies. Jair's mother, Martha Fernandez Lynch, was born in Bogot√°, Colombia, and obtained her bachelor's degree from Universidad de los Andes. She came to the United States and obtained her master's degree in economics from the School of Advanced International Studies in 1964. She returned to the Universidad de los Andes to conduct research for two years before coming back to Washington, D.C. The Lynches married in 1965. Martha Lynch joined the Brookings Institution in 1966, but left after a short time to become an economist with the Organization of American States (OAS). She left the OAS in 1989, and became an independent consultant. Her clients included a wide range of international organizations, including the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. Jair has a younger sister, Pilar. She graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's degree in dance from New York University, and became a dancer and teacher in film and theater studies. She previously performed with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. The Lynch family moved to Washington, D.C., when Jair was three years old. Jair Lynch grew up in the Shepherd Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where he attended Alexander Shepherd Elementary School. He evinced an early interest in architecture, and at the age of three was already replicating famous buildings in the city using Play-Doh and covering tables with cities he would build from Legos (his favorite toy). Although he enjoyed basketball, football, and soccer as a youth, his short height (he topped out at ) and lack of weight (just as an Olympic gymnast) mitigated against it. Yet he was extremely athletic. =Early involvement with gymnastics= Lynch became involved with gymnastics at the age of eight. At the age of 12, he predicted that he was going to be an Olympic athlete some day. Lynch was plagued with injuries before he turned 18. These included a broken ankle, arm, finger, hand, and wrist (both of them). In 1985, he began training with coach Rick Tucker at the Gymnastics Plus club in Columbia, Maryland. His father drove him to every gymnastics meet. They would listen to jazz and hip-hop music, and discuss art, music, and sports. At the 1987 USA Gymnastics' Junior Olympics, Lynch won the pommel horse championship. The following year, he compiled the highest score ever at the Junior Olympics. In 1990, he was the all-around men's champion at the meet. Lynch graduated from Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., and received a full-ride gymnastics scholarship from Stanford University. Gymnastics =College career= At Stanford University, Lynch was a member and captain of the 1992 and 1993 teams which won the NCAA Men's Gymnastics championship. He was coached by Sadao Hamada and David Juszczyk. He placed seventh in the all-around competition at the 1991 World Sports Fair. =Olympic career= At the 1992 United States Gymnastics Olympic Trials, Lynch played fourth in the all-around. Lynch became just the third African American to make the U.S. Olympic Team, and just the second to compete. At the 1992 Summer Olympics, Lynch finished sixth in the parallel bar competition and 60th in the all-around. The U.S. men's gymnastics team finished sixth overall. Lynch faced two major issues while preparing for the 1996 Olympic Summer Games. The first was a strength issue, which impaired his performance on the rings. The second was injuries. After the 1992 games, he suffered a broken left hand, ruptured sternum, and torn right rotator cuff. Lynch sought out Fred Stephens, the strength coach for the Stanford University football team. With Stephens' help, Lynch was able to significantly improve his upper body strength, which helped him to avoid further injury. Working with Sadao Hamada, coach for the 1992 men's Olympic gymnastic team, he developed routines which he felt more comfortable performing. At the American Cup gymnastics competition in early 1996, Lynch placed second. At the Coca- Cola National Championships, he placed first on the parallel bars. He finished sixth at the 1996 United States Gymnastics Olympic Trials after falling twice from the high bar. Lynch was elected captain of the 1996 U.S. men's gymnastics Olympic team. At the 1996 Olympic Summer Games, he won a silver medal on the parallel bars, becoming the first African American man to win an individual Olympic medal in gymnastics and only the second American man to earn an individual Olympic medal in a non-boycott year since 1976. =Post-competition gymnastics= Beginning in 2004, Lynch began serving on the board of directors of the United States Olympic Committee. He stepped down at the end of 2012. Business career Lynch graduated from Stanford University in 1994 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and in urban design. He was nominated for a Rhodes scholarship upon graduation. In 2006, Lynch was a Loeb Fellow at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. After graduating from Stanford, Lynch worked for three years in the real estate development arm of Silicon Graphics, a California-based computer company. Lynch moved back to Washington, D.C., and in 1998 founded Jair Lynch Development Partners, a Washington, D.C.-based real estate development firm. The company started out working on small projects such as community centers and low-income housing. In 2003, it won a contract to manage the District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation's $100 million capital investment program. The company received a $120 million investment from local real estate developer Victor MacFarlane in 2015, which allowed the firm to begin purchasing sites for development and to operate its own assets. Lynch has stated that his firm is interested in developing neighborhoods around the buildings it develops to help build a stable population. As of 2015, the firm had developed in and around the District of Columbia. =D.C. Olympic bids= Lynch was a member of the 2001 team which submitted the District of Columbia's bid for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games. He was also a member of the 2014 team which submitted the District's bid for the 2024 Olympic Summer Games. Personal life Lynch's lifelong role model is Jackie Robinson, the African American who broke down racial discrimination in baseball. Lynch is married to television and film producer Jocelyn Sigue. The couple had a daughter, Pilar, in 2009.

Martin played mostly as a forward, often in the pocket. He only made six appearances for Carlton in his debut season and the following year switched to Northcote. A strongly built and physical player, Martin returned to the league in 1907, with Essendon, playing there for the next seven years. Despite only kicking 16 goals in 1907, it was enough to top the goal-kicking at Essendon. He played in Essendon's losing 1908 Grand Final side and missed out on their 1911 premiership when he received a twelve-week suspension mid-season for striking George Holden of Fitzroy. Police later charged Martin with assault, making him the first VFL player to appear before the courts over an on-field incident. After playing in their premiership team in 1912 instead, Martin crossed to Holden's club during the 1913 season and participated in another premiership. This made him the first person in VFL history to play in consecutive premierships at two clubs, a feat later equaled by only Tom Fitzmaurice. Jim Martin died in Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1940.

He has served since 2004 as a Director of Research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). Work Lordon's work is an attempt to integrate Spinoza's concepts, such as conatus, into the study of political economy. As a participant in the current crises of capitalism, he debates publicly in France, proposing ostensible solutions. He is a member of ' (\\"Appalled Economists\\"), a group of economists formed in 2010 who reject mainstream economics' positions, such as the efficient-market hypothesis, etc. An early observer of the subprime mortgage crisis, he proposed the implementation of a tax he nicknamed SLAM, for Shareholder Limited Authorized Margin, the effect of which would be to limit profits so that profit making ventures in the real economy are not determined \\"only by the interests of the stock exchange market.\\" Lordon played an instrumental role in the rise of the Nuit debout movement. He wrote a piece in the February 2016 issue of Le Monde diplomatique on Fran√ßois Ruffin's film, Merci patron!, describing the film as a clarion call for a potential uprising. This prompted Ruffin to organise a public meeting which led to the organisation of the public occupation of Paris's Place de la R√©publique on 31 March 2016. Lordon spoke at the 31 March protest, highlighting the goals of disparate protest movements. He never talked to national media about his role in the movement, explaining that he did not wish to be seen as the leader of a leaderless movement, and so by denying that he was the leader, and pointing out that the movement is in fact leaderless, he deftly positioned himself as the voiceless head of a silent movement.

U-15 was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched in April 1915. She was commissioned in October 1915. U-15 was the most successful boat of the U-10 class, sinking six ships totaling more than . The boat survived the war and was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.  Design and construction  U-15 was constructed at AG Weser in Bremen for the Austro-Hungarian Navy and then shipped by rail in sections to the navy yard at Pola, where the sections were riveted together. Though there is no specific mention of how long it took for U-15s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine UB-3, shipped to Pola from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks.Messimer, p. 126‚Äì27.The Austro-Hungarian and the German Type UB I were virtually identical. U-15 was launched in April. U-15 was a small, coastal submarine that displaced surfaced and submerged. She featured a single shaft, a single Daimler diesel engine for surface running, and a single electric motor for submerged travel. U-15 was capable of up to while surfaced and while submerged at a diving depth of up to . She was designed for a crew of 17 officers and men. U-15 was equipped with two torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. In October 1916, U-15s armament was supplemented with a 37 mm/23 (1.5 in) quick- firing (QF) gun. This gun was replaced by a /33 QF gun in November 1917.  Operational history  SM U-15 was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 6 October under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Friedrich Schlosser. On 28 November, Linienschiffsleutnant Friedrich F√§hndrich was assigned to the first of two stints in command of the boat. On 18 December, F√§hndrich and U-15 attacked and sank two Albanian sailing vessels near Lezh√´. The Erzen, of , and the Figlio Preligiona, of , were both sunk at position . After being relieved by Linienschiffsleutnant Franz Rzemenowsky von Trautenegg from late March to early May 1916, F√§hndrich resumed command on 10 May. One week later, on 17 May, U-15 torpedoed and sank the Italian steamer in the Adriatic some east of Brindisi.Stura, launched in 1883, had sailed in passenger duty for Navigazione Generale Italiana between the Mediterranean and New York before the war. See: Immigration Information Bureau, pp. 8‚Äì9, 16, 23. The following month, F√§hndrich and the crew of U-15 scored their second double kill when they sank the Italian auxiliary cruiser () and the French destroyer Fourche (). While about east of Otranto on 23 June, U-15 torpedoed and sank Citt√° di Messina. The escorting destroyer Fourche began a depth charge attack on U-15 and assumed success when an oil slick appeared on the surface. After the captain of Fourche turned his attentions to the rescue Citt√° di Messinas survivors, U-15 launched a single torpedo that struck Fourche amidships and sank her.Compton-Hall, p. 230. On 25 October, U-15, back under the command of von Trautenegg, sank the Italian steamer , Helgason refers to the ship as \\"Polceverra\\", but Haworth, and Swiggum & Kohli identify the ship as \\"Polcevera\\".For Haworth, see: For Swiggum & Kohli, see: a sister ship to Stura (sunk by U-15 in May). Polcevera was the last ship sunk by U-15. From October 1916 to the end of the fighting in November 1918, U-15s activities are unknown. U-15 was at Pola at the end of the war when Austria-Hungary handed her over to Italy.Gibson and Pendergast, p. 388. U-15 was scrapped at Pola by 1920.

The fortifications of Riga consisted of a wall with ditch and 5 bastions around the old town. In 1652 Swedes had started construction of a new wall with 12 bastions around suburbs, but by 1656 the work had not been completed. The Russian vanguard consisting of the Vladimir v. Vizin reiters, Daniel Krafert infantry and Iunkmann dragoons approached Riga on August 20 and threw back the Swedes under count of P√§rnu, Heinrich von Thurn into the city. Von Thurn was either killed, or captured in the action. The Swedes evacuated the suburbs and withdrew to the old town. A few days later, the main army under Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich arrived on the ships on the Duna River, and laid siege to Riga. The Russian army occupied three camps, two on the east bank of the Duna in Riga's suburbs, and a Corps under Ordyn- Nashokin on the west bank of the Duna, opposite the Kobrun entrenchment. As Russia had no full-fledged navy to intercept reinforcements coming to the Swedish garrison across the Baltic, Riga managed to hold out until October, when foreign officers commanding a small Russian flotilla defected to the other side and the Russians had to lift the siege. In the aftermath of this reverse, the Swedes recaptured much of Ingria, took the Pskov Monastery of the Caves and inflicted a heavy defeat on the Russian general Matvey Sheremetev at Valga in 1657. The events of the siege were recorded in an engraving by Adam Perelli that was first published in 1697 in Samuel Puffendorf's work, Konung Carl X Gustafs Bragder.

Early career  USS LST-1169 was laid down on 26 November 1952 at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, by the Christy Corporation. She was launched on 22 August 1953, sponsored by Mrs. John L. Clarkson of Lake Forest, Illinois, and commissioned on 14 September 1954 with Lieutenant Commander Frank S. Handler in command. After shakedown training in the Gulf of Mexico, LST-1169 departed New Orleans, Louisiana, on 13 October 1954, bound for her home port, Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia Upon arrival in the Tidewater, Virginia, area, she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, for an availability that lasted from 25 October 1954 to 4 November 1954. She then joined Landing Ship Tank Division 44, Squadron 4, Flotilla 2, Amphibious Force, United States Atlantic Fleet. For the remainder of 1954, LST-1169 operated locally in the Chesapeake Bay. Following a short availability at Norfolk Navy Yard between 5 January 1955 and 22 January 1955, LST-1169 made a run to Havana, Cuba, and, upon her return, reentered the shipyard for further work. She cleared Norfolk, Virginia, on 11 April 1955, bound for the Caribbean, and took part in amphibious warfare exercises at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, with a reconnaissance team embarked. During that deployment, LST-1169 visited Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands before heading home on 29 April 1955 with units of the 3rd Battalion of the United States Marine Corps's 10th Marine Regiment embarked. After debarking the Marines at Morehead City, North Carolina, LST-1169 pressed northward, reaching Norfolk on 6 May 1955. Except for a brief cruise to Boston, Massachusetts, between 14 June 1955 and 23 June 1955, LST-1169 remained at Little Creek well into the summer of 1955. Renamed USS Whitfield County (LST-1169) on 1 July 1955, she remained engaged in local operations into 1956, a year in which she underwent an overhaul at Norfolk Navy Yard between 21 January 1956 and 23 May 1956. She then operated in the Chesapeake Bay and off the Virginia Capes until 13 August 1956, when she got underway for the United States West Coast. After skirting a Caribbean hurricane, she transited the Panama Canal on 20 August 1956. Shortly after leaving Rodman Naval Station, Panama Canal Zone, Whitfield County suffered an explosion and fire. The repairs necessitated by that accident delayed her arrival at her new home port, San Diego, California, until 5 September 1956. Upon arrival at San Diego, Whitfield County became flagship for Landing Ship Tank Division 12, an assignment that soon changed when she was transferred to Landing Ship Tank Division 11. She soon commenced a regular slate of divisional and squadron exercises out of San Diego that stretched into August 1957. Whitfield County departed San Diego on 13 August 1957 to begin her first deployment to the Western Pacific (WestPac). She called at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, between 24 August 1957 and 4 September 1957 and reached Yokosuka, Japan, on 16 September 1957. A little over a week later, she proceeded to Camp McGill to load vehicles and embark troops for the first of several amphibious exercises. After maneuvers at Okinawa, Whitfield County returned her passengers and cargo to Fukuoka, Japan, before she visited Sasebo, Japan, en route to Yokosuka, where she arrived on 11 October 1957. On 14 October 1957, Whitfield County sailed to Iwakuni, Japan, to pick up troops for additional landing exercises at Okinawa, returning to Yokosuka on 31 October 1957. She departed Japanese waters on 3 November 1957 and reached Son Gap To, South Korea, soon thereafter, beaching on 7 November 1957 and 8 November 1957 to load cargo that she returned to Yokosuka on 12 November 1957. On 18 November 1957, after again loading troops and vehicles, Whitfield County sailed for Okinawa, offloading her cargo upon arrival and taking on board units of the 12th Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division. Whitfield County arrived at Dingalan Bay, Luzon, the Philippines, on 30 November 1957 and served as the base for a reconnaissance team during amphibious exercises that lasted until 10 December 1957. She then joined elements of the United States Seventh Fleet at sea for exercises which kept her busy until she arrived at Subic Bay, the Philippines, on 26 December 1957. Whitfield County remained there into 1958 before steaming to Naha, Okinawa, on 4 February 1958, for the first of two voyages lifting Marines and their vehicles. She arrived back at Dingalan Bay on 26 February 1958 for exercises in which she acted as receiving ship for simulated battle casualties. On 8 March 1958, Whitfield County headed for the U.S. West Coast and reached San Diego on 31 March 1958. Between 14 April 1958 and 3 May 1958, Whitfield County underwent an overhaul at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Corporation, San Diego. She then operated off the southern California coast into the summer. Her routine was broken late in July 1958 during the crisis in Lebanon, when American armed forces went on alert for a global posture of readiness. During that time, she cruised to Pearl Harbor between 25 July 1958 and 20 August 1958, after which time she resumed her regular routine out of San Diego. Shifting to San Francisco and later to Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, and Alameda, California, Whitfield County underwent an overhaul at the Todd Shipyards Corporation in preparation for the ship's second Western Pacific deployment. She sailed for the Far East on 23 April 1959, called at Pearl Harbor en route, and reached Yokosuka on 22 May 1959. She then visited Hong Kong between 9 June 1959 and 16 June 1959 and returned to Sasebo on 21 June 1959, via Naha, Okinawa. She then lifted landing vehicles tracked (LVTs) to Chinhae, South Korea, between 22 June 1959 and 28 June 1959 before returning to Sasebo. Subsequently, loading elements of the 3rd Marine Division at Naha on 6 July 1959, Whitfield County transported the Marines to Numazu, Japan, arriving there a week later. Shifting to Yokosuka shortly thereafter, Whitfield County remained there into August 1959, undergoing needed upkeep and conducting local operations. Underway for Inchon, South Korea, on 5 August 1959, Whitfield County rendezvoused with other units of Landing Ship Squadron 1 and took part in Operation Seahorse, a full-scale joint amphibious exercise with embarked units of the United States Army's 7th Cavalry Regiment. En route to the maneuver site, Whitfield County evaded Typhoon Ellen. Embarking the elements of the 7th Cavalry at Inchon soon after her arrival on 12 August 1959, Whitfield County sortied for Pohang Dong, on the coast of South Korea, to take part in Operation Seahorse. Whitfield County proved to be the only landing ship tank involved, because the other units of Landing Ship Squadron 1 had been unable to reach the area due to typhoon evasion maneuvers. Visiting Otaru and Hakodate, Japan, at the end of August 1959 as part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's People-to-People Program, Whitfield County was en route to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, for routine training evolutions with amphibious tractor units of the 3rd Marine Division when she was diverted for contingency loading at Naha, Okinawa. She received those orders in light of a developing crisis in the landlocked kingdom of Laos. Whitfield County remained in a high state of readiness in the Okinawa area from 7 September 1959 to 12 October 1959. She steamed between Naha and Buckner Bay during that time and also conducted routine training evolutions, making one transit of the Taiwan Strait and evading five typhoons. During that period, the ship earned a well-done from Commander, Amphibious Squadron 1, for her contributions to relief efforts for Japanese victims of Typhoon Vera (1959). Ordered to Sasebo on 12 October 1959, Whitfield County underwent voyage repairs there. She cleared that port on 2 November 1959, bound for the U.S. West Coast, and reached San Diego on 24 November 1959. She then remained at her home port in leave and upkeep status for the remainder of 1959. Following local operations out of her home port into the summer of 1960, including participation in Operation Swandive, held off Camp Pendleton on 8 February 1960 and 9 February 1960, and Operation Bigtop, held between 2 May 1960 and 10 May 1960, Whitfield County got underway for her third Western Pacific tour. After stopping briefly at Pearl Harbor between 22 June 1960 and 26 June 1960, she joined Landing Ship Squadron 9 in Japan on 1 July 1960. Home-ported then at Yokosuka, Japan, Whitfield County would remain in the Far East until 1973. Her operating schedule reflected the growing American involvement in the affairs of Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam. Whitfield County spent the better part of August 1960 conducting independent ship exercises and transporting Marines between Naha and Numazu and back. She also engaged in the usual typhoon evasions common to operations in that area of the world. In September 1960, she departed Yokosuka for a six-week cruise that was slated to take her to Okinawa, Hong Kong, and Subic Bay, but, soon after leaving Okinawa, she received word to report to Subic Bay. There, she rendezvoused with landing ship tank and set out for Singapore in the Federated Malay States, on 26 September 1960. Reaching Singapore on 30 September 1960, the two landing ships tank embarked 600 Malayan troops and their gear, part of a United Nations (UN) force assigned peacekeeping duties in the turbulent Belgian Congo. Departing Singapore on 3 October 1960, Whitfield County and Windham County tarried briefly at Port Swettenham, Federation of Malaya, to complete the loading and embarkation process begun at Singapore. On 4 October 1960, the two amphibious ships departed Port Swettenham, bound for the port of Matadi, located on the Congo River. The ships steamed for 27 consecutive days, crossing the Indian Ocean, rounding the Cape of Good Hope on 22 October 1960, and reaching the mouth of the Congo River on 31 October 1960. They then ascended the river some to Matadi. After disembarking the 600 troops and their equipment, the two ships departed Matadi on 2 November 1960. They arrived at Cape Town, South Africa, on 11 November 1960. They then visited Singapore and Hong Kong before returning to Yokosuka on 20 December 1960. Whitfield County spent the remainder of 1960 in port there. From 1961 through mid-1964, Whitfield County continued her operations out of Sasebo and ranged from Okinawa to Japan, with port visits at Japanese ports, and to Hong Kong. She also operated upon occasion at Subic Bay.  Vietnam War  In mid-1964, the tempo of operations for the tank landing ship began to change, reflecting the increased role that the United States was playing in Vietnam. On 22 July 1964, Whitfield County departed Yokosuka for a routine trip to Okinawa, but was called away for duty off the coast of Vietnam. She remained at sea for 41 days with Marines embarked, on station off the coast of South Vietnam and ready for contingencies. During that time, the Tonkin Gulf Incident occurred early in August 1964 and further escalated tensions between the United States and North Vietnam. Whitfield County returned to Yokosuka early in October 1964 for much- needed leave and upkeep. She next conducted type training, made a troop lift from Numazu to Okinawa, and underwent more upkeep in November and December 1964, before rounding out the year in readiness to operate in South Vietnamese waters once more if the situation demanded it. With a logistical support load on board, Whitfield County departed Okinawa, bound for South Vietnam. She arrived at Da Nang on 5 January 1965 and offloaded part of the cargo before shifting to Chu Lai to discharge the remainder. She sailed for Subic Bay on 6 January 1965,The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry for Whitfield County (see http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship- histories/danfs/w/whitfield-county.html) specifies this date as being in 1965, but does not associated any dates with a specific year again until mentioning 7 January 1967 later in the text. A careful reading of the text between these two specific correlations of a year with the date mentioned suggests that details of the ship's history in 1965 and 1966 are vague, or even that a year of the ship's history is missing; a sequential interpretation of the association of the date mentioned with either 1965 or 1966 suggests a missing year in either 1965 or 1966. The ship's battle stars, detailed toward the end of this article, suggest that she was in Japan and out of action in mid-1966, but even that does not clarify which dates belong to which years or whether part of the ship's history is missing. The vague text from the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Shipshas been left in this article verbatim; clarification will have to await further research. as part of the Subic-South Vietnam shuttle force. Arriving at Subic Bay on 9 January, she took on a load of cargo earmarked for Vietnamese ports and sailed for Da Nang on 16 January with another logistical support load on board. After unloading that cargo at Da Nang, Whitfield County shifted to Cam Ranh Bay, to load cargo for transport to Phan Rang and Saigon. Ultimately reaching Saigon on 28 January and unloading the remaining cargo, she took on board cargo to be lifted to Qui Nh∆°n, South Vietnam. Subsequently, routed onward to Okinawa after loading cargo at Da Nang, she reached Okinawa on 10 February. Taking on board elements of the U.S. Army's 4th Cavalry Regiment, Whitfield County proceeded to Saigon, reaching that port on 20 February. After returning to Okinawa, via Da Nang and Keelung, Taiwan, Whitfield County subsequently steamed back to Vietnamese waters with elements of the 1st Marine Division embarked and put the Marines ashore at Chu Lai. She continued her busy pace of operations, carrying return cargo from Da Nang to Okinawa, arriving at Okinawa on 2 April, before she embarked U.S. Marine Corps elements for maneuvers at Numazu. Reaching her destination on 6 April, she immediately disembarked the Marines and returned to Yokosuka for overhaul. Following that yard work and the ensuing refresher training, Whitfield County remained at Yokosuka through much of the summerThe ship's battle star details, provided later in this article, suggest that this was the summer of 1966, although the way the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry for Whitfield County (see http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship- histories/danfs/w/whitfield-county.html) is written makes is impossible to discern which dates belong to 1965 and which to 1966 during the period between 5 January 1965 and 7 January 1967 before sailing for Iwakuni, Japan, and arriving there on 27 August to load equipment and embark men of Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) 13 for transfer to South Vietnam. Underway on 29 August, Whitfield County reached Chu Lai on 6 September. She then returned to Japan and made a second trip from Iwakuni to Chu Lai, bringing in the second element of MAG-13. Whitfield County proceeded thence to Da Nang to embark elements of Marine Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 1st Battalion, 9th Marines for passage to Okinawa. She then proceeded to Naha, where she took on board the men and equipment of the Army's 526th Engineering Detachment. Offloading at Qui Nh∆°n, the ship shifted to Chu Lai and Da Nang, where she loaded return equipment and sailed for Okinawa. Upon delivering her equipment to Okinawa, she pushed on for Japan and reached Yokosuka on 24 October. Whitfield Countys upkeep period in Japan lasted into November, when she headed for Hong Kong and six days of rest and recreation. Departing on 23 November, Whitfield County proceeded to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, where she loaded 600 tons of cement slated for transport to South Vietnam. Reaching Phan Rang on 30 November, she offloaded her cargo and departed on 1 December, bound for Da Nang. The normally short trip became a four-day voyage after she ran into heavy weather soon after leaving Phan Rang, but she finally reached Da Nang on 5 December, and took on board equipment for lift to Okinawa. After first offloading the retrograde cargo at Naha, Whitfield County reached her home port of Yokosuka on 15 December, and remained there into late December. = 1967 = Whitfield County sailed for Vietnamese waters on 29 December, bound for V≈©ng T√†u and her first deployment with riverine forces. Slated to join River Assault Flotilla 1, Whitfield County arrived at V≈©ng T√†u on 7 January 1967,This specific correlation of a year to a date is the first one in the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry for Whitfield County (see ) since 5 January 1965, and for the first time since then makes clear which year should be associated with which dates. Clarification of the ship's history between 5 January 1965 and 7 January 1967 with respect to which dates are associated with 1965 and which are associated with 1966 will have to await further research; meanwhile, the dates correspond poorly, and it is possible a year of the ship's history is missing from the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry. embarked a river pilot and one River Assault Flotilla liaison officer and proceeded up the muddy Long Tau River to Saigon. She subsequently beached at Newport South Ramp that evening and remained there until 10 January 1967, embarking men and equipment of River Assault Flotilla I. Departing Saigon on 10 January 1967, Whitfield County arrived at V≈©ng T√†u late that same evening. The next day she began providing messing, berthing, and logistical support for the men of the river assault force and the 1,800 troops from the U.S. Army's 9th Division, who were training with the riverine forces. On 26 February 1967, Whitfield County weighed anchor and headed for Yokosuka, arriving there on 9 March 1967. On 5 April 1967, she got underway for Okinawa to load cargo for South Vietnam. A port visit slated for 11 April 1967 at Keelung, Taiwan, was cancelled due to the urgent need for landing ships tank for the impending Operation Oregon. Whitfield County sped to Chu Lai, reached that port on 15 April 1967, and discharged her cargo upon arrival. She then took on board 92 tons of vehicles, 200 officers and men, and the cargo of a Marine Corps headquarters battalion; and proceeded to Da Nang, where she arrived on 16 April 1967. Offloading upon her arrival, Whitfield County came under the operational control of Naval Support Activities (NavSuppAct) Da Nang to support Operation Oregon and remained in that status until 23 April 1967. During that time, she conducted two beachings at Chu Lai and transported a total of 1,300 tons of general cargo, munitions, and vehicles. Released from Operation Oregon on 23 April 1967, Whitfield County departed Chu Lai and headed toward the Philippines for type training and a visit to Manila. En route, however, dhr was ordered to proceed at \\"all best speed\\" to Subic Bay. Upon arrival there on 25 April 1967, she loaded cargo from attack cargo ship . Then, after picking up additional ammunition, Whitfield County got underway on 27 April 1967, bound for South Vietnam. On the morning of 30 April 1967, Whitfield County rendezvoused with Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) Alfa, consisting of amphibious assault ship , attack transport and landing ship dock , which was then conducting Operation Beaver Cage. The operation, an over-the-beach landing in quest of one battalion and three companies of local Viet Cong (VC) guerrillas and at least one People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) battalion, had begun on 28 April 1967. Assigned an operational area after transferring men and mail brought out from Subic Bay, Whitfield County steamed in the amphibious objective area until 10 May 1967, when she embarked 100 patients and 100 empty oxygen bottles from hospital ship for transportation to Da Nang. Reaching Da Nang on 11 May 1967, Whitfield County returned to Amphibious Ready Group \\"Alfa\\" on the morning of 13 May 1967, again landed passengers and delivered mail, refilled oxygen bottles, ice cream and other dairy products to Sanctuary. Upon the termination of Operation Beaver Cage that afternoon, the enemy having fled, Whitfield County proceeded to a holding area at sea northeast of Da Nang and rendezvoused with the other ships of the amphibious ready group that evening. On 16 May 1967, in a commanders' conference on board Okinawa, the commander of Amphibious Squadron 9 revealed the next operation, Operation Beau Charger. On the morning of 17 May 1967, the task group rendezvoused with stores ship for replenishment and, during the early evening hours, began its approach to the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The largest concentration of naval gunfire support ships since the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) softened the DMZ prior to Amphibious Ready Group Alpha's assault, which was aimed at destroying enemy forces and supplies and evacuating non-combatants. At 08:00, Operation Beau Charger commenced as destroyers quickly moved in and blasted the enemy guns. Resistance at the beach was confined to sniper fire and shells from quickly silenced North Vietnamese shore batteries. Pronounced resistance came at helicopter landing zones, but despite that, the helicopter-landed Marines linked up with tank units and initiated search and destroy operations that lasted through the next week. Whitfield County operated in support of Operation Beau Charger until 25 May 1967, conducting replenishment via landing craft and boats of supplies needed ashore with craft from USS Point Defiance. Proceeding to Da Nang on 25 May 1967, Whitfield County reached Da Nang on 26 May 1967 and, after offloading, was detached from Amphibious Ready Group Alfa. She subsequently transported a load of bombs from Da Nang to Chu Lai, loading vehicles there for transportation to Naha, before she returned to Da Nang to load equipment and embark men of Amphibious Construction Battalion 1, Detachment \\"B.\\" She departed Vietnamese waters on the morning of 3 June 1967 and reached Naha on 9 June 1967. Offloading the vehicles and backloading deadlined generators, Whitfield County arrived at Yokosuka on 14 June 1967. Whitfield County returned to Vietnamese waters in the summer of 1967 to resume her support operations for riverine activities in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam, basing again at V≈©ng T√†u. She departed Yokosuka on 28 July 1967 and reached V≈©ng T√†u, after a stop at Hong Kong, on 17 August 1967. Relieving landing ship tank of Task Force 117 support duties on 18 August 1967, Whitfield County got underway on 20 August 1967 for the confluence of the Vam Co River and Soirap River to rendezvous with the Mobile Riverine Base (MRB). From 20 August 1967 to 5 September 1967, Whitfield County provided \\"housekeeping\\" services and support for River Division III, \\"C\\" Company, 2nd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, and \\"A\\" Company, 9th Battalion. She supplied ammunition, water, and rations to the troops in the field, was the focal point of helicopter support operations, served as combat store warehouse, and provided mortuary services for the killed in action periodically brought to the ship. Toward the end of that period, on 3 September 1967, the Mobile Riverine Base shifted its base of operations from the Soirap-Vam Co area back to V≈©ng T√†u to support projected riverine strikes into the Rung Sat Special Zone. On 11 September 1967, the Mobile Riverine Base proceeded to the Mekong River entrance, escorted by various units of the Riverine Division, who provided minesweeping, close fire support, and reconnaissance when needed. Subsequently, while located in the Dong Tam Base Camp area, Whitfield County assisted search and destroy operations in the Cam Son secret zone, Dinh Tuong Province, Kien Hoa Province and in the Giong Troms district. On 28 September 1967, the Mobile Riverine Base shifted again, this time to the confluence of the Cua Tien River and the Cua Dai River, to facilitate strike operations into Kien Hoa Province. Whitfield County worked in that locale until 1 October 1967, when the Mobile Riverine Base was shifted back to Dong Tam to support projected strikes into the Western Ben Zong secret zone, Dinh Troung Province, to destroy PAVN/VC forces in that area. Whitfield County subsequently supported mobile riverine operations at V≈©ng T√†u and back at the junction of the Soirap and Vam Co Rivers into late October 1967. While in the latter locale, elements of the riverine forces provided the necessary security during the lower house elections for South Vietnam's parliament. Returning to V≈©ng T√†u on 24 October 1967, Whitfield County was relieved by landing ship tank and returned to Japan. Whitfield County underwent a period of upkeep back at Yokosuka before she returned to Vietnamese waters at the end of November 1967. She operated between Da Nang and Chu Lai through early December 1967, transporting vehicles and other cargo, before she steamed back to Yokosuka. She arrived at Yokosuka on 22 December 1967 and remained in port until late in January 1968. = 1968 = Underway on 22 January 1968 with a cargo of two pontoon causeway sections, the vehicles and men of BMU-1, and a CH-46 helicopter, with its accompanying Sea Van ‚Äî an experimental housing seeing its first operational test and evaluation aboard Whitfield County ‚Äî the ship headed for Vietnam. Touching at Naha en route, Whitfield County reached Da Nang on 31 January 1968, transferred the Sea Van to USS Vernon County, and relieved Vernon County as support landing ship tank for Amphibious Ready Group Bravo. With the relief and transfer of the Marines and equipment completed, Whitfield County took on board the men and mail to be transported to Amphibious Ready Group Bravo and got underway on 2 February 1968 Over the ensuing month and a half, Whitfield County operated with Amphibious Ready Group Bravo within various operating areas off the DMZ, occasionally returning to Da Nang for mail, fleet freight, and passengers for delivery to the other units of the ready group. Whitfield County also sailed to Subic Bay as part of the task force for upkeep between 21 February 1968 and 28 February 1968 before she returned to Vietnamese waters. Landing ship tank relieved Whitfield County as support LST at Da Nang on 14 March 1968. After a subsequent port call at Hong Kong and a quick run to Yokosuka for restricted availability, Whitfield County returned to Vietnamese waters for a resumption of operations with the Mobile Riverine Force in mid-July 1968 at Dong Tam, again relieving Vernon County. During her deployment with Task Force 117 in ensuing months, Whitfield County operated on a nearly non-stop, 24-hour-a-day basis, supporting the U.S. Army's 4th Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment), 9th Infantry Division, and three helicopters of a U.S. Army aviation detachment, as well as the boats and men of River Assault Division 92. By the time landing ship tank Westchester County relieved Whitfield County on 23 September 1968, Whitfield County had travelled over 900 nautical miles (1,667 kilometers) within the Mekong Delta, processed over 25,000 hot rations, and handled roughly 4,000 tons of cargo. Subsequently, visiting Bangkok, Thailand, for rest and recreation, Whitfield County then headed for Da Nang, where she side-loaded two causeway sections for transportation to Okinawa. She then returned to Yokosuka for repairs before again heading for Vietnam toward the end of November 1968. Touching at Subic Bay en route, she reputedly became the first landing ship tank to use water-filled causeway sections to serve as armor along the thinly-armored sides of the ship. The causeway sections were intended provide a water-filled barrier against recoilless rifle projectiles and rockets. After relieving landing ship tank at Dong Tam on 30 November 1968, Whitfield County spent the rest of 1968 as support landing ship tank for Mobile Riverine Group Alfa, Task Group 117.1, one of the two task groups that made up Mobile Riverine Flotilla 1. Other ships of Mobile Riverine Group Alfa were the barracks ships and , the landing craft repair ship and the barracks craft and . Embarked in Whitfield County were elements of the Army's 9th Infantry Division and a Cyclops aviation detachment, equipped with OH-6 Cayuse helicopters. The ship herself performed a fivefold role: (1) maintaining a round-the-clock, air- and water- mobile resupply readiness to provide field units with ammunition, rations, fresh water, and fuel; (2) serving as a mobile base for helicopter operations; (3) providing harassment and on-call gunfire support when necessary; (4) supplying boat service among the ships of the Mobile Riverine Group; and (5) providing subsistence, berthing, and services for embarked personnel. = 1969 = At 23:30 on 9 January 1969, the Mobile Riverine Group base at Dong Tam came under enemy rocket and mortar attack. Whitfield County went to general quarters and participated in counterbattery fire, hurling 16 rounds of 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) projectiles in the direction of the hostile fire. Although securing at midnight, Whitfield County manned her guns a half-hour later, at 00:30, lobbing three rounds of call fire. Whitfield County subsequently shifted from B·∫øn Tre to the Song Ham Loung anchorage and returned to Dong Tam at 11:00 on 20 January 1969 to commence turnover to Vernon County, her relief in Task Group 117.1. That night, communist forces attacked the Mobile Riverine Group and the base at Dong Tam with rockets and mortars; Whitfield County went to general quarters at 21:59 and, between 22:50 and 23:00, expended 12 rounds against the enemy artillerymen. Between 1 January 1969 and 22 January 1969, Whitfield Countys gunners loosed a total of 78 rounds of call-fire, and the ship held flight quarters for the recovery of Cayuse and UH-lB Huey helicopters 306 times, without mishap. At 23:00 on 23 January 1969, Whitfield Countys turnover to Vernon County was complete. However, there was more work for Whitfield County before she could clear the muddy Vietnamese waters. At 23:21 she headed for V≈©ng T√†u. There, she took over from landing ship tank , which had recently been damaged in a VC rocket attack while beached at the V≈©ng T√†u ramps, in supporting and resupplying Task Group 117.2, Mobile Riverine Group Bravo. Late on 24 January 1969, after loading a tank deck cargo of palletized ammunition and C rations and a main-deck load of crated supplies, spare parts, stores, and fresh provisions, Whitfield County got underway for the mouth of the Bassac River (Cua Tranh De). On the morning of 26 January 1969, Whitfield County, escorted by two river patrol boats (PBRs), transited the Bassac River without incident and over the ensuing days resupplied and provisioned the ships of Task Group 117.2, landing craft repair ship and barracks ships and . Whitfield County then returned to V≈©ng T√†u, where she was relieved as support landing ship tank for Task Group 117.2 by on 30 January 1969. At noon that day, Whitfield County headed for Hong Kong. Whitfield County spent six days at Hong Kong before she sailed for Okinawa to pick up cargo earmarked for shipment to Yokosuka. After loading vehicles and nine men from Beachmaster Unit 1, Western Pacific Detachment, at Red Beach 1, Chin Wan, Okinawa, Whitfield County proceeded on to Yokosuka, reaching that port on the morning of 17 February 1969. After upkeep at Yokosuka in late February 1969, Whitfield County acted as observer at the Republic of Korea Navy amphibious exercise Phiblex 1-69 at Chinhae, South Korea, between 28 March 1969 and 2 April 1969. During that time, she also trained South Korean naval personnel. Whitfield County subsequently returned to Yokosuka for more upkeep before she sailed, via Subic Bay, for Vietnamese waters where she loaded side-protection causeway sections. Arriving at Dong Tam on 8 May 1969, she there relieved Windham County as support landing ship tank for River Assault Flotilla 1, Task Force 117. As before, she operated alternately at Dong Tam, Song Ham Loung (B·∫øn Tre), and M·ªπ Tho. At 02:05 on 6 June 1969, while Whitfield County was at Dong Tam, four rounds of hostile fire landed between 50 and 300 yards (46 and 274 meters) from the ships of the Mobile Riverine Force. Whitfield County immediately set general quarters; and, in the next 35 minutes, her guns hurled some 140 rounds of 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) counterbattery fire at the enemy artillery. The riverine force again came under enemy fire that morning; Whitfield County again blasted the enemy positions with 170 more 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) projectiles. Whitfield County subsequently shifted to B·∫øn Tre but returned to Dong Tam by 13 June 1969. While she lay anchored there, Storekeeper 3rd Class L. E. Smith, assigned as roving sentry on the port side of the ship, spotted a swimmer in the water at 01:00 on 15 June 1969. Since VC sappers were known to have been active in that area, Storekeeper Smith promptly opened fire. Within a short time, the water around the ship was thoroughly grenaded. Later that morning, a Vietnamese body that had been shot was found floating nearby. For his prompt action, Storekeeper Smith received the recommendation for the Navy Commendation Medal for \\"effectively thwarting an attempt to mine the ship.\\" Three days later, rocket fire landed within of the ship at 14:05 on 18 June 1969. Unable to return the fire because of the presence of friendly forces in the area, Whitfield County shifted her anchorage to avoid being hit. Later that afternoon, the riverine force shifted its anchorage back to M·ªπ Tho. Whitfield County was relieved by landing ship tank USS Tom Green County on 4 July 1969. Between 8 May 1969 and 4 July 1969, Whitfield County had expended some 2,982 rounds of 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) projectiles on call-fire and counterbattery fire, conducted some 850 helicopter landings, and travelled within the Mekong Delta. She had also witnessed the gradual turnover of all River Assault Flotilla 1 assets to the Republic of Vietnam Navy, the beginning of the redeployment of the 9th Infantry Division from the Mekong Delta, and the gradual disbanding of Task Force 117. When she sailed on 5 July 1969, she left the Mekong Delta region for the last time. Returning to Yokosuka via Keelung, Taiwan, Whitfield County soon commenced a badly needed overhaul, one that lasted into the autumn of 1969. For the remainder of the 1969, she operated locally in Japanese waters. = 1970‚Äì1972 = Until 1972, Whitfield County worked out of Yokosuka, touching occasionally at Okinawa in the course of amphibious maneuvers and exercises and at Subic Bay in the Philippines. She served three tours with Amphibious Ready Group Bravo in 1970. During 1971, Whitfield County served two tours as support landing ship tank for Operation Market Time interdiction operations out of V≈©ng T√†u. A highlight of her 1971 operations were her support activities for stores ship Regulus, which had been forced aground on the rocks in the western harbor of Hong Kong when Typhoon Rose struck China on 16 August 1971; Whitfield County provided berthing and messing facilities for Reguluss crew. Whitfield County served one tour with Amphibious Ready Group Alfa and one with Operation Market Time forces in 1972.  Decommissioning and Greek service  Whitfield County arrived at Yokosuka on 23 December 1972 after exercising with U.S. Marine Corps units at Okinawa. She remained there until she was decommissioned on 15 March 1973. She was stricken from the Navy List on 15 August 1976. Whitfield County was sold to Greece on 1 March 1977 under the Security Assistance Program. Commissioned into the Hellenic Navy, she was renamed Kos (L116). Kos had a long career, not being decommissioned until 1 June 2000. Kos was sunk as a target on 24 June 2004 during the Hellenic Navy exercise Thiela III by Penguin missiles fired by the Greek fast attack craft missile (FACMs) and and torpedoes from the Greek torpedo boats and .

History They were first built in 1893 by the firm of Stettiner Maschinenbau AG Vulcan, but later by the other larger Prussian locomotive manufacturers as well. The boiler was the same as that of the G 5.1. The locomotives were intended for heavy goods duties especially on hilly routes. As a result, most of the engines went to the western German and Silesian railway divisions. By 1909, 1,002 examples had been delivered to the Prussian state railways. During the First World War simple and robust locomotives were required for military use. As a result, in 1916/1917 a further 200 G 7.1s were built. From 1916, the k.u.k. Heeresbahn in Austria had 35 units of the Class G 7.1 which it named the Class 274. They were intended for use on the broad gauge Russian Railways. The L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway also bought three G 7.1s, which had been manufactured in 1898 by Schwartzkopff. Another seven engines went to the Gutehoffnungsh√ºtte. Even the Palatinate Railway placed 27 of its G 4' in service; the design of these was based on the Prussian G 7.1. In 1923 the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over no less than 680 from the Prussian state railways into its renumbering plan; in 1925 they listed locomotive numbers 55 001‚Äì660. In 1935 13 more came from the Saar railways and one from France into the Reichsbahn fleet as 55 661-673 and 55 674. The three G 7.1s with the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway were given numbers 55 681‚Äì683 in 1938. In the Second World War 105 G 7.1s were taken over from Poland into the Reichsbahn's inventory. They were given the numbers of engines already retired. In addition, G 7.1 engines from Lithuania were added as numbers 55 274 and 55 691-694. After the Second World War, the locomotives that ended up in the Deutsche Bundesbahn were mainly used in shunting duties and were retired by 1957. In the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany the last G 7.1 was not retired until 1966, including number 55 642. Preserved locomotives Locomotive 55 669 was retired in 1964 and has been displayed since in the Dresden Transport Museum in Dresden. Photograph of the 55 669 Locomotives 55 196, 393, 400, 493 and 553 were left in Austrian territory after the Second World War. Apart from 55 553, which had been taken over by 1950, the √ñBB incorporated them into their √ñBB Class 655, retaining their serial numbers. The last one, 655.393, was withdrawn in 1957. Its task had been shunting at Stadlau station. The vehicles were equipped with tenders of classes pr 3 T 12 and pr 3 T 16.5 (built 1916/17).

They are the opposite of nidifugous species, which leave their parents more quickly and survive independently. Two other terms are also used by scientists for related developmental phenomena: altricial (relatively undeveloped at birth or hatching; helpless, blind, without feathers or hair, and unable to fend for themselves) and precocial (relatively developed at birth or hatching; able to fend for themselves).Ehrlich, P.

New York: Simon & Schuster, p. 582 Although there is much overlap between altricial and nidicolous species, the terms are not identical. All altricial animals are nidicolous by necessity, but an animal may be nidicolous, such as staying at the nest, even if it is precocial and fully capable of leaving if needed. Examples of precocious but nidicolous species include many gulls and terns. Examples of nidicolous species are most mammals and many species of birds. The majority of nidicolous animals are altricial. During the life span, the brain of a nidicolous animal expands 8‚Äì10 times its initial size; in nidifugous animals, from 1.5 to 2.5 times.Grene, M.

He notably played in the Football League for Grimsby Town, where he was on loan from Tranmere Rovers. He left Rovers in 2004 having failed to make an appearance and went on to feature for Vauxhall Motors, York City, Bedlington Terriers, Newcastle Blue Star and Whitley Bay. Career Robinson was associated with his home-town club Newcastle United as a schoolboy, then moved to Tranmere Rovers as a 16-year-old. He turned professional in 2002, spent time on loan to Vauxhall Motors of the Northern Premier League, and scored well in youth and reserve team football, but in August 2003 was allowed to join Football League Two club York City on a two-game trial with a view to a possible loan or permanent move. An ankle injury cut short the trial and the player returned to Prenton Park. In September 2004, Grimsby Town manager Russell Slade signed Robinson on a one-month loan. Slade also signed Jon Daly and Chris Williams from Stockport County. As all three players were forwards, this meant the club had six forwards under contract. Robinson got his chance at Blundell Park; he made his full professional debut on 11 September 2004, playing the whole of a 3‚Äì1 defeat against Macclesfield Town. He played twice more for the Mariners, each time finishing on the losing side, and then returned to Tranmere. Unable to hold down a place in Tranmere's reserves, Robinson returned to York City, by then a Conference club, on trial in November 2004. While the trial continued, Tranmere released the player, who then signed a short-term contract with York City. York City's squad already contained the former Newcastle United striker Paul Robinson, who was listed as Paul D Robinson to avoid confusion. Robinson was released at the end of the season and returned to his native north-east of England, where he joined Bedlington Terriers of the Northern League, the club for which his brother Michael was playing. In the 2006 close season he signed for Northern League champions Newcastle Blue Star, and a year later moved on to Whitley Bay of Northern League Division One. In 2009, he was part of the team that beat Glossop North End in the final of the FA Vase at Wembley, having lost at the semi-final stage the previous year. Robinson returned to Wembley the following season having scored a dramatic last minute winning goal in the semi-final against Barwell, and scored the 5th goal in a 6‚Äì1 rout of Wroxham. Robinson ended the season winning the BBC Radio Newcastle player of the year award,and also added Goal of the Season, Fans player of the Season, Players player of the Season and Player of the year at the annual Whitley Bay presentation evening, to his ever-growing list of individual trophies, this as well as finishing runner up in the Northern League Player of the year awards. In 2012 it was announced that Robinson would captain the side in 2012‚Äì2013 season. He joined Darlington 1883 in May 2013, and Blyth Spartans in November 2013. Robinson has since gone on to have two spells with Blyth Spartans sandwiching a second spell with Whitley before moving on to Morpeth Town and North Shields.https://www.northshieldsfc.co.uk/single-post/2017/07/01/Paul-Robinson ---Career-so-far References External links * (up to 2003‚Äì04 season) * (2004‚Äì05 season) Category:Living people Category:1984 births Category:Sportspeople from Newcastle upon Tyne Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players Category:Vauxhall Motors F.C. players Category:Grimsby Town F.C. players Category:York City F.C. players Category:Bedlington Terriers F.C. players Category:Newcastle Blue Star F.C. players Category:Whitley Bay F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Blyth Spartans A.F.C. players ","title":"Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1984)"},{"id":"20116489","text":"And They Call It Democracy is a radio program which ran from June 2005 to November 2008 on KPOV-LP in Bend, Oregon, United States.

This is based on [http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com This time is different: Eight centuries of financial folly], which covers only 70 countries. The general upward trend might be attributed to many factors. One of these is a gradual historical increase in the percent of people who receive money for their labor. Another, elsewhere suggested reason related to more recent development trends and to banking crisis during modern era might be changes in the size of banking sector compared to overall GDP. The dramatic feature of this graph is the virtual absence of banking crises during the period of the Bretton Woods agreement, 1945 to 1971.

A banking crisis is a financial crisis that affects banking activity. Banking crises include bank runs, which affect single banks; banking panics, which affect many banks; and systemic banking crises, in which a country experiences many defaults and financial institutions and corporations face great difficulties repaying contracts. A banking crisis is marked by bank runs that lead to the demise of financial institutions, or by the demise of a financial institution that starts a string of similar demises.  Bank runs  A bank run occurs when many bank customers withdraw their deposits because they believe the bank might fail. There have been many runs on individual banks throughout history; for example, some of the 2008‚Äì2009 bank failures in the United States were associated with bank runs.

He is perhaps best known for his involvement in an incident during a 1959 game where two baseballs were in play at the same time. Career From 1935 to 1942, Delmore pitched in the minor leagues, most notably with the Hopkinsville Hoppers in 1937.Joshua R. Maxwell and Kevin D. McCann, The Kitty League (Arcadia Publishing 2012): p. 38. His professional umpiring career began in 1948 in the KITTY League. He worked in the Southern Association from 1949 to 1955. Following his promotion to the National League in 1956, he worked a total of 618 games through the 1959 season. During those four seasons, he issued 14 ejections, including Cincinnati Reds manager Birdie Tebbetts three times. =Incident= Delmore was involved in one of the most bizarre plays in baseball history, which happened during a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on June 30, 1959. With the Cardinals leading 2‚Äì1 in the top of the 4th inning, Stan Musial came to bat with one out and no one on base. On a count of 3-1, Cubs' pitcher Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Delmore called ball four, but Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, third baseman Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back. Meanwhile, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Sammy Taylor. Anderson, noticing that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball and threw it towards second baseman Tony Taylor, but the throw was high and went into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw (the original ball) and only noticed Anderson's throw (the new ball) fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks. After a delay and arguments from the managers, Musial was eventually ruled out.Musial Is First in History Put Out By 2 Baseballs! The Cardinals filed a protest, which became moot when they won the game 4‚Äì1, and thus the play stood. This was the first known occurrence in Major League Baseball history in which two balls were in play simultaneously.Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo, \\"Vic Delmore's Mental Lapse,\\" Baseball Hall of Shame (Simon and Schuster 1989): p. 46. =Aftermath= Delmore's umpiring contract was not renewed for the 1960 season by the National League, despite a \\"deluge\\" of telegrams from fans who considered his termination unjust.\\"Fans Protest Delmore Firing By Giles,\\" Milwaukee Sentinel (January 4, 1960): p. 7.\\"Barrage of Letters Follows Giles' Firing of Delmore,\\" Reading Eagle (January 4, 1960): p. 17.

It was also recognised as the 24th tropical depression and the 22nd tropical storm by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season. Meteorological history On November 5, 2008, a tropical disturbance formed in the Philippine Sea to the northeast of Zamboanga in the Philippines. Later that day whilst the disturbance moved towards the north-west, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the disturbances chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \\"Poor\\". Early the next day as the disturbance was moving closer to the Philippines, PAGASA designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression Quinta. Later that day the JTWC upgraded the disturbances chances of becoming a significant tropical cyclone to \\"Fair\\" and then to \\"Good\\" as they released a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing disturbance. The Japan Meteorological Agency then designated the disturbance as a minor tropical depression, at the same time the JTWC designated the tropical depression as 24W. On November 7 after the JMA had designated the minor tropical depression as a full tropical depression, the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm with the JMA assigning the name Maysak. The next day PAGASA released their final advisory on tropical storm Quinta (Maysak) as it had moved out of PAGASA's area of responsibility, this came as both the JTWC and the JMA reported that Maysak had reached its peak wind speeds of 60 mph (95 km/h) 10-Min sustained & 70 mph (110 km/h) 1-Min sustained. This meant that the JMA considered Maysak to be a severe tropical storm at its peak whilst on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale Maysak was considered to be a tropical storm. Later that day Maysak recurved and started moving towards the south towards PAGASA's area of responsibility. The next day before Maysak re-entered PAGASA's area of responsibility, the JMA reported that Maysak had weakened into a tropical storm and then into a tropical depression, and released their final full advisory on Maysak. However the JTWC were reporting at this time that Maysak was still a tropical storm. Maysak then moved back into PAGASA's area of responsibility later that day, at this time PAGASA thought that Maysak was still a tropical storm. The JTWC downgraded Maysak to a tropical depression and released their final advisory early on November 10. PAGASA also downgraded Maysak to a tropical depression at this time however they kept issuing warnings until early the next afternoon when they released their final advisory on Quinta. On November 12, PAGASA started to reissue advisories on Quinta, however they renamed Quinta as Siony. The JMA were also still monitoring Siony as a minor tropical depression at this time, whilst the JTWC assessed Maysak's remnants chances of regenerating into a significant tropical cyclone as fair. Later that day the JTWC upgraded the remnants chances of regenerating as good and released a tropical cyclone formation alert. Later that day PAGASA released their final advisory on tropical depression Siony as it had moved out of their area of responsibility and was moving towards Vietnam in the west. Late the next day the JTWC cancelled the tropical cyclone formation alert as they had reassessed Maysak chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as poor. Early the next day the JMA released their final advisory on tropical depression Maysak whilst later that morning the JTWC declared that Maysak had dissipated. Preparations and Impact =Philippines= As PAGASA declared that Tropical Depression Quinta had formed, they put Public Storm warning signal No.1 up for parts of Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao. This meant that wind speeds of 30‚Äì60 km/h were expected within 36 hours. Later that day PAGASA put some more areas of Luzon under Signal 1 and cancelled the signal over parts of Mindanao Later on November 6 PAGASA kept revising the areas under Signal No.1 in Visayas & Luzon. PAGASA then cancelled all signals for Visayas Later that day as Quinta moved away from the Philippines. Early the next day PAGASA cancelled all off the signals for Luzon as they released their first final advisory on Qunita. On November 12, the Philippine National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) reported that over 4800 people were affected by tropical storm Maysak. The NDCC reported that a total of 92 homes were either partially or totally destroyed in the Philippines. Sixteen of the municipalities in the Philippines reported power interruptions from November 6 until November 7. In total 19 people were killed by Maysak and 14 people injured. =Vietnam= The remnants of Maysak lead to flooding rains in Vietnam which left at least 11 people dead. Flood waters in Ho Chi Minh City were estimated to be at least a metre (3 ft) deep.

Forty were built between 1899 and 1902. They were known as \\"High-Flyers\\" as a result of having a high-pitched boiler that was supposed to increase stability at speed. All passed into London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) ownership on the grouping of 1923, becoming the LMS's only atlantic tender engine class. The LMS gave them the power classification 2P. Withdrawals started in 1926, and the last was withdrawn in 1934. None was preserved. Numbering The locomotives were built in two batches of 20 at Horwich Works. The first batch, turned out in 1899, were numbered 1400, 1392‚Äì9, 1401‚Äì4, 700, 702, 708, 711, 718, 735, 737; the second batch of 1902 were numbered 1405‚Äì24. Those numbered in the 700s took the numbers of older locomotives which had been withdrawn; the others were given numbers at the end of the L&YR; list which were as yet unused. Under the LMS, they were allocated the numbers 10300‚Äì39 in order of construction, but several were withdrawn before these numbers could be applied. Details No. 737, the last locomotive of the first batch, is believed by John Marshall to have been the first British superheated locomotive. The front tubeplate of the boiler was recessed, creating a cylindrical space into which the superheater was mounted. This consisted of a drum long through which were a number of tubes for the hot gases to pass through. It offered only a low degree of superheat ‚Äì above the normal steam temperature. The last five locomotives of the 1902 batch, nos. 1420‚Äì4, were given the same apparatus when new, but it was removed from all six by 1917.

The Bolshoy Dom building is part of a larger complex which includes the detention facility on Shpalernaya Street, with both gaining notoriety as a prison during the Great Purge under Joseph Stalin. In July 1934, the building became local headquarters of the newly-created People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), when the OGPU was reincorporated as the Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB) of the NKVD. Bolshoy Dom subsequently became the local headquarters for the more widely known Committee for State Security (KGB) when it replaced the NKVD, and remained under KGB usage until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Bolshoy Dom became the subject of numerous urban legends in Soviet and Russian culture due to its association with the secret police, including all buildings of the FSB being nicknamed Bolshoy Dom. The common conspiracy theory about the building is that it contains a large amount of secret underground floors, leading to jokes about Bolshoy Dom being the tallest building in Saint Petersburg. There is also a legend that the building survived the Siege of Leningrad during World War II because Nazi Germany was aware that German prisoners of war were housed in the top floor, preventing it from being bombed.

The roof is surmounted by two large chimneys and a central belvedere. This belvedere reflects the roof shape which surrounds it and completes the total pyramidal massing with an elaborate finial. The entire exterior wall surface above the brick basement is covered by wooden drop siding cut to resemble ashlar stonework. The deep, overhanging eaves are emphasized by the placing of oversized paired brackets, with their undulating curves and pendants, around the entire roofline. The three-bay main facade (north) features a central entrance porch with an elliptical-arched fanlight and sidelights framing the double doors. On the second level, twin-arched windows which open to the balustraded porch roof visually support the circular window above, set in the cross-gable. At either side of the central porch and window bay on the first level are also twin-arched windows with hood molds and shallow balconies. On the second level of the two end bays are three-sectioned windows in the Palladian motif. The east and west facades are similar, both being four bays wide and having arched windows. On the east front, however, a five-sectioned oriel bay was placed on the first story which is partially blocked by a frame wing added circa 1912. The rear (south) facade has been partially obscured by shallow wings and a sleeping porch. On the interior, the broad central hall is divided at midpoint by a graceful elliptical arch which rests at either side on piers alluding to the Doric order in detail. The stair which ascends along the east wall of the hall and curves at the beginning and end of each flight, develops exceptional rhythm of design due to the repetition of the octagonal- shaped and turned balusters, two to a tread. In addition, the scrolled, uncarved brackets on the step ends and the fascia board on the landings increase the activity of the design, making the stairway the finest single piece of woodwork in the house. Two rooms flank the hall on both sides and offer a calm contrast to the stair by featuring broad, flat window and door framings as well as black marble mantels with arched openings and subtle curving lines in the shelf. The southeast room has been partitioned into several smaller rooms, including a kitchen. Although most doors have a pair of small rectangular panels below the lock rail with two tall ones above, variations occur with the lower panels being octagonal while the upper panels have arched tops. An old structure to the rear appears to date from the first quarter of the nineteenth century due to some remaining architrave door framings and doors, the brick noggin walls, and the 6'-10\\" wide fireplaces on both ends of the two-story, hipped roof building. This house is believed to be the original Howard dwelling.Staff, Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission (August 22, 1969). \\"National Register of Historic Places Nomination: Mayhurst / Howard Place\\".

Based on a story co-written by Bava, Romano Migliorini, and Roberto Natale, the film focuses on a small village in the early 1900s that is being terrorized by the ghost of a murderous young girl. Shot in Calcata in 1965, Kill, Baby, Kill had a troubled production. F.U.L. Films ran out of money during principal photography, the film was shot without a complete script, and the score had to be compiled from stock music created for earlier film productions. During its domestic theatrical release in Italy, the film grossed 201 million Italian lira. With the re-evaluation of Bava's filmography, Kill, Baby, Kill has been acclaimed by filmmakers and critics as one of the director's finest works, and was placed at number 56 on a Time Out poll of the best horror films.  Plot  In 1907, Dr. Paul Eswai is sent to the Carpathian village of Karmingam to perform an autopsy on Irena Hollander, a woman who died under mysterious circumstances in an abandoned church. Monica Schufftan, a medical student who has recently returned to visit her parents' graves, is assigned as his witness. Upon performing the autopsy, they finds a silver coin embedded in Hollander's heart. The local villagers are accustomed to medicinal practices and superstitions Eswai finds preposterous, and claim that Karmingam is haunted by the ghost of a young girl who curses those she visits. After Nadienne, the daughter of local innkeepers, is visited by the girl, a ritual to reverse the curse is performed by Ruth, the village witch. That evening, Eswai goes to meet with a colleague, Inspector Kruger, at the villa of Baroness Graps. When he arrives at the large, decrepit house, the Baroness informs him that she knows of no such Kruger. Upon leaving, Eswai encounters the ghostly young girl. Meanwhile, Monica has a nightmare about the child, and awakens to find a doll at the foot of her bed. She runs into Eswai in the street, and he offers to take her to the inn so she can sleep. At the inn, Eswai discovers that Nadienne is wearing a leech vine around her body as part of Ruth's treatment. Believing this procedure to be causing her greater suffering, he removes the vine despite her family's concerns. In the local cemetery, Eswai finds two gravediggers burying Kruger's corpse, who has been shot in the head. Simultaneously, Nadienne is awoken by the young girl at her window, who compels her to impale herself with a candelabra. Eswai and Monica are informed by Karl, the burgomeister, that the ghostly girl is Melissa Graps, the dead daughter of the Baroness, and that she is responsible for the deaths of Hollander and Kruger; he also reveals to Monica that the Schufftans were not her real parents. When he goes to retrieve evidence proving so, he is compelled by Melissa into destroying the documents and killing himself. Turned away by Nadinne's father due to her death, Monica and Eswai attempt to get the reluctant villagers' attention by ringing the church bell. Inside the church, they find a secret passageway, where Monica experiences d√©j√† vu. They discover the Graps' family tomb, which includes that of Melissa, who died in 1887, aged seven. They find a staircase leading out of the tomb, which takes them inside the Villa Graps, where the Baroness confronts them in the hallway. She reveals that Melissa was trampled to death while fetching a ball during a drunken festival. Melissa appears in the room, and Monica suddenly vanishes through a doorway. Eswai chases after her through a series of doorways before finding himself locked in a room, and is subsequently spirited out of the villa. He loses consciousness, and awakens in Ruth's home. Ruth explains that the coins found in the hearts of the victims have been placed there by her as talismans to ward off supernatural powers of the Baroness, who has invoked her daughter's ghost to punish the villagers, and that she intends to kill the Baroness to avenge Karl, who was her lover. In the villa, the Baroness reveals to Monica that she is her daughter, and Melissa her older sister; following Melissa's death, the Baroness' servants, the Schufftans, sent Monica to be raised and educated in Gr√§fenberg for her protection. Melissa's ghost appears, chases Monica down the staircase into the tomb, and urges her to throw herself from a nearby balcony. Ruth arrives and confronts the Baroness. The Baroness stabs her through the chest with a fire poker, but Ruth manages to strangle her to death before dying, thus laying Melissa's soul to rest; Eswai arrives in time to save Monica. Reunited, the pair leave Villa Graps as the sun rises in the distance.

The film was funded by the small Italian company F.U.L. Film. Mario Bava biographer Tim Lucas has estimated that the budget for the film was lower than those of his films that were distributed by American International Pictures in the United States, estimating it as well below $50,000. Actress Erika Blanc was cast as Monica Schuftan in the film, and claimed the film was only her second feature she made, despite filmographies suggesting otherwise. Bava auditioned hundreds of young girls to play the part of Melissa Graps, but was unable to find one. Bava eventually cast the son of his concierge, Valerio Valeri. Blanc stated Valeri was not happy with the role, specifically wearing the dress and that Bava would goad his performance by referring to him as Valeria. =Filming= Lucas described the production of Kill, Baby, Kill as being plagued by \\"bad luck\\" as the film ran out of money while filming. Blanc stated that the cast and crew were only paid for their first two weeks working on the film, and agreed to complete it without pay due to their affection for Bava. Bava's friend Luigi Cozzi stated that Bava was never paid for his work on the film. According to Bava, the film was shot in 12 days in 1965. The exterior scenes were filmed on location in the medieval town of Calcata, while interiors were shot at Titanus Appia Studios, where it was one of the last films shot before it predominantly became a distribution company. Kill, Baby, Kills story is officially credited to Romano Migliorini and Roberto Natale with a screenplay credited to Migliorini, Natale and Mario Bava. Migliorini and Roberto Natale were a screenwriting team, who had previously collaborated on the horror film Terror- Creatures from the Grave. Bava stated in an interview that the film was improvised on the spot from a script of only 30 pages. Lucas has suggested the screenplay for the film may have been based on an early screenplay for La vendetta di Lady Morgan by Natale and Migliorini. Film historian Roberto Curti refuted this, noting that Kill Baby Kill's shooting script titled Le macabre ore della paura () featured detailed dialogue and a completed storyline. The screenplay stored in Rome's Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia was deposited there on April 5, 1966, as screenplays are generally deposited there before shooting has started. Curti noted that La vendetta di Lady Morgan began shooting on 26 July 1965 and was submitted to the Ministerial Censorship Commission on October 1 and was released on December 16. This screenplay also revealed that ideas had already been used in Bava's previous films that had been discarded, such as victims returning from the dead as zombies. The film's screenplay also includes scenes that remain in the film, such as the scene of the spiral staircase and the scene where Dr. Eswai chases his doppelganger over and over into the same room. The special effects, such as the distorted vision at the beginning of the film, were created using a piece of distorted glass, a technique developed by Bava's father Eugenio Bava when he was a silent film camera operator. Other budgetary concerns led to Bava shooting the film without a crane, leading him to film with a makeshift seesaw to shoot certain scenes. The film's score is credited to Carlo Rustichelli, but is actually a collection of library music, featuring works by Rustichelli and other composers who had worked with Bava. Lucas suggested that the use of stock music, as opposed to an original score, was due to the low budget of the production. Other music includes Francesco De Masi music from The Murder Clinic, the lullaby piece of music heard in the films titles was composed by Armando Trovajoli originally used in the comedy film What Ever Happened to Baby Toto?. Music from previous films includes pieces composed by Rustichelli for The Long Hair of Death, Blood and Black Lace, The Whip and the Body and Roman Vlad's music from I Vampiri. Release Kill, Baby, Kill was released in Italy on July 8, 1966 and was distributed by I.N.D.I.E.F. By the time the film was released, Blanc was known for appearing in various spy films. One film, titled Agente S 03: Operazione Atlantide led to Kill, Baby, Kill being released as Operation paura in Italy. The film was released during the height of the Italian vacation season. It was shown in Rome for only four days and then vanished from circulation. It grossed a total of 201 million Italian lira domestically on its initial theatrical release, a figure described by Roberto Curti as \\"nondescript\\". Bava chose not to direct another horror film until 1968, when he shot Hatchet for the Honeymoon. It was released on October 8, 1967 in the United States, where it was distributed by Europix Consolidated Corporation. In the United Kingdom, it was titled Curse of the Dead and released by Marigold Films in 1967. It was re-issued in 1971 with one reel removed from it in the United States as Curse of the Living Dead. =Home media= Kill, Baby, Kill was released on DVD in September 2000 by VCI. In 2007, the home video company Dark Sky Films attempted to release Kill, Baby, Kill on DVD in North America. After assuming the rights had been secured, the company proceeded to purchase the licensing rights to the film for the United States. Dark Sky Films was then sued by Alfredo Leone, who stated that he owned the rights to the film and had recently sold the rights to the company Anchor Bay Entertainment. The courts sided with Leone and Anchor Bay, while Dark Sky Films who had already pressed DVDs of the film had to cancel the release. The film was then released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in one of two five-film boxed sets of Bava's horror films, alongside Black Sunday (1960), Black Sabbath (1963), The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963), and Knives of the Avenger (1966). The film was released on Blu-ray and special-edition DVD for the first time in North America on October 10, 2017 by Kino Lorber.  Critical reception  From contemporary reviews, Tim Mulne of the Monthly Film Bulletin noted that though \\"narrative has never been Bava's strong point, but with Operazione Paura he has happily found a story in which atmosphere is everything, and the result is even more splendid visually that Sei Donne per l'Assasino\\" The review also compared the film to that of Beauty and the Beast and The Turn of the Screw and the work of Georges Franju. \\"Byro.\\" of Variety commented that \\"every element of light and color has been carefully orchestrated by Bava to achieve a tantalizing and dramatic effect\\" and \\"plot details are juggled expertly to achieve needed scare effects\\" while \\"there's no attempt to the especial original here - it's just the same old Gothic elements, but handled so skillfully as to revitalize the genre.\\" The review concluded that \\"perhaps his pix will remain in the province of buffs, but Bava - whose sole international success was with Black Sabbath - deserves a small but firm niche in film history.\\" According to actress Erika Blanc, when the film opened in Rome it received a standing ovation from director Luchino Visconti. From retrospective reviews, Slant Magazine called it \\"arguably Bava's greatest achievement\\", giving it four stars out of a possible four. Slant also ranked it number 55 on their list of the top 100 horror films of all time. Bava biographer Tim Lucas described the film as a \\"mixture of pure poetry and pulp thriller, distinguished by vivid, hallucinogenic cinematography...jolts into the realms of free-form delirium and dementia. The spectre of little Melissa Graps, with her white lace dress and bouncing white ball, is perhaps the most influential icon of Italian horror cinema, having been copied in countless other films, notably Federico Fellini...and the film itself has been an admitted influence on such directors as Martin Scorsese and David Lynch.\\" In the 2010s, Time Out polled authors, directors, actors and critics who had worked in the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Kill, Baby, Kill at number 56 on the top 100. Taste of Cinema observed that \\"Martin Scorsese called this Bava's best film...probably the most successful realization of Gothic horror-meets-bad-acid-trip.\\" Scott Beggs said \\"This might be Bava‚Äôs greatest achievement, and he doesn‚Äôt hold out on the lush production design or the trippy camera tricks.\\" Derek Hill designated Kill, Baby, Kill! as \\"one of his best efforts and what is arguably one of the most effective and chilling supernatural gothic horror films of all time. It has influenced Federico Fellini...Martin Scorsese...Kill, Baby, Kill! creates such a palpable mood of dread and oppression in its first few minutes and so effectively sustains the momentum until the last frame that it is easy to see why it has cast such a quiet legacy on other filmmakers.\\" Patrick Legare of AllMovie called the film \\"an eerie and atmospheric effort that reflects many of the elements that have made the popular Italian director's films so compelling: excellent cinematography and strong performances from the talented cast.\\" Pablo Kjolseth of Turner Classic Movies praised the film's visuals, writing: \\"If you value mood and atmosphere over modern visceral thrills there's a good chance you'll land in the latter camp. Rich color schemes, crumbling elegant buildings, mist-covered cobble-stoned streets, dusty taverns, swirling spiral stairs, and endless halls with creepy d√©cor and art all help establish a handful of the exteriors and interiors that make the film magical.\\" Influence and analysis Kill, Baby, Kill has been credited as an inspiration on numerous filmmakers, specifically the image of the young girl with a bouncing ball utilized as a symbol of wickedness, which has been referenced in several contemporary horror films. Federico Fellini was inspired by the image, and used it in his segment \\"Toby Dammit,\\" from the anthology film Spirits of the Dead (1968). The motif of the young girl with the bouncing ball was also utilized extensively in the 2002 horror film FeardotCom. Visually, the film has been noted as an inspiration on Dario Argento's Suspiria (1977). The film's use of color has also been noted as an inspiration on the visuals of Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). Scholar David Sanjek also noted the film's use of the child symbolizing evil as a pioneering motif in the genre: \\"[Kill, Baby, Kill], a film of genuine poetic power and visual ingenuity, successfully inverted gothic stereotypes of good and evil by having the power of good embodied by a dark-haired witch while evil is represented by an angelic, blonde young girl.\\" Footnotes =References=    * Further reading * *  External links   Category:1966 films Category:Italian films Category:Italian horror films Category:Italian-language films Category:Fiction set in 1907 Category:1966 horror films Category:1960s mystery films Category:Gothic horror films Category:Films directed by Mario Bava Category:Films set in 1907 Category:Films shot in Italy Category:Italian serial killer films Category:Italian supernatural horror films Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films set in Europe Category:Period horror films ","title":"Kill, Baby, Kill"},{"id":"20116822","text":"Kjer may refer to: In people: * Eva Kjer Hansen (born 1964), the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries * Bodil Kjer (1917‚Äì2003), a Danish actress * Paul Kjer, Danish ophthalmologist who first described the condition now known as Kjer's optic neuropathy In other uses: * Kjer's optic neuropathy, dominant optic atrophy ","title":"Kjer"},{"id":"20116828","text":"Apple Writer is a word processor for the Apple II family of personal computers.

History = Apple Writer 1.0= Paul Lutus wrote Apple Writer alone in a small cottage he built himself atop a hill in the woods of Oregon, connected to the electricity grid via of cable strung in trees.http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/cottage_computer_programming.php The original 1979 version of Apple Writer ran from a 13-sector DOS 3.2 diskette and supported 40-column text display. It displayed text entirely in uppercase, but case could be toggled by pressing the ESC key; characters that the user signified as uppercase appeared in inverse (black-on-white) capitals, while characters in lowercase appeared as standard capitals. The names of the binary files Apple Writer 1.0 produced began with the prefix \\"TEXT\\". An undocumented feature was its ability to print to printers using a game paddle port as a serial interface. Users had to build their own serial cables; the risk of damage to the computer or printer was why Apple did not publicize the information, but Lutus documented the feature in a letter to BYTE. =Apple Writer 1.1= Released in 1980, Apple Writer 1.1 took advantage of DOS 3.3 and ran under the newer 16-sector format. It also featured a spell checker known as Goodspell and some minor bug fixes. =Apple Writer II= Apple Writer II was released in 1981 and, like its predecessor, ran under DOS 3.3 on an Apple II Plus. Unlike the original, Apple Writer II could display both upper and lower case characters and, with a Sup'R'Terminal card in slot 3, could support both 40- and 80-column text. It also wrapped text too long to appear on the current line (rather than breaking it mid-word) and included a glossary and the Word Processing Language (WPL), a macro-like resource that allowed certain tasks to be automated. Apple Writer II files saved as standard text files rather than the older binary files. =Apple Writer ///= This program was released in 1982 for the Apple ///, and was able to use the enhanced capabilities of the Apple ///. =Apple Writer IIe= Released in 1983, Apple Writer IIe took advantage of the Apple IIe's built-in 80-column display and full keyboard and featured the ability to create larger files, print files to disk and directly connect the computer keyboard to a printer for typewriter- like operation. =Apple Writer 2.0= Apple Writer 2.0 was released in September 1984 and was the first version of the series to run under ProDOS. It allowed users to set screen margins and to connect the computer's keyboard to a modem, allowing it to be used as a rudimentary terminal program. =Apple Writer 2.1= Published in late 1985, this version corrected a problem with parallel printer cards present in 2.0 and changed printed characters from low- ASCII to high-ASCII, correcting an issue with certain interface cards and printers. =Freeware= Following the success of AppleWorks, Apple discontinued the Apple Writer series. Creator Paul Lutus agreed in 1992 to make his program available on a freeware basis: it could be copied freely and given away, but could not be sold for a profit. Interface Apple Writer used inline commands, so formatting did not appear on-screen; it would appear when the document was printed. Paragraph formatting was specified with dot- commands, each of which required its own line. For example: .ff form feed (new page) .lmXX set left margin to XX characters .rmYY set right margin to YY characters .cj center justification .fj full justification Character formatting was specified with escape-commands, which varied depending on the printer. Common commands included Esc-X to begin underlining, and Esc-Y to end underlining. Reception Compute!s reviewer wrote in 1980 \\"I have looked at other text editors for the Apple, some of which were overloaded with features. Given the hardware limitations of the Apple II, I feel that Apple Writer is a very useful document creation tool\\", and stated that he wrote the review with Apple Writer.

She's convinced that if only she had \\"creamy thighs and amazing cheekbones that look like I'm always sipping through a straw\\" her best friend Monica wouldn't have stolen the boy she had a crush on. When Judi meets glamorous, thin as a stick (tiny as) Nancy Pratt, she thinks her life will turn around and she'll be gorgeous. Nancy teaches Judi the secret she uses to staying thin, binge-purge thinking this will somehow help. Judi is thrilled she can \\"have her cake and eat it, too and she won't gain weight.\\" But then, something dreadful happens to Nancy Pratt because of her eating disorder and she ends up in intensive care. Judi really doesn't want the same thing to happen to her but she just can't control her disorder and the worst part is, she can't or doesn't want to tell anyone, not even her own mother. This is no easy thing to cure and it's no joke for Nancy or Judi, it's a matter of Life or Death.  Reception  Fat Chance was awarded the Parents' Choice Silver Medal in 1994.

College career Began his college career at Orange Coast College, where he lettered as a kicker and backup quarterback for two seasons. Averaged 38 yards per punt as a freshman (1999) and over 40 yards per kick as a sophomore (2000).

Professional career =Minnesota Vikings (2003-2004)= He was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings 180th overall in the 2003 NFL Draft. Johnson showed a lot of promise after showing exceptional leg strength and posting good results throughout mini- camp, training camp, and the pre-season. Once the regular season began, however, Johnson's play became very inconsistent and erratic as he struggled getting the ball away like he had in college. After 14 games, he was benched in favor of veteran Leo Araguz. After an inconsistent rookie season, Johnson was put into a competition for the punting job against veteran Darren Bennett the following off-season. He was noted for developing a funky hitch in his step during mini-camp, something neither he nor his coaches knows how he developed the bad habit. Though he posted good numbers, Johnson lost the battle and was subsequently released July 23, days before training camp started. =Cincinnati Bengals (2004)= He was claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Bengals on July 26, but suffered an undisclosed injury a week into training camp and was waived August 23. He then had a tryout with the Kansas City Chiefs on August 30, but did not impress the coaches and wasn't signed. =New York Giants (2005)= Was signed by the New York Giants on January 21. He was then allocated to NFL Europa for the 2005 season. Johnson was released March 23 from the Giants. =Jacksonville Jaguars (2005)= Johnson was signed to a 1-year deal by the Jacksonville Jaguars on July 17 and competed for the job against Chris Hanson. He was released August 30. =Washington Redskins (2006)= On August 29, Johnson signed a contract with the Washington Redskins. He was suddenly released from the team later that same day after one practice. =Denver Broncos (2007)= He signed a contract with the Denver Broncos on January 2. After Todd Sauerbrun signed a contract to rejoin the team, Johnson was waived. =Detroit Lions (2008)= The Detroit Lions signed Johnson to a contract on July 30 to compete with Nick Harris for the job. He made the final 53-man roster, but was waived after week 1. =Toronto Argonauts (2009)= On May 29, 2009, Johnson was signed by the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League and competed with fellow new import kicker Justin Medlock for the kicking spot vacated by the retirement of Mike Vanderjagt. At the end of training camp, the Argos elected to keep both kickers and coach Bart Andrus elected to start Johnson for game one and placed Medlock on the practice roster. Johnson, however, was injured on the opening kickoff when he separated his shoulder when tackling the return man and Medlock was slated to kick for game two of the 2009 Toronto Argonauts season. On May 11, 2010, Johnson was released by the Argonauts. =Saskatchewan Roughriders (2010-11)= On July 22, 2010, Johnson was signed by the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League to compete with incumbent punter, import Louie Sakoda for the kicking spot after Sakoda's poor performance in the previous week's game against the Edmonton Eskimos. Johnson was awarded the start against the Calgary Stampeders for the July 24, 2010 matchup. Late in the 2010 season, Johnson became a popular personality in rider nation owing to his sense of humour in interviews and the novelty he built up around his moustache; during Grey Cup week, fans were seen sporting fake moustaches and custom-made jerseys bearing Johnson's number 11 and the name \\"Slick Eddie\\", the punter's popular nickname, on the back. He played in six games in 2011 before being sidelined with a nagging injury. He was eventually placed on the nine-game injured list and sat out the rest of the season. Johnson was released on December 13, 2011.http://www.riderville.com/article/rider-roster-moves-2 References External links * KFFL.com Profile Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Newport Beach, California Category:American football punters Category:Canadian football punters Category:American players of Canadian football Category:Idaho State Bengals football players Category:Minnesota Vikings players Category:Cincinnati Bengals players Category:New York Giants players Category:Jacksonville Jaguars players Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Denver Broncos players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Toronto Argonauts players Category:Saskatchewan Roughriders players ","title":"Eddie Johnson (punter)"},{"id":"20116953","text":"A special election was held in Illinois's 5th congressional district in 2009 to fill the seat vacated by Rahm Emanuel. On April 7, Democratic nominee Michael Quigley defeated Republican nominee Rosanna Pulido and Green nominee Matt Reichel. Quigley was sworn in on April 21 and will serve out the current congressional term. Emanuel officially resigned from the House of Representatives, effective January 2, in a letter to his constituents and Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Emanuel was named White House Chief of Staff by incoming President-elect Barack Obama. Emanuel was first elected to Congress from Illinois's 5th congressional district in 2002. His resignation followed being re-elected to a fourth term. The governor's office announced that a special primary election would be held on March 3 and special general election would be held on April 7. State law requires the governor to set a date for a congressional special election within five days of a vacancy being created. State law mandates that a general election must be held within 115 days of the vacancy. In an effort to cut costs and help save money, the date of the special general election coincided with municipal elections scheduled in Chicago, Cook County, and surrounding metropolitan areas. There were 24 candidates representing three political parties in the March 3 special primary election. The Democrats had 13 candidates; the Republicans had six candidates; and the Greens had five candidates. Quigley, a 50-year-old Cook County commissioner, won the Democratic Party's primary with 22% of the vote. He defeated a strong field of Democrats, including state representatives John Fritchey (District 11) and Sara Feigenholtz (District 12), physician Victor Forys, and Chicago City Council alderman Patrick J. O'Connor (40th Ward). Pulido, a Mexican-American and director of the Illinois Minuteman Project, won the Republican Party's primary with 25% of the vote. She defeated a handful of local businessmen, including Tom Hanson, David Anderson, Gregory Bedell, Daniel S. Kay, and Jon Stewart. Reichel, a 27-year-old activist and political operative, won the Green Party's primary with 34% of the vote. He defeated four other candidates for the party's nomination. Reichel's margin of victory over fellow Green Party nominee Deb Gordils was extremely small‚Äîonly 11 votes. Reichel won with 166 compared to Gordils' 155. Nearly a month after the primaries, the three candidates took part in the April 7 special general election. Democratic Party candidate Michael Quigley defeated Republican Party candidate Rosanna Pulido and Green Party candidate Matt Reichel. Quigley won with 30,561 votes (69.2%); Pulido had 10,662 (24.2%) and Reichel had 2,911 (6.6%). The election did not receive a great deal of coverage, due to the district's heavy Democratic lean. The Republican Party did not put up a top-tier candidate, acknowledging that they were not even focusing on the raceAlex Isenstadt: Republicans' outlook remains bleak Politico, April 2, 2009. This is highlighted in the fact that the Republican nominee was the founder of an anti-illegal-immigration group, running in a district that is one-quarter Hispanic. The real fight was for the Democratic nomination, which would almost assure being elected to Congress. In fact, over 12,000 more votes were cast in the Democratic Primary than there were in the general election.

The single-arch bridge has a span of 17.1 m and a width of 5.9 m. The arch vault consists of large voussoirs and shows a comparatively flat profile (span to rise ratio 3:1).

His films include the 1985 Michael J. Fox comedy film Teen Wolf, which was a considerable box office success. Daniel, the son of a noted surgeon, was expected to follow in his father's footsteps. After returning to his native Tennessee from the Vietnam War, he chose to enter the advertising business, where he directed several commercials before moving to Los Angeles. There, his friendship with television producer Hugh Wilson enabled him to start a career in the television industry as a director and producer for Wilson's sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati. Daniel continued to work on shows like Magnum, P.I. and Newhart, until he eventually grew restless with television following the failure of a sitcom he had worked on and chose to make the leap into feature films. Daniel continued to direct throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with his other works including the comedies Like Father Like Son, K-9, The Super, and Beethoven's 2nd. He continued to helm episodes of television as well, directing episodes of shows including Everybody Loves Raymond and Caroline in the City. His final film, Home Alone 4, premiered on television in late 2002, after which he retired from the entertainment industry. Daniel then moved to Tennessee for several years and began refocusing on his passion for photography and music. In later interviews he described his entertainment career in a negative light. Eventually, he moved to Chicago, where he died in April 2016 from complications of Parkinson's disease. Early life  Daniel was born as Rollin Augustus Daniel III in Nashville, Tennessee on August 4, 1942. His father, Dr. Rollin A. Daniel Jr., was Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery At Vanderbilt University and a founding member of the American Board of Thoracic Surgery. Rod Daniel described his father as \\"a big-deal doctor who plucked out my mom, this retiring little country girl, and then couldn't get out of the hospital. The man never wanted to come home. He was unavailable. God knows, I went to the graveyard many times and told [him] off. Because that was something I had to work out.\\" Rod Daniel attended high school at Battle Ground Academy in Franklin, Tennessee (near Nashville) and graduated in 1960. He was inducted into the school's Alumni Hall of Fame in 2013. He was a student at Davidson College for two years, but then transferred to Vanderbilt University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1964. Daniel said that although there was an expectation for him to be like his father, who had also attended Vanderbilt, he chose instead to enter the advertising business after returning to Nashville following his service in the Vietnam War as a lieutenant of the United States Army. Daniel's first job in advertising was at the Nashville firm of Dawson, Daniels, Sullivan, & Dillon, where he began making commercials for one of their clients, department store chain Cain-Sloan. Daniel soon accepted a job opportunity in Atlanta for a broadcast producer, but he eventually ended up cycling through jobs all over the city before eventually settling at production company Jayan Films. Although Daniel professed he was initially only interested in the business side of the company, he soon began directing commercials for it as well. Daniel then went to Chicago in 1976 to work at Topol, a commercial production company. He directed commercials for companies including Hallmark Cards and Procter & Gamble before heading to Los Angeles about one year later. Career While in Los Angeles, Daniel began working alongside television producer Hugh Wilson. Wilson had a new show in development, called WKRP in Cincinnati, and invited Daniel to watch the taping of the pilot. Daniel agreed to come, and while watching the taping, he felt that he \\"just instinctively knew how to do what they were doing so I pursued it aggressively.\\" Daniel saw an opportunity to leave his job in commercials, and told Wilson that he wanted a job on the show if production went well. Wilson obliged, and gave Daniel the associate producer position. Eventually, he moved up to director, and eventually directed 33 episodes over the series' run. Daniel found the show to be \\"a great training ground in terms of storyline and character. It really spoils you.\\" After three years at WKRP, Daniel then directed more episodic television, including episodes of shows like Newhart and Magnum, P.I.. He directed several episodes of The Duck Factory, starring Jim Carrey, but the series was unsuccessful, and Daniel decided to switch to films. In a 1985 interview with The Tennessean, Daniel opined that \\"On television there is some really good writing, but not much. Television is just a machine, a sausage machine. If you really want to do some quality work, you just don't have time.\\" He said to the Chicago Tribune in 2011 that he \\"could teach you to direct sitcoms in 30 minutes. It's outrageous how easy it is, like stealing money. What do you say [to] Bob Newhart ‚Äî 'OK, be Bob Newhart'?\\" Daniel changed his agent, something he described as \\"almost an impossible move\\", and told them he wanted to make a film. A month after he changed agents, Daniel received the script to Teen Wolf and enjoyed it. He met with Michael J. Fox and \\"liked him instantly\\". According to Daniel, he was hired after every other director interviewed by 20th Century Fox simply said the film was about a werewolf, while Daniel said it was about a father and son. Daniel told the Chicago Tribune that \\"a whole lot of Teen Wolf is who I wish I could have been, who I wanted my father to be more like.\\" Shot over 25 days, Teen Wolf was a box office success upon its early fall release in 1985, grossing $80 million on a $1.4 million budget. Daniel reflected positively on the film, saying to The Tennessean, \\"I'm so proud of Teen Wolf. It was a chance for me to start over. It really was a well-written script. It makes a little statement. It's a clean, classy little movie.\\" After Teen Wolfs success, Daniel began searching for his next project. To The Tennessean, he expressed his desire to be selective with his screenplay choices, something television had not allowed him to do. Daniel's next film was the 1987 comedy Like Father Like Son, a film starring Kirk Cameron and Dudley Moore that again allowed him to explore father-son themes. The film grossed $34 million at the domestic box office. After Like Father, Like Son, he directed the 1989 film K-9, a comedy starring Jim Belushi. Critical reception was mostly negative, but the film grossed $78 million worldwide and spawned two direct-to-video sequels, K-911 and K-9: P.I., both of which featured Belushi reprising his role. Next, Daniel directed The Super, released in 1991, which starred Joe Pesci as a wealthy superintendent forced to live in one of his own poorly-maintained buildings. The film received negative reviews from critics and, produced at a cost of $22 million, failed to recoup its budget at the domestic box office, only taking in $11 million. Roger Ebert criticized Daniel's direction, saying that the cast deserved better, and that Daniel failed to deliver solid comic payoffs. Janet Maslin was more positive and wrote that Daniel's direction was \\"snappy and broad\\" and that he offered many opportunities for Pesci to \\"show off his talents for physical clowning\\". In the 2011 Tribune interview, Daniel said that he knew The Super had unsolved problems with its screenplay when he accepted the job, but began shooting the film anyway. The next film directed by Daniel was the 1993 film Beethoven's 2nd, the sequel to the successful comedy film Beethoven. It was his final theatrical film. The film was not a critical success, but it ended up grossing $53 million domestically and $64 million in foreign markets, leading to a total gross of $118 million. \\"The Day I Fall in Love\\", an original song performed by James Ingram and Dolly Parton for the film, was nominated for an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and a Golden Globe. After Beethoven's 2nd, Daniel signed on as director for military comedy McHale's Navy, based on the television series of the same name; he was eventually replaced by Bryan Spicer. He returned to directing television in the 1990s, including episodes of shows like Caroline in the City, Everybody Loves Raymond, and Suddenly Susan. He also directed several television films, such as Genius and Alley Cats Strike, both for the Disney Channel. In 2002, his final directing credit, the television film Home Alone 4, premiered. After the film aired, Daniel retired from the business, noting to the Tribune that he anticipated to do much more work but found himself receiving very few offers. \\"And I know why: If you work in the arts for a living, you are paid to know what's in the air, what the mood is, the whole societal thing. And I don't care how hip you are, when it's over, it's over. I couldn't artistically reflect how the world changed. And that feels like you woke up one day and were thrown out the window.\\" Daniel's main influence as a director were character-based filmmakers such as Frank Capra, Martin Ritt, Sidney Lumet and John Huston. In 2011, Daniel was sought out by Christopher Borrelli, a Chicago Tribune reporter who found he had walked out of several of Daniel's works. Borrelli was able to interview Daniel, who was unashamed about the quality of his work. Daniel told Borrelli that he directed material he was not passionate about because the job paid him well, and that he would likely not have purchased a ticket to any of his own films. \\"I don't rank with the greats ... which is not to say I didn't believe in what I did. But I hold no illusions.\\" Personal life Daniel married Martha \\"Marti\\" Mueller in 1968 and they remained married until Daniel's death. They had two children, Lucas and John. Lucas spoke warmly of his childhood, believing that Daniel's ability to channel his feelings and issues about his own father in Teen Wolf had helped him. Daniel and his family had lived in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Tarzana. After Daniel's retirement from the industry, he moved back to a rural home in Franklin, Tennessee for a few years, but found himself longing for city living. He then moved to downtown Chicago, where he lived the remainder of his life. He had a vacation home in Glen Arbor, Michigan which is on a small strip of land between Lake Michigan and Glen Lake. In the summer he enjoyed salmon fishing there. Daniel was a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He described his increasing detachment with film to the Tribune, telling them that he had disliked The Dark Knight but placed that fact more on him than the film and people who received it positively. He stated he never bought tickets to modern films, and spoke negatively of violence in the media. \\"I was in Vietnam, and when I came back I saw Bonnie and Clyde and promptly threw up. I can't go there. It's just not in my bones.\\" Daniel was an amateur musician, and played bass in a rock group called \\"The Wild Hots\\". The band consisted of a group of former Battleground Academy and Vanderbilt University students with whom he performed in the 1960s. They continued to rejoin for a reunion show about every five years, often without Daniel who was busy in California making films. When he moved back to Tennessee, he reunited with his band members and began performing around Nashville, mostly for charity functions. Another of Daniel's hobbies was photography. He did fine art photographs, mostly black and white, which are largely scenes of rural America. To get his images, he often took time off to ride his Harley-Davidson motorcycle through the rural southwest U.S. for weeks, capturing scenes of forgotten towns and empty buildings. His work has been exhibited in juried shows and galleries in the U.S. Daniel was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2002. He underwent deep brain stimulation surgery in 2012.

The left-handed-batting Taylor was listed as tall and . Signed by the Milwaukee Braves in 1956, Taylor was traded with Taylor Phillips to the Cubs for Eddie Haas, Don Kaiser and Bob Rush on December 5, 1957. He made his big league debut on April 20, 1958 against the St. Louis Cardinals. Appearing as a pinch hitter for Gene Fodge, he drew a walk in his first plate appearance. Overall, Taylor appeared in 96 games in 1958, hitting .259 with 78 hits, six home runs and 36 RBI. In 110 games in 1959, Taylor hit .269 with 13 home runs and 43 runs batted in in 110 games. His 13 intentional walks were the fourth most that season. Taylor was involved in a rather peculiar situation in a game on June 30 of that year, between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Stan Musial was at the plate, with a count of 3‚Äì1. Pitcher Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, however Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. To Anderson's disappointment, the ball flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out. Taylor slumped in 1960, hitting only .207 in 150 at-bats. He lost his starting catching role that year and played in only 74 games. Taylor was the team's second most used catcher in 1961, behind Dick Bertell. In 1961, he hit .238 with eight home runs and 23 RBI in 235 at-bats (89 games). Taylor began the 1962 season with the Cubs, hitting .133 in 15 at-bats with them. On April 26, he was traded to the Mets for Bob Smith. In 68 games with the Mets, he hit .222 with three home runs and 20 RBI. Overall, he hit .214 in 173 at-bats that season. In 1963‚Äîhis final season‚ÄîTaylor played for three different teams. He began the year with the Mets and hit .257 in 41 at-bats with them. On July 1, he was traded with Charlie Neal to the Reds for another catcher, Jesse Gonder. He played in three games for the Reds, collecting no hits in six at-bats. On August 1, he was traded to the Indians for Gene Green. He collected three hits in 10 at-bats for the Indians. Overall, he hit .235 with no home runs and seven RBI in 51 at-bats. He played his final game on August 6. Overall, Taylor played six years in the majors, hitting .245 with 309 hits, 47 doubles, nine triples, 33 home runs and 147 RBI in 473 games. Taylor served in the United States Navy during the Korean Conflict. He died October 8, 2019.

Opened in 1981 and overseen by the KGB, it became the first legal rock music venue in Leningrad. Overall, it was the largest rock scene in the Soviet Union, which featured such bands as Televizor, Kino, Alisa, Aquarium, Zoopark, Piknik, Automatic Satisfiers, DDT, NEP, Grazhdanskaya Oborona (formally), and became an important influence on the Russian rock. History Leningrad was a centre of rock music in the Soviet Union, perhaps due to its geographical proximity with Finland, which made it easier to access Western music. Attempts to create rock clubs began as early as 1973, but they were largely unsuccessful. The Leningrad Rock Club formed in 1981 under Leonid Brezhnev. It was intended to be organized similarly to the Union of Soviet Composers and censored lyrics and issued permits to perform in an effort to prevent the bands from making much that was too controversial. However, by providing musicians with a place to meet, perform, and discuss their music, the club provided for an unprecedented amount of creative freedom and helped lead to the Russian rock revolution. The club effectively closed in 1991. Membership card number one was issued to \\"Beatles-ologist\\" Kolya Vasin. There were restrictions on which bands could perform at the club for most of its history, and groups had to audition before a commission. Additionally, the club was monitored by the KGB, the Communist Party, and the Komsomol Communist Youth Organization. More radical bands, such as the highly political Televizor and punk singer Svinya, were banned from the club. However, these restrictions lessened in 1987 under Mikhail Gorbachev. Influence The Leningrad Rock Club provided access to a new, Western form of music for an audience of unprecedented size in the Soviet Union. It led to an emergence of a rock industry in the Soviet Union. Its performers began to tour, perform on television, and have their songs played on the radio. This was part of a growing prominence of Western culture in the Soviet Union. However, some musicians disliked the mainstream fame and acceptance the Leningrad Rock Club brought them. \\"We are so official now, so taken to heart, that the people who were with us before are not sure of us,\\" Boris Grebenshchikov of Aquarium said in an interview with The New York Times. \\"Nobody can believe that the system has changed. They think we must have changed.\\" The Leningrad Rock Club was viewed by some artists as a sign of compliance with the Soviet government. Artists that are associated with The Leningrad Rock Club include V. Tsoi, M. Kuznetsov, and Sologub.

Early in his career, he worked as an Ottoman bureaucrat in Palestine and Lebanon. Darwaza had long been a sympathizer of Arab nationalism and became an activist of that cause following the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1916, joining the nationalist al-Fatat society. As such, he campaigned for the union of Greater Syria (modern-day Levant) and vehemently opposed Zionism and foreign mandates in Arab lands. From 1922 to 1927, he served as an educator and as the principal at the an-Najah National School where he implemented a pro-Arab nationalist educational system, promoting the ideas of Arab independence and unity. Darwaza's particular brand of Arab nationalism was influenced by Islam and his beliefs in Arab unity and the oneness of Arabic culture. Later, Darwaza co- founded the nationalist Istiqlal party in Palestine and was a principal organizer of anti-British demonstrations. In 1937, he was exiled to Damascus as a result of his activities and from there he helped support the Arab revolt in the Mandatory Palestine. He was incarcerated in Damascus by French authorities for his involvement in the revolt, and while in prison he began to study the Qur'an and its interpretations. In 1945, after he was released, Darwaza eventually compiled his own interpretation entitled al-Tafsir al- Hadith. In 1946, he joined the Arab Higher Committee led by Haj Amin al- Husseini, but resigned the next year after being disenfranchised by al- Husayni's methods. He left for Syria afterward and briefly aided in the unity talks between Syria and Egypt in the mid-1950s. By the time of his death in 1984, Darwaza had written over thirty books and published numerous articles on the Palestinian question, Arab history, and Islam. Biography =Early life and background= Darwaza was born to a middle-class Sunni Muslim mercantile family in Nablus. The Darwaza family had long been involved in textiles and had extensive trade relationships with merchants in Beirut and Damascus. In his memoirs, Izzat writes \\"The import of [textile] goods from the outside was, for the most part, through Beirut and Damascus.\\"Doumani, 1995, pp. 59-61. Izzat's father, 'Abd al-Hadi Darwaza and his paternal grandfather Darwish Darwaza, owned a store in the Khan al-Tujjar of Nablus. Izzat recalled, \\"From what I remember from my father and through my grandfather, the title merchant or merchants in Nablus mostly referred to owners of commercial textile and cloth shops. In Nablus, these shops were confined, or mostly confined, to a caravansary called Khan al-Tujjar, in the middle of Nablus.\\"Doumani, 1995, p. 57. Izzat received elementary and preparatory education in Ottoman government- run schools in the city. In addition to Arabic, he learned Turkish and English, as well as a basic knowledge of French which he strengthened in by the end of his formal education.Matthews, 2006, p.267. Darwaza left school without going to Istanbul or Beirut to finish his education as was the custom of his generation. Instead, he educated himself, and according to Rashid Khalidi, became \\"a self-taught intellectual.\\"Khalidi, 1993, p.178. =Loyalty to dissidence toward the Ottoman Empire= Originally, Darwaza supported the Ottoman Empire based on his feelings of identification with Islam and of belonging to the larger Ottoman Muslim ummah (\\"nation\\"). In 1906, he served in the local Ottoman administration as a clerk in the Department of Telegraphic and Postal Services (DTPS) in Nablus. His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the Galilee and northern Samaria). He was also an Arabist and was enthusiastic about the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman government would institute reforms and grant the Arabs autonomy within the framework of the empire. His loyalty to the Ottomans eroded, however, due to the impact of the new governments's Turkification policies which he viewed as repressive against his ideals. Because of his dissatisfaction with the Young Turks, Darwaza was driven to support Arab independence from the empire.Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 237. In 1908, he joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), but withdrew soon after because of its Turkish nationalist political agenda. He played an active role in establishing a branch for the Party of Harmony and Freedom in Nablus in 1911. The party was founded in Istanbul and joined by Arab members to counter the policies of the CUP. In 1913, he joined an anti- Zionist group based in Nablus that sought to prevent the sale of Arab-owned land to Jews by submitting petitions to the Ottoman sultan, or by buying land for sale to preempt its purchase by Jews. In June 1913, he helped to prepare and became secretary of the First Palestinian Congress (also known as the Arab Congress of 1913) in Paris. In congress, he was also the delegate for the Jamma'in subdistrict of the District of Nablus. Meanwhile, Darwaza was still working in the DTPS. In 1914, he established the Arab Scientific Society whose purpose was to spread Arabic culture in the region through the establishment of Arabic schools. The society did not succeed, however, due to the outbreak of World War I. Within the DTPS, Darwaza was appointed commissioner and deputy for the Nablus Post Office. He was promoted again‚Äîthis time as director of postal stamp sales in Beirut. =Promoting unity with Syria= During World War I, Darwaza served as Postal Directorate-General of Beirut and retained this post until 1918.Muslih, 1989, pp. 146-148. In 1916, while serving with the Ottoman army in the Sinai Peninsula, he joined the underground al-Fatat organization through Ahmad Qadri, a high-ranking member from Damascus. The aim of al-Fatat was to liberate and unite the Arab lands under Ottoman rule.Izzat Muhammad Darwaza MSN Encarta. Archived 2009-10-31. In the wake of the Arab Revolt of 1916, Darwaza left the Ottoman civil service to serve in King Faisal's provisional government in Damascus. Ideologically, Darwaza became an Arab nationalist endorsing the concept of a Greater Syrian Arab state. Following the World War I Armistice, Darwaza held several political posts including Secretary-General of al-Fatat from May 1919 to March 1920, Secretary of the Muslim-Christian Association's Nablus branch, and Secretary of the First Palestine Arab Congress in Jerusalem in 1919. During the spring and summer of 1919, a vigorous political campaign was waged by the Arab politicians in Palestine who were divided into \\"Younger Politicians\\" and \\"Older Politicians\\". The campaign was centered on the political future of Palestine, and Darwaza, a Younger Politician, played a central role. The Younger Politicians consisted of Arab nationalists who sought to unite Palestine with King Faisal's Syria while the Older Politicians consisted of Palestinian nationalists who preferred that Palestine be an independent entity. Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan‚Äîanother leading al-Fatat member from Nablus‚Äîlobbied Arab groups in Jerusalem to advocate Syro-Palestinian unity before the arrival of the King-Crane Commission on 10 June 1919. They first met with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Kamil al-Husayni of al-Nadi al-Arabi party and they immediately expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet Raghib al-Nashashibi, Hussam ad-Din Jarallah, and Aref al-Dajani, supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older Politicians of Jerusalem to a meeting at his house. When it was made clear that Musa al-Husayni, a leader of the Older Politicians, was now in favor of unity, all of the other Older Politicians followed suit.Muslih, 1989, pp. 193-194. When the commission arrived in Jaffa, it concluded on 27 June that it was in favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a British Mandate.Muslih, 1989, p. 196. In the first week of July 1919, the General Syrian Congress (GSC) held its first meeting in Damascus and Darwaza was its secretary. The GSC called for the immediate independence of Syria as a sovereign state under a constitutional monarchy and underlined its opposition to the establishment of Zionism in southern Syria (Palestine).Kayyali, 1978, p. 69. Along with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Aref al-Aref, Darwaza founded and became an officer of the Palestinian Society in Damascus. The organization urged all societies and clubs in Palestine to cooperate and condemn the San Remo Conference's decision to grant Great Britain a mandate over Palestine and Transjordan.Kayyali, 1978, p. 79. The hope of Darwaza and the Younger Politicians for unity with Syria were curtailed when it became known that King Faisal was aligning himself with the leaders of the Zionist movement because \\"they [the Zionists] were helping us [the Arabs] in the [Paris Peace] conference.\\" Afterward, Darwaza believed King Faisal did not devote to the Palestine issue its deserved attention. Faisal was deposed by the French in July 1920. An event that further deteriorated Darwaza's ambitions of Arab unity was the confirmation of the British Mandate over Palestine at the San Remo Conference on 24 April 1920.Muslih, 1989, p. 203. His experience in Damascus revealed to him that the universalism of Arab nationalism was not as concrete as its advocates had thought, and the military might of the colonial powers‚ÄîFrance and Great Britain‚Äîwere an overwhelming force to contend with. =Educator in Nablus= Darwaza continued his political activity, representing Nablus in the Fourth Palestinian Congress in May 1921 and the Seventh Palestinian Congress in June 1928. From 1922 to 1927, he served as the principal of the an-Najah National School (later to become an-Najah National University) where he initiated and nurtured an Arab nationalist political educational process. Darwaza wrote textbooks and was an educator himself. One of his students who later became a nationalist politician, Akram Zu'aiter, wrote that Darwaza \\"used to give us a weekly lesson on the principles of Nationalism and [modern] society, in a way which sharpened our thought and broadened our horizons.\\" Zuaiter also recalls that Darwaza wrote up nationalist and historical plays that his students would perform in.Kedourie, Gammer, Kostiner, and Shemesh, 2003, p. 31. In 1927, Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, the leader of the Young Men's Muslim Association of Haifa, a prominent merchant, and future associate of Darwaza, invited him to his home to speak to a large group of students and notables about nationalist (qawmiyya) and patriotic (wataniyya) education. This was recognition that Darwaza's contribution to the spread of Arab nationalist sentiments gained influence not only in an-Najah School, but throughout Palestine.Matthews, 2006, p.52. =Fight against the British Mandate= Darwaza (right) and Awni Abd al-Hadi (left) during their internment in the British military camp of Sarafand al-Amar, 1936 Darwaza became a member of the Arab Executive Committee and in 1930 was appointed by rival nationalist Haj Amin al-Husseini (now the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) as the General Administrator of the Waqf (Islamic religious trust) under the Supreme Muslim Council.Palestinian personalities D Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs. (PASSIA).Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p. 114. In 1931, he convinced his city's MCA to change its name to the Patriotic Arab Association. Unlike other Arab politicians at the time, Darwaza supported a combination of pan-Arabism, Islamism, and dedication to the Palestinian nationalist ideal. He began to edit in the al-Ja'miyya al-Arabiyya newspaper in the early 1930s and in December 1931-January 1932, he wrote articles encouraging Arabs to fight British policies in the Middle East, to unite in the face of growing dangers, and to renew their drive towards freedom and independence.Kayyali, 1978, p. 167. In August 1932, he along with Awni Abd al-Hadi and others founded the Istiqlal (Independence) party in Palestine, an offshoot of al-Fatat. Originally, the Istiqlal operated in Syria, then Transjordan, but reassembled in Palestine after facing disappointing circumstances in both those territories. The party coaxed Palestinians towards defying British rule by staging demonstrations and political and social boycotts. Darwaza refused to allow the Istiqlal to participate in meetings between local Palestinian political parties and the British high-commissioner.Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p. 97. Darwaza wrote an article on 21 June 1933, vehemently attacking Palestinian \\"vested interests\\". He argued that the wealthy Arab notables of Palestine were subservient to the British and the Zionists and would willingly leave Palestine for other countries, while the poor and middle-class Arabs had to remain to fight and die in their battle against British oppression.Kayyali, 1978, p. 172. Darwaza helped instigate and organize the 1933 demonstrations in Jaffa which protested British policy in Palestine and continued Jewish immigration. Darwaza was one of the principal organizers of the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine which first erupted in his hometown of Nablus with the launch of the Palestinian general strike. Along with Abd al-Hadi, Darwaza was arrested by the British authorities in June and imprisoned in the military camp at Sarafand al-Amar.Elpeleg, 1993, p. 43. The Mufti sent a delegation consisting of Darwaza, Mu'in al-Madi, and Abd al-Hadi to Baghdad, then to Riyadh to discuss the situation and upon their return on 6 January 1937, they revealed that the advice given to them was to cease hostilities.Nafi, 1998, p. 249. During the revolt, in 1937, Darwaza was exiled from Palestine by British authorities to Damascus.Levenberg, 1993, p. 69. Later in that year, Darwaza held several meetings with Nuri al-Sa'id of Iraq to explore various solutions to help the Arabs avoid appearing intransigent.Nafi, 1998, p. 297. Despite attempts to calm the situation, in Damascus, Darwaza established and headed the Central Committee for National Jihad in Palestine which echoed Izz al-Din al-Qassam's call for a holy war against the British and Zionism. Darwaza had many encounters with al-Qassam, describing him as \\"a man lacking in arrogance or self-love. He was open and available to all of the people and the people loved him. And he lived the life of a mujahid.\\"The Life and Thought of 'Izz- Id-Din Al-Qassam . The Islamic Quarterly, London. Darwaza worked closely with the Mufti, who was now under house arrest in Beirut, to garner support and supplies for the revolt and supervise the Arab rebels in Palestine. In late 1939, he was accused by French military authorities of helping Palestinian rebels in the revolt, tried by a military court, and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the Citadel of Damascus. While his exile by the British abruptly curtailed his political life, his imprisonment marked the beginning of a new life wherein the Quran becomes a major concern for the next several years.Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 225. He was released in November 1944.Abu- Ghazaleh, 1973, p. 22. After his release, Darwaza was unable to return to Nablus because British authorities had issued an order preventing him from entering Palestine. As a result, he left for Turkey, mostly staying in Bursa until the end of 1945. The Mufti re-established the Arab Higher Committee (AHC) in late 1946 and Darwaza joined the ten-member council upon a request from the Mufti.Khalaf, 1991, p. 267. Darwaza, along with Emil Ghuri and Mu'in al-Madi, served as the AHC's delegates to the September 1947 convention of the Arab League's Political Committee in Lebanon. With support from the Transjordanian representative, Salih Jaber, the Prime Minister of Iraq, openly criticized the delegates and questioned the AHC's right to even send delegates to the convention.Khalaf, 1991, p. 178. Later that year, Darwaza resigned from the AHC due to the Mufti's unbending attitude towards wider representation.Khalaf, 1991, p. 130. =Later life= After resigning from the AHC, Darwaza spent the rest of his life in the modern state of Syria where he left politics to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite.Podeh and Ma'oz, 1999, p. 29. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.Podeh and Ma'oz, 1999, p. 26. In 1983 Darwaza granted Palestinian historian Muhammad Y. Muslih an eight-day interview and allowed him to photo-copy his memoirs in entirety. Muslih noted that Darwaza was failing in health at the time.Muslih, 1988, p. xi. He died in Damascus in 1984 at the age of 96.Zebiri, 1993, pp. 145-146. Darwaza had three daughters, Najah, Salma, and Rudaina and a son, Zuhair. Literary works Darwaza in traditional Arab robe One of the first modern histories of the Arab nation in contrast to a history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920s under the title Lessons of Arab History: From Antiquity to Present Times. In the book, Darwaza begins by describing the origins of the Semitic peoples, the rise of Islam, the end of Arab rule in the Middle East by Turkic groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended to be used as a textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later Iraq, hence its simplified and direct language. Nonetheless, it played a pioneering role in the development of pan-Arabism.Choueiri, 2000, pp. 25-26. In 1934, Darwaza published a widely read story, The Angel and the Land Broker, reflecting popular Arab sentiments against the growing \\"Zionist threat\\" and attacking brokers who tempted Palestinian land owners to sell their land to Jews. The story describes methods used by Zionists to entice Arab landowners to sell their land and the main characters in the story are an illiterate farmer and a Jewish girl from Tel Aviv who encourages the former to spend himself deep into debt, forcing him to sell his land at a price far below its value.Sufian and LeVine, 2007, p. 294. Later in his lifetime after leaving politics, Darwaza published memoirs that discussed in detail the city of Nablus in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to Youssef Choueiri, \\"he gives a graphic and almost exhaustive description of his hometown... its mosques, residential quarters, orchards, industries, and inhabitants. Moreover, he dwells at length of the social composition of the town endeavoring to reveal the open conflict between 'feudal families' and the new generation of middle traders, functionaries, civil servants, and teachers.\\" =Quranic studies and interpretations= While he was imprisoned in Damascus, Darwaza was provided with an opportunity to read and reflect upon the Quran. He states \\"I considered [this opportunity] an act of divine [favor] and started reading whatever books of exegesis and qur'anic studies were accessible to me.\\" During his incarceration, he compiled three books dealing with the Quran and conceived the idea of writing a modern tafsir (\\"interpretation\\"). His time in Turkey exposed him to the libraries of Bursa and it was there where he wrote the rough draft of his tafsir entitled al- Tafsir al-Hadith. Darwaza states in this exegesis he would \\"uncover the wisdom of revelation, the fundamental concepts of the Qur'an and the whole range of its subject matter and present it in a new style and new sequential order.\\" Al-Tafsir al-Hadith was generally aimed at the Muslim youth who had been alienated by the traditional interpretations of the Quran. Darwaza placed much emphasis on the close relationship between the text of the Quran and the environment in which it was revealed. He rejected the hadith which states the Qur'an was originally preserved on a tablet in the seventh heaven, sent down to lowest heaven and from there gradually to Muhammad. After the completion of the rough draft, he wrote a volume of four chapters, Qur'an al-Majid, which served as an introduction for the tafsir.Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 226. Darwaza stresses a close connection between the Quran and the biography of the Muhammad (sira) and states that the Quran fully reflects various stages between the Quran and the career of Muhammad.Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 228. He also emphasizes that both the angels and the jinn are spoken in the Quran not for their own sake, but to reinforce Muhammad's missions and goals.Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 232. He contends that the presentation of the Quran and its suras was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of Abu Bakr was to collect the Quran between its two covers and transcribe it into one copy, while Uthman's task was to fix the transcription and unify it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran. Darwaza was convinced that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking. Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole tafsir‚Äîwhich Darwaza did‚Äîhe had to justify his position by seeking a fatwa from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 240. Legacy Throughout his life, Darwaza was an Arab nationalist and supported the unity of Syria and Palestine. His particular brand of Arab nationalism was influenced by Islam, his belief in Arab unity, and the oneness of Arabic culture. According to his perspective, the ideology's main points were the Arabic language, the Arab homeland, a shared Arab history and common Arab interests. Although Darwaza believed that Arab nationalism pre-dated Islam, he also maintained that Islam expanded Arab territory and \\"stamped them with the eternal mark of Arab nationalism.\\" According to Muhammad Y. Muslih, this meant that Islam had provided Arabs with \\"spiritual, cultural, and legal unity and within the framework of that unity the Arab individual formed his moral and social beliefs, irrespective of where he lived and through it the Arabs were able to preserve national identity and maintain their culture in the face of foreign invaders, including the Ottomans\\". Darwaza contends that Arab nationalism is not a new concept borrowed from the West and asserts the constituents of Arab nationalism are stronger than those which make up the modern forms of nationalism in the world.Hawting and Shareef, 1993, pp. 245-246. His ideas helped the spread the word of secular pan-Arabism against religious nationalists and those who believed in separate Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian destinies. In the mid-1950s, Darwaza asserted that the first stage of Arab union should be based on a merger between Egypt and Syria. In his opinion, a union between the northern Arabs (Syria) and the southern Arabs (Egypt) would facilitate the adherence of other Arab states.Podeh and Ma'oz, 1999, p. 7. He believed that Egypt's capabilities and human resources compelled it to fill the role of an Arab \\"Prussia\\". Darwaza remarked on Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egyptian president and founder of the short-lived union, saying \\"Since the Arab revolt against the Turks, no Arab leader has been up to the level of events except for Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir. He emerged and vanished like a shooting star.\\" Rashid Khalidi states about Darwaza, \\"Moved as he was by the civilization of Arabs, he evoked a distant Arab past. For obvious reasons Islam was central to that past. But in the case of Darwaza, Islam was important not as the binding substance of the nation, but as a culture and civilization. In other words, culture, language, and history not religious solidarity were posited as the glue that was to hold the Arab nation together.\\" According to Khalidi, Darwaza contributed to Arab nationalism in the practical and intellectual domains greatly.Khalidi, 1993, p. 179.

Villepigue (1826-?) served as Secretary of State of Florida from July 1, 1853 to January 13, 1863.https://dos.myflorida.com/about-the- department/office-history/  Early life  Villepigue was born in South Carolina. He was descended from a Frenchman, Francois Villepigue, who immigrated from France to Saint-Domingue, a French colony, in 1788, but was killed by his slaves in a slave rebellion in 1800 in the Haitian Revolution. Francois' wife received last-minute warning and escaped with their two sons, arriving with Pierre Laurent Jumelle at Charleston, and settling in Camden, South Carolina. One of the Villepigues' sons, Paul Francis became a prominent merchant in Camden, and one of his seven children was Fredrick L. Villepigue. Villepigue graduated from South Carolina College and moved to Florida in the 1840s. The 1850 Census listed him as a 21-year-old lawyer living in Jefferson County.  Florida Secretary of State  Villepigue was appointed to fill the unexpired term of Charles W. Downing, Jr. as Secretary of State of Florida on July 1, 1853, and was elected to that post on July 25, 1853, serving until January 13, 1863. The 1860 Census listed Villepigue having a personal estate of $200.00. On April 19 of that year, he married to Margaret Watson Armstrong, the eldest daughter of General James Watson Armstrong in the Presbyterian Church by the Rev. David Willis, in Macon, Georgia. Villepigue had one son, Harry, born in November 1863, and a daughter, Jeanne, born around 1861.  Civil War service  On January 11, 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, Villepigue publicly affixed the Great Seal of the State of Florida to Florida's Declaration of Independence on the east portico of the State Capitol, turned to face an assembled crowd, and \\"in a clear distinct voice proclaimed Florida an independent nation. A second later 15 cannon were fired in salute of the new state and shouting broke fourth.\\" Villepigue enlisted in the Confederate States Army on March 3, 1862, at Tallahassee, joined Robert Howard Gamble's Artillery. In April 1862, he was appointed first lieutenant of the Leon Light Artillery under Gamble, then a captain. Villepigue was promoted from lieutenant to captain of the Kilcrease Light Artillery on May 26, 1863. He served with the Kilcrease Light Artillery until November 22, 1864, when he resigned his commission to become Secretary of the Confederate Senate.  Later life  On January 22, 1867, he began to serve as a judge of the criminal court in Monticello, Florida until the next session Florida Legislature, and was paid an annual salary of $200 and $5 for each case tried. 1867 tax records show Villepigue owned assessed at $700 and one horse valued at $50, while records two years later show him as a lawyer worth $10. The 1870 Census listed Villepigue as having a personnel estate of $300. He is interred at Roselawn Cemetery in Monticello, Florida.

When the eponymous character, an online sex worker or \\"cam whore\\", disappears, two mismatched travelling companions leave Belfast for Romania to find her. The story addresses the abnormality of the underworld relationship between the post-communist east and capitalist west within Europe in the 21st century. It has been described as an exploration of \\"Ceau≈üescu's regime via allegory.\\"  Plot summary  Henry Sender discovers that a website he has inherited is an outlet for eastern European webcam operatives, selling themselves live online to customers around the world. As he begins to explore his potentially new career as a webmaster, he \\"meets\\" one of his clients, Alina, who rents time on the portal and has a string of disconcerting customers. As an email relationship builds, she suddenly stops communicating and no longer appears online. She had told Henry earlier that she was planning to meet one of her customers in real life. Suffering from a bipolar disorder and bouts of paranoia, timid Henry hires a bodyguard, Shuff Sheridan, to travel with him to Romania in order to track down Alina. As Sheridan loosens up along the way, he begins to engineer violent episodes as the men travel from Belfast to London, and from Bucharest to Ia≈üi. Hard drinking Sheridan picks violent fights with random strangers while consistently consoling a panic stricken Henry by telling him that he is his Protector. Meanwhile, Alina meets her customer, Gadaka, in the flesh and he takes her to an apartment he has hired in the city of Ia≈üi. He explains that he will pay her the large and agreed sum, but that she will have to be his sex slave for eight days. As Alina begins what she hopes will be her final sordid encounter, it appears that Sheridan and Sender simultaneously embark on a night out in the same town during which a Russian mafia enforcer is killed. Back home in Belfast, elderly Francis Cleary is dying while locked inside a steel box. Unable to escape, he thinks back on his times as a maverick philosophy lecturer and how Sheridan was his most eager student. After escaping a brutal confrontation in Ia≈üi, Sheridan and Sender make it to Alina's home address. They find her hanging, having committed suicide some days before. An unsent file on her computer reveals that she had wanted to send a suicide note to Henry. The message suggests that Alina had been unable to live with the shame after what she had been through. Gadaka had cheated her out of the money he had promised to give her. While searching through her PC, Henry finds that Gadaka is trying to communicate with him. Gadaka outlines what he had done to Alina as he watches Henry seated beside her corpse on Alina's webcam. As their conversation tumbles into depravity, Henry tricks Gadaka out of a fortune in minute-per- minute webcam fees before challenging Sheridan, who has just returned, bloodied, from another bar. As Henry learns news of the now deceased Francis' fate back home, and that Sheridan is wanted for imprisoning the old man in an empty oil tank, he comes close to shooting his bodyguard. Ultimately he allows Sheridan to sleep, instead choosing to carry Alina to an historic nearby cathedral. He leaves her at the feet of St Paraskevi, Protector of Ia≈üi. Henry leaves Romania soon after, resolute that he has been somewhere close to Hell and that he must begin an escape from his past personality and his recent life. As Sheridan awakes and makes his way back home, he is arrested in London and imprisoned for life for the murder of philosopher Francis Cleary.  Reaction  Alina received a mixed reception, with critics tending to either rate it highly or dismiss it altogether. The UK's Independent on Sunday said it was \\"ambitious but flawed\\" American author and critic Frank Sennett said Alina \\"delivers a climax as harrowing as one might hope to find in contemporary crime fiction.\\"  Other work  *Woundlicker, by Jason Johnson  References   External links  *Jason Johnson website *Blackstaff Press Category:2006 novels Category:Novels set in Romania ","title":"Alina (novel)"},{"id":"20117426","text":"Anowa is a play by Ghanaian playwright Ama Ata Aidoo published in 1970. It is based on a traditional Ghanaian tale of a daughter who rejects suitors proposed by her parents; Osam and Badua, and marries a stranger who ultimately is revealed as the Devil in disguise. The play is set in the 1870s on the Gold Coast, and tells the story of the heroine Anowa's failed marriage to the slave trader Kofi Ako. The play has a unique trait where a couple, an old man and an old woman, play the role of the Chorus. They present themselves at crucial points in the play and give their own views on the events in the play. Anowa's attitude of being a modern independent woman angers Kofi Ako. He requests her to be like other normal women. Anowa lives in a hallucinated world and the sorrow of not bearing a child depresses her. Her rich husband, now frustrated with his wife asks her to leave him. Anowa argues with him and finds out that he had lost his ability to bear children and the fault was in him and not in her. This disclosure of the truth drives Kofi Ako to shoot himself and Anowa drowns herself. Anowa represents the modern woman who likes to make her own decisions and live life as per her choice. An additional conflict is that although a tribal woman, she has the traits of a city-bred. Her attitude leads to her destruction.

Original band members were Warren Lamond on vocals, Ed Wreckage on guitar, Jim Shoebridge on guitar, Glenn Smith on bass guitar and Graeme ‚ÄòHutch‚Äô Hutchinson on drums.(1987) Album notes for At The Solicitor's Request, (insert) Rubber Records. Constant members of the original band (1976-1979) were Lamond and Smith, whilst other members were replaced at various times by a host of others including Michael Hiron, Johnny 'Burnaway' Gorman, Mal ' Malcontent' Skewis, David 'Dodo'Donald and Ed Wreckage's son, Ch√© Wreckage, who joined the group in 2012 along with Michael Gilmore. The group existed from 1976 to 1979 with reformations in 1983 and 2012. According to music historian, Ian McFarlane, Brisbane produced \\"some of the most anarchistic bands of the Australian punk rock era\\" and that it was a city nationally renowned for its ultra conservatism. Ian McFarlane also mentioned the group's first and only single, which was released in 1979 and rates it as \\"one of the classics of the late 1970s Australian punk rock era.\\" The Leftovers had acquired local cult punk hero status in Australia over the years due to their acknowledged reputation in the past for excessive anti social practices, constant harassment by the Queensland Police Force and self- destructive deeds. Their musical style fitted the generic conventions of punk but they also paid live homage to earlier proto‚Äìpunk influences such as Lou Reed and Patti Smith.  History  Originally from Sandgate, Queensland, the band mostly played self-promoted hall shows. Like The Saints, they encountered at these hall venues the disproportionate attention of the law. \\"Many Leftover gigs were never finished ‚Äì police would often pull the plug before they had a chance to get through a full set\\",(2003) Album notes for The Fucken Leftovers Hate You by The Leftovers, p. 12.

Chris Spencer, compiler for the Who's Who of Australian Rock, commented that they \\"Embodied the image of what Brisbane's visualization of 'punk' was all about. Raw, energetic and anti social and everything else that made the era fun, they captured the attention of fans, neighbours and the police.;Who's Who of Australian Rock, p. 438 The band released one seven-inch E.P. in 1979. The A-side, \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\" is considered an Australian punk \\"classic.\\" The band started out with members Warren Lamond on vocals, Jim Shoebridge on guitar, Glenn Smith on bass and Graeme ‚ÄòHutch‚Äô Hutchinson on drums but also had a plethora of other musicians filling in vacant roles. They included at various times Michael Hiron on drums, Johnny 'Burnaway' Gorman on guitar and Ed Wreckage, firstly on drums and then guitar. Some of these members went on to join The Riptides and The Pineapples from the Dawn of Time at various times. The group disbanded in 1979, Lamond and Wreckage going on to form the Temporary Ornaments. After the split, according to Ian McFarlane, a string of tragedies occurred from the band's ex-members that included suicide attempts (Warren Lamond), prison (Ed Wreckage) and premature deaths. The group members who have died since are Warren Lamond, Glenn Smith, Michael Hiron, Johnny 'Burnaway' Gorman and Jim Shoebridge. In 1985, they reformed for one live show featuring Warren Lamond on vocals, Ed Wreckage on guitar, Michael Hiron on bass and David Donald on drums. In 2012, the band reformed for a show called \\"Return to White Chairs\\", which featured various other local bands from the late 1970s to early 1980s. The Leftovers' line-up for this show was Ed Wreckage on guitar, Graeme Hutchinson on percussion, Michael Gilmore on vocals and Ch√© Wreckage on bass. The current line-up have continued playing live shows in Brisbane. Legacy In 2003 a retrospective CD of Leftovers was released called The Fucken Leftovers Hate You was released by Dropkick Records as well as a re-issue of their 1979 vinyl record. The material on the CD included recorded songs including Patti Smith‚Äôs Hermine and a collection of live recordings.

Early life Calvert was born in London on 28 February 1828, and educated at King's College School. After leaving, he spent some time in the office of a London solicitor and in a mercer's business in St. Paul's Churchyard; but before long he was drawn to the stage, having derived a first impulse towards it from the plays of Shakespeare produced at Sadler's Wells Theatre by Samuel Phelps, from whom Calvert afterwards modestly declared that he had learnt all his art. Acting career He first acted professionally in 1852, at Weymouth Theatre, under the management of Edward Askew Sothern, famous for creating the role of Lord Dundreary. Then he played leading parts at Southampton and in South Wales, until in about 1855 he joined the company of Messrs. Shepherd and Creswick at the Surrey Theatre in London, where he played leading youthful parts of a \\"legitimate\\" type. A year after his arrival in London he married the actress Adelaide Ellen Biddies, who went on to continue her stage success in her own right as Adelaide Calvert. They had eight children, of whom five (three sons and two daughters) followed their parents' profession, including Louis Calvert, their third son.Richard Foulkes, ‚ÄòCalvert, Charles Alexander (1828‚Äì1879)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 8 May 2017 In 1859, Calvert became stage-manager and principal actor of the Theatre Royal, Manchester. Five years later in 1864, by then manager of the newly built Prince's Theatre, Calvert began the series of Shakespearean \\"revivals\\" which were the chief efforts of his professional life. Convinced that Shakespeare could be \\"made to pay,\\" he consistently produced plays with elaborate attention to scenery, costume, and every other element of stage effect. The Shakespearean plays revived by Calvert were the following: *The Tempest (1864), with which the Prince's Theatre opened, and which proved a signal success *Antony and Cleopatra (1866) *The Winter's Tale (1869) *Richard III (1870) *The Merchant of Venice, with Arthur Sullivan's music (1871) *Henry V (1872) *Twelfth Night (1873) *Henry IV, part 2 (1874) From a draft in his handwriting it appears to have been his intention, had his connection with the Prince's Theatre continued, to crown the series by an arrangement of the three parts of Henry VI together with Richard III in three plays, under the title of The Houses of York and Lancaster. Some of Calvert's less elaborate productions included Byron's Manfred (1867) and other plays by Shakespeare. He generally had a good \\"stock\\" company, in which several actors and actresses of mark received their training. The financial viability of the ventures he was associated with seems to have varied. The Prince's Theatre passed into the hands of a company in 1868 who quickly rebuilt it, allowing Calvert to fulfill his promise of providing \\"dramatic entertainment of the highest class\\". His connection with the theatre ended in 1875, shortly before which Calvert had staged a very successful production of Henry V in New York. After leaving the Prince's Theatre he produced, at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, Henry VIII in 1877. He also staged Byron's Sardanapalus at Liverpool and at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, and superintended a \\"replica\\" at Booth's Theatre in New York. Later years His last years were migratory, spent at the head of a traveling company which appeared in Manchester and at other places. Towards the end the state of his health, which had given way four years previously, persuaded him to retire to Hammersmith, London where he died on 12 June 1879. The genuine admiration felt for him in Manchester had been shown on the occasion of his first departure for New York by a public banquet (4 January 1875). His funeral at Brooklands cemetery, near Sale in Cheshire, was made the occasion of a popular demonstration. Later in the year (1 and 2 October) a benefit performance of As You Like It was staged in Manchester for his family.

Trained as a glazier, Heidmann joined the Rhenish Missionary Society in 1861. As a member of this group, he began work as a missionary in Cape Colony in 1865. A few years later, along with approximately 90 Baster families, he relocated to the deserted village of Rehoboth. At Rehoboth he would serve his congregation until his retirement in 1906. During warfare between the Ovaherero and the Namaqua, Heidmann acted as mediator at peace talks between the Basters and Ovaherero, and in the early 1890s he worked closely with German authorities to secure Baster cooperation against Namaqua leader Hendrik Witbooi (1825-1905). In 1886, he was visited by Swiss botanist Hans Schinz (1858-1941), with whom Heidmann agreed to collect and ship botanical specimens from German Southwest Africa to Zurich. Schinz would later name the plant species Crotalaria heidmannii after him. Heidmann suffered from dementia later in life, and died in a mental institution near Cape Town.

As in the case of Fort Hunter, the settlers about Manada Gap had already commenced a place of defense in the latter part of the fall of 1755. In February 1756, Captain Frederick Smith, with his company of provincials, either completed the fort already commenced or erected a new one. This was called Manada Fort. It was the ordinary block-house surrounded by a stockade. It stood on what is now the property of William Rhoads, east of the Manada Creek, about midway between it and the road to Jonestown, Pennsylvania and three-quarters of a mile south of the mill in Manada Gap. On the historical map it is located on the wrong side of the stream and rather too close to the mountain. Being of minor importance, or at least so considered, it was used only a couple of years.

The new system uses the terms \\"High Priority,\\" \\"Intermediate,\\" and \\"Basic\\"‚Äîwhich better defines violation information for operators and consumers, making the process easier to understand. High Priority food service violations are those that could contribute directly to a foodborne illness or injury. High Priority lodging violations are those that could pose a direct or significant threat to the public health, safety, or welfare. Intermediate food service violations are those that, if not addressed, could lead to risk factors that contribute to foodborne illness or injury. Intermediate lodging violations relate to specific actions, equipment, or procedures that contribute to a high priority violation if left unaddressed. Basic violations are those considered best practices. To download a complete copy of the new food service violation classifications, click here.

Florida Building Codes and Standards The Florida Building Commission was transferred to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation on July 1, 2011. Prior to that, the Commission was housed under the Department of Community Affairs. The Florida Building Commission (Sections 553.76 and 553.77, F.S.) is a 25-member technical body responsible for the development, maintenance and interpretation of the Florida Building Code through a consensus-building process. The Chair is appointed by the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate, and serves at the pleasure of the Governor. Other Commission members appointed by the Governor represent architects, engineers, contractors, building owners, insurance, public education, local governments, building and fire officials and persons with disabilities. The Commission also approves products for statewide acceptance and administers the Building Code Training Program. The Florida Building Code (Section 553.73, F.S.) replaced Florida's patchwork of codes and regulations that were developed, amended, administered and enforced by more than 400 local jurisdictions and state agencies with building code regulation responsibilities. The current Code is a single statewide code based on national model codes and consensus standards, amended for Florida specific needs for the design and construction of buildings. The Code is designed to make the local building process more efficient, increase accountability, bring new and safer products to the market, increase consumer confidence, and better protect the residents of this natural-disaster prone state.

Division of Drugs, Devices and Cosmetics The Division of Drugs, Devices and Cosmetics was transferred to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation on October 1, 2011. Prior to that, the Division was housed under the Department of Health. The Division of Drugs, Devices and Cosmetics safeguards the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the state of Florida from injury due to the use of adulterated, contaminated, misbranded drugs, drug ingredients and cosmetics by administering the provisions of the Florida Drug and Cosmetic Act (Chapter 499, F.S.). The Program carries out its responsibilities through three bureaus: Compliance & Enforcement, Licensing and Legal. The Division administratively supports the Cancer Drug Donation Program (CDDP). The CDDP was created during the 2006 Legislative Session with the passage of House Bill 371, which was sponsored by Representative Gayle Harrell. The purpose of the CDDP is to provide access to the drugs and supplies used to treat cancer to patients who are uninsured and do not qualify for Medicare, third-party insurance or any other state or federal programs. Section 499.029, F.S., authorizes the donation of cancer drugs and supplies by any person or entity to a participant facility for re-dispensing to an eligible recipient. For more information on the Division of Drugs, Devices and Cosmetics, visit here.  Unlicensed Activity and Enforcement  Operating as an uncertified or unregistered business in Florida is a misdemeanor crime. When the Department of Business and Professional Regulation learns of businesses operating without a license, it is required by law to forward those cases to the local State Attorney for prosecution. During a declared state of emergency, such as in the event of a hurricane or other natural disaster, the penalty for unlicensed activity is elevated from a misdemeanor to a third-degree felony. Because of the heightened penalty, those seeking to follow up on reported unlicensed businesses may wish to check with the State Attorney's office regarding any cases they may be pursuing.

Cai began his career in Fujian province. He has served successively as the mayor of Sanming, the mayor of Quzhou, the Communist Party Secretary of Taizhou, Zhejiang, and mayor of Hangzhou. Beginning in 2010 he served as the Executive Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province, and in 2014 was transferred to Beijing to serve as deputy director of the General Office serving the National Security Commission (rank equivalent of minister).http://www.chinavitae.com/biography/Cai_Qi5056 name=Cai Largely due to Cai's extensive experience working in Zhejiang province, he is believed to be a political ally of Party General Secretary Xi Jinping. Cai was also known for his extensive use of social media and his unorthodox approach to governance. Cai has referred to Xi as \\"Xi Dada\\" (father) and \\"Boss Xi!\\" in public media. The Economist opined in 2017 as Cai \\"rocketed up the Communist Party‚Äôs ranks\\" that \\"Xi Jinping has chosen an unusual man to lead the capital city.\\" Cai is said to have been a fan of Kevin Spacey's House of Cards TV serial, and was cited as a fan of the iPhone product. Biography =Early years= Cai was born in Youxi County, Fujian province in December 5, 1955. During the latter years of the Cultural Revolution he worked at a rural commune. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1975. Cai attended Fujian Normal University and graduated in 1978 with a degree in political economics. =Fujian years= In the 1980s, Cai served in the General Office of the provincial party organization in Fujian province, gaining a series of rapid promotions. He worked as deputy chief of staff serving provincial leaders, including as secretary to the provincial party chief. Between 1994 and 1997, he pursued a master's degree in law at his alma mater. In September 1996 Cai took on his first major role in local government as the deputy Party secretary and later mayor of the city of Sanming in Fujian province. He was transferred to Zhejiang in May 1999 serving as the deputy Party Secretary and Mayor of Quzhou. Between March 2002 and April 2004 Cai served as Quzhou's party secretary, the top political office of the city. In April 2004 Cai became party chief of Taizhou, Zhejiang; at the time, Xi Jinping was the party chief of Zhejiang province. In April 2007, Cai was promoted to the position Mayor of Hangzhou, the provincial capital, also serving as deputy Party Secretary. In January 2010, he became a member of the provincial Party Standing Committee as head of the party's provincial Organization Department. In November 2013, Cai became the Executive Vice Governor of Zhejiang province. He made the announcement of his change in jobs on his microblog account. Cai has a doctoral degree in political economics which he obtained from 1999.09 to 2001.07 at Fujian Normal University. =Beijing years= In March 2014, Cai was said to have been transferred to Beijing to work as the deputy General Office chief of the National Security Commission, a body led by party General Secretary Xi Jinping, though no official announcement was made about this appointment. Given his Zhejiang work experience and his current position and seniority, Cai has been named as a member of the so-called \\"New Zhijiang Army\\", i.e., officials who at one point worked under Xi Jinping during his term as Zhejiang party chief. After his transfer to Beijing, Cai stopped updating his various social media accounts. The only indication of his whereabouts appeared in news footage at numerous \\"study sessions\\" of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, where he was shown seated next to other minister-level officials, suggesting that he was an official of full provincial-ministerial rank and working for the central party organization. It was later confirmed that he was serving as Deputy Director of the Office of the National Security Commission. On 31 October 2016, Cai was appointed acting mayor of Beijing, replacing Wang Anshun; he was confirmed in January 2017. In May 2017, Cai Qi was appointed party secretary of Beijing. Cai's appointment broke nearly all conventions in post-Cultural Revolution political tradition: he was neither a member nor alternate member of the Central Committee, and took on an office that would, under normal circumstances, be accorded Politburo membership. The move assured him a Politburo seat at the 19th Party Congress. In June 2017 Cai was appointed President of the Beijing Organising Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. In June 2020, Cai was appointed to lead the team charged with the elimination of coronavirus in the Xinfadi market. Social media Cai maintains a Weibo microblog account under the subtitle \\"Cai Qi, a Bolshevik\\", which has been active since May 2010. The account was initially opened under the name Qianshui (ÊΩúÊ∞¥; literally, \\"scuba diving\\"), but he was eventually 'outed' by internet users. The account is 'followed' by over ten million people. He used it regularly to communicate with ordinary internet users. As a sub-provincial-level official Cai was one of the highest-ranking officials to maintain a regular social media presence, though he has not updated his Weibo feed since being called to work in Beijing. It is the opinion of certain political scholars that Cai used this Weibo tool to circumvent existing CCP apparatus and thereby gain public profile, \\"considerable influence\\" within the CCP and thereby promotion. Cai has stated of the CCP that: During the 2012 National People's Congress, an incident occurred in which vicious dogs allegedly belonging to a state agency were said to be injuring people. After seeing news of the incident reported online, Cai immediately called the agency in question to ask for an explanation, then posted the results of his discussion on his microblog feed. Cai's role in resolving the issue earned him accolades online. On the evening of September 14, 2013, a mother of an ordinary government staffer working for the national revenue agency posted on her microblog feed that her son was expected to partake in heavy drinking with superiors on a regular basis as part of his work and that it was affecting his health. The mother pleaded for attention to the case by then Zhejiang party organization chief Cai Qi. A day later Cai responded to her asking which department her son worked at and vowed publicly \\"your son doesn't have to drink from now on.\\"  References  Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sanming Category:Mayors of Hangzhou Category:Mayors of Beijing Category:Political office-holders in Fujian Category:Members of the 19th Politburo of the Communist Party of China Category:Fujian Normal University alumni Category:Presidents of the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games Category:Delegates to the 13th National People's Congress Category:Delegates to the 11th National People's Congress Category:Delegates to the 9th National People's Congress ","title":"Cai Qi"},{"id":"20117848","text":"Robson da Silva Ourique also known as Robson Carioca (born 6 September 1975 in Rio de Janeiro) is a retired Brazilian professional footballer who played for Trabzonspor and Elazƒ±ƒüspor in the Turkish Super Lig.

Pyocyanin is a blue, secondary metabolite with the ability to oxidise and reduce other molecules and therefore kill microbes competing against P. aeruginosa as well as mammalian cells of the lungs which P. aeruginosa has infected during cystic fibrosis. Since pyocyanin is a zwitterion at blood pH, it is easily able to cross the cell membrane. There are three different states in which pyocyanin can exist: oxidized, monovalently reduced or divalently reduced. Mitochondria play an important role in the cycling of pyocyanin between its redox states. Due to its redox-active properties, pyocyanin generates reactive oxygen species.  Synthesis  In order for pyocyanin to be synthesized by P. aeruginosa, two specific genes must be functional. MvfR is a gene which produces a transcription factor which activates phnAB genes. These genes produce the molecule quinolone which then regulates operons 1 and 2 of phzRABCDEFG which are key to the synthesis of phenazine. The synthesis of pyocyanin is primarily controlled by the quorum sensing process. P.aeruginosa strains which are unable to synthesise pyocyanin can still benefit from its effects if the strain has co-infected the lung with wild-type strains which can produce pyocyanin. Biosynthesis can be impaired by disrupting the aro pathway which is responsible for the synthesis of chorismic acid from shikimate. Chorismic acid is the precursor of pyocyanin. :shikimic acid ‚Üí chorismic acid ‚Üí phenazine-1-carboxylic acid ‚Üí 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid betaine ‚Üí pyocyanin The complete virulence of P. aeruginosa can only be experienced when pyocyanin is produced.  Redox warfare  Pyocyanin inactivates catalase by reducing its gene‚Äôs transcription as well as directly targeting the enzyme itself. Glutathione is an important antioxidant modulated by pyocyanin. In particular the pool of the reduced form is depleted while the oxidised form is promoted by hydrogen peroxide which is not dismutated by catalase. In the cystic fibrosis lung, intracellular pyocyanin converts molecular oxygen to the superoxide free radical by oxidizing NADPH to NADP+. This has a doubly negative effect on the lungs. Firstly, the NADPH used by pyocyanin depletes the available substrate for the reaction catalysed by the NADPH oxidase enzyme. Secondly, the superoxide radical generated can inhibit cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-13 and IFN-Œ≥, which usually upregulate NADPH oxidase. When the lung is confronted with pyocyanin, an increased concentration of catalase and superoxide dismutase is seen in order to deal with the barrage of radicals being produced.  Targets  Pyocyanin is able to target a wide range of cellular components and pathways. Pathways which are affected by pyocyanin include the electron transport chain, vesicular transport, and cell growth. An enhanced susceptibility to pyocyanin is seen in cells which have mutation in certain proteins or complexes. Mutations in genes affecting V-ATPase synthesis and assembly, vesicle transport machinery, and protein sorting machinery all confer an increased sensitivity to pyocyanin which further enhances the effects on cystic fibrosis on the patient. Vacuolar- ATPase in yeast cells is a particularly potent target as it is the main non-mitochondrial producer of ATP but also has numerous other functions such as calcium homeostatic control, the facilitation of receptor-mediated endocytosis and the degradation of proteins. Therefore, the inactivation of vacuolar-ATPase by hydrogen peroxide produced by pyocyanin has huge consequences for the lung. Additional to these effects, another target of pyocyanin is caspase 3-like proteases which can then go on to initiate apoptosis and necrosis. Mitochondrial electron carriers ubiquinone and nicotinic acid are also susceptible to pyocyanin. The cell cycle can be disturbed by the action of pyocyanin, and it can hinder the proliferation of lymphocytes. This is done by the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, which cause oxidative stress by directly damaging DNA or by targeting other constituents of the cell cycle such as DNA recombination and repair machinery. Pyocyanin contributes to the disproportion of protease and antiprotease activity by disabling Œ±1\\\\- protease inhibitor.  Cystic fibrosis  Many studies have concluded that pyocyanin has a derogatory effect in cystic fibrosis which enables P. aeruginosa to persist in the cystic fibrosis lung; it is often detected in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients. Pyocyanin in vitro has the ability to interfere with functions such as ciliary beating and therefore cause epithelial dysfunction as the ciliary are needed to sweep mucus up the throat. Additionally, neutrophil apoptosis, immunoglobulin release from B-lymphocytes, and interleukin release (e.g. IL-8 and CCL5) are all impaired by pyocyanin, weakening the immune system of the lung. In vivo studies have shown that the growth of fungus is inhibited in the presence of pyocyanin. The fungicidal mechanism is the activation of NAD(P)H to induce a redox-active cascade producing reactive oxygen intermediates. This allows P. aeruginosa to have a competitive advantage as it may dominate over other microorganisms in the cystic fibrosis lung. The intracellular concentration of ATP is also diminished by pyocyanin causing further damage to CFTR which are already impaired in cystic fibrosis. CFTR channels rely on ATP for two main purposes. Firstly, the binding and hydrolysis of ATP has to occur at two nucleotide binding domains for the channel to move between its open and closed conformation. Secondly, phosphorylation of CFTR by Protein kinase A II should occur in order for the channel to be operational. PKA II is activated by cAMP which is produced from ATP. Both these processes are impaired when ATP is depleted by pyocyanin.  Defence against pyocyanin  Caenorhabditis elegans possesses two specific ABC transporters called pgp-1 and pgp-2 which are effectively able to extrude intracellular pyocyanin in an energy dependent manner. Biosynthesis Biosynthesis of pyocyanin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hydrogens abstracted during next enzymatic step colored red. Pyocyanin biosynthesis begins with the synthesis of the phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) core. In this reaction the enzyme PhzE catalyzes the loss of the hydroxyl group from C4 of Chorismic Acid as well as the transfer of an amine group from glutamine to form glutamic acid and 2-amino-2-desoxyisochorismic acid (ADIC). Following this, PhzD catalyzes the hydrolytic removal the pyruvate moiety from ADIC to form (5S,6S)-6-amino-5-hydroxy-1,3-cyclohexadieve-1-carboxylic acid (DHHA). In the next step, PhzF catalyzes two steps: the abstraction of a hydrogen from C3 of DHHA, delocalization of the double bond system and reprotonation at C1 as well as enol tautomerization to form the highly unstable 6-amino-5-oxocyclohex-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid (AOCHC). From here two molecules of AOCHC are condensed by PhzB to form the tricyclic compound, hexahydrophenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid (HHPDC). The product of this reaction, HHPDC, is unstable and spontaneously undergoes oxidative decarboxylation in an uncatalyzed reaction to form tetrahydrophenazine-1,6-carboxylic acid (THPCA). In the final step of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid synthesis the enzyme PhzG catalyzes the oxidation of THPCA to dihydro-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid. This is the last catalyzed step in the production of PCA, the last step is an uncatalyzed oxidation of DHPCA to PCA. The conversion of PCA to Pyocyanin is achieved in two enzymatic steps: firstly, PCA is methylated on N5 to 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylate betaine by the enzyme PhzM using the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine and secondly, PhzS catalyzes the hydroxylative decarboxylation of this substrate to form the final product, Pyocyanin.

Its approximately 4,000 members consist of van lines, their agents, independent movers, forwarders, industry suppliers, and certain individuals and organizations (AMSA does not represent the self- storage industry). AMSA administers the industry‚Äôs ProMover quality certification program, aimed at consumers. It offers its members professional training and certification and provides them with federal government representation, statistical industry reporting, arbitration services for loss or damage claims, safety and compliance guidance, federal government rate filing, professional conferences, public relations, publications, and annual safety and quality awards. It publishes a bimonthly magazine, Direction, and a quarterly data summary, Industry Trends. Based in Alexandria, Virginia, AMSA is affiliated with 27 state moving associations and several international moving associations. Its Moving & Storage Institute, founded in 2001, sponsors industry research and scholarships.  History  AMSA is the result of three predecessors merging over time: the National Moving & Storage Association (NMSA), the American Movers Conference (AMC), and the Household Goods Carriers‚Äô Bureau (HGCB). The NMSA, the first national U.S. trade association for movers, was founded on Mackinac Island, Michigan in 1920 as the National Furniture Warehousemen‚Äôs Association and later became headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. In 1935, the Household Goods Movers‚Äô Group of the American Trucking Association was formed as a separate trade organization, changing its name in 1962 to the American Movers Conference. The HGCB was established in 1936 to help carriers comply with the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. In 1994, the AMC and the HGCB merged; and in 1998, the AMC and the NMSA merged to form American Moving & Storage Association. Membership Member companies include local, national and international firms and their suppliers offering moving and associated storage services for households and businesses; crating and transportation for sensitive freight including trade show displays, electronics, scientific and medical equipment, privately owned automobiles, fine art, and equipment for college and professional sports teams; and increasingly, portable on-demand storage and records storage and management. Specialized services may include climate-controlled storage for items such as furs, wine, film, rugs, art, magnetic tape, and documents. Many AMSA members engage in supply chain warehousing. Members also handle national and international employee relocation and personal property moves for the private sector and U.S. government agencies such as the State Department (through the General Services Administration) as well as for active duty U.S. military personnel (Department of Defense business represents the industry's largest single customer). AMSA hosted GSA's Household Goods and Freight Forum at its annual conference from 2008 to 2012. Members engaged in moving must abide by an ethical code of conduct and comply with state, or for interstate moves, federal transportation safety and consumer protection regulations. Membership is also open to industry affiliates (companies which provide specialized services or products, work collaboratively with industry businesses, use industry services, or whose own clientele is involved in or impacted by the move process); individuals (industry employees, van operators, and others whose work is impacted by the moving and storage sector); and professional and trade associations, including state, regional, national and international moving associations and related industry professional organizations. ProMover program =Interstate moves= In January 2008, to help consumers avoid unscrupulous or illegitimate movers (many proliferating on the Internet), AMSA created the ProMover certification program for its members that have federal interstate operating authority. Such members must pass an annual criminal background check, be licensed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and agree to abide by ethical standards such as honesty in advertising and in business transactions with customers. Each ProMover also signs a contract to commit to adhere to applicable Surface Transportation Board and FMSCA regulations. AMSA also examines company ownership and registration with state corporation commissions, and the mover must maintain at least a satisfactory rating with the Better Business Bureau. Those that pass are authorized to display the ProMover logo on their websites and in marketing materials; those that fail are expelled from the program (and from AMSA) if they cannot correct discrepancies during a probationary period. =Intrastate moves= In October 2010, AMSA began a two-year pilot program with the California Moving & Storage Association, the first time ProMover certification was made available to qualified movers operating only within a state. The program has since become permanent. In April 2012, intrastate movers in Michigan became eligible; and the Florida ProMover program began in February 2013.

Vendor at West Side Park  Pieper (pronounced \\"Piper\\") was born February 17, 1886 in Hanover, Germany. His family, including ten siblings, settled in Denver, Colorado. In 1904, 17-year-old Pat left for Chicago in search of a career. He was hired as a popcorn and peanut vendor by Dan Ryan, Sr., then the concessions boss at West Side Park, the home field of the Cubs. He later recalled that Ryan told him that \\"the first fifty years are the toughest. After that, it's easy.\\"Canton, Ray, \\"Pat Pieper of the Cubs: For 49 Years He Has Been as Much a Part of ...,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune; Aug 30, 1953; p. D7. By 1916, the Cubs had moved into Weeghman Park, soon to become known as Wrigley Field. The team did not bring along their field announcer, and Pieper talked himself into the job with Cub President Charles Weeghman.Husar, John, \\"Cub field announcer Pieper dead at 88: Pat Pieper dead at 88,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune; Oct 23, 1974; p. E1. Pieper also worked in the World Series of 1918, wherein the Cubs used Comiskey Park as home due to its greater capacity. There, he had the unusual task of announcing a pinch hitter for Babe Ruth, who was then a young pitcher for the Boston Red Sox.Condon, David, \\"In the Wake of the News,\\" Chicago Tribune; Jul 15, 1969; pg. C1. \\"The Babe,\\" says Pieper, \\"was always tough for my Cubs.\\"Canton, 1953.  The Voice of Wrigley Field  Pieper first got to use an electronic public address system in 1932. \\"That saved my life,\\" he said. \\"Before that, I had to run up and down the lines with my [14-pound] megaphone to make any kind of announcement. On some of those hot Wrigley Field days I‚Äôd lose six or eight pounds.\\"Husar, 1974 As field announcer, he proclaimed the lineups, the current batter, defensive changes and so forth. He also introduced special guests and announced special events, such as births within the Cub \\"family.\\"Langford, George, \\"Pittsburgh Rips Cubs Again 5-2\\", Chicago Tribune; Sep 15, 1972; p. C1. On September 25, 1963, the retiring Stan Musial was named a Vice President of the St. Louis Cardinals just before he came to bat in the third inning at Wrigley. The next time that Musial batted, Pieper announced him with his new title. The Vice President struck out, then left the game for City Hall to be made an honorary citizen of Chicago.\\"Musial Fans as Executive in Third Inning: Cards Name The Man Vice President,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune; Sep 26, 1963; p. E5 Pieper's signature phrase at the beginning of each game was, \\"Attention! ... Attention, please! ... Have your pencil ... and scorecards ready ... and I'll give you... the correct lineup ... for today's ball game. The batt'ry ... for the [team]... [pitcher's name] ... and [catcher's name].\\" [and so on] He also would announce, \\"Play ball!\\" at the start of the game. In recent years, the Cubs have played a recording of that phrase to announce the starting lineups. Between Pieper and current Philadelphia Phillies' public address announcer Dan Baker, the 2016 MLB season will mark 100 consecutive seasons that one of them has been announcing games. Baker has been the Phillies' PA announcer since 1972. The last game that was played without Pieper or Baker announcing games, was the 1915 World Series on October 13, 1915.  Witness to Diamond History  Pieper missed just 16 home games during his 59 years with the Cubs, and did not miss a game from 1924 onward. Hence, he witnessed virtually all of the great moments in Wrigley Field baseball history. He believed that his favorite moment came in 1917 \\"when our big left hander, Jim (Hippo) Vaughn, and Fred Toney, a right hander for Cincinnati pitched a double no-hitter for nine innings,\\" Pieper recalled.Canton, 1953. \\"Somewhere at home I still have a picture of that great afternoon ‚Äì a photograph of Vaughn, Toney and me.\\"Condon, David, \\"In the Wake of the News\\", Chicago Tribune; Apr 12, 1967; p. E1. \\"Don‚Äôt let anybody tell you the Babe [Ruth] didn‚Äôt point to the bleachers before he slammed that homer off Charlie Root,\\" said Pieper, referring to The Called Shot of 1932. \\"I know. I had the best seat in the house ... I remember it as if it were yesterday. Guy Bush, one of our best pitchers was on the edge of the Cub dugout screaming ‚ÄòYou big so and so, he's got two strikes on you. He‚Äôll get you next time.‚Äô Ruth stepped out of the batter's box. He definitely pointed toward center field where he planted Root's next pitch.\\"Canton, 1953. Pieper was on the job when Gabby Hartnett‚Äòs Homer in the Gloamin' helped propel the Cubs to the 1938 National League pennant. \\"I have always attempted to handle my job as announcer with dignity,\\" recalled Pieper. \\"But when I saw Gabby's hit soaring on its way over the left field fence, I picked up the bag of baseballs I keep for umpires and ran to third base to meet him. Then I jogged beside him until he reached home plate. You might say I brought Gabby home. I kept shouting, 'Be sure and touch the plate.' Gabby just smiled. I never saw a man so happy. I was 52 years old then. That was no way for me to behave.\\" Husar, 1974.Burns, Edward, \\"I Was There...: Hartnett's 'Homer in the Gloaming' Sparks Cubs to '38 League Title,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune; Jan 7, 1954; p. B1 Pieper names Rogers Hornsby as the greatest all-around player he'd seen. \\"He did everything well: hit, run, field. Hornsby wasn‚Äôt a flashy player, just a great who had his head jammed with baseball knowledge. He knew every hitter in the league. He played position on ‚Äòem, and very frequently he was within six inches of where the ball was hit.\\"Condon, 1967; p. E1. Pieper regarded the Cubs infield of the 1930s, with Billy Jurges, Billy Herman and Phil Cavarretta, as more proficient than the legendary Tinker, Evers and Chance. \\"I pick them because the rabbit ball has made the job of the infielders much, much tougher than it was in 1906.\\"Canton, 1953. Pat Pieper had a small role in one of baseball history's weirdest plays. It took place during a game played on June 30, 1959, between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Stan Musial was at the plate, with a count of 3‚Äì1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, however Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, third baseman Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.Musial Is First in History Put Out By 2 Baseballs!  Personal  The Cubs honored Pieper with a \\"day\\" on September 22, 1940, celebrating 25 years as field announcer, and again on September 13, 1953, in honor of his fifty years as a Cub employee. The latter occasion took place a day before Gene Baker and Ernie Banks joined‚Äîand thus integrated‚Äîthe ballclub. In 1961, he got to throw out the first ball to open the season, after which he reported for work as customary, in his chair behind home plate, making the usual announcements and providing fresh baseballs to the plate umpire as needed. The Hall of Fame made a recording of Pieper's voice in 1966. As Wrigley Field had no lighting system until 1988, all the Cubs home games were played in the daytime. After the games, Pieper would serve as a waiter at The Ivanhoe, a castle-themed north-side Chicago restaurant that opened in 1920 and featured turrets and drawbridges, and even had an adjoining theater.Leonard, Will, \\"Chicago Visitor: Automation, by Way of Guitar, Comes to Cafes\\", Chicago Tribune; Apr 2, 1967; p. E14. Pieper met Karen Marie Jorgensen in 1910, and after what he called \\"a whirlwind courtship,\\" married her in 1918. Karen didn't like to attend baseball games, although Pieper recalls that he once got her to stay for all of three innings. Karen died in 1971. They had no children.Husar, 1974. A dedicated bowler, Pieper subbed for an absent player in the American Bowling Congress tournament in 1924. He threw three consecutive strikes before the absentee returned.\\"Pat Pieper Really Knew When to Quit,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune; Aug 26, 1962; p. M2. He was a mainstay of the Cubs‚Äô team, rolling alongside Andy Pafko, Billy Holm, Phil Cavarretta and Gabby Hartnett, often in tournaments organized by Ray Schalk.Segreti, James, \\"Spotting the Pins,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune; Dec 19, 1948; p. A2Segreti, James, \\"Spotting the Pins,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune; Dec 18, 1949; p. A5 Pieper bowled a 200 game at age 80.  Death  Pieper was taken ill after reporting for work at the ballpark on September 8, 1974. Suffering from acute jaundice, he was admitted to American Hospital, and died on October 22, 1974. In 1996, he was inducted into the Chicago Cubs Walk of Fame.

The artist currently lives and works between London and Beijing. Lu Chao's paintings are mostly filled with sketch-like portrayals of a massive number of different faces, evoking a sense of mystery and strangeness. For the artist, the unknown is sublime and he avoids using his work as a carrier for opinions, preferring to leave the door open for viewers to interpret the pieces on their own. He aim to establish an exchange between viewers and the larger universe around them by integrating an expanding world into his own labyrinth of personalized patterns. Through his works, Lu Chao exposes us to the unknown and strangeness of our life, of our world and of our state of mind. We find it difficult to truly understand our own persona, and we find it even more exhausting to comprehend the world around us. The gap between what we do and what we do not know, shapes the beauty and excitements of life. Education Background Lu Chao completed his Masters at the Painting Department of the Royal College of Art (London, UK) in 2014 and finished his Bachelor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts (Beijing, China) oil painting department in 2012.

Opened in 1988 and expanded in 1992, the mall comprises more than 100 stores, plus a food court and movie theater, in of gross leasable area. The mall also includes five anchor stores (two JCPenney stores, Macy's, Target, and Dick's Sporting Goods), as well as DSW, Old Navy, and Regal Cinemas. The mall is managed by Cafaro Company of Youngstown, Ohio. History South Hill Mall opened in 1988 in Puyallup, Washington, at the junction of Washington State Route 512 and 31st Avenue SW. At the time, the mall included only three anchors: Mervyns, Lamonts and Target. Six years later, work began on a westward expansion which added more than of new retail space, including three new anchors: JCPenney, Sears and The Bon March√©. Office Max and Old Navy were later added as well. Lamonts was converted to Gottschalks in 2000 when the Lamonts chain was acquired. The Bon March√© was dual-branded as Bon-Macy's in 2003, and then was renamed as just Macy's in 2005, the same year that Gottschalks closed most of the former Lamonts stores. Within a year of its closing, the former Gottschalks anchor was split between Circuit City and Linens 'n Things. Mervyns closed in 2006 as the chain exited Washington. By May of the same year, it was announced that Kohl's, a chain based in Wisconsin, had acquired the former Mervyns store, although the mall's manager later said that Kohl's had no plans to open a store in the mall. A multimillion-dollar renovation of the mall also began in 2009, starting with a renovation of the food court. In addition, JCPenney moved its women's departments to the former Mervyns, while retaining all other departments in the existing store. Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Washington state location in April 2010, replacing the spaces vacated by Circuit City and Linens 'n Things. On 15 October 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide.

In 2019, Vermont Electric Cooperative served about 34,000 members in 74 towns in northern Vermont, including Addison, Caledonia, Chittenden, Essex, Franklin, Grand Isle, Lamoille, and Orleans counties.  History  Vermont Electric Cooperative was founded in 1938 in Eden Mills to serve residents in parts of rural Lamoille County who had been bypassed by investor-owned utilities. The Rural Electrification Act financed most of the growth in the early years. Early service was extended into Chittenden and Franklin counties. From the 1940s until the early 1960s, the territory it served expanded in northern Vermont through the construction of new lines and the acquisition of small private companies. In 1969, Vermont Electric Cooperative expanded into southern Vermont by merging with Halifax Electric Cooperative. In 1970, Vermont Electric Cooperative acquired the International Electric Company serving Derby Line. In 2004, Vermont Electric Cooperative acquired Citizens Communications Company's Vermont Electric Division. This more than doubled the membership-base. In 2006, Vermont Electric Cooperative sold its Southern District in Windham and Windsor counties to Central Vermont Public Service (CVPS), reducing its membership by 2,770. Additionally 12 member services in 3 towns of MA were sold to Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO) In 2008, Vermont Electric Cooperative sought a 9.2% rate increase from the Vermont Public Service Board. It estimates that the rise in rates from transmission rates from ISO New England will increase its transmission costs by $1.5 million to $6 million total. About 30% of the increase is due to this increased transmission costs. In 2009, Vermont Electric Cooperative announced that it would purchase 50% of the 40 megawatts Sheffield wind-generated electricity when it becomes available. The cooperative installed smart meters at 80% of their households from 2007 to 2009. Savings using these have paid for the equipment upgrades.  Administration  A 12-member Board of Directors is elected by members. Seven seats are reserved for geographic districts. Five members are elected by the entire membership.The Chronicle, June 3, 2009, page 24, \\"VEC reorganizes its board\\", Joseph Gresser District 1 includes the towns of Averill, Avery's Gore, Barton, Bloomfield, Brighton, Brownington, Brunswick, Canaan, Charleston, Ferdinand, Guildhall, Holland, Lemington, Lewis, Lyndon, Maidstone, Morgan, Newark, Norton, Sheffield, Sutton, Warner's Grant, Warren Gore, Westmore and Wheelock. There are also towns in Caledonia County. District 2 includes Coventry, Derby, and Newport city. The remaining towns in Orleans County are in District 5. District 4 includes Jay, Lowell, Newport town, Westfield, and Troy. District 8 includes Albany, Barton, Craftsbury, Glover, Greensboro, and towns in Lamoille and Caledonia counties. The president of the Board of Directors is Dan Carswell. In 2013, there were 18 candidates for three open seats on the board.  Programs  Vermont Electric Cooperative's core mission is to supply safe, affordable, and reliable energy services to its members. VEC not only supplies electricity to members, but also offers a range of programs including bill credits for the purchase of certain electric appliances and devices including electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, heat pumps, heat pump hot water heaters, pellet stoves, electric forklifts, and Zero Energy Modular homes. In December 2016, Vermont Electric Cooperative launched Co-op Community Solar, a program under which members can sponsor solar panels in community solar arrays. Members pay an upfront payment for a term of either ten or twenty years and get a fixed monthly credit on their electric bill. Over the term, the total value of the bill credits exceeds the value of the upfront payment.

Lipton (born August 13, 1965) is a reporter at The New York Times based in the Washington Bureau. He has been a working journalist for three decades, with stints at The Washington Post and the Hartford Courant, and he is also the co-author of a history of the World Trade Center. Lipton joined The Times in 1999, covering the final years of the administration of New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, as well as the 2001 terror attacks. Since 2004, he has been based in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, where he is an investigative reporter who now writes about the Trump administration, as well as lobbying and corporate agendas in Congress. His previous assignments included the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration, as well as the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Lipton has won or participated in three Pulitzer Prizes, among numerous other journalism awards. Career and awards Prior to working for The New York Times, he spent five years each at The Washington Post, the Hartford Courant, and the first two years of his newspaper career at the Valley News in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Lipton is a 1987 graduate of the University of Vermont where he received a BA in philosophy and history. In 2017, he was part of a team of 11 reporters at The Times awarded the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for its coverage on Russia‚Äôs covert projection of power, including the story examining Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In 2015, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Journalism for a series of stories about lobbying of state attorneys general and Congress. That series of stories also was awarded the 2015 prize for large circulation newspapers by Investigative Reporters and Editors. And he was among a group of reporters that earned the 2015 Gerald Loeb Award for Beat Reporting. One of the three stories in the series about state attorneys general focused on Scott Pruitt, then the Attorney General of Oklahoma, detailing for the first time the secretive alliance Pruitt had with oil and gas companies and other energy producers. These companies were sending tens of millions of dollars to the Republican Attorneys General Association that Pruitt helped run at the same time as Pruitt was helping the companies fight Obama-era environmental regulations, by suing to block these rules in federal court at least 14 times. Lipton found that Pruitt had taken draft letters written by the energy companies, put them on his state government stationary and sent them in to officials in Washington. When Pruitt was later nominated to serve as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Trump, this story became a central focus of his confirmation hearing. In 1992, he won a Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Journalism, at the age of 26, for a series of stories he co-authored at the Hartford Courant on the Hubble Space Telescope with Robert S. Capers. The stories examined the team of scientists who built the main mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope, considered one of the most complex scientific devices at the time of its launch. Facing financial pressures and other challenges, the team built a misshapen main mirror for the space telescope, a flaw that was ultimately corrected but caused embarrassment and questions about the status of United States space science. Lipton was also a finalist in 1999 for the Livingston Award for young journalists while working as a reporter at The Washington Post, for a series of stories examining the trash industry in New York City, which then shipped most of its waste via truck to landfills in Virginia. In 2008, he was the recipient of an honorary degree from the University of Vermont.  World Trade Center coverage  Lipton spent months after the September 2001 attacks covering the aftermath of the attacks on New York, writing a series of stories for The New York Times and its \\"Nation Challenged\\" section about the efforts to recover and identify human remains from the site and to clear the World Trade Center site of the debris left after the attack. Those stories, co-written with James Glanz of The New York Times, were part of a package that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2002. A story in The New York Times Magazine he co-wrote with James Glanz, which appeared on the first anniversary of the attacks, examined the history of the trade center towers. That story was the basis for a book he would co-author with James Glanz, published in 2003, City in the Sky, the Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center, which examined the conception, design, construction, life and ultimate destruction of the twin towers, tracing the story back to the 1950s when the project was first proposed by David Rockefeller. A second story, titled \\"Fighting to Live as the Towers Died\\", examined the fate of the unlucky individuals who were stuck above the point of impact in the two towers after the planes hit, a piece based on hundreds of hours or work collecting random emails, text messages and recollections of phone calls with those victims, all of which were assembled into a single narrative. That story formed the basis of a 2004 book called 102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers, written by Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn, who were co-authors on the original New York Times story. Archival materials from the Lipton and Glanz research effort‚Äîthe most comprehensive history ever written about the World Trade Center‚Äîare now maintained at the New York Public Library. The materials are separated into five chronological categories: Conception (1945-1970), Construction (1966-1973), Life in the Towers (1972-2001), 9/11, and Post 9/11 (2001-2003) The research was also featured in an episode of the documentary series American Experience, \\"New York: The Center of the World\\".  Homeland Security  Lipton was among the first reporters to be assigned to cover the Department of Homeland Security full-time. He started shortly after it was created, writing stories that examined the challenges associated with the largest change in federal bureaucracy since Harry S. Truman was president, and chronicling the agency's struggle as it spent billions of dollars on flawed airport security screening equipment and ships for the Coast Guard. His assignment ended up taking him to disaster zones around the world, including weeks spend in Mississippi and Louisiana in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, examining flaws in the government response and waste and fraud in hurricane aid. He was also sent in December 2004 to Banda Aceh, along with a team of reporters from The New York Times, to cover the earthquake and tsunami there that killed more than 150,000.  Trump coverage  Lipton has been part of a collection of reporters at The Times who have examined the business operations of The Trump Organization as Donald J. Trump moved to the White House. He has detailed the potential for conflicts of interest, including Trump Hotel in Washington D.C. and Trump operations in the Philippines, Turkey, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Dubai, Vancouver, and other stops. He also looked at how the Trump family took steps to attempt to address some of the issues covered in these stories. Lipton has also written pieces about the arrival within the Trump administration of former lobbyists, corporate lawyers and corporate executives, like Carl Icahn, who have taken up issues with their new powers that may benefit their holdings or past business partners. His work has been featured in a number of other documentary films, including The Falling Man, by Harry Singer, and War on Whistleblowers: Free Press and the National Security State, a 2013 film examining government whistleblowers. Personal life Lipton lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife, Elham Dehbozorgi.

Public Broadcast Service owns a radio station, 91.1FM and its television programming was introduced in 2009. The station falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development. The main focus is educational programming. The radio and television station will be geared towards everyone from school children to continuous education for adults. The stated intention according to the acting Education Minister Patrick Todd, was that: \\"if Barbados wants to be competitive, there must be further reform of the educational system, to fully embrace and deploy all the technologies... in order to reach those individuals who do not respond readily to traditional teaching methods.\\" Todd added that the PBS would cater to those Barbadians, who, for one reason or another, want to re-educate themselves. \\"The PBS for Education in Barbados will have the capacity to offer certified online training courses for teachers, public officers, police officers, fire officers and the Defence Force,\\" he explained. The facility for the service will encompass a radio station, a free-to-air television station and an umbrella website. It will fall under the auspice of the Media Resource Department (Formerly the Ministry‚Äôs Audio-Visual Aids Department from the years 1969-1996) at Government Hill, will officially be in charge of overseeing the service.

South Ossetia agreement  Russia brokered a ceasefire and negotiated the Agreement in 1992. The agreement primarily established a cease-fire between both the Georgian and South Ossetian forces, but it also defined a zone of conflict around the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali and established a security corridor along the border of the as yet unrecognized South Ossetian territories. The Agreement also created a Joint Control Commission and a peacekeeping body, the Joint Peacekeeping Forces group (JPKF). The JPKF was put under Russian command and was composed of peacekeepers from Georgia, Russia, and North Ossetia (as the separatist South Ossetian government was still unrecognized; South Ossetian peacekeepers, however, served in the North Ossetian contingent). In addition, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) did agree to monitor the ceasefire and to facilitate negotiations. The OSCE sought to eliminate sources of tension, support the existing ceasefire, and facilitate a broader political framework to alleviate long term disharmony.  Abkhazia agreement  Once again, a Russian brokered agreement in 1993, the Agreement on a ceasefire in Abkhazia and On a Mechanism To Ensure Its Observance, allowed for a moratorium on the use of force, the withdrawal of conflicting parties from the warzone within fifteen days, establishing a Russian-Georgian- Abkhaz control group to monitor the ceasefire, the return of the Abkhazian parliament to Sukhumi, the placement of UN observers in the territory, and the resumption of talks to settle the dispute. In August of the same year UNOMIG was put in place as the UN monitoring force. The truce was violated on September 27 as Abkhaz forces seized Sukhumi and declared victory. The pro- Georgian forces then withdrew to Tbilisi, as Georgia joined the CIS and changed Russia's stance towards Georgia's on the matter. A further Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces, also known as the 1994 Moscow Agreement, was agreed the following year. Once again, on March 6‚Äì7, 2003, Georgian President Eduard Sheverdnadze and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed another agreement that sought to include economic rehabilitation, resumption of rail networks, and the attraction of international investment. This would happen to turn into a disappointment, especially for the Georgians.  Other Sochi summits  Then President of Russia Vladimir Putin meeting with then President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and then Prime Minister of Abkhazia Gennady Gagulia in Sochi on 7 March 2003. In 2003, Russian President Vladimir Putin met Georgian President Shevardnadze and Abkhazian PM Gennady Gagulia and set in motion a Sochi process that sought to create a Georgian- Russian-Abkhaz working groups on confidence building measures's (CBM). The parties sought to make it easier for the return of refugees and economic reconstruction. The Sochi process signified a regress from the multilateral to a bilateral format that left Georgia on its own to face Russia and the Abkhaz. It also was seen to undermine Georgia's argument that the Geneva process was the sole format for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. In 2004, Russia were seen to violate the agreement as a Russian company begun maintenance work on the Sochi-Sukhumi railroad, which was legally Georgian, though controlled by Russia and the Abkhaz. The move was seen as a violation whereby restoration could only proceed in parallel with the safe return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia beginning with the Gali district. However, there had been no progress on the return of refugees, and so, unilateral Russian actions on the railroad violated the Sochi agreement. However, there had been no progress on the return of refugees. In 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush and Putin made a last-ditch attempt as incumbent presidents to resolve a protracted dispute over European missile defenses at another Sochi summit. This followed Russian officials objecting to U.S. plans to deploy ballistic missile defenses (BMD) in Poland and the Czech Republic. They had claim that the stated American justification for the BMD deployments‚Äîthat the systems are needed to defend the United States and European countries against an emerging Iranian missile threat‚Äîlacked credibility. Instead, they insisted the true objective of such moves along Russia's periphery was to weaken Russia's nuclear deterrent.

She was built, like her twin, Blanco Encalada, in the UK in 1875. She participated in the War of the Pacific, with her most prominent action being her victory over the Peruvian monitor Hu√°scar in the Angamos naval battle. Almirante Cochrane was part of the forces that defeated President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda in the Chilean Civil War of 1891. Background In 1871 the president of Chile, Federico Err√°zuriz Za√±artu, initiated a bill in the Chilean congress to authorize the executive to purchase two armored vessels. The bill passed with only one opposing vote (that of the former president Jos√© Joaqu√≠n P√©rez Mascayano), and provided for two medium-sized ships and that the total cost of the purchase would be 2,000,000 pesos. Construction and operation The Chilean ambassador to the United Kingdom, Alberto Blest Gana, was placed in charge of the project. Blest Gana hired the British ship designer E. J. Reed, a former naval architect to the British Admiralty, as technical adviser. The order was placed at Earle's Shipbuilding Co. in Hull, Yorkshire. The central battery ships were to be named Almirante Cochrane and Valpara√≠so (Valpara√≠so was subsequently renamed Blanco Encalada). The construction of Almirante Cochrane began in April 1872. The ship was launched and sailed to Chile in 1874, before having been completed, because of fears of a potential conflict with neighboring Argentina and Bolivia. Almirante Cochrane arrived at the port of Valpara√≠so on December 26, 1874, commanded by Captain Coneyin and returned to the UK to be completed in January 1877, after her sister, Valparaiso had arrived. In January 1878, once the dispute with Argentina had been settled, President An√≠bal Pinto instructed Alberto Blest Gana to arrange for the sale of the two central battery ships in order to alleviate the economic crisis that had prevailed in Chile for several years. On behalf of Blest Gana, E. J. Reed offered Almirante Cochrane to the UK for the sum of 220,000 pounds sterling, but the British declined. Reed then tried to sell the two ships to Russia, but again without success. She was then rebuilt in 1897-1900 as a gunnery and torpedo training ship.http://www.eeldersite.com/naval/Chile.htm She was scrapped in 1934. Design =Principal dimensions= Plan view and profile Almirante Cochrane was 64.0 m long, with a beam of 14.0 m and a draft of 6.0 m. The hull had a maximum displacement of 3650 t when fully loaded with fuel, fresh water, weapons, ammunition, food and crew. The hull was constructed of iron, held with rivets, and was divided lengthwise into eight compartments (counting piques the bow and stern), by seven iron bulkheads. The bow of Almirante Cochrane had, as was customary in the designs of the late nineteenth century, a sharp spur located under the waterline and projecting ahead of the forward perpendicular. She was fitted with a cruiser stern. =Armament= Almirante Cochranes central battery The main armament, which was mounted on the central redoubt (central battery), was six 228 mm (9 in) Armstrong guns divided by three-band, mounted heal Scott central pivot, allowing the bow cannon to fire off the sleeve. The centerpiece fired at an angle of 70 degrees and 35 degrees to bow to stern and the third from the hose to the stern (see picture). Supplementing this was a 20-pounder cannon, and one 9 and one 7 pounders, and a Nordenfeldt machine gun installed in the COFA's ratchet, one-inch-caliber (25.4 mm), which fired a one-pound (454 grams) projectile. Almirante Cochrane also had a steam boat which was equipped with a torpedo on a bowsprit. The only time this boat was used was on the expedition to Callao, where she was used to try to sink Peruvian ships. =Armor= The ship was protected under the waterline by an armored belt which stretched from around under the waterline up to the battery cover. The maximum thickness was at the waterline, the center of the ship, and at the bow and stern. The hull and armor plating were separated by a layer of teak thick to reduce the impact of hits. The battery cover, which was flush with the armored belt, was protected by a armour in the center of the ship, reducing to at the bow and stern. The battery, which had a height of between 2 and 2.5 m, was protected in bands and on the front face by two plates, the lower one and the top one thick. The back of the battery was protected by armor plating thick. Like the armor of the hull, this was bolted to a metal structure with an inner lining of teak thick. =Propulsion= Almirante Cochrane was fitted with both steam and sail propulsion, being rigged as a barquentine. The power plant, provided by the company John Penn & sons, consisted of two compound steam engines, six boilers and two propellers. The machines had two horizontal cylinders, one high- and one low-pressure. The high-pressure cylinder had a diameter of 1.16 metres (46 inches) while the low-pressure cylinder had a diameter of 1.93 metres (76 inches). The race was two cylinders of . The machines were capable of a maximum total output of 1.23 MW (2,920 HP), providing 90 revolutions per minute. These two machines span propeller blades of four to in diameter and of way. The steam was supplied by six cylindrical tube boilers with a maximum working pressure of 413.6 kPa (60 psi). The total area of 836.12 sq meters of heating era (9000 ft ¬≤). This propulsion system allowed the Cochrane, during tests over a measured mile, a top speed of 12.8 knots. However, the maximum operating speed was 12 knots. At this speed fuel consumption was 45 tons of coal per day, with consumption of 35 tons per day at the reduced speed of 10 knots. Military operations =War of the Pacific (1879-1883)= Naval battle of Angamos Almirante Cochrane participated in the War of the Pacific, most prominently being taking part in the defeat and capture of Peruvian monitor Hu√°scar in the Naval Battle of Angamos, on October 8, 1879. At the start of the war Almirante Cochrane was commanded by Captain Enrique Baeza Simpson and since April 5 was present at the blockade of Iquique. At the end of June 1879 Almirante Cochrane was the flagship of the 2nd Naval Division, in charge of the blockade of Iquique with the gunboat Magellan, the corvette Abtao and Matias Cousi√±o. On July 16, Almirante Cochrane and Matias Cousi√±o were relieved by Blanco Encalada and Lamar, respectively, and withdrew to Antofagasta. In August 1879, Almirante Cochrane sailed to Valpara√≠so and underwent maintenance for the next month. Captain Juan Jos√© Latorre then took command. Latorre was also head of the 2nd Naval Division, which also consisted of Loa and O'Higgins. Almirante Cochrane then went on to participate in the decisive naval battle of Angamos. Almirante Cochrane was also present in 1880 when the Peruvian corvette Union broke the blockade of Arica. Torpedo boat attacking Almirante Cochrane =Civil War of 1891= During the 1891 Chilean Civil War Almirante Cochrane was part of the forces that defeated President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda. At dusk on January 7, 1891, Almirante Cochrane towed Hu√°scar, which had had her machines dismantled, from the Bay of Valpara√≠so to Las Salinas, where Hu√°scar was prepared for service. On August 23, 1891, she participated in the battle against the forces at Valparaiso, along with the Esmeralda and under the command of Jorge Montt. Almirante Cochrane took between 10 and 12 hits, whilst Esmeralda took between 6 and 8.

It is a hydrophobic alcohol that plays a key role in the growth of cell walls (peptidoglycan) in Gram-positive bacteria.  Occurrence  Bactoprenol is a lipid synthesized from mevalonic acid and is the most abundant lipid found in certain species of lactobacilli. Bactoprenol is found in both mesosomal and plasma membranes. Mesosomal and plasma bactoprenol are synthesized independently from each other.  Function  Bactoprenol is thought to play a key role in the formation of cell walls in gram-positive bacteria by cycling peptidoglycan monomers through the plasma membrane and inserting these monomers at points of growth in the bacterial cell wall.  Antibiotic significance  Because bactoprenol is so important for cell growth, numerous antibiotic compounds function by disrupting the bactoprenol-mediated transportation pathway.

In addition to doing work for the U.S. Government under the New Deal, and contributing a mural for the Williamsburg Housing Project in Brooklyn for the Federal Art Project, Criss taught at the leftist American Artists School in the 1930s. His pupils there included Ad Reinhardt. He also held teaching positions at numerous other institutions, including the Albright Museum School, Buffalo; the Art Students League; the New School for Social Research; and the School of Visual Arts.Tsujimoto (1982). p. 184. Criss was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1934. The work from his best-known years, the 1930s and 1940s, is characterized by imagery of the urban environment, such as elevated subway tracks, skyscrapers, streets, and bridges. Criss rendered these subjects with a streamlined, abstracted style, devoid of human figures, that led him to be associated with the Precisionism movement. With distorted perspectives and dream-like juxtapositions, as in Jefferson Market Courthouse (1935), these empty cityscapes also suggest the influence of Surrealism. A turn towards more commercial work later in his career‚Äîincluding a November 1942 cover for Fortune Magazine‚Äîled to a decline in his reputation.

Its primary purpose was to manage the internal affairs of the Qing imperial family and the activities of the inner palace (in which tasks it largely replaced eunuchs), but it also played an important role in Qing relations with Tibet and Mongolia, engaged in trading activities (jade, ginseng, salt, furs, etc.), managed textile factories in the Jiangnan region, and even published books. This department was also in charge of the ceremonial and spiritual activities of the Qing imperial household. These activities include the maintenance of the mausoleums of Qing emperors, polytheist worships and posthumous affairs of the royal family (The giving of temple names and posthumous names).Â§ßÊ∏ÖÊúÉÂÖ∏‰∫ã‰æã.ver.1899.vol.1178-96. Origins The Department was established before the Manchu-led Qing dynasty defeated the Ming dynasty in 1644, but it became mature only after 1661, following the death of the Shunzhi Emperor and the accession of his son, who reigned as the Kangxi Emperor. In 1654, the department was temporarily substituted by the Thirteen Yamen (ÂçÅ‰∏âË°ôÈñÄ) which had similar functions. In 1661, the thirteen yamen were abolished with the re-establishment of the imperial household department.Â§ßÊ∏ÖÊúÉÂÖ∏‰∫ã‰æã.ver.1899.vol.1170. Personnel The Department was manned by booi (Manchu: booi, ), or \\"bondservants\\", who were selected from the bondservants of the upper three banners. Booi was sometimes synonymous with booi aha, which literally means \\"household person\\", but aha usually referred to the heriditarily and legally servile people who worked in fields, whereas booi usually referred to household servants who performed domestic service. The booi who operated the Imperial Household Department can be divided into roughly four groups: (a) a small booi elite; b) the majority of the booi; c) indentured servants of the booi; d) the state bondservants (Manchu: sinjeku, ). In total,there were three nirus of the department consist of booi. They are Cigu Niru (Chinese niru), Solho Niru (Korean niru) and Hoise Niru (Muslim niru) respectively. The demographic composition of the department was thus diverse. Manchu, Han Chinese, Korean and Muslim were cooperating to keep the department functioning.

Brimer claims to be the first pianist to record the complete Beethoven sonatas in Australia. The series of live recitals broadcast in 1986 were intended for commercial release on cassette tape, but due to a technical issue not all the sonatas were released. Gerard Willems is the first pianist in Australia to record the 32 sonatas on CD. In January 2001, in a recital at the City Recital Hall in Sydney, he played Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata. The reviewer for The Sydney Morning Herald, Harriet Cunningham, said he had some memory lapses. To rebuff this, he asked Daniel Herscovitch, lecturer in music at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, to review the tapes of the performance broadcast by ABC Classic FM. Herscovitch found there were some finger slips, but no more than might be expected of pianists of international standing, and no memory lapses at all.

Background  By late 1901, de Wet's guerilla force based itself near the settlements of Lindley, Bethlehem and Reitz in the northeast part of the Orange Free State. On 28 November, de Wet called a krijgsraad (war council) of the still-active Boer leaders near Reitz. They determined to strike back at their British tormentors, who numbered 20,000 men. As part of Lord Kitchener's strategy, the British constructed lines of blockhouses and barbed wire across the veld. The blockhouse lines were designed to restrict the movements of the Boer guerillas so they could be trapped by British mobile columns. One line of blockhouses reached from Harrismith to the Tradoux farm, east of Bethlehem. To protect the construction, Major General Sir Leslie Rundle deployed four dispersed forces. Rundle with 330 men and one gun guarded the wagon road; the end of the blockhouse line was held by 150 infantry; a 400-man regiment of the Imperial Light Horse lay to the east at Elands River Bridge; Major Williams with 550 men, mostly of the 11th Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry, a 15-pounder gun and a pom-pom held the high Groenkop.Pakenham, p 575  Battle  De Wet carefully scouted the Groenkop position for three days. He noted that the British posted their sentries atop the sheer west side of the kop, instead of at the bottom where they could give timely warning of an attack. The Boer leader determined to scale the west side using the trace of a gully. At 2:00 am on Christmas morning, de Wet's commando clambered up the steep slope in single file with their boots removed so as to minimise any noise. The surprise was nearly total. Challenged by a single sentry when they were over halfway to the top with a few scattered shots, the Boers, who were ordered into battle by de Wet shouting \\"Stormt Burgers\\" swarmed up and over the crest. They began firing downhill into the British tents, inflicting a \\"massacre.\\"Pakenham, p 576 Savage fighting lasted about 40 minutes before the British gave up.Evans, p 154  Aftermath  The next morning, one of the 206 British prisoners of the Boers noted that his foes were so short of clothing that some wore women's attire. The 250 unwounded British prisoners of war were stripped literally naked before they were turned loose the next day. Kitchener wrote, \\"It is very sad and depressing that the boers are able to strike such blows, but I fear ... we shall always be liable to something of the sort from the unchecked rush of desperate men at night.\\"Pakenham, p 577 By 5 February 1902, Kitchener's blockhouse lines were completed and he sent 9,000 men on a massive sweep through the countryside. In this first operation, 285 Boers were captured but de Wet and President Marthinus Steyn and their men escaped the trap. The second drive lasted from 16 February to 28. Again, de Wet got away, but this time he had to abandon most of his cattle. On 27 February, Colonel Henry Rawlinson's column encircled and captured a 650-man Boer commando at Lang Reit, a few miles from Tweefontein. This brought the British \\"bag\\" in the successful sweep to 778 surrendered Boers. The third drive by Major Elliott's division, from 4 March to 11 March, was a failure, with only about 100 Boers captured. Worse, de Wet escaped to join Fighting General Koos de la Rey in the Western Transvaal.Pakenham, p 579-582  References   Bibliography  * Evans, Martin Marix. The Boer War: South Africa 1899-1902.

Blanton taught at Rice University and Hunter College of the City University of New York before joining the faculty at Purdue University in 1976. He is currently () Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Purdue's College of Liberal Arts. Blanton helped to develop full coverage survey methods, which he and colleagues applied to the Valley of Oaxaca to help understand the evolution of the Monte Alban state.Richard Blanton et al., Monte Alban‚Äôs Hinterland (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Museum, 1982) The particular method developed by Blanton and his students influenced a generation of archaeologists and are still widely used today.Suzanne Fish, The Archaeology of Regions: The Case for Full Coverage Survey (New York: Percheron Press, 2009) Due to his interest in regional survey, Blanton helped to introduce methods of spatial analysis into archaeology. In particular he took an application of graph theory used by architects evaluate movement through buildings and developed it into a method for analyzing prehistoric houses and communities.Richard Blanton, Houses and Households: A Comparative Study, (New York: Plenum, 1994) He was able to demonstrate that variation in the layout of houses and communities was associated with wealth differences. In addition, Blanton's method was used to develop a measure of prehistoric warfare frequency that has proven useful in a number of settings.Peter N.

Prior to this, he served as a city alderman between 1874 and 1878. Logan's major work as mayor was to create incentives for the federal government to build the Canadian Pacific Railway route through Winnipeg. Charles Tupper, then the Canadian minister of public works, originally intended to locate the railway away from the city, but relented when Logan led a series of city measures to provide the railway with exemption from taxation, land donation for the passenger terminal. Logan also presided over a council decision to offer funding for a bridge across the Red River which resulted in the construction of the Louise Bridge.

History The history of Panaikulam is known for the past 200 years only. Before that, there seems to be no recorded history. From the oral information collected from the old people and with the help of a will document written by one of the descendants in the family of first migrants, it is known that Tamil-speaking Muslims migrated from adjacent parts of Ramanathapuram (e.g. Kothakottai, Udaichiyarvalasai, aalappuli ) to a place with pond and lot of palm trees. They named it as Panai (meaning palm tree) kulam (meaning pond). This pond (now called as Pugaloorani) served as the water source for the people and their cattle. Slowly the migrated population moved towards the inner parts of the village and established a mosque (now Jumma Mosque) for praying.Panaikulam , Panaikulam website The migrations continued from the adjacent villages of Ramanathapuram and Panaikulam became a Muslim village. Some of the migrants used handlooms to weave the cloths and made business out of it. After some time, the mosque was built up using natural stones. It is indeed a very rare architectural beauty. During the nineteenth century, opportunities present in Malaya (now called Malaysia) attracted Panaikulam people and many of them went to Malaya to earn money. They mostly settled in Penang in businesses such as money exchange and restaurants. Language The primary language spoken by the people of Panaikulam is Tamil. Even though the accent is similar to that of the Tamil spoken in rest of Tamil Nadu, it has unique words probably borrowed from Arabic, Malay and Urdu. Certain peculiar words like nadayam (for slipper) and aanam (for curry) are used. Food and cuisine The food habits practised by the Panaikulam people have similarities with Tamil Muslim cuisine, Sri Lankan MuslimSri Lankan Tamil Muslims cuisine and Malay cuisine. For example, the foods such as Watalappam and Idiyappam are regularly prepared and eaten by Sri Lankan Tamil Muslims and Tamil Muslims settled in Malaysia and Singapore.

Cato Island Solar powered weather station on Cato Island Cato Island (), is a small oval-shaped island lying approximately east of Gladstone, Queensland and about east-southeast of the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. This island is approximately south of Bird Islet, part of the east end of Wreck Reefs. The island is a mound of coral debris and grit high, covered in grass and creepers up to high. An automatic weather station, with two radio masts and a silver-painted hut, stands on the island's northeast end.Latest coastal weather observations for Cato Island. The island is almost entirely surrounded by reefs: three narrow boat passages cross the reefs on the northern side. The best entrance is the center one, located north of the eastern end of Cato Island; it has a conspicuous rock at half tide on its eastern side. The island lies on the western end of an oval-shaped reef enclosing a lagoon. The lagoon contains numerous coral heads. The sea breaks over the reef in all weather. The reef lies on Cato Bank, which falls away steeply on all sides. The coral reefs are built on the top of a large shield volcano, produced by eruptions of the Tasmantid Seamount Chain. Hutchison Rock , with a depth of , lies east of Cato Reef. Danger Patch lies near the outer end of the eastern ledge of Cato Bank. A tidal race is found between the eastern end of Cato Reef and Danger Patch. History =Early reports= Cato Island, and then Bird Islet, were found by Captain John Park on and Lt. Robert Fowler on on 17 August 1803. Porpoise ran aground on Wreck Reef. Matthew Flinders (1814) on Porpoise reported that the cays held many birds, laying eggs from August‚ÄìOctober.Flinders, M. 1814. A Voyage to Terra Australis in the years 1801, 1802 and 1803. London, G. and W. Nicol (volume 2-page 298). On 1 April 1821, the whaler was wrecked on the shoal, though her crew was saved. Cato Reef remained a hazard to shipping crossing between Australia and Canton (modern day Guangzhou) or India (where cargo was collected on the way home from Australia to Europe). In due course the southern reefs were surveyed by Captain H. M. Denham (ms, 1860) on in 1858‚Äì60. The area was visited by increasing numbers of whalers during the off season in New Zealand, in search of the wintering humpback and sperm whalesTownsend, C.H.1935. \\"The distribution of certain whales as shown by the logbook records of American whaleships\\".

Hachette, Paris, vol. 1:2ll‚Äë233 Denham reported that in July 1863 the islets had only two or three plants, including a bush high, and were frequented by sea turtles weighing . On 12 October 1858, Denham reported that Cato Island was more substantial than other cays in the area, measuring , rising to , and covered in coarse tufted grass, Rottboilla; a creeping plant, Nyctagin portulaca; and a sort of buttercup Senebiera crucifera, undermined and fertilised by burrowing mutton birds, the only species that the sailors chose to eat. Dense colonies of gannets, man-of-war birds and boatswain birds, terns and noddies, with eggs and chicks were abundant. Denham shot a godwit and a brace of plovers. Whalers recorded repeated visits, but only one humpback was reported offshore. Rayner recorded Limosa, Charadrius, Strepsilas interpres, and a land rail. When they returned with plants from the Percy Isles and seeds from Sydney to provide succour for castaways in August 1859, Denham again reported that the birds formed a cloud hovering above the island, though \\"a few visits like ours would tend to check the accumulation in proportion to each boat bringing off upwards of 100 dozen eggs at a three hours gleaning.\\" =Guano mining= On 27 October 1862, the British government granted an exclusive concession to exploit the guano on Lady Elliot Island, Wreck Reefs, Swain Reefs, Raine Island, Bramble Cay, Brampton Shoal, and Pilgrim IslandPilgrim Island is not located, possibly somewhere off Western Australia to the Anglo-Australian Guano Company organised by whaler Dr. W.

The crew spent 15 days repairing the ship's boats before leaving for Moreton Bay, which was reached on 27 August.Loney, J. K. (Jack Kenneth), 1925‚Äì1995 =Thomas King= Thomas King, a barque of 346 tons, built for the West Indian sugar run, was taken to Australia for the gold rush. Captain J. H. Walker, with a crew shanghaied with the help of local police, after the original English crew had deserted for the gold fields, left Sydney on 4 April 1852 for the Philippines and China with a cargo of sugar and spirits. It wrecked on a reef east of Cato Reef, Queensland, 17 April 1852. The barque struck the reef and became a total wreck. Some of her boats washed away. A boat set out for the mainland to seek help, leaving survivors on the reef. After 14 days they were rescued by the whaler Lady Blackwood. The other boat eventually made Double Island Bay, but when the occupants set out overland for Moreton Bay they were tracked down by aborigines and all but the captain and one seaman were killed. When lost, Thomas King carried 3,500 pounds of specie and 8,000 pounds of gold dust. At the time of sailing it was reported that the gold aboard Thomas King consisted of 212 ounces owned by L. and S. Spyer and 220 ounces 8 penny weights 12 grains owned A. and M.

In animal studies, 5-APDB's effects generalize most closely to non-stimulant MDMA analogues such as MBDB and MMAI, while producing no substitution for LSD or amphetamine. In vitro studies show that 5-APDB acts as a highly selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA), with IC50 values of 130 nM, 7,089 nM, and 3,238 nM for inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, respectively. In contrast, 6-APDB is more balanced on the three monoamine neurotransmitters and acts more similarly to MDA and MDMA. Methoxy-substituted analogues of 5-APDB and 6-APDB have also been made and substituted for DOM in animal tests, although they were around one tenth as potent as DOM. Legal status =China= As of October 2015 5-APDB is a controlled substance in China. =UK= On June 10, 2013 5-APDB and a number of analogues were classified as Temporary Class Drugs in the UK following an ACMD recommendation. This means that sale and import of the named substances are criminal offences and are treated as for class B drugs.

J. Scott and starring Rick Schroder, Peter Fonda and Victoria Pratt. The film is very loosely based on the 1864 novel of the same name by Jules Verne. It was shot in HD on location in and around Vancouver in the summer of 2007, and first aired on Ion Television on January 27, 2008. It has since been released on DVD. Plot Heiress Martha Dennison (Victoria Pratt) seeks out professor Jonathan Brock (Rick Schroder) to help find her husband, Edward, who disappeared four years earlier on an expedition towards the center of the Earth. At first Jonathan is hesitant to go despite Martha's offer to handsomely pay him, giving him the opportunity to pay off the debts left to him by his recently deceased father, while his nephew and aspiring journalist Abel is excited for the opportunity to get real life journalistic experience. After reviewing Edward's notes Jonathan is persuaded to go along. The two of them, along with Abel, go to the newly acquired Alaskan territory to gather information about Edward and his expedition and find a Russian guide, Sergei, to aide their search of her husband. They struggle to cover a large amount of ground in only 10 days based upon information recovered from a crudely drawn map. They find and enter a mine shaft in a volcano, venturing deep into the center of the earth. Along the way small signs are found of the previous expedition along with the skeleton of Mikael, a friend like a brother to Sergei, and see it as an ominous sign of what's ahead. Abel constantly lags behind taking notes and pictures of the journey and discovers a passage to a strange new land. They come out into a world that, at first, seems much like the surface except that it never gets dark despite there being no sun with a lush forest land and a large lake-like sea. Soon they encounter many prehistoric creatures and the adventure really begins. While Martha takes a bath and short swim she is attacked by some sort of creature in the sea, at the same time Jonathan and Sergei find some logs that were clearly cut down by a person using an axe to make a raft to cross the sea. They use the left over logs and their supply of rope to make a raft of their own and notice several dinosaur-like birds flying above their heads in a vulture like fashion. As some of the birds move into attack they notice another large dinosaur in the water heading for their raft. Jonathan suggests shooting the birds to distract and feed the much larger and more lethal dinosaur in the water. They then discuss the nature of the creatures that they encountered noting that they seem to have come from different eras of development and may have escaped to this region to survive Ice Ages and other dinosaur-killing phenomenona. They then find another damaged raft, believed to be Edward's, and decide to make camp. While Abel goes exploring alone, Sergei reveals to Jonathan that he did not go along with Edward when he first came to Alaska because he did not trust him and blames himself for not stopping Mikael from joining the expedition that led to his death. Abel encounters two native women in the forest and he gathers the rest to follow a trail that may lead them to more answers. While crossing a rather well-made bridge a group of hostile natives surround them and bring them to their village to meet their leader who is Edward himself, who acts rather coldly towards them and forces them to bow and give up their weapons as a native custom. Edward elaborates the nature of his conditions, that the villagers believe him to be some kind of a god who has brought them prosperity and safety by sharing his wisdom which are actually ideas of indigenous survival he got from studying other civilizations. In a private discussion with him, Martha admits that she was expecting him to be more happy to see her; he then admits that he had never expected her to come for him and intends to stay there where he has power and influence compared to the world above where he found her power threatening. Edward makes a pass at Martha and she rebuffs him and he goes to the village priestess whom he regards as a new wife. While they are talking a group of natives join forces and free some prisoners. When Edward leaves his tent and finds these people he begins to shoot at them and kills one young man in front of all the others claiming that he is a traitor. Martha slaps him causing him to bleed planting seeds of doubt that he is a god; he then explains that their leader (who escaped with help from Jonathan) has doubted Edward from the start and started a resistance to his rule and that the presence of the renegades has undercut Edward's power and so the resistance must be destroyed. Martha explains that Edward has always been this way and that his arrogance is what attracted her to him in the first place. Edward then loses his power and influence over the tribe as he has been revealed to be a false god and all of the villagers leave him. He then leaves all of his village gear behind and states that they must now leave and that their raft has been destroyed so they must take an ancient passage; meanwhile the resistance is hot on their trail to stop them. When the resistance advances upon them Edward holds out a single piece of dynamite to ward off their attacks and when they reach the cave he lights the dynamite with the hope that it will seal the entrance to the cave that leads to the surface. When it fails to ignite, Edward leaves the cave and shoots the dynamite sealing the rest of the group in, and him out with the violent resistance. The team then struggles through water filled passages that lead them up through to the lake on the surface, where they originally found the entrance to the cave. On the surface they make a small memorial for Edward, who is presumed dead, and decide not to tell the secret of the world below, and to continue their adventures to the East Indies with Martha and Jonathan (most unpredictably) as an item. Abel then writes at the end of his diary that everything he has written and drawn about is only a figment of his imagination so as to discredit their discoveries.

Eventually, politics of memory may determine the way history is written and passed on. Memories are also influenced by cultural forces, e.g. popular culture, as well as social norms. It has also been connected with the construction of identity. Cyprus The two sides in the conflict in Cyprus maintain widely divergent and contrasting memories of the events that split the island. The term selective memory is applied by psychologists to people suffering from head injuries who retain some memories, but have amnesia about others. Societal trauma, such as war, seems to have a similar effect. Recollections that are shaped out of a phenomenon common to many countries traumatized by war and repression, may be remembered in radically different ways by people who experienced similar events. The selectivity may also serve a political purpose, for example to justify the claims of one group over a competing group. Cyprus is a poignant case for this phenomenon. The longstanding conflict on the island reflects deep roots in the \\"motherlands\\" of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot peoples. Germany In Germany, Politics of memory (Geschichtspolitik) is most often associated with how to memorialise the Nazi Germany and World War II. Often different events of this era have been measured against one another and, in this way, evaluated, e.g. the Holocaust, the war against Eastern Europe with its ethnic cleansing programs, but also the bombings of cities by German and Allied forces alike or the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe. Speeches by politicians often deal with issues of how to memorialize the past. Richard von Weizs√§cker as Bundespr√§sident identified two modes of memorializing the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 in his famous 1985 speech: this date can be seen as defeat or liberation. Weizs√§cker backed the latter Interpretation. In this regard, such moments as the first official \\"Day of Commemoration for Victims of National Socialism\\", on January 20, 1996, led to Bundespr√§sident Roman Herzog remarking in his address to the German Parliament that \\"Remembrance gives us strength, since it helps to keep us from going astray.\\" In similar, but somewhat opposing measure, Gerhard Schr√∂der sought to move beyond this in saying the generation that committed such deeds has passed, and a new generation does not have the same fault because they simply weren't there to be responsible. Good examples for politics of memory could be seen in national monuments and the discourses surrounding their construction. The construction of a holocaust memorial in memory of the murdered Jews of Europe at a central location in Berlin was met with protests but also with strong support. Likewise the National Memorial to the Victims of War and Tyranny was deemed inappropriate by some onlookers and a discussion revolved around the question whether the lack of a differentiation between victims and perpetrators is adequate or not. The question if and how to memorise Germans expelled from Poland in the aftermath of World War II has been constantly debated in both West Germany and Poland. Such questions are so difficult because it requires a moral judgement of these events. These judgements differ remarkably. For instance, the Federation of German Expellees called on Poland to pay compensation for lost property to Germans from what after 1945 became Polish territory, a claim that is consistently declined by Poland. Similarly there have been debates in Germany whether the legacy of World War II implies that Germany's military should be confined to purely defensive measure like peacekeeping or, contrary to this, this legacy can be a justification of an active enforcement of human rights which also might involve preemptive strikes. Monuments Monuments keep alive the memories of conflicts. Their removals may be controversial: in Estonia the removal of a Soviet era statue from the capital evoked strong reaction from Russia. Efficacy and moral relativity W. G. Sebald underlines German amnesia surrounding the Allied carpet bombings of 131 German cities and towns which turned many German cities into vast necropolises, and resulted in an estimated 600,000 primarily civilian deaths, with millions of internal refugees. In literature Milan Kundera's opening story in the Book of Laughter and Forgetting is about a Slovak official posing with other officials for a photograph in winter. The man gives his fur hat to cover his superior's bald head and the photo is taken. Later, when he falls out of favour and is denounced and removed from official records and documents, he is even air- brushed out of photographs; all that remains of him is his fur hat.Milan Kundera: A man who cannot forget By MICHIKO KAKUTANI Published: January 18, 1982 https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D91138F93BA25752C0A964948260&scp;=2&sq;=book%20of%20laughter%20and%20forgetting%20politics%20of%20history&st;=cse Winston Churchill is purported to have said that \\"history is written by the victors.\\" The accuracy and significance of this statement is still debated.Finding a roadmap to teach kids about Mideast Study examines history textbooks for Israelis, Palestinians By Jill Wagner NBC News Fri., May. 6, 2005 http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7759863 Raul Hilberg's autobiography is titled The politics of memory.

It straddles Interstate 5, between the Columbia Slough on the south and the Columbia River on the north. The section east of the Interstate is known as East Delta Park, and to the west is West Delta Park. The latter area was formerly known as the city of Vanport, created during World War II to house shipbuilders and destroyed by a flood in 1948. The Owens Sports Complex, a large part of East Delta Park, includes seven softball fields, nine soccer fields, and a concessions building. The complex is named for William V. Owens, a former park superintendent who developed and managed the city's softball program. East Delta Park also has a dog off-leash area, a football field, paved paths, picnic tables, a playground, and a volleyball court. The Portland Parks & Recreation Department operates the park, which is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. The Urban Forestry Division of the Portland Parks Department maintains a street-tree arboretum in East Delta Park. The trees are the varieties the division recommends for planting in public rights-of-way between curbs and sidewalks. Headquartered in the park, the division uses the arboretum to teach tree identification to members of Friends of Trees and similar community organizations. Portland International Raceway, for car, motorcycle and bicycle racing, is part of West Delta Park. Sharing the park with the raceway are the Heron Lakes Golf Course, a dog off-leash area, and natural areas. Force Lake at in the northwest corner of the golf course attracts many species of birds. Signs around the lake describe the wildlife and explain the history of Vanport.

Some proponents of the trifunctional hypothesis distinguish two types of threefold deaths in Indo-European myth and ritual. In the first type of threefold death, one person dies simultaneously in three ways. He dies by hanging (or strangulation or falling from a tree), by drowning (or poison), and by wounding. These three deaths are foretold, and are often punishment for an offense against the three functions of Indo- European society.Mallory, J. P., Adams, Douglass Q., Encyclopedia of Indo- European Culture, p. 577 The second form of the threefold death is split into three distinct parts; these distinct deaths are sacrifices to three distinct gods of the three functions. Literary sources =Welsh legend= In Welsh legend, Myrddin Wyllt (one of the sources for Merlin of Arthurian legend) is associated with threefold death. As a test of his skill, Merlin is asked to prophesy how a boy will die. He says the boy will fall from a rock. The same boy, with a change of clothes, is presented again, and Merlin prophesies that he will hang. Then, dressed in a girl's clothes, the boy is presented, and Merlin replies, \\"Woman or no, he will drown.\\" As a young man, the victim, in a hunt, falls from a rock, is caught in a tree, and hanging head down in a lake, drowns.Bragg, Melvyn, \\"Merlin\\" In Our Time 30 June 2005, BBC4, http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20050630.shtml Myrddin Wyllt also reportedly prophesied his own death, which would happen by falling, stabbing, and drowning. This was fulfilled when a gang of jeering shepherds drove him off a cliff, where he was impaled on a stake left by fishermen, and died with his head below water. =Odin= The Norse god Odin is also associated with the threefold death. Human sacrifices to Odin were hanged from trees. Odin is said to have hanged himself in order to learn the secrets of magic. =Commenta Bernensia= One of the most prominent examples of this threefold death in three separate sacrifices comes to us from Lucan In his epic poem, Pharsalia, which relates Caesar's conquest of Gaul, he describes a set of three Celtic gods who receive human sacrifices: et quibus inmitis placatur sanguine diro/ Teutates horrensque feris altaribus Esus/ et Taranis Scythicae non mitior ara Dianae. (\\"To whom they appease with cruel blood, harsh Teutates, and wild, bristling Esus, and Taranis whose altar is as insatiable as that of Scythian Diana.\\") Lucan, \\"Pharsalia\\", I.441‚Äì446 http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Luc.+1.441&fromdoc;=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0133 Trans. James Kennedy 2008 One of the marginal notes in a 10th-century manuscript of the Pharsalia, known as the Commenta Bernensia is highly important for an understanding of how these lines relate to Proto-Indo- European culture. ‚ÄúThe later... scholiasts... elaborate on Lucan: they elicit the information that Taranis was propitiated by burning, Teutates by drowning, and Esus by means of suspending his victims from trees and ritually wounding them‚Äù Green, Miranda J. Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend. Pg. 85. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1992. . This scholium is of huge significance to understanding whether this text contains evidence of the threefold death in Celtic worship. It is a distinctive detail, and it matches closely with numerous other details that relate to ritual practice in Indo-European society. > In recent years an Indo-European pattern of threefold death has been > identified and discussed in terms of this tripartite ideology by a number of > followers of Dumezil... The pattern is found in myths and legends of various > Indo-European peoples in two main forms. The first of these is a series or > grouping of three deaths, each by a different means. The second is a single > death by three different means simultaneously.Evans, David. \\"Agamemnon and > the Indo-European Threefold Death Pattern.\\" History of Religions, Vol. 19, > No. 2 (Nov., 1979), pp. 153‚Äì166 Evans goes on to cite numerous stories from various Indo-European societies. All of these stories he tells contain this theme of a tripartite death. He argues, following Dumezil, that three distinct methods of sacrifice, corresponding to the three functional deities, was an important Proto-Indo- European ritual. =Vita Columbae= There are a number of stories in Celtic mythology that clearly are formed by the Tripartite functions of Proto-Indo- European. The theme of triple-death occurs in several places in medieval Celtic sources. The first story comes from the Life of St. Columba (Vita Columbae): > Aedh, surnamed the Black, descended of a royal family, and a Cruthinian by > race. Aedh wore the clerical habit, and came with the purpose of residing > with him in the monastery for some years. Now this Aedh the Black had been a > very bloodthirsty man, and cruelly murdered many persons, amongst others > Diarmuid, son of Cerbul, by divine appointment king of all. This same Aedh, > then, after spending some time in his retirement, was irregularly ordained > priest by a bishop invited for the purpose... The bishop, however, would not > venture to lay a hand upon his head unless Findchan, who was greatly > attached to Aedh in a carnal way, should first place his right hand on his > head as a mark of approval. When such an ordination afterwards became known > to the saint, he was deeply grieved, and in consequence forthwith pronounced > this fearful sentence on the ill-fated Findchan and Aedh... And Aedh, thus > irregularly ordained, shall return as a dog to his vomit, and be again a > bloody murderer, until at length, pierced in the neck with a spear, he shall > fall from a tree into the water and be drowned... But Aedh the Black, a > priest only in name, betaking himself again to his former evil doings, and > being treacherously wounded with a spear, fell from the prow of a boat into > a lake and was drowned.Columba, I. 29. Retrieved from > https://archive.org/stream/lifeofsaintcolum00adamuoft/lifeofsaintcolum00adamuoft_djvu.txt > on 24 December 2008 This story of triple-death corresponds to the elements which Evans finds in a whole host of similar stories. In all of these stories, the tripartite death is foretold. Here St. Columba foretells the triple death of Aedh. At the same time Columba's prophecy is a curse or a punishment which he dispenses to Aedh because of his sins. This leads to the next element common in many 'Triple- death' stories, the sins of the warrior. According to Dumezil, the warrior often commits a sin against each one of the functions.Mallory, J. P., Adams, Douglass Q., Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Pg. 635 He is punished for each sin, with a punishment fitting for his crime. In this passage from the Life of St. Columba, three specific sins are mentioned. Aedh blasphemes by being ordained a priest outside of the Church. This is a sin against the priestly function of Indo-European society. Aedh's second sin is murder; he has killed numerous people, most notably King Diarmuid. This is a sin against the warrior function. Aedh's last sin is against the productive/fertile function in Indo-European society, he has slept with another man‚Äîan act which is by its very nature unfertile. The Tripartite death of Aedh is linked with another story of triple-death. Diarmuid, who is killed by Aedh, also dies a triple death: > When the king sent men to arrest Aedh, St. Ronan hid him and so Diarmuid had > Ronan arrested and tried in his stead. He was condemned by the ecclasiastics > for this act and Ronan himself uttered the famous curse, 'Desolate be Tara > forever!' Soon after, Tara was abandoned, never to achieve its former > splendor... [Diarmuid's wife] had an affair with Flann, so Diarmuid had > Flann's fortress burnt over his head. Sorely wounded, Flann tried to escape > the flames by crawling into a vat of water where he drowned... Bec Mac De > [Diarmuid's druid councilor] prophesied that Diarmuid would be killed by > Flann's kinsman, Aedh Dubh in the house of Banban... The manner of his death > would be by slaughter, by burning, by drowning and by the ridge pole of a > roof falling on his head... The Prophecy seemed so unlikely that Diarmuid > scorned it, even when Banban invited him to a feast... Aedh Dubh was there > and stabbed the High King with his spear. Wounded, Diarmuid fled back into > the house. Aedh Dubh's men set fire to it. Seeking to escape the flame, > Diarmuid scrambled into a vat of ale. A burning ridge pole fell on to his > head. The prophecy was fulfilled (Ellis, 84). Both of the elements which Evans discusses are present in this story of Diarmuid's death. In this story, there is a prophecy of the threefold death before it occurs. In fact, Diarmuid's death is foretold by three different men in the original story. Diarmuid has also clearly violated two of the three functions. He sins against the sanctity of the priestly function, by trying St. Ronan. For this crime Ronan curses the throne at Tara. Diarmuid also murders Flann, a violation of the warrior function. Diarmuid is punished for his transgressions by the triple nature of his death. =Comparative evidence= The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture cites several more examples of Indo-European myths that evidence a \\"conjunction of trifunctional signs and death-modes\\": * In the myth of Starkad, King Vikar is hanged or strangled on the waterside, while pierced by a reed that turns into a spear. * King Agamemnon is stabbed in his bath, while caught in a net. * Siegfried is killed by a weapon while drinking from a spring, near a tree (so that \\"hanging and drowning themes remain as mere suggestions\\"). * Oleg of Novgorod's death, as reported in the Primary Chronicle, is a \\"slightly distorted\\" variant of the myth (see ). * Sources on early Swedish kings indicate that three died, respectively, by drowning, burning and hanging (Ynglinga Saga 14, 17, 22). Archaeology Alfred Dieck claimed a high number of up to 1,860 known bog bodies in Europe. Archaeologist Don Brothwell considers that many of the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The physical evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, but it does not explain why he was killed. Archaeologists John Hodgson and Mark Brennand suggest that bog bodies may have been related to religious practice, although there is division in the academic community over this issue and in the case of Lindow Man, whether the killing was murder or ritualistic is still debated. Anne Ross, an expert on Iron Age religion, proposed that the death was an example of human sacrifice and that the \\"triple death\\" (throat cut, strangled, and hit on the head) was an offering to several different gods. The wide date range for Lindow Man's death (2 BC to 119 AD) means he may have met his demise after the Romans conquered northern England in the 60s AD. As the Romans outlawed human sacrifice, this opens up other possibilities; this was emphasised by historian Ronald Hutton, who challenged the interpretation of sacrificial death.

He was the ninth of ten children. Mooring learned the rudiments of playing the fiddle from his mother - and from the time he first picked up the instrument it became an extension of the man for the rest of his life. At the age of 12, Mooring started playing the fiddle for parties. He remembered his early beginnings and humble ancestry by carrying with him throughout his life the first payment he ever received... 35 cents. He became one of the most respected fiddle players in North America, winning the North American Fiddle Championship Trophy, in Shelburne, Ontario, Canada, for three consecutive years: 1964-66. Judges remarks included references to his ability to translate a waltz (e.g. The Twilight Waltz, The Dauphin Waltz) with such intense emotion. During his lifetime he released twelve record albums and appeared on many radio and television shows including The Don Messer and Tommy Hunter shows. He was an enthusiastic composer of fiddle tunes and tried his hand at writing songs. He sings and plays fiddle on the album, \\"Four Strings and I\\". Apart from the fiddle he also played piano, organ, accordion, banjo, mandolin, clarinet and trumpet. Brian Buchanan of Enter the Haggis wrote that Mooring \\"was arguably the first 'rock star' of traditional Canadian music.\\" Mooring had two daughters, Sandra and Sharon Mooring, and four grandchildren and seven great grandchildren.

A large British force which had concentrated at the garrison town of Ladysmith launched a sortie on 30 October 1899, against Boer armies which were slowly surrounding the town. The result was a disaster for the British. The main body was driven back into the town, and an isolated detachment of 800 men was forced to surrender to Commandant De Wet. The Boers did not follow up their advantage by proceeding towards the strategically important port of Durban, and instead began a Siege of Ladysmith, which was relieved after 118 days. removed John Norwood VC was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Battle of Ladysmith. Background In June 1899, when it appeared hostilities between Britain and the independent Boer republics were likely, the British government began sending troops to South Africa as a precaution. Most went to Natal, where the vital port of Durban appeared to be within comparatively easy striking distance for the Boer forces. The British government was unwilling to order a complete mobilization, but on the recommendation of the Commander in Chief of the British Army, General Wolseley, they agreed to send 10,000 troops which Wolseley believed could defend Natal if war broke out until reinforcements could arrive by sea. The first contingent were some troops returning to Britain from India, under Major General Penn Symons. The War Office subsequently dispatched units from garrisons in the Mediterranean and elsewhere, eventually totaling 15,000. Lieutenant General Sir George White was appointed to command this enlarged force. White was 64 years old, and suffered from a leg injury incurred in a riding accident. Having served mainly in India, he had little previous experience in South Africa. =British deployments= Natal was divided roughly into northern and southern parts by the Tugela River. Northern Natal was surrounded on three sides by Boer territory. Although advised to deploy his force south of the Tugela, White rejected this advice for reasons of prestige.Pakenham (1979), pp.107‚Äì108 Other senior British officers considered that White was badly advised by over-eager officers such as Penn-Symons or White's Adjutant General, Colonel Ian Hamilton.Pakenham (1979), pp.161, p.178 White concentrated the bulk of his force at Ladysmith, about north of the Tugela, while a brigade under Penn-Symons was posted even further north at Glencoe and Dundee. Penn Symons' position was particularly exposed to danger, being so far north that it was vulnerable to being surrounded, while not far enough north to block the passes through the Drakensberg mountains which the main Boer armies would have to cross to invade Natal. Outbreak of war Contrary to the advice of several British officials such as Sir Alfred Milner, the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, the independent Boer governments were not over-awed by the despatch of British troops to Natal. Instead, they regarded it as evidence of Britain's determination to seize control of the Boer republics. The South African Republic or Transvaal government under President Paul Kruger considered launching an attack in September, but President Steyn of the Orange Free State dissuaded them for several weeks while he tried to act as intermediary. With the complete breakdown in negotiations, both independent republics declared war and attacked on 12 October. A total of 21,000 Boers advanced into Natal from all sides.Pakenham (1979), p.106 The only regular uniformed units were the Staatsartillerie of both republics (and some units of policemen such as the South African Republic Police or ZARP). The rest were mainly farmers, dressed in their ordinary working clothes, with some townsmen and contingents of foreign volunteers known as Vrijwilligers. Replica of the 155 mm Creusot Long Tom gun. All were mounted, and most were armed with Mauser Bolt action rifles. The artillery had two dozen German manufactured Krupp field guns and four heavy French manufactured 155 mm Creusot Long Tom guns. On 20 October, two Boer forces attacked Penn-Symons' detachment at Dundee but were driven back at the Battle of Talana Hill. The British suffered heavy casualties (including Penn-Symons, who was mortally wounded) and were cut off from Ladysmith by another Boer force which captured a railway station at Elandslaagte which lay between them. On 21 October, British troops under Colonel Ian Hamilton and White's cavalry commander, Colonel John French, recaptured the station in the Battle of Elandslaagte. White was unable to follow up this success by relieving Penn- Symons's force (now commanded by Brigadier General J.H. Yule) as he feared that Boers from the Orange Free State were about to attack Ladysmith. This decision highlighted Ladysmith's exposed position. Yule's force had to make an exhausting four-day march across the Biggarsberg hills before they could rejoin White in Ladysmith. On 24 October, White made a demonstration at Rietfontein against the Boers pressing forward down the railway line from Glencoe to Ladysmith, to distract them from attacking Yule. The British suffered 132 casualties, mainly from artillery fire.Kruger, p.89 Battle of Ladysmith =British plans= Rather than retreat south of the Tugela, White continued to mass supplies and reinforcements in Ladysmith. (He sent the wounded south to Pietermaritzburg but left the civilians and other non- combatants in the town.) As the British troops concentrated in Ladysmith now constituted a balanced \\"field force\\" of all arms, White also rejected the option of leaving an infantry garrison in Ladysmith while sending the bulk of the mounted troops and artillery south of the river. He gambled on being able to strike a knock-out blow against the Boer armies in a \\"set-piece\\" action. This was despite the disadvantages of the terrain, with Ladysmith being on low ground surrounded by hills rising to above the town, which gave the Boers the advantage of height. Devonshire Regiment facing Pepworth Hill, firing from behind boulders which provided for an effective cover. From 26 to 29 October, White sent out tentative cavalry reconnaissances, which he recalled when it appeared that Boer horsemen might cut them off. On 29 October, Boers could be seen emplacing one of their heavy Creusot siege guns on Pepworth Hill, roughly north-north east of the town. Before this gun could open fire, White had already made plans for attack the following dawn, based on incomplete reconnaissances and observations. The main frontal attack was intended to capture Pepworth Hill. The column was led by Colonel Ian Hamilton and consisted of the 1st battalion, the Devonshire Regiment, 1st battalion, the Manchester Regiment, 2nd battalion, the Gordon Highlanders and 2nd battalion, the Rifle Brigade. This attack was to be supported by a column under Colonel Grimwood, consisting of the 1st and 2nd battalions, the King's Royal Rifle Corps, 1st battalion, the Leicestershire Regiment, 1st battalion, the King's Liverpool Regiment and the 2nd battalion, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, which would attack the supposed Boer left flank and capture Long Hill, about east of Pepworth Hill. The bulk of the mounted troops under Colonel John French (the 5th Lancers, 5th Dragoon Guards, 18th Hussars less a squadron lost at Talana Hill, 19th Hussars, several companies of Mounted infantry, the Natal Carbineers and Imperial Light Horse were stationed in reserve or to Grimwood's right. Six batteries (the 13th, 21st, 42nd, 53rd, 67th and 69th) of 15-pounder guns of the Royal Artillery were to support the attacks. White also sent a detachment consisting of the 1st battalion, the Royal Irish Fusiliers and half the 1st battalion, the Gloucestershire Regiment, with number 10 Mountain Battery (equipped with RML 2.5-inch Mountain Guns) to capture a pass known as Nicholson's Nek which lay about to the northwest of Pepworth Hill. The force was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Carleton of the Royal Irish Fusiliers. White intended that by seizing the pass, this detachment would prevent the Boer force from the Orange Free State reinforcing the Transvaal Boers on Pepworth Hill, and also prevent the defeated Boers retreating directly north. =Lombard's Kop= Grimwood's brigade had deployed during the night around Lombard's Kop and Farquhar's Farm, and faced north towards Long Hill. As dawn broke, Grimwood found that half his brigade had straggled, and French's mounted troops had not reached their assigned position. Before this could be corrected, the British troops came under heavy rifle fire from their own right flank. The Boers in this sector were nominally commanded by the elderly Commandant Lukas Meyer, but were actually led by Louis Botha.Kruger, p.93 At the same time, the first shell from the Boers' \\"Long Tom\\" on Pepworth Hill landed in the town, causing consternation. The British field guns opened fire on Pepworth Hill and Long Hill, and temporarily silenced the Boer siege gun but Colonel Ian Hamilton's frontal attack on Pepworth Hill was called off as it became clear that Grimwood was in trouble, and Hamilton's attack would not be supported. Although the main body of South African Republic Boers under Commandant-General Piet Joubert were stationed behind Pepworth Hill, there were none on Long Hill, and fire on this hill was wasted. The British artillery itself came under accurate and effective fire from the Boers' field guns, which were fought as individual gun detachments, and were quickly moved between emplacements before British guns could find their range. The British guns were deployed as they had been drilled to do, in neat rows of six without using cover from artillery or even rifle fire. Their fire was not as effective as that of the Boer Staatsartillerie, and they incurred needless casualties.McElwee, p.220 After four hours, White had received no messages from Carleton, although firing could be heard from the position he was supposed to have occupied. With no prospect of a successful attack, he ordered his troops to \\"retire as opportunity offers\\". As they began to fall back into the open plain between Lombard's Kop and Ladysmith, they came under heavy fire from Botha's riflemen and the Boer gun on Pepworth Hill. Some of Grimwood's units (mainly those which had already suffered heavy casualties at Talana Hill, and were short of officers and tired) panicked and the retreat became a rout. Two batteries of field guns covered the retreat by withdrawing in stages, each battery providing covering fire in turn while the other limbered up and fell back. The British were also very fortunate that a detachment of naval guns (four 12-pounder and two 4.7-inch guns, under Captain Percy Scott of ) arrived by train in Ladysmith and went almost straight into action.Kruger, p.95 Their first few rounds immediately found the range to Pepworth Hill and suppressed the Boers' \\"Long Tom\\". The British fell back into Ladysmith, with units temporarily demoralised. The day was subsequently termed \\"Mournful Monday\\".Pakenham (1979), p.154 Nevertheless, the Boers did not immediately take advantage of their victory. It is said that when Joubert was urged to follow up the British infantry, he replied, \\"When God stretches out a finger, do not take the whole hand\\".Kruger, p.97 =Nicholson's Nek= White was not aware of the fate of Carleton's force until the next day, when Joubert sent a letter which also unilaterally granted an armistice to allow the dead to be buried. Carleton's force had been late setting out because the mules carrying his guns and reserve ammunition had not been properly controlled by inexperienced drivers and had been fractious. As dawn approached, Carleton feared that because of the late start, his force would be exposed at daybreak in the open plain between Pepworth Hill and the Nek. He therefore decided to occupy a hill known as Tchrengula just to the south of the Nek. As they climbed the hill, the mules bolted and startled British soldiers fired several shots, alerting the nearest Boers. Carleton's men began preparing sangars on what they thought was the summit of Tchrengula. In fact the mile-long summit was divided into two peaks, and in the dark, the British had occupied only the southern, lower summit. Vice Commandant Christiaan De Wet quickly grasped the situation, and led some men on horseback to gallop to the northern end of the hill, where they dismounted and climbed the hill to occupy the undefended northern summit. From there, the Boers pressed forward along the summit which was strewn with rocks which gave individual Boer riflemen ample cover. The British sangars were exposed and obvious targets to the Boers, and gave inadequate protection. Like the artillery, the British infantry relied on drill, firing volleys on the command of an officer. By the time the order had been given, the intended target was safe behind cover, while the British soldiers were exposed to fire.Kruger, p.96 The British infantry resisted for several hours, but the numbers of wounded and killed increased and ammunition ran out. Finally, as the main British force could be seen retreating into Ladysmith, Carleton gave the order to surrender. A British officer waved a white flag at the same time. Some of the British troops had seen no reason for the surrender and felt themselves humiliated by the order. Eight hundred soldiers were taken prisoner.Kruger, pp.95‚Äì96 Aftermath Since the Boers launched no immediate assault, the British force reorganised and constructed defensive lines around the town, which would require a major effort to overcome. They recovered morale through some small-scale raids at night which sabotaged some of the Boer artillery. Thereafter the siege became a long drawn-out blockade, except for a single storming attempt. After several failures, a force under General Redvers Buller, who was later known as \\"Sir Reverse\\" and the \\"Ferryman of the Tugela\\", broke through the Boer forces defending the Tugela to effect the Relief of Ladysmith on 28 February 1900. Britain then went on to regain control of South Africa.

The regiment was formed in November 1864. At full strength, it was composed of ten companies of foot soldiers. The regiment was used to guard trade routes and escorted immigrant wagon trains from Fort Boise to the Willamette Valley. Its troops were used to pursue and suppress Native American raiders in eastern Oregon and the Idaho Territory. Several detachments accompanied survey parties and built roads in central and southern Oregon. The regiment's last company was mustered out of service in July 1867. Background Following the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, most regular army troops were withdrawn from the Pacific Northwest for service in the war's eastern theatres. This left Oregon and the Washington and Idaho territories without sufficient troops to guard Native American reservations from trespassing miners, escort immigrant wagon trains, and protect settlers and traders from Native American raiders in eastern Oregon and southern Idaho. Oregon officials were also concerned about possible conflicts between pro-Union and pro-Confederate supporters.Jette, Melinda, \\"Broadside, To Arms!\\", The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, 2003. As a result, the commander of the United States Army's Department of the Pacific, Brigadier General George Wright asked Oregon Governor John Whiteaker to recruit an Oregon cavalry regiment. At the same time, Wright asked Henry M. McGill, Washington Territory's acting Governor, to raise an infantry regiment in Washington. Both recruiting efforts were successful.Edwards, Glenn Thomas, Oregon Regiments in the Civil War Years: Duty on the Indian Frontier, unpublished Master of Arts thesis, Department of History, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, June 1960. The Washington infantry regiment was formed on 18 October 1861, and the 1st Oregon Cavalry was activated a month later on 21 November.Official Army Register of the Volunteer Forces of the United States Army for the Years 1861, '62, '63, '64, '65 (Part VII), Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, California, Kansas, Oregon, Nevada., Adjutant General's Office, Secretary of War, Washington, D.C., 2 March 1865. Formation The initial enlistment period for six of the seven Oregon cavalry companies and five of ten Washington infantry companies expired in the fall of 1864. As a result, Brigadier General Benjamin Alvord, the Army's senior commander in Oregon, asked Oregon's new Governor Addison C. Gibbs to raise a new infantry regiment and recruit backfills for the expected cavalry vacancies. Gibbs agreed, and formally asked Major General Irwin McDowell, who replaced Wright as commander of the Department of the Pacific, to request authority to recruit additional troops for military operations in Oregon. On 31 August 1864, Gibbs and McDowell sent a joint letter to the War Department in Washington, D.C. requesting permission to recruit a new infantry regiment and cavalry replacements. On 20 October 1864, the Governor received a positive reply from the War Department. The news arrived just one day before the end of Oregon's legislative session. Gibbs quickly asked the legislature to provide a $150 enlistment bounty, which the legislators enacted before going home. Governor Gibbs appointed well known civic leaders as county recruiting officers to give prestige to the effort. The state's pro-union newspapers including The Oregonian, the Oregon Statesman, and the Jacksonville Sentinel all encourage young men to join the new regiment. The publicity along with the $150 bounty helped make the recruiting drive a success. The first companies of the 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment were officially activated on 11 November 1864. By June 1865, the regiment reached ten full-strength companies. Three senior officers from the 1st Oregon Cavalry were promoted and placed in charge of the new infantry regiment. Colonel George B. Currey became the regiment's commander. Lieutenant Colonel John M. Drake was second in command, and Major William V. Rinehart was given the third most senior post. Operations Civil War infantry reenactment at Fort VancouverWhile some detachments of the 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment occasionally skirmished with hostile Native American bands, the regiment's main duties were much more mundane. Most companies spent their time in garrison duty at small posts in eastern Oregon, southeast Washington, and southern Idaho. They protected immigrant trails and escorted wagon trains from Fort Boise to the Willamette Valley. Two companies escorted survey parties, and another constructed a road in southwestern Oregon.\\"Oregon History: Civil War in Oregon\\", Oregon Blue Book, Oregon State Archives, Officer of the Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, 5 November 2008. While scouting sixteen miles from Camp Wright on the Selvies River, near present-day Burns, Captain Loren L. Williams and a party of twenty Oregon infantrymen from Company H were ambushed by a band of hostile Native Americans. Williams and his troops fought a harrowing retreat back to Camp Wright, defending themselves for about fifteen hours before they reached safety. All along the way Native Americans fired from concealed positions. At one point, they even set a brush fire in the soldiers path to prevent them from escaping. Despite their continuous attacks, the Native Americans only wounded two soldiers. In his report, Williams stated that his long-range rifles killed fifteen Native American. He also stated that his superior weaponry was the only thing that prevented his party from being overrun. In the summer of 1865, Lieutenant Cyrus H. Walker and the men of Company B were responsible for disarming friendly Native Americans and guarding numerous wagon trains as they crossed southern Idaho. They also established Camp Reed at Salmon Falls Creek and Camp Wallace at Camas Prairie, both in Idaho. The troops built a blockhouse at Camp Wallace, but later abandoned the site in favor of winter quarters near Fort Hall. Lieutenant William Grant and his detachment accompanied David P. Thompson and his government survey team through central Oregon as they plotted the Deschutes Meridian, a north-south line extending from the Columbia River to the California border. In another party, Lieutenant John M. McCall led a detachment of forty-eight men responsible for escorting State Surveyor Byron J. Pengra and his assistants as they surveyed the route of the Oregon Central Military Road. The route they surveyed ran from Eugene, Oregon along the Middle Fork of the Willamette River, through the Cascades near Diamond Peak, then across arid southeastern Oregon to Idaho's mining country. Captain Franklin B. Sprague and twenty men of Company I built a section of road that linked the Rogue River with the John Day road. This connected Jacksonville and southwest Oregon with John Day's mining country. After the construction work was completed, Sprague published a list of the best camp sites along the road in the Jacksonville newspapers so that the wagon masters could find the best water and grass along the way. On 1 August 1865, two hunters from Sprague's party rediscovered Crater Lake, which had been first visited in 1853, but was never effectively recorded so that others could locate the lake. Based on directions from his hunters, Sprague and five other men visited the lake on 12 August. They climbed down the 800 foot caldera cliff to become the first explorers to reach the lake shore. Sprague's account of the visit to \\"Lake Majestic\\" was published in the Jacksonville Sentinel on 25 August.Greene, Linda, \\"Captain Franklin B. Sprague\\", Historic Research Study Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, Cultural Resources Branch, Denver Service Center, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior, Denver, Colorado, June 1984. Civil War era military outposts in the Pacific NorthwestIn the fall of 1865, Colonel Currey was planning a winter campaign against the Native Americans in eastern Oregon. To prepare, he sent detachments of the 1st Oregon Infantry along with Oregon cavalry units to Camp Alvord in the Alvord Valley; Camp Polk near present-day Sisters; Camp Currey near Silver Lake; Camp Logan and Camp Colfax along the Boise Road east of Canyon City; Camp Wallace; and Camp Lander near Fort Hall in the Idaho Territory. Detachment commanders were instructed to build winter quarters at their posts and prepare for a winter offensive. Winter provisions were to follow in supply wagons. However, the end of the Civil War in the east had freed up many regular officers for duty in the west, and as a result, Colonel Currey was released from duty in November 1865 along with the men from companies C, D, and E. Lieutenant Colonel Drake was released from service in December, so the planned winter campaign never got started.Carey, Charles Henry, History of Oregon, The Pioneer Historical Publishing Company, Chicago & Portland, Oregon, 1922, pp. 673-74. Disbanding The remaining companies spent a long winter in field encampments waiting for orders. In February 1866, Major General Frederick Steele arrived at Fort Vancouver to take command of the Military Department of the Columbia. As soon as the weather improved he ordered the dispersed infantry units, except Captain Sprague's Company I, to report to Fort Vancouver where the volunteers were mustered out of service. Several officers were reassigned to regular Army units arriving from the east, but few were retained more than a year. On 19 July 1867, Captain Sprague, First Lieutenant Harrison B. Oatman, and the men of Company I were the last members of the 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment to be mustered out of the Army.

Background In order to trap the Boer guerrillas in the Orange Free State, Lord Kitchener built lines of blockhouses connected with barbed wire. But there was not enough water in the Western Transvaal to employ the blockhouse system. Instead, he unleashed nine columns to hunt down De la Rey and the other Boer commanders in the area. On 24 February 1902, De la Rey pounced on a wagon convoy commanded by Lieutenant Colonel S. B. Von Donop. For the loss of 51 Boers, De la Rey killed, wounded or captured 12 officers and 369 men.Pakenham, p 583 In response, Methuen tried to track the Boer leader down. Battle Canadian Lt T.P.W. Nesham of the Royal Field Artillery, who single-handedly continued firing his gun after his crew was killed at Tweebosch Less than two weeks later, De la Rey ambushed Methuen's column at Tweebosch on the Little Harts River. The British force numbered 1250, including nearly 1000 mounted men and four guns. Methuen's force was largely made up of green troops; these panicked and fled or surrendered. Only the British regulars in the column fought stubbornly in the combat which lasted from dawn until 9:30 am. The British lost 200 killed and wounded, plus 600 men and all four guns captured. After being wounded twice and suffering a broken leg when his horse fell on him, Methuen was captured.Evans, p 155 He was the only general taken prisoner by the Boers during the war. Aftermath De la Rey sent the wounded Methuen to a British hospital in his own carriage under a flag of truce, despite demands from his own troops to execute him. The Boers court-martialed De la Rey for freeing such a valuable prisoner, but after convincing the court that Methuen would withdraw from the war, he was let off. Upon hearing news of the disaster, a badly shaken Kitchener retired to his bedroom for two days and refused to eat. Recovering his poise, he ordered heavy reinforcements sent to the Western Tranvaal and appointed Colonel Ian Hamilton to coordinate the British effort. On 11 April, one of Hamilton's columns beat the Boers at the Battle of Rooiwal. The defeat at Tweebosch had far-reaching consequences. In addition to the 68 killed, 121 wounded and 205 captured (including a general), 6 guns had also been taken and the biggest British force in the Western Transvaal neutralised. Questions were asked in parliament as to why Methuen had not been recalled following his defeat at Magersfontein.Miller, p. 227 On the Boer side, there was a feeling that an honourable end could be found to the war. Metheun escaped with his career intact, with the War Office and Kitchener taking the brunt of criticism for providing him with green troops. On 9 April, Boer and British delegations convened to discuss a negotiated surrender, which was signed on 31 May. References * Evans, Martin Marix. The Boer War: South Africa 1899-1902.

He was best known for overseeing prominent investigations in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, one of which led to the resignation of Premier Bill Vander Zalm. Hughes's wife, Helen Hughes, has been a city councillor in Saskatoon and Victoria.Tom Hawthorn, \\"Stepping up to the podium, two at a time\\", The Globe and Mail, 25 May 2005, S3.

He was an executor of John Diefenbaker's estate, after the former prime minister's death in 1979.Norman Spector, \\"Chairman may exceed what Grits expected\\", The Globe and Mail, 12 January 1999, A5. Hughes stepped down from the bench in 1980, when he moved to British Columbia to become a legal advisor to the provincial Attorney-General. He was appointed as Deputy Attorney-General of British Columbia in 1983,Tonda MacCharles, \\"Judge named to head APEC probe\\", Toronto Star, 22 December 1998, A6; Ian Bailey, \\"APEC curse may have met match\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 December 1998, C11. and chaired a series of public hearings into the government's cuts to legal aid in 1984.\\"Cuts in legal aid will prove costly, lawyers argue\\", The Globe and Mail, 3 April 1984, BC1. Career after 1990 =British Columbia= ;Conflict-of-interest commissioner Hughes was appointed as British Columbia's first Conflict-of-interest Commissioner in 1990. In 1991, British Columbia Premier Bill Vander Zalm was accused of inappropriate behaviour in the sale of his family's Fantasy Gardens theme park, which was purchased by Taiwanese billionaire Tan Yu in 1990. The sale was announced one day after Tan had met with provincial Finance Minister Mel Couvelier in Vander Zalm's office. The premier initially said that he was not involved in either the operation or sale of his family business, but when documents released in a separate court case indicated otherwise, he asked Hughes to investigate the matter. Opposition leader Mike Harcourt was consulted prior to Hughes's appointment, and gave his approval.\\"Conflict probe set over B.C premier\\", Toronto Star, 16 February 1991, A8; Robert Matas, \\"Vander Zalm needn't give testimony on role in sale\\", The Globe and Mail, 15 March 1991, A4; Robert Matas, \\"Agent reviews Vander Zalm deal\\", The Globe and Mail, 18 March 1991, A1; Deborah Wilson, \\"Controversy dogged Premier\\", The Globe and Mail, 30 March 1991, A5. Hughes' report found that Vander Zalm had mixed private business with public responsibilities on several occasions, and had violated provincial conflict-of-interest guidelines. He also indicated that Vander Zalm was apparently sincere, but mistaken, in believing that he had not violated guidelines in arranging Tan's meeting with Couvelier. Vander Zalm resigned as premier after the report was submitted.Robert Matas, \\"Report outlines strange thinking of Vander Zalm\\", The Globe and Mail, 3 April 1991, A4. In 1992, Hughes ruled that Forestry Minister Dan Miller had put himself in a conflict by approving the sale of Westar Timber Ltd.'s forest assets in northwestern B.C. to Repap Enterprises Ltd. At the time, Miller was on a leave of absence from a subsidiary of Repap. He was suspended from cabinet for three months.\\"B.C. cabinet minister ousted over conflict\\", Toronto Star, 18 September 1992, A15. While Hughes's findings were not questioned, some journalists argued that the province's conflict-of-interest rules were defined too broadly after Vander Zalm's resignation, that the sale was a routine transfer, and that Miller did not stand to benefit personally.John Schreiner, \\"Conflict definition has been stretched to the point where it's meaningless in B.C.\\", Financial Post, 18 March 1995, 21. Hughes later investigated Mike Harcourt, who became premier after the 1991 provincial election, over a possible conflict-of-interest involving a former campaign advisor who had started a company called NOW Communications Inc.. The company specialized in social marketing, and received several contracts from the provincial government. Harcourt testified that he played no role in granting the contracts, and the matter ultimately came to nothing.John Schreiner, \\"Conflict definition has been stretched to the point where it's meaningless in B.C.\\", Financial Post, 18 March 1995, 21; \\"Harcourt denies role in contracts\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 March 1995. Hughes briefly resigned as Conflict-of- Interest Commissioner in 1996, following what he described as pressure by Glen Clark, Harcourt's successor as premier. He was reinstated two days later.Craig McInnes and Miro Cernetig, \\"B.C. Premier backs down, reinstates conflict official\\", 30 March 1996, A5. He stepped down from the position in May 1997.Patrick McKinley, \\"Conflict official named\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 May 1997, C6. ;Other matters In September 1992, Hughes issued a report asserting that sexual discrimination against women pervaded every aspect of the provincial justice system, including hiring practices and the handling of sexual assault cases. He said that he was most disturbed by the testimony of sexual assault and family violence victims, and that he was surprised by the extent of violence in British Columbia society.Deborah Wilson, \\"Report flays B.C. justice system\\", The Globe and Mail, 12 September 1992, A1. Hughes chaired a Justice Reform Committee in 1997‚Äì98 that led to significant changes to British Columbia's judicial structure. Hughes also served as chief federal negotiator in talks with ten indigenous groups on Vancouver Island in this period, and was a member of the British Columbia Press Council.Norman Spector, \\"B.C. government dumps hot case on provincial press council\\", The Globe and Mail, 10 November 1998, A13; Ian Bailey, \\"APEC inquiry head well-suited for job\\", The Globe and Mail, 23 December 1998, A6. In 1998, Hughes was appointed to take over an existing inquiry into whether Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers had acted improperly against protesters at the 1997 Asia-Pacific Summit. The inquiry, under the auspices of the RCMP Public Complaints Commission, had previously been led by a three-member panel, which itself became caught up in scandal and controversy. Although some believed the scope of the inquiry was too narrow, Hughes's appointment was welcomed by all parties.Daniel Leblanc, \\"New APEC commissioner welcomed by all sides\\", The Globe and Mail, 22 December 1998, A4. After some delays, he issued his report in August 2001. Hughes found evidence of widespread police incompetence, and wrote that RCMP actions sometimes provoked violence and deprived protesters of their constitutional rights. He concluded that \\"police performance did not meet an acceptable and expected standard of competence, professionalism and proficiency\\", and recommended a series of reforms.Gay Abbate, \\"Mounties assailed for APEC bungling\\", The Globe and Mail, 7 August 2001, A1. Hughes also criticized Jean Carle, a member of the Prime Minister's Office, for \\"throwing his weight around\\" and attempting to interfere with security arrangements.Linda Diebel, \\"Carle a loyal hatchet man\\", Toronto Star, 3 March 2004, A1. The report nonetheless vindicated Staff Sgt. Hugh Stewart, who had been widely criticized for his use of pepper spray against demonstrators. Hughes determined that Stewart made \\"some unfortunate decisions\\", but that he had been placed in a situation \\"that was unfair to him\\".Michael Higgins, \\"'Sgt. Pepper' vindicated in judge's summary\\", National Post, 7 December 2001, A6. RCMP Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli accepted Hughes's finding that the RCMP made errors in planning for the summit.\\"Mounties accept APEC blame\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 September 2001, A14. In 2005, the provincial government of Gordon Campbell appointed Hughes to examine British Columbia's method of reviewing child deaths, following the violent death of an aboriginal girl in foster care.Robert Matas, \\"Panel tapped to examine child death reviews\\", The Globe and Mail, 3 November 2005, S4; Dirk Meissner, \\"B.C. appoints judge alone to review child protection system in province\\", Canadian Press, 18 November 2005, 6:10pm. In his report, Hughes blamed a constant turnover in leadership, major policy shifts, and the Campbell government's budget cuts for undermining the system. He recommended the creation of a new, independent body to oversee provincial child welfare, and advised that the government pay particular attention to the needs of aboriginal communities.Dirk Meissner, \\"B.C.'s child protection system stretched beyond limits, judge wants reform\\", Canadian Press, 7 April 2006, 8:52pm. Hughes added that if the government did not take steps to improve the situation, he would conduct a speaking tour of the province to shame it into action.Dirk Meissner, \\"Judge willing to shame B.C. government over child protection\\", Toronto Star, 8 April 2006, A20. The following month, Attorney-General Wally Oppal tabled legislation to establish a new, independent watchdog organization for children's services.Dirk Meissner, \\"New law to create children's watchdog\\", The Globe and Mail, 5 May 2006, S2. See also Vaughn Palmer, \\"Child, youth overseer gets the Ted Hughes stamp of approval\\", Vancouver Sun, 23 November 2006, A3. In early 2007, Hughes was appointed to a mediation panel looking into lawsuits filed by a group of Indo-Canadian veterinarians, who argued that they had been discriminated against.Nicholas Read and Larry Pynn, \\"Ex-judge in talks to resolve veterinary dispute\\", Vancouver Sun, 5 December 2007, A1. Prior to his death Hughes led a coalition against homelessness in Victoria. He spoke at a drop-in centre in 2008, informing homeless persons of their rights following a court decision that struck down a municipal bylaw against camping in public spaces.Justine Hunter, \\"'I'm trying not to gloat too much'\\", The Globe and Mail, 18 October 2008, A1. =Manitoba= In 1991, Manitoba Justice Minister James McCrae appointed Hughes to lead an investigation into the unusual circumstances which led to lawyer Harvey Pollock being arrested on a dubious sexual assault charge. Pollock had previously acted as the lawyer for the family of J.J. Harper, an indigenous leader who had been killed in a confrontation with Winnipeg police. The case against Pollock quickly fell apart in court, and the woman whose statements led to the charge later clarified that she had never accused Pollock of sexual assault during her discussions with police. Pollock believed that he was the target of a police vendetta.Timothy Appleby and David Roberts, \\"Inquiry to probe Harper lawyer's arrest\\", The Globe and Mail, 3 May 1991, A1; \\"\\"He didn't rape me': Woman stunned by accusation lawyer sexually assaulted her\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 25 June 1991, D9. Hughes' report completely vindicated Pollock and led to the resignation of police chief Herb Stephen.Bruce Owen, \\"Gunsmoke shrouds three dark years\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 September 1991. A serious riot broke out at that Headingley Correctional Institution in 1996, leaving several guards and prisoners injured and the prison itself in ruins. Hughes was appointed to conduct an independent inquiry into the cause of the riot by Rosemary Vodrey, McCrae's successor as Justice Minister.David Roberts, \\"Jail guards in Manitoba return to work after walkout\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 May 1996, A4. Hughes concluded that the prison had been a social powder keg prior to the riot and that morale among prison guards was extremely low. He noted that seventy to eighty per cent of inmates in Manitoba prisons were indigenous and called for a national initiative to target social inequality and other roots causes of crime.David Roberts, \\"Attack roots of crime, report on prison riot urges\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 December 1996, A10. In a subsequent interview, Hughes said that governments should give safety of person and property the same importance as education and health.Alice Krueger, \\"Poor need help: judge\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 December 1996, A5. Hughes led the inquiry into the death of Phoenix Sinclair. He made \\"62 recommendations for improving the child welfare system and is a call out to address 'deeply rooted' issues.\\" He also recommended changes to the provincial school curricula and to programs for supporting those on welfare, among others. The province of Manitoba announced that it had or was planning to implement many of the suggested changes, and issued a formal apology, stating that \\"the child welfare system failed Phoenix Sinclair\\". =Saskatchewan= In 1992, Saskatchewan Justice Minister Bob Mitchell appointed Hughes to lead a judicial review into the shooting death of Leo LaChance, a Cree trapper, by Carney Milton Nerland, a member of the Aryan Nations white supremacist group. Nerland was sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter; many believed that the sentence was inappropriate, and that he should have been charged with murder. The inquiry was permitted to look beyond the shooting, and investigate the activities of racist groups in Saskatchewan.David Roberts, \\"Full-scale inquiry ordered into slaying\\", The Globe and Mail, 4 April 1992, A5. Hughes's report concluded that racism had played a role in LeChance's death, but added that police and prosecutors had acted in good faith and that a murder charge probably would not have been sustained.\\"The tragic death of Leo LeChance\\" [editorial], The Globe and Mail, 23 November 1993, A26. Alphonse Bird, chief of the Prince Albert Tribal Council welcomed the report's findings, but criticized the lack of recommendations.\\"Natives unsatisfied with inquiry report into racist slaying\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 November 1993. During the course of the inquiry, Hughes asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to name an informant who was described as holding a vested interest in the outcome of the inquiry. The RCMP declined, and speculation arose that the manslaughter plea- bargain was arranged to keep the police's spy network in place.Robert Sheppard, \\"What are the real limits of authority?\\", The Globe and Mail, 27 August 1992, A15. Reports later surfaced that Nerland was the informant.Judy Steed, \\"The miracle of Gateway Mall\\", Toronto Star, 9 October 1994, A14. The commission was not permitted to address this subject. =The North and aboriginal conflict resolution= Hughes served as Conflict of Interest Commissioner for the Yukon and the Northwest Territories after 2001.Bill Curry, \\"Experts divided on ethics of conflict solution\\", National Post, 12 March 2003, A7; Lori Culbert, \\"B.C. social worker quits over state of kids' care\\", Vancouver Sun, 3 November 2005, A1. In 2003, Hughes agreed to serve a two-year term as Chief Adjudicator for an Alternative Dispute Resolution process involving survivors of abuse in Canada's residential school abuse.\\"Ted Hughes to head Indian Residential Schools adjudication process\\" [press release], Canada NewsWire, 27 June 2003; \\"Ted Hughes to oversee federal settlements with residential school students\\", Canadian Press, 27 June 2003, 5:16pm. The program was formally launched in November 2003.Campbell Clark, \\"Ottawa launches dispute settlement program\\", The Globe and Mail, 7 November 2003, A10. Critical assessments The Globe and Mail columnist Robert Sheppard once described Hughes as having earned a reputation as \\"a scrupulously fair arbiter for all the tough political cases\\". A political scientist at the University of Victoria wrote that he was sometimes considered to possess \\"the wisdom of a Solomon\\".\\"New year offers fresh start for troubled APEC inquiry\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 30 December 1998, B6. Most other assessments of Hughes agree with this position. One of the few public figures to have criticized Hughes is Bill Vander Zalm, who said in a 1996 interview he believed Hughes had an agenda against him.Stuart McNish, \\"Who's laughing now?\\", Equity, 1 January 1996, p. 1.

It most likely was part of a funerary garment and is more than 4,000 years old, which makes it the earliest gold artifact found in Wales. It was discovered on 16 October 2002 by a team of archaeologists who were investigating the site of Roman and medieval lead smelting hearths below the Bronze Age copper mine on Copa Hill.Ceredigion, A Wealth of History History The area around Cwmystwyth, has been mined for lead and copper for more than 4,000 years, almost since the beginning of metalworking in Britain.sun-disc ‚Äì one of Wales\\"s earliest gold objects Site excavation Excavation now has shown that these mining sites date to the Roman (first century AD) and Early Medieval (ninth to twelfth century AD) periods, but one of the most important finds of the excavation was the gold disc about the size of a milk-bottle top, which pre-dated these discoveries by more than 2,000 years. > At the time of its discovery, it seemed uncertain as to whether the gold > object had ever been intentionally deposited; no earlier archaeological > features were at that time identified, whilst its shallow find-spot > suggested that it had been disturbed and re-deposited some distance > downslope from its original burial context.

Whilst not providing > us with any clear answer, these results do at least support the possibility > of a prehistoric burial. Upon further investigation it was determined that the absence of identifiable skeletal remains and of only a thin film with insufficient collagen, precluded accurate Carbon-14 (C14) dating.Archaeology in Wales Detailed description The disc is 38.9mm in diameter, with a weight of 2.51g, made of a very pure gold that is composed of between 93% and 94% gold, 6% and 7% silver and a negligible amount of copper. It is decorated with concentric line and dot circles and pierced by two central holes, apparently for attachment. The design was determined to belong to the Primary Bell Beaker Goldwork Tradition.Antiquity Vol 78 No 302 December Even though the exact source for the metal cannot be established, the composition appears consistent with that for Irish, Scottish, and Welsh alluvial gold. The disc most likely was made for a funerary garment and possibly, to symbolize the life-giving power of the sun. Further investigation of the discovery site revealed skeletal remains that once were covered over by a mound of stones, known as a cairn. The grave was located within a crescent of boulders and was oriented to look down the valley to the west--a poignant resting place for the person wearing one of Wales's first metal discs derived from native gold. Similar artifacts have been found in Ireland, The Isle of Man, and Brittany. Most known examples of this class of 'sun-disc' have been found in Ireland (21), with smaller numbers from Scotland (6), England (5), and similar examples from France. This is the first example to be found in Wales and thought to be the earliest gold artifact from Wales, probably belonging to the slightly later established Beaker phase (c. 2000 BC). The Banc Ty'ndd√¥l disc most closely resembles an example from Ireland that remains without provenance, having two-four linear circles in repouss√© and two central perforations. A similar style with repouss√© dots is to be found in an example from Kirk Andreas in The Isle of Man. In Brittany, gold discs with similar dot and linear decoration have been discovered in Neolithic tombs and they also appear to be associated with early Beaker (Chalcolithic) abandonment deposits. In Britain, three examples have been found associated with two Beaker burials (one as a pair, and one as a single find) at Mere and Farleigh Wick in Wiltshire. The similarities in style and decorative technique between the Banc Ty'ndd√¥l disc and 'basket earrings' or gold hair tress ornaments associated with rich Beaker burials is striking. Examples from Kirkhaugh, Northumberland had been tooled similarly on the surface as a means of enhancing the repouss√© lines applied to the back, a detail precisely matched on the Banc Ty'ndd√¥l disc. The Kirkhaugh basket earring and other items from similar burial sites can all be dated to the period between 2500-1900 BC. Current status The disc was declared a treasure in December 2003 and has since been acquired by the Amgueddfa Cymru ‚Äì National Museum Wales.

It produces waste treatment plants, industrial plants, precision machinery, industrial machinery, steel mill process equipment, steel structures, construction machinery, Tunnel boring machines, and power plants. Despite its name, Hitachi Shipbuilding no longer builds ships, having spun this business off in 2002. History Hitachi Z≈çsen's origins go back to April 1, 1881, when British entrepreneur Edward H. Hunter established in Osaka to develop the Japanese steel-making and shipbuilding industry. Hunter had come to Japan in 1865 and had established the Onohama Shipyard in Kobe before moving to Osaka and establishing a new shipyard at the junction of the Nakatsu and Aki rivers which could construct ships of under 1000 tons displacement. His first vessel, the Hatsumaru was launched in 1882.Lindberg. Brown-, Green- and Blue-Water Fleets. page 78 Hunter intended to build a company which was completely self- sufficient, and also produced engines, boilers, bridges and irrigation equipment. An additional facility was established downstream on the Aji river at Sakurajima in 1900 to handle construction of vessels larger than 1000 tons. The first oil tanker built in Japan, the 531-ton Tora maru was launched in 1908, for Standard Oil Company.Pederson. International Directory of Company Histories Another shipyard was constructed at Innoshima, Hiroshima in 1911. Hunter changed his name to \\"Hanta\\" in 1915 after marrying a Japanese woman, and after transforming the company into a joint stock company, turned it over to his son, Ryutar≈ç Hanta in 1915. The company continued to prosper, adding the Bing≈ç Dockyard in 1919, Harada Shipbuilding Works in 1920, Hikojima Dockyard in 1924. Many of the iron bridges in Osaka and surrounding areas were designed and built by Osaka Iron Works. The company also began to expand into equipment for hydroelectric power plants in 1924.Pederson. International Directory of Company Histories The company was re-organized in 1934, coming under the overall control of the Nissan zaibatsu, and was renamed as K.K. Nihon Sangy≈ç Osaka Tekkosh≈ç.Inkster. Japanese Industrialisation. Page 124. While most of the lucrative contracts for naval warships for the Imperial Japanese Navy went to Osaka Iron Work‚Äôs competitors, the company did build a large number of smaller auxiliary vessels such as minesweepers, landing craft, transport submarines and was involved in the conversion of old merchant ships for military use. Hitachi Z≈çsen also built the Kumano Maru, a transport aircraft carrier, at its Innoshima works in 1945. During World War II, the Osaka Iron Works expanded by opening a new shipyard at Kanagawa and acquiring the existing Mukaishima shipyard in 1943. It also changed its name to Hitachi Zosen Corporation in 1943. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, under the SCAP's economic democratization policy (dissolution of the zaibatsu and large business enterprises), the company was spun out from Hitachi, Ltd. in 1947. Since then Hitachi Z≈çsen has been independent from Hitachi or the Nissan Group although it is still a member of the Shunko-kai and Shunko Kowa-kai.Organizational Structure Shunko Konwa-kai Hitachi Z≈çsen quickly restarted operations as a builder of fishing vessels and coastal transports. By 1955, Hitachi Z≈çsen had emerged as one of the largest shipbuilders in Japan. The company also expanded into other markets. In 1957, as part of a technical cooperation with B&W; Diesel in Denmark, Hitachi built the world‚Äôs largest diesel engine. It also completed its first turn-key overseas plant project with the completion of a chemical fertilizer plant for India in 1964. In the shipbuilding field, Hitachi began to specialize in ever larger sizes of oil tankers, pioneering in methods for computer assisted design and modular, automated construction techniques. Hitachi acquired another shipyard, Maizuru Heavy Industries, in 1971 and opened a new shipyard at Ariake in Kyushu in 1973. However, the global oil crisis of 1973 with its consequent reduction in ship demand resulted in financial difficulties for the company. Hitachi Z≈çsen, with over 50% of its revenues from ships was hard hit by the cancellation in orders for supertankers and attempted to survive by turning to oil rigs, oil storage facilities, and steel structures, pipes and bridges. However, with rising material costs and losses due to fixed price contracts, high overhead and redundant facilities meant that the company had to restructure from the 1980s. By 1988, the company employed only 5,596 workers, down from 24,660 ten years earlier.Pederson. International Directory of Company Histories The company also made strong efforts to diversify away from the shipbuilding roots, expanding especially into industrial and municipal waste disposal facilities. However, its boldest move was in October 2002, when it sold its shipbuilding operations to a new joint venture with NKK Corporation (now JFE Holdings) called Universal Shipbuilding Corporation (now called Japan Marine United).

The word \\"Nahal\\" (Hebrew: ◊†◊ó◊ú) (acronym of Noar Halutzi Lohem, lit. \\"Fighting Pioneer Youth\\") is an Israel Defense Forces infantry brigade. Historically, it refers to a program created in 1949 to combine military service and establishment of new agricultural settlements, often in outlying areas. Later, the program branched out into volunteering and social welfare projects. The service is divided into several parts: * The military period (◊§◊®◊ß ◊¶◊ë◊ê◊ô) * The national mission period (◊§◊®◊ß ◊û◊©◊ô◊û◊î) * Routine security measures (only for the male members) (◊ë◊ò\\"◊©) * Unpaid military service period (Military service with no payment) (◊©◊ú\\"◊™) The order of the periods is permanent, but there are changes in the length of the periods, in accordance with the recruitment cycles. Also, it is possible to have the unpaid military service period either at the beginning or at the end of each course.https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324161?seq=1  The military period  During the first military period, the members of the Nahal group serve in the Nahal infantry brigade together. The male members have a combat service as part of the 50th battalion or Caracal Battalion, and the female members serve in the Caracal Battalion or in different positions in the Education and Youth Corps and the Nahal headquarters. As part of their service, the members of the same group are entitled to serve in the same military unit (the 50th battalion, in the Caracal Battalion and in basic training of the female soldiers and the non-combat soldiers), and to hold a group meeting once in a while. At the end of their military service, after the release of the female Nahal soldiers, the remaining Nahal members return for half a year of routine security measures activities.  The national mission period  The national mission period lasts a year, in which all the core group stays together, under the command of the Education and Youth Corps. During the establishment of the state, the national mission was mostly the establishment of new settlements in periphery areas (by means of Nahal settlements) and expansion of the existing kibbutzim. Over the years, and in accordance with the changes in the Israeli society, the national mission has changed to helping the poor populations throughout the country and nowadays the Nahal groups perform in the National mission period social and educational-based missions in the social periphery of the state of Israel. The soldiers live in apartments in different local authorities, and work in different education tasks in the schools, in the community centers, in the youth clubs, in the absorption centers, etc. The group is accompanied by Military commanders, the Youth organizers in the local authorities and representatives of the youth movement to which the group belongs to core. The unpaid military-service periods are a remainder of the Nahal course which included living in kibbutzim, but today are more similar to the national mission periods, yet are shorter and are less monitored by the army. In general, the military service of male members of the Nahal group is four months longer than the military service of most soldiers. However, some of the Nahal groups continue to work together, anyway, even after the military service, as part of adult movements or choose to continue living together, regardless of their original movement.  The Orthodox Nahal  Under the Nahal framework, there is now also a route in which soldiers who originate from the Jewish ultra-Orthodox sector could join. They serve for two years in the 97th battalion of the Kfir Brigade, and in addition they go to a one-year school in order to complete their studies and get a matriculation certificate or in order to get a profession.

While his opponent's candidacy was endorsed by the Denver Post, Apuan was endorsed by the Colorado Springs Independent. During the final weeks of the campaign, Apuan was characterized by Roupe in a mass mail advertisement as a \\"violent, anti-war, anti-military protester\\" in reference to his anti-war protest activities, charges Apuan described as \\"totally false\\". House District 17, covering an area southwestern Colorado Springs with a large transient population, including the Fort Carson military base, was seen as a swing district by political observers, and Apuan benefited from Democratic coattails and increased voter turnout to win the seat narrowly, raising more than $40,000 in his campaign. Apuan prevailed by a narrow margin of less than 600 votes, winning just over 51 percent of ballots cast in the race. Roupe was the only Republican in the Colorado House of Representatives to be defeated by a Democrat in 2008. Apuan himself had difficulty casting a ballot in his own race; after first not receiving a mail-in ballot, Apuan was given an incorrect ballot at a polling place on election day. He ultimately was able to cast a provisional ballot in the correct district. During his campaign and after his election, Apuan expressed priorities of small businesses tax cuts, fostering jobs in clean energy, and reducing health-care costs. =2009 legislative session= For the 2009 legislative session, Apuan was named to seats on the House Finance Committee and the House Judiciary Committee.

Although Apuan had hoped to sponsor legislation providing free college tuition to military veterans, state budget constraints led him to instead propose legislation to provide child care for military families. Another bill sponsored by Apuan would provide prospective homeowners with information about future energy bills.

The obituary says Roman died \\"Sunday\\", which was July 2. Biography Roman was born in Szumsk in eastern Poland on September 29, 1914. His father had moved to the United States, intending to bring Herschel and his mother, but they were not able to travel until 1921 because of World War I. After that, he spent his early years in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, then in St. Louis, where they had sent Herschel in advance to provide him with an urban high school education. He enrolled at the University of Missouri in 1932 and, majoring in chemistry and minoring in physics, graduated in 1936. During his senior year, he met Lewis Stadler. For his graduate studies, Roman became Stadler's graduate student and switched to genetics. In 1942 Roman received his Ph.D. in genetics from the University of Missouri, moved to Seattle in September, and joined the faculty of the Department of Botany at the University of Washington, where he stayed for the rest of his career. Around 1944, during World War II, he entered the Army Air Force, became a captain, and then returned to the University of Washington in 1946. He started studying the cytogenetics of maize, experimenting with their supernumerary B chromosomes, but found that the maize with \\"interesting\\" genes were not hardy enough to grow west of the Cascade Mountains. After difficult experiences with growing maize in a greenhouse, going to the California Institute of Technology each summer from 1946 to 1948, and growing corn in Cle Elum, Washington to get east of the Cascades, Roman decided to switch to studying Saccharomyces cerevisiae instead. He invited Carl Lindegren, faculty member at Washington University in St. Louis and the only yeast geneticist in the United States, to visit the University of Washington. From then on, Roman's concentration was on yeast genetics. In 1952 and 1956, Roman spent sabbaticals in Paris working with Boris Ephrussi. The University of Washington established its Department of Genetics in June 1959, with Roman as chairman; he held the seat until August 1980. Roman, who fellow yeast geneticist Geovanni Magni declared to be the \\"Pope of yeast genetics\\", received numerous honors during his career. He was president of the Genetics Society of America in 1968 and received its Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal in 1985, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969 and the National Academy of Sciences in 1970. He also received honorary doctorates from Pierre and Marie Curie University (University of Paris 6) and the University of Missouri. He was also the founding editor of the Annual Review of Genetics. Roman suffered a stroke in January 1976. He remained active in research until his death from stroke at Swedish Hospital in Seattle, Washington, on July 2, 1989, aged 74.

Biography Gilchrist was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1825 to Robert Gilchrist and Frances (Fanny) Vacher. His father served as Clerk of Hudson County from 1840 to 1865 and as mayor of Jersey City from 1850 to 1852. He attended private schools, studied law, and was admitted to the New Jersey Bar in 1847. In 1859 he served in the New Jersey General Assembly.The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans, Vol. 4 (1904). At the first call for troops in the Civil War, Gilchrist enlisted as a Captain in the 2nd New Jersey Regiment, serving from 1861 to 1865. In 1866, he was the Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives in the Fifth District but was defeated by the Republican George A. Halsey. In 1869, Gilchrist was nominated by Governor Theodore Fitz Randolph as Attorney General. He was reappointed for a full five-year term in January 1870. In 1873, Governor Joel Parker appointed him to a commission assigned to revise the New Jersey State Constitution. Gilchrist retired from the position of Attorney General in 1875.Official bio, Office of the Attorney General of New Jersey. After serving as Attorney General, Gilchrist returned to private practice in Jersey City. He married late in life to Fredericka Raymond Beardsley, who wrote The True Story of Hamlet and Ophelia (1889).

All of these proteins have a helical segment (corresponding to B chain in insulin) followed by a variable-length chain, followed by a domain (A chain in insulin) with two helices pinned against each other via a disulfide bond. These two regions are linked by two or three disulfide bonds. Amongst the different proteins in the family, very little of the sequence is conserved except for the disulfide bonds. The variable-length chains may exhibit large inter-species variation even when the remainder of the sequence is highly conserved; and as is in the case of insulin, sometimes the variable length chain is cleaved out by secretory endoproteases, leaving a two-chain protein held together by disulfide bonds.

Cardus made his selection at the request of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for its 100th annual edition published that year.Six Giants of the Wisden Century Neville Cardus, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1963. Retrieved on 8 November 2008. Selection In alphabetical order, the six players selected were: * Sydney Barnes * Don Bradman * W. G. Grace * Jack Hobbs * Tom Richardson * Victor Trumper Alternatives Cardus was aware that any such selection would be controversial, for he wrote: \\"I can already hear in my imagination a thousand protesting voices (including my own)\\". He then named over a dozen other players that he had considered for the honour: * Ranjitsinhji * Fred Spofforth * Wilfred Rhodes * Johnny Tyldesley * Charlie Macartney * Aubrey Faulkner * Bill O'Reilly * Keith Miller * Frank Woolley * Ray Lindwall * Len Hutton * B. J. T. Bosanquet * Bart King Given that Cardus was making the choice, the omission of Rhodes is the biggest surprise. In another place, Cardus has written that he would \\"bend any rule to ensure that Wilfred is in my team\\". Cardus explained that he had looked for more than brilliant batting and artful bowling. He wanted players who, in addition to scoring runs and taking wickets, \\"have given to the technique and style of cricket a new twist, a new direction\\". In other words, he wanted not just great players but creative players (Cardus used the italics himself). Rationale His stated reasons for each of the six choices included the following comments: ;W G Grace :None of these (other great players), not even Sir Jack (Hobbs), dominated for decades all other players, none of them lasted so long. :In a way he invented what we now call modern cricket. His national renown packed cricket grounds everywhere. He laid the foundations of county cricket economy. The sweep of his energy, his authority, and prowess, his personal presence, caused cricket to expand beyond a game. His bulk and stride carried cricket into the highways of our national life. He became a representative Victorian, a father figure. ;Jack Hobbs :Sir Jack is the only cricketer of whom we might fairly say that he directly descended from W.G. armed, like Jove. :I never saw him make an uneducated stroke. When he misjudged the nature of a ball he could, naturally enough, make the wrong right stroke. He not only enlarged and subtilised the art of batsmanship; he, like W.G. widened and strengthened cricket's appeal and history. :...the vintage Hobbs, the Master of our time... ;Tom Richardson :I choose Richardson as one of my Six, not on the supposition that he was the greatest fast bowler of the century, though certainly he was in the running. :I take him as the fully realised personification of the fast bowler as every schoolboy dreams and hopes he might one day be himself. Richardson was, in his heyday, a handsome, swarthy giant, lithe, muscular, broad of shoulder, and of apparently inexhaustible energy. :He was indeed the ideal fast bowler, aiming at the stumps, always on the attack. His leap before the right arm wheeled over was superb in poise. Never did he send down a defensive ball. He would have been too proud. :\\"He tried,\\" A.C. MacLaren told me, \\"to get a wicket every ball. Honest Tom!\\" Let us remember him by those two words of MacLaren's tribute ‚Äì Honest Tom. ;Victor Trumper :It is futile to ask who was the greatest batsman? There are different orders of greatness. Talent, even genius, is conditioned by the material circumstances in which it is developed. :Victor Trumper was the embodiment of gallantry as he made his runs. He was a chivalrous batsman, nothing mean or discourteous in any of his movements or intentions at the wicket. \\"He had no style\\", wrote C. B. Fry of him, \\"but he was all style\\". :But not by counting Victor's runs, not by looking at any records, will you get the slightest idea of Trumper's glorious cricket. You might as well count the notes of the music of Mozart. ;Sydney Barnes :Most cricketers and students of the game belonging to the period in which S.F. Barnes played were agreed that he was the bowler of the century. Australians as well as English voted him unanimously the greatest. :Clem Hill, the famous Australian left-handed batsman, told me that on a perfect wicket Barnes could swing the new ball in and out very late, could spin from the ground, pitch on the leg stump and miss the off. :Barnes had a splendid upright action, right arm straight over. He ran on easy strides, not a penn'orth of energy wasted. He fingered a cricket ball sensitively, like a violinist his fiddle. He always attacked. ;Don Bradman :Sir Donald Bradman (hereinafter to be named Bradman or The Don), must be called the most masterful and prolific maker of runs the game has so far known. He was, in short, a great batsman. Critics have argued that he was mechanical. So is a majestically flying aeroplane. :The difference between Bradman and, say, Victor Trumper as batsmen, was in fact the difference between an aeroplane and a swallow in flight. :Discussing him entirely from the point of view of a writer on the game, I am happy to say that he was for me a constant spur to ideas. A newspaper column couldn't contain him. He was, as far as a cricketer can be, a genius.

Ltd., with illustrations by H. R. Millar and Gerald Spencer Pryse. The stories, previously printed in magazines such as Blackie's Children's Annual, are typical of Nesbit's arch, ironic, clever fantasies for children. The twelve stories: * \\"The Cat-hood of Maurice\\" ‚Äî a boy abuses the family cat, and learns to see things from the feline point of view. * \\"The Mixed Mine\\" ‚Äî two boys find a magic spyglass, and use it to make their fortunes. * \\"Accidental Magic\\" ‚Äî Quentin falls asleep on the altarstone at Stonehenge, and wakes in Atlantis. * \\"The Princess and the Hedge-pig\\" ‚Äî King Ozymandias and Queen Eliza plan a secret christening for their Princess Ozyliza, to avoid a wicked fairy's curse. Things go awry. * \\"Septimus Septimusson\\" ‚Äî he is the seventh son of a seventh son, who can see fairies and hear the beasts speak; and he must seek his fortune. * \\"The White Cat\\" ‚Äî a boy finds a china ornament in the attic; it proves to be a magic talisman. * \\"Belinda and Bellamant\\" ‚Äî they are a princess and prince suffering curses; a talking bat helps resolve their problems. * \\"Justnowland\\" ‚Äî Elsie visits a magic land of giant crows, and a dragon. * \\"The Related Muff\\" ‚Äî a sensitive boy, dismissed as a \\"muff\\" by his cousins, proves himself a hero in a crisis. * \\"The Aunt and Amabel\\" ‚Äî a girl enters a magic world through a wardrobe. * \\"Kenneth and the Carp\\" ‚Äî unjustly accused, a boy transforms into a fish and redeems his honor. * \\"The Magician's Heart\\" ‚Äî an evil magician distributes curses at royal christenings. Complications ensue. \\"The Aunt and Amabel\\" has received attention as a precursor of C. S.

Tolkien.Robert Giddings and Elisabeth Holland, J. R. R. Tolkien: The Shores of Middle Earth, London, Junction Books, 1981; p. 225. Conversely, Nesbit's \\"Justnowland\\" displays the influence of Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice in Wonderland.Carolyn Sigler, ed., Alternative Alices: Visions and Revisions of Lewis Carroll's Alice Books, Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1997; pp. 179 and ff. Elisabeth Beresford's 1964 book Awkward Magic was published in the United States under the title The Magic World. Beresford has been identified as an imitator of Nesbit.John Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, New York, Macmillan, 1999; p. 188. Nesbit's little girls tend to get in trouble over their efforts at gardening. Elsie in \\"Justnowland\\" uproots turnip plants she mistakes for weeds; Amabel cuts chrysanthemum blossoms from a greenhouse and tries to plant them in a flower bed. Stories in the collection feature talking animals and human/animal transformation, with implications regarding animal welfare and avoidance of mistreatment. The opening story is the most explicit in its message against cruelty to animals.For a comparable and contemporaneous parable against cruelty to animals, see L. Frank Baum's 1907 novel Policeman Bluejay. Selected quotes * Dr Strongitharm's was a school for \\"backward and difficult boys.\\" Need I say more? ‚Äî \\"The Cat-hood of Maurice\\" * There is no moral to this story, except...But no ‚Äì there is no moral. ‚Äî \\"The Mixed Mine\\" * But it's no good. King's sons aren't what they used to be. A silly lot they are nowadays, all taken up with football and cricket and golf. ‚Äî \\"Septimus Septimusson\\" * And Sep and his dear Princess are as happy as they deserve to be. Some people say we are all as happy as we deserve to be ‚Äì but I am not sure. ‚Äî \\"Septimus Septimusson\\" * There is nothing more luxurious than eating while you read ‚Äì unless it be reading while you eat. Amabel did both: they are not the same thing, as you will see if you think the matter over. ‚Äî \\"The Aunt and Amabel\\" * We are The People who Understand. And now you are one of Us. ‚Äî \\"The Aunt and Amabel\\" * And the house was surrounded by a real deep moat, with clear water in it, and long weeds and water-lilies and fish ‚Äì the gold and the silver and the everyday kinds. ‚Äî \\"Kenneth and the Carp\\" * And so the story ends with love and a wedding, and showers of white roses. ‚Äî \\"The Magician's Heart\\" References External links * * https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27903 Free downloadable ebook * Category:1912 short story collections Category:1912 children's books Category:Children's short story collections Category:Fantasy short story collections Category:British children's books Category:Works by E.

It is endemic to California, where it is known from fewer than 20 extant occurrences in the hills and mountains surrounding the Los Angeles Basin in Southern California.Topanga Watershed Report accessed 7/4/2010 This is a federally listed endangered species in the United States. Distribution Astragalus brauntonii is a plant of the coastal prairie grasslands, coastal sage scrub, and chaparral plant communities of the region. It is often found growing in disturbed areas, especially in carbonate soils areas.Center for Plant Conservation Profile The 16 known remaining populations are found in the southwestern Transverse Ranges (eastern Santa Monica Mountains, east end Simi Hills, south base San Gabriel Mountains), northern Peninsular Ranges (northwest side Santa Ana Mountains) ‚Äî within Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura Counties.USDA counties distribution map . accessed 1.8.2013 They appear to be extirpated from the southern Channel Islands.https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/Rare_Plants/profiles/TEP/astragalus_brauntonii/index.shtml Description Braunton's milkvetch is a large perennial herb which grows from a woody caudex and reaches up to tall. The thick hollow stems are coated in coarse white hairs. Leaves are up to long and are made up of many pairs of oval-shaped leaflike leaflets. The inflorescence is a dense spike of up to 60 bright lilac flowers. Each pealike flower is about a centimeter long with a reflexed hood. The flowers wither and turn brown but remain on the plant instead of dropping off. The plant is pollinated by native Megachile bees and native bumble bees (i.e. Bombus sp.). The fruit is a small bent legume pod. Fire ecology This plant, like many chaparral species, is fire-adapted and requires wildfire or other disturbance to propagate. The beanlike seeds require scarification to break down their tough seed coats before they can germinate. The seeds persist for years in the soil until fire allows them to sprout, with populations of the plant springing up in an area that has been recently swept by wildfire. It is a pioneer species, one of the first to grow in a disturbed area and one that is soon crowded out by plant species that appear later in ecological succession. Wildfire suppression in the hills and mountains surrounding Los Angeles prevent the plant from reproducing.

Willbanks p.35 The Montigny mitrailleuse was designed to defend narrow defensive positions such as the moats of fortresses. The Belgian army initially purchased Fafschamps volley guns. Only later did they acquire Montigny mitrailleuses. Joseph Montigny also promoted and sold the weapon for offensive field use by placing the weapon on an artillery carriage. Specifications breech before firing. Chinese Qing Empire officers with Montigny mitrailleuse. The weapon consisted of 37 barrels of 11 mm inside a cylindrical protective casing. Loading was performed with a loading plate containing 37 cartridges. It was inserted against the breech in one stroke and locked in with a hinged loading lever attached to the rear of the gun. The ammunition had a brass head and thin rolled brass foil body and was fired by needle pins.An Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology By Ian McNeil, p.985 With the rotation of a crank, all shots were fired simultaneously, although later improvements used a cam which permitted the progressive firing of the 37 shots. Around 150-250 shots per minute could be fired depending on the skills of the operators.A History of Firearms By W. Y. Carman p.84 The whole weapon was very heavy, weighing .

Napoleon III showed personal interest in the mitrailleuse. Montigny had approached the French army for the purpose of a sale.

He was associated with the company Thunes Mekaniske V√¶rksted. Andreas Lauritz Thune Thunes Mekaniske V√¶rksted at Sk√∏yen Biography He was born at Drammen in Buskerud, Norway. His grandfather, Anders Paulsen Thune was a blacksmith by profession who had founded a workshop in that city in 1815.\\"Branntakster forteller industrihistorie\\", Leif Thingsrud. Oslo municipality. The workshop developed to the manufacturing company Thunes Mekaniske V√¶rksted, or Thune for short. It moved to Kristiania (now Oslo) in 1851, with Andreas' father, Halvor Thune (1818‚Äì70), in charge. Andreas Lauritz Thune graduated from Horten Technical College in 1868. He took over Thune in 1871, at the age of twenty-three, following the death of his father. At that time the production facilities were located in the downtown street Rusel√∏kkveien, but Andreas Thune moved to the nearby street Munkedamsveien. He started production of agricultural machinery and steam engines, and locomotive production began in the 1890s. Around the turn of the 20th century Thune became the most important locomotive manufacturer in Norway, along with Hamar Jernst√∏beri og Mekaniske Verksted. Between 1901 and 1920 these two manufacturers delivered about 250 locomotives to the Norwegian State Railways. To allow this kind of production, the production facilities had moved to rural Sk√∏yen, as the locale in Munkedamsveien became too small for large-scale industrial production, and expansion was physically difficult. Andreas Thune had bought the property Kjellebekk, near Sk√∏yen Railway Station, and was personally registered as owner in the 1899 property valuation. Originally using the estate as a country house, he commenced the building of production halls in 1901 and moved in with the company. The next year his son, Sverre Thune (1877-1946), had completed technical studies in Germany and took over management. In 1889 Andreas Thune had been among the founders of the employers' organization De Mekaniske V√¶rksteders Forening. With the Norwegian Union of Iron and Metalworkers, a trade union which is now a part of the United Federation of Trade Unions,United Federation of Trade Unions MVF negotiated Norway's first collective bargaining agreement in 1907. The name was changed to Mekaniske V√¶rksteders Landsforening in 1908, and to Teknologibedriftenes Landsforening (Federation of Norwegian Manufacturing Industries) in 1989. Following a 2006 merger, it is now a part of the Federation of Norwegian Industries (Norsk Industri). Honors Andreas Thune was appointed to Knight of St. Olav's Order in 1889 and Commander of the Order of St. Olav in 1897. He was also commander of the Order of the Dannebrog and the Order of Vasa and holder of the King's Medal of Merit in gold.

Current protests =Bristol Metrobus M32 bus only bridge and junction= On 1 February 2015 the protest group 'RisingUp!' occupied land at Stapleton Allotments and Smallholdings, the planned site for a new motorway bus junction as part of the Bristol Metrobus North Fringe to Hengrove Project (NFHP). Building the junction and associated roads will result in a loss of Green Belt land, loss of long-held allotments (albeit with new laid plots being provided), and loss of smallholdings on some of the best soils in the country. The protesters claim that the junction is unnecessary and that buses could be routed via a suitably modified Junction 1 of the M32 at much less cost and with no loss of valuable growing land. =Central Access Scheme, Kilkenny, Ireland= Kilkenny Central Access Scheme (CAS), previously Kilkenny Inner Relief Road Scheme, is sections of new road, improvement of existing roads and junctions, and a new River Nore bridge crossing, with provisions for footpaths and cycle lanes throughout. CAS comprises 4.5 kilometers of single carriageway road that is 7.3 metres wide. The proposed route dissects the medieval core of the old Irishtown of Kilkenny, one of the most historic quarters of the city. The campaign group called \\"Complete Kilkenny Ring Road as a priority over the CAS\\" or CKRR is holding demonstrations to gain further support for a call to rethink the CAS and demand to complete the outer ring road around Kilkenny. Several of Kilkenny‚Äôs leading figures in the areas of tourism, heritage and archaeology ‚Äì as well as local residents ‚Äì have come out strongly against the imminent demolition of a number of historic buildings and the altering of one of the city‚Äôs oldest streetscapes. =A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton= The Highways Agency wishes to increase capacity on the busy section of the A14 between Ellington and Fen Ditton. to reduce congestion and improve safety The Offords A14 Action Group formed to oppose the proposed route (the Orange route) for the scheme, favouring the Brown route which would have taken the new road further away from their villages. Cambridgeshire County Council have backed the scheme, and there is reported to be widespread support within the local communities for the plans. =A514 Swarkestone Causeway protest= During 2009 a protest group campaigning for a new causeway at Swarkestone, Derbyshire was established.http://www.swarkestonecauseway.webs.com =A57/A628 Mottram in Longdendale, Hollingworth and Tintwistle Bypass= The Highways Agency (HA) have planned to provide a section of bypass (also known as the Longdendale Bypass) to tackle congestions problems in Mottram, Hollingworth, and Tintwistle. and residents of these villages have campaigned for a bypass since the 1970s. Four groups: the Save Swallows Wood campaign, the Friends of the Peak District, the Council for the National Parks, and South Yorkshire group WAIT oppose the scheme, which will pass through the Peak District National Park, and the Swallows Wood nature reserve. In December 2007 the inquiry was adjourned for the fourth time at the request of the Highways Agency who requested time to adjust their correct their traffic modelling, the inspector commented that it was the fifth iteration of the traffic model since the original announcement in February 2006. =Boston Bypass= In May 2007 a single-issue political party, the Independent Bypass Group, campaigning for a bypass to be built around Boston, Lincolnshire, took control of Boston Borough Council. =Norwich Northern Distributor Road= A proposed road scheme to the north of Norwich linking the A1067 road and Norwich International Airport to the A47 has attracted opposition from both local and national groups. =Priory Park, Southend= Southend Borough Council wishes to build road to upgrade A1159/Priory Crescent in Southend in a dual carriageway. The Camp Bling protest camp was established in 2005 and was still active in October 2008 and intending to stay in place until the road is scrapped. At a meeting with the council in April 2009 the authority told the protesters that the road widening scheme had been abandoned and the protesters agreed to leave. =Whaplode and Moulton bypass= In May 2007, the Spalding Guardian reported again that campaigners were calling for a bypass around the Lincolnshire villages of Whaplode and Moulton to be made a top priority. This call followed another fatal collision on the A151 road in Moulton. Measures which have already been taken on the road, including lower speed limits and speed cameras, haven't stopped the increasing death toll. The current campaign to have a bypass built started in 2002. In June 2004 the campaign group WRATH' (Whaplode Residents Against Traffic Horror) was launched to lobby for the bypass. In January 2005 WRATH submitted a proposed route for the bypass to Lincolnshire County Council. In July 2007, WRATH organised a three-mile (5 km) protest march through the villages to publicise their campaign. A Lincolnshire county councillor was reported to have said that there were twenty one other villages in Lincolnshire saying they had a need for a bypass. =Others= Road protest, Bilston Glen, Scotland Other active protests include the ones against the following schemes: The South Bristol Link Road, Weymouth Relief Road, Bilston Glen, M6 widening, Bexhill to Hastings Link Road, Heysham to M6 Link, Kingskerswell Bypass, M1 Widening, Aberdeen Bypass, and the Westbury Bypass. In Ireland there is a protest opposed to bypassing the town of Slane with a new N2 dual carriageway which will pass a few kilometres from the Newgrange ancient monument. Past protests =1950‚Äì1979= =1979‚Äì1997= =1997‚Äìthe present day= A66 Temple Sowerby bypass The bypass around Temple Sowerby opened October 2007. The bypass aims to reduce traffic in the village by 95%. Locals had been calling for a bypass since the 1960s. In 1974 the government announced plans to build one, but these were abandoned in 1983. This was followed by years of increasingly vocal protests. M74 Extension Transport Scotland planned for some time to extend the M74 by five miles to link it to the M8. The M74 Extension, also known as 'M74 Completion' and 'M74 Northern Extension', extended the M74 northwards by through the south-eastern suburbs of Dalmarnock, Polmadie, Rutherglen, Govanhill and the Gorbals to meet the M8 near the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow on an elevated embankment. The Scottish Executive reported that the scheme will lead to a wealthier and fairer, healthier, safer and stronger, and greener future. However, JAM74, a coalition of community, environmental and sustainable transport groups, believed the scheme will be detrimental. In May 2003, the Green and Socialist MSPs joined local campaigners to stop the project. A public inquiry for the scheme ran from December 2003 until March 2004 and the report, not published until March 2005 recommended against the building of the road, saying that it would \\"be very likely to have very serious undesirable results\\". The transport secretary at the time, Nicol Stephen, simultaneously announced that insufficient weight had been given to the economic benefits that the scheme would bring and that they would proceed with the scheme. Friends of the Earth Scotland said that it was \\"probably the worst environmental decision ever taken by the Scottish Executive\\" and that they would challenge the decision in court but then withdrew it in June 2006 on legal advice. In September 2004, the EU ruled that land on which the road was to be built should be classified as hazardous due to chromium dumps buried underground. Construction work started in 2008, and the road opened on 28 June 2011. The extension involved the demolition of the Rosebery Park football ground.

It was independently administered till 1971 after which, between 1971 and 1977, it was combined for administrative purposes with the adjacent village of Vinkem to form a new administrative unit called Beauvoorde. Although Beauvoorde's status as an independent administrative unit was short-lived, the name Beauvoorde continues in daily use. History Wulveringem appears on a map from 1770 on which it is identified as \\"Wulveringhem\\". The village was barely smaller then than it is today. The centre in 1770 comprised approximately 55 buildings, and well beyond the centre there were a number of large and small farms. The land is flat and often damp: about ten of the Wulveringem farms were partially or wholly surrounded by moats. The church and the small cemetery around it were almost wholly circled by a moat as were two adjacent farms. =Population decline since 1830= The registered population peaked in 1830 at 1,080 before the lure if higher wages in the industrializing towns and the mechanisation of agriculture led to a slow decline, to 822 in 1910. The population rose significantly by 1920, but then continued to decline, reaching 508 in 1970 and 336 in 2011. Visiting Wulveringem The centre of the village has been carefully preserved/restored. It is sometimes possible to visit Beauvoorde Castle which is positioned across a moat to the south side of the church yard.

It is managed by Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.  History  Worthing's first hospital was a dispensary created in 1829 in Ann Street. A new dispensary was set up in 1845 in Chapel Road, which when enlarged in 1860 became known as the Worthing Infirmary and Dispensary. The Worthing Infirmary and Dispensary moved to the current site in Lyndhurst Road in 1882 and was given the name Worthing Hospital in 1902. The new East Wing was opened by Princess Anne in 1998. After concerns were raised that the hospital could lose some if its services, a series of marches and protest events were held in both Worthing and Chichester against the plans to downsize facilities. In May 2008, the West Sussex Primary Care Trust Board recommended that Worthing Hospital be the 'major general hospital' for West Sussex and that St Richard's Hospital in Chichester be downgraded. In 2016 Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (WSHFT) was rated as 'Outstanding' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Marianne Griffiths, the Chief Executive, was named chief executive of the year at the Health Service Journal awards in November 2016, and the top chief executive 2018 and again in 2019.

It was an early test of the independence of the Japanese judiciary system and a challenge to the extraterritoriality provisions of the unequal treaties then in force between Japan and the western powers. History On July 9, 1872, the Mar√≠a Luz, a Peruvian cargo ship en route from Macao to Callao, Peru with a cargo of Chinese indentured labourers for Peruvian plantations, called on the treaty port of Yokohama, Japan to repair damage suffered during a severe storm. While anchored at Yokohama, one Chinese coolie aboard escaped by jumping overboard and swimming to the nearby British warship HMS Iron Duke. When he was turned over to Japanese authorities at Yokohama port, he complained about severe mistreatment and asked for protection and the rescue of 231 other Chinese aboard who were suffering from the same fate. The captain of the Mar√≠a Luz, Ricardo Herrera, was summoned by Japanese authorities and strongly admonished to treat the escapee with leniency and to take better care of his indentured charges.Edstrom. Turning Points in Japanese history. page 75-78 However, another Chinese indentured labourer soon escaped, and word reached acting British consul Robert Grant Watson that the first escapee had been brutally treated by the Peruvian captain on his return to the ship. Together with a boarding party of British Marines, Watson personally inspected the vessel, and found that the rumor was true, and that the Chinese passengers were being treated in conditions similar to slavery. Watson formally approached Japanese Foreign Minister Soejima Taneomi to take action. The Japanese government was initially hesitant to take action, as Japan had no formal diplomatic relations with Peru, whose interests in Japan were being handled by the United States. Kanagawa governor Mutsu Munemitsu was strongly opposed to any intervention which might damage Japanese relations with the western nations; however Justice Minister Et≈ç Shimpei felt that the issue could not be ignored for humanitarian reasons. The head of the State Council, Sanj≈ç Sanetomi, authorized Soejima to proceed, and Mutsu resigned his position in protest.Edstrom. Turning Points in Japanese history. page 75-78 Soejima took steps to prevent the Mar√≠a Luz from leaving port, and after reviewing the ship's records and interviewing the officers, found that its cargo of illiterate indentured laborers had been deceived in Macao into signing contracts, the contents of which they could not read or understand, and were being confined against their will under inhumane conditions. Many had been kidnapped, and most had no idea of the location of their final destination. At a preliminary hearing presided over by ≈åe Taku, a court order allowing the Chinese to go ashore at Yokohama was issued, and the court declared that the shipping company owning the Mar√≠a Luz was guilty of wrongdoing. All of the foreign countries represented in Japan at the time were informed of the decision and their opinions were solicited. However, every country with the exception of the United Kingdom responded negatively, charging that Japan had overstepped the bounds of various treaties to rule against a foreign company and foreign captain. In addition, the incident had arisen within the borders of Yokohama, which was at the center of the extraterritorial zone granted by treaty. ≈åe turned to Soejima, who upheld the court's decision despite foreign opposition and charges of lack of jurisdiction, and on August 30, ≈åe ruled that the Chinese labourers were freed of their contracts.Keene, Emperor of Japan: Meiji And His World. pages 216-218 Herrera challenged the decision in an appeal with English barrister F.V. Dickins (who was fluent in classical Japanese and a translator of Japanese poetry) as his legal advisor. Dickins countered with the argument that involuntary servitude was practiced in Japan in the form of the sale of prostitutes and in the contractual debts of apprenticeship, and was thus not illegal. He further charged that since the Chinese labourers had been hired in Macao, the case fell within the jurisdiction of Portugal due to extraterritoriality agreements between Japan and Portugal, and was supported in this stance by letters from the Portuguese ambassador to Japan.Edstrom. Turning Points in Japanese history. page 75-78 However, Dickens' arguments were not accepted by ≈åe, and he lost in a court decision on September 26, with the Japanese judge ruling that the Peruvian captain and contractor were in violation of international law, and not Japanese law. After the ruling, Herrera fled from Yokohama to Shanghai on another vessel, abandoning the Mar√≠a Luz at Yokohama. The Qing dynasty Chinese government issued an official letter thanking the Japanese government for its strong stance and assistance rendered to Chinese subjects; however, most European nations remained displeased with the court rulings, and supported official diplomatic protests from the Peruvian government. In June 1873, the Japanese government requested that Tsar Alexander II of Russia arbitrate the issue as a neutral party, and in 1875 he confirmed Japan's position.Keene, Emperor Of Japan: Meiji And His World. pages 216-218 Significance The Mar√≠a Luz Incident was a diplomatic victory for Japan in asserting itself against the unequal treaties. The outcome of the incident accelerated the decline of the \\"coolie trade\\" in Peru and elsewhere. In Japan, the incident also led to new legislation in late 1872, emancipating burakumin outcasts, prostitutes and other forms of bonded labor in Japan.Downer, Women of the Pleasure Quarters. page 97 See also *Terashima Munenori, key negotiator for Japan during the incident *≈åe Taku, judge of the management of foreign affairs at the port of Yokohama *Soejima Taneomi, foreign minister during the affair *Chinese Peruvian *Japan‚ÄìPeru relations  Reference and further reading   External links * \\"Freedom without slavery?

He founded the Hongcheng Magic Liquid company with funds from Chinese governmental agencies and other supporters, raising a total of 300 million yuan (US$37 million), but no product was ever released. Around that time, in 1994, the Chinese Government, alarmed by an increase in pseudoscience and superstitions since the death of Mao Zedong, made a declaration decrying the deterioration of science education in the country, taking several measures to improve science education and to improve the prevalence of science and technology in courts. One of these efforts was to require the scientific authoritative journal Science and Technology Daily to carry an article critical of Hongcheng's invention, which had been previously rejected at several major Chinese publications. This created a growing publicity and opposition of Hongcheng's invention, silencing his supporters. In 1995 Hongcheng refused an invitation to carry out a scientific appraisal of his invention at Beijing, and the notable scientist and debunker He Zuoxiu and 40 other scientists made a statement calling for the Chinese Government to investigate his claims. Hongcheng was eventually arrested, put to trial, and in 1998, was found guilty of fraud and deceit and condemned to 10 years of prison. Invention and initial experiments Wang Hongcheng was a bus driver from Harbin, a former soldier with ninth-grade educationMeaning that he was schooled until the age of 14 or 15 years old. The magazine stating this is from the US, \\"ninth-grade\\" in the US corresponds to the first year of High school and no scientific training. In 1983 he claimed that he invented a liquid that could transform a liter of regular water into a fuel by simply adding two or three drops of his liquid, and that this resulting fuel was as combustible as petrol. Hongcheng called it \\"the fifth greatest invention of China\\", in a reference to the four Great Inventions of China, and his invention became more popular, finally reaching on 28 January 1993 the front pages of a major national newspaper. In the winter of 1985, Wang showed this technique in Beijing, Hebei, Zhejiang and Shanghai. Hongcheng Magic Liquid company The Chinese security and military departments started to look into his claims and funded his research.From a Carl Sagan article, the same text also appeared verbatim in his book The Demon-Haunted World *Does truth matter? , by Carl Sagan, pages 8‚Äì9 * In 1992‚Äì1993 Hongcheng founded a company called Hongcheng Magic Liquid to manufacture his product and raised a total of 300 million yuan (US$37 million). No product, working or otherwise, was ever commercially released. Chinese Government reaction and repercussions In 1994 the Chinese Government was alarmed by a recent raise in pseudoscience and a revival of old superstition, and issued a declaration declaring the rise of superstition and ignorance, how the science education had declined among the population, and how it would make efforts to combat this situation. After this declaration, Song Jian, then chief director of the Chinese National Science Committee, held a conference on how to carry this work among the public. Song Jian was then told at the conference was that an article debunking Hongcheng's invention had been refused publication in three major national newspapers and one scientific publication. Song Jian then required Science and Technology Daily, the most authoritative newspaper in China's science and technology,Science and Technology Daily chinaculture.org to publish it. This publication explained that when Hongcheng's invention hit newspaper front pages in 1993, different newspapers reported different proportions of oil and water in their announcements, and used this to make a critical analysis. It publicized the invention, started an opposition feeling, and silenced Hongcheng and their supporters. Fraud conviction After the public backlash caused by He Zuoxiu's article, the Chinese people started to realize that Hongcheng's \\"technique\\" was a fraud. Hongcheng faced growing criticism from scientists and media. He Zuoxiu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as well a notable scientist and debunker, had been invited several times by Hongcheng's supporters to visit the northeast and watch his invention in action. In 1995, Zuoxiu asked them to Beijing to pass a scientific appraisal of his liquid, as the country capital would be a proper place for such a scientific and universal invention. Hongcheng refused, prompting Zuoxiu and a group of other 40 scientists to ask the top Chinese legislative body, the People's Political Consultative Conference, to investigate his claims. After this declaration, his invention collapsed by itself, and it was finally found that it was a fraud. In 1998 he was found guilty of fraud and deceit and sent to prison for 10 years (online translation ) Hongcheng acquired the status of a legendary figure, because some people thought that it was a case of cover-up or of free energy suppression, where he would be imprisoned not because his formula would not really work, but because of refusing to release his secret formula to the government. Political and cultural context The Chinese Government were alarmed by this and other similar cases of promotion of pseudoscience even before Hongcheng's refusal to carry a scientific appraisal at Beijing and the publicity it carried. The Chinese government decided to tighten the appraisal system for scientific claims and other measures like creating science and technology courts. After the death of Mao Zedong, several Western pseudoscience theories appeared in rural areas, together with the return to ancient China practices like ancestor worship, astrology and fortune telling. The government newspaper had lamented \\"the superstition of feudal ideology is raising again in the Chinese countryside\\".The effects of the recent Cultural Revolution had caused almost a generation to receive incomplete or no education, had reduced the literacy rates severely, and had killed or driven away many intellectuals. Individual claiming to have \\"special powers\\" claimed that they project their Qi out of their body to cure people, and called \\"masters of Qi Gong\\", one of them being arrested after causing the death of several patients. The Asian Rhinoceros was being driven to extinction because pulverized Rhinoceros horn were said to prevent impotence, despite the fact that Rhinoceros horn is composed of keratin, the same substance that is present in human hair and fingernails. To address all these issues, the government of China and the Chinese Communist Party made on 5 December 1994 a joint public declaration called \\"Some Suggestions on How to Reinforce the Popularization of Science\\". In it they lamented the recent withering of public education and the growth of pseudoscience and anti-science ideas, and then indicated that they would reinforce the public education about science. hosted at facts.org Most officials support the effort to root out pseudoscience in China, although the government still sends occasionally mixed signals, like one incident when a high-ranking official ordered the Guangming Daily to pull a letter critical of Hongcheng at the last minute. He Zuoxiu explains that corruption will also have to be fought at the same time as pseudoscience, since some officials and journalists may \\"have a stake\\" in these inventions, and would be harmed by their exposure.

He has made a signal contribution to knowledge and understanding of sixteenth- century Italian art, devoting most of his scholarly publications to the life and works of Michelangelo. His studies of the Florentine master have shaped a generation of art historians and constitute a point of reference for Renaissance art history in general. His book on Michelangelo‚Äôs drawings is widely considered to be the most perceptive study on the subject thus far. Hirst‚Äôs monograph on Sebastiano del Piombo is also fundamental in the field.

They became known for tackling political issues including racism, homelessness and contemporary drug culture. v Spy vs Spy: 1981-2003 Spy vs. Spy played their first show in 1981. The band developed an enthusiastic pub following for their distinctive brand of ska-flavoured indie rock. They performed at many Sydney venues, particularly at the Sydney Trade Union Club, often supporting INXS. They also supported The Clash at the Capitol Theatre and U2 at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. They were then taken under the wing of Gary Vasicek, the manager of Midnight Oil and toured consistently around Australia, with forays to England, Germany and two tours of Canada.

Hoff wrote that, \\"There can be no doubt about it, this album is going to offend, shock, worry and disgust some people.\\" In reference to the lyrics, he promised they would, \\"...smack you straight between the eyes and tell it as it is.\\" For example, \\"Dr Hatchet\\" is a song which accuses those in the medical profession who perform abortions of being cold-blooded murderers. According to Hoff, the song caused \\"much controversy amongst certain so-called Christian event organizers.\\" Musically, Hoff felt that the only thing that needed criticism was Ian Arkleys vocals: \\"These are excellent for the thrash numbers, but unlike his guitar work, lack the range, imagination and musicality to cope with a track like 'Katie' where some real vocal dexterity is called for, Ian sounds more like he's talking or doing a 'Make Way' chant than singing.\\" After the release, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph wrote that Seventh Angel is one of England's leading Christian thrash metal bands.Bolton, Nick. The Torment (albumin sivuviitteet). Retroactive Records. 2006. The Torment achieved notable mainstream distribution. Later, Ian Arkley has stated in interviews that he regrets the album's lyrics because he was \\"young and reckless\\" at the time he wrote them. Eventually, the lyrical style would become more subtle on the second album Lament for the Weary. Tour During the months following the album's release, the band played concerts in Dudley and Stourbridge, 5 times in Brierley Hill's The Rock Tavern club. In November 1990, Seventh Angel headlined Metal Meltdown festival. In February 1991, Seventh Angel appeared on BBC TV four times with video material recorded at Metal Meltdown festival. \\"Forbidden Desires\\" was the selected song.

Early life Umberslade Hall Archer was baptized on 2 August 1659, the eldest son of Thomas Archer of Umberslade, Warwickshire and his wife Anne Leigh, daughter of Richard Leigh of London. His father had been a parliamentary commander during the Civil War. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 3 May 1678, aged 18; and was admitted at Inner Temple in 1680. Upon his father's death in 1685 he inherited Umberslade. He married Elizabeth Dashwood, daughter of Sir Samuel Dashwood by licence of 15 June 1693. His wife was connected to Fulke Greville, 5th Lord Brooke, a leading Warwickshire Tory. and the marriage brought him into contact with the world of finance. Career Archer was returned in a contest as Member of Parliament for Warwickshire at the 1690 English general election but was relatively inactive. He became a Commissioner for rebuilding Warwick in 1695 and was returned in a contest again at the 1695 English general election. At first he refused to subscribe the Association. He voted against fixing the price of guineas in March 1696, and voted against the attainder of Sir John Fenwick on 25 November 1696. In 1697, he introduced and managed a bill to empower magistrates to order that highways be widened. He did not stand at the 1698 English general election and spent the next few years to 1700 rebuilding Umberslade. In 1700 he became deputy lieutenant. He maintained his interest in political affairs in London and Warwickshire, but did not stand for Parliament again until asked to fill the gap at a by- election for Warwickshire on 28 November 1705. He was returned unopposed as a Tory and was active in Parliament. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned unopposed as Tory MP for Warwickshire. He was a teller for the Tories on several occasions and saw through a bill for a new church at Birmingham. He was active in the matter of Dr Sacheverell and voted against the impeachment proceedings in 1710. He decided not to stand at the 1710 British general election, but in 1711 was appointed Commissioner in the inquiry into forces and garrisons in Spain, Portugal and Italy. He spent two years in constant travel and uncovered many fraudulent practices in Spain. However he felt his efforts were unappreciated and was disappointed to receive no reward. At the 1713 British general election he was invited to stand by the Warwickshire gentry and was returned unopposed as Tory MP for Warwickshire again. He was teller for the Tories a few times but was noted as voting with the Whigs on occasion. Archer was returned again at the 1715 British general election, and supported the opposition until he stood down at the 1722 British general election. Later life and legacy Archer became increasingly indebted, having borrowed to purchase another manor in 1716. He appeared to have devoted his efforts to building a library. He died on 31 December 1741 at Umberslade. His children were: *Diana Archer, who married Thomas Chaplin *Thomas Archer, 1st Baron Archer (1695‚Äì1768)thepeerage.com *Henry Archer (1700‚Äì1768), married Elizabeth Montagu, sister of George Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax *Anne Archer *Elizabeth Archer *Sarah Archer Archer's sons Thomas and Henry were both returned to Parliament in 1735.

Categories Currently hedge funds in China fall into two categories. One is those companies backed up by the government, including brokers managing pooled property, trust and investment companies' trust and investment projects, and investment companies managing their own capital. The other is private hedge funds. Under the name of \\"Investment Consulting Company\\" or \\"Investment Management Company\\", they provide management for pooled property. Economic growth trend Against the background of China's fast growing economy, the number of hedge fund investors is increasing rapidly in the country, and the total amount of their wealth is increasing in step. By the end of June 2008, China's residents had RMB 19,460bn ($2,820bn) in bank deposits, of which 80% was in the name of 20% of the population. With such a huge amount of cash assets in hand, the wealthy's strong investment demand has provided hedge funds in China with a sufficient supply of capital. In addition, China's companies also have a huge sum of spare cash, which is also a primary source of capital for hedge funds. Share of GDP Data showed that hedge funds account for 0.6% of the GDP in the USA, 0.35% in Europe, 0.2% in Asia, while only 0.1% in China. It is expected that China's GDP would quadruple in 10 years time and hedge funds would be about 0.4% of the country's GDP. In this case, China's hedge funds would expand 12-fold, and place China second in the world for hedge fund investments. =Bank deposits= Residential Bank Deposits in China 2003-2008H1 Year Residential Bank Deposits in China (billion RMB) *2003 10,360 *2004 11,960 *2005 14,110 *2006 16,160 *2007 17,250 *2008H1 19,460 See also *Chinese Stock Exchanges *Commodity trading in China *Banking in China *Financial services in China *China Venture Capital Association  References  Category:Industry in China Category:Finance in China China ","title":"Hedge fund industry in China"},{"id":"20121408","text":"A Queen Is Crowned is a 1953 British Technicolor documentary film written by Christopher Fry.

Persoon joined it with > Swartz's Ceph√¶lis, the Tapocomea of Jean Baptiste Christophore Fus√©e Aublet > and Bernard de Jussieu; but Mr. Brown not finding it to accord with any > established genus, has considered it as distinct from any, and given it the > name of Burchellia in honour of Mr. Burchell, a very enterprising traveller > in Southern Africa, who has favoured the public with an interesting account > of his travels in that country.

Emergence  The DB Museum, Koblenz, is housed in the former goods wagon repair shop (Ausbesserungswerk) in the Koblenz district of L√ºtzel. The site was built in 1905 as part of the rebuilding and expansion of L√ºtzel goods station into the Koblenz-L√ºtzel locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk). Originally the facility included a large roundhouse with two turntables, where the goods locomotives were stabled, as well as a wagon shed in which goods wagons were repaired until 1995. Today it accommodates the vehicles belonging to the DB Museum at Koblenz. The old Bahnbetriebswerk was dismantled bit by bit up to the early 1980s.  Exhibits  Various exhibits are displayed on the open part of the site. The museum's collection of vehicles includes more than 20 locomotives and wagons. The central themes of the exhibitions are electric trains and travelling by rail. In addition to the exhibits of actual vehicles, these themes are expanded by means of photographs, pictures and models in the museum rooms.  Other facilities Books, model railway items and other gifts with a railway theme may be found in the small shop at the entrance.

His arms are blazoned: Azure three arrows or.Landed Families of Britain and Ireland: Archer of Umberslade and Hale, Barons Archer, accessed 28 Nov 2016. Like his father, he expanded the family estate. He was knighted on 21 August 1624 at Warwick Castle.Knights of England In 1626 Archer was appointed High Sheriff of Warwickshire and, in April 1640, elected as Member of Parliament for Tamworth in the Short Parliament. He remained neutral in the English Civil War in 1642, but two of his sons fought on the Parliamentary side. From 1644 he himself served on the parliamentarian subcommittee for accounts in Warwickshire, which served as a curb on the more militant members of the county committee. In the 1650s, he was active as a Justice of the Peace in local government, and (unusually) retained this office after the Restoration, until his death. In 1654 he purchased the Jury Street House in Warwick as his town residence.History of Warwick Pubs, by John Crossling, accessed 28 Nov 2016. In 1694, it was the 0.5 metre thick stone walls of Jury Street House that prevented the Great Fire of Warwick, which destroyed the town's centre, from progressing down Jury Street to the half-timbered houses beyond. In the 18th century the town centre was rebuilt in Georgian style, and his descendants constructed the Georgian frontage that Jury Street House has retained to the present, originally with the family coat of arms at the apex. His main claim to fame was as an antiquary, starting work on the history of his native county in the 1630s. William Dugdale was initially his assistant, but when Archer became more involved in public affairs, Dugdale took over the lead, resulting in the publication in 1656 of Dugdale's Antiquities of Warwickshire, with an acknowledgement to Archer's work in the dedication. He married Anne, daughter of Sir John Ferrers of Tamworth Castle. He was succeeded at Umberslade Hall by his second son Thomas. His great-grandson, another Thomas was created Baron Archer in 1747.'Parishes: Tanworth', Victoria County History, Warwickshire 5: Kington hundred (1949), pp. 165‚Äì175. , accessed: 8 November 2008.

The genealogy presented by Snorri begins with Priam. Priam's daughter Tr√≥√°n married king M√∫n√≥n or Menn√≥n. Their son was Tr√≥r, or Thor, who was fostered in Thrace. Thor slew his foster father and married Sibil, identified with Sif. The line of descendants of Thor and Sif is given as follows: : L√≥ri√∞i, Einridi, Vingethor, Vingener, M√≥da, Magi, Seskef, Bedvig, Athra, √çtermann, Herem√≥d, Skjaldun, Bj√°f , J√°t, Gud√≥lfr, Finn, Fr√≠allaf Finally, the son of Fr√≠allaf was \\"V√≥den, whom we call Odin\\", who came to Germany (Saxland) and established the royal lines there. :\\"Odin had second sight, and his wife also; and from their foreknowledge he found that his name should be exalted in the northern part of the world and glorified above the fame of all other kings. Therefore, he made ready to journey out of Turkland [...] They made no end to their journeying till they were come north into the land that is now called Saxland\\" In Saxland, Odin's sons Vegdeg, Beldeg (Baldr) and Sigi founded the ruling houses of the Franks, from whom descended the V√∂lsungs. Odin himself moved on to Jo√∞land, which Snorri tells was known as Rei√∞go in earlier times, where he established his son Skj√∂ldr, from whom derive the Skj√∂ldungs, the kings of the Danes. After this, Odin went on to Sweden, where there was a king named Gylfi. Old Sweden, Svi√æjo√∞, is otherwise attested by Snorre to stretch from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea and modern Sweden, along the river Tanais, Dniepr. King Gylfi welcomed Odin and his train as \\"men of Asia, who were called √Üsir\\". In Sweden, Odin founded a city called Sigt√∫na as a Trojan colony. Later, Odin's son Yngvi became king of Sweden, founding the Yngling dynasty. Finally, Odin went on to Norway, where he established his son S√¶mingr as king. The Prologue concludes in a linguistic remark, observing that the √Üsir when they came to the north, spread out until their language was the native language over all these lands. Snorri's genealogy is obviously informed by Anglo-Saxon tradition, as preserved by √Üthelweard, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Anglian collection. His genealogical descent from Seskef to Odin directly parallels that from Sceaf to Woden in Anglo-Saxon tradition, and Snorri explicitly gives Odin's original name as V√≥den, explaining that the original names of the √Üsir were better preserved in England. The specific form that the names take as well as retained errors in the ancestry of Odin indicate a source closely related to Anglian collection manuscript T. Snorri's Sescef matches this manuscript's Se Scef - 'this Scef', and he appears to have had used a set of genealogical notes made from the Anglian collection manuscript and brought to Iceland, where they would serve as the basis for his expanded account in the Prologue as well as specific passages within Heimskringla. These notes omitted the descent from Adam given Scef in the Anglian collection, freeing Snorri to derive his Sescef from Thor and hence Priam. The names interposed are all associated with Thor: L√≥ri√∞i, Einridi, Vingethor and Vingener derive from alternative names for Thor, while M√≥da and Magi are his sons M√≥√∞i and Magni.Faulkes, Anthony. \\"The Genealogies and Regnal Lists in a Manuscript in Resen's Library\\", Sj√∂t√≠u ritger√∞ir helga√∞ar Jakobi Benediktssyni 20. j√∫l√≠ 1977, Reykjavik, 1977, pp. 170‚Äî190Faulkes, Anthony. \\"The Earliest Icelandic Genealogies and Regnal Lists, The Saga Book of the Viking Society, vol. 29 (2005), pp. 115-119 . Snorri emulated the Anglo-Saxon pedigrees that converging on Woden, making the Scandinavian pedigrees converge on Odin by turning their eponymous founders, Yngvi of the Ynglings and Skj√∂ldr of the Skj√∂ldungs, into Odin's sons. In so doing, he creates a duplicate of Skjaldun, intermediate between Seskef and Odin in the portion of the pedigree derived from the Anglo-Saxon source, and representing the same Scyld. Regarding the euhemerization in the Prologue, Faulkes (1985) commented that \\"undoubtedly one of the motives for including the prologue, and maybe the chief reason for the use of the frame device itself, was to avoid the criticism that his stories were dangerous to [Christian] orthodoxy\\".Faulkes (1985:284-285).

Neopaganism in Hungary (Hungarian: √öjpog√°nys√°g) is very diverse, with followers of the Hungarian Native Faith and of other religions, including Wiccans, Kemetics, Mithraics, Druids and Christopagans.Kolozsi 2012, p. 57 Szil√°rdi (2006) describes the movement as a postmodern combination of ethnocentric linguistic, national, religious and occasional political patterns of identity. Interest in the reconstruction of an ethnic religion for the Hungarians manifested for the first time in the early 20th century.Koloszi 2012, p. 36-53 A contribution to the popularisation of Pagan ideas in the Hungarian society was the tremendous success of the rock opera Istv√°n, a kir√°ly in 1983.Rabinovitch and Lewis 2004, p. 183 Religions =Christopaganism= Many Pagan groups in Hungary make use of Christian terminology and iconography re-interpreted in an ethnic Pagan way. This is the case of the \\"Church of Esoteric Beliefs ‚Äî Church of the Holy Crown\\" (Hungarian: Ezoterikus Tanok Egyh√°za ‚Äî Szent Korona Egyh√°z), conceptualising a Scythian ancient religion with Christian character, worshiping the F√©ny J√©zus (\\"Light Jesus\\") and the Boldogasszony (\\"Blessed Lady\\"), with the t√°ltos as priests.Kolozsi 2012, p. 80 The church has been establishing naptemplomok (singular: naptemplom), \\"temples of the Sun\\", as its places of worship. Another organisation of this kind is the \\"Our Lady's Love Church\\" (Nagyboldogasszony Szeretet Egyh√°z). =Hungarian Neopaganism= Hungarian Neopaganism, the Hungarian native faith, or ≈êsmagyar Vall√°s (meaning \\"Ancient Hungarian Religion\\" or more accurately \\"Arch-Hungarian Religion\\") as it is called in the local Neopagan discourse, defines the movements which seek to rebuild a purely Hungarian ethnic religion, inspired to Hungarian mythology and folklore. This drift has roots in the ethnological studies of the early 20th century, while the elaboration of a national Hungarian religion was endorsed in the interwar Turanist circles (1930s-40s), finally blossoming alongside other Pagan religions since the fall of the Soviet Union.Kolozsi 2012, p. 36-62 The difference between Hungarian Neopagan groups is often determined by their differing ideas about the historical origins of the Hungarians.Kolozsi 2012, p. 66 The development of the Hungarian Neopagan movements largely rely on the work of individual shamans or neoshamans, the t√°ltos, who may organise themselves in associations, set up schools, or establish larger religious organisations.Kolozsi 2012, p. 36-62 The shamans' movement started to come to light in the 1980s, organising cooperation with representatives of core shamanism from the United States since 1986.Kolozsi 2012, p. 42 Those t√°ltos who espouse a Turanist ideology often choose to affiliate with Tengrism.Kolozsi 2012, p. 62 The most important organisations of this kind are the Yotengrit, and the ≈êsmagyar T√°ltos Egyh√°z (\\"Arch- Hungarian T√°ltos Church\\") founded by Andr√°s Kov√°cs-Magyar, who later also founded the T√°ltos Iskola (\\"T√°ltos School\\").Kolozsi 2012, p. 59 Other groups of this stream are the ≈êsmagyar Egyh√°z (\\"Arch-Hungarian Church\\") and the Magyar Vall√°s K√∂z√∂ss√©ge (\\"Community of Hungarian Religion\\").Kolozsi 2012, p. 59 Another church of the Hungarian native faith is the √Årp√°d Rendj√©nek Jogalapja Tradicion√°lis Egyh√°z (\\"Traditional Church of the Order of √Årp√°d\\"), founded in 2009. It is inspired by the Traditionalist School, the Nouvelle Droite of Alain de Benoist, and to the concept of a common Indo-European paganism.Kolozsi 2012, p. 60 =Kemetism= The \\"Ankh ‚Äî Church of Eternal Life\\" (Hungarian: Ankh ‚Äî Az √ñr√∂k √âlet Egyh√°za) is a Kemetic church in Hungary, founded in 1999. They propose a theory that sees God as the source of the universe, himself being the universe, inclosing every conscious and unconscious being. The aim of the organisation is to cultivate and meet the gods, who are the powers acting in the creation. =Neo-Mithraism= The Sodalitas Mithraica (Latin for \\"Mithraic Fellowship\\") is a Neo-Mithraic group active in Hungary.Kolozsi 2012, p. 57 =Wicca and Witchcraft= Magyar Boszork√°nysz√∂vets√©g (meaning \\"Hungarian Witchcraft\\") is a Budapest-based Neopagan organization formed in 1986. Wicca, a religion of English origin, has spread to Hungary as in the other countries of Western Europe. Zsuzsanna Budapest, a Hungarian who emigrated to the United States, is the founder of the Wiccan denomination known as Dianic Wicca, popular in North America. The Celtic Wiccan Tradition Church (Kelta-Wicca Hagyom√°ny≈ërz≈ëk Egyh√°za) is a Celtic Wiccan church in Hungary.

The construction of a national Hungarian religion was endorsed in interwar Turanist circles (1930s‚Äì1940s), and, eventually, Hungarian Native Faith movements blossomed in Hungary after the fall of the Soviet Union. The boundaries between Hungarian Native Faith groups are often traced along their differing ideas about the ethnogenetic origins of the Hungarians, which have historically been a matter of debate. Many organisations acknowledge the commonly accepted theory that Hungarians originated among the Finno-Ugric peoples. Other Hungarian Native Faith groups, however, cultivate further links with Scythian, Sumerian, Turkic and other cultures. Besides the elaborations developed within intellectual circles, the grassroots development of the Hungarian Native Faith largely relies upon the work of individual shamans or neoshamans, the t√°ltos, whom have become popular in Hungary since the 1980s. Some Hungarian Native Faith organisations are supported by political parties of the right-wing, including Fidesz and Jobbik.

This search for the origins of the Hungarians has continued to be productive well into the twentieth century, especially as a means to build a strong national identity. According to scholars, this search was fueled by the experience of the Hungarians under foreign powers, namely the Austrian and Soviet dominations. The theme of a national Hungarian religion was also dear to Hungarian Turanist circles in the 1930s and the 1940s, who looked for evidences to demonstrate a kinship between the Hungarian and Turkic peoples, and generally the origins of these \\"Turanian\\" populations in Central Asia. The Protestant priest B√©la Murak√∂zy, writing in 1921, forebode that Turanism, with its anti-Western slants and its fascination with the Orient, would have taken a religious direction trying to resurrect \\"ancient paganism\\". When Hungary was occupied by Soviet forces in 1945, many Turanists emigrated to Western countries and continued to work there on their ideas, to reintroduce them to Hungary starting in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Theories about Scythian and Sumerian origins were supported by many Turanist ethnologists. At the turn of the twentieth century, the first to popularise the notion of a Turanian linguistic family inclusive of Hungarian and Sumerian was Gyula Ferenczy. In the post-war period, a direct filiation of the Hungarians from the Sumerians was theorised by Tibor Bar√°th, Victor Pad√°nyi, Andr√°s Zakar, and especially Ida Bobula, though the most well-known supporter of the theory is Ferenc Badinyi-J√≥s, who emigrated to Argentina, according to whom the original undivided Sumerian- Hungarian ethnicity was based on the Carpathian Mountains. The theory has left a lasting influence in the Hungarian Native Faith movement, as Badinyi-J√≥s was among the first to propose the constitution of an ethnic \\"Hungarian Church\\". Other scholars proposed the kinship of the Hungarians with Hebrews, Persians, ancient Egyptians, and others even with Japanese, Chinese, Greeks, and other peoples. Already in 1770, J√°nos Sajnovics demonstrated the relationship of Hungarian with Uralic languages, with the publication of the Demonstratio idioma Ungarorum et Lapponum idem esse. In the nineteenth century, with new studies on folklore, academic circles welcomed the idea that ancient Hungarian religion was essentially shamanic, related to Uralic and Siberian traditions. In the meantime, Arnold Ipolyi, bishop of Oradea, published his monumental work Magyar Mythol√≥gia (Hungarian Mythology), finished in 1854, aimed at matching the Brothers Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie. In the 1960s, M√°ty√°s Jen≈ë Feh√©r, another emigrant to Argentina who was a church-historian and former Dominican, provided a seminal view for a post-Christian Hungary. From 1967, he published several books about the Kassai K√≥dex or Collectio Dominicana. He claimed that in 1944 he had found in Kosice a previously unknown medieval codex with records from inquisition courts. The codex documented a centuries- long effort by the Christian church to exterminate the taltoses, Hungarian shamans, the representatives of the pre-Christian Hungarian religion whose role was to preserve the integrity of the nation. Though it is considered a forgery by academic scholarship, the document is among the reference points for proponents of the Hungarian Native Faith to illustrate the high morality of the indigenous religion and of its representatives. =Taltosism= \\"Taltosism\\" is Hungarian shamanism, practised by the t√°ltos (English plural \\"taltoses\\"), that is to say Hungarian shamans, and is an essential element of the Hungarian Native Faith. Hungarian chronicles of the 13th century still reported about \\"magicians\\" (taltoses) who practised their rites for the welfare of society. Hungarian taltosism persisted until the World War II in rural areas, where certain people were still considered taltoses by the local communities, though they practiced weather-magic only. Ideas about an ethnic Hungarian shamanism as a defining characteristic of the Hungarian essence were studied within a psychoanalytic framework by G√©za R√≥heim in the 1920s, and later by Vilmos Di√≥szegi with field work in Siberia in the 1950s and the 1960s. The shamanic character of the original Hungarian religion is accepted by most contemporary scholars, and has been the focus of most new studies. Study of the taltoses Di√≥szegi described taltoses as specialists who are able of going through a controlled ecstasy (rejtez√©s). One becomes a taltos by heredity or vocation, and the process of becoming one includes the typical stages of psychophysical disease, acceptance and healing: After an initial resistance to vocation and the various symptoms of the \\"shamanic disease\\", the chosen by the gods finally accepts his role and is endowed with his powers. Taltoses acquire superior knowledge at a young age‚Äîusually at seven‚Äî, through shamanic journeys taking place in days-long dreams, in which the main goal is to climb the √©gig √©r≈ë fa (\\"sky-high tree\\"), also called √©let fa (\\"tree of life\\"), vil√°g fa (\\"world tree\\") or tetejetlen fa (\\"tree without a top\\"). Di√≥szegi considered many elements of Hungarian taltosism to be peculiar to the Hungarian ethnicity, not to be found in Central Asian shamanic traditions. He described the role of the taltos as the \\"recognition and accomplishment of things required by the community, but unresolved due to the limitation of its own [the community's] powers\\". Contemporary Hungarian religious studies, primarily the academic circle revolving around Mih√°ly Hopp√°l, has acquired an important role for the international study of shamanism. The Hungarian ethnological discourse presents taltoses, and shamans in general, as those whose socio-religious role is to heal, prophesize and keep the integrity of cultural traditions by connecting the past and the present and thus projecting into the future, integrating the individual and the community, mankind and the gods. In the words of Hopp√°l, shamanism is depicted as a \\"bridge and symbol, because it interconnects the traditions of the past with the present, and anchors the future of traditions\\". The shaman's tasks are \\"leading the community, guarding the ethnic consciousness, being a (sacrificial) priest\\". Modern taltosism A modern taltos performing a ritual with his drum, in front of a fire. The modern taltos movement started in the 1980s, developing links with Michael Harner and other representatives of core shamanism from the United States since 1986. However, there are significant differences between American neoshamanism and Hungarian modern taltosism. While the American movement aims at representing a trans-cultural technique, designed as adaptable to different cultural contexts, and focused on self-empowerment and healing application, Hungarian taltosism is first and foremost an ethnic religious technique. Mih√°ly Hopp√°l supported the taltos revival in his country as a means for consolidating a Hungarian Native Faith, and therefore for ethnic rejuvenation. Congregations of taltoses and their followers hold weekly ritual and healing gatherings, and they organise pilgrimages to holy sites. Rituals practised by Hungarian Native Faith practitioners include rituals of initiation and passage, and rituals for fertility, healing and purification, either for the environment, the community of believers, or the entire Hungarian nation. They may involve sweat lodges, fire-walk, drumming, and techniques of meditation. While the ceremonies are usually led by taltoses, the community of believers is actively involved. Among well-known modern taltoses there are Zolt√°n Nagy S√≥lyomfi, Istv√°n Somogyi, Feh√©rholl√≥ √ñsk√º, and Andr√°s Kov√°cs-Magyar. Other mediators of the tradition are Imr√© M√°t√©, Attila Heffner, Tam√°s Hervay, and G√°bor Szemz≈ë. Although they belong to different organisations, they agree on the monotheism of Hungarian Native Faith's theology and on the role of the taltos. According to them, the taltos functions as \\"the bridge between the celestial and the earthly worlds, between the irrational and the rational, the endless and the finite\\". Taltoses are interpreters of the transcendent. According to Attila Heffner's definition: Taltoses share their knowledge acting as instructors, teaching their ideas in organised frameworks (for instance S√≥lyomfi's School of the Ancient Source or Kov√°cs' Taltos School), through lectures or in discussion circles. The techniques for getting in touch with the transcendent (r√©v√ºl√©s) take place through an active participation in ceremonies and rituals. Taltoses are religious specialists, and their role of healers is particularly pronounced; for instance, exercises of directed meditation, induced by drumming, to eliminate harmful thoughts, play a prominent role in their practice. In their responsibility for the entire nation, and their role as keepers and awakeners of the national essence, modern taltoses often claim connection with the royal House of √Årp√°d‚Äîthe first dynasty to rule Hungary‚Äîand with Jesus, reinterpreted as a shamanic figure. According to Attila Heffner: =Scriptures= Within the Hungarian Native Faith movement, two mythopoetic texts have become the bases of two concurrent streams of religious doctrine. These texts are the Arvisura written by Zolt√°n Pa√°l, and the Yotengrit four- books collection written by Imre M√°t√©. Mythopoetic themes from both the works have more recently been synthesised in other media, such as the long animated film Sons of Heaven (Az √âg Ô¨Åai, 2010). Another long animation influenced by Hungarian Native Faith narratives, this time based on ethnographic and historical data from the Uralic paradigm and realised with subsidy from the national government, is the Song of the Miraculous Hind (√ânek a csodaszarvasr√≥l, 2002). Zolt√°n Pa√°l (1913‚Äì1982) was a steelworker who, during the Second World War, was initiated by a Siberian Mansi shaman named Tura Salavare, whom was then soldier in the Red Army. Pa√°l compiled the knowledge he acquired in the Arvisura, which tells the history of the Hunnish tribes starting from a mythical prehistory, to their settling of Mesopotamia and then Ordos, and finally to Matthias Corvinus. The book draws elements from Finno- Ugric traditions. The Yotengrit is more religious-philosophical in its message. Its author Imre M√°t√© was the taltos, or b√°csa, founder of the Yotengrit Church. The work claims to represent the faithful transmission of the ancient knowledge preserved by people in the R√°bak√∂z region of western Hungary, the heritage of the so-called \\"B√º√ºn-religion\\", the persecuted original faith of the Hungarians. The work and especially the Prophecy of Nyirka which it contains, an allegorical text supposed to forebode the future of Hungary and global politics, has become a stronghold for nationalism and far-right occultism. Hungarian Native Faith churches There are a variety of Hungarian Native Faith churches reflecting the movement's internal diversity. These churches differ from each other in both their doctrines and the character of their activities. They often develop from local taltos-led communities, or are individually established by a taltos. These taltoses are considered by their followers valid spiritual leaders and while some practise only within the boundaries of their local communities, others have acquired a national reputation. Their popular acknowledgement depends on attributed ritual and healing efficacy. There are churches which base their doctrines on an outspoken synthesis of different traditions, and churches which claim to represent purely native traditions. In the first group there are the Church of Esoteric Doctrines (Ezoterikus Tanok Egyh√°za) or Church of the Holy Crown (Szent Korona Egyh√°z)‚Äîfounded in 1996 and officially registered by the Hungarian state in 1997‚Äî, the Church of the Universe (Univerzum Egyh√°za) of Gi√∂rgy P√©ter P√°l Kisfaludy, and the Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church of Andr√°s Kov√°cs. Most of the others fall within the second category, including the Community of Hungarian Religion of Attila Kov√°cs, the Ancient Hungarian Church of L√°szl√≥ Hjad√∫ Nimr√≥d, the Yotengrit Church of Imre M√°t√©, the Firebird Taltos Drum Circle of Zolt√°n S√≥lyomfi, the People of √Årp√°d Drumming Circle of Lehel Bakonyi, and the Traditional Church of the Order of √Årp√°d. The most influential among them have been the Yotengrit Church and the Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church. Besides these taltos-led groups there are taltoses who do not have a community and yet are regarded as the most charismatic figures of Hungarian Native Faith. They include Attila Heffner, Tam√°s Hervay the \\"Soul-Lifting Taltos\\", and J√°nos Majercsik Oguz. =Andr√°s Kov√°cs' Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church= Gateway of the Noetic Taltos School. The Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church (≈êsmagyar T√°ltos Egyh√°z) founded by Andr√°s Kov√°cs, a disciple of Kisfaludy, teaches a Hungarian Native Faith doctrine which it claims to be the original religion of the Huns. According to the church, God the Father is an energetic vibration which incarnated in a host, the Mother of God, begetting the Sun God (of whom Jesus is a representation). The Pilis Mountains are a holy place according to the Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church. Kov√°cs is also the founder and director of the Noetic Taltos School (Szellemi T√°ltos Iskola). =Attila Kov√°cs' Community of the Hungarian Religion= The Community of the Hungarian Religion (Magyar Vall√°s K√∂z√∂ss√©ge) inherits those scholarly studies of the nineteenth century which claimed that Hungarian and Sumerian language share an origin in the hypothetical Turanian linguistic family. Based on these ideas, in the 1930s Zolt√°n Bencsi founded the Turanian Monotheist Movement. After Mikl√≥s Horthy's government banned the organisation, some members went abroad. Among them was √ìtto J√°nos Homonnay, who in the 1960s, in Canada, established the Hungarian Turul Society to promote the Turanist theses. In 1979, after Homonnay's death, J√°nos P√°ll took over the leadership of the group. eventually this group divided and another group was formed under the direction of Albin Istv√°n Zalezs√°k, who authored the work, ISA-TEN TAN (Magyar Isme), published in Toronto in 1986. The Community of Hungarian Religion was founded in Hungary in 1992 as a continuation of the Turul Society. The current leader is Attila Kov√°cs, according to whom the church already had gathered around one thousand members in the late 1990s. The church is not distinctively anti-Christian, but considered the adoption of Christianity by King Stephen I in 1000 CE a disaster which brought about the destruction of authentic Hungarian religious culture. The church endorses the hypothesis of the kinship of Hungarians and Sumerians, and supports the use of the Old Hungarian alphabet instead of the Latin script. =Imre M√°t√©'s Yotengrit Church= The Yotengrit Church (Yotengrit Egyh√°z), whose complete name is the Church of the Ancient Spirit of the Endless Sea (Tengerv√©gtelen ≈ês-Szellem Egyh√°za), was founded around 2007 by Imre M√°t√©. He, whose title in the organisation was b√°csa (\\"master\\"), emigrated to Germany in 1956, during the revolution against the communist government of the Hungarian People's Republic in which he participated. While in Germany, he worked as a businessman and poet, but returned to Hungary in the 2000s to spend his last years in B√°gyogszov√°t. He founded the Yotengrit Church as the representative of the ancient Hungarian religion, the so-called \\"B√º√ºn-religion\\", passed down through the unwritten tradition of the tud√≥ (\\"knower\\") people along the Raba river. M√°t√© published a series of nine books, entitled Yotengrit, in which he explained theology and linguistic etymology. In recent years, the Yotengrit Church has become one of the most influential organisations of the Hungarian Native Faith. While it is considered by its adherents as a faithful heir of the pre-Christian Hungarian belief systems, it shows various non-indigenous influences. The theology of the Yotengrit Church emphasises a conception of primordial God, called Yotengrit, Tengrit or Tengri, which represents all the deities in their yet undivided state. In Hungarian the related word tenger means \\"sea\\", and represents such primordial undifferentiation. The primordial God then manifests as a male‚Äìfemale duality: Ukk√≥, the mother goddess whose forehead is decorated by the moon, and who is identified as the Boldogasszony (the \\"Blessed Lady\\") of Christianised folk beliefs; and G√∂n√ºz, the sun-faced father god. At the time of the foundation of the church, Imre M√°t√© proclaimed the importance of an all-encompassing conception of God: At the same time, the theology emphasises a national god peculiar to the Hungarians, M√°-Tun, the deified hero of the folk tale entitled Feh√©rl√≥fia (\\"Son of the White Horse\\"), who was originally a totemic animal ancestor. M√°-Tun is identified with the historical figure of Maodu, founder of the first Xiongnu empire, and according to M√°t√© also of the empire of the Huns. The Yotengrit Church is politically neutral, but, as M√°t√©'s stated, its teachings may be a \\"source of sane, aggression-free national politics\\". =L√°szl√≥ Nimr√≥d's Ancient Hungarian Church= The Ancient Hungarian Church (≈êsmagyar Egyh√°z), whose Hungarian headquarters are located in Mogyor√≥d, was first established in Budapest in the 1990 by L√°szl√≥ Hjad√∫ Nimr√≥d, and was officially registered in 1998. Nimr√≥d spends most of the year in the United States and the church has international headquarters located in Los Angeles. The doctrine of the Ancient Hungarian Church is a synthesis of ancient Hungarian, East Asian and Christian beliefs, though all of them are claimed to be original Hungarian-Turanian beliefs. The church has strict religious regulations. For instance, preachers have to wear white and purple clothes with folk patterns. They celebrate the major holidays of the Christian calendar, winter and summer solstice, national holidays and the birthdays of important Hungarian historical personages. =Zolt√°n S√≥lyomfi's Firebird Taltos Drum Circle= The Firebird Taltos Drum Circle (T≈±zmad√°r T√°ltos Dobk√∂r) was founded in 2006 by Zolt√°n Nagy S√≥lyomfi, who also acted as the chief executive of the Yotengrit Church when it was registered by the government. He later left the Yotengrit Church for undisclosed internal disputes and, despite his wish to return, was not allowed to do so by M√°t√©. The aim of the group is to revive ancient Hungarian spirituality, mediating it to society in modern forms, helping the individuals to understand themselves and thus healing the world tree, which manifests itself through the individuals. The theology of the Drum Circle is \\"based upon the ancient Hungarian conception of the world, which is the One (God) which incorporates everything that exists\\". S√≥lyomfi teaches that there are two worlds: One is the \\"manifest world\\" represented by the world tree, while the other one is the \\"unmanifested, unshaped space\\" which contains the \\"shared consciousness\\" of mankind. The Drum Circle emphasises practice over doctrine, including drumming, breathing and voice techniques. The aim of these practices is to widen one's consciousness to understand the operations of the One, becoming like the One. The group practises ritual ceremonies for birth, initiation, marriage, death and the feasts of the Yearly Round. The School of the Ancient Source (≈êsforr√°s Iskola), associated with the church, organises camps and pilgrimages. =Traditional Church of the Order of √Årp√°d= The Traditional Church of the Order of √Årp√°d (√Årp√°d Rendj√©nek Jogalapja Tradicion√°lis Egyh√°z) was founded in 2009 and has its reference points in the Turanist emigree ideologists Adorj√°n Magyar and Victor Pad√°nyi, but it is also inspired by the Traditionalist School, the Nouvelle Droite of Alain de Benoist, and to the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion. =Gaffer Bolya's Nest= The group named Bolyanest (Gaffer Bolya's Nest) was founded in 1979 by Gaffer Bolya, a teacher in vocational secondary school titled Bolyap√≥ within the group itself. Bolya's starting aim was to provide a way of good life for his students, whom formed the original core members of the group. The centre of the movement is in Budapest, and it was registered by the government in 1999. It is considered amongst the most influential Hungarian Native Faith movements today, especially concerning the process of re-mythologisation of Hungarian history. The group was originally focused on nature religion, while in the most recent decades its focus has shifted to the discourse about ethnic roots. Bolya acts as the group's ceremonial leader. The group has a core membership of around one hundred people, but its influence reaches the thousands of people. They are mostly from Budapest's middle class, but there are also farmers, entrepreneurs and intellectuals. The average age is over fifty-five and most of them are highly educated. They outspokenly identify themselves as non-Christians, though they do not presume to be the continuators of a well- defined pre-Christian religion; rather, they consciously construct a new religion based on Hungarian folklore and elements from other cultures' indigenous religions. Sumerian culture has been one of the main sources, although other cultures are explored too; for instance, Sumerian prayers are sung together with Russian songs. They regard some natural sites surrounding Budapest and farther localities such as S√≥sk√∫t, Borsodgeszt, and Bodrogk√∂z, as their holy places where to make pilgrimage. A fundamental teaching of Bolya is the conceptual distinction between \\"order\\" and \\"system\\", which remains the core of Bolyanest's thought. The former, the order, defines the natural way of being of everything in nature; everything is interconnected and interdependent, and each single part has a role in its instinctual cooperation with the others. The latter, the system, defines unnatural and artificial superstructures which take shape in societies when individuals and groups are surrounded by growing webs of norms, and are gradually alienated from each other and from their natural contexts. Gaffer Bolya was likely inspired by his studies of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's and Leo Tolstoy's thought in the development of this vision. Identity and politics Gathering of a Hungarian Native Faith group for the performance of a ritual. The two leading figures hold ritual spears with strips of cloth of the colours of the flag of Hungary tied near the tips. =Nationalism and anti-multiculturalism= Hungarian Native Faith groups generally put a great emphasis on the discourse about ethnic roots, which are re-mythologised. Many Hungarian Native Faith groups espouse nationalistic political views and organise their communities in exclusive ways, exhibiting political intolerance. At the same time, pluralism and multiculturalism are viewed as disturbances which erode Hungarian identity. The popularity of these stances is attributed by scholars to the abrupt fall of the Iron Curtain, followed by spiritual vacuum and the perception of being invaded by a \\"multi-faceted cultural market\\", which created an identity crisis in post-Soviet countries. In the case of Hungarian Native Faith groups, this resulted in a rejection of postmodern heterogeneity and a sacralisation of the national identity, in which language, religion and politics form a single entity. Hungarian Native Faith groups see themselves as a core minority, amongst all Hungarians, which represents the quintessence of Hungarianness. =Relationship with Christianity= The relationship between Hungarian Native Faith and Christianity varies from church to church. Some Hungarian Native Faith groups use Christian themes and terminology in their own doctrines, or propose the incorporation of Christianity itself into the Hungarian Native Faith, such as in the case of groups developing in the wake of the teachings of Ferenc Badinyi-J√≥s. Others, like the Community of Hungarian Religion and the Bolyanest, are instead outspokenly anti-Christian. A fundamental notion in Hungarian Native Faith is that each \\"nation\\" should have its own \\"faith\\", and a \\"Christian Hungary\\" represents an anomaly which needs to be rectified. This rectification should come from a liquidation of Christianity. Even among those Hungarian Native Faith groups which nourish warm feelings towards Jesus, regarded as compatible with the indigenous religion, including the Yotengrit Church, the Christian religious institution as it developed after Jesus‚Äîthe so-called \\"Pauline Christianity\\"‚Äîis in any case perceived as a corrupt entity to be dismantled. More in particular, among these groups it is Eastern Christianity to be valued as compatible with the indigenous religion, and to be considered closer to what Jesus intended, while Western Christianity (the forms which have historically been dominant in Hungary) is seen as its antithesis and as a deviant, evil teaching. In these groups, Jesus is reinterpreted as a powerful ancestor and shaman. Within the Bolyanest, most of the members deem Christianity a superstition aimed at the control of people. Christian symbolic motifs such as the cross and the tree of life are considered, together with the sun and the moon, as symbols of natural pre-Christian religion which were appropriated by the Christian churches. The majority of believers regards Christianity as the force which eradicated this natural ancient knowledge, including original Hungarian religion, and as the force responsible for the disenchantment of the world. =Relationship with Central Asian Tengrism= Those taltoses who espouse Turanist theories sometimes declare explicit affiliation with Tengrism, the Turkic ethnic religion. This is the case of Zolt√°n S√≥lyomfi. These taltoses are generally characterised by their use of the Turkic name of God, Tengri, instead of the Hungarian term Isten. In 2012 a nine-meters high √©let fa (tree of life) was donated by Hungarian Native Faith groups to the Tengrists of Kazakhstan. In the same year, Ojun Adigzsi See-Oglu, a shaman from Tuva, was invited to the Hungarian Parliament Building to perform a ritual dance around the Holy Crown of Hungary for the welfare of the Hungarian nation.
