It was an attempt by a huge Portuguese army under the command of Joanne Mendes de Vasconcelos, governor of Alentejo, to capture the Spanish city of Badajoz, which was the headquarters of the Spanish Army of Extremadura. The fortifications of Badajoz were essentially medieval and considered vulnerable by the Portuguese, and had already been attacked by them three times during this war.White, p. 68 So in 1658, Mendes de Vasconcelos gathered an army at Elvas and advanced on Badajoz. The city was poorly defended and the Spanish troops under the command of Francisco de Tuttavilla, Duke of San Germ√°n, looked principally to their own survival until a Spanish relief expedition could be mounted. The Portuguese forces launched a direct assault on the town, hoping initially to capture a key fort, San Crist√≥bal, but after 22 days of unsuccessful attack, the Portuguese abandoned this plan and began to build a circumvallation wall around Badajoz instead, to try to isolate the city. These plans received a boost when they captured a large Spanish defensive installation outside Badajoz, the Fort of San Miguel, but were unable to use this platform successfully against Badajoz itself. The siege lasted for four months, during which time one-third of the Portuguese troops either died (mainly from the plague) or deserted. The arrival of a relief army, under King Philip IV of Spain's favorite don Luis de Haro in October, lifted the siege. Mendes de Vasconcelos, the Portuguese commander, was stripped of his rank and imprisoned for his failure. Taking advantage of this failure, D. Luis de Haro, invaded Portugal and besieged Elvas, the main defensive system of Portugal - where the Portuguese army that had besieged Badajoz took refuge and was suffering a second catastrophic plague. A small relief army was improvised by the Portuguese which inflicted a crushing defeat to the Spanish army at the decisive battle of the Lines of Elvas (14 January 1659).Facing the imminent arrival of an army led by D. Luis de Haro, the Portuguese troops opted by withdrawing to Elvas and waiting for the Spanish.The confrontation occurred in January 1659, and was a thunderous disaster to D. Luis‚Ä¶the military setback, which added to the disastrous situation of the Netherlands, forced Madrid to seek peace with France. in Valladares, Rafael- La Rebeli√≥n de Portugal 1640-1680, Junta de Castilla Y Le√≥n, Consejer√≠a de Educaci√≥n y Cultura, 1998, page 163 This way, the Portuguese independence was granted while the Spanish reached military advantage in the secondary front of war, Minho and Galicia. Background After the death of John IV of Portugal in 1656, various Spanish offensives were launched against Portuguese territory, mainly from Extremadura, but also from Galicia, where a second front was opened to force the Portuguese to divide their forces.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, p. 158 The Spanish Army of Extremadura, recently reinforced with many veterans of the war against France, was commanded by Francisco de Tuttavilla, Duke of San German, who appointed Gaspar T√©llez-Gir√≥n y Sandoval, Duke of Osuna, as general of artillery and his second-in-command.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, p. 159 In 1657 they laid siege to the Portuguese town of Oliven√ßa with 8,000 soldiers and 29 cannons and occupied the town, despite a desperate attempt by the Count of San Lorenzo, military governor of Alentejo, to dislodge them by launching a surprise attack himself on the Spanish town of Badajoz. Mour√£o fell into Spanish hands shortly thereafter. San Lorenzo was then dismissed from his command and replaced by dom Joanne Mendes de Vasconcelos, who easily managed to retake both Mour√£o and Oliven√ßa in the following months, since their Spanish garrisons had been considerably diminished in order to move troops to face the French armies in Catalonia.Aldama/Gonz√°lez, p. 368‚Äì369 Map of Extremadura by Thomas Lopez. Mendes de Vasconcelos, encouraged by his successes, promised the Portuguese Queen Regent Luisa de Guzm√°n that he would capture the town of Badajoz, headquarters of the Spanish Army of Extremadura and therefore the most important Spanish fortress near the Portuguese frontier.Aldama/Gonz√°lez, p. 369 The Count of Sabugal suggested that an offensive in the north, to conquer the Galician city of Tui, would be easier, due to the mild climate of the coast, and suggested that this would also be strategically more beneficial as it would secure the province of Entre Douro e Minho. But the queen and her ministers preferred Mendes de Vasconcelos' plan.Ericeira, p. 93 He was given command of an army consisting of 14,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry troops with a train of 20 cannons and 2 mortars, gathered in the main fortress of Elvas. Mendes de Vasconcelos' second-in-command was the recently appointed Maestro de Campo General dom Rodrigo de Castro, a friend of the Count of Soure, Vasconcelos' enemy in the court, which was a cause of friction between them.Ericeira, p. 94 Engraving of Gaspar T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 5th Duke de Osuna by Giovanni Battista Bonacina. The Spanish fortress town of Badajoz was at that time garrisoned by 4,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry soldiers. The military governor of the fortress was the Marquis of Lanzarote, Diego Paniagua y Z√∫√±iga, but the command of the army belonged to the Duke of San German, who had retreated to Badajoz after the loss of Olivenza, which he had briefly attempted to retake. The infantry was led by don Diego Caballero de Illescas, the tercios by don Rodrigo de M√∫gica y Butr√≥n, the cavalry by the Duke of Osuna, and the artillery by don Gaspar de la Cueva, brother of the Viceroy of New Spain. The defenses of the town consisted essentially of an old Moorish Alcazaba and a medieval wall dating from the Almohad period, reinforced since the outbreak of the war in 1640 by various newly built bulwarks and ravelins.Villalon, p. 120 Siege=Preliminary maneuvers The Portuguese army left its fortress at Elvas on 12 July and arrived outside Badajoz the following day. A company of cuirassiers under dom Luiz de Menezes and some cavalry troops commanded by dom Andr√© de Albuquerque were confronted near a bridge over the Guadiana river by a Spanish cavalry party led by the Duke of Osuna.Ericeira, p. 100 Both units retreated after inflicting serious losses upon each other in a bloody fight, the Spanish seeking protection behind the walls of the town. Mendes de Vasconcelos arrived shortly thereafter with the main Portuguese army, with its artillery, and a large number of supply wagons brought from Elvas. Seeing the strength of the Portuguese army, the Duke of San German hastily sent a message calling on Philip IV for help. View of Fort San Crist√≥bal in an engraving by G. Baillieu from the Atlas fran√ßois: contenant les cartes geographiques dans lesquelles sont tres exactement remarquez. Despite the longstanding danger of a Portuguese attack, the situation of the Spanish force in Badajoz was dreadful. The garrison suffered from a lack of ammunition and supplies, the soldiers were dressed in rags or were practically nude, and there was none among the civilian population of the town trained to wield a weapon. The Duke of San German put soldiers and civilians to work on the fortifications and storing food. The Portuguese sappers, meanwhile, proceeded to prepare the field for an assault upon the fortress. Mendes de Vasconcelos had decided, in a war council with many other senior officers, to attack Fort San Crist√≥bal, a key point in the Badajoz defenses.Ericeira, p. 102 This fort, built after 1640, covered a bridgehead over the Guadiana river, thus guarding access to the city.Villalon, p. 121 A redoubt was quickly strengthened on the bridgehead by the Spanish sappers, who, protected by the Duke of Osuna and his cavalry, also widened the trenches which connected it with Fort San Crist√≥bal, the garrison of which was being strengthened every day along a strongly defended communication road. The Portuguese assault was thoroughly prepared. The plan was for six Portuguese squadrons under dom Jo√£o da Silva to block the entrance to the bridge, isolating the redoubt from Fort San Cris√≥bal. The fort would in turn be attacked by Alfonso Futrado and Simon Correa da Silva. Maestre de Campo dom Diogo Gomes was given the task of cutting the communication lines along the Guadiana river and Pedro Almado of distracting several minor forts nearby. Some cavalry regiments were deployed in the expectation of a fierce Spanish resistance. The assault, however, was a costly failure. After twenty-two days of prolonged action, during which the defenders, led by the Marquis of Lanzarote, virtually wiped out Almado's regiment with musketry fire and firebombs, Mendes de Vasconcelos ordered a withdrawal.Ericeira, p. 107 Attempted encirclement lines of circumvallation according to a Spanish contemporaneous map. The Portuguese general, convinced of the impossibility of taking Badajoz by assault, changed his strategy and began a circumvallation of the town, in order to try to isolate it completely. The Spanish, meanwhile, were reinforcing their own defensive fortifications with extensive works, mainly ravelins built between the medieval towers. Various outlying forts were also strengthened with the aim of obstructing the Portuguese works and forcing them to build a larger circumvallation line.Villalon, p. 122 One of these forts was San Miguel, a star fort able to accommodate 600 infantry, built around a hermitage. It had five earthen bulwarks and an artillery-proof parapet. Portuguese sappers built a pontoon bridge over the Guadiana river which united two Portuguese quarters in Vado del Moro and allowed Mendes de Vasconcelos' troops to cross the river.Ericeira, p. 111 Having reinforced Santa Engracia, north of San Crits√≥bal, and fortified a bridge over the G√©vora river, they built, unmolested, an arc of the circumvallation from G√©vora to Vado del Moro. Fort del Mayordomo, located near the Guadiana river, had been abandoned by its Spanish garrison shortly after being built. The Portuguese used it to cover the construction of the circumvallation line to the Guadiana. They also tried to occupy Cerro del Viento, a hill near Vado del Moro, but were repelled by the Spanish garrison that was there and had to build the circumvallation line behind it. Given the strategic importance of Cerro del Viento, the nearby hill of Cerro de las Mayas had been earmarked for an improvised star fortification by the Italian general Ventura de Tarragona, but it had not been built, leaving the Fort of San Miguel vulnerable. Marquis de Legan√©s. Mendes de Vasconcelos instructed dom Andr√© de Albuquerque, dom Rodrigo de Castro and the Count of Misquitella to occupy the Convent of San Gabriel. All the Portuguese cavalry and five ter√ßos were dispatched with this aim. They passed through the undefended Cerro de las Mayas and easily overran the convent, whose small Spanish garrison promptly surrendered. The Portuguese sappers then began to build a fort in front of an old watchtower known as \\"Torre quebrada\\", located between the convent and the Fort of San Miguel.Villalon, p. 123 The continued Spanish occupation of the Fort of San Miguel was preventing the completion of the circumvallation line, so its capture was a priority to Vasconcellos. Albuquerque and the Count of Misquitellos, assisted by the engineers Nicolao de Lanres, Pedro de S. Coloma, and Luiz Serr√£o Pimentel, planned an assault on the fortification.Ericeira, p. 113 On 20 June, after an ineffective bombardment by a 6-gun battery put in place to try to breach the parapets, the Portuguese tercios and the cavalry, the latter covered by ranks of musketeers, were ordered to attack.Ericeira, p. 114 The advance was made difficult by the presence of vineyard fences in the field. Moreover, 5 Portuguese battalions at the head of the attack were surprised by the Spanish cavalry of the Duke of Osuna and his general, don Juan de Pacheco, followed by the Duke of San German who, with various Spanish tercios, had sallied out of Badajoz in order to try to counter the Portuguese assault.Ericeira, p. 115‚Äì116 Maestre de Campo of Tercio de la Armada, whose brother the Irish officer William Dongan was the commander of the Fort of San Miguel, managed to reach the fort.Ericeira, p. 116 Albuquerque, meanwhile ordered dom Luiz de Menezes to reinforce his vanguard battalions. The Portuguese cavalry was also sent into action. Teniente General Diniz de Mello de Castro was wounded and captured, but a Spanish counter-attack was repelled and the Fort of San Miguel finally surrendered.Ericeira, p. 117‚Äì118 Skirmishing and bombardment Francisco Tuttavilla, Duke of San Germ√°n. Unknown author. The capture of Fort San Miguel allowed the Portuguese sappers to complete the circumvallation works, which consisted of a continuous line of little forts, each able to garrison as many as about 200 soldiers, or perhaps as few as 25 musketeers. The Spanish also continued strengthening their defenses. The Southwestern section of the wall was fortified at Pedraleras, and a ravelin was erected 400 meters in front of the Gate of Santa Maria. No significant action took place during this period, except for an ambush near San Gabriel by Andr√© de Albuquerque, against a Spanish supply convoy sent from La Albuera,Ericeira, p. 122‚Äì123 and various sorties by the garrison of Badajoz to try to obstruct the Portuguese works.Ericeira, p. 124 A night attack by the Spanish Duke of Osuna against a Portuguese section cost Mendes de Vasconcelos 200 infantry and 40 horses.Ribeiro, p. 180 On 6 August, however, Osuna and San German abandoned the town, and with 1,200 cavalry soldiers, broke the lines of circumvallation near the quarter of Santa Engracia, between two Portuguese redoubts, reaching Alburquerque shortly thereafter.Ribeiro, p. 181 San German was replaced in the command of Badajoz by Rodrigo de M√∫gica y Butr√≥n, his Maestre de Campo General.Ribeiro, p. 179 The Spanish concentrated their efforts on the defense of a large ravelin in Pradaleras garrisoned by 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, against Portuguese artillery fire from Cerro del Viento and San Miguel. In late August, news of the formation of a relief army under Philip IV of Spain's favorite Luis de Haro reached the Portuguese camp, increasing the pressure upon Mendes de Vasconcelos to bring his siege to a conclusion.Ericeira, p. 127 Unfortunately, the damage caused by the bombardment of the Spanish positions was minor, and heat and disease was decimating the Portuguese army.Villalon, p. 124 Relief The Duke of Medina de las Torres had suggested that Philip IV himself should lead the relief of Badajoz in the company of all the Grandees of Spain.Aldama/Gonz√°lez, p. 370 Luis de Haro, Philip IV's favourite, however, feared that Queen Mariana of Austria would be given the government of the country during the absence of the king, and, although having no military experience, offered himself to lead the relief army. His force consisted of up to 12,000 infantry and 4,500 cavalry, or perhaps as little as 8,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. Haro did not reach Badajoz until mid-October, but his appearance compelled Mendes de Vasconcelos to abandon the siege. The buildings in Cerro del Viento were set on fire and the bridge over the G√©vora river was destroyed, The Portuguese army retreated unmolested to Elvas having lost 6,200 men in all, either killed in battle or dead from disease. Aftermath Don Luis de Haro, anonymous painting from the Uffizi Gallery. When the Spanish relief army arrived, Luis de Haro entered Badajoz, where he was acclaimed by some as \\"Liberator of the town and Restorator of the Monarchy\\".Gebhardt, p. 506 In Portugal, Queen Luisa de Guzm√°n imprisoned Mendes de Vasconcelos for his failure to capture Badajoz.Gebhardt, p. 506‚Äì507 News of a further setback for the Portuguese arrived from the northern frontier, as a Spanish army commanded by the Governor of Galicia, Rodrigo Pimentel, Marquis of Viana, entered Portuguese territory in early September, defeating a Portuguese army led by Jo√£o Rodrigues de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 2nd Count of Castelo Melhor at the Battle of Vilanova. Spanish forces proceeded over the following months to capture Lapela, Mon√ß√£o, Salvatierra de Mi√±o and other Portuguese strongholds.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, p. 173 De Haro, meanwhile, decided to attack Portugal on his own and, against the advice of the Duke of San German, advanced towards the Portuguese fortress of Elvas. Elvas was reached by the Spanish army on 22 October and a siege begun.Halliday, p. 79 Although the fortifications could not ensure safety from a full-scale assault supported with heavy guns, they enabled the defenders to withstand a considerable attack for enough time to allow the Portuguese to mobilize a relief army in Estremoz, firstly under Andr√© de Albuquerque and later under Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, Count of Cantanhede. On 17 January, around 8 o'clock in the morning, the Portuguese attacked the Spanish in their trenches.Halliday, p. 80 The battle was undecided in its initial stages, as the Duke of San Germ√°n and other Spanish generals made every effort to collect their troops and recover the lost ground, but after some time, the Portuguese forces of Cantanhede managed to break the lines and the Spanish retreated to Badajoz with great loss:Halliday, p.81 from the initial army of 17, 500 men, only 5,000 infantry men plus 1,300 horsemen managed to reach Badajoz, and all the artillery together with 5,000 men, 15,000 firearms, luggage and correspondence, were captured.Count of Ericeira (who was General of artillery in this battle of Elvas), page 227 in the 1751 edition or Page 222 in the 1946 edition The Portuguese army again besieged Badajoz shortly after, bringing events in the region full circle, but failed once again to take the city. By then, the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees had ended Spains's war with France and the recovery of Portugal had become the main objective of Philip IV.S√°nchez Marcos, p. 161 NotesReferences    * * Category:Sieges of the Portuguese Restoration War Badajoz Category:1658 in Portugal Category:1658 in Spain Siege of Badajoz (1658) Category:Battles in Extremadura Badajoz Badajoz ","title":"Siege of Badajoz (1658)"},{"id":"29228053","text":"Micha≈Ç Ciarkowski (born 5 July 1989 in Pozna≈Ñ) is a Polish footballer who currently plays for GKS Be≈Çchat√≥w.

She is adopted by foster parents and thirty years later marries Adam, a consultant neonatologist dealing with premature babies. She gives birth to Ruby and starts a new life for herself and her small family. But a tragedy suddenly upsets the calm order of her life and changes its course forever. The novel traces the harrowing life of Rebecca with several interesting temporal juxtapositions and flashbacks that add to its complexity.  Plot summary  Prologue The story opens with Rebecca and Ruby walking along the coast road from St Just to Zennor in Cornwall. This is during the time of a visit to Cornwall with Adam to visit his relative‚Äôs grave. Part One ‚Äì Shoebox Story Rebecca recounts the discovery of herself as a foundling by Lucia, after she is abandoned by her young mother outside an Italian restaurant. This is at a time when she is working for Mr Damiano, a mysterious ex-circus owner who has set up a chain of boutique hotels that Rebecca helps to manage. On a flight back to England, one of the plane‚Äôs engines fails and it is forced to return to New York. It is whilst standing on the tarmac that Rebecca decides to hand in her notice, having lost all zest for her work. Rebecca‚Äôs story goes back to the time when she was sharing a flat with Joe, an intellectual who is writing a book about Nadezhda Alliluyeva, the thirty-one-year-old wife of Stalin who committed suicide in 1932. He befriends Adam through a shared interest in chess and he and Rebecca fall in love and then marry. Joe decides to move to Moscow to further his research and lives with Olya, and Rebecca and Adam decide to visit him with Ruby. He tells them about Joseph Stalin‚Äôs character and the wave of fear that gripped Russia during his dictatorship. On their return to England, they decide to visit Adam‚Äôs grandmother‚Äôs grave at Barnoon Cemetery in Cornwall and Rebecca is happy that Ruby will have ancestors that she herself can never have. It is on their return to London on a warm August evening that tragedy strikes when Ruby is run down by a motorist. Rebecca cannot reconcile herself to her daughter‚Äôs loss and the intensity of her grief leads to their eventual separation. It is at this time that Rebecca‚Äôs shattered life is restored through her work for Mr Damiano, who tells her his life story as the son of poor trapeze artists. Joe, meanwhile, is working on his second novel ‚Äì about the time of Stalin‚Äôs retreat to his dacha when Hitler invaded Russia. After talking to an Afghan war veteran, he decides to abandon the task and goes to Vancouver Island to write a novel. Rebecca leaves London and, on a visit to St Ives, starts working as a waitress in a local caf√©. Here, she is visited by Joe who gives her a copy of his story. Part Two ‚Äì Boomdiara This part is a narrative of Joe‚Äôs novel which describes the life of Florence, who works in Madame Blanche‚Äôs brothel to support her young daughter, Claire. It is here that she meets Will, a World War One air force pilot, with whom she falls in love. Joe writes to Rebecca that Florence‚Äôs character is based in part on her own. Part Three ‚Äì Flight In this part the stories of Rebecca and Adam and Florence and Will become intertwined. Adam visits Rebecca in her boarding house and they become reunited and return to Ruby who is buried in the same grave as her great grandmother. Will‚Äôs plane is shot up in a fire fight with a German Albatros and he has to cut his engine to prevent his plane going down as a flamer.  Historical and personal references  In the novel, Joe is fascinated by the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam and his relationship with Stalin. He is one of Dunmore's favorite poets and is cited as defining poetry as \\"an aeroplane in full flight giving birth to another aeroplane\\". On 2 August 1938, Mandelstam was sentenced to five years in correction camps. The official cause of his death in a camp is an unspecified illness. As the author herself says about Russia: \\"I didn't choose Russia but Russia chose me. I had been fascinated from an early age by the culture, the language, the literature and the history to the place.\\" And about her novel: \\"Mourning Ruby is not a flat landscape: it is more like a box with pictures painted on every face. And each face is also a door which opens, I hope, to take the reader deep into the book.\\" References External sources  * The Independent, Living dolls and lost children, 17 October 2003. * Bookreporter.com, review of Mourning Ruby Category:2003 British novels Category:Novels by Helen Dunmore ","title":"Mourning Ruby"},{"id":"29228074","text":"Afon Alun in St Davids The River Alun is a small river in northwest Pembrokeshire, Wales, which rises near Tretio Common and flows southwestwards to St Davids to empty into St Bride's Bay at the rocky inlet of Porth Clais.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 Explorer map sheet OL35 North Pembrokeshire  References  Alun ","title":"River Alun, Pembrokeshire"},{"id":"29228077","text":"Primary School no. 2 in Pruszcz Gda≈Ñski (Polish: Szko≈Ça Podstawowa nr 2 w Pruszczu Gda≈Ñskim) ‚Äì public school situated in Pruszcz Gda≈Ñski in Pomeranian Voivodeship.

The tale of Maelor and his three sons, Cornippyn, Crygyn and Bwba, is recorded in the late sixteenth century Welsh text \\"Olion Cewri Cymru...\\" (\\"The Giants of Wales and their dwellings\\") by Sion Dafydd Rhys (with the antiquarian spelling Maylor Gawr).The Giants of Wales and their dwellingsSion Dafydd Rhys, \\"Olion Cewri\\" in T.H.

It came to pass that Maelor was captured in the cwmwd of Cyfeiliog, about twelve miles from his own castle and was sentenced to death. His enemies allowed him his final request to blow on his horn three times before his death. The first time he blew, his hair and beard fell out, and on the second blast of his horn, so great was the strength and force of the sounding that all his finger and toe-nails fell off completely. On the third blast of his horn the intensity of the force of the sound caused the horn to be broken into small pieces. Cornippyn, who was hunting with his horse and his hound, heard the sound of his father's horn and lamented over his suffering. He made to rescue his father and in riding with such haste and swiftness, he tore the head of his hound off its body. He spurred his horse onwards, leaped in one great bound over the Ystwyth river and attacked his father's captors. In the ensuing battle, Cornippin was slain. The other sons, Crygyn and Bwba, lived in Llanilar and Llanbadarn Fawr respectively, and murdered any man who approached their stronghold. They were both killed themselves through cunning, by an unnamed warrior in the same night. Myth, folklore and legend Contemporary stories still relate to one of the more unusual residents of Penparcau village, the headless dog of King Maelor's son Cornippyn. The myth tells of how a giant, going to his father's rescue, rode at such a rate that his dog could not keep up with him and its head came off in the leash. The dog now roams, mournfully crying and looking for its long-lost owner.Jones, T. Gwynn (1930) Welsh Folklore and Folk-Custom London: Methuen & Co Ltd.

In contrast with many other electronic bagpipes which are based solely on a bagpipe chanter, redpipes feature a pressure-sensitive bag in emulation of a bagpipe's bag. Overview Redpipes consists of a chanter which, instead of finger-holes, is equipped with sensors that identify the position of the fingers. These sensors transfer signals to microprocessors inside the bag of the instrument. The software implemented in the redpipe stores the different sounds of a variety of bagpipes, including the Great Highland Bagpipe, Scottish smallpipes, gaita, cornamuse, mediaeval bagpipes and h√ºmmelchen. The programming allows different fingerings and tunings. The bag of the redpipe is stuffed with filling material and a pneumatically driven automatic valve that controls the pressure of the bag. By applying pressure with the arm the player can start and control the chanter and drones, as well as the overblowing function. The pressure that has to be applied to the bag can be adjusted, which allows players handicapped by age or physical restraints to play the instrument easily. The bag must be filled with air before starting to play, either by the breath of the player or automatically. While most redpipe models are designed to look quite similar to the original models, with drones and a blowpipe, these are only included for design reasons, and some models come without either.

Unlike most Thanksgiving parades, which include giant balloons of popular characters, the America's Hometown parade has a strict theme. Each element in the parade is based on the history of the United States and arranged in chronological order, with five divisions separated by century: the colonial period of the 17th century, the Revolutionary period of the 18th century, the Civil War and pioneer periods of the 19th century, military and automotive showcases from the 20th and 21st centuries, and the closing division, the last of which includes the traditional Santa Claus float.Clark, Emily (2010-10-16).

He was the first to report Israel's destruction of Arab air forces on the opening day of the Six-Day War in 1967. CBS did not trust his report and he left. Origins Elkins was the youngest of three sons of East European Jewish immigrants who made clothes in the sweatshops of the Lower East Side. He was embarrassed that his parents spoke Yiddish and that his father walked ahead of his mother in the street. He excelled at school and educated himself in libraries. He fell in with hoodlums in New York, then moved to the American West Coast as a union organiser before joining his brother Saul to write scripts in Hollywood. He worked in Europe in the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA during the second world war. In 1947 Elkins met Teddy Kollek in New York. Kollek was later mayor of Jerusalem. In 1947 he was organising illegal shipments of arms to the Jewish Haganah in Palestine. Elkins joined in. The FBI discovered his involvement and he and his wife, Martha, fled to Israel. They lived on a kibbutz, then moved a year later to Jerusalem. Career Elkins began broadcasting with CBS in the US in September 1956. He became the network's correspondent in Israel. The previous correspondent said he was returning to the United States because \\"nothing ever happens in Israel\\". A month later Britain and France invaded Suez as Israeli tanks moved into Sinai. Elkins was the first to report Israel's destruction of Arab air forces on the first day of the Six Day War. He telephoned CBS but it hesitated to broadcast his story. The BBC ran it. Elkins had come across a politician he knew. The politician directed him to the war-room. Elkins wrote the story but Israeli military censors delayed it. Elkins proposed a deal. He would hold back the story if the censors gave him permission to be the first to broadcast when it was cleared. They agreed. CBS sent him a one-liner: \\"You alone with Israeli victory. You'd better be right.\\" Elkins visited New York in the autumn and called on CBS. He was congratulated for his scoop. \\"Get lost,\\" he said. \\"I resign.\\" He said he didn't want the job if they didn't trust him. The journalist David Sells said: :He told me once that CBS had then 'offered him the earth' to stay as their correspondent, but he had refused. 'Well done,' I enthused, praising his probity. Elkins looked at me. 'I have to tell you something, David,' he said. 'If Newsweek had not already given me the earth, I would have been sorely tempted.' That was Elkins ‚Äì tough-minded, but never stupid. Broadcasting style Elkins never modified his New York accent and growl, making him unusual among the BBC's correspondents. He spoke in a dated, epic, 1940s American radio style. His obituary in The Independent in Britain described him as \\"a master story-teller, a reporter with attitude. Even in private conversation, he spoke in vivid, well-crafted sentences. His writings translated less well to the printed page. Without the voice, they appeared a touch contrived.\\" Accusations of bias Arab lobbyists in the Middle East protested that the BBC should not employ a Jew and a Zionist to report the Arab-Israeli conflict. Elkins replied: \\"My reports are a matter of public record. If anyone can find a pattern of bias, let him say so.\\" The BBC supported him until his retirement in 1983. Jewish background The Elkins family was traditional but not deeply religious. Elkins said in a BBC talk, A Jew at Christmas, that he lost his Jewish faith when Santa Claus refused a present at Macy's department store when he was eight, saying: \\"This ain't for you, Jewboy.\\" He regained his faith, he said in the same broadcast, when he was at the liberation of Dachau in April 1945 as an American serviceman. He said he told a prisoner there that he didn't understand Yiddish; the man retorted: \\"Don't you speak the mother tongue? Aren't you a Jew?\\" \\"Elkins found that he did and he was,\\" said The Independent's obituary. Writing career Elkins wrote Forged in Fury in 1971, about the Jewish hunt for Nazi war criminals. He was not a natural author and he returned a publisher's advance after being commissioned to write an autobiography. He joined the Jerusalem Report magazine as ombudsman and letters editor in 1990 and worked for another 10 years. He was there until two days before his death.

He formerly played for Willem II, SC Veendam, Excelsior, Helmond Sport and Fortuna Sittard. Club career Hutten played as a youth for JPS in Tilburg-Noord, until joining local Eredivisie side Willem II at a young age. He was later signed by PSV at the age of 12, where he progressed through the youth system. In the 2008‚Äì09 and 2009‚Äì10 seasons, Hutten played in Jong PSV, the reserve team. On 23 September 2008, Hutten started in a KNVB Cup matchup between Jong PSV and PSV. The reserves team lost the game 0‚Äì3. In the summer of 2010, Hutten returned to his hometown to play for his former club, Willem II. The then newly appointed head coach Gert Heerkes had a spot left in the first team roster. In the preparation for the new season he made such a strong impression which meant that he made his debut in the Eredivisie in the first match of the 2010‚Äì11 season on 7 August 2010 against Heracles Almelo. Hutten played instead of the injured Pawe≈Ç Wojciechowski and was preferred over Rowin van Zaanen. On 20 July 2011, during a friendly against Fortuna Sittard, Hutten broke his metatarsal bone, which meant he was sidelined for ten weeks. After being loaned out to SC Veendam in 2012, he signed a permanent deal with the club at the expiration of his loan deal. At the end of March 2013, Veendam went bankrupt and Hutten became a free agent as a result. He trained at FC Groningen in early April 2013 together with three other former Veendam players. On 11 May 2013, it was announced that Hutten was joining Excelsior on a two-year contract. As part of that team, Hutten secured promotion to the Eredivisie in the 2013‚Äì14 season. He was loaned out to Helmond Sport for the 2014‚Äì15 season. Hutten became a free agent in July 2015 and started training at Fortuna Sittard. There, he impressed and signed a contract a one-year contract in August 2015. From 2016 he played for German Regionalliga West club SV R√∂dinghausen, before returning to Fortuna Sittard in September 2017. On 25 June 2019, TOP Oss announced the signing of Hutten on a two-year contract. International career Hutten has appeared for both the Netherlands under-19 team and under-20 team. Before, he was also a part of the under-16 and under-15 teams. He gained 14 total caps for various Dutch national youth teams.

As such, the SD15 features the 4.7 MP Foveon X3 sensor. After having showcased the camera in photokina 2008 and officially introduced during PMA 2010, it finally began shipping on June 2010. It is Sigma's fourth DSLR since the SD9 from 2002. There is some dispute over the 15.0 MP claim made by Sigma, resulting from the major differences between the industry standard Bayer sensor used in all other digital cameras, and the Foveon X3 full-color image sensor used almost exclusively in Sigma cameras. Since the Foveon sensor captures images via a three-layer red, green, blue silicone array similar to the three-layer technology used in Technicolor film, rather than the single-layer color interpolation method used by Bayer sensors, Sigma and Foveon count each RGB layer separately, so 4.7 MP times 3 translates to their 15.0 MP claims.Foveon X3 sensor Differences with the SD14 While the SD15 retains the image sensor from its predecessor, it includes the improved TRUE II image processing engine that was already implemented in the Sigma DP2. Sigma claims that the new engine offers better quality with a faster processing speed while suppressing noise through a newly developed proprietary algorithm. The combination also offers a one-stop higher ISO range compared to the SD14, though the often desaturated rendition of natural green and oversaturation of blue has been retained. The SD15 also features a larger, higher resolution LCD screen. The SD15 also introduced Color Modes. The storage medium was changed from a CF card to an SD card.

India is the last country with both lions and tigers in the wild. Historically, the modern lion and tiger co-occupied a vast portion of Eurasia, from India in the east, through northern Iran and Iraq, to the shores of the Black Sea in the west. Historically, a comparison of the tiger (Panthera tigris) versus the lion (Panthera leo) has been a popular topic of discussion by hunters, naturalists, artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination. In the past, lions and tigers reportedly competed in the wilderness, where their ranges overlapped in Eurasia. The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in captivity, either deliberately or accidentally.  Behavioral comparison  Both the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, sympatric predators, and people. Both may prey on humans, though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the tiger. General differences in behavior: * The lion is usually a social animal, while the tiger is solitary. For this reason, lions often killed tigers in captivity by ganging up on them, whereas tigers tended not to form fighting gangs. * Lions roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary, though they do socialize. During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions. More specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be promiscuous. However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary, with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating, similar to tigers, and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity in order to defend their cubs, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.  Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness  Currently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically Asiatic lions and Bengal tigers. Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past, and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild. Before the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions and Caspian tigers had occurred in other Asian or Eurasian nations, including Iran. As such, there is a word for 'Lion', which can also mean 'Tiger', and is used in Iran, South Asia and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' (), and its significance is discussed below. Not only did Heptner and Sludskiy had talk about the lion and tiger both occurring in places like Iran, Anatolia and Transcaucasia, they also mentioned that the ranges of the lion and tiger often overlapped. According to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large herbivores, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers one-against-one, as they would with each other. Apart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce hybrid offspring, which would be ligers or tigons. From the fossil record, besides genetics, it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the Pleistocene, when now-extinct relatives also existed there. Additionally, in the days before Indian Independence, the Maharaja of Gwalior introduced African lions into his area, which is a habitat for Bengal tigers. The possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project, which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the lion, that is Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, before December 2017. Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'. Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \\"trigger frequent clashes.\\" At the same, the American biologist Craig Packer and his students at the University of Minnesota considered that a group of lions (two to three males) would have a clear advantage over a tiger and a pack or lionesses (two to four females) would have a similar advantage over a tigress, despite the general advantage of the latter in weight or height. Therefore, Packer is of the opinion that for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be moved there as intact groups rather than as individuals. Although the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey, these lions are social like their African relatives, and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary. Reginald Innes Pocock (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered Northern India from the eastern end of the Himalayas, through Burma, and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from Balochistan or Persia, and spread to places like the Bengal and the Nerbudda River. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near- extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it, as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers. As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.  Observed fights  In the circuses of Ancient Rome, exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other, including Barbary lions and tigers. A mosaic in the House of the Faun in Pompeii shows a fight between a lion and a tiger. There are different accounts of which of these animals gained the victory. Although lions and tigers can be kept together in harmony in captivity, fatal conflicts have also been recorded. In addition to historical recordings, clashes between lions and tigers were reported or even caught on camera in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was not always clear which species regularly beat the other, according to Doctor Packer (2015).  In captivity  * In July 1808, Sylvanus Urban said that Mr. Bolton had a friend who claimed to have seen a fight between the lion and tiger at a circus in Verona. Though the tiger had attacked first, it yielded to the stronger lion. * In 1830, a tiger attacked a lion at a menagerie in Turin, Rome. Despite having attacked first, the lion got it on its back, and used its jaws to hold the tiger's throat. The tiger died after that. * Clark (1838) said that a British officer, who resided many years at Sierra Leone, saw many fights between lions and tigers, and that the tiger 'universally' won. * A newspaper Harper's Weekly in 1859, mentioning the same 10-minute fight in London where a tiger named 'Gunga', who had previously belonged to the King of Oude, allegedly killed nearly 30 lions and after its arrival in England, made the keepers spectators to a fight where a lion was killed in 10 minutes. A 1857 London newspaper talking about the same incident reported the lion was a \\"very fine lion, six or seven years old\\". One source stated the lion was in confinement (captivity) for three years, implying the lion would be three years old at a minimum. A newspaper talks about Gunga, whose name was also \\"Nina Shahib\\" and who, before the fight took place with the lion in London, had attacked its keeper, after which the keeper severely injured the tiger with a crowbar, blinding him in one eye, meaning the tiger would have been blind fighting the lion. The two animals were found fighting each other, in which the keepers made fruitless efforts to part the two animals. Towards the end of the fight, the lion gained a brief advantage, at which point the tiger, while on his back, with swift strikes and using his back legs, tore open the lion's stomach. The lion died after that. The tiger \\"Nina Shahib\\" was thought to have been mortally injured. However, the tiger did recover and became one of the biggest attractions of the establishment. * In 1882, a fight started in a menagerie and the tiger fixed his fangs into the lion's throat with blood gushing out, killing the lion.Newspaper * According to the Gettysburg Compiler and The Baltimore Sun (1899), towards the end of the 19th century in India, the Gaekwad of Baroda, that is Sayajirao III, arranged a fight in an amphitheater, between a Barbary lion called 'Atlas', from the Atlas Mountains between Algeria and Morocco, and a man-eating Bengal tiger from the Indian region of Shimla, both large and hungry (with their diets reduced before the fight), before an audience of thousands, instead of between an Indian lion and the tiger, as Indian lions were believed to be no match for Bengal tigers. The tiger was more than long, over feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile. The lion looked taller at the head than the tiger, and had a large mane, legs and paws. The tiger was seen as \\"the personification of graceful strength and supple energy,\\" whereas the lion was seen as the \\"embodiment of massive power and adamantine muscle\\". In the fight, both cats sustained injuries, and although the tiger sometimes retreated from Atlas, it would come back to fight it, and in the end, managed to scratch Atlas to death, though Atlas pushed it off in one final move before dying. The Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 rupees, accepted that the tiger was the \\"King of the Cat Family,\\" decreed that Atlas' body be given a Royal burial, and that the tiger should have a \\"cage of honour\\" in the menagerie of Baroda, and decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran grizzly bear weighing more than . The battle was to happen after the tiger recovered from its wounds. * At the Coney Island animal show in 1909, a performing lion attacked a chained tiger by leaping through the air, landing on the tiger's back. Though hampered by the heavy neck chain fastened to the iron bars of the arena, the tiger was more than a match for the lion and mangled it to death. * In 1911, Bostock gave an account of a lion killing a tiger. * In May 1914, at New York's Bronx Zoo, the barrier between the cages of Rajah, an eight-year- old Bengal tiger, and Huerte, a Nubian lion which was two or three years old and had been sick for some time, got opened in an \\"unaccountable manner.\\" For the first few minutes, the more agile Huerte appeared to be winning, but when it aimed for its injured opponent's neck, about an hour into the fight, Rajah aimed for its nape. Not only did Rajah manage to bite Huerte's nape, but it also broke Huerte's back, thus slaughtering it. * In 1934, a fully grown African lion killed a mature Bengal tiger a short time after these circus animals were unloaded from the train and before trainers could separate them. * Bert Nelson (1938) said that in Chicago, when 20 lions and tigers were mixed together for an act at a circus, a fight occurred, lasting for about 10 minutes. No fatalities were mentioned, but Nelson said that order was 'restored' when the tigers used escape doors to flee. * At the South Perth Zoo in 1949, in a three-minute fight between a lion and a tiger, the lion killed the tiger. The fight occurred when the tiger put his head through a connecting slide. The lion caught the tiger by the throat, and, dragging it through the opening, killed it before the keepers arrived. * An Indian prince organised a filmed fight in a deep pit in the compound of his palace. The lion had killed the tiger, according to Kailash Sankhala (1978). * In September 2010, a Bengal tiger at the Ankara Zoo passed through a gap, between its cage and that of a lion, and killed it with a single paw swipe. \\"The tiger severed the lion's jugular vein in a single stroke with its paw, leaving the animal dying in a pool of blood,\\" officials said. However, despite being reported in local news at the time, the incident was reported in international media in March 2011. = Clyde Beatty = A tigress running out of Beatty's circus chute into a cage occupied by a woman with a stick. The figure of Clyde Beatty's 50 tigers killed by lions includes the following: * In 1934, \\"Pasha\\", a female tiger, attacked Clyde Beatty, only to have \\"Nero\\" the male lion attack the tigress and save Beatty's life in an ensuing 25-minute fight.FULCO * In 1933, Beatty said that 16 tigers were killed because lions fight in gangs and tigers fight alone.Macksville Nambucca And Bellinger News, August 25, 1933, Page 4 * Up to 1933 in his career Beatty stated, \\"I have had many lion-tiger battles in my arena, but they have always been gang fights.\\" He continued further, mentioning a tigress named \\"Nellie\\" who was killed in a fight involving her and another tiger against eight lions, and another fight between 17 lions and 12 tigers, in which three tigers were killed. Beatty continued in the interview: \\"However, these fights prove nothing, for lions help each other in a fight, while a tiger picks an opponent in one of these free-for-all battles and fights it out with that animal, who usually gets help from one of his lion buddies\\". * Beatty starred in the 1933 film The Big Cage in which fights between his lions and tigers were both done. The first fight was between Sultan the lion and Tommy the tiger, in which the lion killed the tiger.Trove The second tiger that was killed by a lion was Bobby, which fought Caesar the lion. On page 33, Beatty states that he threw ammonia into Bobby's face, because they wanted to stir the fight up, stating that it was an old animal trainer trick \\"seldom [used] because of the obvious discomfort it causes the animals\\", at the end of the page saying that \\"Bobby, [was] pawing at his nose as though trying to get the fumes out of it\\", showing that it interfered with the fight, but later on, Beatty states that Bobby continued fighting, lunging at Caesar four more times, though after Caesar made a maneuver to avoid Bobby's fourth strike, Caesar managed to seize Bobby by the neck and kill it. * In 1936, it is reported that Beatty recalled an event in his circus where a lion named \\"Boss Tweed\\" died after being injured in a fight with three tigers which it reportedly killed, after they ran into the chute where it was. The newspaper stated that Beatty recalled that three tigers and one male lion fought in the circus chute in which the animals enter and leave the arena. * In 1937, the Chicago Tribune reporter asked Beatty about one-on-one fights; he then stated he did not stage many of those as it was too expensive...but then says he had had plenty of such fights happen accidentally, and usually before he could stop it, one of the cats was dead. He went on to say that since 1927, 25 tigers were killed by lions, and no lions were killed by tigers.Y In another article in 1937, Beatty stated how the tiger started off faster, but when its flurry subsided, the lion mopped up, never leaving until its antagonist was dead. * Sehka, a three-year-old Bengal tigress in Beatty's circus \\"died of wounds suffered when she was attacked by Memphis, a lion in the act\\". * In 1940, Beatty talked about a case saying that while a tiger was performing, Nero the lion jumped from his pedestal, hit the tiger with a crash, stunning the big cat and sunk his teeth into the tiger's back. Evidently the fight was unfair, as it was an ambush. * As Beatty stated in his book, Princess the tigress was dying in a \\"brief encounter with the maned enemy [male lion].\\" * Beatty mentioned a case where Empress the tigress was killed by Detroit the lion. *In Beatty's book, he talked about a case where \\"Sleika\\", a female tiger, was severely injured in a fight with Detroit the lion, had a broken back and died two days later. * Beatty stated that Puna, a male tiger who was known for being very friendly and even going up to his \\"natural enemies\\" [male lions] and be affectionate towards them, who was then killed in one of his \\"good will\\" moments by a lion. * A tiger by the name of \\"Poona\\" was killed by two lions in a \\"two-against-one battle\\".Newspapers * In 1951, Prince the lion killed two tigresses, Sheba and Rosie.NValley Morning Star March 3, 1951 Page 1 * In 1952, Juno the male lion reportedly killed 13 tigers and five lions.Eureka Humboldt Times May 24, 1952 Page 3Albany Democrat-Herald from Albany, Oregon June 11, 1952 Page 3 It is unclear if Juno killed these animals directly or if he was simply part of the killing (such as several lions killing a tiger) and Beatty counted it. A newspaper from the beginning of 1952 stated that Juno was involved in a fight with six other lions, in which four of the lions \\"bore bloody wounds from the battle.\\" It also stated that Juno ambushed another lion by jumping on it from behind.The Press Democrat Wednesday, February 6, 1952 Page: 7Juno was said to be one of the largest and finest specimens of Barbary lions in captivity.Santa Cruz Sentinel Thursday, May 8, 1952 Page 6 * In 1954, a tiger was killed in a melee while Beatty was trying to separate \\"two ferocious fellows\\".N It is unclear if the tiger was killed fighting a male lion or not, as it does not clarify the animals that were in the fight. * In 1955, France the lion reportedly killed two tigers in Beatty's circus.Council Bluffs Nonpariel (Council Bluffs, Ioqa) 15 Sep. 1955 Page 6 There is no information given about the fights or on the tigers. * In 1960, Beatty had a tiger named \\"Sabre\\" who killed two lions.Berkshire Eagle June 13, 1960 Page 13 In the mid-1930s, Beatty took lionesses out of the act, meaning the lions could have been males.Facing the Big Cats, by Clyde Beatty, page 102  In the wilderness  Mughal painting of a Dervish with a lion and tiger in India * Herne (1855) mentioned that in the Indian jungle between the village of Elaw, city of Baroche, and Gulf of Cambay, north of the city of Surat and its Ghauts, about from the village, he and his party, which included locals, heard a tiger's roar. Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about , they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as \\"tyrants of the forest,\\" given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's throat, turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the \\"King of Beasts.\\" Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims. * The Sun (New York) reported that in a depopulated Indian village at the bank of a creek connected to the Cauvery River, about north-west of Bangalore, a hunter injured by a venomous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a \\"rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,\\" and had muscular limbs. The male lion was \\"medium-sized.\\" Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry cat, which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary, but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like that of dogs unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, limping into the forest. * Rivalry between the Asiatic lion and \\"Siberian tiger\\" is mentioned in Hamilton M. Wright's work in The San Francisco Call (1911).  Opinions = Favoring the tiger  * Alex Kerr, an animal trainer who has worked with both lions and tigers, stated in his book that tigers will nearly always win in a fight with a lion and will prove the stronger fighter.No Bars Between, by Alex Kerr, page 130 * John Varty, owner of the Londolozi Reserve in South Africa, said, \\"People always ask me which one is bigger? If a tiger and a lion had a fight, which one would win? Well, I've seen tigers crunch up a full-grown leopard tortoise like it was nothing. And lions try, but they just don't get it right. If there's a fight, the tiger will win, every time.\\" * The animal rescue organisation Big Cat Rescue of Tampa, Florida answered, \\"While it would depend on the size, age, and aggressiveness of the specific animals involved, generally tigers have a significant advantage.\\" * The conservation charity Save China's Tigers stated \\"Recent research indicates that the tiger is indeed stronger than the lion in terms of physical strength. Lions hunt in prides, so it would be in a group and the tiger as a solitary creature so it would be on its own. A tiger is generally physically larger than a lion. Most experts would favor a Siberian and Bengal tiger over an African lion.\\" * John Smith Clarke, a British lion tamer, said, in a lecture on the fight between a tiger and a lion given to the Glasgow Zoological Society, while showing the actual fight on the screen, \\"in 100 cases out of 100, the tiger would always beat the lion. It was far more agile, it was not so clumsy in its movements, it was equally strong, it was equally armed, but it fought in a different way. The tiger very often fought rolling on its back and held the lion in its grip until it defeated him.\\" * Craig Saffoe, a biologist and the curator of great cats at the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., said that the outcome of a given fight totally depended on the individuals, with their fighting style, physiology and history, but that he would bet on the tiger winning. He also reckoned that the big cats ranked, from higher to lower, with tigers, jaguars and lions on top, and then cougars, snow leopards, leopards, and cheetahs. At the same time, he said that the most interesting \\"match-up would be a good size Bengal tiger and a good-size male jaguar,\\" because they had roughly the same speed, temperament, strength and size and strength, in his opinion.  Favoring the lion  * Clyde Beatty, the animal trainer and performer who owned several tigers, lions, hyenas, and other exotic animals, believed that in nine out of 10 times, \\"a full-grown lion would whip a full-grown tiger\\". * Dave Hoover, the animal trainer for Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus, mentions that he lost many tigers to male lions: \\"I have to keep the male lions from killing each other. I have to keep them from killing the tigers [...]. I have lost tigers.\\" Although Dave Hoover had his lions gang up on his tigers, \\"Two lions killed one of his tigers during training in Ojus, Fla., in 1966\\", in another newspaper he states he as trouble \\"keeping the lion from attacking the lone tiger\\". *Renowned naturalist and conservationist of India, Kailash Sankhala wrote in his book Tiger that the tiger would be unable to get close to lion's vital joints because of his thick mane, and that the tiger would be vulnerable to the lion. He mentioned that once an Indian prince organized a fight in which the lion killed the tiger, and opined that \\"a tiger is no match for even single lion of equal strength\\". * Trainer Bert Nelson, who witnessed a struggle between lions and tigers, said that a tiger would surrender 'sooner' than a lion.  Neutral  * Carl Hagenbeck, a trainer from Hamburg, said that the lion and tiger were alike in \\"good temper and reliability\\". He cited the example of a lion being trained for a month to do tricks, and of a tiger taking five weeks to do so.  Arts and literature = Art  Battles between the two were painted in the 18th and 19th centuries by Eug√®ne Delacroix, George Stubbs and James Ward. Ward's paintings, which portrayed lion victories in accordance with the lion's symbolic value in Great Britain, have been described as less realistic than Stubbs. The British Seringapatam medal shows a lion defeating a tiger in battle; an Arabic language banner on the medal displays the words Asad AllƒÅh al-GhƒÅlib (, \\"Lion of God the Conqueror\\"). The medal commemorated the British victory at the 1799 Battle of Seringapatam (in the town now known as Srirangapatna) over Tipu Sultan ‚Äî who used tigers as emblems, as opposed to the British emblematic use of lions.

Note that the lion comes first in the list, and that it is referred to as the \\"Magnanimous King of Bea Ét\\" (sic). 18th- century naturalists and authors compared the species' characters, generally in favor of the lion. Oliver Goldsmith ranked the lion first among carnivorous mammals, followed by the tiger, which in his view \\"seems to partake of all the noxious qualities of the lion, without sharing any of his good ones. To pride, courage and strength, the lion joins greatness, clemency and generosity; but the tiger is fierce without provocation, and cruel without necessity.\\" Charles Knight, writing in The English Cyclopaedia, disparaged the opinions of naturalists Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and Thomas Pennant in this context, stating \\"the general herd of authors who eulogise the 'courage, greatness, clemency and generosity' of the lion, contrasting it with the unprovoked ferocity, unnecessary cruelty and poltroonery of the tiger, becomes ridiculous, though led by such names as Buffon and Pennant.\\" * English literature compared their battle strengths. The poets Edmund Spenser, Allan Ramsey, and Robert Southey described lion victories. In the view of a 19th- century literary critic, these contests established \\"sovereignty of the animal world.\\" * According to John Hampden Porter (1894, page 176), Lockington said that the jaguar reigned 'supreme' as the \\"terror of the forest,\\" and that this applied to the lion and tiger in the 'desert' and 'jungle', respectively. In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Narada told Srinjaya that tigers were fiercer and more ruthless than lions. This is in contrast with other literature from ancient India, which prefers the lion to the tiger. For example, Vedic literature depicted the lion, rather than the tiger, as the \\"king of the forest.\\" The lion and tiger rival each other in Iranian literature. For example, Humphreys and Kahrom, in their 1999 book Lion and Gazelle: The Mammals and Birds of Iran, treated them as the \\"two greatest and most beautiful\\" of Iranian carnivores, albeit being extinct there. As with the lion, the tiger's Persian name was used for people and places.  Economics  The term \\"tiger economy\\" has been applied to Asian countries that have undergone rapid economic growth, and the term \\"lion economy\\" to their African counterparts. The two sides, nicknamed \\"Asian tigers\\" and \\"African lions\\", have also been compared.  Cinema  In Paalai, a 2011 Tamil film, there is dialogue about the characteristics of the tiger and lion. It concludes that the tiger is superior. In the film, the tiger is the symbol and flag of the native Tamil tribal people and the lion is the symbol and flag of non-Tamil Singhal (literally meaning 'Leonine') people.

West Wickham Court, Kent Lennard was the son of Sir Stephen Lennard, 1st Baronet of West Wickham and his third wife Anne Oglander, daughter of John Oglander of Nunwell House, Nunwell, Isle of Wight. He married Elizabeth Roy, widow of John Roy of Woodlands, Dorset, and daughter of Delalyne Hussey of Shapwick, Dorset after a settlement of 30 December 1671. He was Commissioner for assessment for Kent and Surrey from 1677 to 1680, and appointed deputy lieutenant for Kent in 1679. On 29 January 1680, he succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father and was subsequently appointed a JP. Lennard was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Winchelsea in a contest at the 1681 English general election but took little part in proceedings. He was a colonel of the militia by 1683. He did not stand at the 1685 English general election. He was dismissed from all his local offices in February 1688 because he failed to answer the three questions, on account of ‚Äòillness‚Äô. However he was restored as JP and colonel of militia in October 1688 and was Commissioner of Assessment for Kent from 1689 to 1690 and deputy lieutenant from 1689 for the rest of his life. At the 1698 English general election, Lennard was returned unopposed as MP for Kent. He did not stand again in the 1701 elections. He was next returned for Kent again as a Whig in a contest at the 1708 British general election. He supported the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and, on 12 December 1709, he was added to a committee drafting a local turnpike bill. On 14 December the House of Commons voted to impeach Dr Sacheverell, and he was heard to comment that they were going ‚Äòto roast a parson‚Äô. Lennard dropped dead of apoplexy aged 72 on 15 December 1709, the day after his comment, while walking in Drury Lane, London. He was buried at West Wickham.

According to the the Senate consists of the Governing Mayor of Berlin and up to ten senators appointed by the governing mayor, two of whom are appointed (deputy) mayors. The Senate meets weekly at the Rotes Rathaus (Red Town Hall).Virtueller Rundgang: 7. Senatssitzungssaal, Berlin.de History The Brandenburg municipalities of Alt-Berlin and C√∂lln had received town privileges in the 13th century and from 1307 on shared a common administration, but were divided after the elector subjected the city (following the idea of divide and rule) and made it his residential city in 1448. King Frederick I of Prussia by resolution finally had both towns, and three later founded adjacent cities,These were , Dorotheenstadt, and Friedrichstadt. merged and elevated to the \\"Royal Capital and Residence City of Berlin\\" as of 1 January 1710. Rotes Rathaus, seat of the Berlin Senate From the Prussian reforms of 1808 until 1933, Berlin (expanded to Greater Berlin in 1920) was governed by a Magistrat (compulsorily dissolved by Nazi act on 15 March 1933), which was the executive committee of the Stadtverordnetenversammlung (city council; last convened on 27 June 1933)T.H. Elkins with B. Hofmeister, Berlin: The Spatial Structure of a Divided City, London: Methuen, 1988, , e-edition Taylor & Francis 2005, , p. 11. and was represented in each of the boroughs of Berlin by a local office (usually housed in the town hall of a formerly independent suburb).Elkins, p. 23. The council was headed by a Lord Mayor, or Oberb√ºrgermeister. Lord Mayor Heinrich Sahm, elected in 1931, remained in office, and joined the NSDAP in November 1933, but resigned in 1935. His power totally depended on Julius Lippert, on 25 March 1933 appointed as Prussian State Commissioner for Berlin. So Berlin was de facto under the ultimate governance of the Nazi regime. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, Berlin was to be under the ultimate governance of the Allied Kommandatura. However, in the election of 20 October 1946, the city elected an SPD-majority Stadtverordnetenversammlung and an SPD mayor (Otto Ostrowski, resigned 1947). The second elected SPD mayor, the devoted anti- communist Ernst Reuter, was vetoed by the Soviet commander, so Louise Schroeder (SPD) officiated as only acting lord mayor. The Western allies permitted the Berlin SPD to hold a referendum on whether to merge with the Communist party to form a unified single party of the left, the Socialist Unity Party, as realised under pressure in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, and the members voted against the merger.Elkins, pp. 34‚Äì35. Neues Stadthaus: Plaque commemorating the 1948 Communist putsch This was unacceptable to the Soviets, who engineered the establishment of an alternative city council in the sector under their direct control.Elkins, p. 37. Following the Berlin Blockade, the Soviet sector, which became known as East Berlin (and the capital of the German Democratic Republic as of October 1949) and the three western sectors (British, French, and U.S.) were functionally separated following the attempted Communist putsch in Berlin's city government in September 1948 (a situation formalised in the Four Power Agreement on Berlin of 1971). Under the new constitution of West Berlin which came into force on 1 September 1950, Berlin was defined as a state of the Federal Republic of Germany; however, due to the Allied veto, its representatives in the federal parliament (and later in the European parliament) were not directly elected by the citizenry, but appointed by the Berlin parliament (Abgeordnetenhaus) and had no voting power, but a merely advisory vote in those parliaments.Elkins, p. 40. On the model of the two Hanseatic city-states within the Federal Republic, Hamburg and Bremen,Europa World Year Book 2004 Volume 1, New York: Taylor & Francis, , p. 1845. the Berlin Senate, chosen by the parties represented in the Berlin parliament, was established to perform the functions of a state government,Jan Edmund Osmanczyk and Anthony Mango, Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements: A to F, New York: Taylor & Francis, 2002, , p. 191. with each of its members heading a department, equivalent to a state ministry, and a Regierender B√ºrgermeister (Governing or Executive Mayor) at its head and one B√ºrgermeister as his/her deputy. In the 1950 constitution the maximum number of senators was 16,Elkins, pp. 41‚Äì42.Alexandra Richie, Faust's Metropolis: A History of Berlin, New York: Carroll & Graf, 1998, , p. 774. then each elected by the parliament, but the first Senate had 13.Ann Tusa, The Last Division: a History of Berlin, 1945‚Äì1989, Reading, Massachusetts: Addison Wesley, 1997, , p. 35. Neues Stadthaus Thus, following the Hanseatic tradition, the Lord Mayor was only primus inter pares as he and the senators had an elected mandate, therefore the Lord Mayor could not dismiss any senator. Senators could however be removed from their seats by the Parliament. Until 1990 all elected Mayors and Senators had to have their positions confirmed by the Allied commanders of West Berlin. Since both the building then used as the town hall of Berlin, (the ), and the Rotes Rathaus (which had been destroyed and was not rebuilt until 1956) were in East Berlin, the Senate met at the former town hall of Sch√∂neberg, Rathaus Sch√∂neberg.Elkins, p. 169. During the transition to a reunified Germany in 1990, a new Magistrat was elected in East Berlin and a Senate appointed in West Berlin, and they jointly governed as a Landesregierung aus Senat und Magistrat (state government of Senate and Magistrat, known popularly as the MagiSenat),Eckardt D.

With the completion of reunification on 3 October 1990, the MagiSenat became a unified Berlin Senate, no longer depending on Allied confirmation.

Established in 1821, this regiment is mostly a ceremonial unit, being the escort security regiment of the President of Bolivia. This is the Bolivian Army's most represented unit, having a close connection with the Bolivian people, whatever their race, and has a contribution to national history.Mazacotte, Alejandro (1983). Ensayo sobre la Guerra del Chaco. Asuncion (Paraguay): NAPA.Querejazu Calvo, Roberto (1981). Masamaclay. Historia pol√≠tica, diplom√°tica y militar de la guerra del Chaco. Cochabamba-La Paz (Bolivia): Los Amigos del Libro. Organization The Colorados Regiment contains two infantry battalions; the BI-201 (Protocol Unit) and BI-202 (Security) with their respective headquarters. The headquarters Calama is located in the street of the same name, which operates the unit headquarters and recruitment center. The Mirador headquarters in the hill of Quilli Quilli, Pav√≥n Villa area, is a center for training in various areas of specialization such as assault, support, personal protection, first aid, etc. History=Raising of the Colorados The Regiment was raised in 1821 as the nation, then as part of both the Viceroy of Lima and the then United Provinces of the Rio del Plata, was fighting the Spanish American wars of independence as guerrilla units siding with the Buenos Aires and Lima independent governments then. In 1821, the Colorados Regiment's first references were to a militia unit led by the Upper Peru guerrilla leader, Jose Miguel Lanza, and had among its rosters future national heroes of Bolivia like Jose Ballivian, Mariano Torrelio, and Manuel Deheza, who were fighting for Upper Peru's independence from Spain. The 1850s and 1860s It was in 1857 when the Colorados made their appearance as the 39th Line Infantry Battalion \\"Colorados\\" under the leadership of then regimental commander Placido Yanez. It was the Bolivian Army's elite infantry unit, and was known then for its extreme discipline. Col. Yanez made the regiment's famous slogan: \\"The love of the arms enters the heart\\". By then, the battalion would begin to be the principal unit of the Bolivian Army, and under the administration of President Hilarion Daza it became the presidential escort and security unit. It would later earn the nickname \\"Daza's Colorados\\" for this reason alone. It was then composed of 570 personnel. Most of them were his friends and relatives, all but sometimes members of the Bolivian Army as enlisted personnel and non- commissioned officers while only a few were officers. War of the Pacific: Actions at Tacna During the War of the Pacific, Bolivia alongside Peru, fought for their respective nations' mining interests against the Chilean forces. Bolivia's contributions to the war included 2 cavalry squadrons, an artillery battery, and three infantry battalions, all equipped with fusils and rifles, among them being the Bolivian Colorados. They formed the Bolivian Army under President Daza's leadership as Commander in Chief. As part of the combined Bolivian-Peruvian Allied Army, the Bolivian Colorados contributed their hard work to bring victory to the combined armies, at the cost of many lives. The Colorados were in action in some of the great battles of the war, including the Battle of San Francisco (also known as Battle of Dolores) where the Camarones betrayal happened, and the Battle of Tacna, where it was listed and then renamed as the 1st Alliance Infantry Battalion, now part of the forces under the new army chief President Narciso Campero. Most of the time however, before the fighting in Tacna, it was always on the reserve, due to the belated formations of infantry battalions. May 26 is Infantry Day in Bolivia in recognition of the Colorados' bravery throughout the whole battle of Tacna, led by regimental commander Colonel Ildefonso Murguia Anze and regimental drummer Juan Pinto. This battle was where the Colorados shouted their battle cry: Temblad rotos, que aqui entran los Colorados de Bolivia! (Rotos, be shaken, because the Colorados of Bolivia have come!) and formed a gallant defense alongside their Peruvian allies. Every year (except in 2009) the Colorados come back to the place of their glorious exploits to commemorate the Bolivians' gallantry and courage seen in this battle. In 2004, through Law 2922 of President of Bolivia Carlos Mesa, the Regiment's actions in Tacna were rewarded with all who were in the Regiment in that battle serving under the colors were officially declared as National Heroes of Bolivia. Actions in Acre As part of the National Army of Bolivia in 1903 (led by the President of Bolivia Jose Manuel Pando), it fought in the Acre War for Bolivian control of that region. The War for the Chaco: Bravery in Ca√±ada Strongest Its second act of bravery to the flag was, when in the Battle of Ca√±ada Strongest during the Chaco War, the Bolivian Colorados, now a full regiment of infantry, fought against the Paraguayan army and came out in triumph, having captured the 3rd Btn., Lomas Valentinas Regiment of the Paraguayan Army. It also took part in other Bolivian actions during the war. Guerrilla wars in the 1960s As one of the Bolivian Army's missions is for internal security, it is no wonder that the Colorados were involved in anti-guerrilla operations, supported by the United States, against the guerrillas led by Che Guevara in 1967 in places like Nancahuazu, Ovelo, El Espino, and many others. Regimental Motto Traditionally, Subordinacion y Constancia, ¬°Viva Bolivia! (Subordination and Steadfastness. Long Live Bolivia!) is the regimental motto, and concurrently that of the Armed Forces of Bolivia, but in 2010 ¬°Patria o Muerte, Venceremos! (Fatherland or Death, we'll triumph!), the slogan made famous by Ernesto Che Guevara, became the new motto by President Evo Morales, in line with the socialist stance of his government and party. Among the opposition, the change of motto to the socialist one used by him in 1967 during his guerrilla war in the country has been met with criticism, even among former armed forces chiefs. Che brought the motto to Bolivia during his guerrilla campaigns here. During Hugo Chavez's visit to Cochabamba on April 22, 2010, the Colorados formed the guard of honor during the arrival ceremonies. When he shouted Patria o Muerte twice, the Colorados didn't respond or say a word.https://www.eluniverso.com/2010/04/22/1/1361/tropa- boliviana-responde-silencio-hugo- chavez.html?amp&device;=mobilehttps://rpp.pe/mundo/actualidad/guardia- boliviana-no-respondio-al-patria-o-muerte-de-chavez-noticia-259463 The regiment's other motto is A paso de vencedores, Temblad rotos, que aqui entran los Colorados de Bolivia, Vencer o Morir, carajo! (To the pace of the victorious, Be shaken, Rotos, for because the Colorados of Bolivia have come, Victory or Death, bastards!) Presently the motto has been reinstated in the Armed Forces but in the light of the bigger struggle for the recovery of the nation's right for access to the Pacific Ocean, which was lost during the War of the Pacific, is now amended to: Subordinacion y Constancia, ¬°Viva Bolivia, hacia el Mar! (Subordination and Steadfastness. Long Live Bolivia, up to the Sea!) Regimental arms and colour guidons The arms is round with a picture of a kneeling soldier of the Colorados in full dress uniform in the middle, with a rainbow above him. The new regimental colour guidon (since 2010) has the arms in the center, in the middle of the national colors of the Wiphala, the new colour of the Bolivian Armed Forces, and also has the regiment's foundation date (and the year of the new guidon when it was received) in white lettering below the heraldic arms. The regiment's second guidons (for companies) is in red with the standard arms of Bolivian infantry regiments: a Stahlhelm with the national flag (and nowadays a sticker of the Wiphala) on top in the middle of two crossed sabres, with the regiment's title surrounding it, written in white lettering. Regimental dress uniform Members of the Colorado Regiment guard the tomb of Andr√©s de Santa Cruz in La Paz The dress uniform of the Colorados is a red long sleeved standing collar tunic with a red small kepi hat, epaulette, sword strap and set (for officers), long khaki- tan trousers and black boots.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History The first area Odd Fellows lodge was established in 1866 in what was then the village of Portsmouth, and is now a section of Bay City. The Portsmouth Lodge No. 104 was chartered the following year. Lodge members soon voted to move to Bay City, and the name changed to Bay Lodge No. 104 in 1869. The city grew, and five more lodges were spun off from the Bay Lodge. The second of these was Valley Lodge No. 189, founded in 1872 and chartered in 1873. Along with Excelsior Lodge No. 30, Daughters of Rebekah, the Valley lodge met in a series of rented quarters until 1898, when they moved into their own building located at this site. By the mid-1920s Lodge membership was peaking, and the Valley Lodge constructed a new, larger headquarters in 1928. The building was funded by local philanthropist Mendel J. Bialy, and designed by architect Averton E. Munger. Both the Valley Lodge and the Excelsior Lodge continued to use the building for over 50 years. However, Odd Fellows membership was declining, and in 1979 the Odd Fellows vacated the building. The city considered renovating the building as a police station after it was purchased by the city in 2004 to save it from demolition. The city sold it in 2009 for $8,000 to a local developer who planned to restore it for use by a vocational school. The second floor was partially collapsed at that time. However, in 2015, the owner was convicted of tax fraud, throwing the future of the building into doubt. Description The Valley Lodge Building is a two-story rectangular steel- frame Classical Revival building, clad with red, buff, and whitish brick walls and accented with cast concrete trim. It has a flat roof and stands on foundation walls built of concrete and fieldstone. The building is sited on a corner. The red brick front facade is symmetrical, with a slightly projecting, narrow central section that contains a double-door entryway. Storefronts topped with slightly projecting cornices flank the entryway. Above, the entry projection is flanked by large rectangular panels containing a single double- hung window set in an arched-head surround. A low parapet runs across the top. The side facade has a recessed entry and three large tripartite windows in the first floor and a single small window in the second. Inside, the lodge has a small stair to the second floor inside the entryway. To either side on the first floor is retail space, which runs about half the length of the building. Behind are former lodge club room on one side and furnace room and office on the other. Another rear stair leads to the second floor. The second floor contains a large lodge room occupying most of the floor. The lodge room has a small stage and two tiers of theater seats set on risers along the wall on either side, with a level floor in the center. The room is lit by large rectangular skylights in the center of the room.

Legend of Rhitta Gawr A well- known tale concerns Rhitta (or Rhudda) Gawr, a giant who held court in Snowdonia. He marched against warring kings Nyniaw and Peibaw, overwhelmed their armies and took their beards as trophies of his victory and fashioned them into a cap for himself. The twenty-six kings of Britain assembled their armies to destroy Rhitta but were vanquished by the giant, who cut off the kings' beards and fashioned a great cape out of them to protect him from the cold. Sometime later, as Arthur \\"washed his hands after slaying the red-eyed giant of Cernyw\\", he received a message from Rhitta, demanding his beard to patch his cloak. Arthur refused, and Rhitta marched south with his armies to claim it from him. In the resulting confrontation, Rhitta is forced to shear his own beard, and retreats \\"much humbled in stature but much wiser in knowledge\\". A variant tale claims that after receiving the demands, Arthur marched furiously up to Snowdonia and fought against the giant in a duel, in which he \\"lifted up his sword and struck Rhitta on the crown of the head a blow so fiercely-wounding, severely-venomous and sternly-smiting that it cut through all his head armour and his skin and his flesh and clove him in twain.\\", The Mantle of Kings' Beards According to the story, Arthur commands that a cairn be built over his body which forms Gwyddfa Rhudda (Rhita's Cairn). Over the intervening centuries the name of Rhudda was forgotten and Gwyddfa Rhudda became known as Yr Wyddfa. The Capture of Maelor Gawr Maelor Gawr, the giant of Castell Maelor (now the village of Penparcau), was captured in Cyfeilog, about twelve miles from his own castle and was sentenced to death. His enemies allowed him his final request to blow on his horn three times before his death. The first time he blew, his hair and beard fell out, and on the second blast of his horn, so great was the strength and force of the sounding that all his finger and toe-nails fell off completely. On the third blast of his horn the intensity of the force of the sound caused the horn to be broken into small pieces. Maelor's son, Cornippin, who was hunting with his horse and his hound, heard the sound of his father's hand and lamented over his suffering. He made to rescue his father and in riding with such haste and swiftness, he tore the head of his hound off its body. He spurred his horse onwards, leaped in one great bound over the Ystwyth river and attacked his father's captors. In the ensuing battle, Cornippin was slain. Cribwr Gawr Cribwr the Giant lived in Castell Cefn Cribwr in Morgannwg. His three sisters were all killed by Arthur through \\"treachery\\". Arthur succeeded in slaying the giantesses by nicknaming himself as \\"Hot Pottage\\" to the first sister, and \\"Warm Porridge\\" to the second sister and as \\"a morsel of bread\\" to the third, and when the first sister called for help against Hot Pottage Cribwr answered: Wench, let him cool; and in the same manner he answered the second sister, when she sought assistance against Warm Porridge. And the third sister called out that the Morsel of Bread was choking her; and to this he answered, Wench, take a smaller piece. And when Cribwr reproached Arthur for killing his sisters Arthur replied: Cribwr take thy combs And cease with currish anger If I get a real chance‚Äîsurely What they have had, thou shalt have too.

The tall mounds are commonly thought to be more than 5,000 years old, and one estimate places them at 11,300 years old. They predate the Great Pyramids of Egypt, and are believed to be the oldest surviving man-made structure in the Americas, or possibly the whole world. History The mounds were built thousands of years ago on a spot overlooking the floodplain of the Mississippi River in what is now Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the site of Louisiana State University. The northern mound consists of hard clay dirt; the southern mound is more porous. The scholarly consensus is that they were used for \\"ceremonial and marking point purposes,\\" rather than for burial. They are part of a larger, statewide system of mounds. They were first dated in 1982. In 2009, LSU professor Brooks Ellwood took core samples that revealed a layer of charcoal, possibly from a pit barbecue or a cremation. Additional excavation work was done in 2011, 2012, and 2018. Based on his analysis of the material found within the mounds, Ellwood conjectures that they contain cremated human remains and are substantially older than the existing consensus, as much as 11,300 years old.  Preservation  Due to their location in a heavily trafficked area of campus, the mounds began to show signs of degradation as well as natural erosion. To alleviate the issue, the university installed a sidewalk between the mounds in 1985. In addition, a low brick wall was placed around the mounds in order to prevent vehicles from dangerously crossing the mounds. Erosion continued to take its toll until a restoration project was initiated in 1996. Using river silt, the LSU Facility Services patched damage on both mounds and seeded a hybrid Bermuda grass to prevent future problems. The mounds were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 1, 1999. with two photos With . In 2010, LSU announced the \\"Save the Mounds\\" campaign to preserve the mounds. Officials from the school stated that the mounds had suffered internal structural damage that would lead to their eventual collapse. While they were formerly used for tailgate parties, in 2010 they began to be fenced off during LSU's home football games to prevent them from being damaged.

It was built by the Rhenish Railway Company and commenced operations on 23 August 1866. History  Following the development of railways on the left bank (the part of the 19th century Prussian Rhine Province that was west of the Rhine) from Cologne to Kleve (the West Lower Rhine line), Aachen (the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line) and Bingerbr√ºck (the West Rhine railway ) by the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, RhE) investigated, under its President, Gustav von Mevissen, a rail connection to serve the coal mines in the Ruhr district. The very lucrative coal traffic there was then only served by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (C√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, CME) and the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company (Bergisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft, BME). Construction of the train ferry operation Planning began in 1860 on a new railway line from Osterath on the Cologne‚ÄìKrefeld line over the Rhine to Essen and later on to Dortmund. Prior to the Austro-Prussian War, the Prussian military opposed the building of a fixed bridge across the Rhine for military reasons, except in fortified cities such as Cologne, Mainz, Koblenz and D√ºsseldorf. Therefore, a ferry was needed between the left bank in the current Duisburg districts of Rheinhausen and Hochfeld. The Prussian government concession for the railway was issued on 9 March 1863 and the concession for the ferry was issued on 16 July 1863. Construction of the railway commenced immediately. Before commencing work on the ferry, the Rhenish Railway waited for the completion of its Spyck‚ÄìWelle train ferry so that it could use technology being tested there. The Rhenish Railway Company expected a high volume of traffic and planned to operate five ferries. It would have five ramps for ferry pontoons with passenger carriages and freight wagons crossing independently between two wire ropes over the Rhine. In fact, however, only four ferries were placed in service. The tracks were laid on ramps with a slope of 1 in 48 down to the marshalling yards on both banks of the river. The major basins were dredged to keep the moorings clear. Pontoon loaded with carriages on a trip across the Rhine Five pontoons for the transport of wagons were ordered from Cologne Maschinenbau AG (a subsidiary of the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company) in Cologne-Bayenthal. The 47 metre-long pontoons, Ruhr, Lahn and Mosel could carry eight freight wagons cars or five carriages. The fourth pontoon, the 63 metre-long Rhein carried ten freight wagons or seven carriages. The fifth pontoon, Eisponte carried five wagons. A 30 horsepower steam engine was installed at each end of the ferry route, which hauled a cable across the Rhine, connected via a 2.5 metre-long pulley to each pontoon. The wagons ran over a mobile pier on to the pontoon or off it on the other shore. The pontoons ran on a 65 mm-thick rope guide cable over the river. A second cable was used to tow; it was hauled by the pontoon steam engine by means of two pulleys. The Rhenish Railway Company opened a ferry for freight wagons on 23 August 1866 and a ferry for passenger carriages on 1 September 1866. The third and fourth ferry were completed in 1867. Train ferry services were halted for about four weeks by storms, floods and icy conditions each year. Nevertheless, traffic on the train ferry increased from 104,000 wagons and 51 locomotives in 1867 to almost 350,000 wagons and 286 locomotives in the last year of operation in 1873. Coal traffic carried over the Rhine increased from 8 million hundredweight in 1867 to over 28 million hundredweight in 1873. The main problem was the great wear of the ropes, which had to be replaced often. The landing sites sanded up quite quickly and had to be dredged regularly. Train ferry with carriages is in the foreground. Behind is the new railway bridge with a freight train in early January 1874. Behind the bridge are factories in Hochfeld Trajektwagen # 3 End of the train ferry operations The Rhenish Railway Company continually sought to build a bridge over the Rhine and finally succeeded. The construction of the Duisburg- Hochfeld rail bridge was approved on 29 July 1871 and construction started immediately. On 24 December 1873, freight wagons began to run over the bridge, passenger carriages were still carried by the train ferry up to 14 January 1874.

In 1726 he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland, a post he held until 1739. In 1731 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Wyndham, of Finglass in the County of Dublin. He presided as Lord High Steward of Ireland at the trial of Lord Santry for the murder of Laughlin Murphy in 1739; the verdict was guilty and Wyndham had the distinction of being the only Irish judge to sentence an Irish peer to death for murder (although Santry was ultimately reprieved). His conduct of the trial, as was to be expected of a judge with his reputation for integrity, was exemplary, although the prosecution case was so strong that the outcome cannot have been seriously in doubt. Shortly afterwards he was allowed to retire on account of ill health; by his own account, the strain of the Santry trial had taken a great toll on him.Ball, F.

He died in Wiltshire on 24 November 1745, aged 63, and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral. The barony died with him. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin, and received an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin. In 1729 he laid the foundation stone for the new Irish Houses of Parliament. Character Elrington Ball praises him warmly as \\"a great gentleman\\", and one of the most distinguished members of an eminent family.Ball p.101 As a statesman he was prudent and conciliating; as a judge he was noted for efficiency, integrity and impartiality. His devotion to duty, which may have contributed to the collapse of his health, is shown by his willingness to hear urgent cases at home, even during the legal vacation.

A major part of his work includes 10 volumes in a semi-autobiographical novel cycle about the alter-ego figure \\"Eugen Rapp\\". In the 1970s he published the 7-volume Schw√§bische Chronik (\\"Swabian Chronicle\\"). Lenz had been a German POW in U.S. custody during World War II. He received over 15 literary awards. Archives of his writings include some letters exchanged with his fellow writers Paul Celan and Peter Handke and others (see below: \\"Correspondence\\").  Life and work  The front door of Hermann Lenz' later home in K√ºnzelsau. Lenz, son of art teacher Hermann Friedrich Lenz and his wife Elise, grew up until his eleventh year in K√ºnzelsau and then in Stuttgart. After graduation and failed theology studies in T√ºbingen, he began, in 1933, to study Art history, philosophy, Archaeology and Germanic studies in Heidelberg and to study from 1937 in Munich. After early dramatic reading impressions (M√∂rike, Stifter, Schnitzler, Hofmannsthal and others), Lenz first wrote poems and prose pieces. He first appeared in 1936, mediated by Georg von der Vring, with the poetry collection Gedichte, his first publication, which was followed before the war, with the repeatedly revised narrative Das stille Haus (\\"The Silent House\\"). From 1940, Lenz was a soldier in France and Russia, and in 1946 prisoner of war in the United States. Those experiences, that made the student and soldier, influenced his entire literary output. From the start in opposition to Nazism, Lenz moved back into inner worlds - the Biedermeier or the Vienna Fin de si√®cle - the scene of many narrative texts and the object of reflections in countless character monologues. After returning from captivity, Lenz was dedicated, except for secretary work in cultural institutions, just to write. In 1946 he married the art historian Hanne Trautwein, whom he had met in 1937. By 1975, both lived in Stuttgart, at Lenz' home, but inheritance disputes forced a move to Munich, home of his wife. In the midpoint of his work is a - depending on the counting - 10-volume autobiographical novel cycle about the alter-ego figure \\"Eugen Rapp\\", which began with Verlassene Zimmer [The Abandoned Room] (1966) and concluded with Freunde [Friends] (1997). Almost without parallel in the German publications of 1945, this novel explores autobiographical events, and both cuts and captures the political history of Germany in the 20th century. Just as notable are the novels Andere Tage [Other Days] (1968) and Neue Zeit [New Age] (1975), of the daily confrontation with the Third Reich. Lenz comes from an autobiographical concept (\\"Write as you are,\\" is one of the central maxims). It strives to accurately depict life in the details of a metaphysical background to indicate \\"flow into each other past and present\\". In books like Lady and Executioner (1973) and Der Wanderer (1986) Lenz succeeded, again and again, with the autobiographical and merge of the transcendental component of his writing. As the most prominent stylistic device he uses here the form of \\"internal dialogue\\", which makes the character perspective transparent and transferred to the reflections of the outside world directly into sensations. In addition to his novels, and Rapp occasionally published poetry submitted by Lenz, a large number of novels and short stories. These delve, like Die Begegnung [The Encounter] (1979) and Memory of Edward (1981), into the 19th century world, or they design, as in the 1980 completed trilogy Der Innere Bezirk [The Inner District], conscious alternative plans for their own biography. Lenz occasionally followed narrative traditions, especially with The Double Face (1949) or Spiegelh√ºtte (\\"Mirror Cabins\\") (1962), building on forms of magic realism. Hermann Lenz house in Stuttgart. Lenz has been for many years little attention until then but stopped recognition and fame. Peter Handke helped him break through in 1973. Lenz published during 1936-1997 more than 30 books. \\"Ich bin eben ein schw√§bischer Dicksch√§del\\" (\\"I'm just a Swabian mule-head\\"), said Hermann Lenz on his 85th birthday, 26 February 1998, shortly before his death in May of that year. Hermann Lenz had a reading in October 1951 before the Gruppe 47, at the Laufenm√ºhle, a place near Ulm, from an earlier version of the novel Nachmittag einer Dame (\\"Afternoon of a Lady\\"), the first part of Der innere Bezirk (\\"The Inner District\\"). His detached attitude to the group coincides with Paul Celan, who had read a year later in Niendorf. The experience went into the novel Ein Fremdling (\\"A Stranger\\"). Notes in the correspondence of Paul Celan and Hanne and Hermann Lenz, op cit, p.8, p.169 (note 10); from Ein Fremdling [A Stranger], pp. 77-85.  Influences  * In 1993, Lenz established a foundation to support young writers and literary scholars. * After his death in 1998, from the traditional Petrarch Prize a Hermann-Lenz Prize was founded, an annual gathering of friends of literature and poetry from 1999 to 2009, sponsored by Hubert Burda. * Protagonist of his novel work is Eugen Rapp, which he himself described as \\"popular edition of the writer Hermann Lenz\\" and his nine-part Swabian Chronicle with him at the center. As with Eugen Rapp, the other characters in his novels are no \\"heroes\\", but often ordinary people, which are distinguished by their special humanity. So his book is also fascinated by less dramatic actions than by the content and effect of figurative language.  Works = Stories  * Das stille Haus [The Still House] ‚Äì Erz√§hlung. Stuttgart: Dt.

He was responsible for the Golden Era of Ban√≠k Ostrava football club, winning the Czechoslovak First League in 1980 and 1981 with them. He is perceived as the legendary manager of the club.FCB.cz: Ev≈æen Hadamczik by slavil sedmdes√°tiny , 9 November 2009. As a young footballer, Hadamczik got injured in one of the matches, and was forced to end his active career at the age of 22. Because of that, he began his coaching career at very young age. He coached Spartak Doln√≠ Bene≈°ov and Ostroj Opava prior to joining Ban√≠k Ostrava on 1 January 1978. During five years at Ban√≠k, Hadamczik modernized and transformed the team, which became one of the strongest in Czechoslovakia. Under his leadership, Ban√≠k won the Czechoslovak First League in 1980 and 1981 and thrice finished as runner-up. In the 1977/1978 season, the team won the Czechoslovak Cup. In this era Ban√≠k did not lose 74 home matches in a row, thus being almost five years undefeated at their home ground.Bruzl and ≈†i≈ôina 2004, 35. From 1982 to 1984, Hadamczik coached the Czechoslovak Olympic team. However, his long preparations with the Olympic team were wasted, as the communist authorities forbade Czechoslovak sportspeople to compete at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He also led the Czechoslovakia national team on 23 August 1984 in a match against East Germany in Erfurt. Extensive neural load and work stress, as well as his illness, led to his death.Bruzl and ≈†i≈ôina 2004, 59. On 19 September 1984 Ev≈æen Hadamczik hanged himself in his garage in Ostrava. He is buried at the cemetery in his native Krava≈ôe. Each year a memorial football tournament for youth, bearing his name, is played in Ostrava. He was a brother of ice hockey coach Alois Hadamczik.

This was the fifth film in the Olsen Gang- series. For the first time Axel Str√∏bye appeared as kriminalassistent Jensen, pursuing the gang in all later movies. Plot A robbery in a cinema goes awry when the alcoholic brother of Benny, Dynamite-Harry, surprisingly arrives in the middle of the robbery, and Egon ends up in jail yet again, meanwhile the rest of the gang, including Harry, escapes. Egon is released eight months later, but many things have occurred while Egon has been behind bars. Benny and Kjeld have got a permanent job at a local merchant, run by an elderly man named Quist. His daughter Ragna has fallen in love with Benny, to the dismay of her father, who would rather have had an academician. Egon must settle with Dynamite-Harry, as Benny and Kjeld are not interested in the plan Egon has worked out in the prison. The plan is about stealing 6 million kroner - money that cannot be traced. Dynamite-Harry has quit drinking totally after messing up the robbery in the cinema, and he happily helps Egon with a robbery in a merchant. However, it turns out that the merchant they try to rob is the shop where Benny and Kjeld works, and the safe is empty. Benny and Kjeld are doing overtime but are accused of the robbery and imprisoned as Egon and Harry flees before the merchant Quist appears with a rifle, before calling the police. Later, Egon free his friends during a prisoner transport. Now with the gang reunited, they can now go on with Egon's plan. The money are placed in a safe at a warehouse in Christianshavn. The plan is to sneak in through the sewage system, and to continuing up towards the offices where the safe is, secured with light-sensitive alarms and hydraulic doors. However - a few hours before the robbery, Benny and Kjeld are visited by the merchant and Ragna. They want to clear out with their former employees because Ragna still loves Benny. Egon is yet again left on his own, and this time he can't even persuade Harry to join him, especially not if they are going to sail in a boat, which is part of the plan. He decides to complete the robbery on his own, and it goes well until he has to go down a manhole cover in a cold storage, where a guard appears. Having to think quickly, he hides in an unlocked cold room. Meanwhile, Benny and Kjeld have realised how badly the economic situation is in the grocery store, running at a major deficit. The two gang members run away and try to find Egon. They appear in the cold storage's sewer in the exact moment the guard is on his way out. He hears the sound of the manhole cover, turns around and discover that one of the rooms is unlocked. The guards locks the room, with Egon still inside and he is now trapped in a freezingly cold storage room. However, he manages to get Benny and Kjeld's attention by knocking on the door, and they realise that he is locked inside the room, they are unaware however that the room he is trapped within is a cold room. Benny think of Dynamite-Harry, who can blow a hole in the wall on the other side of the cold room, and this time they have to dress up as men transporting beer. They \\"loan\\" an beer van and bring Harry along by forcing him to sit at the back of the van, surrounded by thousands of filled beer bottles. Egon is saved. However, the temptation is too big for Harry at the back of the van, and he is soon in cloud nine, singing Danish psalms in drunkenness. Throughout the movie, the very storage where Egon was trapped has been under severe guard of the police, and after the police successfully storm the warehouse, the police encounters a big problem - the safe. They can't open it, not even with the help of the country's best specialists. The detective instantly thinks of Egon Olsen. Having been escaped, he has brought home to Kjeld and Yvonne, where they have warmed him up. However, the gang panics when the police appears, wanting to speak to Egon Olsen, and they throw the suitcase containing the money into a garbage container, which ends up being brought to a CHP, where the money is blown up. The black powder shown when the money blows up indicates that the money in the suitcase were dirty money. With the help of a cabinet number hidden in his hat, Egon manages to open the safe, and is applauded by the officers, and the detective hands Egon 500 kroner of his own wallet to show his gratitude. However, the detective is shocked to find out that the safe is empty. Egon is driven to the airport by the police, and he manages to get on a plane destined for Mallorca along with the rest of the gang including Yvonne and B√∏rge in the nick of time. Only at this point does he realise what has happened to the money.

By 1856 it had taken its original capacity of 400 patients; growth ensued and by 1900 it housed over 1,000.Hampshire County Lunatic Asylum It was named 'Knowle Mental Hospital' from c.1923 to 1948, when it was renamed 'Knowle Hospital'; it closed in 1996.Hospital Records Database - a Joint Project of the Wellcome Library & the National Archives. The hospital's successor is Ravenswood House, a medium- security mental health hospital which opened in 1985 to care for those afflicted by serious mental illnesses or personality disorders. It can accommodate 77 patients and is complemented by the Southfield Low Security Hospital in the New Forest. Ravenswood is the base of the Wessex Forensic Psychiatric Service. Birth of the village From 2000 onward the former complex of buildings was redeveloped by a group of developers (Berkeley Homes (lead developer), Bovis Homes, Westbury Homes, Try Homes, Barry Jupe and A2Dominion) adding to Knowle Village (village). This comprised 130 apartments (using the former hospital buildings) houses over . The principal northern (east-west) building, northern administration building, south block, superintendent's house, chapel and staff cottages were retained and converted to other uses, whilst the central north‚Äìsouth connecting structure and other periphery buildings were demolished. The redevelopment, coupled with the hamlet which pre-dates, created the first village in Hampshire in over a century, one without a church but with many other amenities. Demolished station Knowle for many decades had Knowle Halt, a halt with platforms, on the Eastleigh to Fareham and Meon Valley lines. The station closed on the 6 April 1964 with the platforms demolished shortly thereafter. Chapel The Chapel Part of the old hospital was a red brick Chapel, with small belfry dressed in stone, built in 1875 to free up space in the main building. As part of the redevelopment of the complex, the chapel was refurbished by Berkeley Homes, at a cost exceeding ¬£400,000. They later transferred ownership of the building to Winchester City Council for ¬£1, with an additional gift of ¬£28,000 to provide some funding for future maintenance costs. The building, which is listed, was leased by the Knowle Communuity Buildings Association (KCBA) for community use. Amenities=Business Park Knowle Village Business Park was gradually built from 2003. Community Hall and cricket club The KCBA vacated the former Chapel for a new build Community Hall adjacent to the cricket pitch, and the chapel was sold in July 2012 for ¬£220,000 by Clive Emson Auctioneers. Memorials=Cemetery Over 5,500 former patients of the asylum are buried in Knowle Cemetery. Before 1886 the location of any specific body was not recorded. Up to four patients could be buried per grave, never on the same day. The last burial at the site took place in 1971. A few remaining iron crosses, generally being the memorials, were removed in 2001 for secure storage pending a decision to relocate them. War Memorial In 1920 a war memorial was erected at Knowle Hospital to honor the 16 staff and estate residents who died during World War I. After World War II, two further names were added to the memorial. Following the closure of the hospital, the memorial was moved from the site due to the redevelopment. With a contribution from the War Memorials Trust, it was relocated to the churchyard of St. Nicholas in Wickham. By 2010, the memorial had been moved back to Knowle and now stands outside the former hospital chapel.

Manaton was the son of Henry Manaton of Trecarrell and his second wife Jane Mapowder, daughter of Narcissus Mapowder of Holsworthy Devon. He was admitted at Gray's Inn in 1671 and called to the bar in 1686. He married Martha Andrew, daughter of Solomon Andrew merchant of Lyme Regis on 3 August 1693. In 1689 Manaton was elected Member of Parliament for Camelford and held the seat until 1695 when he decided not to stand. However he stood for Tavistock after the death of his brother in 1696, but was unsuccessful. He was re-elected at Camelford in 1698 and held the seat until 1703. During this time he was frequently absent from parliament and put into custody for non attendance. In the 1702 election he had stood for Camelford and Tavistock and petitioned against his defeat at Tavistock. As a result, he was seated for Tavistock in 1703 and gave up his seat at Camelford. At the 1708 British general election he was returned as Tory MP for Tavistock, but was defeated at Camelford. He voted against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. At the 1710 British general election, he was returned again as a Tory at Tavistock, but was unseated for flagrant bribery on 3 February 1711. He was elected again for Camelford in a by-election on 26 March 1711 but was unseated on petition on 8 May 1711. He was by this time the recorder of the town. In 1712 he was elected at a by-election as MP for Callington and held the seat until 1713. Manaton was frequently in opposition to war with France. He was usually classed as a Tory, although in his last parliament his unpredictable voting had him classed as \\"whimsical\\". Manaton died before 16 May 1716. He left his estates in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset in trust for his cousin Francis Manaton of Manaton.

The series, spanning 44 episodes, occupied the CCTV-1 prime time slot; after its premiere, there have been many re-runs of the show on television networks in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The series was adapted from Eryue He's historical novels, which are loosely based on historical events in the reigns of the Kangxi and Yongzheng Emperors in the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911). The series was followed by a 2001 prequel, Kangxi Dynasty, and a 2002 sequel, Qianlong Dynasty, both of which were also based on Eryue He's novels. Yongzheng Dynasty was one of the most watched television series in mainland China in the 1990s and remains one of the \\"classics\\" among Chinese historical television dramas. It is among the highest rated CCTV-1 prime time historical dramas in history. The series roughly covers Chinese history from 1705, some 15 years prior to the Yongzheng Emperor's accession to the throne, to the emperor's death in 1735. About one third of the content is devoted to the struggle among the Kangxi Emperor's sons for the succession to their father's throne. Yongzheng Dynasty received critical acclaim. The major themes covered in the series include loyalty and betrayal, fratricide, political corruption, and the centralisation of power. Plot Towards the end of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661‚Äì1722) in the Qing dynasty, the emperor's talented and ambitious sons vie for the coveted throne. Palace intrigue is rife as complex networks of loyalty emerge in the battle for succession. Eventually, the Fourth Prince, Yinzhen, emerges victorious; he becomes known as the Yongzheng Emperor. Many people are surprised as to why the Kangxi Emperor chose Yinzhen over his other likely heirs: Second Prince Yinreng, who has been Crown Prince for almost 40 years; Third Prince Yinzhi, who excels in literary arts; Eighth Prince Yinsi, who has a reputation for being virtuous; 14th Prince Yinti, the warrior-prince favoured by his father. Yinzhen, who is nicknamed \\"Stern Prince\\", was not seen as a strong candidate by the imperial court to succeed his father. Previously, he had incited victims of natural disasters in Jiangnan to create a disturbance; to help these victims, he prepared a \\"Feast at Hong Gate\\" to extort more than two million silver taels from rich merchants and provincial officials; in pursuing imperial treasury debts, he forced a senior official to commit suicide and caused nobles to sell their assets on the streets; he watched his brothers compete with each other until they were exhausted before he joined the fray; he used Nian Gengyao to cause Yinreng to lose his position as Crown Prince in a corruption scandal, however, superficially, he maintained good relations with Yinreng. In the ensuing struggle after Yinreng is removed for a second time as Crown Prince, the Kangxi Emperor scolds Yinsi for vying for the throne, and orders Yinxiang to be imprisoned. The Kangxi Emperor then appoints Yinti as border pacification general-in-chief. As the ailing Kangxi Emperor lays on his deathbed, he assembles seven of his sons to his deathbed, including Yinsi and Yinzhen. Prior to their father's death, Yinzhen releases Yinxiang from captivity and sends him to take control of Fengtai Commandery on the outskirts of Beijing. The Kangxi Emperor speaks to Yinzhen in private, telling him he intends to pass on the throne to him, then dies. Longkodo reads the Kangxi Emperor's final edict and declares Yinzhen the new Emperor. The Yongzheng Emperor's rule was seen as authoritarian and vigorous, but efficient. Upon ascending the throne, he made Yinsi and Yinxiang his top advisors. His first priority was to pursue debts owed to the state treasury by officials. He meted out harsh punishments to officials found guilty of corruption and bribery. He also used the confiscated assets and properties from corrupt officials to finance disaster relief efforts and his military campaigns in northwestern China. He grows distant to some of his most trusted advisers, including Nian Gengyao and Longkodo. Both Nian and Longkodo eventually fall out of the emperor's favour. The emperor's 13th brother Yinxiang dies while his eighth brother Yinsi and ninth brother Yintang are expelled from the imperial clan and become commoners. In 1735, the hardworking Yongzheng Emperor dies suddenly from what appears to be over-exhaustion. He is succeeded by his son, Hongli, who becomes known as the Qianlong Emperor. Before Hongli becomes the emperor, the Yongzheng Emperor forces another of his sons, Hongshi, to commit suicide so as to prevent Hongshi from fighting with Hongli for the throne.

The series showed Yinsi as much more \\"in control\\" of the situation than he actually was. Historically, the Yongzheng Emperor scapegoated Yinsi more than the other way around. Furthermore, Yinsi had fallen out of favour with the Yongzheng Emperor by the second year of the emperor's reign (1724), and died in captivity two years later, but in the series he was portrayed to have died shortly before the Yongzheng Emperor. *Historically, Yinsi did not propose an \\"Eight Princes Regency\\", nor did he propose to force the hand of the Yongzheng Emperor through controlling the military in the capital. He also did not liaise with iron-cap princes for the purpose of deposing the Yongzheng Emperor. All the \\"iron-cap\\" princes involved in the 'palace coup' episode are fictional, as their names do not appear in historical records. *The series made repeated references to Yinsi being created a qinwang (first-rank prince) by the Kangxi Emperor, when, in reality, he was only a beile until the Yongzheng Emperor came to the throne. Historically, the Yongzheng Emperor made Yinsi a qinwang on the day after his coronation. ;Other princes *Yintang was sent to the northwest ostensibly to aid military activity on the frontiers shortly after Yinzhen's accession; in the series this move is portrayed as a means to check Nian Gengyao, but in reality the purpose of this trip was to distance Yintang from potential conspiracies with Yinsi. *Empress Xiaogongren, the mother of the Yongzheng Emperor and Yinti, died in June 1723, due to sudden illness, less than six months after her son became emperor. In the series it appears in the middle of the Yongzheng Emperor's reign. *Hongshi died at age 23 in 1727, likely due to being forced to commit suicide, though historians do not uniformly agree on the cause of his death. 1727 was the fifth year of the Yongzheng era, meaning that Prince Bao (Hongli) was heir presumptive for most of the Yongzheng era. In the series, Hongshi was shown to have died nearing the end of the Yongzheng era after having plotted to kill Hongli, none of which was backed by any historical evidence. ;Officials *Historically, Li Wei was never Governor of Jiangsu, nor Viceroy of Liangjiang, as he was portrayed in the series. He served Governor of Zhejiang, then Viceroy of Zhili in the later years of the Yongzheng era. However, historically, one of Li Wei's major achievements was the implementation of the replacement of the head tax with a land tax. *Wu Sidao was on the staff of Tian Wenjing and was never known to have liaised privately with Yinzhen. In the series, Wu Sidao was portrayed as a major mastermind during Yinzhen's struggle for the throne, serving Yinzhen directly. *While Zhang Tinglu did serve historically as a head administrator of the imperial examinations, he was not executed for conspiring to leak the contents of the exam. In fact, he served with distinction until the early years of the Qianlong era. *Neither the official historical record, which was likely doctored in the Yongzheng Emperor's favour, nor any unofficial histories, stipulate Zhang Tingyu as being present during the delivery of the will of the late emperor. Apart from this detail, the series mostly stayed true to the official histories of the Qing dynasty. A rough consensus among historians was that the \\"seven princes receiving the will\\" version of events was concocted by Yinzhen and his supporters after the silencing of his political rivals. More likely, the only significant figures tending to the Kangxi Emperor in his final days were Longkodo and Yinzhen himself. ;Personal *In the series, the Yongzheng Emperor is shown to have died due to exhaustion from overwork. Most historians agree that the cause of death was more likely his overdosing on what he thought to be an elixir for eternal life. His death also occurred rather suddenly; that is, he was not suffering from any known chronic illness. Historians believe that the emperor had become obsessed searching for such an elixir both before and after his ascension to the throne. *Qiao Yindi, depicted as a lover of both Yinti and the Yongzheng Emperor, is an entirely fictional character Soundtrack The music for the series was composed by Xu Peidong. # De Minxin Zhe De Tianxia (ÂæóÊ∞ëÂøÉËÄÖÂæóÂ§©‰∏ã; The One Who Wins the Hearts of the People Gains the Empire) performed by Liu Huan # Mutong (ÁâßÁ´•; Shepherd Boy) performed by Xu Peidong # Shengong (Ê∑±ÂÆ´; Inner Palace) # Qingzhai (ÊÉÖÂÄ∫; Emotional Debt) # Shangchao (‰∏äÊúù; Attending Court) # Chuzheng (Âá∫ÂæÅ; Embarking on a Military Campaign) # Qingyuan (ÊÉÖÁºò; Predestined Romance) # Shijian (‰∫ã‰ª∂; Incident) # Shenmi (Á•ûÁßò; Mysterious) # Qingshang (ÊÉÖÊÆá; Dead Romance) # Minsu (Ê∞ë‰øó; Popular Custom) # Qingyuan (ÊÉÖÊÄ®; Emotional Blame) # Xingdong (Ë°åÂä®; Action) # Kaixuan (ÂáØÊóã; Triumphant Return) # Shiguan (Âè≤ËßÇ; Historical Perspective) Awards and nominations * 17th Golden Eagle Television Awards (1999) ** Outstanding Drama ** Outstanding Lead Actor (Tang Guoqiang) ** Outstanding Supporting Actor (Jiao Huang, Wang Huichun) ** Best Screenplay ** Best Art Direction ** Best Editing ** Best Music ** Best Theme Song * 19th Flying Sky Television Awards (1999) ** Best Drama ** Best Actor (Jiao Huang) ** Best Screenplay ** Best Art Direction ** Best Music ReferencesExternal links * Category:1999 Chinese television series debuts Category:Television series set in the Qing dynasty Category:Mandarin-language television shows Category:Television shows based on Chinese novels Category:Chinese historical television series Category:Television series set in the 18th century ","title":"Yongzheng Dynasty"},{"id":"29229701","text":"The √âcole nationale d'ing√©nieurs de Brest (ENIB) is a French grande √©cole leading to the French ‚ÄúDipl√¥me d‚ÄôIng√©nieur‚Äù under the authority of the French Ministry of Education and Research.

It is a clone of the arcade game Sinistar. Gameplay BBC Micro screenshot The player uses four keys, two to rotate the ship (which is always moving forwards), one for fire and one to launch a starbomb. Firing can destroy both enemy workers and warriors, but only a starbomb can be used against the eponymous Deathstar itself. Collisions with workers, warriors or asteroids (referred to in the instructions as planetoids) do not harm the player. The job of the workers is to build the Deathstar by transporting crystals to it, whilst the job of the warriors is to mine the crystals and also defend the Deathstar by attacking the player. The initial objective is to keep on firing at the asteroids until they start to shed crystals, which are then picked up in order to score points, but more importantly the crystals are converted into starbombs. The starbombs are ultimately used against the Deathstar, once the workers have finished constructing it. The player must successfully defeat the Deathstar to progress into the Worker Zone which has very few planetoids, with a bonus screen between each zone. The game employs 16-way scrolling over a multi-coloured starfield and runs at a fast rate on both the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron hardware. Despite the inferior hardware of the Acorn Electron, the in-game sound can be improved up to BBC Micro standards with the addition of Project Expansions' Sound Cartridge. Development Title screen of the unreleased Atarisoft version, before the game was renamed to Deathstar (BBC Micro) Originally, the game was to be published by Atarisoft as an official port of the arcade version under its original name, Sinistar. However, the Atarisoft brand was dropped in 1984 and Atari decided to pull out of the Acorn computer market altogether whilst a number of games were still under development. The game was instead renamed Deathstar and a new title screen designed, allowing it to be released as an unofficial clone by Superior Software in 1985. The game was released shortly after another popular game Repton and is regarded as being part of a successful run of titles from Superior Software in a short space of time. The then-renamed Deathstar was first published solely by Superior Software in 1985 and later re-released in 1989 by Superior Software and Blue Ribbon as a budget title. The game also appeared on the Beau Jolly compilations Five Star Games and 10 Computer Hits 4, and Superior Software's own Superior Collection compilations (vol 2 on the BBC, vol 3 on the Electron). A cheat loader program for the game was also published in 1988 by Impact Software on the compilation Cheat it again Joe 1. An in-built cheat was discovered to have been left in the BBC version of the game and was published in the March 1989 edition of Micro User magazine. Deathstar was prominently advertised with full-page dedicated ads in various Acorn-related publications of the 1980s and was also reviewed in magazines such as Acorn User and Electron User. In the 21st century, Deathstar was again reviewed in the 2009 book The 8-Bit Book - 1981 to 199x by Jerry Ellis, published by Hiive books. A similar title Mega Apocalypse also for the BBC Micro, was due to be released by Martech Games Ltd, but was ultimately abandoned half-finished in 1988. Speech chip support The Sinistar arcade game uses sampled speech, which is beyond the abilities of standard BBC Micro and Electron hardware. The BBC Micro has a speech synthesiser chip available as an official add-on, but it has a limited vocabulary. Users who played with this hardware would hear the speech chip say \\"R, R, R, I an complete\\" (using the letter \\"R\\" repeated for the laugh, and \\"an\\" instead of \\"am\\"), though this is not a line from the arcade original. Programmer Peter Johnson said at the time \\"I knew very few gamers would have that speech chip fitted, but I would have loved to see the expression of surprise on their faces the first time they heard the DeathStar speak.\\" Reception Roland Waddliove, writing in Electron User magazine stated that \\"DEATHSTAR is a super fast, all-action arcade classic\\", \\"it's the sort of game that you can't put down\\" and \\"you've got to have just one more go\\". Martin Reed also in Electron User described the game as \\"an excellent conversion\\" and \\"a great blast\\". The Electron User Group describe the game as \\"furiously fast\\", \\"supremely playable\\" and as having \\"a large playing window\\", whilst the Monkey's Brain website describes the game as \\"another top-quality arcade conversion\\". Oliver Robinson on the bbcmicrogames.com website describes the game as \\"almost arcade perfect\\" and as \\"an example of how well the BBC could replicate fast paced, action arcade games\\". Game programmer Jason Sobell stated that he \\"liked Peter Johnson's DeathStar\\", pointing out the similarity to the game Asteroids. The game was given a BJ score of 92% on the Five Star Games compilation, although this rating was awarded by Beau Jolly themselves, the publisher of the compilation and therefore can not be considered to originate from a neutral source. Since the end of the BBC Micro commercial era, some players using emulation have expressed a preference for playing the Acorn Electron version over the BBC Micro version, because it uses keys 'Z' and 'X' to rotate the spacecraft rather than 'CAPS LOCK' and 'left-CTRL' which are vertically aligned on many modern-day keyboards.

His portrait to the right, shows him pointing to an early pyrometer from Pieter van Musschenbroeck with pumps in the background. In 1769, Steven Hoogendijk co-founded the Batavian Society for Experimental Philosophy, with a main aim of introducing the steam engine in the Netherlands, and with the motto: \\"Certos Feret experientia fructus\\" (experience will give reliable products). With the support of the Society at their own expense they brought a Newcomen steam engine from England to an old Powder Tower at the edge of Rotterdam. On 9 March 1776, the machine was first put into operation. The steam engine components worked well, but the self- designed wooden Hoogendijk pumps were not compatible and quickly collapsed. This made it such an impression that in 1787 a new steam engine was built in the Polder Zoo. The expected theoretical capacity of 1750 cubic feet per minute displacement was only 5% higher than the observed effective capacity. Nevertheless general acceptance in the Netherlands of the steam engine was slow due to allegiance to the existing mill methods. International Steven Hoogendijk Prizes The triennial International Steven Hoogendijk Prize for medical engineering was first awarded in 2001, shared by three individuals, Professors Nicolas Bom, Jan Somer, both from the Netherlands and Prof. David Sahn of Portland, Oregon. The subject was pediatric echocardiography. The second award in 2004 was given to Prof. Thomas Sinkjaer from Aalborg, Denmark, recognizing his work on functional electro-stimulation to recover lost neuromuscular functions of the human body. The third award in 2007 was for Prof. Willi Kalender, from Erlangen, Germany, inventor of the spiral CT scanner. In 2010, the award went to George M. Church, of Harvard Medical School, for \\"minimal invasive diagnosis\\" (genome sequencing technology). The award in 2010 was presented by Rotterdam mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb after introductory comments by Prof. H.W.

Basso profondo voice range (C2‚ÄìC4) indicated on piano keyboard in green with dot marking middle C While The New Grove Dictionary of Opera defines a typical bass as having a range that is limited to the second E below middle C (E2),; The Oxford Dictionary of Music gives E2 to E4 or F4 operatic bassi profondi can be called on to sing low C (C2), such as in the role of Baron Ochs in Der Rosenkavalier. Often choral composers make use of lower notes, such as G1 or even F1; in such rare cases the choir relies on exceptionally deep-ranged bassi profondi termed oktavists or octavists, who sometimes sing an octave below the bass part.  Definition Range of a basso profondo according to the Italian definition ranging from C to F According to the Italian definition, any singer with an E in fortissimo is a basso profondo. Italian composers considered basso profondo basses with \\"large\\" voices with a range of E to E, lower than typical basses. Although a basso profondo obviously requires the ability to sing notes in a lower register, more importance is placed on the quality of \\"largeness\\", or resonance and sonority. According to Rousseau (1775): \\"Basse-contres ‚Äì the most profound of all voices, singing lower than the bass like a double bass, and should not be confused with contrabasses, which are instruments.\\" Russian composer Pavel Chesnokov divides the bass section into these groups: # baritones # light basses # strong basses # strong basses with a good low register # oktavists with medium range, power and a soft sound # strong and deep oktavists Groups 5 and 6 are considered bassi profondi. Oktavist An oktavist is an exceptionally deep-ranged basso profondo, especially typical of Russian Orthodox choral music. This voice type has a vocal range which extends down to A (an octave below the baritone range) and sometimes to F (an octave below the bass staff) with the extreme lows for oktavists, such as Mikhail Zlatopolsky or Alexander Ort, reaching C. Slavic choral composers sometimes make use of lower notes such as B1 as in Rachmaninoff's All-Night Vigil, G in \\"Ne otverzhi mene\\" by Pavel Chesnokov, or F1 in \\"Kheruvimskaya pesn\\" (Song of Cherubim) by Krzysztof Penderecki, although such notes sometimes also appear in repertoire by non-Slavic composers (e.g. B appears in Gustav Mahler's Second and Eighth Symphonies). Russian composers often make no distinction between a basso profondo and an oktavist, or a contrabass singer. Because the human voice usually takes a long time to develop and grow, low notes often sound more resonant and full as the singer has aged considerably; thus oktavists are often older men. Sergei Kochetov, Vladimir Miller, and Mikhail Kruglov recorded a number of classic Russian folk songs and similar music, singing them in a low-pitched key to invoke the old oktavist tradition which dates back to the Tsar's court.

The single was released physically only in Japan, containing 3 songs. There was also a digital single version available worldwide, which contained only the title song \\"Are You Metal?\\", entirely composed by vocalist Andi Deris. Music video On 11 October the music video was released on Myspace. Visually, it draws heavily from the Saw movies. During the keyboard intro, the band's iconic \\"Helloween Pumpkin\\" can be seen as a human doing the \\"Devil Horns\\" sign. The video features the band playing in a trashed and abandoned house. Its storyline is about three women who are trapped in the same house. They all have big metal headphones on their ears, and when they take them off, it appears that they are subjected to a painfully loud sound. However, in order to reach the key to get out (the key is seven knives put together - the same that is on the album cover of 7 Sinners) they must take off the headphones in order to fit through a small hole in the wall. The first two women do not succeed in doing this, and have to put their headphones back on. However, the third woman takes off her headphones, and when she hears the sound, she begins to headbang (It is then implied that the sound is the band's heavy metal music, or possibly just heavy metal music in general). She is able to reach the key and they are able to escape. For the second half of the video, scenes of the band playing in front of a crowd are featured, which includes snippets of Dr. Stein. Track listing=Single (physically released only in Japan) Notes: # Only track 1 \\"Are You Metal?\\" is available on the digital single version. # The single version of \\"Raise the Noise\\" is shorter than the original album version and features a guitar solo instead of the flute solo version on the album.

End≈ç is among the few living people who studied directly under aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba.Stanley Pranin, Interview with Seishiro Endo Aikido Journal #106 (1996) He trained at Aikikai Hombu Dojo with master teachers including Seigo Yamaguchi, Hiroshi Tada, Mitsunari Kanai, and Yasuo Kobayashi. When Endo was 30 years old he dislocated his right shoulder. According to an interview, that event brought him to a turning point. After the injury, Yamaguchi said to him, \\"You‚Äôve been doing aikido for 10 years now, but now you have only your left arm to use, what are you going to do?\\" This prompted Endo to pursue a different direction in his Aikido. His Aikido eventually became a lot softer and more contact-based. Teaching methodology Endo teaches mostly principles on how to connect to your partner and how to move freely. There is less focus on learning a large number of techniques. He also emphasizes that each student must confirm his feeling during each part of an exercise or technique. He talks about concentration of ki, relaxation of the upper body, flexible movement and calmness of the mind at all times. He also encourages his students to be investigative and not to accept things that are taught without confirming it for themselves. :I began to ceaselessly examine and confirm my state of mind: myself when it went well, myself when it went poorly, myself when I was trying to defeat my partner, myself when I was feeling fear, myself when I was feeling insecure, etc. From these confirmations, I learned the importance of ceaselessly keeping my mind calm.Seishiro Endo, Aikid√¥ and Self-Inquiry Saku Dojo In 1993, he created the Aikido Saku Dojo in his hometown of Saku, Nagano, Japan.Aikid√¥ Saku D√¥j√¥'s newsletter \\"Cosmos\\" Instructional DVDs After opening his own dojo, Endo started to document his Aikido through a series of instructional DVDs under the name of WayMastery Store.Way Mastery Store Some of the videos are covering certain basic principles, while others are exploring how to deal with a particular attack.

Salmaniya Medical Complex () is a public hospital situated in the Salmaniya district of Manama in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Established in 1957 and having a bed capacity of approximately 1,200 beds, it is the largest tertiary hospital in the country. The hospital provides secondary, tertiary, and emergency healthcare services as well as specialised outpatient clinics for the general public. Residency programs in the hospital are either Arab Board or Saudi Board certified. The hospital receives an average of 900-1000 patients a day and employs more than 2,000 physicians, nurses and workers. Bahrain's main morgue is situated in the complex. Salmaniya's emergency department receives more than 300,000 patients per year. The emergency department follows the Manchester Triage System and is Arab Board certified, amongst other residency programs. History Dedication plaque of Salmaniya Medical Complex Healthcare in Bahrain during the first half of the 20th century was predominantly supplied by the private American Mission Hospital, the small government hospital at Noaim (currently Noaim health centre) and Awali hospital. To cope with a largely increasing population, Salmaniya Medical Complex was opened in 1957 with a total capacity of 50 beds. The hospital underwent numerous expansions throughout its history; in 1977, the Emir of Bahrain Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa opened the first major expansion of the complex, which consisted of several new buildings which increased the hospital's total capacity to 470 beds. Further expansion in 1987 increased the total bed count to 617 beds. In 1997, a large expansion of Salmaniya was opened and included 20 new wards, which increased the total bed count to 926 beds. In 2014, a 90-bed unit dedicated to hereditary blood disorders including Sickle Cell Disease was established.  Role in the Bahraini uprising  The entrance to the Accident and Emergency department. Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw sustained pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. At Salmaniya Medical Complex, doctors joined the protests themselves, speaking to protesters and media from the hospital stairs, after authorities blocked ambulances from bringing injured protesters there for care. The military responded by naming the hospital an opposition stronghold, taking it over and occupying it with masked personnel on 16 March. Military personnel used hospital records to find patients who had been active in the protests, identifying them in many cases by wounds from the birdshot fired by security forces into crowds. According to Human Rights Watch, these patients were then segregated, interrogated, and in many cases, beaten in their hospital beds by masked security agents. 17 February raid at Pearl Roundabout. In March and April 2011, twenty health workers, primarily from Salminya, were arrested on a variety of felony charges for their actions during the protests, while an additional twenty-eight were arrested for misdemeanors. Dr. Ali Al-Ekri was arrested while performing surgery at Salmaniya Medical Complex. Charges against the doctors included \\"occupying a hospital, stockpiling weapons, spreading lies and false news, inciting hatred of Bahrain's rulers and calling for their overthrow, and withholding treatment of Sunnis\\". The government additionally alleged that blood from hospital blood banks had been used to exaggerate wounds, that health workers had transported weapons to the protesters by ambulance, and that AK-47s had been confiscated inside the hospital on a police raid. State media described the defendants as having \\"a terrorist aim\\". According to the prosecutor's case, al-Ekri had acted as the group's ringleader, organizing staff at Salmaniya to oppose the Bahraini government. The defendants denied all charges and maintained that the accusations were politically motivated. In a joint statement, they held that \\"our only crime was that during the unrest earlier this year, we were outspoken witnesses to the bloodshed and the brutal treatment by the security forces.\\" In September 2011, twenty of the health workers were convicted by a military court on felonies including \\"stockpiling weapons\\" and \\"plotting to overthrow the government\\". The remaining twenty-eight were charged with misdemeanors and tried separately. The following month, the sentences were overturned, and it was announced that the defendants would be retried by a civilian court. Retrials began in March 2012, but were postponed until June 14. The case has drawn international attention, with organizations including the U.S. State Department, the United Nations, the World Medical Association, the British Medical Association, Doctors Without Borders, the International Council of Nurses, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Freedom House expressing their concern over the health workers' military trials and sentences. An independent commission organized by the king of Bahrain concluded in November 2011 that many of the detained health workers had been subject to torture and abuse while in police detention.

He was the second U.S. Army aviation fatality, preceded by Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge who was killed while flying as an observer in a Wright Flyer piloted by Orville Wright on 17 September 1908. Biography Kelly was born on 11 December 1878 in London, England, and educated at Bedford Modern School.Kelly's obituary appeared a little belatedly in The Eagle (the magazine of Bedford Modern School), vol. 13, no. 8 (July, 1918), pp. 168-9 He emigrated, gained U.S. citizenship, and joined the U.S. Army in 1904. On January 16, 1911 Kelly was a troop officer in the 30th Infantry when he participated in an exhibition reconnaissance flight with Wright Company pilot Walter Brookins. Kelly volunteered for flying training and was detailed to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps and sent to the Curtiss aviation school in San Diego, California. Before his training was completed, he and two other pilots (1st Lt. Paul W. Beck and 2nd Lt. John C. Walker, Jr.) were sent to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, where the Maneuver Division had been activated in March. 1st Lt. Benjamin Foulois, then the Army's sole aviator, was also stationed at \\"Fort Sam\\" with its sole operational aircraft, a leased Wright Model B. There the Army accepted delivery of two new aircraft, a Curtiss Model D, serial number S.C. No. 2, and a Wright Model B, S.C. No. 3, on April 27, 1911, and resumed training for the three prospective pilots. On 10 May 1911, Kelly took S.C. No. 2 up alone for his pilot qualification flight. The airplane had nearly crashed a week before with Walker at the controls, and Beck had then damaged it in a test flight following. After five minutes in the air, Kelly came down for a landing at what appeared be full speed and failed to level off in time. The front wheel of the airplane struck the ground, breaking the fork of the steering wheel. Heading for the tent encampment of the infantry, Kelly managed to pull up and turn to make another landing attempt. This time the airplane went out of control and crashed, pitching Kelly 100 feet out of the aircraft. The investigating board ruled that the crash occurred because the first landing had damaged the control system, and that Kelly sacrificed himself to avoid plowing into the encampment. He died from a skull fracture at Fort Sam Houston Hospital an hour after the accident. He was buried in San Antonio National Cemetery. Foulois felt that the accident was the fault of Beck (who had in the meantime been promoted to captain and now commanded the small unit, to the annoyance of the more experienced Foulois) for the use of faulty materials to rebuild the plane after Beck's accident the preceding week. The plane's Curtiss mechanic, however, blamed Kelly's poor flying technique, stating that when he banked the plane to turn away from the infantry camp, the wing struck the ground. Due to this crash, the commanding officer of the Maneuver Division, Maj. Gen. William Harding Carter, banned further training flights at the fort. The flying section, now led by Capt. Beck and including the repaired S.C. No. 2, was shipped to College Park, Maryland in June‚ÄìJuly 1911 where the Army opened its own Flying School in June.Baker, David, \\"Flight and Flying: A Chronology\\", Facts On File, Inc., New York, 1994, Library of Congress card number 92-31491, , page 49.

His single first-class cricket appearance was as a member of what was, according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, \\"a very weak Somerset team\\" in the match against Cambridge University at Cambridge in May 1921. Somerset were beaten by an innings within two days, but Woodcock's own contribution was not insubstantial. In the first innings, he made only five, but his medium pace bowling took four of the seven Cambridge wickets to fall. Then, when Somerset fell to 84 for eight wickets in the second innings, requiring 301 to make Cambridge bat again and with Cuthbert Fairbanks-Smith unable to bat, Woodcock and Edward Baker, a pre-First World War Cambridge cricketer also playing his only match for Somerset, put on 128 for the ninth (and last) wicket, each of them making 63.

Mankovitz also graduated from the University of LaVerne College of Law with a Juris Doctor degree, was a member of the California and Federal Bar, and a licensed patent attorney. Engineering career Mankovitz joined Rocketdyne, then a division of North American Aviation, to design electrical control systems for rockets. He designed and developed engine control systems for Gemini and Apollo spacecraft and the Lunar Descent engine, developed digital solenoid valve drivers that enabled the control of large valves with a minimum of electrical power. A few years later, Mankovitz joined the Guidance and Control Division at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he authored computer programs and designed control systems for Mars landing vehicles and deep space probes. He advanced to become the division representative to the Advance Technical Studies Group and authored several NASA publications in the field. He also served as a consultant to the U.S. Air Force in the evaluation of Soviet spacecraft design. When he began his career in the field of rocket science, the traditional approach to modeling the behavior of spacecraft was to use analog computers as the tool of choice. He chose to replace the analog computer by emulating its behavior on a digital computer, and then proceeding from there.

His entry into the commercial world of electronics was based on a bold statement he made to the president of the company that he could develop a relay that had no moving parts, and hence not wear out. Mankovitz was hired to do just that, and the result was the formation of a new industry that produced solid state relays and circuit breakers to replace the old versions in critical applications. He guided the development of the product line to a multimillion-dollar division, with Teledyne becoming a leader in the field of solid state relays. Mankovitz was awarded several patents in the field.Solid State Relay Patents U.S. Patent 3,648,075 U.S. Patent 3,691,426 Entrepreneurship Mankovitz co-founded Chardonnay Corporation, which designed and produced remote-controlled systems that automated the operation of spas and swimming pools. It revolutionized the industry by completely automating the operation of pool-spa combinations. In 1991, Mankovitz joined a start-up company, Gemstar Development Corporation as its in-house intellectual property counsel, as well as a member of its research and development team. During his tenure, he became a director and officer, and built Gemstar into a patent powerhouse in the field of consumer electronics. One of their first projects was VCR Plus, built into virtually every VCR to simplify the recording process by replacing the old one, which was too complicated. Along the way, he assisted in developing the on-screen television guide,Example On Screen Television Guide Patent widely available from most cable companies, to replace the print guide provided in newspapers.

The character made his television debut in \\"The Curse of Tut\\" (April 13, 1966). He was created by Earl Barret, Robert C. Dennis and Charles R. Rondeau, and portrayed by Victor Buono. In his memoir Back to the Batcave, Adam West describes him as the only villain created for the TV series to be a real success. Publication history The character of King Tut started out on the Batman television line episodes of the series' original run.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0120658/filmoseries#tt0059968 Fictional character biography=Batman King Tut began as Professor William Omaha McElroy (portrayed by Victor Buono), an Egyptologist at Yale University. After a blow to the head during a student riot, the Professor developed amnesia and thereafter believed he was a reincarnation of King Tut. He sought to take over Gotham City and defeat Batman and Robin. He was defeated by another blow to the head, returning him to his normal state. The pattern would follow for subsequent appearances‚Äîhe would suffer a blow to the head, believe himself to be King Tut, fight Batman and Robin for control of Gotham City, only to suffer another blow to the head, which would return him to his real self. As such, he would be the only villain not to be jailed for his actions (the insanity defense would apply here). Completely cognizant of what happens during his states of amnesia, Professor McElroy tried to prevent the personality switching by wearing a reinforced hat to prevent unwanted blows, but without success. King Tut attempted to release a handful of ancient scarab beetles on Gotham City in the second season of the series. With the beetles in his possession, Tut would have the ability to create a terrible ancient potion called abu raubu simbu tu, which can be used to subdue the human will. Tut planned on concocting 95,000 gallons of the drug, more than enough to put all of Gotham under his power. His first victim was the head of the Gotham City Police, Chief O'Hara, who Tut commanded to perform acrobatics on the ledge of a building. King Tut nearly succeeded in his sinister plot, having tricked Batman into taking the drug as well. However, Batman protected himself from the drug's hypnotic power by coating his stomach with buttermilk. While trying to escape, Tut accidentally swallowed the drug himself and became Batman's slave, which allowed Batman and Robin to safely take King Tut to Commissioner Gordon's office where he reverted to his normal self. In the episodes \\"King Tut's Coup\\" and \\"Batman's Waterloo\\", Professor McElroy is approached by two Yale students who ask him about his King Tut side. He tells them about it while he mentions that he had to wear a reinforced hat to prevent unwanted blows. The moment he shows off his hat, two flower pots hit the students on the head and then one hits McElroy as well. The students develop the personalities of King Tut's Royal Jester and Lord Chancellor, respectively, and Professor McElroy becomes King Tut again. Together with a female moll named Neila, they plotted to capture Lisa Carson. With help from Neila, Batman and Robin were able to get King Tut hit on the head again regressing him back to Professor McElroy. In \\"The Unkindliest Tut of All\\", it was mentioned by Commissioner Gordon to Batman that Professor McElroy was hit on the head by a brick while at a love-in. King Tut sets himself up as a crime predictor and even claims that Bruce Wayne is Batman. While claiming that there will be a raid on Gotham State Penitentiary to free all of its arch-criminals, King Tut targets a scroll that will take him to the statue of a god. With help from Batgirl, Batman and Robin defeat King Tut and his henchmen. While at the Gotham City Police Department, King Tut still claims that Batman is Bruce Wayne when Commissioner Gordon gets a call from a beat cop stating that Louie the Lilac was sighted. In \\"I'll Be a Mummy's Uncle\\", King Tut gets out of his therapy lesson and buys a plot of land adjacent to Wayne Manor as part of a plan to obtain a rare mineral. The villain tunnels beneath the manor and accidentally discovers the Batcave. He realizes that Batman and Bruce Wayne are the same person. Batman and Robin then battle Tut and his henchmen in the Batcave. The Dynamic Duo administer a drug spray to the henchmen that erases their recent memory. Tut, however, flees to the surface via the tunnel after all the spray runs out from the can. Once at the top of the tunnel, Tut is about to reveal his discovery of the Batcave‚Äîand Batman's true identity of Bruce Wayne‚Äîto Commissioner Gordon, when Batman provokes Tut to raise his voice, thereby causing a rock to fall on his head, knocking him out. When Tut regains consciousness, he is once again Professor McElroy, with no memories of Batman's secret identity. Seeing that he is late for his class, Professor McElroy runs off with Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara still asking who Batman is as they go after him. King Tut later pops up in \\"The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra\\" (with Guy Way portraying King Tut). He alongside Joker, Riddler, Penguin, Catwoman, and Egghead are freed from Gotham State Penitentiary by Dr. Cassandra Spellcraft and Cabala. When explaining her plans to rule Gotham City, she gives King Tut the job to rob the museums. The villains are defeated by Batman, Robin, and Batgirl. Tut's hideouts sometimes include an apothecary, the only one in Gotham, in the Pyramid building. DC Universe A depiction of King Tut made his DC Comics Universe debut in Batman Confidential No. 26, (April 2009). This version was created by Christina Weir, Nunzio DeFilippis, and Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez. His alter-ego is an homage to actor Victor Buono. The comic book version of King Tut is Victor Goodman, a criminal Egyptologist who targets and murders wealthy citizens and leaves Egyptian-themed riddles, similar to the Riddle of the Sphinx. Batman teams up with the Riddler, who does not appreciate his modus operandi being stolen and agrees to help to stop Goodman. They manage to defeat King Tut, who is sent to prison until he is transferred to Arkham Asylum.Batman Confidential #26‚Äì28, (April‚ÄìJune 2009). DC Comics. The character appears once again in the \\"DC Rebirth\\" in The Riddler: Year of the Villain as a friend of Edward Nygma. He is first shown talking to Nygma in an Egyptian-themed restaurant and Nygma tells him that he is angry and jealous that he has not received a visit from Lex Luthor (who has been visiting various villains across the DC Universe as part of a nefarious plan he is setting up). But after stating this, he eventually gets visited by Luthor anyway. King Tut then appears later on telling him that they should team up to outsmart Batman by working together and he initially agrees. After Batman goes through a complicated Egyptian puzzle set up by Tut, Riddler decides to quit and leaves, thinking about the advice Luthor gave him. Batman then knocks out Tut with a single punch.The Riddler: Year of the Villain #1 (September 2019). DC Comics. In other media * A character similar to King Tut appears on Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by John DiMaggio. Due to copyright issues with Fox, the character is referred to in the synopsis as Pharaoh. In \\"Day of the Dark Knight!\\", he is shown as a convict trying to escape Iron Heights Penitentiary but is foiled by Batman and Green Arrow. The other convicts that Pharaoh escapes with are either common criminals, the show's supervillains, or other villains from the Adam West series (including Egghead, The Bookworm, Archer, Louie the Lilac, and Shame, who are recognized both by facial features and their trademark hats). Pharaoh makes another jailbreak cameo at Blackgate Penitentiary in \\"Night of the Huntress!\\". In \\"Battle of the Superheroes!\\", Batman and Robin wear special mummified suits to fight Pharaoh when he uses a special staff to turn people into zombies that obey his every command. The wrappings are coated in buttermilk, another reference to the live-action Batman series. With some pictures taken by Vicki Vale, Batman and Robin manage to defeat Pharaoh and free his victims. * King Tut appears in Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders. He is among the villains that Robin and Catwoman recruit to help fight an evilized Batman after the two of them spring King Tut and the villains from Gotham State Penitentiary. * King Tut appears in The Lego Batman Movie. He is among the villains that assist Joker in his attacks on Gotham City. * King Tut appears in Batman vs. Two-Face, voiced by Wally Wingert. He and his henchmen steal a biplane and attacked an Egyptian-themed event that Aunt Harriet and Alfred Pennyworth are attending. While the civilians escape, the heroes are subdued by Tut's goons. They escape a deathtrap using Batjets in their shoes and capture Tut and his men, but their loot is secretly taken by Two-Face's henchmen. Batman, Robin, Commissioner Gordon, and Chief O'Hara interrogate McElroy as Harvey waits in the shadows, with O'Hara constantly hitting the professor on the head with his baton to switch his personality, with Tut's stubborn attitude causing himself to bring back McElroy. McElroy's lawyer Lucilee Diamond intervenes and ushers them out of the room so that she can speak to him. At Professor McElroy's trial, she implicates that the concussion is nothing more than a threat to a mild-mannered man. Chief O'Hara tearfully confesses to hitting McElroy and Harvey calls Batman as his next witness, but Professor McElroy himself admits his guilt, ready to suffer the minimum penalty of being rehabilitated in prison.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms respond to heat shock or other environmental stress by inducing the synthesis of proteins collectively known as heat-shock proteins (hsp). Amongst them is a family of proteins with an average molecular weight of 20 kDa, known as the hsp20 proteins. These seem to act as protein chaperones that can protect other proteins against heat-induced denaturation and aggregation. Hsp20 proteins seem to form large heterooligomeric aggregates. Structurally, this family is characterised by the presence of a conserved C-terminal domain, alpha-crystallin domain, of about 100 residues. Recently, small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) were found in marine viruses (cyanophages).  Function and regulation  Hsp20, like all heat shock proteins, is in abundance when cells are under stressed conditions. Hsp20 is known to be expressed in many human tissues, including the brain and heart. Hsp20 has been studied extensively in cardiac myocytes and is known to act as a chaperon protein, binding to protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and allowing its nuclear transport. In addition, the phosphorylation of hsp20 has been shown to effect the structure of cells cytoskeletons. Due to hsp20 commonly forming dimers with itself when heated, its function of chaperoning can be greatly affected.

The continuous green functions \\\\scriptstyle \\\\scriptstyle\\\\sin^n(x) converge to the non-continuous red function. This can happen only if convergence is not uniform. In mathematics, the uniform limit theorem states that the uniform limit of any sequence of continuous functions is continuous. Statement More precisely, let X be a topological space, let Y be a metric space, and let ∆ín : X -> Y be a sequence of functions converging uniformly to a function ∆í : X -> Y. According to the uniform limit theorem, if each of the functions ∆ín is continuous, then the limit ∆í must be continuous as well. This theorem does not hold if uniform convergence is replaced by pointwise convergence. For example, let ∆ín : [0, 1] -> R be the sequence of functions ∆ín(x) = xn. Then each function ∆ín is continuous, but the sequence converges pointwise to the discontinuous function ∆í that is zero on [0, 1) but has ∆í(1) = 1\\\\. Another example is shown in the adjacent image. In terms of function spaces, the uniform limit theorem says that the space C(X, Y) of all continuous functions from a topological space X to a metric space Y is a closed subset of YX under the uniform metric. In the case where Y is complete, it follows that C(X, Y) is itself a complete metric space. In particular, if Y is a Banach space, then C(X, Y) is itself a Banach space under the uniform norm. The uniform limit theorem also holds if continuity is replaced by uniform continuity. That is, if X and Y are metric spaces and ∆ín : X -> Y is a sequence of uniformly continuous functions converging uniformly to a function ∆í, then ∆í must be uniformly continuous. Proof In order to prove the continuity of f, we have to show that for every Œµ > 0, there exists a neighbourhood U of any point x of X such that: :d_Y(f(x),f(y)) < \\\\epsilon, \\\\qquad\\\\forall y \\\\in U Consider an arbitrary Œµ > 0. Since the sequence of functions {fn} converges uniformly to f by hypothesis, there exists a natural number N such that: :d_Y(f_N(t),f(t)) < \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{3}, \\\\qquad\\\\forall t \\\\in X Moreover, since fN is continuous on X by hypothesis, for every x there exists a neighbourhood U such that: :d_Y(f_N(x),f_N(y)) < \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{3}, \\\\qquad\\\\forall y \\\\in U In the final step, we apply the triangle inequality in the following way: :\\\\begin{align} d_Y(f(x),f(y)) & \\\\leq d_Y(f(x),f_N(x)) + d_Y(f_N(x),f_N(y)) + d_Y(f_N(y),f(y)) \\\\ & < \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{3} + \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{3} + \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{3} = \\\\epsilon, \\\\qquad \\\\forall y \\\\in U \\\\end{align} Hence, we have shown that the first inequality in the proof holds, so by definition f is continuous everywhere on X.

It represents on the obverse the head of Juno Sospita, and the reverse refers to the worship of that goddess at Lanuvium.Eckhel, vol. V p. 292, &c.; Lucius Roscius Fabatus (c. 95‚Äì90 BC ‚Äì 43 BC) was a military officer and politician of the late Roman Republic. Belonging to the plebeian gens Roscii, he was probably born around 95‚Äì90 BC in Lanuvium, a town in Latium known for its temple and cult of Juno Sospita. He began his political career (cursus honorum) as a moneyer in 64 BC.So dated by Michael Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, Vol. 1, p. 439‚Äì440, no. 412. Dated by older works to 58 BC. In 55 BC he was elected tribune of the plebs and co-sponsored at least one law, the lex Mamilia Roscia Alliena Peducaea Fabia. Associated with the faction of the populares, he supported Julius Caesar. He was a member of Caesar's staff in the Gallic Wars and was charged with various tasks, including commanding the Thirteenth Legion on the Lower Rhine, in the winter of 54 BC. It was during this winter that Ambiorix induced the Eburones and Nervii to attack in detail the quarters of the Roman legions, but in the operations resulting from their revolt Fabatus seems to have taken no part, since the district in which he was stationed remained quiet.Caesar, De Bello Gallico v. 24. He informed Caesar, however, about hostile movements in Armorica in the same winter.Ibid, 53. After his service in Gaul, he supported Caesar in the Senate. Elected praetor in 49 BC, he sought to mediate between Caesar and his opponents in Caesar's Civil War. In 49 BC, he promulgated a law bearing his name, which gave full Roman citizenship to the populations of Cisalpine Gaul in Transpadania (the area north of the River Po). Gardner, J. F., The Dictator, in Griffin, M., A Companion to Julius Caesar (2009), p. 65 After Caesar crossed the Rubicon, Pompey sent Fabatus with Lucius Caesar and other senators from Rome to meet Caesar at Ariminum, with proposals of accommodation both public and private. Caesar charged Fabatus with counter-proposals, which he delivered to Pompey and the consuls at Capua.Cicero ad Ait. viii. 12; Caesar, De Bello Civili i.8, 10; Cassius Dio xli.5. Caesar's opponents were willing to accept Caesar's proposals with substantial amendments, which Fabatus and L. Caesar reported to Caesar. Caesar rejected these amendments and Fabatus's missions did not prevent the escalation of the civil war. After the assassination of Caesar, Fabatus took part in the ensuing civil wars. He was killed on April 14 or 15th, 43 BC, in the Battle of Forum Gallorum between Mark Antony and the legions of the senate.Cicero ad Fam. x. 33.

The film was based on the 1957 novel of the same name by Brian Moore (written under the pen-name Michael Bryan). It was shot on location in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with an international cast of European and North American actors. Plot Having previously survived an assassination attempt, Juan Menda (Lom), president of an unspecified South American country, is moved to Montreal under an anonymous pseudonym for treatment of a potentially fatal cranial blood clot. His political opponents have got wind of his whereabouts and hire a trio of Canadian hitmen to finish the job. Menda's aide Francisco (Carlo Giustini) is also in town, and unknown to Menda he is actually a prime-mover in the assassination plot, keeping close to Menda while duplicitously passing on information to the would-be killers. Not only is Francisco an unsuspected political arch-rival, but he is also keeping an eye on Menda's glamorous wife Carla (Lisa Gastoni), with whom he fancies his chances once Menda is out of the way. Meanwhile, British surgeon Bob McLaurin (Todd) is under pressure from nagging, dissatisfied wife Margaret (Catherine Boyle), who wants him to give up his job in Canada and move back to London to open a private cosmetic surgery for the wealthy, where he could at least double his income. Margaret claims to know of an (imaginary) affair of Bob with fellow surgeon Nancy Ferguson (Drake), and is threatening to go public with the information. The worry causes Bob to lose concentration during Menda's operation, and he almost makes a fatal slip-up. However, in the end the operation is a complete success. As Menda recovers, he grows uneasy about Carla's apparent lack of interest as she makes no effort to visit. He also starts to suspect that there is more to Francisco than meets the eye. Eventually he comes to the conclusion that the two of them are in league in some way or another, at best to dally romantically behind his back, at worst to be working with his enemies to plot his demise. Fearing for his safety, he demands to be moved to a different hospital room. The hitmen make their move on what they believe to be Menda's room, only to find they have killed a completely innocent man in the hospital for surgery on a slipped disc. Bob, Nancy and the police all believe the unfortunate dead man was mistaken for Menda, and a policeman is detailed to provide Menda with a 24-hour guard until he is ready to return home. The hitmen, determined not to lose their payoff, end up acting rashly and their carelessness leads to a confrontation in the hospital corridors, shooting it out with the police while Bob is caught up in the middle. The hitmen start to turn on each other. The wounded Bob tackles one, and during a struggle the two crash out of a window and fall to the ground. The unconscious assassin is arrested. As confusion and chaos rages in the hospital, one of the hitmen manages to slip away and takes the opportunity to enter Menda's temporarily unguarded room to perform a quick hit. He discovers that Menda is far more ready for him than he could have anticipated.

Hardres was the son of Sir Thomas Hardres, 3rd Baronet and his wife Ursua Rooke, daughter of Sir William Rooke of Horton, Kent. He inherited the baronetcy on the death of his father on 23 February 1688. He was described as a person of great and ready wit, and in comfortable circumstances as 'a single gentleman with a ¬£1,000 p.a. estate', and was seen as a man of great potential. Hardres was returned unopposed as Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Kent at a by-election on 13 June 1711. In February 1712 he was involved in preparing a bill to facilitate the completion of a chapel of ease at Deal. At the 1713 British general election, he was returned instead as MP for Dover. He was consulted on matters relating to Dover and the Cinque Ports and in March 1714, he and his fellow MP wrote a joint letter to Dover about presenting a petition for a bill to protect the port's fishing grounds. He retired at the 1715 British general election. Out of Parliament ha remained active as a Justice of the Peace. At the 1722 British general election, he stood for parliament at Canterbury but was defeated. He was returned as MP for Canterbury at the 1727 British general election. He voted against the Government on the Hessians in 1730, which was his only recorded vote. He was returned again at the 1734 British general election but a petition was presented against him and he retired on 11 April 1735, possibly also because of gout. Hardres married Eliza Disher, widow of William Disher and daughter of Richard Thomas of Lamberhurst under a licence dated 26 March 1712.

Its importance strengthened further after the Royal Air Force moved to the district in 1927. They constructed airports and some military camps to accommodate the Air Force soldiers. After World War II Khormaksar was planned and built according to the modern English-style with all the necessary facilities. Further more, the Military Airport was renovated and a new airport was constructed which is known today as Aden International Airport. This was followed by the construction of several wooden houses, some of which consists of two floors and some other one-story English style houses and constructed Elizabeth II Hospital which was hospital in Aden. At the end of the 1950s Al-Shabat (from English \\"the shops\\") area was constructed in the district. It consisted of a number of large apartment buildings, new streets were paved and all supporting facilities such as schools, public colleges, public parks, casinos and discoth√®ques, cinemas and hotels were built.

It was constructed between 1843 and 1848 by the architect Louis Visconti, who also designed the tomb of Napoleon. The four figures on the fountain represent four French religious figures of the 17th century famous for their eloquence. * Bossuet, North, statue by Jean-Jacques Feuch√®re * F√©nelon, East, statue by Fran√ßois Lanno * Fl√©chier, West, statue by Louis Desprez * Massillon, South, statue by Jacques-Auguste Fauginet, completed by Fouquiet after the death of Fauginet. The fountain is also called, in French, \\"La Fontaine des quatre points cardinaux,\\" which means the \\"Fountain of the 4 Cardinal Directions,\\" as it faces North, South, East, and West. This name is also a pun, because \\"points cardinaux\\" in French is a play on words. It can be understood as \\"Point Cardinaux\\" which means \\"not Cardinals,\\" as all four of the bishops portrayed in the statues, while renown, were never elevated to a Cardinal.

Rambuteau took office in 1833 and began an ambitious program to improve the city water supply and build new fountains. He built 200 kilometers of new water mains and, more important, 1700 small fountains around Paris to supply water, so that monumental fountains could be purely decorative, and did not have to provide drinking water.B√©atrice Lamoitier, L'essor des fontaines monumentales, in Paris et ses fontaines de la Renaissance √† nos jours, pg. 171. The most important monumental fountains he constructed were the Fontaines de la Concorde in the Place de la Concorde (1840); the fountains of the Champs-√âlys√©es (1839‚Äì40); the Fontaine Moli√®re (1841‚Äì44); the Fontaine Cuvier (1840‚Äì46) and the Fontaine Saint-Sulpice. Rambuteau ordered that the theme of the fountain would be religious eloquence, since the fountain was placed in front of a church and near an important seminary. Visconti prepared several different projects in March 1843 to the Conseil des batiments civil. After some modifications, the project was approved and construction took place between 1843 and 1848, and was completed in the year when the Revolution of 1848 brought down the government of Louis-Philippe. The final fountain had two distinct parts; the fountain itself, composed of three octagonal basins. The second basin was decorated with sculptures of lions made of stone from Derre, which had the coat of arms of Paris; and the third had pots which spouted water. The second part of the fountain was the religious structure; a quatrilateral edifice with a dome, corinthian pilasters, and four niches which contained the statues of the orators. The fountain was criticized when it opened; first, because it hid the entrance of the church; second, because of the incoherence of the iconography and details; one critic noted that the vases pouring water were \\"veritable cooking pots.\\" Describing the lions, another critic wrote that \\"everything about them shows their irritation at the water pouring onto their rear ends.\\".C√©sar Daly, Revue g√©n√©rale de l'architecture et des travaux publics. 1845, t.

The name was proposed by Edmund Stump, leader of a U.S. Antarctic Research Program (USARP) - Arizona State University geological party which made investigations here in the 1980-81 season. The mountains are composed of granites which have weathered to produce a series of spires and peaks reminiscent of a Gothic cathedral.  Key mountains  * Altar Peak () is a peak (1,780 m) located 1 nautical mile (1.9 km) east- southeast of Mount Harkness. The feature was first visited in December 1934 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Quin Blackburn. The descriptive name was suggested by Edmund Stump, leader of a United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP)-Arizona State University geological party which studied this peak, 1987-88. * Grizzly Peak () is a peak rising to 2,200 m on the southwest flank of Mount Zanuck. The feature was visited in December 1934 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party and was included in \\"Darryl Zanuck Mountain.\\" The granite of this peak is highly jointed and fairly bristles with small spires, suggestive of the coat of a grizzly bear. *Mount Zanuck () is a mountain about long surmounted by three sharp peaks in an east-west line, the highest of which rises to . The feature stands at the south side of Albanus Glacier at the point where the latter joins Scott Glacier. Discovered by Byrd on the Byrd Antarctic Expedition flight to the South Pole in November 1929. The mountain was visited in December 1934 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Quin Blackburn. Named by Byrd for Darryl F. Zanuck, official of Twentieth Century-Fox Pictures, who assisted the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 1933‚Äì35, in assembling motion-picture records, and later supplied the United States Antarctic Service (USAS), 1939‚Äì41, with motion-picture projectors. * Zanuck East Peak () is the easternmost of the three high peaks that rise from Mount Zanuck massif. The peak was discovered and mapped by the geological party of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 1933‚Äì35, led by Quin Blackburn. The name was applied in association with Mount Zanuck by members of New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE) who climbed the peak in the 1969-70 season.

The name THIRRA was derived from its project title Portable System for TeleHealth and Health Informatics for Rural and Remote Areas.  History  The THIRRA project was one of the pioneer eHealth telemedicine projects under the PANACeA network, funded by the International Development Research Centre. It was conceptualised in February 2007, with partners from Primary Care Doctors Organisation Malaysia (PCDOM), Sri Lanka Health Telematics, Healthnet Nepal and ICCDR,B of Bangladesh.  Features of THIRRA  The main component of THIRRA is the Electronic Health Records System. Besides the EHR, it also has the Biosurveillance mode, that enables Public Health Departments to monitor and investigate infectious diseases outbreaks. THIRRA can be used in an offline mobile mode, where no reliance on the Internet is required. Data is stored on the mobile devices such as laptops and netbooks. The users can synchronise the data with the main server when they return to the clinic/hospital. THIRRA was written in the PHP programming language, using the CodeIgniter framework. The application is based on the Hierarchical Model View Controller (HMVC) design pattern, using the Modular Extension extension. This makes THIRRA modular by nature. It stores data in the PostgreSQL database system and uses the JQuery UI Javascript framework for its Web 2.0 functionalities. THIRRA is also integrated with another open source software called Generic Engine for Modules to expand its modules. Modules can be created by the health care professionals without requiring any programming knowledge. It provides ICD-10 classification for diagnosis and LOINC for coding of labs and imaging orders.

As of 2019, MassChallenge has accelerated more than 1,900 startups that have raised more than $4.3 billion in funding and generated $2.5 billion in revenue. MassChallenge is headquartered in Boston's Seaport District in the Innovation and Design Building. History MassChallenge co-founders John Harthorne and Akhil Nigam were working as strategy consultants at Bain & Company during the global financial crisis in 2008. It was at this time that John and Akhil developed the concept for MassChallenge, a not-for-profit startup competition that would help jumpstart the global economy by supporting entrepreneurs around the world. MassChallenge secured early support from successful entrepreneurs like Desh Deshpande and Joe Fallon, the public sector including Thomas Menino the then-Mayor of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and large organizations like The Blackstone Charitable Foundation and Microsoft. During its first Boston-based cohort in 2010, MassChallenge accelerated 111 startups. In 2018, MassChallenge accelerated 449 startups from 54 countries across its eight accelerators worldwide. MassChallenge accepts less than 10% of all applicants. Structure MassChallenge runs one accelerator program in each of its locations and in each of its verticals each year. MassChallenge does not take equity from its startups, and in turn, provides $3M in non-dilutive cash prizes globally to the top startups at the end of the program.  Accelerators  In MassChallenge's accelerators (Boston, Israel, Mexico, Switzerland, Texas), selected startups are early-stage (<$1M in funding) and participate in a four-month, industry-agnostic program where they receive mentorship, entrepreneurship and industry training, free co-working space, and the opportunity to win non-dilutive cash prizes.  Vertical Programs  In MassChallenge's vertical accelerators (HealthTech and FinTech), selected startups are later stage (<$10M in funding) and participate in a six month long program where they partner with a top business, institution, or organization to solve key challenges related to their industry.  Corporate Partnerships  As a not-for-profit, MassChallenge is primarily supported by corporate partnerships. Top partners include The Boston Foundation, Buhler, CASIS, Facebook, General Electric, MassMutual, Microsoft, Nestle, Southwest Airlines, and Vertex. In June 2019, MassMutual announced that it would donate an entire floor of its new $240 million office building at 10 Fan Pier Boulevard in the Boston Seaport district to MassChallenge for five years rent- free starting in 2021 when the building opens.

The company operated bus and coach services in Surrey, West Sussex, Hampshire and Berkshire from 1924 until 2001. It was founded as Tillingbourne Valley in 1924, and became a limited company in 1931, taking the name Tillingbourne Valley Services. It initially operated routes in the Guildford area from a garage in Chilworth using small single-deck buses painted in a maroon livery. Coach hire and excursions began in 1931, but two years later these activities split into a separate company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently for a further 24 years. Until 1970 Tillingbourne was owned and managed by three generations of the Trice family, before being sold to Trevor Brown. The company changed its name to Tillingbourne Bus Company in 1972, changing its livery to blue and yellow, and moved to a garage in Gomshall in the same year. A second garage in Ewhurst was opened in 1974. An expansion of operations in the late 1970s and early 1980s, much of it through the award of county council contracted routes, took the company's vehicles into West Sussex and Hampshire as well as Surrey. Tillingbourne took over the services of London operator Orpington & District following that company's collapse in 1981. These were run separately from the main company as Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) which, in 1983, was sold to its management to form Metrobus, now part of the Go-Ahead Group. The company moved garages again in 1980, settling in Cranleigh. A new, larger garage in the same town was opened in February 2001. Deregulation of local bus services in 1986 led to further expansion, including the establishment in 1989 of a new brand, Hobbit, for Tillingbourne's minibus operations. A high-quality coaching subsidiary, Dorking Coaches, was also operated towards the end of Tillingbourne's life. Tillingbourne began operations with a single vehicle, expanding to operate around 70 buses by 2001. A range of types were operated, including early Thornycroft and Dennis vehicles, and later Guy and Bedford products. The company's fleet was updated in the 1990s with new Volvo and Optare vehicles. Following Tillingbourne's closure, its fleet was disposed of, with vehicles sold to Shamrock Coaches, Norfolk Green, Black Prince Buses, Safeguard Coaches, Arriva Guildford & West Surrey and Islwyn Borough Transport. The company was placed in administration in March 2001, following two years of heavy losses, and closed down permanently a month later.Cranleigh bus company calls in receivers Surrey Advertiser 23 March 2001 This led to a series of service changes, which saw its operations covered by a range of different operators. Other effects causing Tillingbourne's collapse included a fall in the total number of passengers using buses in Hampshire and local criticism following an increase in the number of vehicles using the, later closed, Arriva West Sussex garage in Warnham. The sites of both Tillingbourne garages in Cranleigh were converted for use by other industries. History=Creation and early history (1924-1972) Tillingbourne was formed in 1924 by Vic Smith and George Trice. It was initially known as Tillingbourne Valley, and operated a single vehicle in a maroon livery from a garage in Chilworth on a service between Guildford and Gomshall. Smith left the company in the late 1920s, and a new route from Guildford to Albury Park was introduced around the same time, with four vehicles owned by 1928. The route to Gomshall was extended to Peaslake, and briefly faced competition from Surrey Hills Motor Services prior to their takeover by Aldershot & District, who withdrew the competing route. The company's garage was rebuilt after being destroyed in a fire along with three of its vehicles in 1928. Tillingbourne was reconstituted as a limited company, Tillingbourne Valley Services Limited, in October 1931. Following George Trice's death in 1933, control of the business passed to his son, also called George. A coach hire and excursion business had been introduced in July 1931; this was split out into a new company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently until 1955. From the early 1930s, until 1964, the service to Peaslake was run jointly with the London Passenger Transport Board; operation of the entire route was taken over in August 1964, but falling passenger numbers meant that the route was cut back in frequency a year later. A new livery of maroon and grey was introduced in 1964.Burnett; James (1990) pp.24-35 George Trice retired in 1948 and was succeeded by his son Derek, who sold Tillingbourne to Trevor Brown in September 1970. In the same year, route numbering was introduced for the first time to the three routes then operated. The company made an operating loss in 1969 and 1970, so one route, a local service in Guildford, was withdrawn in October 1971 due to poor usage, and another was cut in frequency. As the Chilworth garage was still owned by Trice, operations were transferred to an open-air site in Gomshall in early 1972.Burnett; James (1990) pp.39-45 Change of name and expansion (1972-1986) The company's name was changed to Tillingbourne Bus Company in May 1972, following the introduction of a service between Horsham and Colgate, with a new livery of blue, yellow and grey introduced. A new Managing Director, Barry King, joined Tillingbourne from North Downs Coaches in the same year. In 1974, a small garage in Ewhurst was acquired and maintenance work transferred there, although the majority of the fleet continued to be based in Gomshall.Burnett; James (1990) pp.47-60 In May 1976, the company's long-established route between Guildford and Peaslake was extended to Cranleigh via Ewhurst, and a once-daily schoolday service to and from The Haven, the first bus route to serve the community, was introduced. A number of service changes saw Tillingbourne vehicles operating to Croydon and Chichester one day a week each by 1977, although both were withdrawn after three years. The service to Colgate was withdrawn and replaced by a local half-hourly route in Horsham in 1979. In September 1980, the company moved depots again to a larger site in Cranleigh.Burnett; James (1990) pp.64-75 The collapse of Orpington & District in early 1981 prompted the company to launch a new operation in Greater London. This was split from the main operation as Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) in July 1981, but sold to its managerial team in 1983.Tillingbourne Commercial Motor 1 October 1983 It adopted the name Metrobus and continues to operate. In June 1981, new once-weekly routes linking Horsham to Steyning and Cranleigh/Ewhurst to Brighton were introduced, the second to replace a withdrawn Southdown Motor Services service.Burnett; James (1990), pp.80-99 To improve profits on the Brighton route, beer was carried from the Sussex Brewery near Edburton to public houses along the route alongside passengers.Hops on the new service Commercial Motor 6 June 1981 The scheduled service operations of coach firm McCann's were acquired, together with three vehicles, on 1 November 1982, although some were withdrawn a year later. Further expansion came in April 1985, following over a year of consultation with county council members, regulators, when two new routes were introduced. One operated in competition with Alder Valley, while the other took the place of services withdrawn by other operators.Competition in Surrey Commercial Motor 20 April 1985 Following these changes Tillingbourne became the only operator to serve Chilworth, Albury and Shere. Two new vehicles were purchased for the routes. At the same time, all of Tillingbourne's services were renumbered into a new two-digit sequence, to avoid confusion with London Country routes. A year later, the second of the new services, circular route 23/25, was reduced in frequency from hourly to two-hourly, although much of the route was covered by extending another route. Another new service, linking Cranleigh and Godalming, was also introduced. In August 1986, operation of a number of council-contracted services, including a route from Redhill to Reigate and a local route in Horsham, were taken over from other companies.Burnett; James (1990), pp.111-119 Post-deregulation (1986-2001) Optare Prisma bodied Mercedes-Benz O405 in Horsham in May 1999 Following deregulation in October 1986, a small number of service changes were made, with a new route from Guildford to Chiddingfold being introduced and a service to Gomshall withdrawn. At the same time, a new brand name, Hobbit, was introduced for Tillingbourne's minibus operations. Barry King left the company in December 1986 and was replaced as Managing Director by Chris Bowler.Burnett; James (1990), pp.123-125 In early 1989, operations in Horsham were reduced, following the loss of the tendered route to Barns Green. A new service to Billingshurst was briefly introduced in February 1989, but withdrawn after two months. In July, a new service between Guildford and the British Aerospace site at Dunsfold Aerodrome was introduced. Further expansion eastwards came in November 1989, when the operation of eleven tendered routes, requiring six buses, was won from the county council. These were operated under the Hobbit name.Burnett; James (1990), pp.130-135 A new service linking Normandy and Christmaspie to Guildford two days a week was introduced in October 1989. A second route to the two villages was added in 1995. In January 1999 a new route from Farnham to Tongham via Normandy was launched, as was a direct service from the village to Guildford. In 1998 an outstation was opened in Aldershot following the award of contracted work in Reading to Tillingbourne. Tillingbourne introduced a new tourist route in the summer of 1995. Operating on Sundays for six months of the year, it provided a circular service linking Guildford, Godalming and Cranleigh with a number of nearby rural locations not served by other routes. Although similar services were operated by London & Country and Nostalgiabus, the new service was designed to avoid any direct competition. The route was operated with a Bristol SU single- decker acquired from a bus preservationist. In September 2000, Tillingbourne controversially reduced the number of journeys on contracted route 516, which linked Dorking, Leatherhead and Epsom. Although this was within the terms of the contract, it was criticised by residents of intermediate villages, who claimed the communities relied in particular on a cancelled morning journey. Operations were moved to a new larger site, still located in Cranleigh, in February 2001. The company believed this would reduce operating costs and allow for future expansion. Closure Tillingbourne's name on the side of Guildford bus station in October 2008 On 19 March 2001, Tillingbourne abruptly ceased operations and was placed in the hands of receivers Begbies Traynor. This followed two years in which the company had lost around ¬£450,000. The receivers blamed the losses on increasing costs, low subsidies from local councils and falling passenger numbers. The closure left 140 staff unemployed and caused large numbers of passengers to be stranded. Replacement services were organised by Surrey County Council and four bus operators, with the majority of routes being covered within days by temporary contracted services. Some schoolchildren were forced to find other means of transport, although workings on routes 62 and 63 were covered by Aventa Transport. It was initially thought that Tillingbourne would be sold to another operator, with four companies reported to be interested. However, by early April 2001, it became clear that this would not take place, as the offers submitted were lower than the value of the vehicles owned by the company. Begbies Traynor was criticised by Council members for refusing to keep the company operational while replacement services were being arranged. Mole Valley councillor Hazel Watson stated that the withdrawal of services at short notice was \\"totally unacceptable\\", while Shere county councillor David Davis described the closure as a \\"local tragedy\\". Council leaders also denied the claim that the subsidies had been too low. Related operations ;Tillingbourne Valley Coaches In 1933, the bus and coach operations of what was then Tillingbourne Valley Services were split. The coaching unit was taken over by Lionel Rhees, previously an employee of Tillingbourne, and operated from a depot in Chilworth under the name Tillingbourne Valley Coaches. This company bought three second-hand coaches to run on excursions and private hire operations. After 14 years of operation it launched a bus service between Guildford and Blackheath. Rhees died in 1953 and Tillingbourne Valley Coaches passed to his wife, who sold out to established operator Rackliffe of Guildford a year later. Rackliffe was itself taken over by Cookes Coaches in 1955, and the Blackheath service withdrawn. ;Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited In February 1981, the long-standing operator Orpington & District collapsed due to financial difficulties, so Tillingbourne decided to launch a test operation of three former O&D; services. These proved successful, so more services were added and two new AEC Reliance coaches purchased for the operation. In July 1981, the Orpington operation was given a separate licence, under the name Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited, with six vehicles allocated to it. By 1983, however, it became clear that the local area management of Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) wanted to develop the business in a different way from that of the main company. On 24 September 1983, the Orpington operation's directors, Gary Wood and Peter Larking, bought out the subsidiary to form Metrobus Limited.Burnett; James (1990) pp.97-99 ;Dorking Coaches Following the takeover of Dorking Coaches in the late 1990s, a coaching division was set up using the same name, under the management of former Traffic ManagerBurnett; James (1990) p.127 John Gaff. It operated high-quality coaches, including three air- conditioned vehicles which joined the fleet in 2000, on coach hire and tour work. Fleet One of a pair of Optare Excels new to Tillingbourne operating with Safeguard Coaches following Tillingbourne's collapse The first vehicle to be bought by Tillingbourne was a single-deck Chevrolet with 14 seats, which entered service on the launch of the company's first route in 1924. It was joined by a similar Overland Automobile bus later in the year. Two further vehicles had been purchased by 1928, when a depot fire destroyed three of the four buses. They were replaced by second-hand buses including an 18-seat Dennis and several Thornycroft A2 vehicles. From November 1934 until the outbreak of World War II, these were progressively replaced by new buses, also built by Thornycroft.Burnett; James (1990) pp.14-26 The first double-deck vehicle to be bought was a Bristol K Type, which joined the fleet in 1959. Eight Guy Vixens were bought from London Transport between 1963 and 1964 to replace the entire previous fleet. These were succeeded by a wide variety of types, with Bedford coaches and buses the most numerous.Burnett; James (1990) pp.36-49 In the 1970s, a number of second-hand Bristol SUL4A's, with ECW B36F bodies, were operated. In the period shortly before and after deregulation, a range of types were used. As well as a large number of Bedford vehicles, which continued to be bought new until the late 1980s, the fleet also included the AEC Reliance, Leyland Leopard, Leyland Tiger and Volvo B10M models, and the first two Dennis Lancet single-deckers to be built.Burnett; James (1990), pp.61-75 The company bought its first minibus, a 16-seat Ford Transit, in 1985.Burnett; James (1990), p.113 The Tillingbourne fleet in the late 1980s and early 1990s also included two rare Dennis Dorchesters bought new, and a Volvo B10M coach with the last Plaxton Derwent body built.Brown (1995), p.165 The fleet was substantially updated shortly prior to the company's closure. Two Volvo B6 single-deckers were bought in 1994. These were followed by a number of Optare products including the Metrorider minibus and four of the last Optare Vecta single-deckers built. The most common type in the fleet in the late 1990s was the Mercedes-Benz 811D minibus; by 1998 21 were in use out of a total fleet of 65. Tillingbourne bought its first low-floor buses, two new Optare Excels, in 2000. Legacy and subsequent history One of the two Dennis Darts owned by Surrey County Council that were leased to Tillingbourne in service with Arriva Guildford & West Surrey Tillingbourne's routes were taken over by a variety of local operators. Arriva Guildford & West Surrey took over the majority of the operations in Guildford and Cranleigh, while the Arriva West Sussex division took over services in Horsham. Operations in and around Woking were taken on by Tellings-Golden Miller and Reptons Coaches. White Rose took over the route between Staines and Camberley, while Thames Travel took over the routes into Reading. Following the end of Tillingbourne's operations, many of its newer vehicles were sold for further use. Buyers included Black Prince Buses, which took three Optare Prismas, and Islwyn Borough Transport, which bought Tillingbourne's Optare Vectas. One of the surviving Leyland Tigers was bought by Norfolk Green. The biggest customer was Shamrock Coaches of Pontypridd which took 27 vehicles, including the Mercedes minibuses and nine Optare Metroriders. Some vehicles remained in Surrey, including two Dennis Dart SLFs leased from Surrey County Council which were passed on to Arriva Guildford & West Surrey, and two Optare Excels bought by Safeguard Coaches of Guildford. A fall in bus passenger numbers, between 1999 and 2001 in the areas of Hampshire served by Tillingbourne, was in part explained as being a result of the loss of services caused by the company's closure. The increased vehicle requirements at Arriva's Warnham (Horsham) garage, which took over three of Tillingbourne's former routes, led to criticism from residents in the area and the suggestion that the site should be closed and operations moved to another location. The depot, buses and operation were sold by Arriva to Metrobus in September 2009, who moved all operations to their garage in Crawley and closed the site. Both of Tillingbourne's former garage sites in Cranleigh have been converted for other uses. Permission was granted in February 2002 for the smaller site abandoned shortly before the company closed down to be taken over by a plant and vehicle hire firm. The larger site used in the final few months of operation was converted for use by a mail order firm, with permission for the change granted by the local council in November 2002.

In the story, a youth's adventure is externalized in a search for a letter, which results in a discovery of their own persona. Synopsis In the night before his accolade and ascension to knighthood, which is traditionally spent as a nocturnal vigil in a small chapel, 16-year-old squire Tiuri, son of a famous knight in the realm of Dagonaut, receives a desperate plea for help from a stranger knocking at the chapel door. Unable to refuse a call for help, he breaks the tradition and goes outside, where the stranger, an old man, hands him a sealed letter and begs him to deliver it to a knight clad in black armor and a white shield residing in a nearby forest inn. Tiuri agrees to deliver it, but upon arriving at the inn, he learns to his dismay that the knight he seeks has in the meantime been challenged by another black knight, this one with a red shield. Tracing the path the knights have taken into the forest, Tiuri finds the knight with the white shield dying, mortally wounded in a cowardly ambush. When the knight learns of Tiuri's possession of the letter, he charges him with delivering it to the neighbouring realm of the west, ruled by the wise King Unauwen, and to seek out a hermit named Menaures living in the mountains separating the two kingdoms, who would show him a secret way through the mountains. Bound by his sense of honor, Tiuri accepts the task and the ring the knight gives him in order to stress the importance of his mission, and remains with the knight until he dies. Soon, however, Tiuri finds himself hunted by riders clad in red, the henchmen of the knight with the red shield, and is forced to flee for his life. In order to speed his progress, he claims the steed of the knight with the white shield, a formidable night-black destrier who accepts him as his new rider. He also finds himself chased by a quartet of knights in grey, who are eager to kill him for unknown reasons, and temporarily loses his horse to a band of robbers, but finds help with the childish but amicable forest-dweller Marius and the monks of a nearby monastery. He eventually makes his way to a castle named Mistrinaut, where he is found and imprisoned for execution by the Grey Knights, who (as it turns out later) were close friends of the knight with the white shield and believe Tiuri to be his murderer. However, Sigirdiwarth Rafox, the lord of Mistrinaut, and his daughter Lavinia supply Tiuri with weapons to save his life, and in the end Tiuri convinces the knights of his innocence and befriends them, especially their leader, Ristridin of the South, a famous wandering knight from Dagonaut's realm. From Ristridin, Tiuri finally learns the name of the black knight with the white shield - Edwinem of Foresterra, a renowned hero from Unauwen's realm - and of his steed Ardanwen; the stranger who sent Tiuri on his quest turns out to be Edwinem's squire, Vokia. As it is gradually revealed, the murder of Edwinem and the letter Tiuri carries are pivotal elements in a festering conflict between the realm of Unauwen and the realm of Evillan, a kingdom south of Dagonaut's domain. The ruler of Evillan is the younger of Unauwen's twin sons, who is torn by jealousy toward his elder brother and, seeking dominion over his father's realm, has conquered Evillan to support his own ends. He thinks that he is the one in the prophecies. In the company of the Grey Knights, Tiuri survives an ambush attempt by the Red Riders and some hired thugs, and safely reaches the base of the mountains, where he parts company with the knights. As he makes his way to Menaures' abode, he is met by a man called Jaro, who claims to be a pilgrim seeking the hermit's advice, and a short while later Tiuri ends up saving Jaro from a fatal fall into a ravine. Tiuri and Jaro later encounter Menaures and Piak, a young mountain boy whose services as a guide is offered by Menaures after he has learned of Tiuri's quest. Shortly after their departure, Jaro reveals himself to be one of the Red Riders sent to kill him, but since Tiuri has saved his life, Jaro finds himself unable to do him any harm. Before he departs, he warns Tiuri of another Red Rider, a vile and cunning individual named Slupor (Slither in the English version), who will be waiting for him in Unauwen's realm. Piak, who has overheard the conversation, pledges himself to Tiuri and his errand, and in the days that they spend crossing the mountains, the two become fast friends. The two boys arrive safely in the realm of Unauwen, but the spies and agents of Evillan are everpresent. In the city of Dangria, the mayor, an agent and sympathizer to Evillan, attempts to imprison the boys under false pretenses, but a diversion by Piak allows Tiuri to hide long enough to memorize the contents of the letter and destroy it. While attempting to free Piak, Tiuri receives help from the disgruntled citizens who have long been displeased with the despotic mayor, although only few ever suspected him being an agent of Evillan. Piak is liberated and the mayor's true allegiance exposed, but not daring to be delayed on their errand, Tiuri and Piak run away before the newly elected provisory town council can question them. Their next obstacle meets them at the Rainbow River in the form of a castle serving as a customs station. Without money to pay the toll, Tiuri and Piak decide to cross the river by stealth, but end up shipwrecked and captured. When Tirui is brought before Sir Ardian, the local Lord of Customs, he attempts to bargain for his and Piak's release by offering Edwinem's ring as a deposit. Upon recognizing the ring, and after learning about Edwinem's demise and that Tiuri carries an important message for the king, Sir Ardian promptly provides the two boys with an escort to the capital. Slupor manages to draw away the Custom guards and awaits Tiuri and Piak at the very gates of the capital, but his last-ditch attempt at Tiuri's life is foiled, and he is arrested. Now able to fulfill their quest, Tiuri and Piak deliver the message the letter contained to King Unauwen. It is later revealed that the letter was a warning about the Lord of Evillan's treacherous plans which formed the core of his reconciliation attempt, since he has planned to murder his brother once the realm of Unauwen was lulled into a sense of peace and security, thereby making him the only claimant to the throne. With a heavy heart, Unauwen calls the knights of his realm to arms to prepare for war and rewards Tiuri and Piak for their valiant service to his kingdom. Soon after, Tiuri and Piak depart for Dagonaut's realm, following the same path they have taken for their outward journey. After arriving at Menaures' abode, Piak, who feels torn between his friendship with Tiuri and his home in the mountains, parts company with Tiuri, who continues his return journey alone. On his way, he meets again with most of his friends and allies, including Ristridin, who invites him to his castle in the coming spring once he has completed an errand for King Dagonaut to explore the Wild Wood, a wild and desolate forest area lining the realm's southern border. After an uneventful journey, Tiuri returns to the capital of Dagonaut's realm, where he is welcomed back by the king and his family. To Tiuri's immense surprise, and quite against his expectations to the contrary, he subsequently finds himself made a full knight; even though having broken the rules of tradition, Tiuri has proven that he already is a true knight due to his sense of honor, his dedication and compassion in accepting Edwinem's quest as his own. Tiuri's joy is completed when the very next day Piak arrives at the capital, having changed his mind and decided to join Tiuri as his friend and squire. The story is continued in Geheimen van het Wilde Woud (Secrets of the Wild Woods).

The school was formerly known as Burncoat Senior High School chiefly to distinguish it from the adjacent Burncoat Junior High School, now Burncoat Middle School. Burncoat is known for its fine arts program, known as \\"Burncoat Fine Arts Magnet Program,\\" which includes visual and performing arts such as theatre, music, dance, media arts chorus and art. Principal William Foley has said the fine arts program \\"has been in existence for 23 years, and it begins at the middle school level and continues through high school... The fine arts program at Burncoat is unlike any other in that it provides students the opportunity to develop the techniques and skills that will allow them to express themselves through the universal mediums of the arts... No other school in our area can offer their students this type of opportunity.‚Äù Burncoat High School offers an array of Advanced Placement (AP) courses and has a wide range of programs including AVID, COAST Program for students on the Autism Spectrum, Life Skills Program, Best Buddies, S.T.E.P. (Structured Therapeutic Educational Program) for students with emotional challenges and offers Virtual High School (VHS) classes. Burncoat is one of several Worcester Public Schools to be involved with the Massachusetts Math and Science Initiative (MMSI). MMSI drives a school culture of high expectations and dramatically increases participation and performance in Advanced Placement courses, particularly among underserved populations, to prepare students for college and career success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The school's rivals are North High School, Doherty Memorial High School, and South High Community School. Burncoat plays a significant role in the Worcester community and Burncoat and Greendale neighborhoods. Students at Burncoat have helped to organize the Burncoat Beetle Battle, and have contributed to the Be Like Brit Foundation and Children's Hospital Boston, among other organizations. Burncoat has a long-lasting relationship with The Hanover Insurance Group, which contributes to the school significantly. The school has about 1,100 students, in grades 9 to 12, in the Worcester Public Schools district. The school's principal is William P. Foley. Foley graduated from Burncoat in 1986 and taught there for 10 years. Most recently, before coming back to Burncoat in 2007 as principal, Foley was an assistant principal at Doherty Memorial High School. The school serves the north side of Worcester.Quadrant map of district Competitive teams=FIRST Robotics Since 2006 Burncoat High School has competed in the FIRST Robotics Competition. The team is known as the Green Reapers and is sponsored by Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Boston Scientific.

The Burncoat football team won the Central Mass Super Bowl championship in 2004 against St. Josephs's.  Rachel's Challenge  In the fall of 2010, the Burncoat High School National Honor Society brought Rachel's Challenge to the school. Rachel Scott was the first person killed at Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. Her acts of kindness and compassion coupled with the contents of her six diaries have become the foundation for one of the most life-changing school programs in America. Powerful video/audio footage of Rachel's life and the Columbine tragedy holds students spell-bound during a one-hour school presentation that motivates them to positive change in the way they treat others.  Partnership with Quinsigamond Community College  Quinsigamond Community College has partnered with Burncoat High School for its automotive program. QCC has access to classroom, automotive shop, parking and storage space at Burncoat at the end of the high school day. In exchange, the college will pay the high school $15,687 annually, provide two to three seats each year for Burncoat graduates to enroll in the program and allow up to two high school students to participate as a dual enrollment program (in which high school students take college courses and earn credit in both schools). Quinsigamond will also provide upgraded equipment and tools that the high school can use during the day. The program does not disrupt Burncoat's existing automotive program. The partnership with Burncoat is the first step in creating a Center for Advanced Transportation Technology in Worcester. Instructional focus At Burncoat High School, all students will experience a rigor based curriculum taught through instructional strategies meant to improve reading comprehension as measured by MAP, MCAS, PSAT, SAT, MEPA and AP scores as well as other formative assessments.

Background Smoke's mother Looking Walker Woman was Teton Oglala Lakota, and his father, Body Parts, was Teton Sih√°sapa Lakota. He had a maternal uncle named Stone Chief or Knife. Smoke was the brother to White Cow Woman and Walks As She Thinks. When Smoke was born his parents named him \\"Standing Bull\\" after his paternal grandfather Standing Buffalo. In his youth he was given a Toklala's name Smoke, then later on, he honored his fourth son \\"Bad Face\\" by giving him his name Smoke. He took the name of Slow Buffalo Bull, but the Smoke name stuck with him until he died. Accomplishments In 1849, Old Chief Smoke moved his W√°glu»üe camp to Ft. Laramie, Wyoming. W√°glu»üe were considered by the U.S. Army and Indian agents to be the most progressive band of Lakota and many became Indian Police, U.S. Army Indian Scouts with the U.S. 4th Cavalry Regiment from Ft. Laramie, Wyoming, and intermediaries with other bands of Lakotas. Chief Smoke was a great horse capturer and great warrior in his youth. He achieved military accomplishments, and, later on, he rose rapidly as a major and prominent and recognizable headman. Eventually the people and council of the Lakotas chose him as one of the main-chiefs. After the H√∫≈ãkpa‚Äôti‚Ä≤la's headman Stone Knife's death in 1797, Old Man Smoke was the head chief of one of the major prominent and most dominant and largest seven Lakota divisions: the Teton H√∫≈ãkpa‚Äôti‚Ä≤la (The Camp at the End of the Circle), later on, better known as the Oglala Lakota Sioux Nation from around 1797‚Äì1800 to 1864. He is most noted for co-founding the Oglala's name (Those Who Scatter Their Owns) in 1834. The tribe solidified under central governance of Smoke when he became chief in 1797 but the tribe became loosely organized and split into two factions. When Smoke's rival cousin Bull Bear tried to overthrow him as the main chief in 1834, he did not succeed. Instead he became the first chief of the Eastern Oglalas, when Smoke separated the tribe into two divisions, Kiyaska and It√©≈°iƒça bands. The Kiyaska name meaning \\"Cutt Offs\\" came about when Smoke told Bull Bear and his followers that they were cut off from the tribe. The It√©≈°iƒça name meaning \\"Bad Faces\\" originated from when Bull Bear threw some dust in the face of Smoke after he told Bull Bear that he been cut off.\\"North American Indian Timeline (1492‚Äì1999).\\" The Latin Library. (retrieved 17 Oct 2010) His longstanding feud with Bull Bear which resulted in Bull Bear's death by the hands of Red Cloud in 1841.\\"Lakota Society: The Tetons.\\" Lodge of ≈†ung'manitu-I≈°na. (retrieved 17 Oct 2010) Chief Smoke's headdress wasn't just another ordinary headdress. In fact it wasn't like any other chief's headdress it was amazingly detailed and designed with the finest and longest eagle feathers available. It was longer than Chief Touch the Clouds's headdress, and it had special significance. Indeed, it was most honored and sacred among the Lakotas. When Chief Smoke stood or walked in full headdress, there was a magnificent train of eagle feathers trailing or dragging on the ground for many feet behind him. He earned these eagle feathers one by one. The Lakota people made and awarded him this headdress for his status as a great warrior as well as his many good deeds and a life devoted to and for his people. Chief Smoke's height was 6 feet 5 inches, and he weighed at least 250 pounds and was robust. Family In 1864, Old Chief Smoke died and was placed on a scaffold near sight of Ft. Laramie. Chief Smoke is also noted for having had five wives; Looking Cloud Woman of the Teton Mnik»ü√≥wo≈æu, Comes Out Slow Woman of the Teton Ogl√°la, Burnt Her Woman of the Teton Siƒçh√°≈ã«ßu, Yellow Haired Woman of the Southern Cheyenne, and Brown Eyes Woman of the Teton H√∫≈ãkpap»üa. His children included Spotted Horse Woman, Chief Man Afraid of His Horses I, Chief Red Cloud was his \\"nephew\\" and was raised by Smoke after his parents deaths, Chief Bull Bear III, Chief Solomon \\"Smoke\\" II, Chief American Horse I, Chief Big Mouth, Chief Blue Horse,Bray 316 Woman Dress,Bray 316 and Chief No Neck.Bray 316 He also had a daughter, Ulala. Only eight out of nine sons of the old Chief Smoke were prominent chiefs of a band of the Lakotas. Big Mouth and Blue Horse were twin brothers and they were born in the same year as their cousin Chief Red Cloud, 1822. Spotted Horse Woman was from Smoke's first wife Looking Cloud Woman, Man Afraid of His Horses I and Solomon \\"Smoke\\" II was from Smoke's second wife Comes Out Slow Woman, Big Mouth and Blue Horse was from Smoke's third wife Burnt Her Woman, American Horse I and Woman Dress was from Smoke's fourth wife Yellow Haired Woman, No Neck was from Smoke's fifth wife Brown Eyes Woman. The Smoke family was the most prominent and recognized family of the Lakotas during the 18th and 19th centuries. He was one of the last great Shirt Wearers, a highly prestigious Lakota warrior society.Bray 121 In 1864 before Chief Smoke died, he gave his War Shirt as a gift to Col. William O. Collins after the visit that Col. Collins made to the Smoke's camp. Col. Collins sent the shirt to the Smithsonian Institution as a donation in 1866. The shirt is presently in the collections of the National Museum of Natural History: Catalog No. E1851, Department of Anthropology. The last chiefs in the original dynasty of Oglala headmen starting with the great Chief Smoke (1774‚Äì1864) were Frank Afraid of His Horses (1856‚Äì1943, his chieftainship 1900‚Äì1943) and Wendell Smoke (1876‚Äì1920, his chieftainship 1895‚Äì1920). Death Chief Smoke died in 1864 nearby Fort Laramie, Wyoming at the age of 89, he died from natural causes of old age. A few days after his death, an Army Surgeon Lt. Colonel Henry Schell, stationed at Fort Laramie removed the body of Chief Smoke and sent to the Smithsonian Institution Museum. 130 years later the remains of Chief Smoke was returned in 1994 to the Smoke family, and they buried him by the town of Porcupine, South Dakota.

England's economy was fundamentally agricultural throughout the period, but the mining of iron, tin, lead and silver, and later coal, played an important part within the English medieval economy. Invasion and the early Norman period (1066‚Äì1100) William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066, defeating the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings and placing the country under Norman rule. This campaign was followed by fierce military operations known as the Harrying of the North between 1069 and 1070, extending Norman authority across the north of England. William's system of government was broadly feudal in that the right to possess land was linked to service to the king, but in many other ways the invasion did little to alter the nature of the English economy and mining enterprises.Dyer 2009, p.8. Mid-medieval growth (1100‚Äì1290) Early iron-smelting using a bloomery. Mining did not make up a large part of the English medieval economy, but the 12th and 13th centuries saw an increased demand for metals in England, thanks to the considerable population growth and building construction, including the great cathedrals and churches.Hodgett, p.158; Barnes, p.245. Four metals were mined commercially in England during the period: iron, tin, lead and silver using a variety of refining techniques.Homer, p.57; Bayley pp131-2. Coal was also mined from the 13th century onwards, Iron mining occurred in several locations including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean, as well as in Durham and the Weald.Geddes, p.169; Bailey, p.54. Some iron to meet English demand was also imported from the continent, especially by the late 13th century.Geddes, p.169. By end of the 12th century, the older method of acquiring iron ore through strip mining was being supplemented by more advanced techniques, including tunnels, trenches and bell-pits. Iron ore was usually locally processed at a bloomery and by the 14th century the first water-powered iron forge in England was built at Chingley.Geddes, p.169, 172. As a result of the diminishing woodlands and consequent increases in the cost of both wood and charcoal, demand for coal increased in the 12th century and began to be commercially produced from bell-pits and strip mining.Bailey, p.52. A silver boom occurred in England after the discovery of silver near Carlisle in 1133. Huge quantities of silver were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland - up to three to four tonnes of silver were mined each year, more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe.Blanchard, p.29. The result was a local economic boom and a major uplift to 12th century royal finances.Blanchard, p.33. Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon, exploiting alluvial deposits and governed by the special Stannary Courts and Parliaments - tin formed a valuable export good, initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries.Homer, p.57, pp61-2; Bailey, p.55. Lead was usually mined as a by-product of mining for silver, with mines in Yorkshire, Durham and the north, as well as in Devon.Homer, p57, p.62. Economically fragile, the lead mines usually survived as a result of being subsidised by silver production.Homer, p.62. Mid-medieval economic crisis - the Great Famine and the Black Death (1290‚Äì1350) The Black Death reached England in 1348 from Europe. Great Famine The Great Famine of 1315 began a number of acute crises in the English agrarian economy. The famine centred on a sequence of harvest failures in 1315, 1316 and 1321, combined with an outbreak of the murrain sickness amongst sheep and oxen between 1319 and 1321 and the fatal ergotism fungi amongst the remaining stocks of wheat.Cantor 1982a, p.20; Aberth, p.14. In the ensuing famine, many people died and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses, dogs and cats as well to have conducted cannibalism against children, although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations.Aberth, pp13-4. The Great Famine firmly reversed the population growth of the 12th and 13th centuries and left a domestic economy that was \\"profoundly shaken, but not destroyed\\".Jordan, p.78; Hodgett, p.201. Black Death The Black Death epidemic first arrived in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360-2, 1368-9, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter.Dyer 2009, p.271, 274; Hatcher 1996, p.37. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40-70% amongst the peasantry.Dyer 2009, p.272, Hatcher 1996, p.25.The precise mortality figures for the Black Death have been debated at length for many years. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether.Dyer 2009, p.274. The medieval authorities did their best to respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense.Dyer 2009, pp272-3. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused.Dyer 2009, p.273. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions.Fryde and Fryde, p.753. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence.Hatcher 1996, p.61. The crisis would affect English mining for the remainder of the medieval period.Dyer 2009, p.278. Late medieval economic recovery (1350‚Äì1509) Mining generally performed well at the end of the medieval period, helped by buoyant demand for manufactured and luxury goods. Cornish tin production plunged during the Black Death itself, leading to a doubling of prices.Homer, p.58. Tin exports also collapsed catastrophically, but picked up again over the next few years.Hatcher 1996, p.40. By the turn of the 16th century, the available alluvial tin deposits in Cornwall and Devon had begun to decline, leading to the commencement of bell and surface mining to support the tin boom that occurred in the late 15th century.Bailey, p.55. Lead mining increased, with output almost doubling between 1300 and 1500. Wood and charcoal became cheaper once again after the Black Death, and coal production declined as a result, remaining depressed for the rest of the period - nonetheless, some coal production was occurring in all the major English coalfields by the 16th century.Bailey, p.54. Iron production continued to increase; the Weald in the South-East began to make increased use of water-power, and overtook the Forest of Dean in the 15th century as England's main iron-producing region. The first blast furnace in England, a major technical step forward in metal smelting, was created in 1496 in Newbridge in the Weald.Geddes, p.174. NotesReferencesBibliography * Aberth, John.

Distribution Distichlis bajaensis is endemic to Baja California, Mexico, where it is known from only one location in a salt marsh just outside Rosarito. The habitat is an arroyo with saline and alkaline soils which is grazed by goats and burros. The grass grows alongside other halophytes including spiny rush (Juncus acutus), iodinebush (Allenrolfea occidentalis), and pickleweed (Salicornia sp.). Genetic and morphological analyses show that the plant is not any other Distichlis, nor a hybrid of the two most closely related Distichlis, and it was described to science as a new species in 2010. Description Distichlis bajaensis is a rhizomatous perennial grass growing in short clumps and spreading via stolons. The leaf blades are no more than 1.5 centimeters long and are slightly bent; this bend is a good characteristic for identifying this grass in the field. Like other Distichlis, Baja grass is dioecious, with male and female inflorescences; only the male inflorescence has been included in the official description because no good female specimens have been collected.

It was built for Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh, the twelfth Emperor of the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty. It was built from 1920 to 1931 taking 11 years to complete. The tomb is a blend of Western and Eastern architecture. It is located on a steep hill outside of the capital city of Hu·∫ø.  History  In 1916, Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh became the Emperor of Vietnam. The Emperor worked closely with the government of France, and by the end of his reign he was considered to be nothing more than \\"a salaried employee of the French government.\\" Due to this close collaboration, he was very unpopular amongst the people of Vietnam. Like a number of Vietnamese emperors, Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh desired the preparation of a tomb in anticipation of his death, but he was the last member of the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty to make this decision. Construction began in 1920 and concluded in 1931, with the Emperor increasing tax by 30 percent to fund the lavish mausoleum. Before his 1925 death, the Emperor visited France where he was likely influenced by the architectural styles there, evidenced by the European influences in his Oriental mausoleum. The tomb was completed by B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh's successor, in 1931.  Architecture  The interior of the mausoleum temple featuring porcelain art Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh's tomb's surface area is much smaller than the tombs of his predecessors. However, the building itself is far more elaborately designed than others of its era, being a mix of a number of architectural styles. The tomb is of a rectangular structure leaning against Chau Chu Mountain in the outskirts of Hu·∫ø. The side walls are formed by the biggest sculptures of dragons in all of Vietnam. The tomb is home to an imperial audience court, featuring a reinforced concrete stele monument, as well as twelve stone statues representing bodyguards. Close to the top floor is the Khai Thanh Palace, featuring intricately designed glass and porcelain decorations on the walls. The ceiling of the palace is decorated with nine intricate dragons.

Born in Ireland, he was educated at St Peter's College, Wexford, and at the Franciscan College of St Isidore, Rome, Sheil was sent to the British Colony of New South Wales in Australia after being ordained a priest. There, he served as an educator and administrator, before poor health saw him move to Ballarat as archdeacon. In 1866, Sheil became the third Bishop of Adelaide. His reign was characterised by poor administration, with his extensive absence from the diocese contributing to severe factionalism within the clergy. Sheil's mismanagement culminated in his excommunication of Mary MacKillop, who later became Australia's first saint. He died in March 1872, rescinding his excommunication of MacKillop on his deathbed.  Early life  Sheil was born on 24 December 1815 in Wexford, Ireland. From 1832, he attended the Franciscan College of St Isidore in Rome, where he taught after he was ordained in 1839. After serving as guardian of the convents of St Francis at Cork and Carrickbeg, Sheil travelled to Melbourne, Australia, arriving on 12 February 1853. There, he served as the secretary and manager of the Victorian Catholic education board, and taught at a Melbourne seminary. Sheil's failing health saw him moved to Ballarat in 1859, where he became archdeacon. In 1866 he was chosen to replace Patrick Geoghegan as Bishop of Adelaide.  Episcopacy  After being consecrated on 15 August 1866 by the Bishop of Melbourne, James Goold, Sheil was installed as Bishop of Adelaide on 16 September, that year. The diocese of Australia expanded significantly during Sheil's term as bishop. The number of priests rose from 17 to 30, and a number of new parishes were founded. The founding of the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1866 by Mary Mackillop and Julian Tenison Woods contributed to a large improvement in Catholic education within the diocese. Sheil appointed Woods as the director general of Catholic education in the diocese, and by 1871, there were 71 Catholic schools in the diocese, more than half run by the Josephites. Although Sheil had been an effective educator in Victoria, his episcopacy was characterised by weak leadership and poor administration. His travels to Europe to recruit priests and attend the First Vatican Council meant that he spent less than two years of his six-year reign in the diocese. In the absence of effective leadership, clergy disunity became rife, with a factional grouping forming around the Franciscan priest Charles Horan. In 1871, when Sheil returned from a visit to Europe, Horan's faction alleged that the Josephites were incompetent and ignorant, petitioning him to take direct control of the order. Sheil, who was increasingly acting under Horan's influence, demoted Tenison Woods from his administrative position within the diocese, disbanded the Josephite novitiate and sought to bring the charitable activities and schools operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph under the direct control of local bishops. In doing so, he removed Tenison Woods and MacKillop from their positions of influence within the order. MacKillop refused to submit, and in response, Sheil excommunicated her for disobedience. C. J. Fox, editor and proprietor of the Catholic Irish Harp newspaper ran an article highly critical of the bishop's treatment of MacKillop and her order. Fox was then ousted by the Catholic Association, of which he was president, for his candid criticism of Catholic hierarchy. Fox was one of many who consistently misspelled the bishop's name as \\"Shiel\\". These events were reported by the mainstream Register, the outcome of which was a number of \\"Letters to the Editor\\" sympathetic to MacKillop, who was well respected by Catholics and Protestants alike. A group of Catholic laymen wrote to Cardinal Alessandro Barnab√≤, Prefect of the Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith in Rome. The letter was strongly critical of Sheil's excommunication of MacKillop, the management of diocesan finances and impropriety within the clergy. Throughout early 1872, Sheil's health deteriorated seriously, a fact that was denied by his personal physician. On his deathbed in Willunga, he rescinded his excommunication of MacKillop, claiming he had been betrayed by his advisors. He died of a carbuncle on 1 March 1872.  Legacy  After Sheil's death, two reports into his episcopacy and the state of the Diocese of Adelaide were conducted. The first, written by a Jesuit priest in the diocese to his Father-General in Rome, was fiercely critical of Sheil's recruitment of priests from Ireland. Of the 21 priests he had brought to the diocese, the report stated that one had died, one had such poor health as to be useless, five had been dismissed for impropriety, five had insufficient knowledge to be effective as priests and six had become involved in diocesan factionalism. Not only, the report alleged, had only two of the twenty-one recruited priests been useful, but many of them had known deficiencies before Sheil recruited them. The second report, commissioned by the Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith, was conducted by Bishop of Hobart Daniel Murphy and Bishop of Bathurst Matthew Quinn. Murphy and Quinn travelled around the diocese, inspecting parishes and collecting evidence. Having concluded their investigations, they expelled Charles Horan and other factional leaders from the diocese, and recommended Christopher Reynolds (who had been acting as administrator of the Diocese since Sheil's death) be appointed as the next Bishop of Adelaide.

The 2007 Rushmoor Council election took place on 3 May 2007 to elect members of Rushmoor Borough Council in Hampshire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 28 *Liberal Democrat 8 *Labour 5 *Independent 1 Campaign Before the election the Conservatives held 26 seats, the Liberal Democrats 10, Labour 5 and 1 independent. 14 seats were being contested with candidates from the 3 main parties on the council, as well as 4 from the British National Party, 1 Official Monster Raving Loony Party and 1 independent. Issues in the election included the recent introduction of alternate weekly collection of rubbish and recycling, town centre redevelopments, council tax and anti-social behaviour. The independent councillor Peter Sandy collected 6,000 signatures on a petition against the change in refuse collection, describing it as greed and predicting the Conservatives would lose control as a result. Another issue that arose during the campaign was the responsibility for a new play area in North Town, Aldershot, with different parties claiming the credit. Rushmoor saw a trial of internet voting with votes able to be cast this way in the week before the election. 6,600 voters had registered to vote online as well as 5,500 who had opted to vote by post. When the online voting opened however there was a problem with the Conservative candidate in Wellington ward being placed against the Labour emblem, but this was spotted and corrected sufficiently quickly that the candidates accepted that the result had not been compromised. Election result The results saw the Conservatives keep control of the council with an increased majority after gaining 2 seats from the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives gained in Cove and Southwood by 226 votes and in West Heath by 144 votes to hold 28 of the 42 seats. The Liberal Democrats defended the other 2 seats they had held, after coming closest to gaining a seat in St Mark's ward where the Conservatives had a majority of 40. Labour held their 2 seats, while an independent who had campaigned against alternate week refuse collection was well beaten in Knellwood by Conservative Roland Dibbs who won 56% of the vote. The trial of internet voting failed to increase turnout, which dropped to 35.2% from the 36% in the 2006 election. In total 3,827 of the 6,686 people registered to vote online did so, 57.2%, with disagreement over whether the trial was a success. Following the election the only independent councillor, Peter Sandy, resigned from the council causing a by-election in Heron Wood ward.

It was the Danish National Chamber Orchestra from 1939 to 2014, when it was under the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR). Since 2015, it has been funded privately. The roots of the orchestra date back to 1927, with the formation of an orchestra to perform light music at the Hotel Phoenix by Louis Preil. By 1933, (Louis Preil's Dance Orchestra) consisted of 22 musicians and attained great popularity in Denmark via radio transmissions. In 1939, DR then formally established the ( \\"Danish Radio Entertainment Orchestra\\") as the national broadcaster's in-house orchestra. It focused on lighter, popular repertoire. Teddy Petersen took over direction of the ensemble in 1943. The repertoire of the orchestra included classical repertoire such as Mozart, to modern musicals and more recently, collaborations with rock groups. During the tenure of chief conductor √Åd√°m Fischer, which began in 1999, the orchestra made a number of commercial recordings of symphonies and operas by Mozart. As of 2014, the orchestra numbered 42 performers. In September 2014, DR announced the disbanding of the orchestra, effective 1 January 2015, citing budget cutbacks. Protests at the decision resulted, including objections to the haste of the decision by the DR board of directors, and that the Minister of Culture, Marianne Jelved, had authorised the dismantling before the orchestra had the opportunity to present a savings plan to allow it to continue. The orchestra gave its final performance as a DR ensemble on 21 November 2014, with a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. The musicians of the orchestra then began a crowdfunding campaign to keep the orchestra in existence. Via Kickstarter, this campaign raised 1,000,000 DKK in funds from private individuals, and several Danish corporations pledged the remaining 2,000,000 DKK. Because of Kickstarter's single-donation limits (50,000 DKK), the orchestra was required to cancel its Kickstarter account, to return those donations, and to request that donors re-submit their donations in cash by 28 February 2015. After ending its affiliation with DR, the orchestra renamed itself the ( \\"Danish Entertainment Orchestra\\"), and its English official name dropped the word \\"national\\", becoming \\"Danish Chamber Orchestra\\". It gave its first concert as a privately funded ensemble on 1 February 2015 at the Royal Danish Academy of Music.

Career Born in Philadelphia, Venuti graduated from Temple University. In 1980 he completed the Ph.D. in English at Columbia University, where he studied with historically oriented literary scholars such as Joseph Mazzeo and Edward Tayler as well as theoretically engaged cultural and social critics such as Edward Said and Sylvere Lotringer. That year he received the Renato Poggioli Award for Italian Translation for his translation of Barbara Alberti's novel Delirium.Barbara Alberti translated by Venuti Venuti is Professor Emeritus of English at Temple University, where he taught for forty years (1980-2020). He has taught as a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Columbia University, Universit√† degli Studi di Trento, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit√§t Mainz, Barnard College, and Queen's University Belfast.

In 1999 he held a Fulbright Senior Lectureship in translation studies at the University of Vic (Catalonia).Lawrence Venuti at Temple University In 2007 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for his translation of Giovanni Pascoli's poetry and prose.Guggenheim Fellowship granted to Lawrence Venuti In 2008 his translation of Ernest Farr√©s's Edward Hopper: Poems won the Robert Fagles Translation Prize. In 2018 his translation of J.V. Foix's Daybook 1918: Early Fragments won the Global Humanities Translation Prize sponsored by Northwestern University's Buffett Institute for Global Studies and Alice Kaplan Institute for the Humanities. Thought and influence Venuti has concentrated on the theory and practice of translation. He is considered one of the most critically minded figures in modern translation theory, often with positions that substantially differ from those of mainstream theorists. He criticizes the fact that, too frequently, the translator is an invisible figure. He has been engaged in translation criticism ever since he started translating.Lawrence Venuti by Javier Ortiz (in Spanish) His seminal work, The Translator's Invisibility: A History of Translation, has been a source of debate since its publication. In it, he lays out his theory that so-called \\"domesticating practices\\" at work in translating cultures have contributed to the reduction or suppression of the linguistic and cultural differences of source texts as well as the marginality of translation. He claims that a range of constraints--discursive, cultural, ideological, legal--entails that \\"'faithful rendition' is defined partly by the illusion of transparency,\\" whereby a translation comes to be read as the source text and the translator's interpretive labor is effaced, a labor that always involves assimilating the source text to receiving cultural values. As a result, \\"foreignizing\\" or experimental types of translation are \\"likely to encounter opposition from publishers and large segments of Anglophone readers who read for immediate intelligibility\\", although he is careful to observe that the same development occurs worldwide, regardless of the degree of prestige that a language and culture may hold in the shifting global hierarchy. This situates translation under a \\"discursive regime\\" in which \\"fluency\\" is narrowly defined as adherence to the current standard dialect of the translating language, preempting discursive forms that might register difference along with the translator's presence. As a solution to this problem, Venuti puts forward the strategy of foreignization, which aims at \\"sending the reader abroad\\" in the sense of challenging dominant values in the receiving culture, instead of \\"bringing the author back home\\", as is the case when a translation contributes to the reinforcement of those values. Comparative literature scholar Susan Bassnett points out Venuti's emphasis on a translator-centered translation and his insistence that translators should inscribe themselves visibly into the text.Constructing Cultures: Essays on Literary Translation by Susan Bassnett and Andr√© Lefevere This emphasis requires that a translation be read not only as a text that establishes a semantic correspondence and a stylistic approximation to the source text, but also as a text in its own right that transforms its source and therefore is relatively autonomous from it.

Sharif was formerly associated with the underground Arab nationalist and Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. Sharif is a Sunni Muslim. On 17 March 2011, Sharif was arrested in his home in Manama for his role in the Bahraini uprising, which called for greater political freedom and for the rights of the Shia majority. Shortly after, Amnesty International reported allegations that he was being tortured by state security forces while in detention. The organization named him a prisoner of conscience, and called for his immediate release. On 22 March 2011, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Bahrain announced a decision to revoke all licenses from Bahraini telecom firm 2Connect, of which more than 10 percent was owned by Sharif as of 22 March 2011. According to the Gulf Daily News, rumors of the suspension had been circulating since 14 March 2011, although the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority had initially denied these rumors. In a statement to the Gulf Daily News on 23 March 2011, founder and managing director Fahad Shirawi revealed that the company had initiated a process to ensure that the company was 100% owned by himself, a group of Saudi investors, and the employees. The decision to revoke 2Connect's licenses was reversed on 13 April 2011. Also on 13 April 2011, 2Connect released a statement saying that Shirawi was stepping down from his position as managing director and leaving 2Connect after seven years of service, for personal reasons. Sharif was sentenced to five years in prison on 22 June 2011. In September 2012, an appeal court upheld his sentence, despite determining that the evidence against him had been obtained by means of torture. Sharif was released from imprisonment on 20 June 2015.

Settlers from the Edgefield District, South Carolina, organized the Sardis Baptist Church on June 10, 1837. The first building, a log cabin, was constructed in 1841 after John M. Dozier and his wife, Amy Youngblood Dozier, deeded four and one-half acres to the church for a building and cemetery. The present building, constructed in 1850, is an exceptionally fine example of rural antebellum church architecture of Greek Revival style. Relatively unaltered since construction, its four columns support a full entablature and low-pitched roof. Each of the two primary entrances have double-paneled doors trimmed with unadorned molding, and each side of the building has four tall, shuttered, 18-light windows. The church ultimately became inactive in the 1950s. The building was renovated and repaired in 1940-41 and then again in 1992-93. In the cemetery, the oldest tombstone bears the name of Moses E. Martin, died May 18, 1848. Part of the cemetery near the church served the African-American community during the early years. As the need arose for more space, William Andrew Martin and his wife, Nancy Strom Martin, who had bought the adjoining land from the Doziers in 1860, allowed the church to extend the cemetery southward onto their property. Sardis School, a community school, was located on the church property across the highway from the church on the corner of Highway 223 and County Road 22. Newspaper articles indicate the school was operating in 1861 and 1870. The old Sardis School building was subsequently moved east on County Road 22 where it became, as it remains today, the living room of the Livingston Paulk home. In 1867, the Buena Vista Masonic Lodge No. 169 was located just north of the church property. The church was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on December 19, 1991 and the National Register of Historic Places on November 29, 2001.

The branching stems are hairless, waxy in texture, and greenish to purple in color. The basal leaves have thick, oblong to lance- shaped blades up to 15 centimeters long with smooth or rippled edges. Leaves higher on the plant have much smaller blades which may clasp the stem at their bases. The inflorescence is an erect, open raceme of widely spaced flowers. The petals are usually lavender, or occasionally white, and are narrow and linear in shape, sometimes crinkled. The fruit is a narrow, cylindrical silique up to 5 centimeters long. Habitat This plant is threatened by the destruction of its very limited mountain meadow habitat, which is being claimed for development and degraded by recreation, grazing, and introduced weedy plants. Changes in hydrology and soil quality impact the plant.USFWS.

It is an almost unaltered example of the simple, Greek Revival style popular for rural churches in the mid-19th century. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 1986. History The church was completed in a simple Greek Revival style in 1859, when the community was a prosperous antebellum town. The land for the church was donated by the Catterlin family, early Choctaw County settlers who had established the a post office in Mount Sterling in 1838. The one-story frame building was the first in the county to be built exclusively as a church; an earlier Baptist church was originally built as a Masonic lodge and seminary. It used for church services up until the 1970s, when the dwindling congregation could no longer afford to maintain it. See also: In 1980, the property was donated to the Choctaw County Historical Society. The historical society, at the time having only just under 50 members, spent more than 15 years raising money and restoring the structure for use as a community hall. It is one of only two remaining 19th century churches in the Mount Sterling area, the other being St. John's Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. Architecture The church is a rectangular structure with a gable roof running the length of the building. It sits on individual brick piers. The exterior is clad in lap board siding painted white. The front fa√ßade has two pairs of entry doors under the plain gable-end pediment. Each side has four, nine-over-nine sash windows with shutters, while the rear has two such windows. The square, pyramidal roofed steeple sits near the entrance end of the building, and is clad is lap board with vents in each side. A small addition, with details closely matching the main building, has been built off the southeast side of the church, with a covered walkway connecting it to the main building. The interior consists of one large room that was partitioned on the south end in the 1950s to create two Sunday school rooms. The roof support system is unique to southwest Alabama, and consists of a single truss with vertical tie rods running the length of the building, which is notched to be attached to the ceiling joists and diagonal trusses. This has caused the bottom chord to crack, and wood columns were added underneath the cracked portion. The original lath and plaster walls have been replaced with drywall, but the original heart pine flooring is intact.

Biography  Manuel de Sandoval was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico at the end of the 17th century, but the exact date of his birth is unknown. In 1707, he joined the army of Santa Fe. He showed great military capabilities and he became the Captain of the grenadiers of the regiment of Santa Fe. Sandoval served the army for over twenty years (rising from cadet to captain), and on the 4th February 1729 the King appointed him governor of Coahuila (today also a region in Mexico). He finished his term as governor of that province on the 4th September 1733.Provinces of New Spain Following his services to Coahuila, in early 1734, he was appointed the governor of Texas. As the governor of Texas, Sandoval lived \\"most of his time in Presidio San Fernando de Bexar\\" (modern San Antonio, Texas). This was slightly unusual as Los Adaes was he provincial capital of Texas at the time, but Sandoval was pre-occupied by the Apache uprisings. In 1735, the French commander at Natchitoches, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis took advantage of the situation, particularly the absence of Sandoval from the provincial capital, Los Adaes to move the French fort west of the Red River\\". The establishment a French fort in Texas was seen as an aggressive move by the Spanish Viceroy and the Government of Texas, and the beginning of a French colonization in the region. Sandoval and Jose Gonzales (his appointed deputy at Los Adaes) protested against the French and their move in Texas, but they were not able to get a withdrawal to the boundaries set before the establishment of the fort west of the Red River. In September 1736, the French invasion in Texas (which Sandoval was unable to prevent) forced to the Viceroy Vizarr√≥n y Eguiarreta to replace Sandoval with Carlos Benites Franquis de Lugo as the governor of Texas province. After Lugo Franquis came into power, he ordered the imprisonment of Sandoval, accusing him of \\"seven counts of official misconduct\\", and financial misappropriation. In 1737 the Viceroy called to Sandoval to his office to explain how he conducted the financial accounting of his administration at the time. Sandoval was acquitted of financial misappropriation, but was accused of not keeping correct book-keeping practices of his administration. He was ordered to pay a $500 fine for not having lived in Los Adaes (the administration capital) when he was governor of Texas and imprisoned for not having appropriate book- keeping practices. He spent several years in prison, finally released in 1741. After leaving prison, he continued providing military and political services to the King. He settled in Mexico City, where he worked as a Sergeant Major in the \\"Regimento Urbano del Comercio\\" (Urban Regimental of Commerce) until his death. Sandoval Case  Research conducted on the Sandoval Case was extensive and initially covered some thirty volumes. Later another forty volumes of information was collected on the events that occurred around Texas at the time. This material key important because, in the early 19th century, it was used by the great powers (Spain, France & the United States) to negotiate a settlement on Texas and to carve up its eastern border.

Released for Windows and Macintosh, the game follows an oversized, anthropomorphic snail named Mortimer, who seeks to save a fantasy world's animal population. Players pilot Mortimer‚Äîwhose shell can transform into an aircraft or submarine‚Äî through a 3D world, while solving riddles and learning simple biology. The game was announced at the May 1995 Electronic Entertainment Expo, as an attempt by LucasArts to reach a younger demographic. The game uses the Star Wars: Rebel Assault engine. The game was also displayed at E3 1996; at the show, a writer for Computer Games Strategy Plus remarked that it was \\"very hard to sneer at the pure and lustrous quality of this kiddie title.\\" Gameplay Having chosen a player-character ('Sid' or 'Sally'), the player assumes a first- person control (except during cinematic sequences) to guide Mortimer through four ecosystems (savannah, taiga, Polar Ice Cap, and desert). During travel, the player uses its cursor to revive individual animals native to the habitat, earlier identified as changed into stone figures of themselves by antagonist 'Lodius'. Upon encounter with lesser antagonists (usually cyborg-like figures employing sodium chloride against Mortimer), the cursor becomes a weapon to repel these. At the end of each level, the player encounters an anthropomorphic sentinel permitting access to the next in reward for answering a riddle, whereof the answer is always the name of a species revived by the player. After the fourth level ('desert'), the game depicts Lodius' fortress, where the player-character itself must travel a series of mazes unaccompanied by Mortimer. Having overcome the maze and answered a final riddle (whereto the answer may be Lodius; Mortimer; or their common mentor, Prof./Dr. Laslow), the player rejoins Mortimer, whereupon Lodius, attempting to petrify the player- character, changes himself into a statue, with which the protagonists return to the beginning. Characters * Sid and Sally: two children, whereof one is chosen by the player as its character. Appointed 'joint keepers' of the Medallion by Laslow. * Prof./Dr. Laslow: Mentor to all the other characters; an inventor and multidisciplinary mad scientist, who apprises the player of its task. * Mortimer: a nearly elephant-sized, slightly-anthropomorphic garden snail, from whose conversation emerges most of the story's comic relief. His shell, assuming at need the attributes of single-seated aircraft or submersible, serves as the player's vehicle both of travel and of communication with background characters. His chief weakness is exposure to sodium chloride. * The Medallion: the story's MacGuffin, resembling a stone disc centered upon a humanoid face. Stolen from Laslow by Lodius and used by him to petrify the story's wild animals and create a nightmarish fortress beyond the game's 'desert' level; thereafter separated into seven pieces, whereof Lodius retains the central 'face' while the sections of its 'rim' are protected by the sentinel 'Gates' (see below), from whom they are earned by the player's correct answers to riddles. When the player has obtained the whole 'rim', the 'face' is guarded by a carved figure in Lodius' fortress, from behind whom it speaks in a feminine voice accompanied by music. * Lodius: Antagonist; a former pupil of Laslow's, whose destructive use of the Medallion has given him a cacodemonic appearance and the ability to change living things to stone. Not seen, except in glimpses, until the game's level depicting his fortress, wherein he imprisons Mortimer and threatens to make escargot of him except in exchange for the complete Medallion, which later changes him to stone. Thereafter he re-appears in Laslow's garden as a decorative statue. * Lodius' Minions: Supporting characters; a series of cyborg-like figures divided into four categories. Each category is introduced in a different level of gameplay: the 'Salt-Shaker Hornets' in the Savannah; the 'Beastie Bags' in the Forest; the 'Whopping Poppers' in the Arctic; and the 'Hopspitters' in Lodius' Fortress. Each is overcome by a designated number of cursor clicks representing amounts of mucus launched by the character's artillery. Of the four categories, the preceding three use sodium chloride to weaken Mortimer, where the 'Hopspitter' performs its eponymous function against the player- character itself. If the player fails to overcome the preceding three at any encounter, a short cinematic sequence depicts Mortimer falling from flight and revived at Laslow's laboratory. * Lodius' Reflection: Supporting character; a reflection of Lodius in any of the mirrors in his fortress, but possessing independent speech of his own by which he warns or flatters Lodius. * The Gates: Supporting characters; the immense sentinels guarding pieces of the broken Medallion and permitting transference from their own levels onward. Each resembles a towering humanoid face embedded in local material: the 'savannah' gate in stone; the 'taiga' or 'forest' gate in wood; the 'Arctic' gate in ice; and the 'desert' gate in stone again. Each gate speaks with a different voice, whereof the 'savannah', 'Arctic', and 'desert' gates are male while the 'forest' gate is female; and each, upon accepting Mortimer and the player-character's wish to proceed, sings a stanza extolling the environment and introducing the riddle. Upon the riddle's correct answer, the gate surrenders its piece of the Medallion and permits access to the proximate level. * The animals: Supporting character; various vertebrates native to each level, changed to statues of themselves by Lodius and revived by the player. Every time an animal is revived, a small icon appears on Mortimer's cockpit indicating that the animal is back to normal. At each 'gate', a representative of each species speaks with the player, revealing data by which the player identifies the species whose name answers the gate's riddle. Although informative, the animals' speech is often whimsical and implies a distinct personality. There are 28 animals the player may interview to get clues for the answers to each riddle, seven for each habitat. As pictured from left to right in each level in Mortimer's cockpit, the animals are: **Savannah: rhinoceros, baboon, cheetah, African elephant, giraffe, lion, oxpecker **Taiga: grizzly bear, beaver, bald eagle, flying squirrel, mountain goat, moose, opossum **Arctic: gray wolf, humpback whale, killer whale, narwhal, polar bear, Arctic tern, walrus **Desert: coyote, elf owl, Gila monster, horned lizard, long-tongued bat, rattlesnake, roadrunner * Lodius' Carving: Supporting character; a batlike visage carved into the plinth on which lies the Medallion's central piece, who sings duet with the Medallion to introduce the final riddle. * The Singers: Anthropomorphic animals who perform the song accompanying the ending-credits, describing the Medallion's ownership by Laslow, possession by Lodius, and (in future tense) recapture by the player. Reception Mortimer and the Riddles of the Medallion was nominated for several game awards, including an Emmy.

She entered service on the Marseilles to French Polynesia run. She operated in this service until the heavy competition from the Jet airliner industry caught up with Messageries Maritimes, who ended their passenger services and sold nearly their entire fleet, including Tahitien. She would next be owned by the Limassol based Aphrodite Cruises (later named Mediterranean Sun Lines) who renamed her the Atalante.History Atalante was extensively refitted for low fare cruising in the Mediterranean, a role she became mildly popular carrying out. The Atalante would be rebuilt again in 1978 and 1993, allowing her facilities and accommodations to be improved.MS Atalante After the Oceanos sank in 1991 Atalante was leased to the Epirotiki Lines, who renamed her Homericus. Her name was reverted to Atalante in 1992 and she was laid up. Later that year Atalante was purchased by Paradise Cruises. Paradise carried out her 1993 refit, which saw her superstructure extended and a showlounge added. She operated once again as a cruise ship, and her service prospered fairly successfully until scrap metal prices skyrocketed in summer 2004. Although she was in good condition, Atalante sailed to Alang, India in 2005, where she was beached and scrapped. Her sister Caledonien was scrapped in 1975.

Family background Burke was a member of the Burke family of Clanricarde, in what is now County Galway. He was one of five brothers who left Ireland to enrol in Spanish service in the late 1580s. They were in Ireland in time to participate in the Nine Years' War. They were sons of John na Seamar Burke (died 1583) and nephews of Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde (died 1601). Redmond was the eldest of the family, and styled Baron or Lord Leitrim, after his father. Annalistic extracts:1600 The Annals of the Four Masters, sub anno 1600, state: Redmond Burke, the son of John of the Shamrocks, son of James, son of Richard Saxonagh, was at this time an illustrious and celebrated gentleman, according to the usages of the Irish. He and his brothers, John Oge, William, and Thomas, remained in the two Ormonds, and in Ely, during the summer, autumn, and winter, of this year; and so great and numerous were the troops and forces of these sons of John Burke, that they ravaged and desolated all the adjacent territories and cantreds. They took many castles on this occasion in Ely and Ormond, among which were Suidhe-an-roin, Bel-atha-Dun- Gair, and Cuil-O'nDubhain, in Ely; and Port-a-Tolchain, in Ormond. 1601 The Annals of the Four Masters have a number of extracts concerning Redmond and his brothers, sub anno 1601. The sons of John of the Shamrocks, the son of Rickard Saxonagh, of whom we have already treated, happened to be encamped during the first days of the month of January in O'Meagher's country, in Ikerrin. Spies and scouts came upon them in that place from the Butlers, after it had been reported by some of their gentlemen that an advantage and opportunity could be had by attacking them in the place where they then were. For this purpose Sir Walter, the son of John, son of James Butler, and Mac Pierce, i.e. James, the son of Edmond, son of James, with some of the gentlemen of the two countries, i.e. of the county of Tipperary and of the county of Kilkenny, came to a conference and meeting on a certain night, at an appointed place. The result of their conference, and the resolution to which they agreed, was, to attack the Connaught camp at day-break next morning. An unusual accident and a sad fatality occurred to the camp of the Bourkes, namely, an advantage was taken of their want of watching, so that their enemies came into the midst of them. They left them lying mangled and slaughtered, pierced and blood-stained corpses, throughout their tents and booths. On this occasion was slain O'Shaughnessy, i.e. John, the son of Gilla- Duv, son of Dermot, son of William, who had been banished from his patrimony, as indeed had been all those plunderers who were along with the sons of John Burke. John Oge, the son of John Burke, was taken prisoner, and conveyed to Kilkenny, to be confined. Redmond Burke, and William, together with a party of their people, escaped from this affray; and they went from thence into Ely, but they did not remain long in that territory, when they proceeded into Ulster, leaving the castles which until then they had possessed in East Munster under slender guard. On their arrival among the Irish of the North, namely, O'Neill and O'Donnell, Redmond proceeded to hire soldiers, to march into Clanrickard; and, as soon as he had mustered a sufficient number of these, he led them, during the first days of spring, across the Erne, and passed along the borders of Breifny O'Rourke, through the counties of Sligo and Roscommon, and across the River Suck, into Clann-Conway. He made a prisoner of the lord of this territory, namely, Mac David (Fiach, son of Hubert Boy, son of William, son of Thomas); and he afterwards proceeded to Tuath-an-Chalaidh, in the upper part of Hy-Many, in the county of Galway. When the Earl of Clanrickard, i.e. Ulick Burke, heard of this thing, he went to the eastern extremity of his country, to await and watch Redmond; but, notwithstanding all his vigilance, Redmond, on the thirteenth night of the month of March, without being heard or noticed by the Earl or his sentinels, passed by them into Clanrickard, until he arrived in the district of Kinel- Feichin, in the south of the barony of Leitrim, in the county of Galway. Towards the end of that night, and by the dawning of day, Redmond sent forth his marauding parties through every town of that district, from Magh-glass to Crannog-Meg-Cnaimhin, and from Coill-bhreac to the mountain; and before the noon of that day Redmond had in his power the greater part of the property, and all the moveable effects, of that territory. He afterwards went to take up his abode in the woods situated in the upper part of that district, and continued for four or five days moving about in this manner, plundering his neighbours, and strengthening the ramparts around himself, until the Earl of Clanrickard, accompanied by all the troops he had been able to muster in the district, arrived, and pitched his camp at the monastery of Kinel-Fheichin. Thus they remained for four or five days, during which time some persons not illustrious were slain between them, until Teige, the son of Brian-na-Murtha, son of Brian Ballagh, son of Owen O'Rourke, arrived with bold companies of sharp-armed soldiers to assist Redmond. When these two parties combined overtook the Earl, he left the camp in which he was, and proceeded through the passes into Clanrickard. The others pursued him to Loughrea; and, the Earl and his people escaping from them on this occasion,they traversed, plundered, and burned the country from Leitrim to Ard-Maeldubhain and as far as the gate of Fead√°n, in the west of Kinelea. At this time they lost a Munster lord of a territory, i.e. MacDonough, i.e. Donough, the son of Cormac Oge, son of Cormac. What brought him on this expedition was this, he had been carried off as a hostage by O'Neill in the spring of the preceding year, and had remained in Ulster until having regained his liberty he set out with those sons of John Burke, and so fell in this war of the Clann-William. When Redmond arrived with his marauders on the confines of Thomond, they pitched a camp on the western side of Loch-Cutra. Here he was joined by a young gentleman of the Dal-Cais, namely, Teige, the son of Turlough, son of Donnell, son of Conor O'Brien, who had been induced to join him through the advice and solicitation of bad and foolish men, and without consulting or taking counsel of his father or the Earl of Clanrickard, to whom he was related and friendly. When the sons of John Burke and Teige O'Brien had entered into a confederacy with each other, Teige requested, in three days afterwards, that he should get a company to go on an incursion into some angle of Thomond. He was not refused this request, for some of the gentlemen of the camp went along with him, with their kerns. Among these were William, the son of John Burke, and the son of Mac William Burke, i.e. Walter, the son of William, son of David, son of Edmond, son of Ulick. On leaving the camp, they passed along the borders of Kinelea, and Echtghe, and Kinel-Dunghaile. They sent off marauding parties along both banks of the Fergus, into the lower part of Hy-Fearmaic, and the upper part of Clann-Cuilein. Some of them proceeded to Baile-Ui-Aille, and near Clonroad; and they returned that night with their spoils to Cill-Reachtais, in Upper Clann-Cuilein. On their leaving this town, on the following morning, they were overtaken by the rising-out of the two Clann-Cuileins, with their gentlemen. They were also overtaken by the companies of the Earl of Thomond. These pursuing forces of Thomond proceeded to shoot at the insurgents, and killed many of their men, from thence to Miliuc-Ui-Ghrada, in the east of Cenel- Donghaile. The pursuers then returned, and the others carried off the prey to their camp, after having lost some of their gentlemen and common people. Among these was that son of Mac William whom we have already mentioned, namely, Walter, the son of William Burke. Teige, the son of Turlough O' Brien, was wounded the same day by the shot of a ball; so that on his arrival at the camp he was obliged, in despite of his unbending mind and his impetuous spirit, to betake himself to the bed of sickness, and go under the hands of physicians. A great number of the Queen's people came from various places to assist the Earl of Clanrickard. Of these were eight or nine standards of soldiers, sent from the President of the two provinces of Munster. Thither came the Earl's own son, who had been for some time before along with the Lord Justice, with a band of foreign soldiers; thither also came the Deputy of the Governor of the province of Connaught, and there came also an auxiliary force from Galway. When the sons of John Burke heard of this muster, they removed back eastwards, along the mountain, into the fastnesses of the district of Kinel-Fheichin, and remained in the ready huts in which they had been before. They had not been long here when the sons of the Earl, namely, the Baron of Dunkellin and Sir Thomas Burke, with every one of his sons that was capable af bearing arms, arrived in the district in pursuit of them, at the head of very numerous forces, and pitched a splendid and well-furnished camp in the very middle of the district. The Earl of Clanrickard himself was not in this camp, for he had been attacked by a fit of sickness, and a severe, sharp disease, the week before, so that he was not able to undertake an expedition at this time. When the Deputy of the Governor of Connaught and the Baron of Dunkellin received intelligence that Teige O'Brien was lying severely wounded in that camp of Redmond Burke, they sent him a protection in behalf of the Queen, upon which he repaired to them. The Baron sent an escort with him to Leitrim, one of the Earl's castles. But he did not live long there, for he died shortly afterwards; and he was buried successively at Loughrea and Athenry in one week. Alas to the country that lost this young scion! He was expert at every warlike weapon and military engine used by the Irish on the field of battle. He was full of energy and animation, and distinguished for agility, expertness, mildness, comeliness, renown, and hospitality. As for the camps in the district of Kinel-Fheichin, they were front to front, guarding against each other daily, from the festival of St. Patrick to the end of the month of April, when the provisions and stores of flesh meat of the sons of John Burke began to grow scant and to fail; and they, therefore, proceeded to quit the territory; and after their departure they carried off a prey from O'Madden, i.e. Donnell, the son of John, son of Breasal, and then proceeded across the Suck. The sons of the Earl, in the mean time, continued to pursue them; and many persons were slain between them on this occasion. The sons of John Burke then went to Tirconnell, to O'Donnell; and the sons of the Earl returned to their own country and their houses. Kinsale Both William and Redmond were some of the chiefs who were along with Red Hugh O'Donnell at Kinsale. In the aftermath of the battle it was determined that O'Donnell, Redmond, the son of John Burke, and Captain Hugh Mus, the son of Robert, should go to Spain to complain of their distresses and difficulties to the King of Spain. O'Neill and O'Donnell determined that These chiefs left some of their neighbouring confederates in Munster, to plunder it in their absence, namely: Captain Tyrrell, the other sons of John Burke, and other gentlemen besides them.

He was born at Lee, London and died at Middleton-on-Sea, Sussex. In his two cricket appearances, Fairbanks- Smith was identified as \\"Major Fairbanks-Smith\\" and by 1921 he had been an army officer for 18 years. He joined the Royal Berkshire Regiment in 1903 as a second lieutenant. The following year, 1904, he transferred to the Middlesex Regiment, and in 1906 he was promoted to full lieutenant. In 1909 it was reported in the London Gazette that he had been seconded, but there are no details of where. By 1915, when he next appears in the Gazette listings, he was being transferred from Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry to the Durham Light Infantry with the rank of major. Fairbanks-Smith's cricket career was brief and undistinguished. Somerset played the two university sides, first Oxford and then Cambridge in consecutive matches in a single week in mid-May. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Somerset started the week at Oxford in some disarray: \\"Somerset were in such a plight that they had to complete their side by including four Oxford men,\\" it said. Three of the four were certainly Kenneth Blaikie, Louis Wharton and John Frazer ‚Äì the first two went on to play other matches for Somerset, but Frazer's county cricket was otherwise for Sussex. It is not clear who the fourth was, but as all the other players in the Oxford match had played before for Somerset, Wisden could have meant Fairbanks-Smith. Either way, he batted at No 10, made 0 and 6, took one catch and did not bowl. Alone of the four Oxford conscripts, Fairbanks-Smith accompanied the Somerset side on to Cambridge, where he was 0 not out at the end of the Somerset first innings and then \\"absent\\" in the second innings.Cricket Archive has Fairbanks-Smith as \\"absent hurt\\" in the second innings, but there is no record of any injury and given Somerset's difficulty in raising a side that week he may simply have had to leave before the end of the match.

It was founded in 2005 by CEO Matthew Corrin, and has since expanded to over 100 locations in countries including Canada, the United States, Colombia, Peru, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, and United Arab Emirates, with franchises under development in Germany, Guatemala, and Saudi Arabia. As of January 2018, Freshii has 370 locations in North America, South America, and Europe. By the end of 2019, the company expected to have 760 locations worldwide In November 2018, that number was reduced substantially. History Freshii was founded by Matthew Corrin in Toronto, in 2005. At the time, Matthew Corrin was working under fashion designer Oscar de la Renta when he became inspired by New York delis that offered fresh food. Originally called \\"Lettuce Eatery\\", the store opened to large queues and ran out of food on the first day before the end of lunch. In 2016, the company opened an average of 3.5 new stores per week and reached a total of 220 stores in 20 countries. Rapid expansion has also been seen in Latin America, with Colombia serving as the base of operations. As of 2015, Freshii hopes to open from 13 to 20 restaurants in Chile over the next decade. Restaurants have also been opening in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Panama. The Latin American locations all feature the same core menu as Freshii outlets in North America and Europe, but also add several local or domestic ingredients. As of 2017, they're also planning on expanding into the U.K. market, as Freshii CEO and founder Matthew Corrin said in a statement that the United Kingdom is underserved when it comes to healthy fast-casual food offerings and the company believes there is tremendous opportunity to grow the brand in the region. In 2016, the chain introduced meal boxes at most locations which include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks. The boxes are available in plans ranging from 1 to 30 days and focus on healthy eating. In February 2019, Freshii announced plans to begin selling their pre-packaged meals inside of Walmart Canada stores. Freshii‚Äôs business activity is supervised by a seven- member board of directors that is chaired by Matthew Corrin. Board members include Adam Corrin (COO), as well as Michele Romanow, Marc Kielburger, Jeffrey John Burchell, Heather Briant, Neil Pasricha, William Schultz, and Paul Hughes Philanthropy Freshii is an active supporter of many local organizations where they have operating locations. Globally, Freshii is an active supporter of WE Charity and meals are donated to children in need when certain meals are purchased by customers.

It was the first single released from their 1991 \\"reunion\\" album Union. It reached the number- one spot on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart in May 1991, and stayed at the top for six weeks. It also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, their last single to do so.  Background  Following Yes's 1987‚Äì88 tour to support the Big Generator album, singer Jon Anderson left the band and formed a new group with 1970s-era Yes members Steve Howe (guitars), Rick Wakeman (keyboards) and Bill Bruford (drums). As their new band Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, the quartet released a self-titled album and went on tour. Meanwhile, the remaining members of the \\"official\\" Yes, guitarist Trevor Rabin, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Alan White and keyboardist Tony Kaye, continued work on a follow-up to Big Generator. Among the songs recorded was the Rabin- and Squire-penned \\"Lift Me Up\\", the lyrics of which allude to homelessness: The two competing bands had fought for the rights to use the \\"Yes\\" name, with the Squire/Rabin/White/Kaye faction filing suit to prevent Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe from using the name \\"Yes\\" during their tour promotion. However, once both factions were signed to Arista Records, the record label decided to combine the musicians' efforts and produce an album, Union, featuring songs from each group. \\"Lift Me Up\\" was one of four Rabin or Squire songs included on the album; its follow-up single, \\"Saving My Heart\\", was another.  Chart performance  \\"Lift Me Up\\" was Yes's third (and as of , last) single to reach number one on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart, following 1983's \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\" from 90125 and 1987's \\"Love Will Find a Way\\" from Big Generator. \\"Lift Me Up\\" spent six weeks at the number one spot, from May 4 to June 8, 1991.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 13. Geography Lindy is in northeastern Knox County, south of the Missouri River and the South Dakota border. Nebraska Highway 12 forms the southern edge of the community; the highway leads east to Crofton and west to Niobrara. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Lindy CDP has an area of , all land. The community is in the valley of Hoboe Creek, a southwest-flowing tributary of Howe Creek, which in turn flows west to Bazile Creek, a north-flowing tributary of the Missouri River. History Lindy was established late in the state's history. The townsite was surveyed in 1928, in response to demand for a local marketing and shopping center. Development was further encouraged by a rumor, which later proved unfounded, suggesting that a railroad line might be built through the area. The new town was named after Charles Lindbergh, nicknamed \\"Lucky Lindy\\", who the year before had made his celebrated non-stop solo flight from New York to Paris. During its heyday, Lindy had a number of businesses, including a hardware store, a barbershop, an ice-cream parlor, a blacksmith shop, and an electrical-appliances shop. It also boasted a large hall with a full basement for a garage, a dance hall and movie theater on the second floor, and office and living space on the third. This building was dismantled in 1944. From 1944 to 1958, the local Addison Telephone Company operated out of Lindy. In later years, Lindy's population declined and its businesses closed. In 1978, it had a population of 38. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the town's feed store, general store, and gas pumps were shut down or moved away. By 2002, there were 13 residents. Lindy today Lindy is an unincorporated community. It is home to one commercial enterprise, the Lindy Country Club restaurant and bar; to a single church, the Good Shepherd Evangelical Lutheran Church; and to a fire hall, operated by the Bloomfield Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Unit. Lindy is located on Nebraska Highway 12. It is within the Santee Sioux Reservation. In 2001, a number of northeastern Nebraska communities formed Shannon Trail Promoters, with the goal of increasing tourism in the forthcoming bicentennial year of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The organization commissioned thirteen wooden chainsaw sculptures of Private George Shannon, a member of the expedition who became separated from the group in August 1804 and wandered lost for 16 days before rediscovering the party. These statues were placed in participating communities along a Shannon Trail. Sixteen wayside markers recounting aspects of Shannon's career were also installed along the trail, which runs through the region in which Shannon is thought to have traveled while trying to find and rejoin the expedition. A statue and a marker were placed in Lindy, beside the country club.

On 2 February 1966 the helicopter operating the flight crashed near Fardipur after an oil leak developed and the main gearbox failed. Twenty passengers and all three crew were killed; one passenger survived. Accident The S-61, registered AP-AOC, left Dacca at 14:03 local time on 2 February 1966 and within 15 minutes an oil leak had started from a pipe connected to the main gearbox. The flight continued and while the helicopter was at an altitude of 500 feet (152 m) crossing the Padma River the sole survivor noticed that the oil leak was visible in the passenger cabin. About 3.5 miles (5.6 km) from Faridpur heliport, a bird strike occurred, with a vulture hitting one of the rotor blades on the left side of the helicopter. The helicopter continued normally and the pilot lowered its landing gear at an altitude of 300 feet (91 m) in preparation for the scheduled landing at Faridpur. Although both engines were running the helicopter experienced a loss of power to the main transmission; the pilot corrected the resulting turn to the left, then the helicopter continued rolling and rocking in a steep uncontrolled descent into the ground at 14:23. Probable cause The accident was attributed to the disengagement of the left and right spur gear teeth in the main transmission, caused by the load imposed by the failure of the gearbox's rear sleeve bearing journals. The rear sleeve bearing failure was caused by an oil leak although evidence was destroyed by fire and the source of the leak was not established.

Located on the shore of Wrangell, Alaska barely a mile out of town, it became a State Historic Park in 2000. At least 40 petroglyphs have been found to date.Wrangell, Alaska, Petroglyph Beach. The site itself is about 8000 years old. The petroglyphs that remain here are found on the boulders and bedrock outcrops on the shore, just below and above mean high tide. It is thought that they were created by members of the Tlingit tribe and most of the petroglyphs can be found close to places of importance such as salmon streams and sites of habitation. They depict whales, salmon, and faces of the community. The rock here is metamorphic and tends to be a dark gray that is finely grained, moderately durable, and easy to fracture, which would make it easier to manipulate for petroglyphs. Here are some of the most concentrated petroglyphs in the world. Petroglyphs and associated site components are under the protection of federal laws and State of Alaska Antiquities Laws.The Antiquities Act: A Century of American Archaeology, Historic Preservation, and Nature Conservation, Antiquities Laws. Petroglyphs may be a form of writing, a method of communication, or a way to record events and there are many interpretations of them including commemorating victories in war; documenting the transfer of wealth or territory in settlement of a feud; important potlatches; shamanistic exploits, etc. They may also have a religious significance as well; by using petroglyphs as a ritual device to assure success of the hunt and to increase the supply of game, but they may simply have no meaning beyond their artistic conception. Furthermore, petroglyphs are created by removing part of a rock surface by incising, pecking, carving or abrading. Unfortunately the petroglyphs are typically not used by professional archaeologists. They usually avoid petroglyphs because they are very difficult to date and any interpretation is usually unscientific and very speculative.Snow, Dean. Archaeology of Native North America.

King Middle School In 1954, Houston real estate investor Cortes Ewing King donated a 54-acre tract to the Sheldon Independent School District. The district used the donated land to construct a Junior-Senior High School and named it after him. C.E. King Junior-Senior High School was located on the western half of the donated land where C.E. King Middle School currently stands. The school was partially destroyed by fire in 1955, and in the same year, C.E. King Junior-Senior High School had its first graduating class of 11 students. In 1965, the Junior-Senior High School was renamed C.E. King Junior High School and a new C.E. King High School building on 8540 C.E. King Parkway opened on the land adjacent to it. In 1972, the former Parkway Elementary opened next to the high school on 10 acres donated to the district by the Parkway Subdivision. That campus later closed and was annexed as part of the high school. A building addition to C.E. King High School was completed in 1970. The auditorium was added in 1973. Classroom additions were made to the main building and the annex in 1978. The gym, field house, and wellness center were added in the late 1980s early 1990s. An administrative addition was completed in 1999. A two-story building near the tennis courts was completed in 2002. In 2003 the plaza and new cafeteria were opened.

King JROTC at the 2013 Martin Luther King Day Parade in Midtown Houston Academies The school is organized into five academies to allow for a more personalized attention to students by creating a smaller learning environment. This is based after the house system of smaller learning communities. In this system, each student is assigned to an academy in which they will work with an Assistant Principal-Counselor pair for all four years at the school. The district believes this model will make a large school feel smaller as well as help students choose a career in the fields they are interested in. * Achieve Academy * Excel Academy * Triumph Academy * Victory Academy References and footnotesExternal links * Cyril E.

At that time, it was called the Nurses Association of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (NAACOG). AWHONN became a separate and independent organization in 1993.Nurse Zone Using the Association of Women‚Äôs Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) guidelines correctly can make staffing the safest possible. When these staffing guidelines are followed appropriately they allow for quality care and more time for the nurse to spend at the bedside with the patient. The experience and skill mix of the nurses on the labor and delivery unit is another critical element of safe staffing. Nurses in labor and delivery units should have one patient to care for if the woman is having her labor induced or has chosen a birthing plan without pain medication or an epidural. Two nurses should be at every birth, one to care for the mom and the other to care for the baby. As far as post partum and mother baby units, the ratio is one nurse for every 3-4 couplets (mom and a baby) as long as they are all considered ‚Äústable‚Äù. Sections and Chapters There are 51 AWHONN Sections (one for each state, plus one that represents members in the US Armed Forces). Within each section, there are local chapters. Activities=Standards and Guidelines AWHONN publishes Standards for Professional Nursing Practice in the Care of Women and Newborns. These standards define the roles, functions and competencies of nurses caring for women and newborns and delineate the various roles and behaviors for which the professional nurse is accountable.

The granite church stands near the middle of Dartmoor, above sea level in an exposed location close to Dartmoor Prison. Permission for the construction of the church was given 1812 by the Lord Commissioners of the Admiralty. The church was designed by the architect Daniel Alexander and built by prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars and finished by those captured during the American war who were held in the prison, and is the only church in England to have been built by prisoners of war. The three stage west tower is surmounted by pinnacles. Prisoners of war were held in the prison until 1816 and then the church closed. It was reopened and reconsecrated in 1831. In 1868 the chancel was altered and between 1898 and 1901 further alterations and expansion were undertaken under the direction of Edmund Sedding. In 1915 the tower was restored. The east window has stained glass by Mayer of Munich, which was installed in 1910 in memory of the American prisoners who helped to build the church. The graves of many prisoners are in the churchyard. The window was partially funded by a donation of ¬£250, in 1908, from the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution of 1812 as part of their work commemorating those who died in the War of 1812.

It is fourth of the five pieces in the suite Water Scenes. The composer recalled the Greek myth of Narcissus and, upon rereading the story, the music came quickly. The first draft was written immediately and was revised after a break for dinner. It was then sent for publication as the composer was so confident in the work that he did not play it until receiving the proofs. When published, it was a great success, selling over 125,000 copies of sheet music and has been a musical standard ever since. It has a simple, sweet structure which flows easily and so is a standard piece used in piano teaching. The piece was used for a light comical duet which was recorded by Sir Norman Wisdom and Joyce Grenfell in 1952. This is also known as The Laughing Song. It also appears (with a short conversation following) as a track on Gorilla, the 1967 debut album of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, and features in the queue for the Spirit of London dark ride at Madame Tussauds in London.

It was written by co-executive producer Lawrence Konner and supervising producer Margaret Nagle and directed by Jeremy Podeswa. The episode received generally favourable reviews from television critics. The episode centres on Nucky celebrating his birthday and Jimmy getting settled into his new home, Chicago. The title of the episode comes from a contemporary news story when Anna Anderson, a Polish factory worker, surfaced claiming to be the lost Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia, creating a sensation in March, 1922.  Plot  In Chicago, Jimmy finds himself working for Torrio, and lives in a brothel Torrio runs. Jimmy and Capone attempt to strongarm a bar owner to buy his liquor from Torrio; when he is uncooperative, Capone beats him. They meet with Torrio's rival, Sheridan, and compromise on business arrangements. Torrio is more impressed by Jimmy's negotiation than by Capone's brutality. One of Sheridan's men retaliates, attacking and disfiguring Jimmy's current girlfriend Pearl, a prostitute in Torrio's brothel. In Atlantic City, as Nucky plans his \\"surprise\\" birthday party, he worries about the political impact of the murder of Chalky's driver. Eli delivers the leader of the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan to Chalky, who tortures him until he is satisfied that the Klan was not involved in the killing. At Nucky's party, Senator Walter Evans Edge tells him he will not receive the expected roadbuilding funds needed to complete Atlantic City's development, which will go instead to Mayor Frank Hague in Jersey City. Luciano finds Jimmy's mother Gillian at his house, and tells her he is looking for \\"James\\". She sees through his cover story and throws him out. Luciano follows her around for several days; she spots him, and initiates a physical relationship. Margaret goes to work and is directed to deliver a dress to Lucy at Nucky's party. She becomes elated when Nucky asks her to dance. After returning to the shop, Margaret sees Nucky and Lucy heading for a night on the town. Upset, she then steals a dress from \\"Belle Femme\\" and goes home.  Reception = Critical reception  The episode received positive reviews from critics. IGN gave the episode their highest rating up to that point with an 8.5 and said \\"It's amazing that the writers found a way to commit so much good storytelling into one hour of television.\\" They also said \\"\\"Anastasia\\", Boardwalk's fourth episode, is so far its best, turning its criminals into sympathetic characters despite their vices and secrets, and doing so without resorting to forced or saccharine ways.\\" TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5/5.0 and enjoyed the transformation of Margaret. \\"My favorite moment of the night was Margaret's brilliant transformation into a well-spoken and intelligent character. Her change from a quiet wallflower with small ambitions came at the best time, during Nucky's party. As the Commodore repeated his enraging \\"test\\" of female intelligence and political acumen on Lucy (\\"You're assuming they have minds at all\\"), Margaret voices an informed opinion about Women's Suffrage by stating, \\"In most civilized countries, women are afforded that privilege.\\"http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/10/boardwalk- empire-review-anastasia/  Ratings  The episode plunged to a 1.1 adults 18‚Äì49 rating this week from a 1.4 the week before, and lost over 800,000 average viewers from the week before.

Life Anna was raised in the Lutheran faith in Mecklenburg, where the reformation had recently been introduced. She married the Duke of Courland, Gotthard Kettler, on 11 March 1566 in K√∂nigsberg. Her marriage was very late for a princess of her period. The marriage was initiated in 1564, and the alliance between Courland and Mecklenburg brought both wealth and important foreign connections to Germany to the recently founded Duchy of Courland. Anna and Gotthard lived with their household in Riga from their wedding until 1578, when the first Ducal Palace of Mitau was ready to live in. Anna of Mecklenburg was described as a well educated cultural patron, who is credited for having played an important role in the development of art in the new state of Courland. In this role, she is credited with having commissioned the art of local churches from local artists rather than foreign artists, which had been the normal in Courland. She is also credited with having organized the first Ducal court. She corresponded with her relatives in Germany, maintaining foreign diplomatic connections to the Duchy. She was widowed in 1587.

Originally established to provide pilot and technicians for Spartan Aircraft Company, it outlived its parent company and continues to train pilots and mechanics into the 21st Century. The main campus is adjacent to Tulsa International Airport, with another campus used for flight training at Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport. In May, 2014 Spartan acquired the Crimson Technical College located in Inglewood, California. Crimson Technical College was founded in 1930, originally called The California Flyers, Inc. and eventually became the Northrop University. On March 31, 2015, this campus took on the Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology name and added a branch located in Riverside, CA. In April 2016, Spartan also acquired Redstone College in Broomfield, Colorado. Redstone College took the Spartan College name in March 2017. Spartan offers an Aviation Maintenance Technology (AMT) hybrid program leading to an AMT AS degree and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airframe and Powerplant (A&P;) certification. This program, jointly developed with C-T-S.com, is the first of its kind to be approved by the FAA. History William G. Skelly, a Tulsa oilman and owner of Spartan Aircraft Company, founded the Spartan School in 1928. Initially, the purpose of the school was to promote sales of aircraft manufactured by the company. The school was located initially across Apache Street from Tulsa International Airport. During the early 1930s, Skelly pledged his share of Spartan Aircraft Company as collateral for a loan from J. Paul Getty, but Skelly's finances became overextended during the Great Depression. As a result, Getty obtained control of Spartan Aircraft, including the Spartan School in 1935. In 1942, Getty personally took over management of Spartan Aircraft and its school. The Spartan School was activated as a U. S. Army Air Corps (USAAC) facility on August 1, 1939 as an advanced civilian pilot training school to supplement the Air Corps' few flying training schools. The Air Corps supplied students with training aircraft, flying clothes, textbooks, and equipment. The Air Corps also put a detachment at each school to supervise training. Flying training was performed with Fairchild PT-19s as the primary trainer. The Air Force also supplied several PT-17 Stearmans and a few P-40 Warhawks. Spartan furnished instructors, training sites and facilities, aircraft maintenance, quarters, and mess halls. Students from the Royal Air Force entered the school on June 7, 1941. The U. S. Army Air Force officially designated Spartan as a British Refresher School. In 1943, the school reorganized into a College of Aeronautical Engineering, School of Flight, School of Mechanics, School of Meteorology, School of Communications and School of Instruments. In November 1943, the school was selected by the Department of State and the Civil Aeronautics Administration as a training facility for the Inter-American Aviation Mechanic Training program. The first class under this program included 67 students from 12 Latin American countries. Spartan Aircraft Company reorganized after World War II, renaming itself as Spartan Aero Repair in 1946. It ceased to produce aircraft, though it continued to operate the school. For the next 15 years the parent company made Spartan Trailers instead of aircraft. It closed the Tulsa manufacturing plant in 1961, and renamed Minnehoma Insurance Company. The Spartan tradename was sold to the Spartan School. In 1967, the former Spartan interests were bought by Automation Industries, Inc., who sold them to National Education Corporation, the parent company of National Education Center, Inc. in 1972. In 1997, National Education Corporation became a subsidiary of Harcourt General Corporation. In 2004, Spartan School of Aeronautics changed its name to Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology to represent its current offering of college degree programs and technology diversity. Spartan Aviation Industries, Inc. was formed in 2005 by Spartan's management team and was purchased from Harcourt General Corporation. In 2013 Spartan Education Industries Inc, was formed and acquired the college from Spartan Aviation Industries, Inc. In 2014 Spartan acquired the Crimson Technical Institute, an Airframe and Powerplant focused college located in Inglewood, California. The Crimson Technical College was founded in 1930 as The California Flyers Inc. and eventually became Northrop University and then Northrop Rice Aviation Institute of Technology (NRAIT). On March 31, 2015 Crimson Technical College became an additional campus location of Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology. In April 2016, Spartan College acquired Redstone College in Broomfield, Colorado.  Locations  Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology has a total of five locations.

Satan is depicted meeting with key members of the British government. The poem was modelled on and meant as a continuation of \\"The Devil's Thoughts\\" of 1799 by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey.Chewning, Harris, 1955, pp. 81‚Äì96 The work is important in Shelley's development and evolution of writings that castigate and criticise the British government to achieve political and economic reform. Background The poem was written in 1812 by Shelley to protest the actions of the British government and harsh economic conditions in the country at the time. The poem emerged after the food riots in Devon where Shelley lived at that time. Prices for grain were at their highest level in 1812, there were shortages of food, and prices were inflated.Gilmour, Ian. The Making of the Poets: Byron and Shelley in Their Time.

He went to London where he discussed religion and scandals with a friend. He went to St. James‚Äôs Court and St. Paul‚Äôs Church.

Research Previous research into High Speed Rail (HSR) has tended to focus on the international spatial level. Greengauge is one of a number of groups now using a multilevel (regional, national and international) analysis to satisfactorily understand HSR‚Äôs territorial implications. Greengauge 21 has shown that while capacity on the new line (HS2) is expected to be fully used soon enough (certainly within 20 years of opening), there is plenty of scope and a good business case for a second north‚Äìsouth high-speed line. In February 2010, Greengauge 21 contracted KPMG, one of the big four auditing firms, to conduct a study into the economic benefits of a high-speed rail network. The findings of this research were published in the report \\"Consequences for employment and economic growth\\". Greengauge 21 research has found that the price of travel on a future domestic High Speed network will be comparable with fares on conventional trains. A new report says that many passengers could be paying no more than ¬£20 and dismisses claims that high-speed rail will be the preserve of a wealthy elite. Many of Greengauge 21's recommendations have been incorporated into the planning of High Speed 2, a high-speed rail line, which will link London to Birmingham, with possible future phases extending the line to the North of England and Scotland.

It includes at least the pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus), Van Gelder's bat (Bauerus dubiaquercus), and the fossil Anzanycteris; some classifications also include the genera Rhogeessa and Baeodon. Taxonomy The pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) was first described in 1856 and first placed in its own genus, Antrozous, in 1862. Several suggestions were made early on about its relationships, including that of Wilhelm Peters in 1865, who placed it in the family Vespertilionidae and considered it to be related to the Australian Nyctophilus. Others suggested a relationship with the vespertilionid genus Plecotus or the Phyllostomidae. In 1897, Gerrit S. Miller described a subfamily Antrozoinae for the pallid bat,Miller, 1897, p. 41 but ten years later chose to place Nyctophilus and Antrozous together in a subfamily Nyctophilinae.Miller, 1907, pp. 234‚Äì235 Van Gelder's bat was described in 1959 as Antrozous (Bauerus) dubiaquercus; subsequently, the species has been placed in its own genus, Bauerus, while others have retained it in Antrozous with its close relative, the pallid bat, with the current consensus being toward placing them in separate genera.Simmons, 2005, pp. 498‚Äì499 In 1970, Karl F. Koopman and J. Knox Jones recognized a tribe Antrozoini (comprising only Antrozous and Bauerus), which they still placed within Nyctophilinae. In a separate 1970 paper, however, Koopman questioned the affinities between the North American antrozoines and the Australasian Nyctophilus on the basis of biogeography.Roehrs et al., 2010, p. 1081 The next year, Ronald Pine and colleagues further questioned this relationship on the basis of baculum (penis bone) characters, although they cautioned that more penes of Bauerus needed to be studied.Pine et al., 1971, p. 668 Since then, Antrozoini has generally been considered a valid tribe in the subfamily Vespertilioninae, which includes most members of Vespertilionidae. In 1998, Nancy B. Simmons argued that Antrozoini was not, in fact, closely related to other Vespertilioninae and instead placed the two species in their own family, Antrozoidae, which she considered closer to the Molossidae, another family of bats. However, this hypothesis was later refuted by DNA sequence data, which indicated that the Antrozoini nested within Vespertilioninae.Hoofer and Van Den Bussche, 2001, fig. 1; 2003, p. 28 Therefore, Simmons placed the two species in Vespertilionidae in the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World, but she kept them as a subfamily separate from Vespertilioninae, called Antrozoinae, because of continued phylogenetic uncertainty.Simmons, 2005, p. 498 However all DNA studies place antrozoines in Vespertilioninae, and this led Steven Hoofer and Ronald Van Den Bussche (2003) as well as Zachary Roehrs and colleagues (2010) to classify them as a tribe, Antrozoini, within that subfamily.Hoofer and Van Den Bussche, 2003, table 6; Roehrs et al., 2010, p. 1081, fig. 4 Hoofer and Van Den Bussche, who used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences in their study, also expanded Antrozoini to include the American genera Rhogeessa and Baeodon (which are often combined as Rhogeessa). These genera were previously placed in the tribe Nycticeiini and considered to be related to the Old World genus Otonycteris.Hoofer and Van Den Bussche, 2003, p. 28 In their 2010 paper, Roehrs and colleagues again found that mtDNA sequences supported a relationship between Antrozous, Bauerus, Rhogeessa, and Baeodon, but what limited nuclear DNA data for Baeodon they had suggested that the genus may be more closely related to Lasiurus. Distribution and fossil record The pallid bat occurs in northern Mexico, the western United States (east to Kansas and Texas), and marginally southwestern Canada (British Columbia).Simmons, 2005, p. 498; Kays and Wilson, 2000, p. 146 It is also found on Cuba; the population there has been classified as a separate species, Antrozous koopmani, by some authorities, but it is now included in the pallid bat.Czaplewski, 1993, p. 380; Simmons, 2005, pp. 498‚Äì499 Van Gelder's bat is found from Nayarit in western Mexico south and east to Costa Rica.Simmons, 2005, p. 499 Most species of Rhogeessa occur in Mexico, but several occur further south, reaching to Bolivia and Brazil.Simmons, 2005, pp. 462‚Äì463 The single species of Baeodon, B. alleni, is restricted to Mexico.Simmons, 2005, p. 462 The oldest fossils identified as Antrozous come from the Barstovian (Middle Miocene) of Nebraska; however, their attribution to the genus is tentative. Undoubted Antrozous come from the Hemphillian (Late Miocene) of Texas and additional fossils are from the Pliocene of Texas, Idaho, and Florida.Czaplewski, 1993 No fossils of Bauerus or Baeodon are known; the only fossils of Rhogeessa come from the Pleistocene of Inciarte in Venezuela.McKenna and Bell, 1997, p. 321; Czaplewski et al., 2005, pp. 773‚Äì776 In 1969, John A. White named the genus Anzanycteris on the basis of Pliocene fossils from California (originally identified as Pleistocene) and included it in Nyctophilinae. Later, Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell listed Anzanycteris under Antrozoini in their 1997 Classification of Mammals.White, 1969; McKenna and Bell, 1997, p. 322 ReferencesLiterature cited *Czaplewski, N.J. 1993.

It is the administrative center of Veselynove Raion. Population: History Veselynove was settled in the end of the 18th century and got its name from the landowner Veselinov. Since the beginning of the 19th century, it belonged to Kherson Governorate, after 1834 to Ananyevsky Uyezd. In January 1918, Veselynove became a center of a volost. On 16 April 1920, Odessa Governorate split off, and the area was moved to Voznesensky Uyezd of Odessa Governorate. In 1923, uyezds in Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic were abolished, and the governorates were divided into okruhas. In 1930, okruhas were abolished, and on 27 February 1932, Odessa Oblast was established, and Veselynove was included into Odessa Oblast. Veselynove Raion with the administrative center in Veselynove was established in 1939 and belonged to Odessa Oblast. In 1944, Veselynove Raion was transferred to Mykolaiv Oblast. In 1960, Veselynove was granted urban-type settlement status. In 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, the raion was abolished. In 1965, it was re-established.

The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle this growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car. Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making by the central authorities. The demand for transport infrastructure and services was rising, but the Soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet the growing demand of the people. The underdeveloped Soviet road network, in a chain reaction, led to a growing demand for public transport. The nation's merchant fleet was one of the largest in the world. Civil aviation Area in front of airport building, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, 1974. The Ministry of Civil Aviation was, according to the Air Code of the USSR, responsible for all air transport enterprises and airlines established by it. Soviet civil air transport was the largest by total destinations and vehicles during most of its post-war existence. In the USSR, Aeroflot had a monopoly on all air transport. This ranged from civil and cargo transport to transporting political prisoners to the gulags, and more. The Soviet Union covered over one sixth of the entire earth's landmass, and in the early 1920s its government decided to invest in the aviation industry. They concluded that expanding it in the Soviet Union would not only make travel more efficient and faster, it would also help build and develop the mostly farmland, enormously spread out nation that it was. At this time, most travel required taking trains (or, as was often the case, by off-road travel in cars, buses, or trucks).Matthew Sagers and Thomas Maraffa, \\"Soviet Air-Passenger Transportation Network,\\" Geographical Review 80 (1990): 266-267 Many of the northern and eastern territories in the Soviet Union were completely inaccessible during much of the year; most of these vast expanses of land lacked roads and railroads because of the huge distances between them and the nearest population centers. The practically uninhabitable weather also made travel and construction nearly impossible.Sagers and Maraffa, \\"Soviet Air-Passenger Transportation Network,\\" 267 The absence of \\"surface transportation facilities\\" also meant that very little equipment was available to use for road construction‚Äîmaking the process even more daunting. Consequently, the Soviet government concluded that building a series of airports scattered throughout the more isolated parts of the country would be far more economically efficient than to build thousands of miles of road and railways. The Soviet Government decided, therefore, that air travel would be the best means of transportation for people and cargo. First, a fleet was necessary; between 1928 and 1932, the number of aircraft manufacturing facilities grew from twelve to thirty-one, while the nation's annual output of airplanes increased from a mere 608 to 2,509.Scott Palmer, Dictatorship of the Air - Aviation Culture and the Fate of Modern Russia (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 197. After combining a number of existing fleets, the Soviet government founded the national airline and air service of the Soviet Union, renaming the \\"USSR Civil Air Fleet\\" Aeroflot.Sagers and Maraffa, \\"Soviet Air-Passenger Transportation Network,\\" 266; \\"Chronicle of Events: 1930-1939\\" http://www.aeroflot.ru/cms/en/about/history_30-39 Aeroflot, at its formation in March 1932, had three main purposes. They were: to operate and maintain an air transportation system, to provide different types of services (such as aerial surveying, forest-fire fighting, and agricultural spraying) and to promote educational, recreational, athletic and other such activities for the public.\\"Early Soviet Civil Aviation,\\" Century of Flight: Airlines and Airliners, http://www.century-of- flight.net/new%20site/commercial/Soviet%20civil%20aviation.htm Aeroflot, which literally translates to or air fleet, originally consisted of an amalgam of existing air transportation fleets in the Soviet Union in the 1920s. By creating Aeroflot, the Soviet government was, much like many industries in the young Soviet Union at the time, expanding and centralizing fleets like the \\"Red Air Fleet.\\" To the general public, the aviation industry did not represent modernization; rather, it represented the means to achieve modernization and future glory.Scott Palmer, Dictatorship of the Air, 101. During Joseph Stalin's Second Five-Year Plan (1933-1938), the Communist Party Congress (and Stalin himself) devised the development and further expansion of the aviation industry, soon making air transport one of the primary means of transportation in the Soviet Union.Scott Palmer, Dictatorship of the Air, 224-8 Their strategy involved creating a network of cities and towns to deliver people, whether they were politicians, military officials, prisoners or travelers, and, most importantly, mail and freight. Stalin also recognized that with a strong civil aviation sector he could supply necessary equipment and materials to prisoners in the Gulag, increasing their efficiency and production output.Boyne, Walter J. (2002). Air warfare: an international encyclopedia 1.ABC-CLIO. p. 8. By 1933, Soviet aviation delegations and engineers, some for as long as six months at a time, were regular visitors at the most prominent American aircraft developers, such as Boeing, Douglas, Pratt & Whitney, and Curtiss-Wright (to name only a few).Palmer Dictatorship of the Air, 199. These engineers would play a key role in the origins of Soviet aircraft manufacturer, Ilyushin.Palmer, Dictatorship of the Air, 199-200 For much of the Soviet Union's existence, air travel served to deliver freight. In the 1930s, freight made up 85 percent of Aeroflot's services.\\"Early Soviet Civil Aviation,\\" http://www.century-of- flight.net/new%20site/commercial/Soviet%20civil%20aviation.htm In fact, at this time, air travel in the Soviet Union existed as less of a means to travel, but rather a way for the government to develop remote areas of the nation for industrialization needs and resource acquisition. The public rarely flew as flights were often very expensive (350 rubles‚Äîmaybe half of a workers' monthly salary) and service was poor. Aeroflot, as the single state owned and governed airline, operated without any competitors and expanded according to the Soviet central government and central planning.Sagers and Maraffa, \\"Soviet Air-Passenger Transportation Network,\\" 271 By the beginning of World War II, Aeroflot, and the entirety of the Soviet civil aviation industry, was primarily a domestic freight carrier. In fact, in 1939, they surpassed the U.S. in volume of airfreight. Despite Stalin's strong xenophobia, Aeroflot commenced its first international route in 1936, operating between Moscow and Prague. After World War II, the Soviet government wanted to continue expansion by starting and increasing services from Moscow to the capitals of other Soviet republics. The ever-growing Soviet air transportation network began to shrink the railroad's importance in Soviet nations. As years passed, the Soviet regime recognized the aviation industry's increasing value, and officials in transportation planning attempted to establish regular air service to nearly every city in the union. By 1968, after Soviet engineers helped pioneer the introduction of jets and the jet age, Aeroflot and its subsidiaries served roughly 3,500 cities.Sagers and Maraffa, \\"Soviet Air- Passenger Transportation Network,\\" 267-8 At that time, \\"the thirty largest Soviet cities were connected with all cities with a population of 500,000 or more\\" (including nearly 80 percent of those with populations from 100,000 to 499,999, and 60 percent of the cities with 50,000 to 99,999 people).Sagers and Maraffa, \\"Soviet Air-Passenger Transportation Network,\\" 268 By joining these cities, infrastructure and industry benefitted heavily. The jet age and the introduction of new, faster, and more reliable ways of air travel greatly changed Soviet aviation. Jets not only further shortened travel times; they allowed nonstop service between cities that had been otherwise out of reach for nonstop flights. In the early 1960s prior to the jet age, the longest nonstop service from Moscow was Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) (roughly ); by the 1980s, mail could be delivered from Moscow to Vladivostok, nearly to the east, the same day. The Soviet Union put the first jet in the world into service in 1956 on a Moscow to Irkutsk route of some using a Soviet built Tupolev Tu-104.\\"Aeroflot History\\" http://www.aeroflot.ru/cms/en/about/history; Sagers and Maraffa, \\"Soviet Air-Passenger Transportation Network,\\" 267 The Soviet government established a \\"hubbing\\" system unlike the West; in the Soviet Union, most cities had a direct link with Moscow. In the United States and Europe, most small cities were and are presently connected to larger cities and their airports; airlines then use these larger airports‚Äîor \\"hubs\\"‚Äîto connect passengers to their flight and onto their destination.Sagers and Maraffa, \\"Soviet Air-Passenger Transportation Network,\\" 273 Because the Soviet Union essentially revolved around Moscow, this networking technique proved effective. By the early 1980s, Aeroflot had experienced massive growth in the aviation market. They carried 116.1 million passengers and millions of pounds of cargo.\\"Soviet Union: Aeroflot Operations,\\" Library of Congress Country Studies, May 1989. http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0388%29 Still, because of travel restrictions, only 3.4 million passengers were international travelers. The airline remained an almost entirely domestic carrier, getting freight and people to far off remote cities, many of which had been built by Stalin-era Gulag prisoners. Aeroflot also remained in charge of other non-delivery or transportation services such as: \\"ice patrol in the Arctic Ocean and escorting of ships through frozen seas, oil exploration, power line surveillance, and transportation and heavy lifting support on construction projects.\\" Further, because nearly every single non-military airplane permitted to fly in the Soviet Union was registered as an Aeroflot airframe, Aeroflot suffered from the worst safety reputation in the worldwide industry, recording between four hundred and five hundred incidents since its creation in 1932. Many blamed Ilyushin and their engineers for the airplanes' poorer reliability when compared to its Western counterparts‚Äînamely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. By the mid-to-late 1980s, Aeroflot's domestic flights were noted consistently as \\"harrowing\\" experiences for both Western and Soviet passengers. At the airport, passengers complained of long waits, poor and indifferent service at ticket offices, poorly designed and set up waiting areas at airport terminals, along with inadequate food and toilet facilities. On board, passengers complained of being forced to sit in \\"hot airplane cabins without air conditioning\\" and \\"indifferent\\" cabin crews. Air traffic in Russia, 1970-2015 By the time Mikhail Gorbachev introduced perestroika and its reforms in the mid-1980s, permitting free speech and pluralism, Aeroflot had shown considerable growth. In 1950, air transportation only accounted for 1.2 percent of the total passenger transportation turnover in the Soviet Union, yet, by 1987, air travel accounted for 18.7 of that. It continues growing today.Sagers and Maraffa, \\"Soviet Air-Passenger Transportation Network,\\" 266 After the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, Boris Yeltsin ushered in a new, free market economy. Foreign airlines were permitted to land in Russia and Aeroflot split into several sectors, including today's airline that bears the same name. It became a privatized company, and soon other airlines found their way into the Russian spotlight.\\"Aeroflot History\\" http://www.aeroflot.ru/cms/en/about/history Transaero Airlines and S7 (Sibir) Airlines commenced operations in mid-1992.\\"Transaero Airlines\\" http://www.transaero.com/ ; \\"S7 Airlines\\" http://www.s7.ru/en/ In 1993, Transaero became the first Russian aircraft operator to receive Boeing airplanes.\\"Transaero History\\" http://transaero.ru/en/company/history Transaero only operated three Russian built Tu-124 airplanes, the rest of their fleet consists of only the Boeing (747, 777, 767)‚Äîmodernizing and Westernizing Russian aviation.\\"Our Fleet\\" S7, though originally operating more Soviet- built airplanes, currently fly only Airbus and Boeing types.\\"Our Fleet\\" http://www.s7.ru/home/about/ourfleet.dot#.UYbkjyvwLC4 Aeroflot, too, followed suit. Beginning in 1994, Aeroflot began taking deliveries of Western Airplanes. Aeroflot uses its Airbus and Boeing fleet primarily on Western routes to encourage Western passenger travel. In 2006, Aeroflot joined the global airline alliance SkyTeam,\\"Chronicle of Events: 2006\\" http://www.aeroflot.ru/cms/en/about/history_2006 and in 2010, S7 joined a different global alliance, OneWorld.\\"S7 Airlines\\" http://www.oneworld.com/member-airlines/s7-airlines/ The Soviet aviation industry has unequivocally shifted to adapt more modern and Western philosophies of air travel, although it was the inventive Soviet style of air transportation that helped build Russia, its industries, and its widespread global influence into what it is today. Airports The Soviet Union had 7,192 airports, of which 1,163 had paved surface. By the 1980s most airports were having capacity problems, an example being the Lviv airport which had to cope with an average of 840 passengers each day, while the airport was built to handle 200. Another daunting problem was the lack of modernisation, with the Sheremetyevo International Airport (Moscow's main airport) being the only airport in the USSR to have been fully computerised.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 93. Pipeline network Soviet stamp dedicated to the Urengoy‚ÄìPomary‚ÄìUzhgorod pipeline The Soviet Union had, at its height, a pipeline network of for crude oil and another for natural gas. The Soviet authorities, under Leonid Brezhnev, began focusing on the national pipeline system in the 1970s. Soviet pipelines experienced a fast growth in the 1970s; by the late 1970s the pipeline network was the largest in the world. The average moving distance for oil and natural gas increased from 80 km in 1970 to 1,910 km in 1980, and 2,350 in 1988.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 58. Just as with many other sectors of the Soviet economy, bad maintenance led to deterioration. By the late 1980s only 1,500 km pipelines were under maintenance, half of what was minimally needed. Also, the storage facilities were inadequate to handle the growing Soviet oil supply. Failures in the pipelines network became, in the 1980s, a common feature of the system.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 188. Oil pipeline ruptures at oil fields were increasing up to an all-time high in 1990 and reached a 15 percent failure rate that year alone.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 207. Among the better known pipelines were the Northern Lights line from the Komi petroleum deposit to Brest on the Polish border, the Soiuz line running from Orenburg to Uzhgorod near the Czechoslovak and Hungarian borders, and the Export pipeline from the Urengoy gas field to L'vov and thence to First World countries, including Austria, Italy, West Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The 1,420-millimeter Export pipeline was 4,451 kilometers long. It crossed the Ural and Carpathian Mountains and almost 600 rivers, including the Ob', Volga, Don, and Dnepr. It had 41 compressor stations and a yearly capacity of 32 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Rail network A Soviet envelope celebrating the 150th anniversary of the first railways The Soviet Union had a non-industrial railway network of , of which were electrified. As the quality of rail transport continued to deteriorate, in part because of the Russian Civil War, some within the Soviet leadership claimed that the railways were not sustainable if congestions continued to increase. Those who advocated for an enlargement of rail transport felt that increased investment and the lengthening of already established rail tracks could solve the ongoing congestion crisis.Davies, Harrison and Wheatcroft 1994, p. 159‚Äì60. The majority agreed on increasing investments, but there was no clear consensus on how these investments were to be used. There were even some who believed in the recapitalisation of the railways. Gosplan economists in the meantime advocated for the rationalisation of the railways, coupled with tariffs based on actual cost, which would reduce traffic demand and provide funds for investment. The leadership was unable to reach a conclusion and the rail system continued to deteriorate. In 1931, in a Central Committee (CC) resolution, it was decided that increased investments coupled with the introduction of newer trains could solve the crisis. This resolution was never carried out, and yet again, the system continued to deteriorate.Davies, Harrison and Wheatcroft 1994, p. 160. The Central Committee ordered Lazar Kaganovich to solve the railway crisis in 1935. Kaganovich first prioritised bottleneck areas over other less-traveled areas; his second priority was investing in heavy traffic lines, and thirdly, the least efficient areas of the rail network were left to themselves.Davies, Harrison and Wheatcroft 1994, p. 160‚Äì61. Another problem facing rail transport was the massive industrialisation efforts pushed on by the authorities. The industrialisation proved to be a heavy burden on the railways, and Vyacheslav Molotov and Kaganovich even admitted this to the 18th party congress. Even so, the Soviet Government continued their industrialisation efforts to better prepare themselves for a future war with Germany, which became reality in 1941.Davies, Harrison and Wheatcroft 1994, p. 162‚Äì63. Russian locomotive class U - U-127 Lenin's 4-6-0 oil burning compound locomotive preserved at the Museum of the Moscow Railway at Paveletsky Rail Terminal Soviet rail transport became, after the Great Patriotic War, one of the most developed in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639 km a year from 1965 to 1980, while the growth of rail transport in First World countries was either decreasing or stagnating. This steady growth in rail transport can be explained by the country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or in Siberia. While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling one of the most electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place.Wilson 1983, p. 201. The efficiency of the railways improved over time, and by the 1980s it had many performance indicators superior to that of the United States.–®–∞—Ñ–µ—Ä–∏–Ω pp.17+: –°—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –î–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ –†–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–∏ –¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞ –°–°–°–† –∏ –°–®–ê (Comparative Data about the Development of Transportation in the USSR and USA) By the 1980s Soviet railways had become the most intensively used in the world. Most Soviet citizens did not own private transport, and if they did, it was difficult to drive long distances due to the poor conditions of many roads. Another explanation has to do with Soviet policy, the first being the autarkic model created by Joseph Stalin's regime. Stalin's regime had little interest in rail transport, or any other form for transport, and instead focused most of the country's investments in rapid industrialisation. Stalin's regime was not interested in establishing new railway lines, but decided to conserve, and later expand, much of the existing railways left behind by the Tsars. However, as Lev Voronin, a First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union, noted in a speech to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1989; the railway sector was the \\"main negative sector of the economy in 1989\\". As industrial output declined in the late-1980s so did the demand for transportation, which led to a decline in freight transport in return. Rapid transit The Soviet rapid transit system was seen as the quickest, cleanest and cheapest way of urban transport, and eventually another point acquired greater significance; the authorities could allocate their resources from the automobile industry to the rapid transit sector and save a substantial volume of the country's diesel and petrol. Because rapid transit systems usually were cheaper to operate and less energy consuming, the Soviet authorities managed to install 20 rapid transit systems in their union,Wilson 1983, p. 205. and had an additional nine under construction when it collapsed.Wilson 1983, p. 205‚Äì6. Twenty other stations were under construction in 1985.Wilson 1983, p. 206. The country's rapid transit system was the most extensively used in the world. Road network The Soviet Union had a road network of , of which were paved and were dirt roads. Road transport played a minor role in the Soviet economy, compared to domestic rail transport or First World road transport. According to historian Martin Crouch, road traffic of goods and passengers combined was only 14 percent of the volume of rail transport. It was only late in its existence that the Soviet authorities put emphasis on road construction and maintenance because of the vital role road transport usually played in the regional economies of the USSR. Road transport was of vital importance to agriculture, mining and the construction industry, but it also played a significant role in the urban economy. The road network had problems meeting the people's demand, a problem which the Soviet leadership publicly acknowledged. A resolution by the Central Committee laid down a plan for the improvement in planning, organisation and the efficiency of local road transport enterprises.Ambler, Shaw and Symons 1985, p. 165. Freight transport by motor vehicles, commonly called \\"motor transport\\" by the Soviet authorities, due to the underdeveloped nature of the nation's road network, was of considerable significance to certain areas of the economy. In the 1980s, there were 13 million laborers employed in the transport sector. Of those, about 8.5 million were employed in motor transport. Inter-city freight transport remained underdeveloped during the whole Soviet epoch, with it constituting less than 1 percent of the motor-borne freight average. These developments can again be blamed on cost and administrative inefficiencies. Road transport as a whole lagged far behind that of rail transport; the average distance moved by motor transport in 1982 was , while the average for railway transport was 930 km per ton and 435 km per ton for water freight. In 1982 there was a threefold increase in investment since 1960 in motor freight transport, and more than a thirtyfold increase since 1940. Inter-city transport and the volume of road freight transport had also increased significantly.Ambler, Shaw and Symons 1985, p. 166. Motor transport was much cheaper and flexible over short distances (defined as less than 200 km) than rail transport. There were many Soviet economists who argued that transferring some 100 million tons from the railways to road transport would save up to 120 million rubles. But in 1975, road transport was 27-times more expensive than railway transport, due to long distances between starting points and destinations.Ambler, Shaw and Symons 1985, p. 166‚Äì67. The deteriorating quality of roads was due to bad attendance, and the then ongoing growth in road transport made it even harder for the Soviet authorities to focus their resources on attendance and maintenance projects. The transport of freight by road had increased by 4,400 percent in the past thirty years, while the growth of hardcore surfaced roads had grown only by 300 percent. Growth of motor vehicles had increased by 224 percent in the 1980s, while hardcore surfaced roads only increased by 64 percent. As Soviet economists in the early to mid-1980s said, the Soviet Union had 21 percent of the world's industrial output, but only a meager 7 percent of the world's top quality roads. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981‚Äì85; spanned through the rules of Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko) called for the construction of an additional 80,000 km hardcore surfaced roads, but this was far from adequate in solving the serious shortage, and the planners needed to build at least twice as many roads to meet consumer demand. Another obstacle was that Five-Year Plans in the USSR's later life were rarely fulfilled due to economic malfunctions. Many roads were not paved, and because of this shortage, several dirt roads were created.Ambler, Shaw and Symons 1985, p. 167. By 1975 only 0.8 percent of households owned a car.Ambler, Shaw and Symons 1985, p. 168. Productions of cars, however, had increased dramatically in the late 1970s. From 1924 to 1971 the USSR produced 1 million vehicles, and the government passed another milestones five years later when it had produced 2 million vehicles.Ambler, Shaw and Symons 1985, p. 169. Bus transport Only a very small proportion of the population in the USSR owned cars. Because of the widespread lack of any mode of private transport, most Soviet citizens travelled via public transport. Due to a relative shortage of cars and good- quality roads, the Soviet people travelled twice as much by bus, train and rapid transit as people in the First World.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 56. Soviet bus-transport, throughout most of the history of the Soviet Union, was controlled either by the regional or the republican branches of the Ministry of Transport. Since rail transit systems were more environmental and consumed little fuel, Soviet planners concentrated their efforts in constructing electricity-driven, rather than fuel-consuming transport.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 87. In the mid-1980s the government initiated a programme for compressed-gas energy for buses. By 1988 only 1.2 percent of buses used gas energy, while 30 percent used diesel.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 87‚Äì8. Soviet bus- enterprises ran a deficit for the first time in their history by the mid-to- late 1980s. International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 88. Water transport The Soviet Union had of coastline and 1,565 ships in the merchant marine. Marine industry was under the control of the Ministry of the Merchant Marine Fleet of the USSR.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 97. Merchant marine A freight boat in the Moskva River The Russian Empire concentrated much of its investment on constructing new shipbuilding facilities, and not enlarging their merchant marine; this policy continued in the prewar USSR. By 1913 85 percent of all merchant ships were foreign built. The merchant marine was overlooked during the regime of Joseph Stalin, because the USSR traded mostly with its neighbouring countries in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet trade later expanded to its neighbouring countries in Asia. When Stalin died in 1953, his successor started to increase trade with non-communist countries, most of which were on other continents. Due to this policy, the merchant marine increased from 2 million deadweight tonnage in the early 1950s to 12 million in 1968. By 1974 it had reached 14.1 million deadweight tons, about 3 percent of the world's total. Of the 114 million tons moved by the Soviet merchant marine in 1974, 90 million of it was export and import.Grzybowski 1987, p. 3. While the merchant marine was technologically outdated, and slower than that of the First World, it still attracted a consistent volume of cargo.Wilson 1983, p. 4. The reason for the technological backwardness of the merchant marine were First World induced boycotts of Soviet shipping. This led the Soviet Union to become isolated from the international shipping industry, and skip over such important innovations as shipping containers. Under Mikhail Gorbachev's rule the Soviet Union became the largest buyer of new ships in the world.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 96. Because of the size of its navy, the Soviet Government advocated for the traditional freedoms of the sea.Grzybowski 1987, p. 6. By 1990 Soviet Union operated a large merchant fleet with more than 2400 ships of all types ‚Äî the world's second largest in number of ships and seventh largest in carrying capacity.The Naval Institute Guide to the Soviet Navy. 1991, p. 431. Ports The Soviet Union had 26 major ports, eleven of them inland ports. There were 70 ports in total.International Monetary Fund and OECD 1991, p. 98. None of the ports could be considered major by world standards.Ambler, Shaw and Symons 1985, p. 131. By the 1980s the majority of Soviet ports were lagging behind the First World technologically.

Thioredoxin serves as a general protein disulfide oxidoreductase. It interacts with a broad range of proteins by a redox mechanism based on reversible oxidation of 2 cysteine thiol groups to a disulfide, accompanied by the transfer of 2 electrons and 2 protons. The net result is the covalent interconversion of a disulfide and a dithiol. TR-S2 \\\\+ NADPH + H+ -> TR-(SH)2 \\\\+ NADP+ (1) trx-S2 \\\\+ TR-(SH)2 -> trx-(SH)2 \\\\+ TR-S2 (2) Protein-S2 \\\\+ trx-(SH)2 -> Protein-(SH)2 \\\\+ trx-S2 (3) In the NADPH- dependent protein disulfide reduction, thioredoxin reductase (TR) catalyses reduction of oxidised thioredoxin (trx) by NADPH using FAD and its redox- active disulfide (steps 1 and 2). Reduced thioredoxin then directly reduces the disulfide in the substrate protein (step 3). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a resident foldase of the endoplasmic recticulum, is a multi-functional protein that catalyses the formation and isomerisation of disulfide bonds during protein folding. PDI contains 2 redox active domains, near the N- and C-termini, that are similar to thioredoxin: both contribute to disulfide isomerase activity, but are functionally non-equivalent. A mutant PDI, with all 4 of the active cysteines replaced by serine, displays a low but detectable level of disulfide isomerase activity. Moreover, PDI exhibits chaperone-like activity towards proteins that contain no disulfide bonds, i.e. behaving independently of its disulfide isomerase activity. A number of endoplasmic reticulum proteins that differ from the PDI major isozyme contain 2 (ERp60, ERp5) or 3 (ERp72) thioredoxin domains; all of them seem to be PDIs. 3D-structures have been determined for a number of thioredoxins. The molecule has a doubly wound alternating alpha/beta fold, consisting of a 5-stranded parallel beta-sheet core, enclosed by 4 alpha-helices. The active site disulfide is located at the N-terminus of helix 2 in a short segment that is separated from the rest of the helix by a kink caused by a conserved proline. The 4-membered disulfide ring is located on the surface of the protein. A flat hydrophobic surface lies adjacent to the disulfide, which presumably facilitates interaction with other proteins. One invariant feature of all thioredoxins is a cis-proline located in a loop preceding beta-strand 4. This residue is positioned in van der Waals contact with the active site cysteines and is important both for stability and function. Thioredoxin belongs to a structural family that includes glutaredoxin, glutathione peroxidase, bacterial protein disulfide isomerase DsbA, and the N-terminal domain of glutathione transferase. Thioredoxins have a beta-alpha unit preceding the motif common to all these proteins.

The Electro-Motive Diesel type EMD diesel-electric locomotives were to be rebuilt from Classes and type GT26MC and Class type GT26M2C locomotives.

It was intended to produce one hundred Class , but in spite of the technical success of the TRE part of the project, rebuilding was halted after completing only five locomotives, allegedly due to higher than anticipated cost. Instead of rebuilding one hundred old locomotives, it was decided to rather continue the program by building fifty new Class locomotives.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The bridge is sometimes referred to as the \\"Wedding Ring Bridge\\" or the \\"Bridge of Sighs\\". In both 2002 and 2006, the bridge was listed as one of the \\"Eleven Most Endangered Historic Places in Nevada\\" by Preserve Nevada, a historic preservation organization partnered with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). Due to structural and flood-control concerns, the bridge was replaced in 2016. History The Virginia Street Bridge, ca. 1910. Built in 1905, the current Virginia Street Bridge is the fifth in a series of bridges to have been built in downtown Reno. The first was a wooden bridge built in 1860 by Charles W. Fuller and was hence called Fuller's Crossing. After it was destroyed by a flood, a second bridge, a toll bridge, was built and sold to Myron Lake in 1861, although in 1867 it was also destroyed by a flood. Even though it was replaced by yet another bridge, it became unneeded after the arrival of the Transcontinental Railroad. In 1877, the Washoe County authorized the creation of a new tied-arch bridge made of iron. In 1905, the iron bridge was moved and the current bridge, designed by San Francisco architect John B. Leonard, was built by Cotton Brothers and Company of Oakland, California. Legend Legend has it that newly divorced women would, after exiting the Washoe County Courthouse, stand on the Virginia Street Bridge and cast their wedding rings into the Truckee River below. Hence, the bridge became known as the main symbol of Reno, which was called the \\"Divorce Capital of the World\\" beginning in 1906. Over the years, salvage divers have found actual rings, according to archivist Guy Rocha. In the 1961 film The Misfits, Marilyn Monroe considers tossing her wedding ring from the Virginia Street Bridge, but decides against it.

He passed out from Sandhurst where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Border Regiment on 2 February 1933. He served initially with the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment, in Northern Ireland, until 1935 when he was sent to the 2nd Battalion of the regiment, where he served in India, seeing active service on the North-West Frontier in 1937. While there he received a promotion to lieutenant on 2 February 1936. He remained with the battalion until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. In the same year he married Clodagh, the youngest daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Bertrand Russell; they had three sons. Second World War Shortly after war began, Haddon, who on 3 September was promoted to the acting rank of captain, transferred to the 1st Battalion, Borders, then serving in England as part of Brigadier Noel Irwin's 6th Infantry Brigade, itself one of three brigades forming Major General Charles Loyd's 2nd Infantry Division, and was made Officer Commanding (OC) \\"B\\" Company. Along with the rest of the division, Haddon's battalion was sent to France in late September where it became part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). His rank of captain being made temporary on 3 December, in February 1940 he was made adjutant of his battalion, which in May was transferred to the 125th Brigade, part of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation, which had only recently arrived in France.http://www.pegasusarchive.org/arnhem/tommy_haddon.htm Subsequently, when the German Army invaded France three months later, Haddon was involved in the rearguard action towards Dunkirk in late May, from where the battalion, by now having suffered heavy losses and much reduced in men and equipment, were eventually evacuated from Dunkirk to England (see Dunkirk evacuation). After returning to England the battalion spent most of the rest of 1940 reorganising and reforming after its losses, and preparing to repel an expected German invasion. He remained with the battalion, which in December 1940 transferred to the 31st Independent Brigade, until May 1941 when Haddon, by now a captain (having been promoted on 2 February), left to attend a shortened course at the Staff College, Camberley. After graduating in November he was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee of the War Cabinet. Haddon was duty officer on the night of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the U.S. fleet on 7 December; it was he who passed the news on to Downing Street, leading Prime Minister Winston Churchill to immediately contact U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He then served throughout 1942 in a variety of staff appointments until, on 27 January 1943, Haddon returned to the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment, now as second-in-command. During Haddon's absence the battalion had been transferred to the airborne forces and converted into a glider infantry unit, and now formed part of Brigadier Philip Hicks's 1st Airlanding Brigade, itself part of the 1st Airborne Division under Major General Frederick Browning. In April the division departed for overseas, arriving in North Africa towards the end of the month, and commenced training for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). Seeing action in Sicily and North Africa, Haddon was promoted acting lieutenant colonel in command of the 1st battalion of the Border Regiment forming part of the British 1st Airborne Division that, in \\"Operation Market Garden\\" attempted to take and hold the Arnhem Bridge, the last bridge across the Rhine, the taking of which would have allowed the Allies to enter Germany before the winter of 1944‚àí1945. However, Haddon was destined to play little part in the Battle of Arnhem. On Sunday 17 September 1944, the first day of \\"Operation Market Garden\\", Haddon's glider took off on the first lift from Broadwell airfield, but had to make a forced landing while still over Oxfordshire. On the second glider lift, the next day, 18 September, Haddon's glider had a wing shot off near Antwerp and was forced to make a crash landing, 75 miles from Arnhem and behind enemy lines, so while the 1st Border battalion was fighting for the bridgehead at Arnhem, its commanding officer was proceeding overland, having met up with a battalion of the Dorset Regiment. left Haddon eventually managed to reach the Oosterbeek area alone late on the following Sunday, 24 September, but was taken prisoner by the Germans the next morning while attempting to find his unit. Haddon was to spend the remainder of the war as a prisoner at Oflag XIIB camp, near Hadamar.
