The college opened in 1993, following the amalgamation of the colleges of St Bede's, Mthatha and St Paul's, Grahamstown. Although the buildings and location were inherited from St Paul's, the college's growth has been marked by the spirit, motives and perceptions that sustained both former colleges.  Before 1993  St Bede's College by Harriet Mason c. 1901 St Bede's College in Mthatha was founded in 1879 by Henry Callaway, the first bishop of the Diocese of St John. The purpose of the institution was the \\"training of young natives, and colonists as clergy and teachers.\\" At that time the primary task was to train clergy and catechist for the diocese. A shift happened in the mid-twentieth century when the college was given some provincial recognition as a result of a synod of bishops in 1955. Pressures brought to bear by the apartheid regime, and other institutional factors, resulted in the consideration of different schemes of amalgamation as early as the seventies. The college was temporarily closed in 1983 and the premises were leased to the University of Transkei for a year, before being re-opened in 1985. At the time of its closure in 1992 the college had an influential role in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. St Paul's College in Grahamstown was founded in 1902, by Bishop Charles Cornish. The initial idea of a college came from Bishop Allan Webb, Bishop of Grahamstown. He brought a vision of theological education with him, having been vice- principal of Cuddesdon Theological College, Oxford. The hostel was opened for the reception of theological students in 1902. In 1910 work began on a new west wing to increase its capacity. The college also officially became a Provincial college. Between 1929 and 1931 further alterations took place. Cullen House was purchased in 1933. The college went through difficult times during both world wars as numbers declined, even closing for five months in 1943. Extensive additions were again made in the 1950s, with the Espin Wing and new chapel being dedicated in 1957. The Burnett wing was completed in 1962. Like St Bede's, St Paul's was affected by fluctuating numbers. It was also faced with the particular pressures of apartheid as it sought to be racially mixed. At the time of its closure in 1992 the college was about eighty percent \\"black\\". When the St Bede's and St Paul's were closed, the site chosen for the new college for the Anglican Church of Southern Africa was the old campus of St Paul's. The amalgamated college was initially called \\"Peter Masiza College\\", after the first ordained black priest in the province. Subsequent research showed that the name was problematic and the \\"College of the Transfiguration\\" was chosen, influenced by the then, Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

It was released in 2011 for button-operated/keypad-based mobile phones, in August 2008 in Japan for the Wii and on February 5, 2009 worldwide for iOS devices via the Apple App Store.  Plot Gameplay= Mobile  Wild West Guns is a side-scrolling top- down open-world action-adventure video game. The game world may be traversed on foot or by horse. Missions involve fistfights, shooting, tailing or chasing, horse-riding, and/or setting off explosives. The player can buy weapons at shops and kill non-player characters (NPCs), and it is possible to call Jack Barnes's acquired horse to give a ride. If the player commits a crime within the line of sight of a Sheriff, they will gain a wanted level that will cause Sheriffs to turn hostile towards them. They may either hide or pay money at churches in order to decrease the wanted level.  Wii  An American Old West-themed light gun shooter, the game sees the player shooting at targets ranging from vultures, balloons and flying sombreros to armed robbers, angry gold diggers and renegade soldiers across a number of environments such as saloons, cemeteries and a speeding steam locomotive. The game features 6 levels across two difficulties, with 3 challenges in each. The game also supports the Wii Zapper peripheral on the Wii, but does not feature aim calibration. Reception The Wii version of Wild West Guns received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Official Nintendo Magazine praised the variety in settings and the interactive environments, and the simple point and shoot gameplay, though they felt genre experts might find it too easy. Nintendo Life felt the game was \\"addictive and attractive\\" and \\"very well executed\\", and highlighted the depth in gameplay that requires players to carefully choose their shots to score the most points. However, they felt the relatively small range of objectives, settings and enemies was \\"somewhat disappointing\\", and that the omission of scoreboards affected replay value. In contrast, Eurogamer was less impressed with the Wii version, calling it \\"a rather limited and repetitive experience\\". 1UP.com believed said console version was \\"a little pricey\\" at 1000 Wii Points. IGN also had issues with the price and the shallow nature of the same console version, but otherwise felt it was \\"fun\\", praising the tight controls and polished presentation.

It develops, manufactures, and supports devices and their related software drivers for converting RS-232 or TTL serial transmissions to USB signals, in order to allow support for legacy devices with modern computers. FTDI provides application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design services. They also provide consultancy services for product design, specifically in the realm of electronic devices. History FTDI TTL-232RG: USB to UART cable IC (in SSOP package) Die of FTDI FT232RL chip FTDI was founded on 13 March 1992 by its current CEO Fred Dart. The company is an indirect descendant of Computer Design Concepts Ltd, a former semiconductor technology startup, founded by Dart. FTDI's initial products were chipsets for personal computer motherboards, the primary customer of which was IBM, which used them in its AMBRA and PS/1 personal computers. It later expanded its product line to include interface translators, such as the MM232R and the USB- COM232-PLUS1, along with other devices for converting between USB and other communication protocols. Currently, the headquarters for FTDI is located in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, while it also has offices in Singapore, Taipei, Taiwan, and Portland, Oregon. The company's manufacturing division is handled by subcontractors in the Asia Pacific region. Driver controversy On 29 September 2014, FTDI released an updated version of their USB-to-Serial driver for Windows on their website. Users who manually downloaded the new drivers reported problems. After Windows drivers became available on 14 October (Patch Tuesday) via Windows Update, it was reported by users of hardware enthusiast forums and websites that the drivers could soft-brick counterfeit and software-compatible clones of the chips by changing their USB \\"Product ID\\" to \\"0000\\". The change prevents the chip from being recognised by drivers of any OS, effectively making them inoperable unless the product ID is changed back. The behaviour was supported by a notice in the drivers' end user license agreement, which warned that use of the drivers with non-genuine FTDI products would \\"irretrievably damage\\" them. Critics felt that FTDI's actions were unethical, considering that users may be unaware that their chips were counterfeit, or that Windows had automatically installed a driver meant to disable them. On 22 October 2014, an emergency patch was made to the FTDI drivers in the Linux kernel to recognise devices with the \\"0000\\" ID. On 24 October 2014, in response to the criticism, FTDI withdrew the driver and admitted that the measure was intended to protect its intellectual property and encourage users to purchase genuine FTDI products. The company also stated that it was working to create an updated driver which would notify users of non-genuine FTDI products in a \\"non-invasive\\" manner. In February 2016, it was reported that FTDI had published another driver on Windows Update with DRM components intended to block non-genuine products. This time, the driver will communicate with affected devices, but all transmitted and received data is replaced with the arbitrary, looped ASCII string \\"NON GENUINE DEVICE FOUND!\\", which could cause irregular interactions with devices. Distribution FTDI sells its products through major distributors around the world.

The site of the former prison is located about two miles south of the centre of the village of Ashwell, alongside the road to Oakham and opposite the former kennels of the Cottesmore Hunt. The prison closed in 2011 and Rutland County Council acquired it from the Ministry of Justice in early 2013. The site has been redeveloped as Oakham Enterprise Park, a business park for office and light industrial use. History Ashwell Prison was constructed on the site of a World War II US army base (home to part of the 82nd Airborne Division), and first opened in 1955 as an open prison for adult male prisoners. In October 1987 it was converted to an Adult Male Category C establishment. In 2003 Ashwell Prison hit the headlines after four prisoners went on a wrecking spree, damaging ¬£10,000 worth of office equipment, computers and windows. The trouble started when an officer found an inmate had been drinking alcohol in his cell. Despite this incident Ashwell achieved Resettlement Stage 1 accreditation in the same year. A 2005 inspection report of Ashwell cited concerns about prisoners' vulnerability, race relations and the quality of work and training at the prison. In the same year an inmate at the prison escaped from guards while receiving treatment for tuberculosis at the Leicester Royal Infirmary. The prisoner was recaptured days later In July 2008 a new ¬£6m wing with an additional 64 cells was opened at Ashwell Prison. The new wing increased the overall capacity of the prison to 619 inmates. A major riot at Ashwell Prison began on 11 April 2009. During the riot, a three-mile police perimeter was put in place, which extended to the edges of Oakham. Several prisoners were evacuated from the prison. Trouble started at approximately 0100 BST on 11 April and a fire broke out at the prison during the afternoon. The riot was successfully brought under control at 2245 BST that day. The operation launched by authorities in response to the riot was called Operation Tornado which saw the introduction of specialist riot-trained prison staff. Three prisoners were injured and 75% of the prison was made uninhabitable. The riot started when a prisoner, serving a three-year sentence, confronted staff and refused to return to his room. He began to cause damage and was joined by others. The unrest spread quickly throughout the prison and approximately 400 prisoners are thought to have participated. No member of staff was injured or directly attacked. The damage done to three of the old wings was substantial. The rest of the prison was either undamaged or sustained superficial damage. The event provoked questioning of the UK's overcrowded prison system leading to Category B prisoners' downgrading so that they can be moved to Category C prisons. In January 2011, it was announced that Ashwell Prison was to close, as the cost of repairing and maintaining the building was too high. The prison formally closed at the end of March 2011, when all inmates had transferred to other prisons. In January 2013, Rutland County Council announced that it had finalised a deal to buy the former prison from the Ministry of Justice in order to convert the site into a business park. The site was redeveloped throughout 2013, with some accommodation blocks damaged during the riots demolished and new units built in their place. Oakham Enterprise Park has now opened with some units converted for business use. Some of the original buildings remain together with the fence; those are used for airsoft events and military training. Notable former inmates * Lee Hughes, the professional footballer spent time in Ashwell from 2004 after being convicted of death by dangerous driving. Hughes went on to become manager of the prison's football team.

Definition Police tactical units or SWAT teams are part of a police force tasked with resolving high risk/critical incidents, including: * high risk armed offender/suspect searches/apprehensions including arrest warrant * high risk search warrants involving an armed/dangerous offender/suspect * siege/barricade incidents involving an armed offender/suspect * domestic counter-terrorism incidents such as hostage rescue and/or armed intervention (including units that may be granted authority for overseas operations) In the United States, most police tactical units are known by the generic term of Special Weapons And Tactics (SWAT) team (other countries have adopted this term). In Australia, police tactical units are formally known as a police tactical group. The European Union uses the term Special Intervention Unit to define national counter terrorist police tactical units.

It is greyish and differentiated from other grey Lactarius by its widely spaced, yellow gills. It is found on the forest floor in mixed woodland, especially at the base of hazel trees. Taxonomy Lactarius pyrogalus was first described by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard as Agaricus pyrogalus in 1792, before being given its current binomial name by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. Description Lactarius pyrogalus has a cap across which is grey fawn, sometimes with a yellowish tinge, with pink and purple tinges not unknown. It is flattened convex to flat, later becoming funnel shaped. The cap is sometimes faintly concentrically banded, it is thin fleshed and becomes sticky when moist, but is not shiny. The stem is between 4 and 6 cm, and between 7 and 15 mm thick, generally cylindrical but sometimes slightly swollen at the base. The stem is whitish or concolorous with the cap, with whitish flesh. It has slightly decurrent gills, which are yellow to flesh coloured, though later become a cinnamon-ochre colour. The well-spaced, yellow gills differentiate it from other greyish Lactarius species. An underside view of L. pyrogalus showing the widely spaced gills exuding drops of white latex. Spores Lactarius pyrogalus produces a light ochre spore print; the spores are broadly elliptic, with warts generally joined by a moderately thick ridges in a well- developed network. The spores are 7-8 by 5.5-7 ¬µm in size. The spores are amyloid, meaning they stain dark blue in Melzer's reagent, and feature an incomplete net. Distribution Lactarius pyrogalus is fairly common and is generally found at the base of hazel trees alone or in scattered groups. It is particularly common in hazel woodland managed for coppice. It can also be found elsewhere on the ground in mixed woodland. It is found in the autumn months of August, September and October. Edibility Lactarius pyrogalus has a very hot, acrid taste and is acidic. It is due to this taste that it received both its English name, fire-milk lactarius, and its scientific name, with \\"pyrogalus\\" translating as \\"fire milk\\". Despite not being poisonous, it is not regarded as edible and should be avoided. This is unlike its relative, the saffron milk-cap (L. deliciosus), which is regarded as a choice mushroom.Phillips, 80.

It is the man in the street that I'm after, whom I feel closest to, with whom I want to make friends and enter into confidence and connivance, and he is the one I want to please and enchant by means of my work\\". Despite his reclusive nature, his paintings combined sharp observations of people going about their daily lives with strong, impressionist colours and expressive brushwork. His paintings are included in many private and public collections including Brighton and Hove Art Gallery, Liverpool University, the University of Warwick, Torquay Art Gallery and Russell Coates Gallery Bournemouth. Biography Fred Yates was born in Urmston, Lancashire, England in 1922. He began his working life as an insurance clerk but this career was cut short by the Second World War, during which he served with the Grenadier Guards. His twin brother was posted missing in action during the failed attempt to capture the bridge at Arnhem during Operation Market Garden in September 1944.https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book- search/title/fred-yates/author/axten-janet/ The loss of his brother had a profound effect on Yates and the sense of isolation made him fearful of close relationships throughout his life. Nonetheless, it gave him the resolve to give up insurance work and, against his family's wishes, become an artist. With a serviceman's grant he enrolled at Bournemouth Teacher Training College where he received a formal education in drawing, printmaking and painting and won a scholarship to Rome. He then taught in Devon and the South Coast for the next 20 years, a profession which brought some security, but which he disliked enormously. His shyness and gentle manner made it impossible to maintain any discipline in the classroom and the only way he could keep control was to embark on painting demonstrations where he could lose himself in his work and try not to notice the pupils behind him.https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book- search/title/fred-yates/author/axten-janet/ Nonetheless he continued painting in his own right and in 1954 came second to L.S. Lowry for his painting of Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club in a competition organised by the Football Association. The painting is now in the collection of Brighton Museum and Art Gallery  Cornwall  In 1968 he finally made the decision to quit teaching and become a full-time painter, moving to Cornwall where he could develop his work supplementing his income with gardening work for neighbours. Most of his early work was painted outdoors on rough boards using household paints, but his approachable style and manner earned him some notable early collectors and in 1976 he had his first solo show at the Reynolds Gallery in Plymouth and in the same year was a finalist in the John Moore's Prize. During the 1970s and 80's Yates began to gain wider acceptance and in 1992 had his first London exhibition with Thompson's Gallery.  France  Yates's solitary nature and fear of emotional entanglements made him a habitual house- mover. In the early 1990s Yates moved to France, first of all to a mill house near Beaume De Venise, then to the village of Rancon in the Dordogne, later back to Sablet in Provence, then Nyons and finally the mountain village of La Motte in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes. It was during this period that Yates began to produce some of his most daring paintings, often working with huge quantities of paint applied by stick or hands. In his last years he made repeated efforts to return to England, eventually finding a small house in Frome, Somerset. It was on his journey to complete the purchase that he fell and suffered a heart attack. He died in University College Hospital and is buried in Marazion Cornwall Exhibitions Fred Yates's principle representative during his life was John Martin Gallery in London. The gallery held numerous exhibitions of Yates's work including 'Twelve Months in Provence' (2003) 'On Top of the World' (2004) and 'Muck and Brass' (2008).

She was still operating as a working tugboat as recently as May 2007. She was sunk as an artificial reef in January 2011. History The tugboat's original namesake, Thomas Cunningham Sr. Thomas Cunningham Sr. was built in 1895 by Neafie & Levy of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the Army Corps of Engineers. She was operated by the Harbour Board of the Port of Richmond, Virginia for more than eighty years. After 45 years of service, Thomas Cunningham Sr. was sent to Newport News for the annual inspection where she was placed into \\"durance vile\\"--meaning the vessel was considered unsafe to operate. Her papers were seized and she was suspended from duty until repairs were made. The main complaint was deck issues. The Richmond City Council quickly approved the budget extension for $8,000 to get the repairs completed and get their tug back. Starting in late 1948, Thomas Cunningham Sr. finally got a much needed major refit. The wooden pilot house and deck were replaced with steel versions, and a Cleveland 8-268A diesel engine was installed to replace the original steam engine. The entire cost of the project, including sending two maintenance people to the Cleveland factory for training, was $65,927.02. Out of the nine bidders for the work, Dunn's Marine Railway, Inc. of West Norfolk won the bid and completed the work approximately $11,000 under budget. In 1977 the vessel was sold into private hands, and reportedly became a salvage tug in Florida. In May 2007, the tug was placed on the market by her owners, a salvage company, who were hoping to sell her to restorers. As of 2008, she was registered as a recreational vessel according to the U.S. Coast Guard's Port State Information eXchange. As of September 2010, Tuff-E-Nuff was on a sandbar in Georgia the organization Think It Sink It Reef It was working to sink the tug as an artificial reef. On 17 January 2011, Tuff-E-Nuff was placed off St. Lucie, Florida as the Kyle Conrad Memorial Reef.

The business, which was active from 1867 until 1924, 'caught the wave' of the cotton-boom that existed following the end of the American Civil War in 1865 and experienced rapid growth in the United Kingdom and abroad.Manchester of Today (An epitome of results) - Business Men and Commercial Interests, Historical Publishing Company, 90 Chancery Lane, London, 1888 (Source: British Lending Library). In 1897, the business split into two with the sewing cotton operation being subsumed into the newly formed English Sewing Cotton Company (ESCC). The remainder of the Bagley & Wright business remaining independent in the form of Bagley & Wright Manufacturing. Although the Wright and Bagley families lost influence on the ESCC part of the business following a scandal over the distribution of dividends in 1902, they remained in control of Bagley and Wright Manufacturing until it was finally dissolved in 1924. Throughout the existence of the business, the influence of the Wesleyan Church in Oldham was substantial in the formation of the friendships and partnerships that were the engines for business success.  The founders  Benjamin Wright in 1897 Benjamin Wright and Ralph Bagley were born in 1837 and 1839 respectively.1861 census returns, United Kingdom National Archives, Kew, London Wright was born into poverty in Ashton-under-Lyne (also known as Ashton). His father William and mother Mary were both born in 1803 in Ashton and, by 1841, were living in the village of Lees, on the border with Oldham, with their nine children; Hannah 17-years, John 15, James 14, Sarah 11, Nancy 9, Eliza 7, Betty 5, Benjamin 3 and William aged 1.1841 census returns, United Kingdom National Archives, Kew, London The three oldest children were working as cotton piecers, the middle three were at school and Benjamin and William junior were of pre-school age. Father William was an operative cotton spinner but Mary was not employed. Despite three of the children being employed, the family was poor. The father would command a 'reasonable' wage but the children would contribute little to family income. With six dependent mouths to feed, the family would have found life a struggle and the fact that Sarah at age 11 was still at school suggests that the parents were committed to their children's betterment. Financial pressure increased in 1843 with the birth of Joseph who was to play a major part in the business.Birth certificate, UK National Archives, Kew, London Benjamin started work at the age of seven 1845. His first job was as a little piecer in Henry Atherton's Woodend Cotton Mill on Woodend Street in Lees. This involved fetching and carrying for the spinner and piecer as well as keeping the mules clean by sweeping behind the carriages. He worked his way through the usual progression from little piecer to piecer and, sometime around the age of 20, was working as a qualified spinner. He moved to work for Daniel Collinge and Sons at Moorhey Mills (known locally as Dan Coll's factory) on Moorhey Street, Glodwick, and must have impressed, because he was given the position of 'Outlooker' at Dan Coll's and subsequent to that became manager of the mill.Gurr, D. and Hunt, J. The Cotton Mills of Oldham, edition 3, It is not known how Benjamin Wright and his future business partner Ralph Bagley first met. However, it is known that they both worked at Dan Coll's. Ralph Bagley in 1897 Ralph was born at Cow Hill, Oldham, the son of Thomas Bagley (born 1798) a general labourer and Hannah (born 1799) a cotton hand-loom weaver. Thomas had been born in Manchester and Hannah in Cheshire. In 1851,1851 census returns, United Kingdom National Archives, Kew, London Ralph was 12 years old and he and his younger sister Ann were at school. That Ralph was not in full-time employment at age twelve is unusual for working families of the time and reflects the fact that the family was small and the children were at an age where both parents were able to work. It is possible that the family had a loom in their home for Hannah to work on and this could have been an important factor. It is known that Ralph also had an older sister called Sarah who would have been 17 years old in 1851. However, Sarah does not appear in the 1851 census as resident at Cow Hill and she may have been living somewhere else as a 'live-in' housemaid. By 1861, she had returned to the family home (defined as 59 Cow Hill) to live with Thomas (65-years), Ralph (21-years) and Ann (19-years). By 1861, there is no record of Ralph's mother Hannah who would have been 62 years old. At this time, the average age at death for working class women was 53 and for men 47, so it is possible that Hannah had died between 1851 and 1861. The 1861 census shows that Ralph was employed as an iron turner, working in a factory and using a lathe to turn iron produced in the foundry into bars. Ann had found employment as a power loom weaver. This followed her mother's occupation but, at the same time, reflected the inexorable move towards automation. Although Ralph Bagley was an iron turner in 1861 we do not know where he was working. The largest employers of iron turners in the area were the large textile machinery manufacturing companies. It seems possible that he might have changed his job to work in Dan Coll's factory. It is unlikely that, at the age of 22, he would have been able to retrain as a spinner, but he may have found employment in the workshop at Moorhey Mills where repairs to the mill machinery would have been undertaken. Whatever the nature of Ralph's job at Moorhey, it was likely to be here that he met Benjamin and formed the partnership that flourished over the next 40 years. The presence of cotton spinning, coal mining, and iron founding can be seen in the jobs that the Wright and Bagley families were involved with in 1861. In addition to Bagley's job as an iron turner and Wright's cotton spinning, Wright's daughter Hannah (Benjamin's sister) had married Jacob Marland from Ashton whose family was related to the Marland family that owned Bower colliery. Jacob ran a small operation that employed five miners in Ashton, with two of his employees living as lodgers in his house.  The beginning of partnership ‚Äì 1860 to 1870  The partnership between Benjamin Wright and Ralph Bagley was based on friendship as well as business acumen. In the mid-1860s, the textile industry in Lancashire was undergoing one of its periods of rapid growth. The American Civil War that started in 1861, and caused the Lancashire Cotton Famine cotton towns, ended in 1865. Despite the famine during the first half of the decade, recovery afterwards was rapid and the cotton industry responded with a period of exuberant growth. For anyone with the necessary skills, knowledge and acceptance of risk, this was a time when entering into business was relatively easy. Budding entrepreneurs could rent 'space and power' from a mill owner operating as a commercial landlord. In many cases the entrepreneur would rent a floor of a mill which was served by line shafting powered by a steam engine somewhere else in the building. The floor might already have machinery (spinning mules, carding engines or looms) installed or he might have approached a cotton machinery manufacturer who would rent or lease the machinery to him. If up-front cash was a problem, the banks were likely to oblige with a loan. By 1863, Bagley and Benjamin Wright had left their positions at Dan Coll's factory and had set up a partnership with Samuel Milne, a major figure in Oldham's cotton spinning industry. The business, called 'Bagley, Wright & Milne', started in part of an old (even then, it was old) shed in Roscoe Street in 1867.Blyth, H.E., Through the Eye of a Needle; the story of the English Sewing Cotton Company, 1947, ISBN B000X8G17A. Wright's younger brother Joseph also joined this enterprise. Joseph Wright had started work in 1850 when he was 9-years old. His first employment was in the jenny gate but he graduated to minder and overlooker before taking a management role in the Bagley & Wright concern.The Oldham Chronicle, 6 December 1930 Most of the Roscoe Street shed was taken up with looms but there was some spinning capacity on mules available for renting. Also around this time, Bagley and Benjamin Wright went into partnership with a spinner called John Marsden; the business being called John Marsden and Company based at Crabtree Mill. All of the partners of these concerns were followers of Wesleyan Methodism in Glodwick which was going through a period of rapid growth both in terms of numbers of followers and confidence. In the second half of the 19th century, Wesleyanism in particular and Methodism in general, were seen as the religion of choice for the upwardly mobile middle classes because of the encouragement that it gave its adherents to better themselves through work and enterprise. The religion of Wright's parents is unknown, but in 1866 Benjamin and Joseph Wright had joined Glodwick Trinity Wesleyan Church which was then held in 'The Old Garret' in Well Fold, Oldham.Fifty years of Methodism in Glodwick 1863 to 1913, Oldham Local Studies Library, Accession number L1900, Classification number RO:FS.  Business growth ‚Äì 1870 to 1880  Joseph Wright circa 1910 While the Wright brothers were dividing their time between business and church, their business associates were giving time to other aspects of public work. The Chadderton Board of Health had been formed (rather belatedly) in 1872 following government legislation. One of the first Board members was Joseph Wright's future business partner, Jakeh Travis, who was elected to it for the 1873/4 session. Also elected in that year was John Marland a colliery proprietor. John was the brother of Hannah Wright's husband Jacob Marland. Ten years later, Ralph Bagley would be elected as Chairman of the Committee. Retrieved on 13 October 2008. In November 1875, Bagley and Benjemin Wright withdrew from John Marsden and Company to enable them to concentrate on their partnership with Samuel Milne.London Gazette, issue 24271, 30 November 1875, p6173. However, by 1877, the partnership with Samuel Milne had come to an end,London Gazette, issue 24418, 9 February 1877, p635 and Bagley and Wright were trading under the name 'Bagley & Wright' from the Wellington and Lees mills with Joseph Wright mill manager at the Wellington. From these mills they manufactured crochet, embroidery, tatting and bonnet cotton as well as sewing thread; the latter being a relatively new introduction to their line. They were also producing fishing-net twine something that they became known and respected over many years.Hosking's Guide to Manchester Trade, Section 2 Sewing Cotton Manufacturers, July, 1877Hosking's Guide to Manchester Trade, Section 14 Sewing Thread, Crochet, Embroidery, Tatting and Bonnet Cotton, Knittings and Mendings, July, 1877 The growth of the company had, up to 1877, been rapid and they now saw a commercial imperative to appear daily (not necessarily personally) at the Manchester Royal Cotton Exchange where the cotton market for Lancashire was based. Here spinners tried to get the best deals for raw cotton from the importers of American cotton while simultaneously getting the highest available price for their yarn from weaving businesses. While assisting in the development of the Bagley & Wright business, Joseph Wright was developing a business in his own right. Although Wellington Mill was by 1877 an integral part of the Bagley & Wright operations, it also provided the manufacturing base for a separate business called Travis, Freeman & Wright that was owned by Jakeh Travis, Thomas Freeman and Joseph. Like the Wright brothers, Jakeh Travis and Thomas Freeman were devout Wesleyans, so their meeting and partnership was not entirely happenstance. However, whereas Benjamin and Joseph were \\"new kids on the block\\", Jakeh was \\"old money\\", his family having been involved with the cotton industry from the early 19th century. Indeed, although he was involved in several enterprises, his input was financial rather than active. When he was elected to the Chadderton Board of Health his employment was listed as 'gentleman'; a clear indication that he did not need to work to maintain his income. By 1881, Benjamin's family employed an additional domestic help, a 20-year-old servant called Harriet Mills from Wolverhampton.1881 census returns, United Kingdom National Archives, Kew, London Having two or more domestic servants was the norm for cotton masters in Oldham at that time.The Cotton Masters, Howe, A., 1984, Clarendon Press, Oxford.  Consolidation ‚Äì 1880 to 1890  Over the period during which Bagley & Wright and Travis & Wright were consolidating the business, house construction struggled to keep abreast of the growth in worker numbers in Oldham. Most houses were in terraces aimed to provide workers with good sanitation and water supply. Although trams served many parts of the town, transport was still essentially by horse and carriage. For this reason, workers‚Äô houses had to be near to the place of work. Both Benjamin and Joseph lived in terraced housing until around 1875; the same sort of housing that would be used by their employees. This was considered normal and only the most affluent of mill owners might be expected to move into houses reflecting their level of income. In 1881, Benjamin was 43 years old and Ann was 40. Living in Ashton-Under-Lyne, they now had three more children; Frank (9-years), Ethel Mary (6-years) and Gertrude.(2-years) In 1871, Ralph had married1871 census returns, United Kingdom National Archives, Kew, London and by 1881, he and his wife Betsy had four children; Travis (9-years), Annie (8-years) Clara (3-years) and Elizabeth (3-months). Competition from other United Kingdom- based spinning companies as well as an increasing flow of imported yarn and finished cloth made it essential to secure supplies of raw cotton and markets for the spun thread.The English Cotton Industry and the World Market, 1815‚Äì1896, Farnie, D.A., Oxford University Press, 1979, . The Company responded to these market pressures by consolidating both the supply and demand side of the operation. By 1885 the Company had established an office in Liverpool so that it had a presence on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange to enable it to buy raw cotton at the lowest price. In 1886, Bagley & Wright bought out the business and trade mark of Messrs. William Clapperton who were sewing thread manufacturers in Paisley, Scotland. Around this time they also bought into other businesses including the Crooklands Bobbin MillCumbria Sites and Records Office, Kendal, United Kingdom, SMR number 6143 to secure their supply of bobbins, and a 'spooling mill' in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to prepare their sewing threads exported for the North American market and thereby avoid large import taxes introduced by the Canadian Government. The spooling mill premises also provided a facility for the storage of finished cloth made at their Wood Top and Cliviger Mills in Burnley.The Business and Professional Directory of All Cities in Ontario with Montreal, Quebec, Winnipeg, Halifax, St. John Sherbrooke and Hull, Published by The Union Publishing Company of Ingersoll, Canada, p203, 1902-3 In the latter half of the 19th century, profit margins in the spinning industry came under increasing pressure. In addition to the growing strength of workers groups like the Operative Cotton Spinners Association, competition from abroad was increasing due to the export of automated textile machinery; something that had been unlawful until 1843. The growth in overseas yarn production also caused shortages in the supply of raw cotton and this raised raw cotton prices, putting further pressure on margins. The Lancashire cotton trade suffered a series of depressions during which the relationship between workers and mill owners became strained. Workers were asked by the Master Cotton Spinners Associations to accept cuts in wages and when these requests were met with militant action by the operative associations the Masters introduced 'lock-outs' that were intended to put financial pressure on the operatives. In addition to short-term tactics like lock-outs, the Masters concluded that one way of controlling costs and income was to form syndicates with the objective of exerting better control over the market in which they operated. To a certain extent, Bagley & Wright had been at the forefront of this type of strategy by extending their business into the supply side. Belgrave Number 1 Mill (photographed in 2006) Throughout most of their existence, the company had manufactured fishing net twines, cotton yarn of all types (except the very finest threads) and high quality sewing threads. This latter product was especially successful and sales grew strongly during the 1880s. By 1881, the sewing cotton side of the business had grown to such an extent that it had been decided to build a new 'state-of-the-art' mill. The company bought land off Honeywell Lane, Oldham and erected Belgrave Mill which subsequently became known as 'Belgrave Number 1 Mill' as a further three mills were erected on the site in the early part of the 20th century. Yarn produced at the Belgrave Number 1 Mill was bleached or dyed in an on-site facility. Belgrave #1 was designed by the architects Potts, Pickup and Dixon a leading firm of mill architects in Lancashire. No expense was spared, including the fitting of a steam engine built by Woolstenhulmes & Rye. In addition to the Belgrave Mill, the company now owned Industry Mill, Crabtree Mill and Cliviger Shed in Burnley, as well as the other mills previously mentioned. By 1889, the Company had purchased a weaving mill at Cliviger near Burnley to provide an additional market for their yarns. In 1890 they increased this capacity by renting part of Wood Top Mill (also in Burnley). The success of the Company was reflected in a change of residence for both Benjamin and Ralph. Sometime between 1881 and 1891, Benjamin and Ann moved with their family to recently built houses on Queens Road, overlooking Belgrave #1 Mill across Alexandra Park. This change reflects the family's growing wealth and status within the community. Benjamin's home at number 53 was only a few doors away from number 67 where Ralph and his family had lived until moving to Edward Street, Werneth around 1890. Due to ill-health, Thomas Freeman withdrew from the Travis, Freeman & Wright business in September 1888. The business carried on with the remaining two partners under the title of Travis & Wright.London Gazette, issue 25856, 14 September 1888, p22.  Division and conglomeration - 1890 to 1900  By the late 19th century, the company had established a large warehouse and office block on Cannon Street in central Manchester and a second warehouse at the junction of Union Street and Priory Street in Oldham. There were branch offices in Glasgow and Belfast and offices and warehouses in Melbourne, Bombay and Moscow. In 1890 Bagley & Wright's occupied Wood Top Mill to further complement their weaving capability at Cliviger Mill. On 28 December 1892, a memorandumArchives of The Operative Cotton Spinners & Twiners' Provincial Association of Bolton and Surrounding Districts 1855‚Äì1973, John Rylands Library, Manchester University, United Kingdom, File Reference BCS1/5/3/40. was written by Ralph Bagley to 'J. Feilding Esq.' Secretary of the Operative Cotton Spinners Association (the spinners‚Äô trade union) informing him that a forthcoming meeting had been cancelled. The heading of the memorandum lists the company‚Äôs mills as: Wellington, Industry, and Belgrave in Oldham and Wood Top Shed in Burnley. In the archives of Burnley library is a reference written on Bagley & Wright notepaper in 1895 for a Mr. John Watson who ‚Äúhas been in our company for over five years as an overlooker & have always been found him a steady hand & competent workman‚Äù. The reference is signed by R. Sagar for Bagley & Wright. In 1895, the company's sewing cotton business was still expanding and a considerable investment was made in the extension of the Belgrave Mill to provide greater manufacturing capacity. In 1895 several British producers of sewing cotton yarn opened discussions on how they might combine their assets and markets to protect themselves from increasing competition from overseas. The companies decided to form a 'conglomerate' through which they would be in a better position to cooperate on the purchase of raw material and the combined marketing of their products. The aim was to cooperate rather than compete. Around 1893, the company bought a mill at Crooklands to secure the supply of bobbins that they needed. The bobbin mill at Crooklands lay between Milnthorpe and Kendal. The English Lake District was a major centre for the production of bobbins because of the availability of trees to use as the raw material and water courses to drive water wheels to power the machinery. The Crooklands Mill was built some time before it was taken over by Bagley & Wright who certainly owned it between 1894 and 1897. In 1906 the mill had passed into the ownership of Messrs. A. Bell and Co., so it is possible that the mill was retained by Bagley & Wright until after Benjamin's death in 1905. The Bobbin Mill made use of an old horse-drawn tramwayCumbria Sites and Records Office, Kendal, United Kingdom, SMR number 14002/14003 that passed closely by on an embankment. The tramway was originally built to serve a large gunpowder factory at nearby Gatebeck. The factory was owned by Wakefield and Co., one of the largest manufacturers of gunpowder in Great Britain in the 19th century. The tramway had horses pulling wagons of gunpowder from the factory to a wharf on the Lancaster Canal where it was dispatched to mines or to the military. The horses were shod in copper shoes so that sparks would not ignite the gunpowder. Before 1900, the tramway had been extended from the canal wharf to Milnthorpe where there was, by then, a railway station. In 1867, the Crooklands Mill had been powered by a water wheel with a mill stream taken off the nearby Peasey Beck.Cumbria Sites and Records Office, Kendal, United Kingdom, SMR number 1401 At this stage, the Mill consisted of about 3 buildings and bobbins must have been transported to the canal by horse and cart. By 1900, a spur line has been built from the tramway, across the Peasey Beck and into an open shed in the Mill grounds. There is evidence that the Mill stabled horses to be used in pulling wagons of bobbins onto the main tramway line and down to the canal or onwards to the station at Milnthorpe. In 1895 the Company's sewing cotton business was still expanding and a considerable investment was made in the extension of the Belgrave #1 Mill to provide greater manufacturing capacity. In 1897, fourteen companies involved in the spinning of sewing cotton combined to form the 'English Sewing Cotton Company Limited' (ESCC). In all cases, the Directors or Proprietors of each of the individual companies became Directors of ESCC. While some of the individual companies had previously only been involved with the manufacture of sewing cotton, Bagley & Wright had many other interests including yarn for weaving, fishing-net twine, crochet yarn etc. The Bagley & Wright business split into two; one part being subsumed into ESCC with Benjamin and Ralph as Directors, the other part staying independent. In effect, the ESCC was a 'holding company' and each of the fourteen companies within it maintained their own name and style of management. Wellington Mill (Lower Left), Belgrave Number 1 Mill (Lower Right), Industry Mill (Centre) and Wood Top Mill (Far right) from an 1895 Bagley & Wright Memo heading.Pamphlet LM31/BAG (MEM 1895, Cat:M0330123LC), Burnley Central Library Local Studies Department, Burnley, United Kingdom. The Belgrave #1 Mill was completely turned over to the manufacture of sewing cotton and was the Bagley & Wright 'contribution' to the ESCC. Bagley & Wright's other manufacturing activities were carried out in their other mills. From this point on, there are two listings for Bagley & Wright in the trade directories of the time. As an example, the 1901 Kelly's Directory of Oldham shows the following: (1) Bagley & Wright Limited, cotton manufacturers and doublers, Belgrave Mill, Honeywell Lane. (2) Bagley & Wright Manufacturing Co., cotton spinners and doublers; warehouse, Union Street; Wellington Mill, Wellington Street & Crabtree Mill, Bridge Street, Oldham Edge.Draper's Record, 18 September 1897, p617 In 1898, the ESCC made a decision to enter the American market by purchasing a number of New England mills in the USA. These acquisitions, including the Willimantic Linen Company were consolidated into the American Thread CompanyAmerican Thread Company Records, Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, University of Connecticut. Record identification: MSS19980302. . This purchase and consolidation was to have serious consequences for ESCC by 1902. Other than for the observation that Benjamin's sons had stayed at school longer than was the norm for less affluent families, the jobs that they took up after leaving school were relatively menial. In 1881, at the age of 18, his son Herbert had been a clerk within the Bagley & Wright business. Ten years later, in 1891, sons George Harrop Wright (21) and Frank Wright (18) were bookkeepers.1891 census returns, United Kingdom National Archives, Kew, London Perhaps the greatest deviation from the 'work from the bottom' idea was that the sons did not have to experience the manual jobs of piecing and spinning. Clearly, the aim was to provide the sons with experience of various positions within the business to prepare them for future ownership. Because the business was so extensive, other family members could also be brought in and groomed for future management. Thus, Henry, the eldest son of Benjamin's brother Joseph, was a clerk at Wellington mill in 1891 while his father was the proprietor of Travis & Wright at the same mill. By 1901, Joseph's second son Benjamin (we will call him 'Benjamin junior' to identify him from his Uncle Benjamin) was a warehouseman at Bagley & Wright's Union Street warehouse.1901 census returns, United Kingdom National Archives, Kew, London  Division ‚Äì 1900 to 1910  The ESCC operation hit stormy waters early in the 20th century. The investment that the company had to commit in forming the American Thread Company (ATCO) was much larger than originally estimated and returns were slow in materialising. The value of shares in the ESCC dropped sharply. An article in The Guardian newspaper in April 1902 noted that an extraordinary general meeting of the ESCC directors and shareholders was to take place on 23 April.The Guardian, 14 April 1902, p4. The purposes of the meeting were to (1) discuss the company's position in regard to its management and finances, (2) to enquire into the reasons for the loss of share value and (3) take steps to reorganise the Company Board to protect the Company from issues arising from its holding in the American Thread Company. The shareholders were concerned that a large amount of ESCC money had been placed in a reserve fund for the purpose of paying a dividend to shareholders. The problem, from the point of view of most shareholders was that the directors of the mills in the USA that had been bought out to form the ATCO had all been issued with large numbers of ATCO and ESCC shares as part of the consolidation. The effect was that share value had been diluted. Solicitors and accountants working on behalf of the shareholders stated that the use of a reserve fund for the payment of a dividend could be illegal under English law. Prior to this meeting, the ESCC Board consisted of 24 directors, all of whom were directors of the individual companies that had combined to form the holding in 1897 plus several directors of American companies. To improve management efficiency the meeting decided that the Board membership should be reduced to 12 with half of this number being ordinary shareholders unconnected with either the individual ESCC enterprises or the ATCO mills. From this point onwards, neither Ralph Bagley nor Benjamin Wright sat on the ESCC Board although they continued to own substantial share holdings in the ESCC. From the ESCC's perspective, the collection of firms that formed the basis of their operation was identified as being inefficient. Whenever there was a turndown in the market for sewing thread, the overheads due to running numerous mills, each with its own management and administrative structure, was a liability. By 1905, the company had decided that 'concentration' was required and steps were taken to reduce overheads and improve operating efficiency.Levy, H. Monopoly and Competition - A Study of English Industrial Organisation, Batoche Books, 2001, Ontario, Canada. In 1905, the year of Benjamin's death, Ralph Bagley was 66 years old. The English Sewing Cotton Company's Report of 25 July 1907 listed that the following results of 'concentration' were that (1) A linen thread mill was sold to round off the trust's sphere of business, (2) The production of the Egerton Mill was transferred, the report explaining that the trust 'had sufficient reserve productive capacity at other mills to enable them to deal with the trade conducted at that branch' and (3) The plant of the Belgrave Mill at Oldham was removed, and the site and buildings sold. Finally, 'a further concentration took place by the transfer of the business of R. F. & J. Alexander & Co., carried on at Duke Street, Glasgow, to one of the other branches of that company'. Contemporaneously with this policy of concentration, output was centralised by the connection of the ESCC with Messrs. Coats, and the system of common sales established in 1906 through a newly formed organisation called the Central Thread Agency. The net profits of the ESCC greatly increased following that step, though, for the most part, this was due to improved market conditions. The net trading profit for ESCC, which had been ¬£170,829 in 1904, and only ¬£92,614 in 1905, rose to ¬£254,846 in 1907 and was maintained in 1908 at ¬£251,938 although we have no record of the capital deployed. Oldham Family Records and Archives have records of those eligible for jury service around the turn of the 19th century. The records provide an interesting insight into the wealth of the people on the list because it gives the amount of money for which each person has been assessed to contribute to the Poor Rate of the Borough. Jurors had to be property owners because this was seen as a measure of responsibility. The entries for Ralph Bagley, Benjamin Wright and George Harrop Wright in 1903 show that Ralph Bagley carried a Poor Rate assessment of ¬£420 while Banjamin Wright was assessed at ¬£276. Both were identified as 'Special Jurors'.Oldham Jury List 1900‚Äì1904, Oldham Local Studies and Archives, Union Street, Oldham, United Kingdom. Being defined as a 'Special Juror' depended entirely on the amount that had been assessed for Poor Rate and this, in turn, depended on the wealth of the individual measured by the value of the property that they inhabited. In 19th century England and for several decades after the end of Victoria's reign, an Englishman of wealth and standing could, if required to defend him/her-self in a court of law, request that the jury was constituted from peers on the grounds that they would not be adversely prejudiced. Special Jurors were those who might be called upon to stand as jurors at such a trial. It was not until 1949 that this privilege of the wealthy and landed gentry was repealed. . Benjamin Wright died on 5 May 1905 at home on Queen's Street, Oldham. As befitting his status within the town, his funeral was in the finest Victorian tradition. A description of the cortege in the Oldham Chronicle on 9 May described the scene.Oldham Chronicle, 9 May 1905 After noting that the interment was at Green Acres cemetery in Oldham, the article lists the occupants of the nine carriages each 'drawn by two bay horses'. In addition to his widow and seventeen members of his close family, the cortege included Ralph Bagley and his wife, representatives of Trinity Wesleyan Church and major cotton industrialists from the town. In his will, Benjamin left a net estate of ¬£33,557High Court of Justice, Family Division, High Holborn, London (over ¬£13.28 m as a 2006 value using the average earnings indicator as the comparator. ) His will detailed his wishes that his private and business assets be formed into a trust for the benefit of his children and grand children. His widow and eldest son Herbert were trustees and Herbert was to take over the running of the Bagley & Wright Manufacturing partnership in place of his father. Jakeh Travis died in 1907 and the Travis & Wright business was formally dissolved in January 1908.London Gazette, issue 28102, 24 January 1908, p 34. Two years later, after the death of his wife, Joseph Wright retired. He was to live another 20 years.  Closure - 1910 onwards  After the sale of Belgrave Number 1 Mill by ESCC, the new owners built three new mills on the site. These were erected in 1907, 1910, and 1914 respectively. Number 3 Mill was the first in Oldham to be powered entirely by electricity. In 1919, Herbert Wright re-formed and consolidated the independent (non-ESCC) Bagley & Wright Manufacturing operation into a Limited Company (Bagley & Wright Manufacturing Company (1919) Limited). In 1924 this company was dissolved and the assets sold.London Gazette, issue 32969, 29 August 1924, p6528. Herbert died on 10 October 1934 leaving net personal assets of ¬£¬£27,509 (¬£5.08M in 2006). In 1927, Bagley & Wright Limited (the ESCC business) was still being quoted on the Oldham Stock Exchange. At this time, the business had 200,000 ¬£1 shares that were valued at 14 shillings and 9 pence. Its capital value was ¬£151,753 and 'loan owner' claims stood at ¬£123,568. Liabilities were ¬£56,918 and the profit and loss account showed a deficit of ¬£86,512.

He has published widely and is frequently invited to comment on his research at both academic and public policy forms as well as to give interviews to media outlets. In 2012, Katz was appointed the Feld Professor of Emerging Media at Boston University‚Äôs College of Communication. In addition, he directs its newly established Division of Emerging Media Studies and Center for Mobile Communication Studies. Prior to his appointment, he was professor and chair of the Department of Communication at Rutgers University, NJ, USA. Also at Rutgers University, in 2012, he received the highest honor that can be bestowed on one of its faculty members, the designation of Board of Governors Professor of Communication [need citation]. Preceding his tenure at Rutgers, Katz served as a Senior Scientist directing the social science research unit at Bell Communications Research (Bellcore) Telcordia Technologies. Katz has also taught at the University of Texas, Austin, where he also served as chair of the Austin World Affairs Council. He has also served term as editor-in- chief of Human Communication Research, a flagship journal of the International Communication Association. Since receiving his Ph.D. in Sociology from Rutgers University in 1975, he has published over 15 books on topics ranging from government and scientific policy to museums, mobile devices and the use of social media. His books have been translated into many languages including Italian, Spanish and Japanese. Along with Rutgers colleague Mark Aakhus he developed the concept of Apparatgeist, related to how people develop relationships with their technologies, and how they seek to find transcendental ways to communicate. His recently published Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies (2008) has been a top-seller in the category of Computer and Internet books on Amazon. The book consists of 32 edited chapters that discuss the range of mobile phone usage around the world, much of which was originally presented at a conference held at Rutgers University in 2005. His co-edited volume, Perpetual Contact, has been described by Work, Employment and Society as a 'collection [that] will promote further debate in fields concerning the social construction of technologies, communications and media.' In 2013, Katz published The Social Media President: Barack Obama and the Politics of Digital Engagement (Palgrave Macmillan, 228 pp.) with Michael Barris and Anshul Jain. The study examines the White House's use of Twitter and other online tools for policy initiatives and strategic campaigns since 1992, and in particular since 2009 during Barack Obama's presidency. The authors discuss the strengths and weaknesses of social media for public engagement, and concludes that its impacts in promoting the efficiency of democratic institutions have often been exaggerated. Drawing on interviews, case studies and social-media content, the book provokes academic and popular discussions about the successes, limitations and missed opportunities in the strategic use of social media in Obama's administration.

Peacock researched his story from early Welsh materials, many of them untranslated at the time; he included many loose translations from bardic poetry, as well as original poems such as \\"The War-Song of Dinas Vawr\\". He also worked into it much satire of the Tory attitudes of his own time. Elphin has been highly praised for its sustained comic irony, and by some critics is considered the finest Arthurian literary work of the Romantic period.  Synopsis  At the start of the 6th century Caredigion is ruled by king Gwythno Garanhir, and his subordinate Prince Seithenyn ap Seithyn is in charge of the embankments that protect the plain of Gwaelod in Caredigion from the sea. One of Seithenyn's officials, Teithrin ap Tathral, discovers that the embankment is in a poor state of repair, and tells Elphin, son of king Gwythno. Together they find Seithenyn, who is as usual drunk, and warn him of the dangerous state of the sea-defences, but he dismisses their fears with specious arguments. Elphin then meets Angharad, Seithenyn's beautiful daughter, and together they watch the onset of a mighty tempest, which destroys the embankment so that the sea breaks through. Seithenyn, with drunken bravado, leaps into the waves, sword in hand, but Teithrin, Elphin and Angharad make their escape to king Gwythno's castle. Gwythno is distraught at the submersion of the best part of his kingdom under Cardigan Bay. Elphin marries Angharad and settles down to earn his living from the produce of a salmon-weir he has constructed. One day he finds in this weir a coracle containing a baby, whom he names Taliesin and raises along with his own daughter, Melanghel. As Taliesin grows up he learns the precepts of Druidism and becomes a bard. Gwythno dies, and Elphin inherits the throne of the reduced and impoverished kingdom of Caredigion, but is soon abducted by Maelgon, king of Gwyneth. Maelgon's son, Rhun, visits Elphin's home and seduces a woman whom he believes to be Angharad, but who is actually her servant. Taliesin sets out to free Elphin at the prompting of his foster- sister, Melanghel, with whom he is in love. At Maelgon's court he announces himself as a bard of Elphin, vindicates Angharad's honour, and enters into a poetic contest with Maelgon's bards, in the course of which he warns him of various impending dooms, including an attack by King Arthur and death by plague. Taliesin returns to Caredigion. Rhun follows him, wanting to make a second attempt on Angharad, but he is lured into a cave and there imprisoned when a boulder is released to seal up the entrance. Taliesin sets out to find King Arthur in Caer Lleon. On his way there he stops at Dinas Vawr, a fortress just captured by king Melvas, whose men are celebrating their victory in wine and song; among them he is astounded to find Angharad's father, Seithenyn ap Seithyn, who it turns out survived the flooding of Gwaelod so many years before. Taliesin reaches Caer Lleon, admires its splendours, then gets audience of King Arthur, who is keeping Christmas merrily, even though his wife Gwenyvar has been abducted by person or persons unknown. He tells the king a secret he has learned from Seithenyn, that Gwenyvar is being held by Melvas; then he moves on to Avallon, where Gwenyvar is being kept captive, in the hope of negotiating her peaceful release. There he meets Seithenyn again, together with the abbot of Avallon, both of whom agree to help him. Together these three convince Melvas that he has more to gain by voluntarily releasing Gwenyvar to Arthur than by facing Arthur's wrath. Back in Caer Lleon Taliesin takes part in another bardic contest. Llywarch sings his \\"The Brilliancies of Winter\\", Merlin his \\"Apple Trees\\" and Aneirin his \\"The Massacre of the Britons\\", but Taliesin's contribution, a portion of the Hanes Taliesin, is declared the finest. Seithenyn and the abbot then make their entrance, bringing Gwenyvar with them, and having restored her to Arthur they tell him that Taliesin was instrumental in securing her release. The grateful king grants Taliesin a boon, and Taliesin begs that Arthur will command Maelgon to release Elphin. Maelgon himself makes his appearance at this point and unwillingly submits to Arthur's will. Arthur sends an emissary to fetch Elphin, Rhun, and all other concerned parties, including Melanghel. The story ends with Taliesin's marriage to Melanghel, and election as Chief of the Bards of Britain.  Composition  Angharad and Elphin find the baby Taliesin in a coracle. Illustration by F. H. Townsend (1897). Peacock's passionate interest in Welsh culture began many years before he wrote anything on the subject. In 1810‚Äì1811 he made a walking tour of Wales, returning three more times in the next few years, and he probably made use of his observations of the country in The Misfortunes of Elphin. He had a gift for languages, and is said to have taken his first steps in learning Welsh at this time. In 1820 he married a Welsh lady, Jane Gryffydh, who, it is supposed, either tutored him in the language or else acted as his translator. Certainly Elphin displays a knowledge of early Welsh materials, some of which were then unavailable in English translation. It is a reasonable surmise that his wife served as the model for Angharad and Melanghel. In 1822 he moved to a house in the village of Lower Halliford, Surrey, and it was here that Elphin was written. He chose to include 14 poems in his story, most of them being loose translations or adaptations of bardic poems by, among others, Taliesin, Myrddin and Llywarch Hen, though some, such as \\"The War-Song of Dinas Vawr\\", were original compositions. Elphin was published seven years after his previous book, Maid Marian (1822). It is possible that it had a long gestation because of the many other demands on Peacock's time, such as a full-time job at East India House and the work involved in serving as his friend Shelley's executor, and because his research was so assiduous, but it has also been argued that he did not begin to write it until late in 1827. The Misfortunes of Elphin was eventually published in March 1829.  Sources  Peacock's use of traditional and medieval Welsh-language sources was somewhat unusual in his time, when, outside Wales itself, they were generally thought unsuitable for use in works of literature. Though generally remaining true to their spirit, he reduces the role of the supernatural in these stories. The narrative structure of Elphin is based on three ancient tales: the inundation of Gwythno's kingdom through the negligence of Seithenyn, the birth and prophecies of Taliesin, and the abduction of Gwenyvar by Melvas. The first of these tales is told in a poem in the Black Book of Carmarthen, but was also available to Peacock in two English language sources, Samuel Rush Meyrick's History and Antiquities of Cardigan (1806) and T. J. Llewelyn Prichard's poem The Land Beneath the Sea (1824). The Taliesin story is told in the Hanes Taliesin. This was not available in full in the 1820s, either in English or in the original Welsh, but summaries and fragments of it were available in Edward Davies's The Mythology and Rites of the Druids (1809) and elsewhere. Peacock's version of the story of Arthur, Gwenyvar and Melvas derives ultimately from the 12th-century Latin Vita Gildae by Caradoc of Llancarfan, probably via Joseph Ritson's Life of King Arthur (1825). The poems scattered through Elphin are for the most part translated or imitated from originals published in Owen Jones's Myvyrian Archaiology (1801‚Äì1807). The Welsh triads Peacock quoted were available to him in translation in a journal called The Cambro-Briton (1819‚Äì1822), one of the major sources of his novella. The extended description of Caerleon owes much to Richard Colt Hoare's 1806 translation of Gerald of Wales's Itinerarium Cambriae and Descriptio Cambriae, but other topographical descriptions draw on Thomas Evans's Cambrian Itinerary and, probably, on Peacock's own memories of his various Welsh holidays.  Satire and humour  Quite apart from being a historical romance The Misfortunes of Elphin is also a sustained satirical attack on contemporary Tory attitudes. Gwythno's dam stands for the British constitution, Seithenyn's speech disclaiming any need to repair it echoes various of George Canning's speeches rejecting constitutional reform, and the inundation represents the pressure for reform, or alternatively the French Revolution. Peacock also makes numerous ironic comments about the blessings of progress, and in his portrayal of the \\"plump, succulent\\" abbey of Avallon he attacks the over-comfortable clergy of the Church of England. Other targets of his satire include industrialization, the doctrine of utilitarianism, realpolitik, pollution, paper money, false literary taste and the Poet Laureateship. These attacks on the follies of his own times do not, however, lead Peacock to idealize his medieval characters by contrast. Arthur is less than distraught at his wife's absence, Gwenyvar is no better than she ought to be, Merlin is a secret pagan whose supposed magic is merely natural philosophy, and such human frailties are seen as driving history. Human nature, for Peacock, was imperfect in very similar ways in all periods of history. The appeal of The Misfortunes of Elphin for the modern reader depends largely its unusual blending of an Olympian irony with simple good humour. The result has been described as \\"comic genius of the highest order\\". J. B. Priestley analysed the stylistic devices which help to produce this effect: The comic and ironic invention of the novel is seen at its finest in the character of Seithenyn, \\"one of the immortal drunkards in the literature of the world\\", as David Garnett described him. He is \\"a Welsh Silenus, a tutelary spirit of an amiable and approachable type\\", whose conversational style, with its alcoholically twisted logic, has led to his being repeatedly compared to Falstaff. He is perhaps Peacock's greatest character. Priestley devoted a whole chapter of his English Comic Characters (1925) to Seithenyn, and criticism of Elphin has mostly focused on him, though Felix Felton argued that he is only one of a trio of characters on whom the work really rests, the others being Taliesin and Elphin.  Reception  The reviews of The Misfortune of Elphin were almost wholly appreciative. The Edinburgh Literary Journal, reviewing another work, may have referred to Elphin as \\"a very unintelligible book\\", but the Literary Gazette called it \\"one of the most amusing volumes which we have perused for a long, long time\\". The Cambrian Quarterly Magazine thought it \\"the most entertaining book, if not the best, that has yet been published on the ancient customs and traditions of Wales\\". The Radical Westminster Review was, predictably, more amused by the ridicule of Tory sentiments than by Peacock's sideswipes at Benthamism and political economy. A brief but laudatory notice in the New Monthly Magazine found the satire to be almost as effective as Swift's. The Athenaeum, though it found a falling-off from Peacock's previous novels, could nevertheless recommend it to \\"every person who can relish wit, humour, and exquisite descriptions, as a work of a very superior class to the popular novels of the day\\". In spite of this critical praise sales of The Misfortunes of Elphin were disappointing. Copies of the first edition were still being remaindered 40 years later, and though Peacock's other novels were all reissued in 1837 and 1856, Elphin was not. In the 20th century critics were agreed in preferring The Misfortunes of Elphin to Peacock's other historical romance, Maid Marian, and many considered it the finest of all his novels. Among these were Robert Nye, who wrote that it shows \\"Peacock at the height of his powers...a demigod on a spree\\", and A. Martin Freeman, who thought it \\"perhaps the completest statement of his point of view\\", showing Peacock \\"at the summit of his achievement...absolutely at his ease, a master of his subject and of English prose\\". Bryan Burns thought that \\"as a piece of story-telling which mingles celebration with attack, a subdued but trenchant treatment of themes of authority and individual freedom and an admirable achievement of style, it is hard to equal in the rest of Peacock's oeuvre.\\" Marilyn Butler considered it \\"his very best strictly political book ‚Äì and that is to place it high among political satires in English\\". J. B. Priestley declared that \\"to read it once is inevitably to read it again\\". On the other hand, Carl Dawson felt that the contemporary references, though they made the book relevant to Peacock's contemporaries, dated the book for later readers: \\"Elphin is a type of novel that has to be rewritten for each generation. Its equivalent in our own day is perhaps T. H. White's The Once and Future King.\\" The Misfortunes of Elphin is sometimes said to be one of the few English works of genius to have been inspired by the 19th-century Celtic Revival. Peacock studied his early Welsh sources with respect for their vigour, sense of wonder, hyperbole and inventiveness with language, and is said by favourable critics to have evoked their spirit vividly while tempering them with \\"Attic lucidity and grace\\". On the other hand unfavourable critics have disparaged his choice of Welsh rather than English or French sources for his Arthurian story. James Merriman, for example, thought it a \\"minor work\\" precisely because of its use of \\"distinctly inferior materials\\". There is not total agreement between critics as to the narrative skill displayed in Elphin. Bryan Burns wrote of \\"the insouciance and diversity of its story-telling...there is real command in the spacing and contrasting of episodes, the organizing of space and the economy and poise of individual scenes\\", while Marilyn Butler judged that of all Peacock's books Elphin has the strongest plot, but Priestley on the contrary believed that \\"he has no sense of narration, of the steady march forward of events, of the way in which action can be ordered to produce the best effect\\". One of his objections was that \\"the action is continually held up by the songs, of which there are far too many\\". The critic Olwen W. Campbell agreed that these \\"long and tedious adaptations of bardic songs\\" interrupted the story, but Bryan Burns, while objecting to the \\"mannerly loftiness\\" Peacock shared with other minor poets of his period, thought these songs served a useful purpose in the story as outlets for romantic sentiment and local colour. There is wide agreement that the original poems in Elphin are superior to the translations and imitations, and that \\"The War-Song of Dinas Vawr\\", later taken up and adapted by T. H. White in The Once and Future King, is the best of them.

The action begins during a house-party in the nouveau riche Mr. Crotchet's villa on the Thames (up- river from London), continues during a river and canal journey towards Wales, and ends in Mr. Chainmail's pseudo-medieval dwelling (near Crotchet's villa), with a parody of the Captain Swing riots.

Overview The novel first appeared in Fraser's Magazine in 1860, showing a remarkable instance of vigour after his retirement from the East India Company. The exuberant humour of his former works may be wanting, but the book is delightful for its stores of anecdote and erudition, and unintentionally most amusing through the author's inveterate prejudices and pugnacious hostility to every modern innovation. The book's title turns about the belief of its owner, Gregory Gryll, 'though he found it difficult to trace the pedigree, that he was lineally descended from the ancient and illustrious Gryllus, who maintained against Ulysses the superior happiness of the life of other animals to that of the life of man.' This sapient character was one of the men whom Circe had turned into pigs and resisted being changed back. His family line had now lasted some three thousand years, but the master of Gryll Grange, not having married, was without an heir to prolong the family. Though he had adopted his niece as heir instead, she had turned down innumerable suitors. The business of the novel is how she at last comes to find a man to her taste.The annotated text of the novel is on the Gutenberg site The plot The novel begins with a discussion around the dinner table of Mr. Gryll, in which his friend, the genial gourmet, the Rev. Dr. Opimian, holds forth on misnomers, fish, and the contemporary fashion for lectures. Mr. Gryll suggests that they get up an Aristophanic comedy to put on show that Christmas, in which spirit-rappers bring up the shade of his supposed ancestor, Gryllus, to give them his opinion of modern times. On a walk in the adjacent woods one morning Dr. Opimian discovers that an abandoned tower known locally as \\"the Duke's folly,\\" is now inhabited. The new owner, Mr. Algernon Falconer, overhears the divine (who has a mania for quoting from the ancients) quoting a passage from Homer comparing the tower to Circe's enchanted abode. Himself a lover of classical literature, Falconer invites the divine to dine with him. Mr. Falconer, a young bachelor, is attended by seven young women, all sisters, who serve as cooks, waitresses, and music-players for him all at once. At first slightly disturbed, Opimian finds that his new friend is simply a genial eccentric who wishes to avoid the world in order not to discompose the equanimity of his mind; and who spends his days reading and contemplating \\"ideal beauty\\" in the form of a shrine to St. Catherine, a Christian martyr of the third century. Opimian repeats his visit to Mr. Falconer several times, and at one point encounters a local farmer's son, Harry Hedgegrow, who is in love with one of the seven sisters of the tower. When, on a later visit, a carriage bearing Mr. Gryll and his young daughter Morgana is hit by lightning near the tower, Falconer invites them in, and first forms Morgana's acquaintance. After a much prolonged stay at the tower while the latter is recovering, Gryll invites his host to stay with him during Christmas and be present at the comedy. At Gryll Grange (Mr. Gryll's estate) a wide and pleasant circle has gathered for the Christmas celebrations. Aside from the Grylls, Dr. Opimian, and Falconer, are the slightly ludicrous but amiable lord Curryfin, who is a dabbler in all kinds of science and technology, Miss Niphet, and the spinster Miss Illex. Lord Curryfin (who has made his name as a lecturer on fish) is in search of matrimony, and initially courts Morgana. However, she does not strongly encourage him, and he begins to find himself attracted to Alice Niphet (who accidentally manifests her own interest in him when he endangers his life during the holiday season in various shenanigans, such as experimenting on a new type of sail, and undertaking to tame a stubborn horse). Meanwhile Falconer admits to himself that he has fallen in love with Morgana, but hesitates to propose to her out of unwillingness to break up his congenial household with the seven sisters at the tower. Harry Hedgeworth pursues his suit to Dorothy the \\"Vestal\\" (as the seven sisters are called throughout the novel) of his choice, and six of his friends each fall in love with another of the girls. He presents this fact to Mr. Opimian, who undertakes to forward the loves of Morgana and Falconer so the seven sisters can marry. Morgana, seeing Falconer's hesitation, gives him an ultimatum whereby she hints he must either declare his love 28 days thence, or renounce her forever. At the same time, seeing Lord Curryfin and Alice Niphet's mutual attraction, she forces the former (on the claim of his having been her suitor) to declare himself to Miss Niphet. He accedes, and is accepted. The Aristophanic comedy is finally performed; Gryllus is called up by Circe at the behest of the spirit-rappers; the spirit-rappers ask Gryllus his opinion of modern times, but he is dismissive of engine-ships, locomotives and everything they can tell him of; a competitive examination (a practice begun in Peacock's time, which he strongly opposed)\\"The Oxford Companion to English Literature\\", ed. Mrgaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 1985. is arranged for various characters, who are all declared unfit by the examiners for failing to answer some irrelevant questions. It is then revealed that they are Hannibal, Oliver Cromwell, and Richard the Lion-Heart. The latter chases the examiners away with his battle-axe. At the close of 4 times 7 days Falconer proposes to Morgana. Dr. Opimian having told him of the mutual love of the seven sisters and Harry and his friends, his fears on that score have been removed. The novel ends at a ceremony where all nine marriages are celebrated.

The company used a membership-based platform for financing film projects. The company served high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. Following the failure of its only two films, several investors sued IndieVest and Bradley for fraud. The company went dormant in early 2012, and in July 2015, Bradley told investors that he had begun \\"winding down\\" IndieVest.  Business plan  The company used a membership-based platform for financing film projects. The company served high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. Members paid a fee of either $2,950 or $4,950 yearly along with a 10% syndication fee. Members were given film pitches to choose from, with a minimum investment of $50,000. IndieVest documents promised investors a full return on investment, plus a preference payment of 15%. IndieVest stated that investors were to be paid out before the company profited. Film productions IndieVest Pictures, a subsidiary of IndieVest, started production on their first film, Saint John of Las Vegas, in August 2008. The film is a buddy comedy featuring Steve Buscemi, Romany Malco, Sarah Silverman, and Tim Blake Nelson. Filming took place in New Mexico and Las Vegas. Saint John was released in January, 2010. The film received $21,666 in its opening weekend at #50 and reportedly the domestic box office receipts totaled just over $100,000. The film received mostly negative reviews, with a 17% rating with 6 \\"fresh\\" ratings and 30 \\"rotten\\" on Rotten Tomatoes. Chris Nashaway of Entertainment Weekly called the film \\"Excruciatingly awful\\" and \\"a shaggy road movie to nowhere\\". In July 2010, IndieVest started filming a second movie, Knights of Badassdom, an American comedy horror film, directed by Joe Lynch, written by Kevin Dreyfuss and Matt Wall. The film was shelved and significantly re-cut by Bradley; Lynch later stated that this was a violation of their contract. On March 4, 2013 updates reported that the film was screened March 5, 2013 to potential buyers in Los Angeles. On July 25, 2013, it was announced that Entertainment One had bought the North American distribution rights to Knights of Badassdom with Wade Bradley negotiating the deal for IndieVest Pictures.  Investor suits  On July 23, 2013, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) settled a regulatory complaint against Wade Bradley, who provided a statement of mitigating circumstances and neither admitted nor denied the findings . The penalty was a thirty-day suspension associating with any FINRA-member organization, and a $7,500 fine (payable if he re-registers with a FINRA firm).FINRA Disciplinary Proceeding #2011025780101 In 2013, several IndieVest investors launched an arbitration filing with FINRA against IndieVest and Bradley seeking $1.6 million to be returned to them. The investors alleged that Bradley illegitimately withdrew their funds from escrow despite the fact that the minimum amount had not been reached to break escrow. Bradley stated that he had believed that the minimum amount had been reached at the time he withdrew the funds. The investors alleged that Bradley's company Media Society, founded in late 2012 about seven months after IndieVest became dormant, was a successor entity that should have borne IndieVest's liabilities. Bradley responded that Media Society was a separate entity and not connected to IndieVest. In fall 2013, Comen VFX, a visual effects company, was awarded $119,649 in an arbitration judgement against IndieVest, after it was found that IndieVest had not paid for work performed on Knights.

It takes a lighthearted view of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos to inspire laughter rather than the more usual soul-blasting horror. The comic was used as the basis of the second expansion set to the Cthulhu Mythos themed version of Steve Jackson Games' card game Munchkin.\\"Munchkin Cthulhu 3 - The Unspeakable Vault\\". Steve Jackson Games. Retrieved 2008-09-01. The webcomic's name is often shortened to UVoD. Origin In 2003 the Essen Game Fair in Germany, the author, who was there signing books for the Pegasus Spiele game publisher (as illustrator of the German Call of Cthulhu RPG), witnessed the craziness about Cthulhu plushes, sold on different booths: many old players of the Call of Cthulhu role-playing games wanted to buy this icon of the Lovecraftian Mythos. On the train that took him back to Paris, he started drawing the first funny Cthulhoo and Nyarly draft, along with a few layout of strips. Characters were designed in a very cartoonish style, with simplified features and layout, that contrast strongly with the author's illustrations style, more realistic and classical. The name of the webcomic comes from the juxtaposition of a very Lovecraftian adjective \\"unspeakable\\" with the name \\"Vault\\", a Lovecraft's short story title. \\"of Doom\\" was used by the author's role-playing team to describe threatening spells or items. Although its author is French, the webcomic is written directly in English, to be able to reach the largest audience, and because the English language is more direct and uses fewer words; this sometimes leads to grammatical or syntactical errors in the strips, which are often corrected by emails from native English-speaking readers. The webcomic Presented in different formats (mostly 1- or 3-frame strips, sometimes more), short gags are published irregularly on the website, and are named \\"Vault #\\" followed by a number, since its creation in January 2004. Strips are independent, though some gags are running on a few linked pages. Some strips refer to previously published gags, and can be difficult to understand for newcomers. The characters' appearance has changed a bit since 2004, becoming more precise and balanced, but some recently published strips shows old-looking creatures: the strips are not published in a rigorous chronological order, and sometimes a gag is taken from the book Welcome to the Vault. The webcomic uses the Cthulhu Mythos and its caricatured characters in a modern environment, referring to the common popular culture and actuality, and even politics; ecological matters can also be seen through a few strips dealing with pollution and overfishing. The vision of the Cthulhu Mythos in the comic is heavily influenced by the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game; Fran√ßois Launet discovered HPL's works through gaming, and many strips directly refers to the game, its rules, its accessories and the players' habits. The website also features a weblog, used to talk about Mythos-related events or item, a guest art section to display drawings done by fans and a small shop selling T-shirts. The website is hosted by Macguff Paris, a special FX and post-production company, which employs Fran√ßois Launet as a SFX supervisor, and allows him to use some of their disk space and broadband access. The printed books In 2005, Fran√ßois Launet and Pegasus Spiele agreed on the publication of a printed version of the UvoD, under the supervision of JC.Steines, and Paul McLean from yog-sothoth.com for the editing part. Featuring most of the strips published at that time on the web, along with original gags, Welcome to the Vault () was a 105-page, comic-sized book, printed in an edition of 4000 copies and sold on the US by White Wolf and Chaosium. The books were not officially distributed in Europe and are, therefore, very difficult to find. A second tome, G.O.O.s on the Loose () was published in 2008, featuring a lot of new characters, such as Cthoogha, the Elderz or Beta Red Agents. Mythos-related characters Most of the characters in the comic are given names slightly different from their counterparts in the Cthulhu Mythos. right (Great) Cthulhoo Cthulhoo (Cthulhu) is a large, green, dragon-like creature with huge claws on his feet, beady eyes, tiny arms, almost vestigial wings (still capable of flight\\"Vault #19\\".

Apparently, the whole point of black magic is to feed Cthulhoo, since he usually eats anyone who, deliberately or accidentally, summons him. Cthulhoo also commonly uses the phrase \\"Fhtagn!\\", in the manner of an expletive. If \\"Fhtagn\\" is mispronounced as \\"FTHagn,\\" Cthulhoo comes anyway, but lectures the summoner on how to say the word - before eating him (or her). right Nyarly Nyarly (Nyarlathotep) is what appears to be a tentacle with a pair of beady eyes, a single large tooth sticking out of his mouth, and short arms and legs. He has a deceptive and cunning personality and enjoys playing tricks on the other GOOs and cultists.

He is often ripped apart by an invisible force, like in Lovecraft's \\"History of the Necronomicon\\". Mad Abdul makes two appearances in the webcomic but is more important in the UVoD volume 2 book. Musicians According to the musical tastes of the author, Metal and Gothic band members are shown overusing Mythos imagery in their lyrics, with disastrous consequences. When he eats them, Cthulhoo does not like the excessive amount of hair they have. Discworlders Several strips reference the famous books by Terry Pratchett in various ways; characters included on occasion have included Rincewind (along with Twoflower's animate \\"Luggage\\"), the Grim Reaper (who falls afoul of Lovecraft's line \\"With strange aeons, even Death may die\\"), and even Sir Terry himself, who is one of several influential artists to be eulogized in the UVOD. Appearances in popular culture Recent editions of the Munchkin card game by Steve Jackson Games have included Lovecraftian characters; in January 2008, an edition with 56 Unspeakable Vault character cards was added to the collection. In October 2008 PS Games released the Dutch translation of Munchkin Cthulhu, as Munchkin Koethuloo, which includes an extra card featuring the Tindaloos. Pegasus Press has produced a board game based around the comic.\\"Kartenspiel erschienen bei Pegasus Spiele in Deutsch\\" (in German). Pegasus Press. February 10, 2008. Retrieved December 28, 2009. In 2006, futurist Anders Sandberg noted the Unspeakable Vault (of Doom) as an example of the trend of poking fun at formerly horrifying concepts.

War Production Board (c. 1942 ‚Äì 1943). \\"The best defense is a good offense\\" is an adage that has been applied to many fields of endeavor, including games and military combat. It is also known as the strategic offensive principle of war. Generally, the idea is that proactivity (a strong offensive action) instead of a passive attitude will preoccupy the opposition and ultimately hinder its ability to mount an opposing counterattack, leading to a strategic advantage. Military George Washington wrote in 1799: \\"‚Ä¶make them believe, that offensive operations, often times, is the surest, if not the only (in some cases) means of defence\\".https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/06-04-02-0120 Mao Zedong opined that \\"the only real defense is active defense\\", meaning defense for the purpose of counter-attacking and taking the offensive.The best defense is a good offense Often success rests on destroying the enemy's ability to attack. This principle is paralleled in the writings of Machiavelli and Sun Tzu.The best defense is a good offense Some martial arts emphasise attack over defense. Wing chun, for example, is a style of kung fu which uses the maxim: \\"The hand which strikes also blocks.\\" The \\"German\\" styles of Historical European martial arts favor the offence (The Vor slac) to open the fight or defencive techniques that is also an offence (eg. Abzetsen). During World War I, Germany planned to attack France so as to quickly knock it out of the war, thereby reducing the Entente's numerical superiority and to free up German troops to head east and defeat Russia. Games In some board games, such as Risk, one's ability to build up armies depends on aggressively attacking so as to acquire territory; however, in Risk, luck in rolling the dice is the ultimate determining factor. Players who fail to do so, and concentrate instead on holding the line against enemy attack, will likely end up in a weak position. In-depth info argues that this adage does not always apply: \\"When the battle rages between two players one should put every ounce of power in the offense, but when several players are involved, the political element changes this dynamic.\\" In chess, one's ability to prevent enemy attacks often depends on maintaining the initiative - i.e., making a series of threats that the opponent must use his turns to parry, rather than launching his own attacks; thus, common tips used in conjunction with this adage are that the best way to upset your opponent's plans is to become menacing and that the best way to stop an enemy threat to your own king is to attack his. In sports such as football and basketball,The best defense is a good offense the adage is used to note that success can hinge on an effective offense that keeps the ball on the other team's side of the field, thus not only creating scoring opportunities but preventing the opposing team from scoring. Business The adage has also been applied in the intellectual property realm, in reference to patent trolls. Law The adage has also been applied in court where the defense counsel attacks and breaks the prosecutor's case. It is the prosecution's burden to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. There are strict rules of criminal procedure code which require the prosecution to first prove a prima facie case, before the defense could be called or even invited to set out material aspects of its position, and the prosecution's task to present its case at the trial.

It lies approximately north-west of Sejny and north of the regional capital Bia≈Çystok. History The first mention dates from 1684. The village used to belong to Sztabinki's property, which in the eighteenth century disintegrated into several estates. Farm with the village and Gryszka≈Ñce and Staszkuny acquired in the eighties of this century from Mateusz (eng. Matthew) Narzymowski czesnik Owrucka Province - Maciej Tadeusz Eysmont of Krasnohruda (Krasnogruda). In those days the village was founded estates ≈Åumbie Ber≈ºynie and ≈ªag√≥wiec which occurred near Inn. In 1832, when the inheritance was divided after Eysymont, ≈Åumbie property received Petronela Paszkiewiczowa of Eysymont family, then belonged to Bronis≈Çawa Paszkiewicz√≥wna, married to Mejer. At the beginning of the twentieth century passed into the Dochowie's hands. Their last owner, Henryk (eng. Henry), who knew twelve languages, having a sound agricultural and horticultural education, gained in England and France, failed to retain 172 hectares. Property was taken over Earth's Credit Society, and Doch settled in part of the property belonging to his wife. This part of the land he sold after the war.Baturowa Irena, Przewodnik turystyczny po Ziemi Sejne≈Ñskiej, Landmarks At the junction of highways is a monumental, stone chapel, and further, on the left shoulder for the catchment of milk, there is a last recorded Doch's seat, and with her pretty clay barn, erected after the war. At the next corner is located an old manor house, which until recently was in elementary school. Today it is private property. This is an interesting building - a small, half-clay, half of wood, decorated with shaped porch. In 1977 in the village was carried out archaeological research, as a result of which were found remains of settlements wzesno≈õredniowiecznej: Resource traces of pits, fragments of pottery, including clay span and a ring made of bronze.

The department arose by renaming the MO5(g), which was renamed MI5(g) in 1916. The MI5 itself, working under Vernon Kell, had a number of India experts at the beginning of the war. In September 1916, a special section, the MI5(d), section was formed to operate counter-espionage networks throughout the British Empire. Another subsection, the MI5(b), was formed in January 1917 to deal specifically with Indians and \\"other oriental races\\". The MI5(g) had 27 officers in its staff, eight of whom had served in India before the war. Among them were ex-Indian civil servants including Robert Nathan and H. L. Stephenson. The main emphasis of this counter- espionage network was to prevent the subversion of Indian troops in the European theatre. The organisation, especially under Nathan, worked closely with the Special Branch of the Scotland Yard in Britain and with the Indian Political Intelligence Office headed by John Wallinger, which operated a network of spies in neutral Switzerland which a number of the Indian revolutionaries and members of the Berlin Committee used as a base. MI5(g)'s work at the time identified the plans by Ghadar Party and the Berlin Committee to assassinate Lord Kitchener in 1915 through an associate of Har Dayal, Gobind Behari Lal. It was also responsible at this time, along with Basil Thomson, for the capture of Harish Chandra (who was associated with the Berlin Committee) and turning him into a double agent. Through Harish Chandra was also identified plans for obtaining information of Ghadarite intrigues in Japan and China. Among other works, Nathan was responsible for the plans made by British intelligence in late 1915 to assassinate Virendranath Chattopadhyaya through an agent by the name of Donald Gullick.

In ancient past, it was called bunong by the Tagalog people. It is essentially a diminutive form of the larger kalis or kris. The gunong serves both as a utility knife and as a thrusting weapon used for close quarter fighting‚Äîusually as a last defense. It is most often associated with the Maranao, among whom the gunong was traditionally carried by both sexes, although it exists in other cultures throughout Mindanao and the Visayas. The weapon is generally tucked into the back of a waist sash. The gunong is one of many bladed weapons portrayed in the \\"Weapons of Moroland\\" plaque that has become a common souvenir item and pop culture icon in the Philippines. It is also known as punyal (also known as pu√±al de kris or kris knife) among Visayans and the Yakan people; and badao among the Lumad people (which also applies to the balarao daggers).  History  T'boli and Mandaya badao daggers with sheaths in the National Museum of Anthropology The gunong is a dagger variant of the kalis, a Philippine sword derived from the Indonesian kris dagger. The gunong is most commonly found in the ethnic groups of Mindanao. The tribes carried blades as part of their regular attire, both as a precaution for self-defense and for accomplishing daily tasks. While the gunong dates back centuries before colonial times, it became more prevalent in 1915 when General John J. Pershing issued an order outlawing the wearing of swords. Now unable to carry traditional machetes or broadswords, people turned to the gunong to fill the gap without arousing the fears of the American colonial authorities. Around this time, the gunong became larger and was crafted with a pistol-grip handle rather than the old straight hilts. More extravagant fittings with chased bands on scabbards, belt clips, guards, and bulbous ferrules also became common. After World War II, thinner-bladed gunong were made from newer materials like nickel and aluminium. The name punyal may be traced to pu√±al, the Spanish word for \\"dagger\\".  Anatomy  As with its larger relative, the kris or kalis, gunong can be either straight or wavy- bladed. The blade may be single or double-edged and broadens towards the hilt to protect the bearer's fingers. The sheath and the handle can be made from either wood or metal. The style of the hilt can be used to differentiate modern pieces from those made before the American occupation.

Hackett took a series of jobs as a clerk in a law firm, for the advertising department of Cosmopolitan Magazine, and literary editor of various periodicals, such as the Chicago Evening Post. In 1906 Hackett moved into Hull-House and taught English to Russian Immigrants. As writer and critic, Hackett attacked Chicago‚Äôs genteel and commercial cultures, racism, and the subordination of women. He left his position as literary editor of the Post in 1911 to pursue a career as a novelist. Hackett died on 25 April 1962.

The Type 38 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 38th year of Emperor Meiji's reign (1905).War Department TM-E-30-480 Handbook on Japanese Military Forces September 1944 p 400 History and development Type 38 75 mm field gun at Base Borden Military Museum Although Japan had extensive experience with artillery, as the result of its war with Russia in 1904-05,Neuffer(British) General Staff, p. 106 & 117 and had the technology and industrial infrastructure to construct medium or large caliber naval weapons prior to World War I, planners at the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff turned to Krupp in Germany, for the latest trend in artillery design. Initial units of Krupp 7.5 cm Model 1903 were imported, and then eventually over 2,000 units, which were designed \\"Type 38\\" in Japan, were produced under license by the army‚Äôs Osaka Arsenal.Meyer, The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan. page 97 The original Type 38 gun had a conical interrupted screw, a single box type trail which limited gun elevation to only 16¬∞30'. Also, there were no equilibrators as the trunnions were at the gun barrel's center of balance. All of these shortcomings were remedied with a redesign following World War I.US Department of War Special Series No 25 Japanese Field Artillery October 1944 After World War I, these weapons were considered largely obsolete. However, by this time, Japanese production capabilities had improved, and the Type 38 underwent a re-design in Japan to improve the carriage, with a corresponding increase in elevation, range and rate of fire to 10-12 rounds per minute.US Department of War. TM 30-480, Handbook on Japanese Military Forces Design The Type 38 75 mm field gun was a thoroughly conventional design for its day, complete with crew seats on the gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and a 1/16-inch gun shield. Side view of the improved Type 38 with an inset shot of the breech At some point prior to the Second Sino-Japanese War (sources differ as to when) the Type 38 was extensively modified. The piece was trunnioned forward and equilibrators were added to compensate for muzzle heaviness. It was given a hollow box trail that allowed elevation to 43¬∞. The new version was called the \\"improved Type 38\\". Some 400 units were produced in Japan, and it is unclear exactly how many Type 38s were upgraded to the improved version. However, both types were still in service in limited numbers by the start of World War II, despite efforts to replace the design with the Type 90 75 mm field gun. The Type 38 75 mm field gun (improved) was capable of firing high-explosive, armor-piercing warhead, shrapnel, incendiary, smoke and illumination and gas shells.Bishop.

Plot Soraya is a young trainee nurse who is starting to feel disaffected by her life. A chance introduction to the world of glamour piques her earlier ambition to be a star. She does not succeed at first, but she is told that the forbidden practice of susuk can help. She has to make a choice whether to stay the way she is, or cross the line. At first, susuk seems to give her confidence in her performance, and even to stand up to her abusive brother-in-law. Meanwhile, Suzana is a prominent diva with an air of mystery. She has long been a practitioner of the black arts due to her use of the extreme susuk keramat. Every time she violates a taboo, a human life is required - first in the form of accidental deaths of her loved ones, then by outright murder and cannibalism. She develops inhuman, supernatural abilities. At the same time, she yearns for her more innocent days and hires a young assistant who reminds her of \\"happier times\\". A mysterious and powerful dukun guides the two women down their paths to corruption. The viewers follow the lives of these two women until their stories converge in the true secret of this dreaded charm.

It aims to provide a firm basis for policy and practice in the country's rapidly changing environment by conducting in-depth, on-the-ground research. Funding is provided by a variety of governments and agencies. AREU office in Kabul History In 2000 the Strategic Monitoring Unit (SMU) was established in Islamabad by the Afghan Support Group,http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/01/443&format;=HTML&aged;=0&language;=EN&guiLanguage;=enPain, Adam. Understanding and Monitoring Livelihoods under Conditions of Chronic Conflict: Lessons from Afghanistan. London: ODI, 2002, p. 2 to improve emergency response by ensuring that lessons learned from similar situations around the world were analysed and disseminated (at that time Afghanistan was largely under Taliban rule). The SMU produced two papers: a report on the northern province of Badakhshan.,http://lccn.loc.gov/2006334106Badakhshan (Islamabad : SMU, 2001). and a review of the Strategic Framework for Afghanistan Mark Duffield, Patricia Gossman, and Nicholas Leader, ‚ÄúReview of the Strategic Framework for Afghanistan‚Äù (UN Strategic Monitoring Unit: Islamabad, Pakistan, 2001). Cited in Humanitarian Action and the Afghanistan Crisis Issues Note for NGO Policy Dialogue X, November 15, 2001, Humanitarianism and War Project, Feinstein International Famine Center After the toppling of the Taliban government in late 2001, the SMU was renamed the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU) and given a new mandate. In early 2002 it moved to Kabul. About Our Work AREU's research addresses the complete spectrum of actors in Afghanistan, from remote communities to officials at the highest levels of government. Involving rigorous, qualitative fieldwork across a range of provinces, it provides a unique insight into many of the social, economic and political dynamics at work in the country today. Projects range from multi-year investigations of national development issues to short-term responses to priority topics as they arise. Sample of Recent Projects AREU's research focuses on areas and issues of importance to policy makers. Current research themes are: governance, gender, livelihoods and human security, natural resource management, political economy and markets.AREU‚Äôs Annual Plan for 2008https://www30.a2hosting.com/~areuorg/index.php?option=com_docman&Itemid;=26&task;=doc_download&gid;=583 Natural Resource Management (2010‚Äì12): An integrated project on rural water management and opium poppy cultivation in the provinces of Helmand, Nangahrar, Balkh and Badakhshan. The research aims to investigate how the River Basin Management (RBM) model is progressing in the EU-supported Panj-Amu River Basin Management Programme (P-ARBP) and the prospects of its replication in other river basins in Afghanistan. It also seek to facilitate the achievement of rural livelihood security and stability in Afghanistan by exploring the dynamics of the opium economy in the 2010-11 growing season and beyond. Women's Participation in Development (2012): The research examines the various assumptions that justify the ‚Äúgender-inclusive‚Äù development initiatives of some of the national development programmes and the micro-finance institutions. It particularly examines the assumption that women‚Äôs participation in community organisation or development projects at the community level serves to ‚Äúempower‚Äù them as individuals and as a group. It also explores what motivates and enables women to participate in these different programmes and what limits their participation. Finally, it provides an analysis of the different models and methods being used by facilitating partners involved in different national development programmes, and how these impact women‚Äôs ability to participate and the effects of such participation. Communicating our Research AREU actively disseminates its research, which is always made publicly available and free of charge. Publications: All AREU publications are available online and in hardcopy, with many translated into Dari and Pashto. These range from in-depth provincial case studies to peer- reviewed policy briefs and professionally published reports. Updated each year, the A to Z Guide to Afghanistan Assistance aims to enhance general understanding of the array of actors, structures and government processes related to aid and reconstruction efforts in the country. The guide provides: a wide-ranging glossary of assistance terms, an overview of Afghanistan‚Äôs system of government, a series of country and city maps, key primary documents, and an extensive contacts directory that includes government agencies, NGOs, donors, and international actors. The latest version will be published early 2013 and will contain a dedicated section to the transition period. When the first edition of the A to Z Guide was published in 2002, the goal then‚Äîas it is now‚Äîwas ‚Äúto provide a guide to the terms, structures, mechanisms and coordinating bodies critical to the Afghanistan relief and reconstruction effort to help ensure a shared vocabulary and common understanding.‚Äù Over the years the guide increased in scope and size, but has always followed the same successful model. Events and briefings: AREU regularly convenes events such as public seminars, roundtable discussions and press conferences. Meanwhile, staff frequently provide private briefings to Afghan and international policymakers. Library An important complement to the research and publications of AREU is the library. Since the formation of the unit, statistical publications, NGO reports, policy papers and similar materials have been accumulated and indexed in the AREU Library on-line bibliographic database (built using Greenstone open source software). The library is open to the public and collaborates with other libraries in Kabul to collect and make available publicly documents of research value on Afghanistan.Camins-Esakov, Jared. 2008.

It constitutes one of the largest stonefly families, containing some 300 species distributed throughout the holarctic. Their closest relatives are the rolled-winged stoneflies (Leuctridae). Many species are endemic to small ranges, perhaps due to the family's tendency to evolve tolerance for cold (isolating populations in mountain valleys) and winglessness (inhibiting dispersal). Indeed, some wingless Capniidae - e.g. the Lake Tahoe benthic stonefly (\\"Capnia\\" lacustra, Capnia is not monophyletic and this species is suspected to belong elsewhere) or Baikaloperla spp. - spend their entire lifecycles under water and do not disperse from their native lakes at all. Description and ecology Adult Capniidae, as their common name implies, are typically small Plecoptera; while most are less than 1 cm long with some measuring just 4 mm as adults, a few are as large as at adulthood. The adults emerge from the water in winter and are often found walking around on the snow. Characteristic are the wings with at most one cubital crossvein, and the paraprocts (anal lobes), the inner lobes of which form a tube closed on the underside by the outer lobes. Nymphs of small winter stoneflies typically have very elongated and slender bodies, similar to those of Leuctridae. However, the groove along the abdomen, from segment 1 to 9, is generally very pronounced. The nymphs dwell in the hyporheic zone, the interface between stream water and groundwater. Only immediately before moulting into the adult form will the nymphs move out of the substrate and appear on the stream bed. Thus, although they may be plentiful in clean rivers and streams, they are seldom encountered in standard samples of benthos. Systematics and taxonomy The family Capniidae is often considered to be monotypic as to subfamily, with the Capniinae being inserted at that rank. However, this is rather pointless; in any case, the phylogeny, systematics, and taxonomy of the small winter stoneflies are highly confused. There appear to be two very basal genera and presumably two larger clades which conceivably could be considered subfamilies, but the phylogeny of the Capniidae is by no means robustly resolved, with about one-third of the named genera of uncertain position. Hence, any subdivision beyond the generic level is premature. The type genus Capnia has generally been considered polyphyletic. Three new or resurrected genera have recently been created, partially or wholly, from some of its species: Arsapnia, Sierracapnia, and Zwicknia. In addition, seven Capnia species were previously included the genus Bolshecapnia when it was elevated from subgenus to genus, and three of those species were placed in the new genera Eurekapnia and Sasquacapnia in 2019.

It lies approximately south-east of Mielnik, south-east of Siemiatycze, and south of the regional capital Bia≈Çystok. The village has a population of 240. The history of Niemirow probably dates back to the 11th century, when a Slavic gord existed here. Archaeological findings proved that both Mazovian and Ruthenian settlers resided here. First documented mention of the village comes from 1495; at that time, it was called Niwice. In 1548, King Zygmunt August handed the village to a nobleman Stanislaw Niemira (Gozdawa coat of arms), whose grandson, Castellan of Podlasie Stanislaw Niemira, changed the name of the village into Niemirow and granted town charter to it. In 1620, a market square with a parish church were built, and Niemirow was first called a town in documents from 1631. Swedish and Transilvanian invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660) had catasthrophic consequences for the town, as it was completely destroyed, and in 1662 its population was only 88. The town remained property of the Niemira family until 1738, when it was purchased by the Czartoryski family. Due to efforts of Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1755 Niemirow was granted the right for two weekly markets and two annual fairs. In 1795 - 1807, borders of the three partitioning powers met near the town. In 1815 - 1915 Niemirow belonged to the Russian Empire, and on February 4, 1863, a skirmish between Russians and Polish rebels took place here, during the January Uprising. According to the 1921 census, the village was inhabited by 777 people, among whom 557 were Roman Catholic, 71 Orthodox, and 149 Mosaic. At the same time, 591 inhabitants declared Polish nationality, 54 Belarusian and 132 Jewish. There were 120 residential buildings in the village.Skorowidz miejscowo≈õci Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej: opracowany na podstawie wynik√≥w pierwszego powszechnego spisu ludno≈õci z dn. 30 wrze≈õnia 1921 r. i innych ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç urzƒôdowych., t.

In September 1939, Soviet authorities forced most residents to leave the town, as Soviet- German border was established nearby (see Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact). The inhabitants returned to the town in mid-1941, after German invasion of the USSR. Niemirow, almost completely destroyed during the war, lost town rights in 1944. Due to the wartime destruction, the village has few points of interest. Niemirow, a former town, has a market square, with some wooden houses. Also, there is St. Stanislaus church, originally built in 1620 to burn down in 1775. New church was built by the Czartoryski family in 1780 - 1791. In 1866, Russian authorities closed it, and unsuccessfully tried to convert it into an Orthodox church. It was given back to the Catholics in 1905. Niemirow also has a gate with a bell tower (1823), and near the village there is the so-called Castle Hill, with a medieval gord, which once guarded Bug river crossing. Furthermore, there are concrete bunkers, which were part of the so- called Molotov Line, built by Soviets in 1940-41.

History  The church was established in 1804, and the building was completed in 1812. In 1808, while the congregation was still holding services at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, members helped start a church in Smyrna in Wilkes County. In 1925 the Ladies' Foreign Missionary Society already was collecting donations, making it the first such ministry in the world, according to the statistics of the church. During his childhood, United States president Woodrow Wilson's father, Joseph R. Wilson, was minister at First Presbyterian from 1858 to 1870. The Woodrow Wilson Boyhood Home is a historic site nearby. In 1861 the Church hosted the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States and the first minister in this new denomination was President Wilson's father. During the Civil War the building was used as a hospital for men wounded, and the churchyard was a detention camp for Union prisoners in the Battle of Chickamauga. Men who died were buried in the Magnolia Cemetery. During this time Joseph Wilson was called to the chaplain ministry in the army, and in 1870 Wilson was called to serve at a seminary in South Carolina. Westminster Day School was started in 1972. The campus of Westminster Schools, located on Wheeler Road, now has more than 500 pupils, grades K‚Äì4 through 12. First Presbyterian Church started a missions conference, and the annual event is a combination retreat and workshop for missionaries and their families. It also is an opportunity for the people of Augusta to hear about work in the field. In 1973, First Presbyterian dropped its affiliation with the Southern Presbyterian Church over issues, such as the authority of scripture and the role of women in the church, and became independent. It aligned itself with the Presbyterian Church in America in 1977.  Church building  An old picture from the congregation Later the church served as a center of social and religious activities during World War I and World War II. It was designed by architect Robert Mills in the Romanesque style. Mills was also Presbyterian, and was an elder in the First Presbyterian Church in Columbia, SC. The church sanctuary was built in 1809‚Äì12. The church was finished and dedicated in 1812 in Classical style. The church was significantly changed in 1847 to incorporate Romanesque round- arched windows and doors and crenellated parapet walls. Mills' design, however, is still evident in the shape and scale of the historic building. A plaque marks the Wilson pew in the sanctuary. A letter signed by President Wilson and some furniture used by his family when they lived in the manse were installed in a classroom. Four halls on the sides and rear of the sanctuary were added to the building from 1951 to 1978. On February 21, 1997, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, listed as First Presbyterian Church of Augusta. The church celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2004  Doctrine  First Presbyterian Church is a member congregation of the Presbyterian Church in America. It adheres to the Westminster Confession of Faith, Westminster Shorter Cathechism and Westminster Larger Catechism. The church has about 1,900 members. The lead pastor is Rev. Michael K. Hearon.

A few hours after an insurgent IED ambush which damaged Polish wheeled armored vehicle (KTO Rosomak), a patrol of Polish soldiers from the elite 18th Airborne-Assault Battalion taking part in the International Security Assistance Force opened heavy machine gun and 60 mm mortar fire at the area of the village. The attack resulted in the deaths of six civilians, including a pregnant woman and three children, and seriously injured three other women. Incident According to the military report D9 161030z of the Afghan War Diary, the patrol fired 26 mortar rounds, of which three landed in a compound where a wedding celebration was taking place. The villagers stated that there was no shooting coming from the village when the mortars were fired there, while the Polish soldiers stated that they had fired a machine gun at four people near the village, who in turn fired back. The villagers stated that the Polish soldiers should have come to the village to ask for information regarding Taliban fighters planting of IEDs, since the villagers were opposed to Talibs' operations near their village. That evening and the following day, the Provincial Reconstruction Team and Polish soldiers planned \\"consequence management\\", including contact with the villagers, gifts of food and supplies, the purchase of a goat for the villagers as a goodwill gesture, and regular visits to the village in order to build \\"trust and rapport with the villagers\\". Families of the victims were later paid compensation, while the injured Afghans were flown to be treated for their wounds in a hospital in Poland. In result of the action eight innocent civilians including a pregnant women and children were killed.

Six of them (accused of killing civilians), if found guilty, would face a penalty of 12 to 25 years in prison to even life imprisonment, while another one (accused of opening fire on an unarmed target) faced up to 25 years in prison. According to a spokesperson for the Court, \\"It's a unique trial, not only in Poland but also in Europe or even in the world.\\" Nevertheless, the case was given little attention in foreign media. The trial began in February 2009. In May, Polish Minister of Defense Bogdan Klich gave testimony in which he called the incident \\"a mistake\\", citing the opinion of the commander of the U.S. forces in the area. The soldiers have also gained support from many military officers and celebrities, including General S≈Çawomir Petelicki, the founder and first commander of the Polish special forces unit GROM. On June 1, 2011, the Warsaw District Court acquitted all seven soldiers for lack of evidence of deliberate killing. The court described the case as unprecedented in the history of the Polish military and judiciary. The prosecution has the right of appeal against the verdict.  Re- trial  Poland's highest court opened a new trial for seven Polish soldiers in 2012. Prosecutors said that they are convinced that war crimes were committed. The first ruling \\"should not stand,\\" prosecutor Jan Zak said. In 2013 the trial was still in court, especially the cases of ppor. (lower OF-1 Nato code rank) Bywalec, chor. (OR-8 Nato code) Andrzej Osiecki, plut. rezerwy (OR-4 higher, but reserve status - \\"rezerwy\\") Tomasz Borysiewicz and Ligocki, were sent to be examined by the Supreme Court, because there were doubts about their \\"innocent\\" status. Re-trial ended on March 19th, 2015. In February 2016 the Military Chamber of the Supreme Court in Warsaw (Poland) stated that they did not commit a war crime, but were guilty of negligently carrying out orders. The ruling upheld the decision of a military court from March 2015. Three Polish soldiers were given suspended jail sentences, while the case of one was conditionally discontinued.

The term originated from the name of the equipment (\\"steppers\\") that exposes the photoresist to light. Integrated circuits have two primary classes of mask sets: firstly, \\"base\\" layers that are used to build the structures, such as transistors, that comprise circuit logic and, secondly, \\"metal\\" layers that connect the circuit logic. Typically, when an integrated circuit manufacturer such as Intel or AMD produces a new stepping (i.e. a revision to the masks), it is because it has found bugs in the logic, has made improvements to the design that permit faster processing, has found a way to increase yield or improve the \\"bin splits\\" (i.e. create faster transistors and thus faster CPUs), has improved manoeuvrability to more easily identify marginal circuits, or has reduced the circuit testing time, which can in turn reduce the cost of testing. Many integrated circuits allow interrogation to reveal information about their features, including stepping level. For example, executing CPUID instruction with the EAX register set to '1' on x86 CPUs will result in values being placed in other registers that show the CPU's stepping level. Stepping identifiers commonly comprise a letter followed by a number, for example B2. Usually, the letter indicates the revision level of a CPU's base layers and the number indicates the revision level of the metal layers. A change of letter indicates a change to both the base layer mask revision and metal layers whereas a change in the number indicates a change in the metal layer mask revision only. This is analogous to the major/minor revision numbers in software versioning. Base layer revision changes are time consuming and more expensive for the manufacturer, but some fixes are difficult or impossible to accomplish with metal-only changes. The Intel Core microarchitecture uses a number of steppings, which unlike prior microarchitectures not only represent incremental improvements but also changes to features, such as a different cache size or the addition of low- power modes. Most of these steppings are used across brands, typically involving features being disabled or clock frequencies being reduced on low- end chips. Steppings with a reduced cache size use a separate naming scheme, which means that CPU steppings are not necessarily released in alphabetic order of stepping.

One may distinguish side letters from \\"side settlements\\" or \\"settlement agreements\\", which settle a dispute arising from the underlying CBA.United Steelworkers of America v. Cooper Tire & Rubber Company, 474 F.3d 271 (6th Cir. 2007). In rare cases, bargaining parties may use a side letter to adjust the focus of the contract if the parties are not yet ready or willing to adapt the contract formally.Kaboolian, Linda, and Sutherland, Paul. Win-Win Labor-Management Collaboration in Education: Breakthrough Practices to Benefit Students, Teachers, and Administrators. Bethesda, Maryland: Education Week Press, 2005. . Under the law of contracts, a side letter has the same force as the underlying contract. However, the courts may invalidate side letters in conflict with the main collective bargaining agreement.\\"Eighth Circuit Invalidates Side Letter Agreement Conflicting With Collective Bargaining Agreement\\". Benefits & Compensation Legal & Legislative Reporter. October 2004; Trustees of the Graphic Communication International Union, Local 1B Health and Welfare Fund \\"A\\" v. Tension Envelope Corporation, 374 F.3d 633 (8th Cir. 2004). The terms of the CBA govern interpretation of side letters. In the United States, several appellate courts have held that in disputes where side letters do not contain conflict resolution procedures, the parties must use the underlying collective bargaining agreement's dispute resolution mechanism (in these cases, arbitration) to resolve the dispute.United Steelworkers v. Trimas Corporation, No. 07-1688 (7th Cir. July 3, 2008).Dube, Lawrence E. \\"Court Orders Arbitration on Neutrality Pact, But Says NLRB May Have to Decide Legality\\". Daily Labor Report. September 10, 2007. The range of issues side letters covers is wide. In some cases, side letters have driven national labour law policy. For example, in the United States, a side letter guaranteeing employer neutrality during union elections in newly acquired plants, subsidiaries, or divisions led to a federal lawsuit over the legality of the agreement in 2002 and a major decision by the National Labor Relations Board revising federal labour policy in 2007.Int'l Union v. Dana Corp., 278 F.3d 548 (6th Cir. 2002); Gross, Jared S. \\"Recent Developments: International Union v.

March 3, 2008; \\"NLRB 3-2 Modifies Recognition Bar\\". U.S. Law Week. October 9, 2007. In Australia, side letters are becoming increasingly common due to the changes in federal labour law the WorkChoices Act created. WorkChoices limits the collective bargaining agreements that parties can register for eligibility for workplace tribunals enforcement, and also requires CBAs be strictly limited to work-related issues. The inclusion of even minor non-workplace-related clauses (such as dues check-off) can render a CBA unenforceable. In response, many unions and employers are using side letters to reach agreement on non-workplace-related matters, and not registering these side-letters with the federal government‚Äîrelying on common law to enforce the side letters.Stewart, Andrew and Riley, Joellen. \\"Working Around WorkChoices: Collective Bargaining and the Common Law\\".

It was captured by the Israel Defense Forces during Operation Hiram at the end of October. After a short fight, most of population fled into the countryside. The following day the local IDF commander allowed them to return to their homes. This was one of the few occasions when villagers were allowed back into their villages after they had left.Morris, 1987, p. 228 In January 1949 some villagers from Mi'ilya were expelled to Jenin, they complained of being robbed by Israeli soldiers whilst being deported.

By 1179 the castle had apparently been rebuilt, as it was then called Castellum Novo. In 1182, Baldwin IV granted the castle to his uncle, Jocelyn III. At this time it was called \\"The new castle in the mountains of Acre\\".Strehlke, 1869, pp. 13-15, No. 14; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, pp. 162-163, No. 614, cited in Pringle, 1998, p. 30 By 1187, the castle fell to Saladin, but was soon back in Crusader control. In the 1220, ownership passed to the Teutonic Knights. However, the importance of the castle of Mi'ilya was by this time superseded by the Montfort Castle. The Arab geographer, Al-Dimashqi, noted the \\"fine castle\\", and that close to it was a very pleasant valley, where musk-pears and large citrons were grown.Le Strange, 1890, p.495 Victor Gu√©rin found in 1875 that ‚Äúon the highest part of the hill we remark the remains of an ancient fortress, flanked by four square towers; considerable portions remain, showing that it was built of regular blocks, some levelled plane and some embossed; the latter were reserved for the angles.

Playing primarily in a full-back position, he won five Connacht Senior medals and two All-Ireland medals. Fahey‚Äôs intercounty career began in 1992 when he joined the Galway panel after playing a role for the Sigerson Cup winning UCG team. Se√°n √ìg De Paor was captain that year when the Galway college defeated Queen's University Belfast in Pearse Stadium, Galway. Fahey made his debut in the summer of 1992 when he came on as a substitute in a defeat against Mayo in Castlebar. It wasn't until 1995 that Galway finally won the Connacht title under Bosco McDermott. They defeated Mayo in Tuam Stadium: their first provincial title in 8 years. Galway narrowly lost to Tyrone in the All-Ireland semi-final. Mayo defeated Galway in both the 1996 and 1997 Connacht campaigns where they also lost both subsequent All-Ireland finals. John O'Mahony, who had brought Connacht titles to both Mayo and Leitrim, was announced as the new Galway manager in September 1997 after Val Daly's sole year in charge. The Mayo native then presided over what was to be a glorious period in Galway football with Fahy a central cog in the team. In the 1998 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final, the team defeated Kildare in the All-Ireland final to end 32 years of anguish. Gary Fahey played at full-back that day and his tussle with Kildare‚Äôs Karl O'Dwyer was a feature of the final. Their 1‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì06 win was the catalyst for a strong season for Galway, who followed up with victories over Leitrim, Roscommon in the Connacht final and Derry in the semi- final. Fahy had soldiered on the panel for six years before that All-Ireland victory and in the next 4 year‚Äôs he would play in some of the biggest games in Galway's history. In 1999, a hamstring injury kept him out of the Connacht Final. He returned for the 2000 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship season where Galway re-claimed the Connacht title after defeating Leitrim before losing to Kerry in the All-Ireland Final after a replay. According to Fahye, \\"The 2000 final was the one that got away because we had the chances at the end of the first game to take the title.\\" Galway began the 2001 championship season with a defeat to Roscommon. However, through the new 'back-door' system, they embarked on a run of victories over Wicklow, Cork, Armagh, Roscommon (again) and Derry before meeting Meath in the All-Ireland final. Galway beat Meath in the final by nine points to make up for the previous year against Kerry and in the process Fahey collected his second All- Ireland medal. He also had the honour of lifting the Sam Maguire trophy as captain. Galway won the Connacht title again in both 2002 and 2003 but fell short when it came to All-Ireland glory.

Webster (February 18, 1819 ‚Äì January 18, 1875), was an American songwriter and composer most notable for his musical compositions during the antebellum and American Civil War periods of United States history, and his post-war hymns. Amongst his most notable works are the ballad \\"Lorena\\" (1857), often considered the most popular song of the American Civil War (on both sides), \\"I'll Twine 'Mid the Ringlets\\" (written in 1860 and later known as \\"Wildwood Flower\\") and \\"In the Sweet By and By\\" (1868), one of the best-known Christian hymns in American history. Life and works J.P. Webster was born in Manchester, New Hampshire on February 22, 1819. From an early age he expressed an interest and talent in music, and went on to study with distinguished composers such as Lowell Mason and George James Webb, including a three-year course of study beginning in 1840 in Boston. Afterwards he travelled extensively throughout the Eastern United States as a concert singer, including notable stays in New York City and Madison, Indiana, where he performed with the famous \\"Swedish Nightingale\\" Jenny Lind, as her pianist. After years of travel, Webster eventually settled in Racine, Wisconsin. Sometime before 1859 Webster developed what was commonly called \\"Lake Michigan Throat\\", a severe form of bronchitis, forcing him to abandon his singing career and move himself, and by then a wife and children, farther south and away from the lake to Elkhorn, Wisconsin. No longer having the strength in his voice for singing, Webster turned his attention to composing music. This was a passion that would produce over 1,000 songs, including music for ballads, hymns, patriotic drama, and a cantata. During the Civil War years Webster taught and composed a variety of songs related to the war. He also participated as a drill sergeant for the Elkhorn \\"Wide Awakes\\", whose role was to act as the local home guard. As the war began to close, Webster returned his focus to writing ballads and hymns. About this time he also opened what was considered a \\"respectable saloon\\", which attracted young literary men of the town with which he would have future musical collaborations. One of these young men was Sanford Fillmore Bennett, who would later write the lyrics for \\"In the Sweet By and By\\". Webster remained in Elkhorn until his death on January 18, 1875, at the age of 56. He is buried at the Hazel Ridge Cemetery in Elkhorn, where his epitaph reads, \\"Joseph P. Webster. In the Sweet By and By We Shall Meet\\".

The Institute aimed to advance, refine, and share research that applied the tools of economic analysis to real-world issues. The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor, Milton Friedman, who is widely recognized for his many enduring contributions to economic analysis. The institute was a collaboration of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Department of Economics, and Law School and fostered inquiry across a wide range of topics and subfields. The institute aimed to advance and preserve the unique University of Chicago economic tradition of combining theory and data in rigorous analysis‚Äìan approach exemplified by Friedman and others. The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in subfields of economics, business, law, and related fields such as public policy and medicine. It hosted workshops, seminars, and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields. The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post- doctoral students, as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students. When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008, University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create \\"a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world.‚Äù The university had initially planned to invest $200 million in the institute, with half of that in the form of an operating endowment; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations. The institute was an object of intense controversy at the university, as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after Friedman, who was viewed as \\"polarizing\\". The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university, who argued that to found such an institute would constitute \\"a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University\\" and that the proposal reflected \\"a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics, not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involved in the study of 'economy and society'\\". In June 2011, the institute and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory were joined to form the new Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics.
