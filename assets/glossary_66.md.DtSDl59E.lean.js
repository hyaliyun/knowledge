Biography Baldwin was the chief vassal of Joscelin II, Count of Edessa. He controlled the city of Marash (modern Kahramanmara≈ü) and the strategic fortress of Kaysun. Baldwin‚Äôs fiefdom was in the northern border region of the Crusader states where the population was largely Armenian Christians. The chronicler Gregory the Priest says that Baldwin was the brother of Raymond of Antioch and therefore the son of Duke William IX of Aquitaine. Baldwin's Armenian confessor, Barsegh, has left us a funeral oration in honour of Baldwin which praises him for his military skill, bravery and charm but criticises him for his ‚Äúinnumerable, endless and merciless injuries and blasphemies‚Äù.The Crusades and the Christian World of the East: Rough Tolerance - Christopher MacEvitt - University of Pennsylvania Press - pages 94-97 In 1135, Leo I, Prince of Armenia seized Sarventikar from Baldwin of Marash. Sarventikar was a fortress on the slopes of the Amanus Mountains. In 1136 Raymond of Antioch attacked Leo I‚Äôs Armenian Kingdom in Cilicia. Baldwin of Marash marched with the Antiochenes. However Baldwin‚Äôs overlord, Count Joscelin II of Edessa, Leo‚Äôs nephew, helped the Armenians defeat the Antiochene army. After the battle, Baldwin convinced Leo to meet him. At the meeting Baldwin seized him and sent him off to Antioch as a prisoner.A History of the Crusades: Part 2 The Kingdom of Jerusalem - Steven Runciman (Penguin) - pages 201-202 That same year the Turkic Danishmends briefly captured Marash but the city was retaken by Crusader forces the following year. In October 1146, Baldwin accompanied Joscelin on an expedition attempting to recapture the city of Edessa from the Muslims who had conquered the city two years earlier. They entered the city but could not take the citadel before Nur ad- Din, atabeg of Aleppo surrounded Edessa with a large force. In a desperate situation Baldwin and Joscelin undertook a sortie at night. The following day Nur ad-Din caught up with them and a battle ensued in which the Christians were defeated. Count Joscelin managed to escape, however Baldwin of Marash died on the field of battle.A History of the Crusades: Part 2 The Kingdom of Jerusalem - Steven Runciman (Penguin) - page 240 References Category:Christians of the Crusades ","title":"Baldwin of Marash"},{"id":"45292682","text":"Bernard \\"Bernie\\" Miller is the founder and Pastor of New Covenant Fellowship Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Parker returned to NXT in July 2013 with a new hippie character, beginning a feud with Tyler Breeze that saw the two trading wins over several months. Although intended to be a fan favorite, Parker's hippie gimmick was largely unpopular and he was turned heel for the first time in his WWE career as a result on the February 12, 2014 edition of NXT, berating the fans for not getting behind him, calling them \\"Sheeple\\", and blaming them for the growing issues with the environment. He would tweak his character to that of an eco-warrior who berated fans for damaging the environment. Parker beat Tye Dillinger in January 2014 but was then largely unsuccessful, losing to main roster stars like Antonio Cesaro, The Miz and The Great Khali as well as a defeat by Mojo Rawley at NXT Arrival.

This would lead to Moxley issuing a challenge for Robinson to face him in a No Disqualification match for the IWGP United States Championship at King of Pro- Wrestling. However, Moxley was unable to defend his championship due to travel issues and was subsequently stripped of the title. Instead, Robinson faced Lance Archer at the event for the vacant title, but lost.

Finlay and Robinson went on to reform FinJuice and competed in the 2019 World Tag League.

Recording Boogie Woogie Country Man was a return of sorts to the more \\"hardcore\\" honky-tonk country albums that Lewis had recorded in the late sixties and early seventies, although producer Jerry Kennedy retained the background singers to sweeten Jerry Lee's increasingly slurred rasp. The heavy-handed \\"countrypolitan\\" production that had drenched albums like 1972's Who's Gonna Play This Old Piano...Think About It, Darlin' and 1973's Sometimes a Memory Ain't Enough is scaled back to an extent as Lewis rocks it up on the title track and turns in typically soulful performances on \\"I'm Still Jealous of You\\" and Tom T.

As a child, Iconika's upbringing was very reserved and traditional, she attended a small private Christian school where her grandfather was pastor and her grandmother a local English teacher, as well as attending ballet classes at Hawthorn Dance Academy until a late age. Growing up, Iconika was also banned from listening to musicNostro, Lauren (February 12, 2012) Who Is Phlo Finister? Complex and discovered her early tastes and passion for music through classical music and gospel music, as well as developing her distinctive vocal style at a young age from her time spent as a singer for the choir at her grandfather's church. This exposure to these styles also helped Iconika develop her taste in music, with some of her earliest influences being Jerry Bock, Mozart and Billie Holiday She attended Downtown Magnets High School in Fashion for a single year until her mother relocated to South Central, Los Angeles and she was enrolled in Crenshaw High School. Speaking of her time at Crenshaw, Finister described it as \\"very aggressive... Not mixed or diverse cultures like where I had come from.

However, her time working as a stylist for Def Jam was short lived as she believed lacked the \\"desperation\\" necessary to be successful in the profession.

This species is found in the Indo-Pacific where its distribution ranges form the Red Sea to Australia and Japan. The dotted grouper may grow up to 70‚Äì80 cm length. It is a demersal fish found at 70‚Äì300 m depths. Description The dotted grouper has a body which has a standard length which is around three times its depth. The dorsal profile of the head is a little convex as is the area between the eyes. The preopercle is serrated and projects at its angle where the serrations are enlarged. The dorsal fin contains 11 spines and 14-15 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 8 soft rays. The membranes between the dorsal fin spines has deep indentations and the caudal fin is moderately rounded. There are 57-70 scales in the lateral line. This grouper has a pale brown to greenish-grey body marked with irregular lines of small dark spots on the flanks and upper body. In some individuals there is a wide dark band running from the eye to the gill cover and two thinner bands running obliquely over the cheek. This species has a maximum total length of , although around is more common, and a maximum weight of . Distribution The dotted grouper is found in the Indo-Pacific region. It has a discontinuous distribution which extends from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the coast of East Africa off Eritrea, Kenya, Zanzibar and off southern Mozanmbique and KwaZulu-Natal as well as northwestern Madagascar. In Asia it is found in the Persian Gulf, off India, Indonesia, the South China Sea and southern Japan. In the Pacific it occurs off Papua New Guinea and Australia, although it is absent from the Philippines. It has been recorded in Malaysia. Habitat and biology The dotted grouper prefers deeper waters at depths of and is found over rocky and sandy substrates. Taxomony The dotted grouper was first formally described as Serranus epistictus in 1842 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck (1778-1858) and his student, the German ichthyologist Hermann Schlegel (1804-1884), with the type locality given as Nagasaki. There are some differences in counts of lateral line scales and in the size of the spots and their distribution in fish from the Indian Ocean compared to those taken in the Pacific Ocean. Utlisation The dotted grouper is fished for by artisanal and commercial fisheries in Asia. Influence The dotted grouper is one of the many known and commonly found grouper species in Cebu, Philippines, where it is given the term Kinsan. Dotted groupers are plentiful in the waters off the coast of Aloguinsan, Cebu. The town's economy, which heavily revolves around fishing, is dependent on most of its catch from the dotted grouper. The town itself was named after the local term of the fish, which the natives thought was the head of the dotted grouper or Ulo sa Kinsan that the Spaniards were referring to, upon which the Spaniards identified the kingdom as \\"Aloguinsan\\". As a form of thanksgiving for the abundance of the said grouper fish and as a movemen for eco-tourism, the town established a festival named after the dotted grouper. The Kinsan Festival has since become an official festival of Cebu. It is celebrated on the feast of the town's patron saint, St. Raphael the Archangel, on the 29th of September, in line with the Feast of the Archangels.

He is a recipient of three Silver Stars, and is the author of Abandoned in Hell: The Fight for Vietnam's Firebase Kate. Early life William Albracht was born and raised in Rock Island, Illinois. In 1966, he graduated from Alleman High School. Career =Military= At 21 years old, Captain William Albracht was the youngest Green Beret captain in Vietnam. In October 1969 Albracht took command of a remote hilltop outpost called Firebase Kate in the Quang Doc Province of South Vietnam, held by 27 American soldiers and 156 Montagnard militiamen. At dawn the next morning, three North Vietnamese Army regiments crossed the Cambodian border and attacked. Albracht's men held off repeated ground assaults by the Communist forces. After five days Kate's defenders were out of ammunition and water. Albracht led his troops off the hill and on a night march through enemy lines, a feat never duplicated during the Vietnam War. He saved 150 lives during the evacuation of the battle site Firebase Kate. Albracht was awarded three Silver Stars for his actions in the Vietnam War. He has also received three Purple Hearts and five Bronze Stars. =After the war= For 25 years, Albracht served as a United States Secret Service agent. During his time with the Secret Service, he guarded five American presidents and numerous foreign officials. After his retirement, he managed executive security operations for the Ford Motor Company. In 2005, Captain Albracht returned to his hometown. He served on the board of the Quad Cities chapter of Vietnam Veterans of America for five years, and was its president for two terms. In the 2012 election for the Illinois State Senate in the 36th district, Albracht made an unsuccessful bid for political office as a Republican against Senator Mike Jacobs. Writings Along with Captain Marvin J. Wolf, Albracht wrote the book Abandoned in Hell: The Fight for Vietnam's Firebase Kate. It recounts Albracht's leadership in Vietnam, specifically his heroic actions on a remote hilltop outpost called Firebase Kate. The reception for Abandoned In Hell: The Fight For Firebase Kate has generally been positive. The Washington Independent Review of Books wrote, \\"With a foreword by Joseph L. Galloway (co-author of We Were Soldiers Once) and excellent illustrations and photos, Abandoned in Hell: The Fight for Vietnam's Firebase Kate is a story that deserved to be well told.\\" Major General Paul Vallely, two-tour Vietnam veteran, Fox News senior military analyst, and author of Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror, wrote, \\"This gripping, gritty and cinematic blow-by-blow account of outnumbered Americans locked in a desperate battle with the North Vietnamese Army is destined to become a classic of its genre.

This serial has also been dubbed in Assamese language as Soti Beula and aired on Focus Hifi.It is again re-airing on star jalsha during this lockdown period.  Plot  The show was adapted from the Hindu mythological story of Manasamangal KƒÅvya and Behula. The story of Manasamangal begins with the conflict of the merchant Chandradhar or Chand Sadagar with Manasa and ends with Chandradhar becoming an ardent devotee of Manasa. Chandradhar is a worshipper of Shiva, but Manasa hopes that she can win over Chand to her worship. But, far from worshipping her, Chand refuses to even recognize her as a deity. Manasa takes revenge upon Chand by destroying seven of his ships at sea and killing his seven sons. Finally, Behula, the newly-wed wife of Chand's youngest son Lakhindar, makes the goddess bow to her love for her husband through her strength of character, limitless courage and deep devotion. Behula succeeds in bringing Chand's seven sons back to life and rescuing their ships. Then only does Behula return home. Manasamangal is the tale of oppressed humanity. Chandradhar and Behula have been portrayed as two strong and determined characters at a time when ordinary human beings were subjugated and humiliated. The epic brings out the caste divisions and the conflicts between Aryans and non-Aryans. The conflict between human beings and the goddess brings out the social discriminations of society, as well as the conflict between Aryans and non-Aryans. Shiva, whom Chand worshipped, was originally not an Aryan god, but over time was elevated to that position. Manasa's victory over Chand suggests the victory of the indigenous or non-Aryan deity over the Aryan god. However, even Manasa is defeated by Behula. The poem thus suggests not only the victory of the non-Aryan deity over the Aryan god, but also the victory of the human spirit over the powerful goddess. Manasamangal is also remarkable for its portrayal of Behula who epitomises the best in Indian womanhood, especially the Bengali woman's devotion to her husband.

It is approximately long and flows through Newport Township. The creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Nanticoke. Most of the land in its vicinity is forested land, but there are also some patches of developed land, agricultural land, and \\"disturbed\\" land. The main rock formations in the watershed are the Llwellyn Formation, the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Pocono Formation. The main soils are the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series and the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. The creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired. Course Reservoir Creek begins in a valley on Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain in Newport Township. It flows east for several tenths of a mile before entering a pond and turning north. After several tenths of a mile, the creek leaves Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain and turns north-northwest, flowing along the border of Wanamie. After a short distance, it turns north and reaches its confluence with South Branch Newport Creek. Hydrology The entire length of Reservoir Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by abandoned mine drainage due to pH and siltation. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Reservoir Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The lower reaches of Reservoir Creek are on rock of the Llwellyn Formation. Further upstream, there is a thin band of Pottsville Formation. The creek's upper reaches are on rock of the Mauch Chunk Formation. Just south of its upper reaches is an area of rock of the Pocono Formation. The lower reaches of Reservoir Creek are on soil of the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. However, the creek's upper reaches are on soil of the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series. At some point in the past, the course of Reservoir Creek was altered from its original course. A portion of Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain is in the watershed of Reservoir Creek. Watershed Reservoir Creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Nanticoke. Most of the land in the vicinity of Reservoir Creek is forested land. However, there are some small patches of agricultural land and \\"disturbed\\" land. Some developed land is present in the village of Wanamie, not far from the creek's mouth. A portion of Reservoir Creek is within a 300-acre tract of land protected by the North Branch Land Trust. It mainly contains a forest of hardwood trees and softwood conifers. A reservoir known as the Wanamie Reservoir was located on Reservoir Creek. Historically, it was dammed by the Wanamie Dam and had an area of 15 to 20 acres. However, the dam was removed in 2007 for safety reasons and the reservoir was drained in the same year. The remains of the dam can still be found in the area. History Reservoir Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 1, 1989. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1212408. Coal mining has been done in the vicinity of Reservoir Creek in the past. In 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection requested $114 million from the Abandoned Mine Land Program for a series of abandoned mine-related projects. One such project involved rerouting a section of Reservoir Creek away from areas at risk of flooding and closing several mine openings in the area. This project takes place on a 42-acre tract of land and is estimated to cost less than $1,000,000. A 1320-foot stretch of the creek is to be relocated to a more stable channel and the old unstable channel is to be filled in.

This number is :\\\\frac {n(n+3)} 2, where n is the degree of the curve. The theorem is due to Gabriel Cramer, who published it in 1750.* . Geneva: Fr√®res Cramer & Cl. Philibert, 1750. For example, a line (of degree 1) is determined by 2 distinct points on it: one and only one line goes through those two points. Likewise, a non- degenerate conic (polynomial equation in x and y with the sum of their powers in any term not exceeding 2, hence with degree 2) is uniquely determined by 5 points in general position (no three of which are on a straight line). The intuition of the conic case is this: Suppose the given points fall on, specifically, an ellipse. Then five pieces of information are necessary and sufficient to identify the ellipse--the horizontal location of the ellipse's center, the vertical location of the center, the major axis (the length of the longest chord), the minor axis (the length of the shortest chord through the center, perpendicular to the major axis), and the ellipse's rotational orientation (the extent to which the major axis departs from the horizontal). Five points in general position suffice to provide these five pieces of information, while four points do not. Derivation of the formula The number of distinct terms (including those with a zero coefficient) in an n-th degree equation in two variables is (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2\\\\. This is because the n-th degree terms are x^n, \\\\, x^{n-1}y^1, \\\\, \\\\dots , \\\\, y^n, numbering n + 1 in total; the (n ‚àí 1) degree terms are x^{n-1}, \\\\, x^{n-2}y^1, \\\\, \\\\dots , \\\\, y^{n-1}, numbering n in total; and so on through the first degree terms x and y, numbering 2 in total, and the single zero degree term (the constant). The sum of these is (n + 1) + n + (n ‚Äì 1) + ... + 2 + 1 = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2 terms, each with its own coefficient. However, one of these coefficients is redundant in determining the curve, because we can always divide through the polynomial equation by any one of the coefficients, giving an equivalent equation with one coefficient fixed at 1, and thus [(n + 1)(n + 2) / 2] ‚àí 1 = n(n + 3) / 2 remaining coefficients. For example, a fourth degree equation has the general form :x^4+c_1x^3y+c_2x^2y^2+ c_3xy^3+c_4y^4+c_5x^3+c_6x^2y+c_7xy^2+c_8y^3+c_9x^2+c_{10}xy+c_{11}y^2+c_{12}x+c_{13}y+c_{14}=0, with 4(4+3)/2 = 14 coefficients. Determining an algebraic curve through a set of points consists of determining values for these coefficients in the algebraic equation such that each of the points satisfies the equation. Given n(n + 3) / 2 points (xi, yi), each of these points can be used to create a separate equation by substituting it into the general polynomial equation of degree n, giving n(n + 3) / 2 equations linear in the n(n + 3) / 2 unknown coefficients. If this system is non-degenerate in the sense of having a non- zero determinant, the unknown coefficients are uniquely determined and hence the polynomial equation and its curve are uniquely determined. More than this number of points would be redundant, and fewer would be insufficient to solve the system of equations uniquely for the coefficients. Degenerate cases An example of a degenerate case, in which n(n + 3) / 2 points on the curve are not sufficient to determine the curve uniquely, was provided by Cramer as part of Cramer's paradox. Let the degree be n = 3, and let nine points be all combinations of x = ‚Äì1, 0, 1 and y = ‚Äì1, 0, 1. More than one cubic contains all of these points, namely all cubics of equation a(x^3-x) +b(y^3-y)=0. Thus these points do not determine a unique cubic, even though there are n(n + 3) / 2 = 9 of them. More generally, there are infinitely many cubics that pass through the nine intersection points of two cubics (B√©zout's theorem implies that two cubics have, in general, nine intersection points) Likewise, for the conic case of n = 2, if three of five given points all fall on the same straight line, they may not uniquely determine the curve. Restricted cases If the curve is required to be in a particular sub-category of n-th degree polynomial equations, then fewer than n(n + 3) / 2 points may be necessary and sufficient to determine a unique curve. For example, the generic circle is given by the equation (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2 where the center is located at (a, b) and the radius is r. Equivalently, by expanding the squared terms, the generic equation is x^2-2ax+y^2-2by=k, where k=r^2-a^2-b^2. Two restrictions have been imposed here compared to the general conic case of n = 2: the coefficient of the term in xy is restricted to equal 0, and the coefficient of y2 is restricted to equal the coefficient of x2. Thus instead of five points being needed, only 5 ‚Äì 2 = 3 are needed, coinciding with the 3 parameters a, b, k (equivalently a, b, r) that need to be identified.

Although initially promoted as a sequel by its publisher, it is now accepted as being a first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird with many passages being used again. The title comes from Isaiah 21:6: \\"For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.\\" It alludes to Jean Louise Finch's view of her father, Atticus Finch, as the moral compass (\\"watchman\\") of Maycomb, and has a theme of disillusionment, as she discovers the extent of the bigotry in her home community. Go Set a Watchman tackles the racial tensions brewing in the South in the 1950s and delves into the complex relationship between father and daughter. It includes treatments of many of the characters who appear in To Kill a Mockingbird. A significant controversy around the decision to publish Go Set a Watchman centered around the allegations that 89-years-old Lee was taken advantage of and was pressured into allowing publication against her previously stated intentions. Later, when it was realized that the book was an early draft as opposed to a distinct sequel, it was questioned why the novel had been published without any context. HarperCollins, United States, and William Heinemann, United Kingdom, published Go Set a Watchman on July 14, 2015. The book's unexpected discovery, decades after it was written, and the status of the author's only other book as an American classic, caused its publication to be highly anticipated. Amazon stated that it was their \\"most pre-ordered book\\" since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in 2007, and stores arranged all-night openings beginning at midnight to cope with expected demand. Plot Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, a single 26-year-old, returns from New York to her hometown, Maycomb, Alabama, for her annual fortnight-long visit to her father Atticus, a lawyer and former state legislator. Jack, her uncle and a retired doctor, is Scout's mentor. Alexandra, her aunt, moved in with her brother Atticus to help him around the house after Calpurnia, their housekeeper, retired. Jean Louise's brother, Jeremy \\"Jem\\" Finch, has died of the same heart condition which killed his mother. Upon her arrival in Maycomb, she is met by her childhood sweetheart Henry \\"Hank\\" Clinton, who works for Atticus. When returning from Finch's Landing, Jean Louise and Henry are passed by a car full of black men travelling dangerously at high speed; Henry mentions that the black people in the county have money for cars but are without licenses and insurance. The Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) are introduced as sources of controversy in the community. Jean Louise finds a pamphlet titled \\"The Black Plague\\" among her father's papers. She follows him to a Citizens' Council meeting where Atticus introduces a man who delivers a racist speech. Jean Louise watches in secret from the balcony and is horrified. She is unable to forgive him for his behaviour and flees from the hall. After dreaming about Calpurnia, her family's black maid whom she sees as a mother figure, Jean Louise has breakfast with her father. They soon learn that Calpurnia's grandson killed a drunk pedestrian the previous night while speeding in his car. Atticus agrees to take the case in order to stop the NAACP from getting involved. Jean Louise visits Calpurnia and is treated politely but coldly, causing her to leave, devastated. While at lunch, Jean Louise wants to know why Atticus was at the meeting. Uncle Jack tells her that Atticus has not suddenly become a racist but he is trying to slow down federal government intervention into state politics. Her uncle lectures her on the complexity of history, race, and politics in the South, in an attempt to get Jean Louise to come to a conclusion, which she struggles to grasp. She then has a flashback to when she was a teenager and recalls an incident where Atticus planted the seed for an idea in Henry's brain, then let him come to the right conclusion on his own. Jean Louise tells Henry that she does not love him and will never marry him. She expresses her disgust at seeing him with her father at the council meeting. Henry explains that sometimes people have to do things they don't want to do. Henry then defends his own case by saying that the reason that he is still part of the Citizens' Council is because he wants to use his intelligence to make an impact on his hometown of Maycomb and to make money to raise a family. She screams that she could never live with a hypocrite, only to notice that Atticus is standing behind them, smiling. During a discussion with his daughter, Atticus argues that the blacks of the South are not ready for full civil rights, and the Supreme Court's decision was unconstitutional and irresponsible. Although Jean Louise agrees that the South is not ready to be fully integrated, she says the court was pushed into a corner by the NAACP and had to act. She is confused and devastated by her father's positions as they are contrary to everything he has ever taught her. She returns to the family home furious and packs her things. As she is about to leave town, her uncle comes home. She angrily complains to him, and her uncle slaps her across the face. He tells her to think of all the things that have happened over the past two days and how she has processed them. When she says she can now stand them, he tells her it is bearable because she is her own person. He says that at one point she had fastened her conscience to her father's, assuming that her answers would always be his answers. Her uncle tells her that Atticus was letting her break her idols so that she could reduce him to the status of a human being. Jean Louise returns to the office and makes a date with Henry for the evening. She reflects that Maycomb has taught him things she had never known and rendered her useless to him except as his oldest friend. She goes to apologize to Atticus, but he tells her how proud of her he is. He hoped that she would stand for what she thinks is right. She reflects that she did not want her world disturbed but that she tried to crush the man who is trying to preserve it for her. Telling him that she loves him very much as she follows him to the car, she silently welcomes him to the human race. For the first time, she sees him as just a man. Development history Although promoted by its publisher and initially described in media reports as a sequel to Lee's best-selling novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which was published in 1960, Go Set a Watchman is actually that novel's first draft. The novel was finished in 1957 and purchased by the J.B. Lippincott Company. Lee's editor, Tay Hohoff, although impressed with elements of the story, saying that \\"the spark of the true writer flashed in every line\\", thought it was by no means ready for publication. It was, as she described it, \\"more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel\\". As Jonathan Mahler recounts in his Times article on Hohoff, she thought the strongest aspect of Lee's novel was the flashback sequences featuring a young Scout, and thus requested that Lee use those flashbacks as a basis for a new novel. Lee agreed, and \\"during the next couple of years, Hohoff led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" According to Mahler, \\"Ms. Hohoff also references a more detailed characterization of the development process, found in the Lippincott corporate history: 'After a couple of false starts, the story-line, interplay of characters, and fall of emphasis grew clearer, and with each revision‚Äîthere were many minor changes as the story grew in strength and in her own vision of it‚Äîthe true stature of the novel became evident.' (In 1978, Lippincott was acquired by Harper & Row, which became HarperCollins, publisher of Watchman.)\\" Mahler remarks that \\"there appeared to be a natural give and take between author and editor. 'When she disagreed with a suggestion, we talked it out, sometimes for hours,' Ms. Hohoff wrote. 'And sometimes she came around to my way of thinking, sometimes I to hers, sometimes the discussion would open up an entirely new line of controversy.'\\" In terms of the initial characterization of Atticus as a segregationist, an element to his character that was dropped in the later draft, there are various theories already offered. Mahler offers that it could have been Hohoff that inspired the change. Raised \\"in a multigenerational Quaker home near Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Hohoff attended a Quaker school, Brooklyn Friends. Such an upbringing suggests certain progressive values. But probably the clearest window into her state of mind when she was coaching Ms. Lee through the rewrite of Mockingbird is the book she was writing herself at the time: a biography of John Lovejoy Elliott, a social activist and humanist in early-20th-century New York who had committed his life to helping the city's underclass. The book, A Ministry to Man, was published in 1959, one year before Mockingbird.\\" Michiko Kakutani made note of the changes between the two versions: \\"Some plot points that have become touchstones in Mockingbird are evident in the earlier Watchman. Scout's older brother, Jem, vividly alive as a boy in Mockingbird, is dead in Watchman; the trial of a black man accused of raping a young white woman ... is only a passing aside in Watchman. (The trial results in a guilty verdict for the accused man, Tom Robinson, in Mockingbird, but leads to an acquittal in Watchman.)\\" She continues, \\"Students of writing will find Watchman fascinating for these reasons: How did a lumpy tale about a young woman's grief over her discovery of her father's bigoted views evolve into a classic coming-of-age story about two children and their devoted widower father? How did a distressing narrative filled with characters spouting hate speech (from the casually patronizing to the disgustingly grotesque‚Äîand presumably meant to capture the extreme prejudice that could exist in small towns in the Deep South in the 1950s) mutate into a redemptive novel associated with the civil rights movement, hailed, in the words of the former civil rights activist and congressman Andrew Young, for giving us \\"a sense of emerging humanism and decency\\"? Kakutani also goes on to describe that not only are characterizations and plot points different, the motivation behind the novel shifts as well, stating: \\"Somewhere along the way, the overarching impulse behind the writing also seems to have changed. Watchman reads as if it were fueled by the alienation of a native daughter‚Äîwho, like Lee, moved away from small-town Alabama to New York City‚Äîmight feel upon returning home. It seems to want to document the worst in Maycomb in terms of racial and class prejudice, the people's enmity and hypocrisy and small-mindedness. At times, it also alarmingly suggests that the civil rights movement roiled things up, making people who \\"used to trust each other\\" now \\"watch each other like hawks\\". According to Kakutani, \\"Mockingbird, in contrast, represents a determined effort to see both the bad and the good in small-town life, the hatred and the humanity; it presents an idealized father-daughter relationship (which a relative in Watchman suggests has kept Jean Louise from fully becoming her own person) and views the past not as something lost but as a treasured memory. In a 1963 interview, Lee, whose own hometown is Monroeville, Ala., said of Mockingbird: 'The book is not an indictment so much as a plea for something, a reminder to people at home.'\\" The papers of Harper Lee's literary agents in the 1950s, Annie Laurie Williams and Maurice Crain, are held by Columbia University's Rare Book & Manuscript Library. Their records show that Go Set a Watchman was an early draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, and underwent significant changes in story and characters during the revision process. Harper Lee was writing Go Set a Watchman in January 1957, and sold the manuscript to the publisher J. B. Lippincott in October 1957. She then continued to work on the manuscript for the next two years, submitting revised manuscripts to her literary agents. At some point in that two-year period, Lee renamed her book To Kill a Mockingbird. Some of these records have been copied and posted online. Discovery The manuscript for the novel was originally thought to be lost. According to The New York Times, the typed manuscript of Go Set a Watchman was first found during an appraisal of Lee's assets in 2011 in a safe deposit box in Lee's hometown of Monroeville. Lee's lawyer, Tonja Carter, later revealed that she had first assumed the manuscript to be an early draft of To Kill a Mockingbird. Later, upon learning in the middle of 2014 of the existence of a second novel at a family gathering, she then re-examined Lee's safe-deposit box and found the manuscript for Go Set a Watchman. After contacting Lee and reading the manuscript, she passed it on to Lee‚Äôs agent, Andrew Nurnberg. Lee released a statement through her attorney in regards to the discovery. \\"In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman. It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel from the point of view of the young Scout. I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. After much thought and hesitation I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.\\" Controversy Some publications have called the timing of the book \\"suspicious\\", citing Lee's declining health, statements she had made over several decades that she would not write or release another novel, and the recent death of her sister and caregivertwo months before the announcement. NPR reported on the news of her new book release, with circumstances \\"raising questions about whether she is being taken advantage of in her old age\\". Some publications have even called for fans to boycott the work. News sources, including NPR and BBC News, have reported that the conditions surrounding the release of the book are unclear and posit that Lee may not have had full control of the decision. Investigators for the state of Alabama interviewed Lee in response to a suspicion of elder abuse in relation to the publication of the book. However, by April 2015 the investigation had found that the claims were unfounded. Historian and Lee's longtime friend Wayne Flynt told the Associated Press that the \\"narrative of senility, exploitation of this helpless little old lady is just hogwash. It's just complete bunk.\\" Flynt said he found Lee capable of giving consent and believes no one will ever know for certain the terms of said consent. Marja Mills, author of The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee, a friend and former neighbor of Lee and her sister Alice, had a contrasting perception. In her piece for The Washington Post \\"The Harper Lee I knew\\", she quotes Lee's sister Alice, whom she describes as \\"gatekeeper, advisor, protector\\" for most of Lee's adult life, as saying \\"Poor Nelle Harper can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence.\\" She makes note that Watchman was announced just two and a half months after Alice's death and that all correspondence to and from Lee goes through her new attorney. She describes Lee as \\"in a wheelchair in an assisted living center, nearly deaf and blind, with a uniformed guard posted at the door\\" and her visitors \\"restricted to those on an approved list\\". New York Times columnist Joe Nocera continues this argument. He also takes issue with how the book has been promoted by the 'Murdoch Empire' as a \\"Newly discovered\\" novel, attesting that the other people in the Sotheby's meeting insist that Lee's attorney was present in 2011, when Lee's former agent (whom she subsequently fired) and the Sotheby's specialist found the manuscript. They say she knew full well that it was the same one submitted to Lippencott in the '50s that was reworked into Mockingbird, and that Carter had been sitting on the discovery, waiting for the moment when she, and not Alice, would be in charge of Harper Lee's affairs. He questions how commentators are treating the character of Atticus as though he were a real person and are deliberately trying to argue that the character evolved with age as opposed to evolved during development of the novel. He quotes Lee herself from one of her last interviews in 1964 where she said \\"I think the thing that I most deplore about American writing‚Äîis a lack of craftsmanship. It comes right down to this‚Äîthe lack of absolute love for language, the lack of sitting down and working a good idea into a gem of an idea.\\" He states that, \\"a publisher that cared about Harper Lee's legacy would have taken those words to heart, and declined to publish Go Set a Watchmanthe good idea that Lee eventually transformed into a gem. That HarperCollins decided instead to manufacture a phony literary event isn't surprising. It's just sad.\\" Others have questioned the context of the book's release, not in matters of consent, but that it has been publicized as a sequel as opposed to an unedited first draft. There is no foreword to the book, and the dust jacket, although noting that the book was written in the mid-1950s, gives the impression that the book was written as a sequel or companion to Mockingbird, which was never Lee's intention. Edward Burlingame, who was an executive editor at Lippincott when Mockingbird was released, has stated that there was never any intention, then or after, on the part of Lee or Hohoff, to publish Watchman. It was simply regarded as a first draft. \\"Lippincott‚Äôs sales department would have published Harper Lee‚Äôs laundry list\\", Burlingame said. \\"But Tay really guarded Nelle like a junkyard dog. She was not going to allow any commercial pressures or anything else to put stress on her to publish anything that wouldn‚Äôt make Nelle proud or do justice to her. Anxious as we all were to get another book from Harper Lee, it was a decision we all supported.\\" He said that in all his years at Lippincott, \\"there was never any discussion of publishing Go Set a Watchman\\". Brilliant Books, an independent bookstore in Michigan, made headlines by offering full refunds to customers who felt duped by the marketing of the book, calling it \\"shameful\\" and \\"exploitative\\". They released a statement shortly after Go Set a Watchman was released, comparing the book to James Joyce's Stephen Hero and condemning its publication. Reception Go Set a Watchman received mixed reviews. Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times described Atticus' characterization as \\"shocking\\", as he \\"has been affiliating with raving anti-integration, anti- black crazies, and the reader shares [Scout's] horror and confusion\\". Aside from this reveal, Kakutani does make note that Watchman is the first draft of Mockingbird and discusses how students of writing will find Watchman fascinating for those reasons. A reviewer for The Wall Street Journal described the key theme of the book as disillusionment. Despite Atticus' bigotry in the novel, he wins a case similar to the one he loses in To Kill a Mockingbird. Michelle Dean of The Guardian wrote that many reviewers, such as Michiko Kakutani, allowed their personal convictions and takes of the controversy that erupted before the publication to leak into the reviews. She defends the novel as a \\"pretty honest confession of what it was to grow up a whip-smart, outspoken, thinking white woman in the south...[-] unpleasant\\", and stated that the book's bad reception is due to the \\"[shattering of] everyone's illusions...that Harper Lee was living in satisfied seclusion\\".https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/go-set-a-watchman- harper-lee-legacy-to-kill-a-mockingbird Entertainment Weekly panned the book as \\"a first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and said, \\"Though Watchman has a few stunning passages, it reads, for the most part, like a sluggishly-paced first draft, replete with incongruities, bad dialogue, and underdeveloped characters\\". \\"Ponderous and lurching\\", wrote William Giraldi in The New Republic, \\"haltingly confected, the novel plods along in search of a plot, tranquilizes you with vast fallow patches, with deadening dead zones, with onslaughts of clich√© and dialogue made of pamphleteering monologue or else eye-rolling chitchat\\". On the other hand, Dara Lind of Vox states that \\"it's ironic that the reception of Go Set a Watchman has been dominated by shock and dismay over the discovery that Atticus Finch is a racist, because the book is literally about Scout ‚Äî who now goes by her given name, Jean Louise ‚Äî ...[who] has been living in New York, and quietly assumed that her family back home is just as anti-segregationist as she is\\".https://www.vox.com/2015/7/16/8974447/harper-lee-go-set-a-watchman-racism- controversy In The New Yorker, Adam Gopnik commented that the novel could be seen as \\"a string of clich√©s\\", although he went on to remark that \\"some of them are clich√©s only because, in the half century since Lee's generation introduced them, they've become clich√©s; taken on their own terms, they remain quite touching and beautiful\\". Maureen Corrigan in NPR Books called the novel \\"kind of a mess\\". In The Spectator, Philip Hensher called Go Set a Watchman \\"an interesting document and a pretty bad novel\\", as well as a \\"piece of confused juvenilia\\". \\"Go Set A Watchman is not a horrible book, but it's not a very good one, either\\", judged the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, citing among other flaws its \\"overly simplistic\\" plot. Alexandra Petri wrote in The Washington Post, \\"It is an inchoate jumble ... Go Set a Watchman is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a good, or even a finished book. For the first 100 pages it lacks anything that could even charitably be described as a plot. ... [T]he writing is laughably bad. ... I flung the book down and groaned audibly and I almost did not pick it back up even though I knew I had fewer than 100 pages to go. ... This should not have been published. It‚Äôs 280 pages in desperate need of an editor. ... If you were anywhere in the vicinity of me when I was reading the thing, you heard a horrible bellowing noise, followed by the sound of a book being angrily tossed down. ...\\" Contrastingly, Sam Sacks of The Wall Street Journal praised the book for containing \\"the familiar pleasures of Ms. Lee‚Äôs writing‚Äîthe easy, drawling rhythms, the flashes of insouciant humor [and] the love of anecdote\\".https://www.wsj.com/articles/dark-days-in-maycombto-killa- mockingbird-1436564966 Author Ursula K. Le Guin wrote that \\"Harper Lee was a good writer. She wrote a lovable, greatly beloved book. But this earlier one, for all its faults and omissions, asks some of the hard questions To Kill a Mockingbird evades.\\" Go Set a Watchman set a record for the highest adult novel one-day sales at Barnes & Noble, which included digital sales and pre- orders made before July 14. Barnes & Noble declined to release the exact number. Some translations of the novel have appeared. In the Finnish translation of the novel by Kristiina Drews, \\"nigger\\" is translated as if \\"negro\\" or \\"black\\" had been used. Drews stated that she interpreted what was meant each time, and used vocabulary not offensive to black people. In 2015, the book won the primary Goodreads Choice Award.

He uses cold glass (fabricated glass) sculpting process to create his works. His glass Spectrum Cube and Tear Drop sculptures were used in the Marvel film Guardians of the Galaxy. Career Born in Exeter, New Hampshire, Storms attended Plymouth State College where he earned a degree in art, studio emphasis, with a minor in art history. During his junior year, Storms was introduced to glass while working for a local glass sculptor. Storms started his own studio in 2002 in Carmel Valley, California. In 2004, he opened StormsWorks Studio. He created a cold glass lathe, where he was able to turn glass like one would turn wood enabling him to make shapes like eggs, wine bottles and baseball bats using the cold glass process, which otherwise would be impossible. The glass artist moved his studio to Valencia, California in 2013, where he expanded his operation and opened Storms Publishing. Storms specializes in both geometric and representational glass sculptures. Some of his work can be figurative as well as abstract. Storms works with three different types of glass: optical crystal, lead crystal, and dichroic glass. He cuts and stacks slivers of dichroic glass and glues them with a two part epoxy to achieve a \\"floating core look,\\" he then layers optic or crystal glass around the first structure, then hand sculpts it into a specific shape. It can take more than ten weeks to produce one piece. He uses the Fibonacci theory at the core of every one of his designs. In 2011, the Harrington Art Partnership commissioned Storms to create a large glass bell for public display at the Firehouse Arts Center in Pleasanton, California. The five hundred pound, two-foot tall Firehouse Crystal Bell is an allusion to the art gallery's history as the city's first fire station and it was created in part to honor past firefighters. The bell is composed of over eight thousand pieces of glass and features the use of Starphire glass in addition to the other three glasses that Storms works with. Storms spent approximately two years on the optic bell. In 2012, Douglas Biro commissioned Storms to create a work of art that commemorates Derek Jeter's 3000th hit. The Optic Crystal Baseball Bat was designed from three thousand pieces of glass. The Carmel Valley Rotary Club commissioned Storms to create a sculpture as a gift to President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo to mark the opening of the first blood bank in Africa.

As a young man he was a close friend of the poet Gaston Cout√©. Early years Fernand D√©sir√© Alfred Despr√©s was born in Ouzouer-le-March√©, Loir-et-Cher on 13 April 1879. He was born in the hamlet of Mauvelles. While young he spent holidays with a friend of the father of the future poet Gaston Cout√©. He and Gaston Cout√© formed a friendship that would last after they had moved to Paris. Despr√©s went with Cout√© and his parents to Mauves, and Cout√© went with Despr√©s to Beauce. Despr√©s found work as a shoemaker with Constant Marie, known as P√®re La Purge, an anarchist theoretician. He met the young anarchist Miguel Almereyda (Eug√®ne Bonaventure Vigo) around 1896 and would be godfather to his son, the future filmmaker Jean Vigo. Journalist In 1899 Despr√©s began to contribute to the Journal du Peuple, edited by S√©bastien Faure. In 1901 he and Almereyda were charged in a case involving manufacture of explosives, but his charge was dismissed. In 1901 he became a full-time journalist. He contributed to the journal L‚ÄôHomme that year, then to Libertaire, La Guerre sociale and La Bataille syndicaliste. He occasionally wrote violent articles for L'Humanit√©. He also wrote for the Les Cahiers de l‚ÄôUniversit√© Populaire, an anarchist journal, in 1906 and 1907. He was charged with forgery in 1909, but the charge was dismissed. In 1911 Despr√©s was on vacation in Chandry, Ouzouer-le-March√© when he heard of the death of Gaston Cout√©. Without access to notes, he wrote a leading article on Cout√© for a special edition of La Guerre Sociale entirely from memory. He later wrote other articles on Cout√© in the Vie Ouvri√®re (1911), the Journal du Peuple, the Bataille Syndicaliste and in Humanit√© (1924). From 1912 Despr√©s devoted himself to the trade union struggle. He became one of the leading writers using the pseudonym \\"A. Desbois\\". He was registered in Carnet B before World War I (1914‚Äì18). He was a militant pacifist in 1915 with Romain Rolland, Marcelle Capy, Pierre Monatte and others. In August 1915 he and his partner Marcelle Capy resigned from the La Bataille syndicaliste because the paper had adopted the union sacr√©e position and would not let him write in defense of his friend Romain Rolland. Despr√©s contributed to the anarchist journal L‚Äô√âcole de la F√©d√©ration between 1915 and 1919. In 1918‚Äì19 Despr√©s was charged with aiding the enemy after staying with Romain Rolland in Geneva, but the charge was dismissed. In 1918 Despr√©s, Marcel Martinet and Jean de Saint-Prix published La Pl√®be, a magazine that was harassed by the censors and then banned. Despr√©s contributed to the L‚ÄôAvenir international between 1918 and 1920, a review that was very favorable to the Russian Revolution. He stayed in Aisne after the war, then in 1920 moved to Anzin, Nord, where he worked as a boilermaker. There he established the revolutionary syndicalist committee of Valenciennes, and in 1921 became its secretary. Communist activist Despr√©s joined the French Communist Party when it was founded in December 1920. He left the Nord department at the end of 1921. He contributed to the Communist journal L'Humanit√©. His salary at L'Humanit√© was that of a skilled workman, enough to cover expenses but not much more. Although Despr√©s remained a member of the party for the rest of his life, he also remained a convinced revolutionary syndicalist, a position that began to seem old fashioned. He was not always willing to follow the party line, which caused some difficulties when he was working for party's official organ, although he was highly respected and his position was reasonably secure. Despr√©s was a delegate to the 11th Congress of the Communist Party in October 1922. In 1926 he was a member of the party's Colonial Commission. Despr√©s ran unsuccessfully as Communist candidate for election to the legislature in 1932 for Fontenay-le- Comte, Vend√©e He later worked as a proofreader while continuing to contribute to l‚ÄôHumanit√©. Despr√©s left Paris for Nice at the start of World War II (1939‚Äì45). In June 1940 he took refuge in North Africa, where he lived alone in a hotel room. The Germans destroyed all his books and papers. After the war, he was not allowed to travel. He wrote for the press in Oran and Algiers, and worked for the radio service in Algiers until the end. Fernand Despr√®s died in Algiers on 14 February 1949, aged 69. He had suffered a paralyzing stroke a few days earlier, and died in hospital.

It is endemic to Sri Lanka and only known from its type locality, Gilimale forest near Ratnapura, the Sabaragamuwa Province. Etymology The specific name ranwellai honours Sanjeewa Ranwella for his contributions towards conserving the Gilimale forest reserve. Description Adult males measure and females, based on one measured specimen, in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is elongated and the head long. The snout is truncate in dorsal aspect and rounded in lateral and ventral aspects. There are four dorsal spines. The canthus rostralis is rounded. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers are basally webbed while the toes are half-webbed. The body colour is variable, from white to green, with yellow more frequent. There are very small, scattered black spots on the body. The throat, vocal sacs, chest and belly are all white. They can also change their colour to brown, providing them camouflage on the forest floor. Reproduction After heavy rains, males congregate in areas with small, temporary water holes. Males have three types of advertisement calls: a long, pulsated, duck-like \\"qua\\", a short pulsed note, and a short \\"tok\\" note; the latter two are emitted when other calling males are present. A pair in axillary amplexus has been recorded on a branch 1.5 m above the ground. The pair moved down to the ground and after a still period, the female started burrow into the leaf litter. However, at this point the pair was disturbed by a shrew, and could not be relocated. It remains unknown whether the species is a foam nester or a direct developer. Habitat and conservation The type locality is a lowland rainforest at above sea level. Polypedates ranwellai were typically found near forest edges with open canopy, and were more seldom, in closed-canopy forest. Some frogs were observed on the forest floor but most were perched on branches of trees and shrubs 1‚Äì10 m above the ground. They are only active during the periods of heavy rain. The type locality is a forest reserve. Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats in the area, and also occur in the reserve. Paving the road entering the reserve has led to increased visitations and associated problems. The planned damming of the Kalu river would completely wipe out the known population.

He was an Officer-in-Charge of the Demonstration Team of the Civil Aid Service and received British Empire Medal for his civil service in 1956. Rafeek was first elected to the Urban Council in a by-election on 25 June 1964 when Chan Shu-woon, a former Reform Club councillor was sued by the Club chairman Brook Bernacchi for alleged corruption during the election campaign. Rafeek won a seat by defeating Napoleon Ng who represented the Civic‚ÄìReform coalition, the alliance between the Civic Association and Reform Club, the two political groups in the Urban Council to demand for democratic reform from the government. The Reform Club accused some members of the Civic Association had used their influential to back up Rafeek who was already a member of the Association. The Club found this unacceptable within the terms of the Coalition, and became one of the reasons for the coalition being dissolved. Rafeek formally joined the Civic Association in April 1965.

The Martyrology of Oengus the Culdee (c. 1150) calls it Huib Dr√≥na in Middle Irish. The ruling family claimed descent from Drona, fourth son of Cathair M√≥r, a legendary 2nd century AD king. Location Idrone West is found in the western part of County Carlow, west of the River Barrow. Idrone West barony is bordered to the southeast by Idrone East; to the northeast by Carlow; (both the preceding baronies are also in County Carlow); to the west by Gowran and Fassadinin, County Kilkenny; and to the northwest by Slievemargy, County Laois. History The U√≠ Bairrche and Ui Drona are cited early here. The O'Riain (Ryan) sept was Lords of Idrone. The √ì Dubhghaill (O'Doyle) clan of Viking origin was said to originate from a 9th-century King of Idrone.

It connects the Mountain Home Air Force Base to SH-51 in the city of Mountain Home. Route description SH-67 begins at the main entrance of the Mountain Home Air Force Base, located in southwestern Elmore County. The five-lane highway, named Airbase Road, travels due north from the base entrance to a junction with Grand View Road (signed as SH-167). From the junction, SH-67 turns northeast and travels through a section of the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in the barren outskirts of Mountain Home as a four-lane, undivided highway. The highway then enters the city of Mountain Home and turns east before passing a municipal airport. SH-67 terminates at an intersection with SH-51 near the east end of the airport, located approximately west of an interchange with Interstate 84. Except for a brief divided section at the intersection with SH-167, the entire highway is four-lane non-divided, with center lane-left turn only areas where needed. History The history of SH-67 goes back to at least the 1930s, when the first all-weather gravel road connecting Grand View and Mountain Home was built (represented by today's SH-167, SH-67 and SH-51), and can be seen on a 1937 map of the area.Rand McNally and Company, Road map: Idaho, Mont., Wyo., published by Texaco, 1937 A road from this road to the site of the base has existed since at least November 1942, when base construction began. The route received its current number designation in the late 1960s in honor of the base's then-host unit, the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (1965-1971). The original SH-67 also included the entirety of SH-167 from Grand View to where it currently intersects with SH-67 approximately from the base's main gate. In order to improve the base's prospects to remain open during a round of base closures in the 1970s, Idaho's legislature voted to expand the highway to the base to four lanes, although it was an area noted for gusty winds and tumbling tumbleweeds and little else. The expansion project also realigned the highway to go directly to the base's main gate. The unexpanded two-lane section of SH-67 that passed to the west of the base was delisted and unsigned (even though it was still officially maintained by ITD for the Simplot feed lot and the base's recreation area at C. J. Strike Dam just north of the Snake River) prior to its redesignation as SH-167.

A portion of the album hearkens back to Jerry Lee's musical roots, with two Hank Williams covers and a moving rendition of the traditional \\"Old Country Church,\\" but it mostly features ballads couched in the smooth production provided by long-time producer Jerry Kennedy. An often overlooked track is Jerry Lee's reading of Bob McDill's \\"Closest Thing To You,\\" which only made it to number 27 but features a hauntingly restrained vocal from \\"the Killer.\\" The LP rose to number 16. Graceland arrest Country Class was released the same year that Lewis was arrested outside Elvis Presley's Graceland home for allegedly planning to shoot him. Lewis had already nearly killed his bass player Butch Owens on September 29 (his forty-first birthday) when a .357 accidentally went off in his hand. In Rick Bragg's 2014 authorized biography Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, Lewis explains that the reclusive Presley had been trying to reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring that he \\"come out to the house.\\" Lewis replied that he would if he had time but that he was busy trying to get his father Elmo out of jail in Tunica for a DUI. Later that night, Lewis was at a Memphis nightclub called Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. \\"Charles Feron, he owned Vapors, he give it to me,\\" Lewis clarifies to Bragg. \\"A .38 derringer. Me, pretty well drunk, with that derringer - it ain't somethin' strange.\\" Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new Lincoln Continental with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates because the \\"nose of that Lincoln was a mile long.\\" Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle through the car window, not realizing it was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but \\"Elvis, watching on the closed-circuit television, told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Jerry Lee, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs.\\" Lewis: \\"The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do?

Members are primarily neurologists and physiatrists‚Äîas well as allied health professionals and PhD researchers. History In 1951, a small group of physicians who practiced clinical electromyography and electrodiagnosis began working to organize a professional society dedicated to the growing medical specialty of electrodiagnostic medicine. Their goal was to create a professional network; to build a platform for discussion of research; and to establish standards and measure quality. On August 29, 1953, another gathering took place at the Palmer House in Chicago, IL, to formally organize the American Association of Electromyography and Electrodiagnosis (AAEE). Membership AANEM has several membership categories depending upon an individual‚Äôs credentials. Physicians who are board certified in Electrodiagnostic Medicine (as determined by the American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine) are ‚ÄúFellow‚Äù members. There are also categories for physicians-in-training, international physicians, and academic researchers, nerve conduction study technologists, and collaborators. AANEM Technologist members assist with studies such as nerve conduction studies (NCSs), electroencephalograms (EEGs), intraoperative monitoring (IOM), evoked potentials, polysomnography, and ultrasound. AANEM collaborator members are nonphysician providers who work in collaboration with a neurologist or PMR physician to treat patients with neuromuscular diseases. Collaborators do not perform or interpret needle electromyography (EMG) studies or interpret NCSs but are active in the field of neuromuscular medicine. AANEM research members are currently active in neuromuscular or electrodiagnostic research and are a PhD investigator, engineer, holder of a master's degree, or graduate student enrolled in a PhD degree program. Affiliations AANEM participates in the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN). The IFCN consists of national member societies. Education Since 1954, the AANEM has held an annual meeting. The meeting offers educational sessions updating physicians, technologists, and researchers working in the area of neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, and electrodiagnostic medicine. Attendees earn continuing medical education (CME) through hands-on workshops and educational sessions. In addition to the annual meeting, the association holds small-group workshops around the country covering ultrasound and nerve conduction studies. To help members obtain continuing medical education (CME), AANEM is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide CME credit as Accreditation with Commendation.) The AANEM offers many CME products including: course books, interactive cases, case studies, journal articles, and self-study materials. AANEM offers podcasts by a diverse group of practicing physicians who describe their research and practical insights. Advocacy AANEM tracks and responds to federal and state legislative and regulatory health policies related to neuromuscular and electrodiagnostic medicine. Activities include creating guidelines and position statements to educate lawmakers and insurance companies, partnering with governmental agencies and private insurers to fight fraud and abuse and advocating for quality patient care. AANEM's guidelines are published through the US Department of Health & Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality National Guidelines Clearinghouse. AANEM also participated in the Choosing Wisely campaign established by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Foundation by creating a list of five situations in which electrodiagnostic and other imaging studies are inappropriate in an effort to educate patients and spur conversation between the provider and the patient. AANEM monitors private sector market trends and critical practice issues and provides members with updates, practice management resources, and tools to respond to the constantly evolving healthcare environment. The association also works closely with several other medical societies and patient advocacy groups to ensure that neuromuscular patients have adequate access to necessary, quality treatment. AANEM has a seat in of the AMA House of Delegates and participates in both the Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) processes. These groups give physicians a voice in establishing new and revised electrodiagnostic and neuromuscular codes as well as being a part of the process used to assign relative value units to new and established CPT codes. American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine In 1963, the AANEM began discussion of an examination as an educational experience for membership candidates. The first examination was given in 1967 and successful candidates were transferred to the association active membership category. In 1987 the AANEM approved to separate its membership and examination functions. The American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine (ABEM) was created as an autonomous examining body that offered formal certification of competency in electrodiagnostic medicine. The ABEM examination is the only United States exam certifying physicians in EDX medicine, with more than 3,500 physicians currently certified. The ABEM certification process requires physicians to obtain specific academic training and clinical experience, then demonstrate competency in the EDX evaluation of neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems by passing an examination. Diplomates of the ABEM are required to document their continuing education in electrodiagnostic medicine over the course of the ABEM Maintenance of Certification Program (MOCP) and take a maintenance examination. The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology provides certification examination in the related field of clinical neurophysiology. The American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology certifies in electroencephalography (EEG), Evoked Potentials (EP), Polysomnography (PSG), Epilepsy Monitoring, and Neurologic Intraoperative Monitoring (NIOM). In the US physicians typically specialize in EEG or EDX medicine but not both. Laboratory Accreditation The AANEM developed the Electrodiagnostic Laboratory Accreditation Program in 2010 as a voluntary, peer-review process that identifies and acknowledges electrodiagnostic laboratories that achieve and maintain the highest level of quality, performance, and integrity based on professional standards. AANEM Foundation In 1995 the AANEM established the AANEM Foundation for Research & Education, as a charitable, 501(c)3 nonprofit organization to advance research and science related to muscle and nerve disorders. The AANEM Foundation helps fund numerous studies and research awards related to neuromuscular and electrodiagnostic medicine. Publications In 1982, Muscle & Nerve, a monthly, peer-reviewed, scientific journal, became the AANEM's official journal. Published by Wiley, the journal publishes research and education directly related to neuromuscular and electrodiagnostic topics. The AANEM News is the official publication of AANEM. The print newsletter is distributed to all members biannually and includes updates on legislation, education, and products or programs related to neuromuscular and electrodiagnostic medicine and the association. The AANEM e-newsletter was launched in 2008. It provides information to AANEM members about coding and advocacy issues, new products, and other relevant information.

Eights monks were killed by the Pakistan Army in the massacre.  Background  Sree Angan is a Hindu ashram of the Mahanam Sampradaya order of Vaishnavism, in the Goalchamat locality of Faridpur town.  Killings  On 21 April, the Pakistan army landed in Faridpur. From Dhaka they crossed the Padma at Goalundo Ghat and proceeded towards Faridpur. Around evening as they were entering Faridpur they were passing through Goalchamat. At this point, their Bihari collaborator stopped them by the Sree Angan ashram. The Pakistan Army surrounded the ashram and with the help of Bihari collaborators entered the compound. At the news of their arrival, some of the resident monks fled the monastery. But nine monks refused to leave the ashram. At that time the monks were singing kirtan at the prayer hall of the temple. The kirtan had chants of \\"Jaya Jagatabandhu Hari! Jaya Jaya Jagatabandhu Har!!\\". It is said that the Pakistani soldiers mistook the chants as \\"Jai Bangabandhu\\" and the Bihari collaborators too convinced them that the monks were chanting for victory to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The Pakistani soldiers entered the prayer hall and dragged the monks to the open space in front of the temple, beneath the elephant apple tree adjacent to the temple. One monk, Nabakumar Brahmachari escaped and locked himself up in the room beneath the staircase. The remaining eight were made to stand in a line in front the Pakistani soldiers who had already taken position. According to eye witness accounts, twelve shots were fired one by one. The monks chanted \\"Jaya Jagatabandhu Hari\\" as they fell down. The soldiers and the Bihari collaborators looted valuables and cash from the ashram. On the next morning, the corpses were taken away by a Faridpur Municipality truck. On 26 April, the Pakistan army destroyed the shikhara of the temple using dynamite.  Aftermath  The brutal killings on the very first day of Pakistani occupation created panic among the Hindu citizens. Many of them left the town for countryside. Two surviving monks Amar Bandhu and Haripriya Brahmachari recovered the holy relic of Lord Jagatbandhu and carried them in a casket to India. According to Rabindranath Trivedi, Captain Jamshed who had commanded the massacre and the subsequent desecration and destruction of the temple, committed suicide in front of the altar of Lord Jagatbandhu Sundar a few days before the surrender of Pakistan Armed Forces on 16 December 1971. He was reportedly buried within the Sree Angan compound, near the pond of the Shiva temple by the collaborators. According to the testimony of freedom fighter Prabodh Kumar Sarkar, Captain Jamshed had become a lunatic before his death. The monks returned after the liberation of Bangladesh. They restored the holy relic and rebuilt the damaged temple. News monks were gradually initiated in the order.  Memorial  In 1996, a memorial was erected in the compound of Sree Angan by the ashram authority. Eight black plaques were raised for the eight deceased monks. The plaques have the shape of truncated pyramid with a square base measuring 40 square centimeters and 95 centimeters in height. A memorial has also been erected in Sree Sree Mahanam Angan , Kolkata , India .Here we can see the names of 8 monks written in 8 pieces of engraved marbles.[central big engraved marble piece is to describe the monument]  See also  * Ishangopalpur massacre * Char Bhadrasan massacre * Hasamdia massacre * Prabhu Jagadbandu  References  Category:1971 Bangladesh genocide Category:Massacres of Bengali Hindus Category:1971 in Bangladesh Category:1971 in Pakistan Category:Mass murder in 1971 Category:Massacres committed by Pakistan in East Pakistan Category:April 1971 events in Asia ","title":"Sree Angan massacre"},{"id":"45293897","text":"Lechazo asado (roast lamb), shown above, is a typical dish from the province of Valladolid and others castilian provinces.

Above all, he is remembered for his fierce use of satire in criticizing and resisting the German occupation of Denmark during World War II. > Biography Little has been published about Engman's life. It is known that he traveled as a working seaman and spent some time living in New York City's Chinatown around 1920. He began to show paintings in Copenhagen in the mid 1920s. He became part of a group of self-styled \\"Underground Painters\\". His shows always inspired controversy as he utilized caricature and satire to mercilessly criticize social ills and those in power especially the growing power of the Nazi Party in Germany. These shows culminated in 1940 with the \\"Black Banners\\" show in Copenhagen aimed directly at the Nazi leadership. Refusing to remain silent about Hitler, Engman \\"depicted Der Fuhrer, not as a genius of satanic majesty, as many Danish Anti-Nazis saw him, but as a psychopathic misfit, a frightened and conceited fool, sort of a ludicrous master clown of the world's arena.\\" Following this show Engman was forced into exile in the North Zealand and eventually fled occupied Denmark for Sweden where he remained through the war. From Sweden he continued to fight the Nazis with his art painting and contributing drawings to the journal \\"The Dane\\" as well as some Swedish publications. Artistic style and works Engman's artistic style was fiercely independent and self-taught. He did not move in the modern directions of surreal or abstract art, nor was he following the traditional Danish folk painters. His style combines a keen sense of caricature occasionally verging on the comic with a real mastery of the use of light and color to evoke emotion.

The innovation At the time of her win, Judge was a second-year student at Kinsale Community School in Kinsale. Their project involved a statistical investigation of the effects of Diazotroph bacteria on plant germination. They investigated how the bacteria could be used to fight world hunger. Their project aims to provide a solution to low crop yields by pairing a nitrogen- fixing bacteria in the soil with cereal crops. They found their test crops germinated in half the time and had a drymass yield up to 7 percent greater than usual. Activities Ciara is a former member of the Irish Digital Youth Council.

Originally kept in the Feoli Collection, it now belongs to the antiquity collection of the Martin von Wagner Museum in W√ºrzburg, where it is on display with a lid which probably does not belong to it.Inventary number HA 117 (= L 504); Beazley Archive Database Number 205438. Description Both the execution of the potter's work and the imagery are typical for vases of this period. There are hundreds of slight variations of the theme of the arming scene depicted on the amphora. However the painting on this amphora, which was attributed to Hermonax by John Beazley, is of a higher quality than most depictions of this theme. On the front there is a young woman, who helps a young man to arm himself. Both wear only a chiton, normally the young man would also have a two-part shirt and skirt. While the young man stoops slightly to put on his sword (though it was normal to put the greaves on first), the woman passes him his helmet, which has moveable cheek-plates and face plate. She also hold his round shield, which has the emblem of a snake on it as an emblem. Body armour, greaves, and spear are absent. Since the Persian Wars, the items were common for Athenian hoplites. Although at the time when the vase was created, the Athenian fleet was acquiring an ever more significant part in Athenian warfare, the hoplite remained the ideal citizen in arms and was depicted in an idealised form for a long time. Also long hair was no longer in fashion at the time of the creation of the vase and referred back to the Late Archaic, heroic period of the Persian Wars. Interpretation There are two theories about who is depicted here. On the one hand it has been suggested that the young man is Achilles receiving from his mother Thetis the weapons made by Hephaistos during the Trojan War and that the image derives from a scene in book 19 of Homer's Iliad.Homer, Iliad 19.10 A detail of this vase supports this theory: under the shield there are several lines from the vase painter's preliminary sketches. These sketches were engraved in the half dried clay before the firing in the slip with which it was covered before being fired. In these it can be seen that the female figure was originally intended to be naked. Generally the only women who were depicted naked in Greek art were goddesses, mythological figures like Maenads or Nymphs, and prostitutes. A second theory sees the young man, in Athenian custom at this age probably not yet married, simply as a Greek warrior, preparing for a campaign. Such a scene could only be set in a domestic environment. The woman depicted in the scene is too young to be his mother, so she must therefore be the young man's sister. Possibly a distinction has been consciously created by Hermonax between the divine and human spheres. Another factor in favour of the second theory is the fact that the people and the weapons look very dainty and hardly divine. The reverse of the vase shows a man with a spear in the process of leaving, receiving a patera from a woman who fills it from a jug. This might signify the religious aspect of the departure to war, the departure offering.  Bibliography * John Beazley.

When Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Sir Peter Brian Medawar were awarded their 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of acquired immunological tolerance, Owen was not mentioned in the prize. However, in a letter to Owen, Medawar stated that he believed Owen should have also been included in the prize.Crow, James F., November 1996, \\"A Golden Anniversary: Cattle Twins and Immune Tolerance, Genetics, 144: 855-859 Owen also led the successful effort to admit women as California Institute of Technology (or Caltech) undergraduates.  Early life and education  Owen was born and raised on a dairy farm in Genesee, Wisconsin, on October 30, 1915. He attended school at the two-room Genesee State Graded School for eight years.Owen, Ray David, Interview by Rachel Prud‚Äôhomme, Pasadena, California, October‚ÄìNovember 1983, Oral History Project, California Institute of Technology Archives, Retrieved 1/7/2014 He continued his education at a high school in Waukesha, commuting the eight miles to and from school every day from his family's farm. In 1937 Owen received a BS in biology from Carroll University (then Carroll College). In 1941 Owen received a PhD in genetics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he continued to work as a postdoctoral researcher and assistant professor for several years. It was during this time that Owen conducted his seminal work in twin calves. In 1946 Owen moved to Pasadena, California, to join the biology department at Caltech as a Gosney Fellow.  Research  As a PhD student Owen studied mainly birds; his thesis was on the sterility of species hybrids. As a postdoctoral fellow in the Immunogenetics Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, Owen's research interests moved from fowl to cattle. The lab studied blood samples from cattle all over the world, investigating genetic markers and the inheritance of red blood cell antigens. This research led Owen to investigate a genetic situation involving twin calves fathered by different sires. Each calf expressed both sets of paternal blood group antigens. Owen's ‚Äúanalyses revealed that the twins were chimeric, each containing their own blood cells as well as those derived from their twin sibling.‚Äù These twins were immunologically compatible. Owen's findings were published with little attention until Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Frank Fenner published their monograph ‚ÄúThe Production of Antibodies‚Äù in 1949. It was through Burnet and Fenner's work that Peter Medawar learned of Owen's findings and used it to help explain his findings that dizygotic twin calves accept each other's skin grafts after birth. This eventually led to Burnet and Medawar's 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of acquired immunological tolerance. Owen's research continued in the field of immunology and genetics, especially tolerance and stem cells. He co-authored papers that described ‚Äúthe use of radiation as a means of blocking or resetting the immune system before transplantation of bone marrow or other tissues.‚Äù  Career at Caltech  Owen in 1986 Caltech offered Owen an assistant professorship in biology in 1947. He earned full professorship in 1953 and was named professor emeritus in 1983. From 1961 to 1968, Owen served as chairman of the Caltech Division of Biology. While Owen maintained an active research program, his teaching, mentoring and administrative undertakings became an important part of his academic career. Owen co-authored (with Adrian Srb) \\"General Genetics\\", published in 1952. It was the most widely read genetics textbook of its time. In the early 1960s Owen chaired Caltech's ad hoc ‚ÄúCommittee on the Freshman Year.‚Äù The committee's recommendations were adopted in 1964, including a pass/fail grading system for freshmen and the introduction of electives into the freshman curriculum. This committee also worked to allow women admission at Caltech; the university's first female undergraduate students enrolled in 1970. Owen also served as vice president for student affairs and dean of students from 1975 to 1980. He was a supportive mentor and teacher to all learners.Owen, David, December 2014, \\"In Memoriam: Ray D. Owen, PhD, AAI ‚Äò66\\", The American Association of Immunologists Newsletter, Pages 22-23 In an interview with the University of Wisconsin, Owen's son David opined that his father's rural upbringing influenced his career in many ways ‚Äì- his work ethic, his skill at working with animals, and his support for women, minorities and other who faced undue obstacles on the path to careers in science. ‚ÄúHe knew that talented people come from all backgrounds,‚Äù David Owen stated.  Personal life  Owen met June Weissenberg‚Äîhis wife of 74 years‚Äîat Carroll University. June died in August 2013. The couple had two sons, David and Griffin; Griffin died in a car accident in 1970.

He served as a member of the Assembly of the Republic representing the Lefko≈üa District between 1998 and 2018. During this time, he was a member of the National Unity Party (UBP) between 1998 and 2010, serving as the leader of the party between 2006 and 2008. He returned to the UBP in 2012 and remained its representative until the end of his tenure as an MP. He served in different ministerial positions, including a five-year tenure as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense between 1998 and 2004. Early life and education He was born in 1953 in Nicosia and studied political science in the University of Arizona, graduating in 1981. In 1983, he started working in the Northern Cyprus Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defense. Political career Between 1986 and 1991, he worked in the TRNC Representation in London, after which he was appointed as the undersecretary of the Prime Ministry, where he worked until 1994. He was re-appointed to the same post in 1996, afterwards, he also occupied the post of presidency in BRT. In the 1998 parliamentary election, he was elected as a member of the parliament from Lefko≈üa District in the National Unity Party (UBP). From 31 December 1998 to 16 January 2004, he served as the Turkish Cypriot Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense. He was reelected in 2003, 2005, 2009 and 2013. Between 16 December 2006 and 29 November 2008, he was the president of the UBP. On 15 March 2010, he was expelled from the UBP due to his candidacy in the presidential election against the party's leader, Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu. He received 3.81% of the popular vote in the election. Afterwards, a court ruling deemed his expulsion unlawful. On 15 July 2011, he established his own party, the Democracy and Trust Party, which he abolished in 2012 to rejoin the UBP. In 2014, he created controversy by calling √ñzdil Nami, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, \\"a child\\". In July 2015, he became the Minister of Transport, in the cabinet under √ñmer Kalyoncu. He served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the √ñzg√ºrg√ºn cabinet formed on 16 April 2016. His tenure as an MP ended in 2018 after he failed to get re-elected in the 2018 election. Ertuƒüruloƒülu defines himself as a Turkish nationalist, seeing himself as a Turk living in Cyprus and defining Cypriotness as a \\"geographical identity\\" secondary to Turkishness. He advocates a two-state solution to the Cyprus dispute, with the aim of the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Controversies In a controversial decision, Ertuƒüruloƒülu on 20 May 2016 restricted Greek Orthodox communities to only hold a single religious service per year, with the exceptions of the Apostolos Andreas Monastery in Rizokarpaso, the Monastery of St. Barnabas in Famagusta and St. Mamas' Church in Morphou. The decision was criticised by the Turkish Cypriot group Famagusta Initiative as well as Burak Mavi≈ü of the Turkish Cypriot Teachers‚Äô Trade Union (KT√ñS) but was defended by the Association of the Ex-Servicemen of the Turkish Resistance Organisation leader Yƒ±lmaz Bora. During the buildup to the Annan Plan for Cyprus referendum in 2004, Ertuƒüruloƒülu was criticised as a \\"radical nationalist\\". This was due to his reportedly saying \\"if need be, I will fight in the mountains and continue my struggle\\". Ertuƒüruloƒülu has said that his words have been misinterpreted and he never made such a statement, but, being not bothered by people's perception that he made such a statement, he \\"wished that he said that\\" and that he had said \\"we need to resist the Annan plan, even risking death if there is the need\\". Personal life He is married with two children.

B. Morison in contemporary sources, was a New Zealand barrister. He stood in two elections around the turn of the century in the Otaki electorate and was later active with the Reform Party. Early life and political ambitions Morison was born in 1861 in Elgin, Scotland. His family emigrated to New Zealand when he was a boy. He received his education at Nelson College. Morison twice contested the electorate for conservative interests. In the 6 December , he was defeated by the incumbent, Henry Augustus Field. Upon Field's death within days of the election, he contested the resulting by-election on 6 January and was beaten by Field's brother William. In later years, Morison was one of the principal organisers of the Reform Party in Wellington. Legal career Morison received his legal apprenticeship with Arthur Rigby Bunny, the second son of Henry Bunny. After his admission to the bar, he practised at Woodville for a short time from 1885, before moving to Wellington. Arthur Richmond Atkinson joined him as a partner in 1892. When that partnership dissolved, he partnered with C. A. Loughnan, a brother of Robert Loughnan. In 1896, they took over the practice of Worley Edwards upon his appointment to the Supreme Court. Loughnan left the firm to become the city solicitor for Palmerston North and was replaced by his brother F. O. B. Loughnan. That partnership lasted until 1904, and for the following two years, Morison practised on his own. In 1906, he took G. McLean as a partner, and upon his partner's death in 1908, W. S. Smith joined him. From 1912, David Smith worked for him as an assistant; Smith would later become a judge. Morison was appointed a King's Counsel in November 1912. He specialised in company law and MƒÅori land issues. He wrote several books on legal matters, of which The Law of Limited Liability Companies in New Zealand (1904) and Rescission of Contracts (1916) are regarded as standard works.

The district has 7,402 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2014). Since 2007, the Korso major region has included the following nine districts: Matari, Korso, Mikkola, Metsola, Lepp√§korpi, Jokivarsi, Nikinm√§ki, Vierum√§ki and Vallinoja. The Korso major region has a total 29,765 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2014). Geography Korso is located to the west of the main north-south track line of the Finnish railways. The nearest city is Kerava, six kilometres to the north. =Neighbouring areas= According to the Vantaa neighbourhood division, Korso is bordered by the railway tracks to the east, by Vallinoja to the north and by Vierum√§ki to the northwest. History and future The name Korso was born when the crossing point of the borders of three villages - Ali- Kerava and Hyryl√§ in Tuusula as well as Hanab√∂le in the old parish of Helsinki - was marked by a cross on the highest cliff of Korso (the word \\"cross\\" is kors in Swedish and the word \\"border\\" is r√•; thus the name originally meant \\"cross border\\"). There is a memorial plaque about the history of Korso near the Ruusuvuori school. =19th century= At the end of the 19th century, an overtake point was needed on the main railway track line halfway between Tikkurila and Kerava. The Korso stop was built in 1889 in nearly uninhabited wilderness at the border of Tuusula and the Helsinki parish - Korso. The train started to stop at Korso twice a day, which provided a starting point for the development of the area. The current disused station building was built in 1938 according to Thure Hellstr√∂m's class V station plans for the Sein√§joki- Kristinestad-Kaskinen railway track line. =20th century= When Kerava was separated from Tuusula as a market town in 1924, the area of the old Ali- Kerava village was included wholly in it. It also included the Korso railway station, whose neighbourhood formed a clearly separate residential point from the centre of the market town. The area grew quickly especially after the wars, and in the 1950s, Korso was the largest connected separate-home-based residential area in Finland. Factories, such as Sokeva owned by the Central Organisation for the Hard of Sight, were also founded in Korso. The Korso railway station was located very near to the point, called the old Korsr√• boundary point, where the boundaries of Helsingin maalaiskunta, Tuusula and Kerava met each other. As this residential area grew, it flowed into both neighbouring municipalities. This caused administrative problems, and because of them Korso was wholly incorporated in Helsingin maalaiskunta in the beginning of the year 1954.Korson kunta , Socialist democratic workers' association of Korso. Accessed on 6 August 2011. At the same time, there was an option to make Korso into a separate municipality. Tuusula and Kerava supported this idea, but Helsingin maalaiskunta opposed it, because the new Korso would also have included Rekola, located in Helsingin maalaiskunta.Vantaan Laurin arkisto Since the 1970s, some apartment buildings have also been built in the Korso district in Kulom√§ki, Mikkola and Vallinoja and around the Korso railway station. Still, Korso remains mainly a separate- home-based area. =21st century= In the current millennium, a multi-use house Lumo has been built in the district. The railway station and the parish centre have also been renewed. The student housing buildings built in the area serve as homes to many students in the Helsinki capital area. The building of the Maarukanmets√§ residential area started in the early 2000s in the southeastern part of Mikkola and continues to be built to this day. =Future plans= * A Korso-Koivukyl√§ sports park Elmo to be built between Kulom√§ki and Rekolanm√§ki. * More apartments, services and jobs are planned in the centre of Korso.Korson ytimeen tulee lis√§√§ asuntoja ‚Äì t√§lt√§ uusi keskusta voisi n√§ytt√§√§ Construction of new apartment buildings in underway in the center, including an 18 story apartment building. * Keh√§ IV, plans to widen the Kulom√§entie road (regional road 152) to have 2+2 lanes. Services There is a post office near the Korso railway station to the east of the railway tracks, as well as Korso's social and health centre, which has a KELA service point. Also to the east of the railway tracks are a child care station and the Korso-Rekola psychiatric policlinic and a Christian parish of Korso. To the west of the railway tracks is the multi-use house Lumo, which has a common service point, a library, a sports hall as well the Lumon lukio school and the Lumo hall. Korso's dental care station and the Korson koulu school are also located to the west of the railway tracks. Traffic connections The Finnish national road 45, also known as the Tuusula highway, runs roughly five kilometres to the west of Korso, and the national road 4 (E75), also known as the Lahti highway, runs to the east of Korso. Both have a connection to the regional road 152, also known as Kulom√§entie, which runs very close to the south of the centre of Korso. As well as them, there are connections along the railway tracks to Tikkurila (to the south) and Kerava (to the north). The Helsinki Airport is located roughly 9 kilometres to the southwest. Public transport Korso belongs to the Helsingin Seudun Liikenne (HSL) regional ticket zone, served by regional buses, communal trains and the Helsinki Metro. A regional ticket allows journeys in Helsinki, Espoo, Kauniainen and Vantaa. A passenger travelling with a single ticket has the right to transfer inside the regional ticket zone for 80 minutes. =Communal trains= A platform at the Korso railway station in November 2009. The K and N trains run from Korso railway station to Helsinki central railway station and to Kerava railway station. During nighttime hours, the station is served by T trains to Helsinki and Riihim√§ki. =Buses= There are several bus lines from Korso to Helsinki. It also has bus connections via the Peijas hospital to Mellunm√§ki, Tikkurila, Kerava, southern P√§iv√§kumpu, Hyryl√§, Myyrm√§ki and the Helsinki Airport. The Korso express bus stop serves bus connections between Lahti and the Helsinki Airport, as well as long-distance express connections between Rovaniemi and Helsinki. =Connecting parking= The Korso railway station parking hall and its environment have 390 parking spaces for cars. There are also roughly 155 parking spaces for bicycles.

Viento Sur, n√∫m. 115. pp. 64-71. The LCR had a trotskyist ideology, adopting more heterodox political positions in the 1980s. History =Foundation and clandestinity= The LCR was founded in 1971 by members of the Catalan group Communisme, a split of the Popular Liberation Front (PLF or Felipe). It was the Spanish section of the Fourth International (post-reunification), one of the fractions of the Trotskyist Fourth International. The LCR had the purpose of being a revolutionary party that rejected class collaboration and advocated a model of territorial organization based in a confederation of republics, recognizing of the right of self-determination for all the peoples of Spain. In 1972 the LCR suffered a split called Communist League (LC), which joined the LCR again in 1978. In 1973 it merged with a split of ETA after VI Assembly called for that very ETA-VI: the majority of the members of that organization, revolutionary communists, decided to abandon armed struggle as a way of fighting against the Francoist State and decided to seek unity with similar groups in the rest of Spain. With this union the LCR gained presence in the Basque Country, which until then the LCR had not just presence, using the name of LCR-ETA (VI). =Transition= The death of caudillo Francisco Franco, and partly because of the difficulty of explaining outside the Basque Country that reference to ETA, LCR-ETA (VI) changed again its name to LCR. A new independent, but fraternal, organization was founded in the Basque Country with the name of Liga Komunista Iraultzailea (LKI). The first meeting of LKI, held in Arantzazu, in 1977 and still in clandestinity, ended with the arrest of all the assembly (150 people), although shortly after the arrest they were released and the party began to be tolerated. After the first democratic elections, legalized. In that elections the LCR supported the Front for Workers' Unity (FUT), that gained 41,208 votes (0.22%).

Thus, in 1978 in Valencia, the LCR supported the United Left of the Valencian Country (EUPV) along with the Communist Movement of the Valencian Country, and nationalist groups, such as Valencian People's Union. In 1980 the LCR supported Unity for Socialism for the autonomic elections in Catalonia, and in 1982 again in Catalonia, supported the Communist Front of Catalonia to the Spanish general elections. =Unity with the Communist Movement and ideological changes= In the Basque Country, Liga Komunista Iraultzailea, Langile Abertzale Iraultzaileen Alderdia and Nueva Izquierda formed the coalition Auzolan, which also received support from the EMK. The LCR-MC unit had great importance in the Spanish politics of the 1980s, as they were some of the main promoters of the mobilizations against the NATO (through the Anti-NATO Commission and the Civic Platform) and later against the US bases in Spain, in the trial of the GAL, in the insubordinate movement against the compulsory military service, in the development of the feminist movement or even the first manifestations of the gay pride day. Both groups campaigned for Herri Batasuna (HB) outside of the Basque Country in the elections to the European Parliament of 1987. Collaboration with HB was not without tensions, as both organizations were very critical of the methods of ETA. HB finally gained a seat in Brussels. =Dissolution= In 1991 MC merged with LCR and formed Alternative Left (Izquierda Alternativa), which had a brief existence.

Early life and family  Bruce Mazlish was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1923. His father, Louis Mazlish, had immigrated as a teenager from what was then Russia. A largely self-taught engineer and entrepreneur, Louis Mazlish started a laundry service for which he developed much of the equipment. He married Lee Reuben in 1919, and had three children, of whom Bruce was the middle, with an older brother Robert and a younger sister, Elaine. Bruce Mazlish attended local public primary schools in Brooklyn, and then elected to go to Boys High School, which drew its students on a city-wide basis. Upon graduation he entered Columbia University in 1940. Having enlisted in the Officer's Reserve Corps, Mazlish was called up in 1943, and underwent basic training in the US infantry. Subsequently he served in the Office of Strategic Services, assigned to the Far East arena, in Morale Operations. When the war ended, Columbia granted him a catch-up BA dated 1944. Mazlish worked as a journalist at The Washington Daily News (now defunct) for half of a year, spent a year with his wife in Mexico working on a novel, and then worked at a third-rate prep school, teaching English (for which he was qualified) and History (which he learned by reading one chapter ahead of his students). Teaching the latter gave him an original view of the discipline, and the G.I. Bill drove educational expansion and demand for teachers in the post-WWII years. In this way, Mazlish stumbled onto the path of the academic world, teaching history for two years at the University of Maine, Brunswick campus, and then completing advanced degrees at Columbia University in literature (MA thesis: ‚ÄúDefoe: Criminologist,‚Äù 1947) and then a Ph.D in Modern European History, where he worked mainly under Professors Shepherd Clough and Jacques Barzun (thesis on ‚ÄúBurke, Bonald and De Maistre: A Study in Conservative Thought‚Äù, 1955).\\" Mazlish was married to Neva Goodwin, daughter of David Rockefeller, an economist and co-director of the Global Development And Environment Institute at Tufts University, with whom he published and edited several works. Previously, he was married to Constance Shaw (fellow OSS officer in WWII), and to Anne Austin. He had two children from his first marriage, Cordelia and Peter Shaw, two from his second, Anthony and Jared Mazlish, and two stepchildren, David and Miranda Kaiser. He passed on November 27, 2016 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was eulogized in The New York Times, by several at the Toynbee Prize Foundation, by MIT News, and at an MIT Memorial service.

Background By 1977, Lewis's long relationship with Mercury Records and producer Jerry Kennedy was coming to an end. He had signed with Smash, a division of Mercury, in 1963 and in 1968 began an incredible run on the country charts with 17 Top 10 hits, including four chart toppers, but by the mid-seventies his albums were beginning to sound overproduced and stale as the hits dried up. Years of constant touring, boozing, and pill popping had also caught up to Lewis, who would begin to have ongoing health problems (such as bleeding ulcers and stomach tears) for the first time in 1977. His voice had also grown noticeably hoarse. He was still very much in-demand as a performer, making guest appearances on the late-night TV show The Midnight Special and selling out shows, but he would only record one more album for Mercury, 1978's Jerry Lee Keeps Rockin'. Recording Lewis's last big hit on Mercury was \\"Middle Age Crazy\\", a song written by Sonny Throckmorton about a man who wants to stay young forever, a poignant theme for Lewis. In the liner notes to the 2006 retrospective A Half Century of Hits, Kennedy remembers the session coincided with one of Lewis's first hospitalizations, and that \\"the Killer\\" \\"was as white as a sheet. I was surprised we got anything from him.\\" The track - which features legendary blind session man Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins on piano, not Lewis - had been pre- recorded by Kennedy in advance, leaving Jerry Lee to overdub his vocal. \\"That was our last big hit,\\" Lewis recalled to biographer Rick Bragg in 2014. \\"That's something Jerry Kennedy wanted to prove he could do. The voices and everything, except mine. And I brought it home and played it, and I played it, and I learned it...And I went up there to Nashville, and he set it up and everything, and I walked up to the microphone, took one take on it, and that was it.\\" The single went to number 4 on the Billboard country chart. A second single, the Bobby Braddock ballad \\"Come On In\\", also hit the top 10.

There is evidence of a church from Saxon times, but the present building was built sometime between 1200 and 1250, with various additions and alterations in the 14th, 15th, 19th and 20th century. The church is one of the most recognisable sights of Aylesbury; its ornate clock tower dominates the skyline. The church is currently a Grade I listed building as it is a building of exceptional interest. History =Saxon period= Aylesbury possessed a church in Saxon times; 19th-century renovations to the chapel revealed the remains of an ancient crypt, with stone steps leading from the church in the west end of the crypt, and were uncovered as fully as possible without encroaching on the south transept. There is one prominent arch in it, which those competent to decide have unhesitatingly pronounced to be Saxon. The crypt was probably the remains of an old Saxon church, possibly dating from circa 571 when Aylesbury was a Saxon settlement known as Aeglesburge. Probably in troublous times this subterraneous chamber was used for worship but later it appears to have been used as a charnel house: piles of human bones were found within. These were removed and re-interred in the churchyard. It is not impossible that this may have been the very site of the Saxon building where St. Osyth is said to have been buried in the 9th century. St. Osyth's burial site in Aylesbury became a site of great, though unauthorized pilgrimage; following a papal decree in 1500, the bones were removed from the church and buried in secret. However much, if any, of this has a historical basis; it is even uncertain whether there were two Osyths or one, since both Aylesbury and Chich claim her relics. However what appears to be known is that following her death in 700AD her father, King Redwald (in some accounts Penda), and mother, Wilburga, took her to Aylesbury to be interred. =12th century= The Norman font which gives its name to a type called the 'Aylesbury fonts'The existence of an earlier building to the one now standing may be inferred from the beautiful Norman font found within the church and the existence of other artifacts of the same age. These were found buried in debris beneath the church in the 19th Century. The font in particular was found in three fragments and work was done to repair it. This font can be found at the West End of the Church today and has given its name to a particular style of font known as the \\"Aylesbury Fonts\\". These fonts are normally dated late in the 12th Century around the years 1170 to 1190. The early ecclesiastical history of Aylesbury is confusing and difficult to unravel. The Church was a Prebend in Lincoln Cathedral. It will be seen that the Prebendary of Aylesbury was attached to the See of Lincoln as early as 1092. An early account states \\"It is said that a Bishop of Lincoln, desired by the Pope, give the Personage of Aylesbury to a stranger, a kinsman of his, found means to make it a Prebend, and to incorporate it to Lincoln Church.\\" So in the reign of Edward III Aylesbury Church was part of the Deanery of Lincoln, and a separate stall in that Cathedral was set aside for the Dean. During excavation work in recent years a 12th-century cloister and a conduit pipe were identified. =13th century= The church as it stands today is supposed to have been erected at some date between 1200 and 1250 with various additions and alterations during the reign of either King John or Henry III of England. Originally the Church was a strictly cruciform design which is to say with a; chancel, nave, transepts and tower. It still retains substantially that form, though altered and modified at various periods. During the 11th through 14th centuries, a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches occurred across Western Europe. Aylesbury seems to have been part of this. In addition to being a place of worship, the church at this time would have been used by the community in other ways. It could have served as a meeting place for guilds or a hall for banquets. Mystery plays were sometimes performed, and they might also be used for fairs. The church could have also been used as a place to thresh and store grain. =14th century= St Mary the Virgin, Aylesbury (Pointed arch and doorway of the 14th Century)One of the most interesting portions of church is that of the Lady Chapel which is a beautiful erection of the 14th century. In this chapel an old sedilia (stone seats, found on the liturgical south side of an altar) was found in the wall in their proper position. It is supposed that the old fabric of the church extended no farther than the nave, having a high pitched roof springing from the walls. The light thus obtained being insufficient, it is thought that the clerestory, and the flat roof, were added in the 15th century. The east ends of the north and south chapels were probably extended about the same time, so as to form two larger chapels known today as the Chapel of St George and the Chapter House. =15th century= In 1450, a religious institution called the Guild of St Mary was founded in Aylesbury by John Kemp, Archbishop of York. Known popularly as the Guild of Our Lady it became a meeting place for local dignitaries and a hotbed of political intrigue. The Guild was influential in the final outcome of the Wars of the Roses. Its premises at the Chantry in Church Street, Aylesbury, are still there, though today the site is occupied mainly by almshouses. It is likely the incumbent at St Mary's would have been paid to perform a stipulated number of masses during a stipulated period of time for the guild in the Chapel. According to a tablet formerly in the church and dated as far back as 1494 John Stone of Aylesbury gave by will two tenements to the parish. The rents of which were to be applied to maintain a clock and chimes in the tower of Aylesbury Church for ever. The tower piers began to fail at an early period, and from time to time various expedients were resorted to, to strengthen them. An arch between the south-east pier and the transept must evidently have been frightfully crushed as early at least as the 15th century when it was blocked up and the pier buttresses both towards the transept and the lady chapel. At the same time the southern and eastern arches of the tower itself appear to have been much injured and to have lost their true curves. It might possibly have been about the same time that the arch on the west side of the transept was walled up and the south-west pier of the tower buttressed on its south side. During this period it is thought the Lady Chapel and Sacristy (now called the Vestry) was constructed on the East side of the North and South Transept respectively. The Sacristy is to appearances the oldest part of the building today. An oaken wardrobe in which is an ingeniously incorporated a swinging horse on which the priest's vestments were hung is still found in the church to this day and dates from the 15th Century. There is also a strong locker in which it is supposed the sacred vessels were deposited. Above the Sacristy is a room called the priest's chamber or priest's hole. The walls of this corner of the building are of immense strength, and the door is a very massive and remarkable one of the 15th century. =16th century= At a much later period (as is shown by the date 1596 upon the stonework) the remaining sides of the south-west pier were encased in stonework. A little later still in 1599 the same operation was performed on the north-west pier, and probably at the same time the arch abutting against it was walled up. King Henry VIII had himself declared Supreme Head of the Church in England in February 1531. The following acts which led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries impinged relatively little on English parish church activity. Parishes that had formerly paid their tithes to support a religious house, now paid them to a lay impropriator, but rectors, vicars and other incumbents remained in place, their incomes unaffected and their duties unchanged. In 1534 the church] became part of the newly formed Church of England forever separated from the Roman Catholic Church In 1536 almost a third of the county of Buckinghamshire became the personal property of King Henry VIII. Henry VIII was also responsible for making Aylesbury the official county town over Buckingham, which he is alleged to have been done in order to curry favour with Thomas Boleyn so that he could marry his daughter Anne Boleyn. This set the church on a path of expansion to the church it is today. Under his son, King Edward VI, more Protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted. Under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, a more radical reformation proceeded. A new pattern of worship was set out in the Book of Common Prayer (1549 and 1552). Henry VIII and his son Edward VI dismissed Catholicism and its trimmings. Then pro-Catholic Mary Tudor became queen. She attempted to re- establish the Catholic faith, including efforts to replace damaged, defaced and destroyed church artefacts. Mary was too late to prevent the whitewashing of church interiors and many irreplaceable wall paintings were lost. In the north transept is an alabaster monument to Lady Lee wife of Sir Henry Lee of Quarrendon, personal Champion to Queen Elizabeth I. It was formerly profusely ornamented with gold and colouring and is of the time of Queen Elizabeth I as Lady Lee died in 1584. Aylesbury Grammar School was founded in 1598 following a bequest from Sir Henry Lee and its first home was inside the Church. The Grammar School ran from 9am and 2pm. One of the trustees of the school was the Vicar of Aylesbury =17th century= Restoration-period spire, reaching In 1611 the Aylesbury Grammar School moved to what was then church buildings. These buildings now house the County Museum. The school remained here until 1907. In 1622 the south-east pier underwent a second buttressing, and at perhaps some other period the casing was built round that to the north-east, and its arches walled up. This is proof that in one instance at least (that of the south-west pier) the second casing failed at an early date, as is shown by the large clamps which have been added to it. There have subsequently there been continued failures in casing of both of the western piers. On Aylesbury Church there are no monuments from the 17th century or before and it did not at the time of its restoration in the 18th Century contain a single particle of ancient coloured glass. Therefore, the Church during this period is said to have undergone some exceedingly rough usage. During restoration work in the 19th Century they opened some of the closed archways prior to beginning work. Injuries to the building were to be observed inflicted on the ornamental stone work, which could not have been the result of accident. This damage was ascribed to the period of the English Civil War during the reign of King Charles I. Exposed as the Aylesbury district was to the full force of the mischievous effects of the civil commotions of that period, it would indeed have been extraordinary if this Church above all others had escaped the ravages and excesses of those unfortunate times, when the noblest ecclesiastical structures of our country were plundered, defamed, and defaced. Let us not forget the so-called Battle of Aylesbury on 1 November 1642. Indeed, in August, 1642, Nehemiah Wharton, a Parliamentarian soldier, writes from Aylesbury, telling his friends how they attacked a man called Penruddock, whom he called a Papist. He said the attack was because he had been \\"basely affronted by Penruddock and his dog\\". Finally he adds that he and his men \\"showed their zeal\\" and \\"got into the church, defaced the ancient and sacred glazed pictures, and burned the holy rails\\". A description of the church says how there was an old gallery in the church with its bird-cage pew. This pew was completely enclosed with lattice work and its front was ornamented with filigree work, presenting the appearance of a box at the opera, and thus named the bird-cage. This was the old manor pew, and was occupied by the judges and High Sheriff at the Assize sermon, and used upon other state occasions. The church also had a pulpit at the front which was nicknamed by the congregation a 'three-decker'. Some of the pews in the body of the church were fitted with brass rails and hangings to make them more private. In the north chapel were the high pews which were raised some feet above the floor and reached by three or four steps. The whole of the nave was filled with paneled pews over which the occupiers claimed exclusive and permanent right; it was thought something grand to be known as the owner of a 'faculty pew'. The divisions which were exceedingly high, were adorned according to the various owners; some were lined with blue cloth and bedizened with an abundance of large brass-headed nails; others would be scarlet; green baize was the prevailing 'comfort', whilst some of less pretensions were satisfied with paint. These pews were of all shapes and sizes, without the least pretense to uniformity. There was a jealous feeling respecting possession of pews; and it was a common practice for many of the owners to keep the doors carefully locked. When the wicked man came into church, his arrival was announced by the clicking of the locks of pew doors. The Commissioners and Visitors appointed to purify the church in the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell listed the Rev John Barton of Aylesbury a 'scandalous minister' and it was voted that he would be expelled. On 8 July 1642 information in writing was given to the House of Commons that John Barton had spoken against the Parliament. As a result, he was sent for and delivered to Parliament in custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms. John Barton did not deny the words and was committed to the 'Gatehouse' on 18 July, but discharged on 26 July of the same month. Subsequently, he was driven from the Vicarage. In 1691 it was arranged at a parish vestry that John Aylward who was a clockmaker, of Aylesbury was to have the tenements left by John Stone in 1494 for a period of 31 years at a peppercorn rent providing he erected and maintained a substantial clock and chimes in the tower of the church. The estate was described commonly as the Clock and Chimes Estate. The tower of the church is crowned by a small spire which is believed to date from the reign of Charles II. =18th century= The pews mentioned were still present in the 18th century. The Prebendal House was at times unoccupied for considerable periods and during which no use was made of the family pew. In 1759 'Dear Dell' seems to have asked John Wilkes to allow him to use the unoccupied pew, but notwithstanding the cordiality subsisting between them, and the obligations John Wilkes was under to 'Dear Dell', he is refused. John Wilkes writes in reply, \\"I cannot lend you my pew tho' I wou'd willingly assist your piety. I will tell you the particular reason (which you cannot guess) when I see you.\\" In 1756 it was proposed that a gallery should be erected. It was also agreed that the 'middle aisle' of the church be 'cieled'. Also in 1756 a charge appears in the Aylesbury Churchwardens book 'for setting the yew tree in the Churchyard'. It is not very clearly shown why. Old writers have explained its cultivation as necessary for the purpose of keeping up a stock of bows for archers, and others that it was planted to screen the Church from the effects of storms and tempests. In the year 1765 the state of the fabric of the church excited the serious attention of the parishioners and a Mr. Keen, a surveyor, was called in to report on its condition. His report confirmed the opinion of those assembled in vestry which was that the building was in a very unsafe state and required re-erection. It was resolved that his report be printed and published and copies sent to all the owners of estates in the parish with a request that they would pay after the rate of sixpence in the pound on their rentals for the space of ten years. This proposition does not seem to have been very popular as no further efforts were then made to obtain the money from them. Before a general restoration of the church in the 19th Century a portion only of the building, partitioned off from the transepts, was used for public worship. At this time the south transept resembled a marine store; this considerable part of the building was then used as the receptacle of all the paraphernalia of the parish fire brigade. =19th century= St Mary's Church, Aylesbury (Pre 1869, exact date unknown) In the times of the Napoleonic Wars, the stock of gunpowder required for the local regiments was stored in the innermost parts of the church. In 1821 the churchwardens expended ¬£250 in erecting a stable, coach house, and washhouse; this outlay was not satisfactory to the Charity Commissioners. These properties were situated somewhere in the vicinity of Temple Square. St Mary's Church, Aylesbury (1869) Plan of St Mary's Church, Aylesbury (1800s) Extensive renovations works were carried out after a report from the 1830s. Prior to the restoration of the Church the mural tablets were distributed in all parts of the building, but were mostly erected in the chancel and north transept. The Church had been under the process of what is called 'churchwardening' for many years, and a considerable debt was incurred for worse than useless patching. The real work of restoration commenced as far back as the year 1842, during the church wardenship of Mr. Fowler and Mr. Field. They first tried their hands on the interior of the south transept. For their services they received the thanks of a vestry, accompanied by a request that they would continue their labours. It was, however, found that the expenses would be very great, and it was hopeless to expect to raise anything like the sum required, by church-rates or appeals to the parishioners only. A surveyor from London had been consulted upon the state of the Church many years before 1848, and his report was a very concise one. He gave it as his opinion that the Church might probably stand until he got to Watford, but that it would fall before he reached home. On 24 September 1848, during the Sunday morning service, the chimes being silenced as usual, the fastenings by which they were held gave way, and caused a great clatter in the tower. Many thought the prophecy made by the surveyor had come to pass and that the Church was actually falling. There was a panic, and a great rush made by many of the congregation to escape from the supposed falling ruins; some scrambled over the tops of the pews, some tumbled over each other in attempting to make their way out, and for a time there was utter confusion. When the more timid had reached the churchyard, and their fears had become somewhat allayed by finding that there was nothing whatever the matter, they returned to their seats, and the service was resumed and continued. An 1848 survey by Sir Gilbert Scott revealed considerable problems with the foundations, and thus the walls and the roof. At a vestry held in 1849, this report was taken into consideration. Mr. Tindal received a mandate from the Archdeacon to do the necessary repairs to the fabric of the building. The object of the vestry, therefore, was to sanction the borrowing of ¬£3,000 for the purposes of repairs. This vestry was an exceedingly stormy one, the borrowing of the money being vehemently opposed by the leading Nonconformists. The vestry decided in favor of the plan, and a poll of the parish was demanded. The poll remained open two days, and ended in a majority of 281 in favor of the motion for obtaining the money by borrowing. At the Easter vestry which followed soon after, Mr. Z. D. Hunt was chosen parish churchwarden, when he requested that he might be allowed to state in what spirit he took office. It appeared to him that the grant of ¬£3,000 should be laid out with the most scrupulous care, and only for those repairs which were necessary in furnishing the poor with religious instruction. Not one shilling of this money should be laid out in decorations or ornamental work of any kind. He was determined to carry out this principle. He believed this view of the case was not a peculiar one, as it was announced by the members of the scheme at the vestry and he had no doubt that the decorations needed in the Church would be done by subscription raised in another way. Pews, galleries, partitions, and other impediments were swept away and sold, and contracts entered into, not only for necessary repairs, but also for the restoration of the interior. The Church was closed, and public worship held in the County Hall. An ecclesiastical census was carried out throughout England on 30 March 1851 to record the attendance at all places of worship. The returns issued by St Mary's at this time was that on the Sunday morning 700 people were in the congregation with 180 in Sunday school giving a total of 880. On Sunday evening it records 800 people were in the congregation with 180 in Sunday school giving a total of 980. On Whitsun 1851, the congregation again met in the Church for public worship, but the restoration was far from being complete. The seats had not been erected, and the worshippers were accommodated with chairs. The restoration of the chancel had not yet been begun. In May 1852, a vestry was convened by the churchwardens for considering the best mode of raising the necessary for reseating the Church and the principle that it should be effected by voluntary contributions was also approved. In the autumn of 1853, the work was revived in earnest, the only delay being caused by disputes raised by some few of the parishioners with regard to their supposed rights to seats, some demanding to occupy the same sites on which their old pews formerly stood. The seating was not completed until 1854, and the finishing touches were not yet given to the nave. Opening services were held about this time. The chancel remained unfinished but the north side of it had been restored at the expense of the Prettyman family. The remainder was left nearly untouched, and for a considerable time it was screened off from the rest of the Church. This restoration was at length carried out in its entirety at a cost of about ¬£1,000, and the chancel was reopened in 1855. The interior of the Church had not long been finished when the idea of crowning the work by the restoration of the exterior was entertained. It was not however until 1865 this was set about in earnest. At a private meeting of the subscribers of the voluntary Church Service Fund, held at the Vestry-place in March of that year, a report of Mr. Scott, dated 7 November 1864, was read. In July following a public vestry was held for submitting Mr. Scott's estimate and report. The difficulty appeared to be the raising of the requisite funds. The question to be decided was the expediency of raising ¬£1,500 by rate, and the remainder by voluntary contribution; the vestry drifted into a discussion on church-rates. Some Churchmen were in favor of making a rate, others were reluctant to launch into a parish squabble. At length Mr, Acton Tindal, who was churchwarden, stated that he accepted this upon the condition that he should not be called upon to levy a church-rate by any compulsory means, a statement which had considerable effect. A Restoration Committee was appointed. Finding the general feeling of the vestry to be opposed to a church-rate, the Committee depended entirely upon the voluntary principle for support, and their appeal for the necessary funds was well responded to. By the following September ¬£1,558 had been subscribed, and the first contract was entered into for the restoration of the west end, which was commenced in the spring of 1866, and as subscriptions came in liberally, it was determined to carry out the work in a more thorough manner than was at first contemplated. All the coverings of rough cast, with the ugly plinths of Roman cement, were removed, and a handsome wall facing of stone substituted; the buttresses were rebuilt on solid foundations reaching down to the rock, and good stone plinths added, following as nearly as possible the old lines. The foundations are now even more substantial than when the Church was first erected. The exterior of the building was extensively repaired and straightened. The completion of the work of restoration was celebrated with thanksgiving services on 28 September 1869, on which occasion Dr. Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, and Dr. Harold Browne, Bishop of Ely, now of Winchester (a native of the town), preached sermons. The proceedings of the day were more than usually of an imposing character; the Church was handsomely and extensively decorated, and the bells rang merrily; between the services a public luncheon was held in the Corn Exchange, which was largely attended. The sum of ¬£800 was subscribed at the celebration of the re-opening, leaving little or nothing remaining, to clear off the whole of the liabilities of the restoration, which, from first to last, amounted to a sum approaching ¬£16,000 (¬£731,000 today). =20th century= St Mary's Church, Aylesbury (1978) St Mary's Church, Aylesbury (Plan of Church 2015) In the 1970s the church was again considered perilously unstable, and at one time appeared to be facing demolition. In January 1976 following storm damage the battlemented parapet at the top of the tower was removed. Funds were raised and the church was closed in April 1978 for the work to commence. The building was virtually gutted so that a major restoration project could start. It was planned over the coming year to spend more than ¬£250,000 to change it to a dual-purpose building for both religious and social activities. The work was completed within a year and a new; internal layout, floor, lighting, heating system etc. was installed. A refectory was constructed in the old South porch of the church moving the main entrance to one on the South transept. =21st century= The building is once again looking at requiring renovation. A large amount of money needs to be spent on re-roofing the South side of the church due to issues with the roof leaking in the South Transept, Chapter House, and Refectory. Churchyard The churchyard of St Mary‚Äôs appears to have been much bigger in the Late Saxon and medieval periods. Skeletons have been found at 12 Church Street in a water main trench and in the cellars of 14 Temple Square and 2 St Mary‚Äôs Square. Documentary evidence suggests that St Mary‚Äôs was the site of a late Saxon minster. Other documentary evidence suggests there was an 11th Century mint based here under Edward the Confessor. Some late Saxon and medieval activity other than burials have been identified in this area, such as tenth to 12th Century ditches, pits and wells, pottery and animal remains at the corner of Temple and Bourbon Streets after house demolition. A Saxon ditch and 12th to 14th century pits and wells were found in the excavations at the Prebendal, the site of a medieval manor. Place-name evidence suggests that Aylesbury may have been the site of a Saxon burh but there is little physical evidence for this apart from the ditch at the Prebendal. Tradition tells us that Aylesbury Churchyard used to be the rendezvous for the idle and dissolute characters of the town. It also tells us that all manners of sports and games were carried on there including cock-shying and the like. Soldiers are reported to have been flogged there. No proofs now exist of such proceedings but it is not at all improbable they occurred. Even as late as at the commencement of the 18th Century it was usual to hold the Borough Elections in the Churchyard. The candidates, their nominators and seconders one after another mounted an old tomb (now removed), to address the constituents. When no contest followed, the proceedings ended here, but in the case of a poll an adjournment was made to the County Hall, where the subsequent proceedings were held. The nominations at the contested election of 1802 were made on this old tomb; this was the last occasion, as after the addition of the Hundred (county division) in 1804, the election no longer being a town matter only, all the proceedings were transferred to the County Hall. Whilst there are no ancient memorials on the north side, there is ample proof that the south side was so crowded with interments that further burials in that part were impossible; and, there being no other parish burial place, it was imperative to make use of the unpopular portion which had been avoided by former generations. The victims of the law at Aylesbury who met with ignominious deaths at the hands of the hangman, and whose bodies escaped the experiments of the anatomist, or were not given over to their friends for interment, were buried \\"behind Church\\", without Christian burial, and so were the bodies of suicides and wayfarers. Aylesbury Churchyard was intersected by several useless public footways, now stopped up; an entrance existed at the western comer, from which a public path ran parallel with the Prebendal wall to the west end of the Church; another path from the same entrance led to the south door. There was a public way in a line with Parson's Fee into Church Row, and an open path from Church Row to the Church. There was also an unauthorised straggling path eastward of the chancel; there was no outside fence, nor did anything like the present palisade exist; a decayed post and rail ran round on the north side, but it was so dilapidated as to be useless. The Churchyard was \\"an open sepulchre\\" the boys of the Aylesbury Grammar School, indeed the boys of the town generally, made a playground of it, till the damage done was so considerable that an old parish beadle was appointed to concentrate his energies in keeping order in the burial place. Aylesbury must not be considered to have been singular in regard to these shortcomings, as they were general in bygone years. As a burial place Aylesbury Churchyard was much overcrowded; and it was with difficulty that grave space could be found for an interment without disturbing the remains of an already existing occupant. It was found imperative to close it, and it was closed at the end of the year 1857; the Cemetery in the Tring Road was then consecrated and opened. Occasionally interments take place in the Churchyard. Music Music performs a role in St Mary's church and community life, particularly at formal worship, and other activities that take place in the building. =Bells= In 1773 a new peal of bells was opened, probably with consecration. Three old bells were exchanged with Pack and Chapman of London for new ones. The total sum subscribed was ¬£106 4s. The saints' bell in the tower is the oldest. It bears the date of 1612, and 'G.T.\\" probably the initials of the bell founder. Today there are a total of nine bells: the sanctus bell, the six from 1773 and two bells from 1850 made by Mears of London. =Organ= The original church organ, a gift of a Mrs Mary Pitches, was accepted at a vestry meeting in February 1782. At the meeting ¬£20 a year was voted to an organist, the sum to be raised by equal taxation on all parish dwelling houses ratable to the poor. Mrs Pitches, at her death in 1800, bequeathed ¬£500 to provide dividends to be paid to an appointed church organist. This organ was built by Green of Lichfield; it was improved in 1858, and probably little of the original instrument now remains. The organ has occupied different positions in the Church. Firstly it was erected in an organ loft gallery which filled the tower and faced the nave with the organist and choir sat at its front. It was afterwards removed to the centre of the west end close to the west door. It remained there for a short time, and at the general restoration of the Church in the 19th century was placed in a chamber or recess in the North transept. JW Walkers had a 2 manual organ which they maintained until the 1978 refit. This was then moved by raising it high into the North transfer (allegedly to allow gymnastics to take place across the floor space underneath, which never dud occur). Hill Norman and Beard took over maintenance and also installeda small 'Chester' pipe organ of 5 extended ranks into the North side West end of the church. The choir also moved to sing from undeneath the West window on a gallery designed for the purpose. The new organ and rebuild was opened by recital organist Peter Hurford in 1979. The organ stopped working several years ago and an electric organ takes its place. The original organ though remains in non-functioning condition. =Choir= The Choir helps to lead worship each Sunday at the Parish Eucharist. It also sings at special civic services, carol services, and weddings. =The Friends of St Mary's= The Friends of St Mary's organises concerts of classical music at the Church, including an extended evening concert about once a month.

Strike Dam, and properties on Simco Road as it continues north, and along the westernmost side of the base until the intersection with SH-67, about north of the base's main gate. History SH-167 was originally part of SH-67. The history of these roads goes back to at least the 1930s, when the first all-weather gravel road connecting Grand View and Mountain Home was built (represented by today's SH-167, SH-67 and SH-51), and can be seen on a 1937 map of the area.Rand McNally and Company, Road map: Idaho, Mont., Wyo., published by Texaco, 1937 When Idaho expanded SH-67 to four lanes for base-bound traffic, the segment south to Grand View was delisted and unsigned from the official state highway system, yet was still maintained by the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), and still referred to in the milepoint log as \\"(SH-67)\\" twice. The highway has since been relisted as SH-167, noting its heritage as part of the original SH-67.

Work  His 2013 book, How Forests Think, has been described by Cambridge Professor of Anthropology Marilyn Strathern as \\"thought-leaping in the most creative sense,\\" and \\"[a] supreme artifact of the human skill in symbolic thinking.\\".Reviews at University of California Press http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520276109 The work draws upon four years ethnographic fieldwork with the Runa in the Upper Amazon in order to challenge the most basic assumptions of anthropological thought. Using the semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce, Kohn proposes that all life forms, not only humans, engage in processes of signification and therefore should be considered as able to think and learn. Arguing that selfhood does not solely belong to humans, Kohn proposes that any entity which communicates through the use of signs can be considered a self, leading to a complex 'ecology of selves' of which humans and nonhumans are both a part.Kohn, Eduardo (2013) How Forests Think: Towards and Anthropology Beyond the Human, University of California Press Kohn's work builds upon a growing body of literature, from authors such as Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, which seeks to take the social sciences beyond the limits of strictly human relations. How Forests Think has been criticized for using a very weak definition of \\"thinking\\": \\"Under such a definition, a wide range of things could be said to think. However, this is no revolutionary discovery; it is simply a semantic shift giving the illusion of novelty.\\" Moreover, it has been argued that Kohn's weak definition of thinking does not account for the phenomenon of anthropomorphism and animism discussed by Philippe Descola and others.

The patronage of the church belonged to the priory of Buckenham until the dissolution of the monasteries. It was later purchased from the Crown by the parishioners. As it stood in the early 19th century, the body of the church consisted of a nave and chancel, with an aisle on the north side only. Philip Browne, writing in 1814, said that, despite its ancient foundation \\"the present building has a modern appearance\\", adding that \\"the inside is very neat, but has no monumental inscriptions. The communion plate is all of silver, and is modern and elegant. Instead of a communion table, the East end is fitted up with a real altar.\\" Excavations in 1972 revealed the sequence of the development of the building from the 11th century to the 16th century. The earliest structure found on the site was an 11th-century nave with an apsidal east end. This was later extended eastwards with a square-ended chancel in the Early English style. The date of the tower is obscure; it seems to postdate the original nave, but may still have been built during the Norman period. The whole church was later rebuilt in the Perpendicular style, except for the tower, which was refaced and increased in height at the same time. Finally the church was enlarged with the addition of the north aisle. Further restorations and alterations followed up until the end of the 19th century. These included the reconstruction of the north aisle arcade with cast iron columns in 1896. The body of the church was largely destroyed in an air raid in January 1942. All that now survives of St Benedict's is the tower, surrounded by a residential development built in 1976. The appearance of the church before its destruction is recorded in a series of photographs taken by George Plunkett in the 1930s. The font from St Benedict's is now in the church of St Mary at Erpingham. Organ The church contained an organ dating from 1860 by Ward. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

The precise classification of the mandible is disputed, some arguing that it represents a new species, Homo tsaichangensis, whereas others believe it to be the fossil of a H. erectus, a archaic H. sapiens or possibly a Denisovan.  History and discovery  The fossil was recovered sometime before 2008 by fishermen working in the Pescadores Channel between the Penghu Islands and mainland Taiwan. It was found 60‚Äì120 meters below the water's surface and about 25 kilometers off the western coast of Taiwan in an area which was once part of the mainland. Sea levels have risen since the last ice age and in consequence have submerged the area where the fossil was recovered. It was described in 2015 by an international team of Japanese, Taiwanese, and Australian scientists. Penghu 1 is currently housed at the National Museum of Natural Science in Taichung. The fossil is stratigraphically dated to younger than 450 kya, based on prehistoric sea-level lowering to either between 190 to 130 kya, or to between 70 and 10 kya.\\"Older low-sea-level events, 225, 240‚Äì280, ?300, 335‚Äì360 and 425‚Äì450 ka cannot be completely excluded as the age for Penghu 1, but such a situation requires explanation for preservation through repeated sedimentary events and the unusual distribution of Crocuta crocuta ultima. Therefore, Penghu 1 is younger than 450 ka, and most likely 10‚Äì70 ka or 130‚Äì190 ka.  Fossil morphology  The fossil consists of a nearly complete right lower jaw with four teeth, including worn molars and premolars. The mandible has a high index of robustness, a robust lateral torus, large molars, and with the help of 3D reconstruction it was revealed to have a large bicondylar breadth. These features help confirm that the fossil was from the middle-late Pleistocene era. The alveoli of its four incisors and right canine have been preserved as well showing their great length. The specimen was assigned to the genus Homo based on it jaw and tooth morphology. The mandible shows a receding anterior surface and lacks a pronounced chin which has helped distinguish it from the species Homo sapiens. However, the fossil exhibited derived traits similar to early Homo habilis including the shortness and width of its jaw. These and other characteristics such as the agenesis of the M3 molar have been sufficient enough evidence to classify the specimen of the genus Homo.  Classification  Although the genus of the Penghu 1 has been widely accepted, there is much discussion on the potential species of the specimen. The Penghu 1 mandible has been described as most similar to Hexian fossils of Homo erectus. Both Penghu 1 and the Hexian mandible share similar crown size, mandibular prominence, and general robustness. As a result of these similarities and their late presence in Eastern Asia, the authors of \\"The first Archaic Homo of Taiwan\\" proposed several models for their existence. The features the mandibles' shared could be explained by either the retention of primitive characteristics of early Asian Homo erectus, a migration of Homo with robust jaws from Africa, inclusion in the species Homo heidelbergensis, or they could have been an adapted form of Homo erectus. However, the species identity or taxonomic relationships lack consensus due to limited material. Co-author Yousuke Kaifu cautioned that additional skeletal parts are needed before species evaluation, but paleontologist Mark McMenamin argued that unique dental characteristics of the jaw were sufficient to establish a separate species, which he dubbed Homo tsaichangensis. McMenamin compares Penghu 1 to Gigantopithecus jaw fragments found in Semedo Village in Central Java, insisting on their relationship being a case of convergent evolution. He refers to these fragments as Gigantopithecus cf. G. blacki, and he explains that this genus was once deemed similar to Homo and Australopithecus until later being recognized as a giant pongid. Gigantopithecus cf. G. blacki and Homo tsaichangensis have similar tooth morphology, suggesting related dietary choices and similar geographical range extensions. The discoveries of Gigantopithecus cf. G. blacki and Homo tsaichangensis also revealed that they both inhabited the Tegal-Penghu Biogeographic Province around 250 kya. McMenamin then forms the conclusion that because they lived in the same province and had access to the same food sources, they both had to adapt to a diet rich in bamboo and other surrounding vegetation to survive. McMenamin agrees with a potential explanation provided by Chang, that the Penghu 1 specimen represents a hominin which evolved from a gracile-jawed Homo erectus to better suit its environment, thus affording it to be classified as a separate species called Homo tsaichangensis. Chinese anthropologists Xinzhi Wu and Haowen Tong are not so eager in the adoption of a new species, tentatively assigning the mandible to archaic Homo sapiens, leaving open the possibility of elevating it to a distinct species should more fossils be discovered. In a 2015 paper, Lelo Suvad accepted the validity of the new species H. tsaichangensis. In 2019 Chen Fahu along with a group of co- authors presented a piece suspecting the Penghu 1 mandible to be a member of the hominid group Denisovans. This conclusion has been supported through its comparison with the Denisovan Xiahe mandible. The Xiahe mandible was discovered on the Tibetian Plateau and is dated to be about 160,000 years old. The Xiahe specimen has similar dental morphology compared to Penghu 1. They share 4 distinct characteristics: their M2's are close in mesiodistal width, they both show the agenesis of the M3 molar, they have a similar unique M2 root structure which relates to modern Asian populations, and the P3 displays Tomes' root, which is rarely found in other fossil hominins.

Magen studied at the Conservatoire National Superieure in Paris, under the guidance of Isabelle Moretti, and where he was a Premier Prix winner. Magen continued his studies at the Juilliard School with Nancy Allen, and earned a Master's degree. In 2006, he became the first, and to date only, Israeli to win the International Harp Contest in Israel. In 2012, Magen won the Burletti-Buitoni Trust award. At Juilliard, Magen met fellow Israeli musicians such as pianist Assaff Weisman and clarinetist Tibi Cziger, and the three of them were among the co-founders of the Israeli Chamber Project. Magen also co-founded the chamber ensemble Tre Voci. He has taught at Brooklyn College. With the 2017-2018 season, Sivan became principal harp of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Magen has recorded commercially for Linn Records, and also for such labels as ECM and Avie.

Plot Giulio Verme is a radical environmental activist who demonstrates against the levelling of a local park to make way for a residential area commissioned by tycoon Giancarlo Cartelloni. Giulio was born of TV-addicted parents who had been severely neglecting him throughout childhood and youth, causing him to develop a hatred for TV and everything related to it. Giulio leaves home at a young age and becomes an environmentalist, animalist, vegan and firmly opposed to any kind of waste. During his studies in environmental science, where he graduates with honors, he meets fellow environmentalist Franca and eventually goes to live with her. As the years go by, Giulio becomes increasingly disillusioned with his inability to raise awareness among the people around him, including Franca herself, whom he judges not coherent enough with her own ideals. After Franca leaves to do volunteering for two weeks, Giulio is visited by his schoolmate Alfonzo, now a door-to-door salesman, who tries to cheer Giulio up by administering a pill that temporarily reduces human brain usage to 2%. Under the influence of the drug, Giulio instantly becomes a thoughtless, vulgar, narcissistic womanizer: he cheats on Franca with his neighbor Sharon, then has Alfonzo take him to an exclusive nightclub, where he impersonates former footballer Ruud Gullit. Giulio later borrows the bouncer's Hummer and crashes it into a tree in the very same park he had been trying to save, then he steals an excavator and uses it to further vandalize the park. The next day Giulio wakes up, having regained his consciousness, to the news that his vandalism acts have earned the park great attention by the media and public opinion, thus putting Cartelloni's levelling plans on hold. Giulio surmises that the only way to raise public awareness is through eco-terrorism. He joins an environmental NGO called \\"The Salmons\\", who propose to contaminate the city's water supply with large amounts of waste, so that citizens would understand the value of water. In order to reach the mindset to commit the reckless act, Giulio obtains more pills from Alfonzo, however he becomes addicted to the drug and is trapped inside his newfound \\"average Italian\\" lifestyle, marrying Sharon and completely overturning his life. Giulio is noticed in this state by the talent scouts of the popular reality show Master VIP and accepts their offer to participate in the competition, eventually working his way up to the finals. Franca returns home and, after learning from Sharon and Alfonzo about the recent events, she takes them with her to the TV studio to attend the Master VIP finale. Master VIP finalists are required to break from their past and everyone connected to it, thereby truly becoming VIPs: Giulio must divorce Sharon and cut ties with Franca and Alfonzo. Initially he complies, until Franca and Alfonzo reveal that he has been acting so recklessly of his own volition: the pills never existed and were a product of Giulio's own imagination to justify his behavior. Giulio briefly comes to his senses, addresses the audience and delivers an incoherent, ranting speech where both his personalities alternately prevail: this impresses Cartelloni, who is a judge in the show and instantly declares Giulio the winner. Giulio hallucinates about his negligent parents and tries to run towards them: he crashes into the camera, faints and falls into a coma. While Giulio is in hospital, a psychologist explains that his mind is manifesting a split personality, due to years of repressing his latent desire to embrace conformity. As Giulio awakens from his coma, he understands the importance of compromise, which is often a necessity to get things done in Italy. He therefore finds a new way to save the park by exploiting his newly gained popularity: with Cartelloni's approval, he launches a new reality show where competitors are tasked with rebuilding the park using gardening tools.

In 1924 she became the first woman to serve on the Pharmaceutical Society's Board of Examiners.  Early life and education  Agnes Thomson Borrowman was born on 7 October 1881, at Penicuik, Midlothian, Scotland to Margaret Davidson Borrowman and Peter Borrowman, a farm bailiff. Her father secured her a four year apprenticeship with pharmacist Mr D.F. Johnstone in Melrose, but as a woman she had to stay out of sight of customers ‚Äúlest the prestige of the business should suffer.‚Äù She found it hard to get a position after completing her apprenticeship, but found her first job with William Lyon at 7 Crichton Place, Leith Walk, Edinburgh, later claiming that the thorough training in practical pharmacy that she received made this the most formative year in her career. She was still not permitted to be seen at the front counter, but concentrated on compounding medicines, in a shop were no proprietaries were stocked. She used her half day holiday each week to study, attending the Edinburgh Central School of Pharmacy, Clyde Street, run by Mr W.B.Cowie. She passed the Pharmaceutical Society (PSGB) Minor exam in 1903 at York Place, the PSGB‚Äôs North British Branch headquarters. She then moved to England, first to Runcorn where she worked for three years managing a pharmacy for Mr J.H. Weston. While there she presented her first research paper ‚ÄòNote on an Arsenic, Iron and Quinine Mixture‚Äô to the PSGB‚Äôs North British Branch in Edinburgh on 17 February 1904. She also wrote to the Pharmaceutical Journal in 30 July 1904 noting gender differences in pay. Whilst at Runcorn, she contributed to the practice exercises for the PSGB Major exam published in the Pharmaceutical Journal, and also had a piece published on ‚ÄòCinchonidine and Cinchonine in a Sample of Quinine.\\" Having subsequently spent three years working for Mr J Beetham Wilson in Dorking, she had saved enough to fulfil her ambition to take the higher PSGB Major exam. She studied at the PSGB School of Pharmacy in Bloomsbury Square, London and registered as a Pharmaceutical Chemist on 6 April 1909.  Career  After registration, Borrowman was appointed research assistant to Professor Greenish at the School of Pharmacy. The School's Professor Crossley then recommended her for a role at the Rubber Growers‚Äô Association of Malaya and Ceylon. She worked on the synthesis of rubber, sheet and crepe rubbers, as imported from the Malay Peninsula and Ceylon, the examination of physical and chemical properties of vulcanised rubber, and of various processes of vulcanisation with a view to their improvement. Her research also covered soil analysis with the object of increasing the yield of latex, examination of distinctive fungi of the rubber plant, cellulose, paper-making, new processes for the production of artificial silk, and examination of possible plant paper-making materials. An article describing her career stated ‚ÄúMiss Borrowman acquired such a facility in the microscopic examination of fibres that she could tell at a glance the proportion or percentage of different fibres in a given paper.\\" She also experimented with paper for detection of forgery. Drawing on her research, she gave a paper on rubber to the London Chemists‚Äô Assistants‚Äô Association and became the first woman to read a paper at an International Rubber Exhibition, when she presented on ‚ÄòThe Viscosity of Latex Hevea Braziliensis‚Äô at the Agricultural Hall, Islington in 1912. During this period, she also attended classes four evenings each week at Borough Poytechnic, Chelsea Polytechnic, and the Cass Institute. She devoted the other nights to reading and searching specifications at the Patent Office library. She also carried out practical work on the 1911 British Pharmaceutical Codex, and later contributed to its 1923 edition. On her father‚Äôs death in 1913, the need to contribute financially to support her family meant that she moved back to retail pharmacy, as her research role was poorly paid. She spent a year in Slough working for Mr Charles Sangster ‚Äúto whom Miss Borrowman expresses special indebtedness for training in modern business knowledge and methods‚Äù. In 1914, she became a joint director of the pharmacy at 17 The Pavement, Clapham with Margaret Buchanan, Sophia J Heywood and Margaret A MacDiarmid, all Pharmaceutical Chemists. As pioneering women pharmacists, they grasped the opportunity to support upcoming women pharmacy students by providing them with practical experience and positive role models in an era when both were in scant supply. One of their apprentices later reminisced ‚ÄúSurely no youngster could have had two more energetic or exacting tutors than the two ‚ÄúMiss B‚Äôs‚Äù ‚Äì Miss Buchanan and Miss Borrowman ‚Äì at that time partners in the somewhat decaying business of Deane‚Äôs of Clapham.‚Äù Miss Borrowman wrote to the Pharmaceutical Journal on 10 December 1917 \\"During the last ten years women in pharmacy have proved by their college careers that they have enthusiasm, that they intend to take first place, that nothing less will satisfy them. Unless I am very much mistaken, the same enthusiasm and determination will carry them through in the business world into which this war [World War One] has given them the entry.\\" She became the sole proprietor of the business after the First World War. By 1923, of the 15 girls trained at 17 The Pavement who studied at the PSGB School of Pharmacy, 14 had taken prizes and scholarships. Under Borrowman‚Äôs leadership, the business was staffed entirely by women. Based on her earlier experiences, virtually everything was made on the premises, and her staff wore her own design of distinctive shop dress with sage green cuffs and collar, in an attempt to overcome prejudice against women pharmacists by presenting a professional appearance. During World War Two, she carried out fire-watching duties. In January 1945, a V2 bomb fell close to the pharmacy in Clapham, and badly damaged the building, probably with Borrowman inside in the air raid shelter that she had had constructed in the old cellars. Borrowman was ‚Äúseverely shaken‚Äù and rested away from London. She later reflected how \\"irksome\\" it was to stand back when her nerves failed her. In the same year, she converted the business into a limited company with Miss H.F. Wells and herself as directors. Miss Wells had served her apprenticeship with Miss Borrowman in 1918. The business was described in a 1954 article: ‚ÄúHigh pharmaceutical standards, judicious arrangement and sheer good housekeeping make the pharmacy a pattern to others, and keep it high in the traditions of its illustrious founder.‚Äù  Professional contributions  Miss Borrowman was associated with the (National) Association of Women Pharmacists from its foundation in 1905. She held numerous committee roles: for the South West Chemists‚Äô Association including as President (1929-31); for the South West PSGB Branch; as Vice-President of her local branch of the Retail Pharmacists‚Äô Union; and as a member of the Pharmacy sub-committee of the British Pharmaceutical Codex Revision Committee (1934-37), the first woman to be appointed to this body. She was the first female member of the Pharmaceutical Society's Board of Examiners from 1924 until her resignation in 1937 when she felt that she wasn‚Äôt able to keep up to date with current pharmaceutics. She surrendered her membership of the British Pharmaceutical Codex Revision Committee at the same time.  Later life and death  Borrowman died on 20 August 1955 in a nursing home at 27 Lawrie Park Road, Sydenham, aged 73. That she left her effects to Sir Hugh Linstead, formerly PSGB Secretary and Registrar, and Jack Rowson, PSGB curator, shows her enduring links with the Society. Her funeral at South London Crematorium, Streatham Vale on 24 August 1955 was attended by Lady Jephcott, Sir Hugh and Lady Linstead, Dr Jack Rowson, Miss HF Wells and the staff of the pharmacy. Borrowman was clearly a formidable and determined character, described in 1954 as having a \\"robust independence of outlook, accepting nothing that wilts under the probing beam of logic.\\" In her obituary, it was stated that ‚ÄúEven in her last few weeks she remained a fighter, and during spells of consciousness would talk of people and things connected with her earlier days in the business for which she had lived and fought for forty years.‚Äù An anonymous tribute to her concluded ‚Äúshe appeared to have an almost indestructible vitality. That she has not lived to any great age is in itself a commentary upon the lavish manner in which she dispersed that vitality.‚Äù In 2019 she was added to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Bred in Virginia, she was sold as a yearling and sent to race in Europe. As a two- year-old she showed promise when finishing second on her debut before winning her next race by twelve lengths. In 1979 she was unbeaten in four races in Ireland, taking the Athasi Stakes, Irish 1,000 Guineas, Pretty Polly Stakes and Irish Oaks, but ran poorly when sent to England for The Oaks and Yorkshire Oaks. She returned to race in the United States as a four-year-old but failed to make any impact in three races. As a broodmare she had some success but produced no major winners. Background Godetia was a \\"most attractive\\" chestnut mare with an elongated diamond-shaped white star and two white socks bred by Whitney Stone at his Morven Stud in Charlottesville, Virginia. Her sire, Sir Ivor was an American-bred colt who was trained in Europe and won The Derby and the Washington, D.C.International in 1968 before standing as a breeding stallion in Kentucky. Sir Ivor's other major winners included Ivanjica, Cloonlara and Bates Motel. Godetia's dam Native Glitter won one minor race but was a full-sister to Shimmy Dancer (winner of the Gazelle Handicap) and a half-sister to Nantallah (sire of Moccasin). At $60,000, she was the cheapest of seventeen yearling bought in the United States by Irish trainer Vincent O'Brien (who had trained Sir Ivor) and his associates in 1977. The filly raced in the colours of the British businessman Robert Sangster and was taken into training by O'Brien at Ballydoyle in County Tipperary. She was ridden in most of her European races by Lester Piggott. Racing career =1978: two-year-old season= Godetia made her racecourse debut in the Gilltown Stud Stakes, a maiden race over seven furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse in September. Her connections appeared to have little confidence in her chances, as she started a 20/1 outsider and was ridden by Vincent Rossiter, one of the stable's lesser-known jockeys. She challenged for the lead in the final quarter mile and finished second of the eighteen runners behind her stablemate Kalamaika. Ten days later she started 1/2 favourite for a maiden over the same distance at Phoenix Park Racecourse and drew away from her opponents in the last two furlongs to win by twelve lengths from Sister Jinks, a filly who had finished third in the Group Three C. L. Weld Park Stakes. =1979: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three- year-old, Godetia won the Athasi Stakes over seven furlongs, beating Icancan by two and a half lengths with Fair Davinia in third. On 12 May, Godetia was made the 4/6 favourite against eleven opponents the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh with the Phoenix Stakes winner Kilijaro (the top-rated two-year-old filly in Ireland in 1978) second choice in the betting on 6/1. Piggott sent the favourite into the lead and tracked across the course to race on the stands side (the left side from the jockeys' viewpoint). In the closing stages she held off several challenges without ever looking in danger of defeat and won by two lengths and a head from La Samanna an Fair Davinia. On 9 June, Godetia was sent to England and started the strongly-fancied second favourite for the 201st running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles on soft ground at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Although she looked impressive in the paddock before the race she ran very poorly, struggling to match the early pace, dropping from contention at half way and finishing ninth of the fourteen runners behind Scintillate. Godetia was dropped back in distance for the ten furlong Pretty Polly Stakes (then restricted to three-year-olds) at the Curragh and won by six lengths from Fair Davinia and twelve others. On 21 July, the filly was moved back up in distance for the Irish Oaks and started the 6/4 favourite ahead of the Maurice Zilber-trained Producer who had won the Prix de Royaumont and the Prix Chlo√© as well as finishing third to Dunette and Three Troikas in the Prix de Diane. Piggott sent Godetia into the lead from the start, set a steady pace, quickened at half way, slowed on the final turn and then went hard for home in the straight. Producer emerged as her only serious challenger, but Godetia prevailed by a length with Queen To Conquer taking third ahead of Senorito Poquito. Timeform described Piggott as being \\"at his formidable tactical best in the race\\" varying the pace in order to blunt Producer's supposedly superior finishing speed. Godetia traveled back to England for the Yorkshire Oaks (then restricted to three-year-olds) over one and a half miles at York Racecourse in August. She again attempted to make all the running but was overtaken three furlongs out and weakened rapidly. Piggott eased her down in the closing stages and she finished last of the five runners behind Connaught Bridge, Senorita Poquito, Reprocolor and Britannia's Rule. Before her defeat at York the filly had been sold privately to George W. Strawbridge Jr. for a reported $1,000,000. =1980: four-year-old season= In 1980 Godetia was transferred to the United States where she raced in the colours of Strawbridge's Augustin Stables and was trained by Jonathan Sheppard but failed to reproduce her European form. She did not reappear until November and was well-beaten in all three of her races. She finished sixth in an allowance race at Meadowlands, fifth behind The Very One in the Grade III Chrysanthemum Handicap at Laurel Park and ninth in an allowance at Meadowlands. Assessment and awards In 1978, the independent Timeform organisation awarded Godetia a rating of 106 p (the \\"p\\" indicating that she was probably capable of making significantly more than normal improvement), twenty-six pounds behind their top-rated two-year-old filly Sigy. In their annual Racehorses of 1978 Timeform praised her \\"great potential\\" and commented \\"We shouldn't be surprised if Godetia were to develop into a leading fancy for the One Thousand Guineas\\". In 1979 the organisation rated her on 119, fourteen pounds inferior to the top three-year-old filly Three Troikas, commenting that her record was that of a poor traveller, who only showed her best form in Ireland. (An alternative explanation is that she was unsuited to left-handed tracks, viz. Epsom and York. This would explain her relatively inferior form when raced at age 4 in America). In the official Irish Handicap, she was rated level with Kilijaro as the best three-year-old filly. The International Classification rated her the eighth-best filly of her generation in Europe. Breeding record Godetia produced at least eight foals and four minor winners between 1984 and 1992. She died in 1994. Her offspring include: *Castle Creek, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1984, sired by Sharpen Up. Won two of seven races. *Norquay, colt, 1985, by Arctic Tern. Second on only start. *Blue Mandolin, chestnut filly, 1986, by The Minstrel. Won once in ten races. *Shout and Sing, colt, 1987, by The Minstrel. Won the Warren Stakes at Epsom from six races. *Ministra, chestnut filly, 1988, by Deputy Minister. Unraced. *River Delta, bay filly, 1990, by Riverman. Won her only race. *Marshall Ney, bay colt (later gelded), 1991, by Danzig Connection. Failed to win in ten races. *Fantasy Flyer, bay filly, 1992, by Lear Fan. Unraced.

Adkins is best known for her work in psychometrics and education testing, particularly in achievement testing. She was the first female president of the Psychometric Society and served in several roles in the American Psychological Association. Early life Adkins was born on April 6, 1912, in Atlanta, a town in Pickaway County, Ohio. Adkins father, George Hoadley Adkins, worked as a businessman as well as a farmer and her mother, Peal F. James-Adkins worked as a teacher at a local school. Dorothy was the couple's third child. Education She attended public school in Atlanta until graduation in 1927. Growing up, Adkins developed a love of music, which led her to later study violin at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. After only one year at the Conservatory, she quit to pursue a degree in mathematics from Ohio State University. Her interest in mathematics quickly drew her to statistics and psychometrics, and she took up psychology. Adkins received a Bachelor of Science (1931) and PhD (1937) in mathematics and psychology from Ohio State. Her PhD was completed under the advisement of Herbert Toops. Toops was a student of Edward Lee Thorndike for psychology and Truman Kelly for statistics. Adkins competed her PhD in 1937 under the title ‚ÄúA Comparative Study of Methods of Selecting Test Items‚Äù. While completing her PhD Adkins began working as a psychometrics assistant examiner under Louis Leon Thurstone at the University of Chicago. Upon completion of her PhD she was eventually promoted to research associate in 1938. During her time at the University of Chicago she was exposed to test development. Career =U.S. Government= Adkins' time as a psychometrics assistant examiner at the University of Chicago and research experience made her a desirable job candidate upon her graduation. In 1940 she was offered a position with the United States government, working as an assistant chief of Research and Test Development for the United States Social Security Board in Washington, D.C. She would later be promoted to the chief of this department. Adkins also worked as Chief of Social Sciences and Administrative Testing and the Chief of Test Development for the U.S. Civil Service Commission while in D.C. from 1940 to 1948. During this time, she received special assignments from the government to the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Georgia, and Thailand. It would be almost a decade before Adkins returned to academia. =University of North Carolina Chapel Hill= In 1948 Adkins accepted a faculty position at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. After only two years at the university, she was promoted to chairman of the department of psychology. Adkins held this position until 1961, and for 11 of those years she was the only female department chair at the university. During this time at the University of North Carolina Adkins served as the Merit System Supervisor for the North Carolina Merit System and was a consultant to the NCMS and the North Carolina State Personnel Board from 1956 to 1959. It was also during this time that she wrote one of her most well known books: Test Construction: Development and Interpretation of Achievement Tests (1960). =Psychometric Society= Adkins was the first female president of the Psychometric Society, serving from 1949 to 1950. The first president of the Psychometric Society was Adkins research advisor at the University of Chicago, L.L. Thurstone, who served from 1935 to 1936. Since the society's founding in 1935, there have only been five female presidents. Following Adkins, there was a 46-year gap before another woman would be appointed that role (Fumiko Samejima 1996). Adkins also served as the managing editor for Psychometrika, the Psychometric Society's publication, from 1950 to 1956. After these assignments ended, she continued to serve as a member of the board of trustees as well as a representative on the Inner-Association Council on Test Reviewing for the Psychometric Society from 1969 to 1972. =University of Hawaii= On the way back from a trip in 1968, Adkins stopped in Hawaii to visit friends and fell in love with the Islands. When she was given the opportunity to teach and research at the University of Hawaii in Educational Psychology, she accepted. While at the University of Hawaii, Adkins was made director of the Center for Research in Early Childhood Education. She was only able to stay in Hawaii until 1974, at which time complicated and ongoing medical conditions forced her to return home to the mainland U.S. =Professional organizations= *Psychometric Society: President (1949-1950) *Psychometric Society: Board of Trustees (1969-1972) *Psychometric Society: Representative on the Inner-Association Council on Test Reviewing (1969-1972) *American Psychological Association: President of the Division of Evaluation and Measurement (1952-1953) *American Psychological Association: Secretary- Treasurer of the Division of Evaluation and Measurement (1949-1951) *American Psychological Association: Recording Secretary (1949-1951) *American Psychological Association: Member of the Board of Directors (1949-1951) *North Carolina Psychological Association: President (1951-1952) Contributions to Psychology and Education Testing =Gumpgookies= Gumpgookies was a method of assessing child motivation to achieve in school, which Adkins created along with Bonnie Baliff. In this method, a child had to choose which of two imaginary Gumpgookie characters he or she identified with. [3] A child choosing one character over another indicated different levels of motivation. This method was used in the Head Start program evaluation in 1968‚Äì1969. =Educational Testing= Over the course of her career, Adkins because interested in new (at the time) statistical techniques of factor analysis. She applied factor analytic techniques in order to examine and better understand curriculum, program evaluation, and affect in children. She published several books examining measurement and analysis in education and achievement tests. Evidence of Adkins influence on the field of achievement testing can be seen in the years surrounding the publication of her 1947 book Construction and Analysis of Achievement Tests. In the first 10 years after publication this book was cited 55 times, with a total of 152 citations, the most recent citation in 2014. Google Ngram can be used to view the number of times the phrase ‚Äúeducation testing‚Äù was used in books in the 20 years prior to and after the publication of Adkins book. Prior to the publication there was a slight decline in the used of the phrase, however after its publication, there was a steady increase in use of the phrase. Following the same trend (but to a lesser degree) the same post publication trend can be seen with a search of ‚ÄúDorothy Adkins‚Äù name. =Selected Works By Dorothy Adkins= *Adkins, D. C. (1947).

Personal life While at the university of North Carolina, Adkins was again colleagues with L.L Thurstone. She became dear friends with Thurstone and his wife, Thelma Thurstone, a friendship that lasted many years. Adkins was highly regarded by her students and colleges. She was known as a precise, dedicated, and excellent teacher, never unprepared for a lecture or meeting. To her friends, Adkins was known as compassionate, though she was always busy. She was known to take time to cook homemade meals/desserts or pick flowers from her garden to bring to friends who were ill. Adkins enjoyed travel, concerts, parties and games. She had two Weimaraner dogs that she loved dearly. In June 1974 Adkins retired from University of Hawaii to Plain City, Ohio, for medical reasons. She eventually wanted to return to teaching at Chapel Hill, but her health never permitted. On December 19, 1975, Dorothy Adkins passed away in her home near her family. In 1976 Thelma Thurstone wrote a biography/memoir for Adkins, which was published in Psychometrika.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on February 4, 2015, and for PlayStation 4 on September 1, 2015. The game follows a robot named B.U.D., who is tasked with growing a plant that will oxygenate its home planet. Players explore an open world, moving B.U.D. and individually using each of its arms to climb and interact with objects. Initially developed by a small team at Ubisoft Reflections for internal release, the game became popular between co-workers and was eventually planned for official release, confirmed in a blog post by Ubisoft on January 22, 2015. It was created using the Unity game engine, and contains procedural animation and physics-based gameplay, which allow the player's movements to adapt to the game's environment. Grow Home received favorable reviews upon release, with critics praising its open world and visuals, while criticizing its short length. A sequel, titled Grow Up, was released on August 16, 2016.  Gameplay  B.U.D. climbing a Star Shoot. Grow Home is an adventure game played from a third person perspective. Players control a robot named B.U.D. (Botanical Utility Droid), and are tasked with oxygenating its homeworld by growing and climbing a \\"Star Plant\\", a giant beanstalk, and harvesting its seeds. Players are able to freely explore an open world, and have the ability to individually make B.U.D.'s left and right hands grab, with a button for each hand. The player can reach a small distance and grab onto any part of the environment, allowing them to push and climb objects. Throughout the game, B.U.D's ship computer entitled M.O.M. speaks to the player, informing them of gameplay objectives. The game allows players to grow \\"Star Shoots\\" from the Star Plant, which act as platforms for the player to traverse. Star Shoots can only be grown for a limited amount of time, and their path of growth can be directed by the player. They can be used to carry the player to various floating islands found throughout the game world. Some islands, called \\"Energy Rocks\\", can be connected to Star Shoots to make the Star Plant grow along a set path. These Energy Rocks become more distant from the Star Plant as the game progresses. Upon growing to certain heights, the Star Plant grows through larger floating islands. These islands, along with the smaller ones surrounding the Star Plant, contain power-up crystals which can be collected to provide B.U.D. with extra abilities. Creatures and other plant life can also be found throughout the game's islands, as well as environmental features, such as caves and water currents. Some parts of the environment, such as leaves growing off of both the Star Plant and Star Shoots that allow the player to jump to greater heights than normally possible, can affect how the player moves throughout the world. Teleportation pads allow the player to move around the world quickly and act as save points. The player also respawns at their last activated teleportation pad if they die, which can be caused by falling long distances, being in too much water for too long, or by the player making B.U.D. self- destruct. Additionally, players can scan various flora and fauna into the teleporters to retrieve data from them. Items can be picked up by the player and stored in B.U.D.'s backpack one at a time, such as flower parachutes that make the player fall more slowly towards the ground, and leaf gliders that allow the player to travel further through the air. Once the player grows the Star Plant to 2000 metres and returns a seed to M.O.M., the main objective is completed, and the player is given the choice of collecting eight more seeds. Completing this final objective unlocks a special suit that allows the player to jump twice as high, and finishes the game. Players are free to explore the world after completion.  Development  Grow Home began development as an experimental project created by an eight-person team at Ubisoft Reflections, initially being launched internally for the staff. After testing the project, management at Ubisoft decided to officially launch the title, which was developed into a full game inspired by Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy and WALL-E. Grow Home has a minimalist, low poly graphical style. It uses procedural animation and physics-based gameplay, which allow objects and the player's actions to adapt to any part of the environment. The developers recommend using a gamepad to play the game, as it gives the player \\"the deepest connection to the gameplay mechanics\\". The game was created using the Unity engine and, unlike other Ubisoft titles, it does not require Uplay to run. After being announced in a post on the official Ubisoft blog on 22 January 2015, Grow Home was released on 4 February for Microsoft Windows via Valve's Steam service, as well as being released on 1 September for PlayStation 4. An OS X version will be released if the PC version sells enough copies. Ubisoft have released multiple updates for the game following release, containing new missions, skins and bug fixes.  Reception  Grow Home received positive reviews upon release. Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating in the 0-100 range, calculated an average score of 75 based on 46 reviews for the PC version, indicating \\"generally favorable\\" reviews. On aggregate website GameRankings, it received a 75% based on 23 reviews for the PC version. According to Steam Spy, by March 2016 around 300,000 copies had been sold on Steam alone. Grow Homes open world was highly regarded by critics. PC Gamer's Erica Webber stated that the game's joy is in discovery. Destructoid's Ben Davis said that he got \\"more than enough enjoyment out of exploring the world\\", and Eurogamer's reviewer Christian Donlan called the game's map wonderfully generous and varied. However, reviewers criticised the game's length, with Davis calling it relatively short and both Webber and Donlan stating that it should only take the player a couple of hours or less to complete the game's campaign, although Webber said that the game has a great pace. IGN's Brandin Tyrrel also said that there's little reason to return to the game after completing the main campaign. The game's visuals were also commended, with Tyrrel calling the game's world gorgeous and vivid, as well as calling its procedurally generated animation a \\"fantastic example of how movement can speak volumes more than words\\". However, he also stated that the animation system sometimes caused B.U.D.'s limbs to knot themselves into a state of \\"unnatural contortion\\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun's John Walker said that the main character's movement is \\"deeply involved in the world\\", calling its animation the reason the game is \\"so special\\". Critics were divided on the game's control scheme. Donlan wrote that Grow Home is the best rock-climbing game he has ever played, stating that the \\"initially bewildering\\" controls allow the player to move through the world \\"with real skill\\". Davis called it the most entertaining aspect of the game, but also stated that the walking controls were awkward at times. Webber said that the climbing controls caused her wrist strain, and that the walking controls were \\"cute until the first time you overshoot or go skidding off the edge\\".

Founded by the largest rooftop solar energy companies in the United States of America, TASC represents the vast majority of the rooftop solar market. Its members include: Demeter Power Group, SunTime Energy, Geostellar, Inc., LGCY Power, Sunrun, and Solar Universe. TASC member companies are responsible for thousands of jobs and hundreds of thousands of rooftop solar installations on homes, schools, businesses, and government buildings across the country. According to recent Center for American Progress (CAP) studies, rooftop solar systems are now seeing overwhelming adoption in middle-class neighborhoods with median incomes ranging from $40,000 to $90,000.  Overview  = EEI Publishes \\"Disruptive Challenges\\" = In January 2013, the utility trade association Edison Electric Institute (EEI) issued a report titled ‚ÄúDisruptive Challenges: Financial Implications and Strategic Responses to a Changing Retail Electric Business‚Äù. The report describes the increasing popularity of consumer-driven rooftop solar, energy efficiency, and demand response as a ‚Äúvicious cycle.‚Äù It details how utilities view rooftop solar as a ‚Äúdisruption‚Äù to their current business model, which guarantees utilities specific profit margins from large infrastructure projects funded by ratepayers. Peter Kind of Energy Infrastructure Advocates, the author of the report, makes recommendations on how electric utilities can defend against these ‚Äòdisruptive challenges.‚Äô TASC and others in the solar industry have been working since 2013 to defend against utility attacks on core rooftop solar policies across the country. = Targeted Attacks = A primary target of utility attacks is net energy metering, or ‚ÄòNEM‚Äô. Net metering provides full retail credit to residents, businesses, schools, and other public agencies when their solar systems export surplus energy to the grid. The utility then sells this surplus energy to other customers nearby. Utility companies are attacking NEM to block the growth of rooftop solar, a strategy that has been highly publicized in the press. Another utility strategy is to introduce legislation to monopolize the rooftop solar market. In 2014, utilities in South Carolina and Washington pushed legislation with this intention. TASC successfully lead efforts to defeat both attempts. = VOSTs, FITs and Their Weaknesses = Utilities also advocate for Value of Solar Tariffs (VOSTs) and Feed-in Tariffs (FITs). As revealed by national law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, VOSTs create hidden taxes for consumers. In addition, VOSTs create annual market uncertainty that can hurt solar businesses, and they eliminate a customer‚Äôs right to actually use the power they generate. This right to use the power produced from solar panels on-site is philosophically important for many solar customers. With VOSTs and FITs, utilities control a homeowner‚Äôs solar energy. The homeowner has to sell all of their solar power to the utility as it‚Äôs produced. They buy all of the electricity they consume from the utility. The utility determines the price the homeowner receives for the solar power, and the homeowner ‚Äì as indicated by the Skadden tax memo from ‚Äì could be required to pay taxes on these payments. The payment price fluctuates according to utility calculations, so it is unpredictable from year to year. = Barclays PLC Downgrade = Following the recent, concerted attacks from utilities, in May 2014, Barclays PLC downgraded the entire electric utility sector due to a confluence of declining cost trends in distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation and because residential-scale power storage is likely to disrupt the status quo. The Barclays report highlights that \\"regulators are ultimately answerable to voters, and the latter are unlikely to tolerate a long halt in their ability to access a clearly beneficial product.\\"  Member Companies  The founding members of TASC represent the vast majority of the nation‚Äôs rooftop solar market and include Demeter Power Group, Silevo, SolarCity, Solar Universe, Sunrun, and ZEP Solar.

Early life  In 1889, Bishop was born in New York as Katharine Scott, to Walter and Katherine Emma (Campbell) Scott. She attended the Somerville High School (Massachusetts) for high school and later received her undergraduate degree from Wellesley College in 1910. After taking premedical courses at Radcliffe College, Bishop went on to graduate from The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and earned her medical degree in 1915.  Discovery of Vitamin E  After graduating from medical school, Bishop moved to Berkeley to teach histology in the anatomy department at the University of California Medical School until 1923. During this time, Bishop did her medical research with anatomist and endocrinologist Herbert McLean Evans. Together, they published a monograph on the vital staining of connective tissue cells. The discovery of Vitamin E came as a result of the study of the reproductive cycle of rats. After establishing a standard diet for the rats to maintain their regular reproductive cycle, Bishop and Evans started experimenting with dietary deficiencies. In 1923, they found a previously unknown factor that is vital for reproduction. When the rats were fed with a diet where lard was the only source of fat, though grew healthily, the female rats were unable to carry babies full term due to the breakdown of the placentas, and the male rats became sterile since the sperm-forming cells in the testes would deteriorate. Initially called \\"Factor X\\", Bishop and Evans narrowed down that this factor came from the lipid extract of lettuce and wheat germ. The name \\"Vitamin E\\" later came after Vitamin D.  Later life  From 1924 to 1929, Bishop worked as a histopathologist at the George Williams Hooper Foundation for Medical Research in San Francisco. After her marriage and birth of her two daughters, she spent two years studying public health at the University of California Medical School. In mid-1930s, Bishop became a practicing physician and anesthesiologist at St. Luke's Hospital in San Francisco. She accepted a position at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, California in 1940, and worked there until her retirement in 1953. She died at home in Berkeley in 1975.

Together they were instrumental in developing agar as a medium for culturing microorganisms.  Biography  Hesse was born in 1850 in New York City to Gottfried Elishemius, a wealthy import merchant, and his wife, Ceclie Elise. She met her husband and research partner, Walther Hesse, in 1872 while in Germany. They were engaged in 1873, and married in 1874 in Geneva.  Research contributions  Hesse worked in an unpaid capacity to assist her husband through preparing bacterial growth media, cleaning equipment and producing illustrations for publications. In 1881, while her husband was working in the laboratory of German physician and microbiologist Robert Koch, Hesse suggested that agar was preferable to gelatin for cultivating bacteria. She was aware of the properties of agar as a gelling agent that maintained its gel properties at warm temperatures through using it at home to make puddings and jellies. A neighbour who had lived in Java had introduced agar to her when she lived in the United States. This led to Koch using agar to cultivate the bacteria that cause tuberculosis. From p. 225: \\"Die Tuberkelbacillen lassen sich auch noch auf anderen N√§hrsubstraten kultiviren, wenn letztere √§hnliche Eigenschaften wie das erstarrte Blutserum besitzen. So wachsen sie beispielsweise auf einer mit Agar-Agar bereiteten, bei Blutw√§rme hart bleibenden Gallerte, welche einen Zusatz von Fleischinfus und Pepton erhalten hat.\\" (The tubercule bacilli can also be cultivated on other media, if the latter have properties similar to those of congealed blood serum. Thus they grow, for example, on a gelatinous mass that was prepared with agar-agar, which remains solid at blood temperature, and which has received a supplement of meat broth and peptone.)

Recording After 15 years with Mercury, Lewis made the switch to Elektra in 1978, and the move seemed to rejuvenate him. He had grown tired with the formulaic overproduction that his recent albums on Mercury had been layered with and began recording new material with producer Bones Howe in January 1979 in Los Angeles. Howe, who had worked on Elvis Presley's celebrated 1968 comeback special and had produced albums by Tom Waits and Juice Newton, assembled a more stripped-down band (including Elvis's former guitarist James Burton) that resembled what Lewis used on the road. The resulting album was the best Lewis had made in years. The single \\"Rockin' My Life Away,\\" would only make it to number 18 on the country charts but would become a live favorite and another in a growing list of songs that were written specifically to celebrate Jerry Lee's uncompromising rock and roll attitude. Another impressive track was \\"Who Will The Next Fool Be,\\" a gin-soaked Charlie Rich tune that Lewis confidently makes his own (\\"Pick it, James,\\" he oozes to Burton on the instrumental bonephone break, before rasping, \\"Play your fiddle, Mr. Lovelace,\\" to long- time band member Ken Lovelace). Sonny Throckmorton, who had written Lewis's last big hit \\"Middle Age Crazy,\\" mines similar territory on \\"I Wish I was Eighteen Again,\\" and Lewis also gives spirited performances on Arthur Alexander's \\"Every Day I Have To Cry\\" and \\"Rita Mae,\\" marking the first time he'd ever recorded a song written by Bob Dylan. This was a tumultuous time for Lewis, whose father Elmo was ailing and would die later that year. Lewis himself had been hospitalized several times for stomach ailments brought about by his pills and carousing, and in the spring of 1979 he was countersued for divorce by his wife Jaren Pate, who accused him of years of cruelty and drunkenness. The IRS was also after him for unpaid taxes. Reception Jerry Lee Lewis was acclaimed critically but was not a commercial success, peaking at number 23 on the Billboard country albums chart and limping to number 186 on the Top 200. Writing in the liner notes to the 2006 career retrospective A Half Century of Hits, country music historian Colin Escott calls the album \\"an astonishing return to form,\\" likening Lewis's performance on \\"Who Will The Next Fool Be\\" to \\"a poisoned dart hurled at every woman who had done him wrong.\\" In his authorized biography Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, Rick Bragg also praises the album: \\"While his voice was showing its scars and the words were frequently obscure, Jerry Lee delivered them with commitment, and the beat was pure Louisiana boogie-woogie.\\" Track listing #\\"Don't Let Go\\" (Jesse Stone) #\\"Rita May\\" (Bob Dylan, Jacques Levy) #\\"Every Day I Have to Cry\\" (Arthur Alexander) #\\"I Like It Like That\\" (Allen Toussaint, Chris Kenner) #\\"Number One Lovin' Man\\" (Jim Cottengim) #\\"Rockin' My Life Away\\" (Mack Vickery) #\\"Who Will the Next Fool Be\\" (Charlie Rich) #\\"(You've Got) Personality\\" (Harold Logan, Lloyd Price) #\\"I Wish I Was Eighteen Again\\" (Sonny Throckmorton) #\\"Rocking Little Angel\\" (Jimmie Rogers) Personnel *Jerry Lee Lewis - vocals, piano *James Burton - electric guitar, dobro *Kenny Lovelace - acoustic & electric guitar, violin *Tim May - acoustic & electric guitar *Dave Parlato - bass *Hal Blaine - drums, percussion *Ron Hicklin Singers - backing vocals *Bob Alcivar - string arrangements, conductor References Category:Jerry Lee Lewis albums Category:1979 albums Category:albums produced by Bones Howe Category:Elektra Records albums ","title":"Jerry Lee Lewis (Elektra album)"},{"id":"45295514","text":"We are all Americans (allegiance) is a song written during World War I with music composed by Carrie Jacobs-Bond and lyrics written by Fanny Hodges Newman.

The system was first noted by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) as a weak tropical disturbance northeast of Tokelau in mid-December 1986. The system developed further as it moved southwest over the next few days, and it was classified as Tropical Cyclone Raja on 23 December. The newly named system slowed and unexpectedly recurved southeast towards the French territory of Wallis and Futuna on 24 December. Over the next two days, Raja interacted with what would become Severe Cyclone Sally and executed a tight loop, passing within of Futuna. The system peaked as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on 28 December, with estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). The storm turned southwest the next day and threatened Fiji, where it passed within of Vanua Levu and near (or over) several smaller islands in the Lau group during the following day. Raja gradually weakened over the next few days as it moved south of Fiji; it was last noted on 5 January 1987 after it filled up over the north Tasman Sea. Raja caused one death as it impacted the island nations of Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna, Tonga and Fiji. Gusty winds and rough seas associated with the system caused extensive damage to crops, coastal installations and buildings in Tuvalu, and flooded low-lying areas. The island of Futuna was the worst hit, with crops, coastal installations and buildings damaged or destroyed by the system. Raja affected the main islands of Fiji twice between 24 and 30 December, and was responsible for the worst flood of the Labasa River since 1929. As a result of the damage to Fiji and portions of Polynesia, the name Raja was retired from the South Pacific naming lists. Meteorological history The South Pacific convergence zone was active in the middle of December 1986, with a mid-latitude upper-level trough of low pressure which extended into the tropics. A westerly wind burst between Tokelau and Kanton Island resulted in a tropical disturbance developing to the northeast of Tokelau. The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began to monitor the disturbance as a shallow tropical depression on 21 December, when the system was about east of the island of Funafuti, Tuvalu. At that time, the system was beyond the range of any reporting stations; its circulation was weak and ill-defined, which meant that there was considerable uncertainty about the location of its center. The depression moved southwest and passed near the Tuvaluan atoll of Nukufetau, as it slowly deepened and organised over the next 36 hours. The system was named Tropical Cyclone Raja by the FMS on 23 December; the United States Naval Western Oceanography Center (NWOC) began issuing advisories, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 04P. During that day, the system slowed as it approached Rotuma; the subtropical ridge of high pressure weakened, and widespread falling pressure was recorded across the Pacific. Raja then unexpectedly re-curved southeast and began moving towards the French territory of Wallis and Futuna on 24 December. Satellite imagery the next day indicated that the system had developed an eye, and it passed within of Futuna. Raja reached hurricane strength on 26 December, as it slowed and began to interact with what would become Severe Tropical Cyclone Sally. Over the next two days, Raja approached to within of Sally in an anticlockwise cyclonic loop as it continued to intensify. The system also passed about southeast of Futuna, as it re-curved east and began to threaten Fiji. The FMS estimated on 28 December that Raja had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 150 km/h (90 mph), which made it a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. The system turned southwest that day, in response to a trough of low pressure developing over (and south of) Raja and Sally. It passed within of Cikobia and Udu Point on Vanua Levu on 29 December, before it passed over or near several smaller Fijian islands in the Lau Group while beginning to turn south. The NWOC estimated that Raja had peaked in intensity at this time with one-minute sustained wind speeds of 165 km/h (105 mph), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Over the next few days, Raja gradually weakened as it moved over cooler waters south of Fiji and its outflow became restricted before it degenerated into a depression during 1 January. The depression passed under a subtropical jet and moved west, where it became part of a blocking pattern over New Zealand. The system was last noted on 5 January, after filling over the north Tasman Sea. Effects Severe Tropical Cyclone Raja was responsible for a single death as it impacted Fiji and parts of Polynesia, before its name was later retired from the South Pacific lists of tropical cyclone names. When the FMS began monitoring Raja as a tropical depression on 21 December, they issued a tropical cyclone alert for Tuvalu. Although the system moved southwest and affected Tuvalu as expected, it failed to deepen as quickly as anticipated. However, its strong, gusty winds and high seas caused extensive damage to crops, coastal installations and buildings and flooded low-lying areas on the island nation. Raja was expected to begin moving southeast after it passed near Rotuma on 24 December, which prompted the FMS to issue a tropical cyclone alert for the Tongan islands of Niuafo ªou and Keppel. Gale warnings were issued on 25 December for the two islands and remained in place until 28 December, when the system had turned southwest and moved well away from the islands. A tropical cyclone alert was issued for the islands of southern Tonga on 29 December, when the possibility arose that Raja would turn southeast and affect central and southern Tonga. A gale warning was subsequently issued for Tongatapu and the Nomuka group of islands before all warnings for Tonga were cancelled on 30 December. =Wallis and Futuna= Raja impacted the French overseas territory of Wallis and Futuna on 25‚Äì29 December, and was responsible for one death as well as extensive damage to the islands' crops, coastal installations and buildings. A storm warning was issued by the FMS for Futuna on 24 December and remained in place until 28 December while the system made a cyclonic loop near the island. The system brought gale-force winds to Wallis, and was thought to have brought hurricane-force winds to Futuna; this could not be verified since the weather station was blown down. It also generated high seas, flooding, landslides and a storm surge which damaged Futuna's grass airstrip. On 26 December, a record 24-hour rainfall total of and a minimum pressure of were recorded at the Maopoopo weather station on Futuna. The Maopoopo station also recorded a wind gust of before its anemometer was destroyed, and a record wind gust of was recorded in Wallis' Hihifo District. The record was broken during Severe Tropical Cyclone Evan in December 2012, when a wind gust of was recorded at the Hihifo aerodrome. Communications between the islands were lost on 27 December, before an intermittent radio link was established later that day to transmit damage reports. The reports indicated that Futuna was the worst affected, with severe damage reported to well-built houses; less well- built houses were completely destroyed. About 80 percent of the island's crops were destroyed, and the territorial administration building, police headquarters and hospital were severely damaged. The radio link failed on 28 December and Futuna was cut off from the rest of the world. Relief supplies, including food, medical supplies and other materials, were immediately dispatched from French Polynesia and New Caledonia. Two Transall military transport aircraft attempting to deliver of relief materials to Futuna were diverted to Wallis due to poor visibility. Plans were made to transport some of the aid on the cargo ship Mona-III when the seas surrounding the islands subsided. Aid arrived on Futuna on 31 December after a dismantled Puma aircraft was airlifted to Wallis from New Caledonia, reassembled and flown to the island. The aircraft, which also carried French Secretary of State for the South Pacific Gaston Flosse, evacuated seriously injured individuals to Wallis. On 1 January, the French Navy ship Jacques-Cartier left Noumea with earth-moving equipment for Futuna. During a 24-hour visit to the island nation on 6‚Äì7 February 1987, French Minister of Overseas Departments and Territories Bernard Pons announced that Futuna would receive () in aid and the ban on aid to Vanuatu was overturned. A military detachment was deployed to the islands to assist in rehabilitating the main infrastructure the day after the minister's visit. The European Economic Community supplemented the French funds, providing ‚Ç†60,000 from the European Development Fund for Construction and enabling the replacement of fishing boats destroyed by the cyclone. It took the island nation about five years to rebuild and recover from Raja's effects. =Fiji= Tropical Cyclone Raja (left) and the precursor to Sally (right) interacting on 26 December Raja impacted Fiji between 24 and 30 December, where it was responsible for () in damage, one death and the worst flood of the Labasa River since 1929. It was considered to be one of the worst tropical cyclones on record to hit Fiji. On 23 December, the FMS issued a tropical cyclone alert for the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and warned that gale-force winds were possible on the island within the next 24 hours. The FMS issued a storm warning for Rotuma and a tropical cyclone alert for the rest of Fiji later that day, since it was thought that the system would continue moving southeast towards the island nation. Raja passed west of Rotuma on 24 December, and gale-force winds and extensive damage to houses, vehicles, coastal roads and crops were reported. The tropical cyclone alert was gradually replaced that day with a gale warning for islands in Fiji's Northern Division the following day, since Raja was expected to pass close enough to trigger gale-force winds. The system passed northwest of the Udu Point meteorological station on 25 December, with estimated winds of . All warnings were gradually cancelled by the FMS on 25 and 26 December, as Raja moved east towards the Tongan island of Niuafo'ou. It became clear that the storm posed another threat to Fiji on 27 December, since it had begun moving west the previous day. Fiji was put on alert and the FMS issued gale warnings for several islands, including northern Vanua Levu, Cikobia, Qelelevu and Taveuni. The National Emergency Services Committee was mobilised that day to coordinate incoming data and oversee preparations for Raja. The FMS issued gale, storm and hurricane warnings for the island nation, while public and private broadcasting companies coordinated to disseminate information about Raja by radio over the next few days. Residents of the archipelago went to caves or evacuation centres, which were thought to be strong enough to withstand hurricane-force winds. Severe damage was reported in areas of Fiji which received hurricane-force winds, including parts of Vanua Levu, the Koro and the Lau group of islands. Other parts of the island nation also incurred damage from a combination of gale- to hurricane-force winds, a storm surge of , heavy rain and wind waves. Severe damage was reported to crops, communication facilities, buildings, roads, seawalls, wharves, jetties and other coastal installations in low-lying areas. Damage to houses were reportedly less severe than in previous tropical cyclones, which was attributed by the Fijian minister for home affairs to better-constructed homes which had replaced those destroyed by previous storms. One person drowned on the island of Lakeba as he and two others tried to move a boat to a safer anchorage. Raja was responsible for the worst flooding of the Labasa River since December 1929, with the gauge at Labasa's civic centre peaking at . The flooding in Labasa was later attributed to a blocked drainage system and exceptionally high tides. A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion plane flew to Fiji on 31 December, enabling Fijian authorities to conduct aerial surveys and damage assessments on 1 and 2 January. The flights indicated that damage to the island nation was less widespread than feared. A half-submerged ferry was found on a reef near the island of Nairai; it was later identified by Fijian authorities as the Romada, which had taken 60 passengers to the island for Christmas. The ferry sank with only the captain and the engineer aboard, and they reached shore in a life raft. On 2 January, the Fijian government announced its willingness to accept assistance and made specific requests for relief. United States Ambassador Carl Edward Dillery exercised his disaster- assistance authority, donating US$25,000 to the government of Fiji. Other donations included about FJ$100,000 from New Zealand, AU$100,000 from Australia, AU$65,000 from the United Nations Development Programme and ‚Ç†300,000 from the European Commission. On 5 January, World Vision Australia launched an appeal for AU$15,000 to send emergency food rations and other aid for 1,000 families to the island nation. The funds were used for short-term relief from Raja's effects, and included the purchase of food supplies, transport, sanitation equipment and agricultural tools and equipment. On 4 February, the Australian government announced that it would give to Fiji in addition to its previous emergency aid of AU$100 000.

Born in Nieszawa, she was the fifth daughter of King Casimir IV of Poland of Poland and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria. Life From November 1479 until the autumn of 1484 Anna lived in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with her family, and later accompanied her parents on trips around Poland and Lithuania. There is no information about her early years and education. Casimir IV wanted to arrange a marriage between Anna and Archduke Maximilian of Austria, son and heir of Emperor Frederick III. In the spring of 1486 Polish envoys arrived to Cologne to discuss the proposal and even showed a portrait of the princess, but the Habsburgs didn't show interest in the matter. During 1489-1490 Miko≈Çaj Ko≈õcielecki, Bishop of Che≈Çm, arrived to Barth to begin the negotiations for a marriage between Anna and Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania. On 7 March 1490 in the city of Grodno, was signed an agreement about this matter by Adam Podewils (Governor of Bia≈Çogard), Werner Schulenburg (Governor of Stettin (Szczecin)) and Bernard Roth as a representative of the Order of Malta. At the same time, was performed the marriage by proxy of Anna and Bogislaw X, who was replaced in the ceremony by Podewils. Casimir IV gave his daughter the amount of 32,000 Hungarian z≈Çoty as a dowry, which were secured from the towns of Lauenburg, Lƒôbork and Byt√≥w. On 1 February 1491 Bogislaw X gave his bride as a wedding gift the districts of R√ºgenwalde, Bia≈Çogard and Greifenberg. The complete payment of the princess' dowry lasted several decades. On 3 May 1526 King Sigismund I the Old received from Bogislaw X's sons the sum of 14,000 z≈Çoty in exchange for the transfer of Lƒôbork and Byt√≥w. The other 18,000 z≈Çoty were paid probably only in 1533. Anna arrived to ≈Åƒôczyca around 15 January 1491, from where she began her trip with her family to Pomerania. On 2 February in the city of Stettin took place the wedding ceremony between her and Bogislaw X. The event was very sumptuous and was attended, among others, by Sophie, Dowager Duchess of Pomerania and mother of Bogislaw X, and his brothers-in- law, Dukes Magnus II and Balthasar of Mecklenburg. Monument of Bogislaw X and Anna. Ducal Castle, Szczecin. Commemorative plaque at Eldena Abbey. At the time of her wedding, Anna was only 14 years old. She was the second wife of the Duke of Pomerania, whose first marriage with Margaret of Brandenburg (d. 1489) was turbulent and childless. For Bogislaw X, his new marriage reinforced his connections with Poland. His long dispute with Brandenburg ended in the sign of a treaty on 26 March 1493 in the city of Pyritz (Pyrzyce); as a mediator in this agreement, participated the Polish King John I Albert as a request of his brother-in-law. The Ducal couple resided mainly in Stettin, where Bogislaw X renewed and expanded the local Castle. On 16 December 1496 Bogislaw X left his domains to support Emperor Maximilian I in his war against King Charles VIII of France. Later, he went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, from which he returned only on 12 April 1498. During his absence, the Regency of the Duchy was exercised by Benedikt von Waldstein, Bishop of Cammin and Chancellor Georg Kleist; however, Anna also participated in the government with minor documents, according to historian Fryderyk Pap√©e.M. Duczmal: Jagiellonowie. Leksykon biograficzny, Pozna≈Ñ-Krak√≥w 1996, p. 41. In the autumn of 1503 a rebellion from Stettin subjects, forced Bogislaw X to moved his family firstly to Gartz and later to Ueckerm√ºnde Castle, where Anna gave birth to her youngest child. According to the reports of chronicler Thomas Kantzow, Anna became ill after she arrived to Ueckerm√ºnde, because there the walls are recently covered with lime, and this hit her on the heart.M. Duczmal: Jagiellonowie. Leksykon biograficzny, Pozna≈Ñ-Krak√≥w 1996, p. 42. Modern historians, based on reports of chronicler Joachim von Wedel, speculated that the real cause of her death could be pneumonia or tuberculosis. Anna died on 12 August 1503 in Ueckerm√ºnde and was buried at Eldena Abbey in Greifswald. The burial place of the Duchess was commemorated with a plaque placed in the ruins of the Abbey.

(commonly branded as Starcast initially, then STN, prior to launch, then Star from its launch up to the network's shutdown), was an attempt at a fifth broadcasting network based in Orlando, Florida. The network was notable as the first television network to have featured exclusively direct response commercials and infomercials among standard programming. Star Television Network featured classic, though cheaper and lesser-known, 1950s and 1960s programming, movies and game shows under the TV Heaven slogan, with direct response infomercials rounding out the schedule. The network expected to buy newer programs and originate their own programming once on a firm operating status. Star Television Network was facing competition from the Home Shopping Network and Fox, which went after the bigger markets. In light of this, the network explained that its key advantage is in terms of operating costs for the station, in which a station affiliating with the network could save about 90% on their programming costs, and a national advertiser advertising on the network could pay about 68% of the major network rates. History The network was introduced under the Starcast branding in October 1987 as needing $15 million to launch and had just started contacting potential affiliates. The network expected to sign up 30 stations by the April 1989 launch date and have 18 hours of broadcasting a day. After the Black Monday stock market crash in October 1987, Starcast's investors pulled out. By January 1988, the company had 70 stations willing to sign on to the network. By April 1989 (the projected launch date), the network, now under the STN branding (having changed from Starcast), pushed back their launch to July due to programming negotiations and financing hold ups. 64 stations had provisionally signed on as affiliates in markets like Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Jacksonville, Florida and Orlando to an estimated reach of 40 million households. The network was then in talks with an additional 33 stations. At this time, an affiliation fee ranging from $2,750 to $60,000 annually would be paid by the stations based on their market size instead of the standard network payments to affiliates. 36 minutes a day would be allocated for advertising sold by the network, with the remainder given to its affiliates. STN missed the July launch due to lack of additional funding and set a new September 1 deadline for enough affiliates to sign on for a possible November 1 launch. The network expected to be based at the then-new Universal Studios Florida in Orlando. At this time, the network restructured its affiliate agreement in dropping the annual carriage fee for the addition of some infomercials and a refundable deposit of $1,500 to $175,000 based on the station's size. The number of affiliates at launch and infomercials was a requirement to bring on replacement investor Dale W. Lang, owner of Lang Communications, which then owned several magazines including Success and Working Woman magazine. The infomercials would bring a steady source of income for the network and were mostly to be provided by Quantum Marketing International. Missing the September 1, 1989 affiliate total deadline, the network, under the Star branding (its second & final name change), pushed back its launch to September 1990. As of August 12, 1990, there were 21 signed stations reaching 13.7 million households. Also, Star moved operations to a rented studio in Winter Park, Florida. Additionally, broadcasting hours were reduced to 8 hours a day, plus 4 hours of infomercials. The network expected to have revenue reach $100 million in its second year of operations. By July 1990, Star had been granted a federal permit for a station in Austin, Minnesota. Star launched on September 29, 1990 with 10 affiliates reaching 9 million homes, as the additional stations were not ready or failed to receive FCC approval. With fewer stations, the network sold less through the infomercials, thus not meeting company goals. The infomercial companies were having their own problems, and thus unable to produce newer shows. Lang could not add more funding into the company due to difficulties at Lang Communications. Lang and the company sought out other investors, to no avail. The Star Television Network ceased operations on Monday, January 14, 1991 at 4:00 a.m. EST. All 25 staffers working for the network were laid off. Programming Star Television Network's schedule was of four hours of infomercials and eight hours of classic shows under the TV Heaven slogan. Some of the programs known to have aired on Star included: * The Invaders * The Life of Riley * My Little Margie * The Rebel Honey West, Judge Roy Bean, Mr. and Mrs. North, and Richard Diamond, Private Detective were also announced as part of Star Television Network's line-up in August 1988, though it was unknown if these series had aired. Infomercials are listed in schedules under various names, such as Star Showcase, Star Opportunities, Star Collections, Star Sensations, Star Innovations, Market Place, Morning Star and Direct to You. As with other networks, affiliates fill the rest of the time with their own local and syndicated programming, as well as sports, which would preempt Star Television Network programming.

Content  The film examines the ten televised debates between Buckley and Vidal in August 1968 that were moderated by anchorman Howard K. Smith during ABC News coverage of the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It especially focuses on a specific incident of on-air insults exchanged by Vidal and Buckley during the Democratic convention, and follows their subsequent thoughts and actions, including articles each wrote for Esquire magazine and the years-long litigation that resulted. It also expands on the impact of these debates on the beginning of modern American punditry.

Her denouncement of her traffickers led to the breaking up of the Jewish human-trafficking network from Poland, Zwi Migdal, which in the early 20th century operated a large white-slavery ring. Early life Liberman was born on 10 July 1900 in Berdichev in the Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire. According to the Jewish Women's Archive, she moved to Warsaw in Russian Poland with her family as a child. In 1919, she married Yaacov Ferber, a Warsaw tailor, according to Jewish rites. Ferber emigrated to Argentina and she followed him to Tapalqu√©, Buenos Aires province, with her two sons in 1922. Her husband died of tuberculosis soon after their arrival. Needing economic support and not knowing Spanish, Liberman left her children with a foster family and looked for a job in Buenos Aires. Liberman later kept the existence of her children a secret, and her children were unaware of her subsequent history. Slavery It is unclear how Liberman got involved in the criminal network, as there are very few records of her early life, and she concealed parts of her personal history. Unable to find work as seamstress, she was either forced into or voluntarily entered into prostitution, through a Jewish human trafficking network named Zwi Migdal. One possibility is that her sister and brother-in-law belonged to the organization. This network worked in Europe under the semblance of a Jewish Mutual Aid Society which lured girls and young women to Argentina where they were exploited sexually. Exactly how it occurred is uncertain, but Liberman ended up working for a caftan (pimp) named Jaime Cissinger, whom she paid for protection. For at least four years Liberman was a captive of the human trafficking network. She managed to save money to buy her liberty, possibly with help from someone else. She opened a shop in Callao road but Zwi Migdal started to harass and threaten her to avoid her example being copied by other female captives. A member of the Zwi Migdal, Jos√© Salom√≥n Korn, fooled her with a false marriage promise and married her in a faked Jewish ceremony. He then stole her savings and attempted to force her back into a brothel. Liberman escaped a second time and on 31 December 1929 she denounced the Zwi Migdal to Inspector of Police Julio Alsogaray. Her judicial complaint was the first to publicly expose these criminal networks in Argentina and evolved into the dissolution of the human trafficking network.  Complaint and Zwi Migdal persecution  After Liberman escaped the second time, she contacted Julio Alsogaray, a policeman with a reputation for integrity, and with him on 31 December 1929 filed a complaint in court. The commissary asked if she was determined to make her declaration to the magistrate and she affirmed: \\"I can only die once, I won't withdraw the complaint\\". The criminal court magistrate Manuel Rodr√≠guez Ocampo called Liberman to testify. Her testimony brought to light the criminal organization's methods, where women were forcibly transported from one place to another, and constantly abused physically and psychologically to make them subservient and prevent them from denouncing the organization. The magistrate ordered the detention of 108 members of the Zwi Migdal and the arrest of 334 fugitives on charges of corruption and conspiracy. The lengthy trial ended in September 1930, with 108 criminal convictions. \\"The very existence of the Zwi Migdal Organization directly threatens our society\\", Judge Ocampo wrote in his verdict, handing down long prison sentences. During the investigation the complicity of the criminal organization with the federal police was uncovered. The magistrate's ruling was appealed. Despite Liberman's testimony, the appeals chamber magistrate only retained three members of the organization in custody, freeing the other members. The appeals chamber magistrate justified this action by saying that only Liberman had testified (despite constant threats) whereas other victims did not. However, the trial increased public awareness of Zwi Migdal, and led to its dissolution. Death In 1934 Liberman applied for a visa to return to Poland. The trip never took place since several months later, on 7 April 1935, she died of thyroid cancer at the age of 34.  Recognition  Raquel Liberman has been the inspiration for a number of authors. Nora Glickman's book The Jewish White Slave Trade and the Untold Story of Raquel Liberman is a historical account. Writer and poet Ilan Sheinfeld has also written an account of that time, The Tale of a Ring. Humberto Costantini died before he could complete a fictionalized account, Rapsod√≠a de Raquel Liberman, which he had hoped would \\"justify [him] in the eyes of God\\". Carlos Luis Serrano wrote a play about her, Raquel Liberman: una historia de Pichincha. The novel THE THIRD DAUGHTER (HarperCollins, 2019) by Talia Carner is a penetrating look into early 20th-century sex-trafficking taking the cue from Sholem Aleichem's \\"The Man from Buenos Aires.\\" Myrtha Shalom wrote the book La Polaca. Argentine-born film-maker Gabriela Bohm has produced a 30-minute documentary about her, entitled Raquel: a marked woman. In Argentina, as of June 2010, the Raquel Liberman award was created to honor those who promote and protect the rights of survivors of violence against women.

She attended the Bournemouth School of Art and later studied engraving and illustration at the Royal College of Art. Belsky won a cartoon competition for Punch in the 1930s. It was at the Royal College of Art that she met her future husband, Czech exile and sculptor, Franta Belsky. Franta introduced her work to editors he knew at the magazine Lilliput, where Belsky became a regular contributor. In 1944, Margaret and Franta married, with Belsky taking on her husband's name for her single word signature, disguising her gender. Belsky started working for the Daily Herald in 1951 and became their first ever pocket cartoonist, at the same time becoming the first woman to draw a daily front-page cartoon. Belsky was dismissive of her own work, calling herself \\"just a hack.\\" She didn't collect her work, though it was estimated that she may have drawn more than 6,000 cartoons while working for the Daily Herald. When the Daily Herald, later The Sun, was taken over by Rupert Murdoch in 1969, Belsky refused to work for him. Instead she contributed cartoons for many other newspapers and magazines, including The Strand Magazine, Punch, The Guardian, John Bull, Men Only, the New Statesman, Sunday People, the Financial Weekly, and Sunday Graphic.

One of the narratives is how past governments, including Russia and the West, with their continued, largely failing, interventions in Afghanistan, keep repeating such failures, without properly understanding the country's cultural background or its past political history and societal structure. It also outlines the US's alliance with Saudi Arabia, especially the former's agreement to buy Saudi oil, for control of a key energy supplier during the cold-war era, with Saudi Arabia gaining wealth and security in return, with agreement withstanding provided it was allowed to continue its violent and fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, Wahhabism, uninhibited from external influence. This in turn has fed like a feedback loop back into the many troubles the world faces with regard to various militant Islamic forces spanning the 1970s to present day; be they the Mujahideen, Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and into IS. Curtis describes the film as an attempt to add an \\"emotional\\" dimension to the context of the historical narrative in order to draw its audience in ‚Äì hence its over two hours in length and availability exclusively through the BBC iPlayer ‚Äì in order to give the viewer something beyond the disconnected news reports they're usually fed from most traditional broadcast journalism, along with putting historical facts in a truer broader context. > BBC iPlayer has given me the opportunity to do this - because it isn‚Äôt > restrained by the rigid formats and schedules of network television. [...] I > have got hold of the unedited rushes of almost everything the BBC has ever > shot in Afghanistan. It is thousands of hours - some of it is very dull, but > large parts of it are extraordinary. Shots that record amazing moments, but > also others that are touching, funny and sometimes very odd.

And out of them I have tried to build a different and more > emotional way of depicting what really happened in Afghanistan.

Roosevelt and King Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, on a ship in the Great Bitter Lake on the Suez Canal, where much of the events to follow could be said to have originated. The film was released on Sunday 25 January 2015 exclusively on the BBC iPlayer. Reception Sam Wollaston, writing in The Guardian, described the film as \\"distinctive, genuinely different. It‚Äôs also worrying, beautiful, funny (really), ambitious, serious, gripping and very possibly important.\\" Wollaston commended Curtis for \\"at least taking a step back, to look at the modern world, then take it on,\\" but admitted that the film was not completely successful in explaining the situation, leaving him with \\"confusion and uncertainty aplenty.\\" While occasionally \\"infuriated\\" by Curtis's style - \\"all the wobbliness ‚Äì at times I felt I was actually on a camel. And the sudden zooming in to people‚Äôs eyes, am I now riding a high-velocity high-explosive US bullet?\\" - Wollaston concluded that the film was \\"beautiful\\" and \\"television like no one else does\\". Emma Graham-Harrison, also writing in The Guardian, noted that Curtis had done \\"a powerful job of conveying the sheer physical incongruity of Nato's heavy military presence in impoverished Afghanistan\\", and had captured \\"the strangeness of these heavily armoured soldiers wandering through superficially tranquil villages and pomegranate orchards, hunting an invisible enemy, and with it a deeper truth about how mismatched the soldiers were to their mission.\\" While critical of some aspects of the film, particularly \\"of doing what he criticises politicians for: creating oversimplified stories to make sense of a complex world, and losing sight of the truth in the process\\", she felt that Curtis had managed to convey \\"the west‚Äôs terrible arrogance, the casual projection of foreign dreams and ideals on to a distant country and the readiness to walk away when it all starts going wrong\\". Jasper Rees, for The Daily Telegraph, called the film \\"visually astonishing\\" and \\"an all-you-can-eat feast of impressionistic subtlety\\". Beyond the \\"extraordinary visuals\\", \\"the hypnotic jumble of footage\\", and the \\"insistent soundtrack pump[ing] out a manipulative pulse of music from East and West, telling you what to feel\\", Rees was less convinced by the film's narrative, describing it as \\"like being hectored by a dazzling know-all with x-ray vision who espies connections across the map of history.\\" Rees was critical of the absence of fact-checking, and of the \\"only significant interview, with a Helmand veteran whose task is simply to repeat everything Curtis has already claimed. Mainly we are just invited to take his word for it\\". He concluded that \\"the egotism and grandiloquence are maddeningly at odds with the sustained brilliance of the spectacle\\", and \\"In the end, Adam Curtis sounds like just another prophet asking us to have faith in his vision. Which is an irony.\\" Jon Boone, the Pakistan correspondent for The Guardian, was less impressed by the film in his review for The Spectator, calling it \\"as simplistic as anything told by 'those in power', [and] made to seem frightfully clever by his acid-trip filmmaking style, perfectly spoofed by Ben Woodham as the 'televisual equivalent of a drunken late night Wikipedia binge with pretension for narrative coherence'\\". He was critical of the film's omission of Pakistan's role in the conflict - \\"the TV equivalent of staging Hamlet without the prince\\" - and Curtis's failure to tackle the real complexity of the situation, writing \\"it's pretty clear Curtis is as uninterested in such 'complexity' as he is in Afghans, a people he really doesn't seem to like very much. His most insidious story is that they are irredeemable savages who will always reject, steal or subvert the help of the most well-meaning of outsiders.\\" While also pointing to some of its limitations in his review for the online magazine Spiked, the academic, Bill Durodie, suggested the abiding image of the film to be \\"that of an English art teacher enthusiastically extolling the meaning of Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs conceptual artwork, Fountain, an inverted male urinal, to a group of recently liberated and incredulous Afghan women\\", before concluding his piece with the phrase \\"The horror! The horror!\\" taken from Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Overall, his view is that any perceived lack of meaning in Adam Curtis's montage was more than matched by the absence of purpose to the War in Afghanistan.Searching for Meaning in the Afghan Abyss Music Music used at any stage or repeatedly, includes: *Burial ‚Äì \\"In McDonalds\\", \\"Dog Shelter\\", and \\"Come Down To Us\\" (including closing credits) *Cliff Martinez OST to film Drive (2011), including tracks \\"My Name On A Car\\", \\"Kick Your Teeth\\", and \\"I Drive\\" *Kanye West sample from track \\"Runaway\\" *This Mortal Coil sample from track \\"The Lacemaker\\" *Nine Inch Nails ‚Äì \\"A Warm Place\\", and \\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\" *Ahmad Zahir ‚Äì \\"Aye Nam Ghumat Taranae Man\\" *Charles Ives - \\"The Unanswered Question\\" *Messiaen ‚Äì Turangal√Æla-Symphonie *Christian Zan√©si ‚Äì \\"Marseille 2\\" *David Bowie ‚Äì \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\", and \\"Warszawa\\" *Pye Corner Audio ‚Äì \\"Electronic Rhythm Number 3\\" *Gavin Miller ‚Äì \\"Ichor\\" *The House In The Woods ‚Äì \\"Sunlight On Rusting Hulk\\" *some playful ballet music, with a version of \\"Kingdom Of Shades\\" from ballet La Bayad√®re External clips Clips from various films and television programmes are used to illustrate the documentary, especially from Carry On...

He was a professor of Old Testament at Nanjing Theological Seminary during the Japanese invasion in 1937. Sone was among the small group of foreigners who remained in the city and provided aid to the Chinese victims of the Japanese atrocities. He served with John Rabe on the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone and was Associate Food Commissioner. On 18 February 1938 the name of the committee was changed to the \\"Nanjing International Relief Committee.\\" After the departure of George Fitch, Sone was elected Director of the Nanjing International Relief Committee. For their actions in support of the Chinese people, Sone and thirteen other Americans were awarded \\"The Order of the Blue Jade\\" by the Chinese government.  Early life and call to ministry  Hubert Lafayette Sone was born in Denton, Texas, in the United States, on 7 June 1892, to J. William and Martha Anne Ballew Sone. Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas, Texas, was founded in 1911, however the first class was delayed until 1915 due to construction. Sone was among the seven hundred students admitted to the inaugural class and received a Bachelor of Arts from SMU in 1916. After serving in the U.S. Army, Sone was licensed to preach by the Methodist Episcopal Church South District Conference on 7 May 1918. With the support of Highland Park Methodist Church in Dallas, Texas, known today as Highland Park United Methodist Church, Sone applied to the Board of Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, for an assignment as a missionary to China. He married Katie Helen Jackson in Chillicothe, Texas on 15 June 1918.  Leaving the United States for China  Hubert and Helen Sone The Sones departed the United States in April 1920 for the mission field in China. They arrived in Shanghai to begin their new life of ministry and teaching in China in May 1920. The Methodist Episcopal Church South mission in China was opened in Shanghai by C. Taylor, M.D. and J. Jenkins, D.D. in 1848 and 1849 respectively. They were followed by six others until 1860. Because of the Civil War in America no missionaries came to China until 1875. The missionary work was \\"evangelistic, educational, medical, literary, woman's work, etc.\\"A Century of Protestant Missions in China (1807‚Äì1907) Edited by Donald MacGillivray, Printed at the American Presbyterian Mission Press, Shanghai, 1907 p.411 As of 1906 there were sixty missionaries in the field, including wives of missionaries and the representatives of the Woman's Board. The field of endeavor included the southern end of Kiangsu and the northern end of Chekiang Provinces, one of the most densely populated regions in China.  Studying the Chinese language and missionary work  Sone's first assignment was Chinese language study at Soochow University, Suzhou China. In addition to his language studies, Rev. Sone was assigned to Huzchou to build a Methodist Mission station. Language studies were interrupted in 1921 when Hubert Sone traveled to Tehchow in northern China to do famine relief work, driving a rice truck from village to village. The Sones embarked on their first trip back to the United States on 24 June 1925, sailing from Shanghai via Hawaii to San Francisco. During this time, Hubert Sone received a Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) and a Master of Arts degree (M.A.) in 1926 and in 1927 both from Southern Methodist University. In 1928, Sone was made Superintendent of the Institutional Church in Huzchou. On 27 April 1933, Bishop Paul B. Kern appointed Sone to the faculty of the Nanking Theological Seminary, today known as the Nanjing Union Theological Seminary upon his return to China. In the summer of 1934 the Sones returned to Huzhou, China.  Missionary work in China ‚Äì Nanjing  After leaving Huzhou and moving to Nanjing, Sone taught four courses at the seminary; one in Chinese(Mandarin); two in English, and one in Hebrew. During this time, Helen Sone taught first and second grade in the Nanjing American School.  The Imperial Japanese Army reign of terror  Nanjing Datusha Âçó‰∫¨Â§ßÂ±†ÊÆ∫ 13 December 1937 ‚Äì 18 February 1938''' The Second Sino- Japanese War began in July 1937 after several incidents in northern China. Air raids by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) began in Nanjing on 15 August 1937, and school started at Nanjing Theological Seminary on 30 September 1937. Much like Londoners during the blitz by the Germans that began on Sept. 7, 1940, the residents, students and faculty of Nanjing Theological Seminary repaired to the shelters when the air raid warnings sounded. The Imperial Japanese Army captured the port city of Shanghai in November 1937, and the Chinese and foreign residents of Nanjing braced themselves for the coming invasion. Meanwhile, in November 1937, Sone sent his wife and children to Moganshan, providing them relative safety, while he remained in Nanjing. The family arrived at the base of the mountain and took a rickshaw up to Moganshan. In spite of Chinese and foreign news accounts of the destruction of Suzhou, (which lay on the IJA path between Shanghai and Nanjing) no one was ready for the scope of brutality by the IJA that followed. Some historical accounts indicate Suzhou was reduced in population from 350,000 to 500. Part of this could be attributed to Chinese fleeing the city, but the exact number of Chinese casualties may never be known. On Sunday, 28 November 1937, uncertainty hung over the city of Nanjing. Some felt the Japanese would arrive in days, some thought it would be weeks. Prudent steps were taken to preserve order; some of the city gates were closed to keep out Chinese soldiers and the wounded were no longer being brought into the city. A meeting was called at the U.S. Embassy which Sone attended:Terror in Minnie Vautrin's Nanjing- Dairies and Correspondence, 1937-38-Minnie Vautrin Edited and with an Introduction by Suping Lu, University of Illinois Press, Urbana and Chicago, 2008.p.55 > At 10 A.M was at a conference over at Embassy.

On 9 December 1937, Japanese troops launched the attack upon the city of Nanjing. For safety, a group of missionaries, including Sone, left their homes and moved into the Pearl Buck home. The was escorting U.S. residents out of the city when it was sunk by the Japanese on 12 December. The Sone family assumed Hubert Sone was on that ship evacuating with the other Americans. However, Sone had decided to stay in Nanjing and was one of the fourteen Americans who remained in Nanjing and witnessed the events of the monstrous horror.They Were in Nanjing-The Nanjing Massacre Witnessed by American and British Nationals, by Suping Lu, Hong Kong University Press, 2004 p. 14-15. By 13 December 1937 the Japanese troops entered the city and began what is known as the Nanking Massacre or the Rape of Nanking. Historians generally agree that as many as 300,000 civilian Chinese were shot, bayoneted, and burned. As many as 20,000 innocent women, young and old, even children, were raped, and mutilated.Paragraph 2, p. 1012, Judgment International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Sone was one of twenty-seven Western nationals in Nanjing who experienced its fall and witnessed the ensuing massacre. In a letter to Professor P.F. Price, Sone described what was happening in Nanjing:They Were in Nanjing-The Nanjing Massacre Witnessed by American and British Nationals, by Suping Lu, Hong Kong University Press, 2004 p. 185; H.L.

Physical violence against foreigners was also not uncommon. On 23 December, around 5 p.m., two Japanese soldiers approached a residence belonging to the Nanjing Theological Seminary, an American institution. As they began to occupy the property by force the soldiers struck and manhandled Hubert Sone, who was a member of the faculty and Chair of the Property Committee of the seminary. Sone reported this incident to the Japanese Embassy:Hubert L.

Establishment of the Nanjing Safety Zone  A \\"safety zone\\" had been implemented in Shanghai by a French, Catholic Priest, Father Robert Jacquinot de Besange, in August 1937. It was a successful model and the Nanking Safety Zone (Âçó‰∫¨ÂÆâÂÖ®Âå∫) began organizational efforts in November 1937.The Nanking Atrocities; Nankingatrocities.net On 22 November 1937, trusting their privileged status as third-party nationals, those remaining foreigners voluntarily organized a committee called the \\"International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone\\" to provide Chinese people with refuge and relief. They elected a German businessman of Siemens China Corporation, John Rabe, as its chair presumably for not only his character, but also his status as a Nazi. Japan and Germany had signed the bilateral Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936.Timothy Brook, \\"Introduction: Documenting the Rape of Nanking,\\" in Documents on the Rape of Nanking, The Nanjing Safety Zone was established in the western district of the city. It was composed of a score of refugee camps that occupied an area of about 3.4 square miles (8.6 square kilometers). On 1 December 1937, Mayor Ma Chaochun of Nanjing met the International Committee and authorized them to take over the city administration once he and his staff were evacuated. Unlike Shanghai, the Japanese never gave assurance that the Nanjing Safety Zone would not either be attacked. In spite of this the International Committee issued \\"an open letter to the residents of Nanjing on Dec. 8, 1937.\\" Residents of Nanjing began streaming into the safety zone and ultimately \\"over ninety percent of the city's population crowded into it.\\" Sone was Chairman of the Property Committee of the Nanjing Theological Seminary. He also was Associate Food Commissioner of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone. He delivered rice to the refugee camps, driving the rice truck personally. To a missionary colleague Sone wrote of the looting, rape, murder, burning and destruction caused by the Japanese.Timothy Brook, \\"Introduction: Documenting the Rape of Nanking,\\" in Documents on the Rape of Nanking,-p.56 also Hubert L.

He filed protest letters with the Japanese embassy in Nanjing, the United States Embassy and tried to alert the outside world through correspondence with colleagues in the United States. On 18 February the official name of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone was changed to the \\"Nanjing International Relief Committee.\\"They Were in Nanjing-The Nanjing Massacre Witnessed by American and British Nationals, by Suping Lu, Hong Kong University Press, 2004 p.57, 154 After George Fitch departed, Sone was elected Administrative Director of the Nanjing International Relief Committee.Timothy Brook, \\"Introduction: Documenting the Rape of Nanking,\\" in Documents on the Rape of Nanking,-p.87 also Hubert L.

During the attack on Nanjing, Sone's family, Helen, and the two children remained on Moganshan.  Order of the Blue Jade  In 1939 the Chinese government awarded Sone and thirteen other Americans, one of China's highest civilian awards for valor, the \\"Order of the Blue Jade\\" for their humanitarian efforts. Sometimes referred to as the Star of the Jade Order, or Emblem of the Blue Jade, this beautiful gold and dark and light blue jade medallion was designed like a traditional military medal; to be draped over the neck hanging over the chest by a red, white, and blue silk ribbon. Sone's award came in a black lacquer box with red silk lining inside. The box was personalized with the Chinese character for Sung (Sone). The box also contained the Chinese characters for Silk Neck Piece, Beautiful Jade, Meritorious Official Decoration with the number 131 on the back of the box. Much as decorated military veterans dismiss their awards for valor, Sone never discussed the award with his family in the years after the event. New medal scan; HLS Before Sone left China in 1951, he disposed of the award in Nanjing. In a letter to his parents he described the medal and alluded that he discarded it to avoid any further difficulty leaving China. However, he drew a picture of the medal, the lapel pin, and box in which it was presented and mailed this in a letter to his parents in the United States.  Return to Nanjing and relief work  The years 1938 through 1941 represented a return to teaching and also the work of the Nanjing International Relief Committee, of which Sone was now the director. Sone continued his work in Nanjing with the Nanking International Relief Committee, formerly the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone. It is estimated that the committee served \\"about 11,000 families.\\"  Return to the United States and WW II  Sone family, On 3 May 1941, Sone sailed on the \\"President Pierce\\" steamer for a furlough in the United States, arriving on 21 May 1941. The Sone family settled in Chicago where Hubert Sone enrolled in a doctoral program at The University of Chicago. For the United States, World War II began 7 December 1941 which indefinitely postponed returning to China.  Return to China ‚Äì Nanjing  In 1946, after World War II had ended, the Sones returned to their old home at 89 Mo Tsou Road in Nanjing. They resumed the duties of teaching, relief work, preaching in the churches, and music lessons taught by Helen Sone. Hubert Sone led an effort in 1948 to feed 15,000 refugees in Nanjing.  Leaving China for the last time  On 1 October 1949, Mao Zedong declared the advent of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The United States then suspended diplomatic ties, for decades. In 1950, the United States recalled its ambassador and urged United States citizens to leave China. On 25 June 1950, the struggle between North and South Korea became an international conflict with the adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 83 and the entry of the United States into the Korean War. On 2 December 1950, Sone requested an exit visa from the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Chinese government required departing foreigners to advertise in the paper for three days in the event there was an outstanding issue someone wished to bring. While others were granted visas, the Sone's visa was delayed and he was informed that his request was sent to Beijing for consideration. Finally in April, 1951 the Sones were allowed to leave after much of their personal effects were confiscated, such as Helen's One Thousand Flowers pattern dishes, all United States currency, his field glasses and radio with a comment that it could be used to send signals. On 12 April the Sones arrived in Hong Kong, the last American missionaries to leave Nanjing. On their fourth furlough, they departed Hong Kong on 8 May 1951 for San Francisco on board the SS \\"President Wilson\\", never to return to China.  Trinity Theological College, Singapore, Malaya  Dr. H.L. Sone teaching a class at Trinity College, Singapore, Malaya After being in the US for a little over one year, the Sones left New York City by boat in 1952 for a new assignment, Trinity College, today known as Trinity Theological College, in Singapore, Malaya. Here the Sones would make their home for the next nine years. Today the institution is known as Trinity Theological College (TTC). It \\"serves all Christian churches and denominations by educating and equipping Christian leaders for the manifold ministries of the church across Asia.\\"http://www.ttc.edu.sg During his tenure in Singapore at Trinity College, Sone served as a faculty member, Dean, then Principal of Trinity Theological College. He also preached at local churches, and served as Secretary of the Trustees of the Methodist Church in Malaysia.  Retirement, death and legacy  Hubert & Helen at Trinity(Helen seated at home) In 1961, the Sones return to the United States and retired from active mission work after forty one years of service. For the next nine years Sone preached at area churches and travelled widely, lecturing on the work of the Methodist Church in Asia. Hubert Sone's everlasting legacy is the inspiring humanitarian work done to assist the Chinese during the events in Nanjing from 1937‚Äì1938. Hubert and Helen Sone dedicated their own lives, not only to the church and the Methodist mission in China, but to the Chinese people and to Malaysians in Singapore. Hubert and Helen Sone's support of the Chinese people at personal risk, and their dedication to the calling of being missionaries, will forever enshrine their love of the Chinese people and their Christian faith. Hubert L. Sone died in Fort Worth, Texas, USA on 6 September 1970 at age 78. On 18 October 1982, Helen Jackson Sone died in Fort Worth, Texas, USA at the age of 89.

Vertigo ultimathule is a medium-sized Vertigo, which reaches a height of 2.1‚Äì2.2 mm and a diameter of 1.3‚Äì1.4 mm, the number of whorls is 4.6‚Äì4.7. The shell is almost cylindrical, with marked convex whorls, which are separated by a marked, deep suture. The shape is not distinctly ovoid, as in some other Vertigo-species, and the last whorl does not narrow markedly at the base. In side view from left the outer margin of the last whorl forms a blunt angle close to the umbilicus. The aperture is completely toothless or with only a small, delicate, rather deeply set parietal denticle. The mouth-edge is simple and scarcely thickened. The colour of the shell is light yellow ‚Äì dark yellow-brown. The surface is glossy, with marked, but irregular, rather coarse striation. { Apical view. Umbilical view. } { Lateral view.

Early life Hefty was born Heinrich Hefti in 1858 at Schwanden, in the Swiss canton of Glarus. His father was an architect and building contractor who taught his son the principles of architecture and construction. Hefty continued his study of architecture at the Darmstadt Technical School, graduating in 1879. He immigrated to the United States in 1881, following his brother to Portland. He later adopted the anglicised spelling of his name. Career Hefty began working in Portland as a building contractor, and he employed over twenty workers. Beginning in 1884 he focused entirely on architecture, designing in a variety of styles and usually incorporating at least one tower in his designs. Most of Hefty's work is preserved only in photographs and engravings, although a few buildings remain. He designed Portland's First Congregational Church at SW Park and Madison Street, and he supervised its construction between 1889 and 1895. In 1904 Hefty designed the Eaton Hotel at SW 9th and Morrison. One of his last projects was the Buckingham Hotel in 1911, also known as the Kingston Apartments, at the intersection of West Burnside, Southwest Morrison, and Southwest 20th Place. =City Hall= One of Hefty's designs that was never completed was Portland City Hall. In 1890 Hefty won a design competition to build a new city hall. His design was massive, and its construction required a major amount of stone, iron, and brick over a two-year period at a cost of $500,000. Hefty's compensation for the project as approved by the city was $20,000. After the building's foundation was completed, the city council stopped construction, citing cost overruns. The council awarded a new contract to architects Whidden & Lewis to design a less costly, more modest building.The council may have had undisclosed motives for firing Hefty and awarding a new contract to Whidden and Lewis. The amount of capital raised from the sale of city construction bonds plus accrued interest was almost $550,000. It may have seemed wise at the time to build a cheaper city hall and use the excess cash for other projects. See Biographer H.K. Hines classified the change of architects as \\"political dodgery.\\" In 1915 Hefty died suddenly during a vacation in Switzerland. At the time, his estate was valued at $70,000.

The film also marks the debut of Krazy's second theme song which would have a much longer run than his first. Plot At a harbor, a paddle steamer carrying popular stage performers arrives. One of the performers is a girl cockapoo whom Krazy suddenly falls in love with. Krazy goes on to serenade her with a banjo. Momentarily a hippo, who's also in love with her, also comes by. A show opens at a theater, and starts with an orchestra playing \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\\". The second act features a pack of hens doing can can, and twirling muskets. Most of the spectators watch from the stands. Krazy, for some reason, watches from a balcony that's meant for special guests. The hippo too watches from a balcony which is on the other side of the stands. The third and final act features the girl cockapoo. She sings a non-verbal song but her gestures suggest she desperately wants someone to love her. From their balconies, Krazy and the hippo express their submission in body language. The two guys continue until they drop onto the stage. When the song ends, it appears the girl cockapoo belongs to a boy hedgehog who escorts her out of the stage, much to the surprise of Krazy and the hippo. They are even further surprised when the audience gazes at them before laughing. The hippo tries to entertain the crowd by doing a little ballet. Krazy does not want him to have the spotlight as the cat plucks the buttons from the hippo's trousers. The trousers come down, and the hippo leaves in a blush. Krazy takes over the limelight in doing some tap dancing. The hippo decides to get back at Krazy by hurling a banana peel onto the stage. Krazy manages to stay of foot for several seconds but still ends up lying flat. As a double whammy for the cat, Krazy gets pelted with objects from the spectators.

The festival's main organizer is the Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic ‚Äì European Art Centre. Its first edition happened in 2012.  Idea  Halfway Festival is a gathering involving songwriters, folk, and alternative musicians. \\"It's not the biggest, or the most important, or the best festival in the world, but it provides an indescribable and unique atmosphere for its enthusiastic audience. The festival is one of a kind, as it is created by both performers and the audience ‚Äì according to its motto: ‚ÄúClose to people, close to music‚Äù.

It's all based on trust and a big culture of participants. There's time to talk to artists, to see them walking around, resting or listening to other performers amongst the audience. It's the festival where nobody should hurry; the artists can play for as long as they and their fans want, as there's no time limit for the performances. It's the festival which connects the music tradition of Western and Eastern Europe, and the US in one place.  Place  Halfway is a cameral festival which takes place in an amphitheatre with great, unique acoustics. The scenery sits really close, within the audience's reach. The amphitheatre is located at Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic ‚Äì European Art Centre in Bia≈Çystok ‚Äì the largest institute of arts in Northeastern Poland, and the most modern cultural center in this region of Europe.

The milk comes in four varieties: reduced fat, chocolate, fat-free, and whole milk. Until December 2019, The Coca-Cola Co owned a 42.5% stake in Fa!rlife LLC. On January 3, 2020 The Coca-Cola Co announced that it acquired the remaining 57.5% equity stake in Fa!rlife LLC. Fairlife is one of the only brands that The Coca-Cola Company owned to not have it headquartered in Coke's main headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Instead, Fairlife's Chicago, Illinois office has been retained. Filtration process Anders Porter of Fairlife's Coopersville, Michigan, facility stated, \\"we separate the cream, filter, heat treat, homogenize, test and bottle the milk.\\" According to Sue McCloskey, who developed the system used to make Fairlife with her husband Mike McCloskey, the ultrafiltration process removes the lactose and much of the sugar and leaves behind more of the protein and calcium. Fairlife is labeled as ultra- filtered milk. Advertising and launch In 2012, fairlife, LLC was formed when Select Milk Producers entered into a partnership with The Coca-Cola Company. The brand first appeared in Minnesota, where it launched in February 2014. In November 2014, an advertising campaign for the brand featuring pin-up girls covered in milk, with the taglines on the ads claiming the milk contained \\"50% more protein & calcium,\\" was launched in the brand's Minneapolis and Denver test markets. Business Insider reported that some Twitter users criticized the advertisements. Laura Bates of The Guardian criticized the ads, claiming they sexualized women for commercial purposes and noting, \\"seeing these images of women‚Äôs bodies being used, once again, to advertise an unrelated consumer product ('Drink what she‚Äôs wearing') is a tedious reminder that when it comes to the objectification of women in advertising, we seem to be slipping backward instead of moving forward.\\" Chris Plante of The Verge commented, \\"at worst the ad is selling consumers on the idea of drinking ultra-filtered milk off an ultra-sexualized woman, and at worst it's selling you 2% part milk. The remaining Fairlife ads are equal parts awkward and demeaning.\\" Plante, however, adds,\\"otherwise Fairlife has honed its pitch as a healthy, natural dairy product,\\" mentioning the brand's marketing sheet. Later, in February 2015, the Coca-Cola Company officially launched Fairlife, and began to distribute the milk across the United States. Fairlife is marketed as an ultra-filtered milk, as well as \\"a dairy option that is sourced from sustainable family farms.\\" In November 2015, Fairlife added its fa!rlife YUP! brand to its lineup, which was marketed to \\"tweens\\" and young adults. It currently comes in four all-natural flavors, including Rich Chocolate, Smooth Vanilla, Very Strawberry and Dairy ‚ÄòLicious. It's marketed as having 25% less sugar \\"compared to regular low-fat chocolate milk\\". Distribution and pricing The Fairlife line of milk is distributed by Coca-Cola's Minute Maid division. In regard to Coca-Cola's strategy for Fairlife, the company's North America President Sandy Douglas stated, \\"Our vision for the nutrition beverage business and the milk product that I showed you which is made on a sustainable dairy with fully sustainable high-care processes with animals, has a proprietary milk filtering process that allows you to increase protein by 50 percent, take sugar down by 30 percent, and have no lactose, and a milk that's premiumised and taste better and we'll charge twice as much for it as the milk we're used to buying in a jug.\\" The cost of Fairlife is indeed, roughly twice as high as conventional milk; Fairlife's national average price in the US is $4.29 per 52 oz., compared to the national average pricing of conventional milk at $2 per 64 oz. Reception Following its widespread launch in February 2015, Khushbu Shah of Eater.com wrote that overall reviews of the milk was mixed, although that the chocolate variety, in particular, was generally well received. Dietitians and nutritionists were generally critical of the milk; Alissa Rumsey, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics expressed, \\"When you really look at the numbers, it can sound appealing, but in general most Americans are already getting enough protein,\\" adding, \\"If you need more, eat an egg or a handful of almonds. And people who need more calcium should up their intake of dark leafy greens, not the so-called Frankenmilk.\\" Registered dietitian Keri Gans claimed, \\"milk is already a great package of nutrients; I‚Äôm not quite sure why it needs to be changed,\\" and commented on the removal of sugar in Fairlife milk with, \\"I never looked at the sugar in milk as a problem.\\" Meredith Engel of New York Daily News speculated that, \\"it‚Äôs clear why Coke is trying to get into the milk business: More and more Americans are turning away from sugary soft drinks, and soda sales fell to a 19-year-low in 2013.\\" Men's Health nutrition advisor Mike Roussell, however advised his clients to switch over to Fairlife's milk. Hayley Peterson of Business Insider wrote, \\"The chocolate milk was the crowd favorite. It's very sweet, but not overpowering, and the consistency is creamier and thicker than regular milk.\\" Peterson adds that, \\"most people agreed that the 2% milk tasted similar to whole milk. Many reviewers loved the milky taste, while others thought it was too overpowering.\\" Sam Rega, a Business Insider video producer commented, \\"Both skim and 2% had an after-taste, but otherwise I couldn't tell much of a difference from this and regular milk.\\" While Chris Plante of The Verge commented, \\"to my surprise, Fairlife tastes, well, like milk. It looks and feels a little thicker than traditional milk, and has a slightly richer taste, especially the chocolate milk, which sits on the spectrum between chocolate shake and milk that's stewed on a lazy Saturday morning in a bowl of Cocoa Puffs,\\" he criticized the aftertaste, stating, \\"Fairlife's aftertaste is less appealing. A few minutes sipping a cup of chocolate Fairlife and then a cup of 2% Fairlife, the inside of my mouth had that malty feel that chases a protein shake.\\" Rachel Sanders of Buzzfeed observed, \\"Fairlife is a little bit creepy to drink. The texture is much more viscous and thick than regular milk, and the odor is really strong, to the point that it smells almost spoiled. It tastes OK, but has a slightly musky flavor that reminds me of shelf-stable or reconstituted milk.\\" Controversy On June 4, 2019, the animal protection organization Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) released a video of an undercover dairy investigation into Fair Oaks Farms in Fair Oaks, Indiana. During the investigation, farm employees were observed slapping, kicking, punching, pushing, throwing and slamming calves; calves were stabbed and beaten with steel rebars, hit in the mouth and face with hard plastic milking bottles, kneed in the spine, burned in the face with hot branding irons. This resulted in extreme pain and suffering by the calves, and in some cases permanent injury and even death. ARM confirmed that male calves from Fair Oaks Farms are in fact transported to veal farms (Midwest Veal and Calf Start), despite the corporation's claims that it does not send its male calves to veal farms. In addition, the ARM investigator captured footage of drug use. The four Fair Oaks Farms employees including the ARM employee were fired a few months before the video was released and at least three retailers including Jewel-Osco announced they would remove all Fairlife products from their shelves. Indiana state Senator Travis Holdman, who sponsored Indiana's ag-gag bill, claimed that the video was \\"politically motivated\\", which ARM vigorously denied and prompted the group to release extended footage. The political controversy deepened as Newton County Prosecutor Jeff Drinski released a statement indicating that the ARM investigator encouraged or coerced the farm employees to abuse the animals. ARM's founder, Richard Couto, rebuked the statement and said that his organization has not been contacted by the prosecutors office, which he says is a red flag given ARM has worked with law enforcement agencies in other abuse investigations. \\"There is no reason the prosecutor shouldn‚Äôt be calling me and/or a witness to be interviewed yet,\\" he said. A binder detailing ARM's investigation along with video footage were provided to the Newton County Sheriff's Office the same day the video was released to the public.

It is held in a private collection. The enigmatic title of the work, as with the majority of Magritte‚Äôs, was suggested by one of his friends ‚Äì the Surrealist poet Paul Noug√©. In 1943 Noug√© produced a monograph on Magritte in which he wrote about the present painting: ‚ÄòOne muses over the identical objects, over the possible repetition of the more unusual of them, over the way things have of filling the expanse and the sudden apparition of the terrifying masks of ‚Äúthe end of contemplation‚Äù and the women‚Äôs bodies closely entwined, which represents ‚Äúthe adulation of space‚Äù‚Äô.David Sylvester (ed.) & Sarah Whitfield, op. cit., p. 256. Magritte‚Äôs idiosyncratic form of Surrealism emerged in the middle of the 1920s, following a short flirtation with Cubist and Futurist art. The Surrealist techniques and mechanisms espoused by Andr√© Breton and his followers were primarily concerned with elucidating dream-like imagery and manifesting the sub-conscious. Magritte's approach eschewed these notions; his art would be wholly rational, and informed by ‚Äòlines of research‚Äô, which Paul Noug√© categorised as ‚Äòisolation of an object by the frame or some other means; more or less apparent distortion; modification of the substance of the object; change of scale; change of d√©cor‚Äô.\\"Magritte (exhibition catalogue)\\". The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal, 1996, p. 18. In The Adulation of Space Magritte has introduced several of these types of manipulation. The repoussoir effect of the amorphic grey structure surrounding the figures frames the truncated forms and obscures the viewer‚Äôs perception of scale. Other works from the late 1920s such as La D√©mon de la perversit√© and D√©couverte similarly pervert the natural scale and appearance of objects, whilst retaining an incontrovertible sense of rationality which is preserved by Magritte‚Äôs trompe l‚Äô≈ìil technique.Surrealist Art Evening Sale Sotheby's London. Retrieved 3 February 2015. In 1920 Magritte was introduced to Edouard L√©on Th√©odore Mesens by their mutual acquaintance Karel Maes at the first exhibition of the artist‚Äôs Cubo-Futurist work organised by the Centre d‚ÄôArt in Brussels. Mesens was a man of numerous talents and occupations ‚Äì a musician, poet, critic and gallerist ‚Äì who was to become Magritte‚Äôs most vociferous supporter and promoter. In the mid-1920s Mesens and Magritte published the short-lived reviews ≈ísophage and Marie and contributed to the last edition of Francis Picabia‚Äôs Dadaist revue 391. Having partly abandoned his musical career Mesens set about selling and promoting avant-garde art, first at the Galerie Manteau, and later at Paul-Gustave van Hecke‚Äôs Galerie L‚ÄôEpoque in Brussels. Mesens and Van Hecke became the principal dealers in Magritte‚Äôs work, and as such they sold The Adulation of Space to the fated Galerie Le Centaure in 1929. Soon after the sale the Galerie Le Centaure was forced to close and the stock liquidated and Mesens was able to buy a number of paintings, including the present work. In 1938 Mesens left Belgium and opened The London Gallery (backed by Roland Penrose), with a debut solo exhibition of Magritte‚Äôs greatest and latest works. Although the gallery closed in 1950, Mesens continued to champion his friend‚Äôs work and retained a large collection of his most important paintings for his own pleasure. The Adulation of Space has remained with his family until the present day.

It was designed by Whinney, Son & Austen Hall as an office building for Cr√©dit Lyonnais and built between 1974 and 1977. It became a Grade II listed building in 2015. The location was formerly the site of the city church of St Mildred, Bread Street, designed by Christopher Wren after the medieval church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London; the Wren church was bombed and destroyed in the Second World War. The site was one of the last bomb sites in London to be redeveloped. The building has six storeys with a raised basement. Its height was limited due to its proximity to St Paul's Cathedral to the north-west, and the high water table prevented a sub-basement. Its shape was constrained by its triangular island site, east of Bread Street, west of the junction where Cannon Street crosses Queen Victoria Street. It originally had an entrance on each fa√ßade (the western one on Bread Street has been removed) and a large central circular banking hall (also now removed). Although built for Cr√©dit Lyonnais, it was designed so it could occupied by three separate banks, one in each corner of the building, but the interior has been significantly altered. The fa√ßades are characterised by tiers of repeating arched white frames around recessed windows of bronze-tinted glass, with each tier separated by a black granite string course which incorporates hidden drainage. The cladding units are pre-cast double-skinned wide modules of glass fibre reinforced cement (GRC), using a mixture of Portland cement with 5% alkali-resistant glass fibre as reinforcement. It was the first building in the world to be entirely clad with GRC panels. Triple-width modules on the ground floor wide have two canted windowpanes meeting at an angle, with similar modules repeated on upper floors to either side of the entrances. The slim profile and light weight of the GRC panels allowed the architect to slope the walls outward at an angle of five degrees, with each floor slightly larger than the one below, creating extra square metres of office space. The units of the partial upper floor are inverted, creating a roof line that resembles a crown to the north side and at the eastern end; a roof deck occupies at the south-western corner. Railings on the street have shapes similar to the cladding panels.

The main focus of Brash Books is to republish award-winning and critically acclaimed novels, primarily from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, which had fallen out of print. The imprint also publishes new crime fiction and suspense novels. The imprint launched in September 2014 with 29 reprints, including the Nero Award-winning Sleeping Dog by Dick Lochte, Edgar Award finalist Lover Man by Dallas Murphy, and the new novel Treasure Coast by Tom Kakonis. The company has since published other books, such as Mark Smith's Death of the Detective, a National Book Award finalist,Lareviewofbooks.org Barbara Neely's Blanche on the Lam, (recipient of the Agatha and Anthony Award), Max Allan Collins' novel Road to Perdition in a new, expanded edition (incorporating material from his original graphic novel, elements from his novelization of the feature screenplay, and new material),Themysterplace.com and Carolyn Weston's Poor, Poor Ophelia, which inspired the television series The Streets of San Francisco. Brash has published 100 novels as of mid-2019.http://www.brash-books.com Brash's titles are available as paperbacks through the Ingram Content Group and Baker & Taylor. Goldberg and Goldman, longtime friends, hatched the idea for Brash Books after a discussion at the 2013 Bouchercon convention in Albany, New York. When Goldberg mentioned to Goldman that he wanted to find a way to republish some of his favorite out-of- print titles, Goldman, a former lawyer, offered to help him create the business. The company's name was inspired by their slogan, \\"We publish the best crime novels in existence\\", which Goldberg describes as \\"a brash claim, but we believe our novels back it up.\\" Goldberg serves as the publisher's book scout and handles most of its social media, while Goldman deals with financial and legal matters. Other authors published by Brash include top ten New York Times bestselling authors Robin Burcell, Max Allan Collins and Phoef Sutton,Mysteryscenemag.com and Edgar Award nominees Noreen Ayers, Bill Crider, Amazon.com and Jack Lynch.Thrillingdetective.com In 2017, they launched the subsidiary Brash Audio and produced a dozen audiobooks in their first year.Brashaudio.com They also published Leo W. Banks' original novel Double Wide, which won two 2018 Spur Awards, for Best First Novel and Best Contemporary Western, from the Western Writers of America. Double Wide was also named True West's Magazine's Best Contemporary Western of the Year. In 2019, they republished the twelve Hardman crime novels by Ralph Dennis, as well as four of his long-lost, unpublished works. The Hardman books included introductions by author Joe R. Lansdale, among others. A newly discovered thirteenth Hardman novel, All Kinds of Ugly, was released in February 2020 with revisions by Goldberg. That same month, they also released a lost, previously unpublished book by Hammer Horror writer/director/producer Jimmy Sangster. The book is entitled Fireball and is the fourth book in his James Reed series (Snowball, Blackball and Hardball), that was published in the late 1980s.

A late example of modern classicism, it was constructed from 1955 to 1958 to a design by Sir Albert Richardson to serve as the headquarters and printing works of the Financial Times, on a cleared bomb site southeast of St Paul's Cathedral. It is a Grade II* listed building, and was the first building built after the Second World War in England to become listed. The Financial Times moved back into Bracken House, which was extensively refurbished in 2018-19 by John Robertson Architects, in spring 2019. Background New offices were required for the Financial Times after it merged with the Financial News in 1945. The building was named after Brendan Bracken, who became Viscount Bracken in 1952. The building was clad in pink sandstone from Hollington, Staffordshire, as an allusion to the characteristic pink colour of the newspaper, with red bricks and bronze windows, contrasting with the verdigris of the copper roof. Editorial offices were located in the northern range, beside Cannon Street, with printing machinery in an octagonal structure in the centre, and more offices to the south, by Queen Victoria Street. Above the entrance on Cannon Street is an astrological clock, designed by Frank Dobson and Philip Bentham and made by Thwaites & Reed. The clock features the face of Winston Churchill at the centre of a large gold sunburst, Churchill having been a great friend of Viscount Bracken during the war. 1980s redevelopment Like other newspapers, the Financial Times moved out of central London in the 1980s, and the printing works closed in 1988. The building was sold by Pearson in 1987. In August 1987 Bracken House became the first post-war building in England to become a listed building, to prevent it being demolished and replaced by a new glass and steel building proposed by Michael Hopkins and Partners (the post-war Brynmawr Rubber Factory was listed in 1985 by the Welsh Office). The plans were changed to incorporate the old building, redeveloped by Obayashi Corporation between 1988 and 1992. The altered building retained the old ranges to the north and south, but replaced the central printing hall with a new glass and structural gunmetal structure on a Hollington sandstone plinth, with boxy oriel windows inspired by Oriel Chambers in Liverpool (constructed in 1864). With its main entrance now at 1 Friday Street to the east, the building was altered to include large open offices and trading floors for the European head office of the Industrial Bank of Japan, which combined with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank in 2002 to form Mizuho Financial Group, the third largest bank in Japan. The Hopkins additions were included in the Grade II* listing in 2013. In 2019 the Financial Times relocated from their offices at Southwark Bridge back to Bracken House.{{cite website https://www.ft.com/content/fe383b92-6d98-11e9-9ff9-8c855179f1c4 File:Bracken House in Cannon Street - geograph.org.uk - 881698.jpgLooking east along Cannon Street File:EH1262582 Bracken House 04.jpgNorth east corner, where Friday Street meets Cannon Street File:EH1262582 Bracken House 03.jpgThe east fa√ßade on Friday Street, from the south-east, looking north-west File:EH1262582 Bracken House 01.jpgThe south fa√ßade from Queen Victoria Street File:EH1262582 Bracken House 06.jpgThe astronomical clock above the entrance File:Clock (8151686131).jpgDetail of astronomical clock References * Bracken House, National Heritage List for England, Historic England * London Remembers * London Architecture Guide * e-architect.co.uk * Original building, City of London Category:Office buildings in London Category:Grade II* listed buildings in the City of London Category:Office buildings completed in 1958 Category:Buildings by Hopkins Architects Category:Modern architecture in the United Kingdom Category:Neoclassical architecture in London Category:Astronomical clocks in the United Kingdom ","title":"Bracken House, London"},{"id":"45296329","text":"Tololo 1247-232 (Tol 1247 or T1247)) is a small galaxy at a distance of (redshift z=0.0480). It is situated in the southern equatorial constellation of Hydra. Visually, Tol 1247 appears to be an irregular or possibly a barred spiral galaxy. Tol 1247 is named after the surveys that were carried at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), the first of which was in 1976. It is one of nine galaxies in the local universe known to emit Lyman continuum photons. Background The Victor M. Blanco Telescope at CTIO Tol 1247-232 (T1247) was first described in 1985. It was observed in the infrared using the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) 4m telescope, as part of a study of regions of intense star formation. Six years later, T1247 was identified as an HII galaxy in the paper 'A spectrophotometric catalogue of HII galaxies', a study of 425 emission-line galaxies. T1247 has also been classified as a starburst galaxy, a blue compact dwarf and a Wolf-Rayet galaxy. Lyman continuum leakage T1247 is one of nine galaxies in the local universe that have been identified as leaking Lyman continuum (LyC) photons. The first published detection of Lyman continuum photons from T1247 was made in 2013 by Leitet et al. using data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). It was the second known LyC-leaking source in the local universe. HST WFC (using the UVIS channel) taken in 2013 as part of Program 13027. LyC leakage is crucial to the process known as reionization which is believed to have occurred within the first 10% of the age of the Universe. The cosmic reionization is, after recombination, the second major phase-change of hydrogen in the universe. The epoch of reionization began when the first sources appeared which produced photons capable of ionizing the surrounding medium, and ended when all of the intergalactic medium (IGM) was ionized. LyC photons are responsible for this process. However, to date it is unclear which physical mechanisms effectively produce large amounts of LyC photons, such that the reionization of the Universe could be powered. Two processes are currently discussed and under evaluation: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and starbursts in dwarf galaxies. AGNs are known to produce large amounts of LyC emission, but in the early Universe the number of AGNs is unknown, and often believed to be too small to power the reionization. On the other side, dwarf starbursts are known to be numerous in the early Universe, but their LyC emission is unknown. For that reason local galaxies such as TOL1247 are studied in detail, in order to understand physical processes that produce escaping LyC photons. In TOL1247 it was found that bulk of the LyC photons emerges from two massive stellar clusters located in the central region of the galaxy. The escape is supported by the structure of the interstellar medium of the galaxy, which appears to be clumpy and highly ionized. Although Puschnig et al. (2017) could verify that LyC indeed escapes from TOL1247, their new spectroscopic data obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope indicates a relatively low number of escaping LyC photons (only 1.5% escape fraction). Thus, if galaxies in the early Universe were similar to TOL1247, they would indeed contribute to reionization, but not sufficiently to explain the second major phase-change in the Universe.

Rabbi Mondshine authored over twenty works on Chabad Hasidic social and intellectual history, and published a number of articles in various journals, both academic and rabbinic, some of them under the pseudonym Yehoshua D. Levanon. Mondshine's work on Chabad and general Hasidic historiography continued a tradition in Chabad from the Nineteenth Century where the Chabad movement published material in the spirit of critical academic historiography. Personal life Yoshua Mondshine was born on January 30, 1947 (or 9 Shevat, 5707, in the Hebrew calendar), in the city of Tel Aviv, Israel.COLlive reporter. \\"R' Yehoshua Mondshine, 68, OBM.\\" COLlive.com, December 24, 2014. Mondshine studied at Yeshivas Hayishuv Hachadash in Tel Aviv and later at Central Tomchei Tmimim Yeshiva in Kfar Chabad where he studied under the Mashpia Rabbi Shlomo Chaim Kesselman. In 1968, Mondshine studied at the Central Lubavitch Yeshiva in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. As a student in Crown Heights, Mondshine worked as a lead editor assisting Rabbi Yehoshua Korf publish a new commentary to the Tanya, the classical work of Chabad philosophy. In 1968, Mondshine married Rochel Leah Braufman (Braverman), daughter of Rabbi Dovid Braverman who headed the Kehot publishing group in Europe and the Kfar Chabad Council, and had five children. After the death of his wife Rochel in 2006, Mondshine married Devorah Kwin- Althaus. Mondshine's son Rabbi Dovid Mondshine is the director of the Ohr Avner Foundation. =Correspondence with the Lubavitcher Rebbe= In around 1960, Yehoshua Mondshine began corresponding with the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, when he requested and received a blessing ahead of his Bar Mitzvah. Mondshine continued to write to the Rebbe, confiding his teenage anxieties and seeking spiritual advice; Mondshine, in one early letter, included a list of textual variants he had noticed in the Chabad prayerbook compared to earlier sources. The Rebbe referred him to a number of sources where he could explore the issues and discover an answer for himself. Career Though he received an offer from the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, to run the Chabad Library, Mondshine instead took the position as a librarian at the National Library of Israel at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Rabbi Mondshine edited a number of books on the topic of Chabad history, referencing original manuscripts that he discovered, compiling evidence to differentiate between authoritative traditions and legends. As a Chabad Hasid and historian and scholar, Mondshine won the respect both of academic scholars and of members of the Chabad community. Mondshine was responsible for publishing, editing, and producing a number of scholarly articles, bibliographies, and polemical essays;\\"Remembering Yehoshua Mondshine, Historian and Hasid.\\" Mosaic Magazine, December 29, 2014. his work was especially well received by the Lubavitcher Rebbe who encouraged his literary work. Israeli historian Tom Segev called Mondshine \\"Chabad's critic from within\\" for his articles that critically examined various popular Hasidic tales. =Research on the origins on Hasidic-Mitnagdic controversy= Yehoshua Mondshine has argued against other Jewish historians, such as Simon Dubnow, Mordechai Vilensky and Immanuel Etkes, that Rabbi Elijah of Vilna (the Vilna Goan) was not the driving force behind the early persecution of Hasidim, and had only become involved due to the activism of leaders of the Kahal (the autonomous administrative body) of the Jewish community of Vilna. The Kahal leaders viewed Hasidism as a movement that threatened the social order and their economic and social standing; the leaders presented the Vilna Gaon with false evidence, thus inciting him to lash out at the Hasidim. Mondshine uses Russian archival documents to back his theory of the events.Assaf, David. \\"Remembering the life and teachings of Chabad founder, 200 years after his death.\\" Ha'aretz, September 26, 2013.

Dark spots are places where frost has disappeared from the dark dunes. Note: this is an enlargement of the previous image of Wegener Crater. Dark spots appear on dunes in the higher latitudes of Mars. In these spots mineral grains may be covered with a thin film of water that may affect chemical weathering of minerals and may help possible Martian organisms to survive. Studies have shown that thin films of water could exist at times on the Martian surface at certain times and in certain locations. In places, thin layers of liquid water could be present for 38 sols (Martian days) in the warmer periods of the day.Zent, A.P., Haberle, R.M., Howard, C.H., Jakosky, B.M., 1993.

Sometimes geysers form near the spots. They have two main features (dark dune spots and spider channels) that appear at the beginning of the Martian spring on dune fields covered with carbon dioxide (CO2 or 'dry ice'), mainly at the ridges and slopes of the dunes; by the beginning of winter, they disappear. Dark spots' shape is generally round, on the slopes it is usually elongated. With the stronger sunshine of spring in certain regions, carbon dioxide gas jets shoot dark dust in the air. This dark dust will increase the absorption of light and cause the temperature to rise to where water can exist for short periods.Kereszturi, A., E. Rivera-Valentin. 2012.

It was named after Hungarian-American aeronautical engineer Theodore von K√°rm√°n. The crater contains a large field of dunes. Usually, the dunes are very dark because they contain the dark volcanic rock basalt. However, in the winter they are become covered with frost. The pictures below show the frost disappearing. Dark spots appear on dunes in the higher latitudes of Mars. Sometimes geysers form near the spots. They have two main features (dark dune spots and spider channels) that appear at the beginning of the Martian spring on dune fields covered with carbon dioxide (CO2 or 'dry ice'), mainly at the ridges and slopes of the dunes; by the beginning of winter, they disappear. Dark spots' shape is generally round, on the slopes it is usually elongated. In these spots mineral grains may be covered with a thin film of water that may affect chemical weathering of minerals and may help possible Martian organisms to survive. Studies have shown that thin films of water could exist at times on the Martian surface at certain times and in certain locations. In places, thin layers of liquid water could be present for 38 sols (Martian days) in the warmer periods of the day.Zent, A.P., Haberle, R.M., Howard, C.H., Jakosky, B.M., 1993.

It divides the city's waterfront into two, with New Rochelle Harbor to the south and southwest, and Echo Bay, to the north and northeast. Glen Island and Neptune Island lie just to the west of the Neck, and Davids' and Huckleberry islands lie to the south. The Neck is one of the most important historical localities in the City of New Rochelle. Before white settlements, Siwanoy Indians encamped here, finding an abundant source of fish and wildlife. Until the early 19th century tidal mills produced flour and other goods for local use and for export. With the advent of steamboat, and the resorts and inns that sprang up along the waterfront as a result, New Rochelle became an enormously popular destination by the mid-1800s. Davenport Neck was the choice location for the \\"summer homes\\" of wealthy vacationers.  History  300px = Indian villages = It was on the southeast and south shores of this neck that the principal Indian settlements within the limits of New Rochelle were located, primarily on the southerly side of the Neck extending from the cove at the southerly corner of Davenport Park, westerly along the shore. The largest number of stone objects of Indian manufacture collected within the City have been found here, many of them of very fine workmanship, attesting the superior culture of those who inhabited these villages. It is along the shores of Davenport Neck that the greatest number of the specimens in the Indian collection at the headquarters of the Huguenot Historical Association in the Paine Cottage were found. The presence here of articles made from material foreign to the region, in some instances coming from as far away as the Ohio Valley, shows extensive trade relations with other tribes in the West. Such objects include arrowheads, grooved and axes, stone mortars, drills, knives and scrapers. Other similar villages were on the shores of the small creek between the two westerly points of the Neck. Indians visited the sheltered cove and small creek at the west end of the Neck until after the Huguenots had settled the town. Early residents such as Mary Le Counte who died in 1841 at the age of 105 years, had vivid recollections of the Indian villages and their wigwams.Scarsdale History.org It is likely that upon the coming of Europeans to these shores, they found a large part of the neck adjacent to the Indian village sites under cultivation by the Indians, making the locality especially attractive as a place to settle. = Early Europeans = As early as the year 1665, Thomas Mullinax, then a resident of the Town of Westchester, in utter disregard of the purchase that Thomas Pell had made from the Indians in 1654 covering all the later Manor of Pelham, applied to Governor Richard Nicolls for a patent for this neck, which was duly granted to him. Due to the remonstrances of Pell, the Governor subsequently revoked the patent because it was obtained by misinformation. Pell got his patent from Governor Nicolls in October, 1666. The next proprietors were a group of Huguenot settlers who purchased the neck prior to the purchase of the entire town made under the contract between Pell and Jacob Leisler in 1687. However, Leisler also participated in the earlier project, and with the six other purchasers, Jean Bouteillier, Andre Thauvet, Etienne Lumprey, Isaac Broussard Des Champs, Daniel Streing and M. Paquinett, immediately divided the entire neck among themselves into small home lots running from six to forty two acres, Leisler having the largest share. = Huguenot settlement = The influx of Huguenot refugees to New York City, following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, soon made it clear that the projected settlement must be expanded to accommodate many other Huguenots and requiring much more land than was available on the narrow limits of the neck, so a contract to purchase six thousand acres, including the neck, and the balance on the mainland was entered into on July 2, 1687. The several lots on the neck were later bought up by Jacob Leisler and Guillaume LeConte. The neck was first called \\"Pell's Little Neck,\\" to distinguish it from his larger neck located three miles closer to New York City. After Leisler and Le Conte became the joint owners of the entire neck, it was called \\"Leisler's and Le Conte's Neck\\", a name that was retained as late as 1710. Le Conte appears to have taken up his residence on the neck, and the northeasterly promontory, now known as Hudson Park, was known as early as 1703 as \\"Bonnefoy Point\\", being named from David Bonnefoy, LeConte's brother-in-law. In 1708, Jacob Leisler, Jr., who had inherited his father's property, sold his share of the neck to Anthony Lispenard, then a resident of New York City, and, six years later, in 1714, Le Conte's son and daughter sold the share that their father had owned on the neck and which they had inherited, also to Lispenard. Lispenard had already taken up his residence on the neck and he continued to be its owner until the year 1732. In the interval, in 1724, he erected mills and a mill dam between the neck and the main shore. Lispenard sold the neck to Joseph Rodman of Flushing, Long Island, a Quaker, but retained the mills with dam and pond. It is not clear that \\"Lispenard'\\" became the fixed name of the neck, but, for a long period of years after 1732, it was known as \\"Rodman\\". Lispenard erected a house for himself on the neck, to which his successor Rodman made several enlargements. Joseph Rodman died in 1759, and his grandson of the same name succeeded to the ownership of the neck, and the latter, becoming involved in financial difficulties, sold it to John R. Myer, just previous to the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. From him it became known as \\"Myer's Point.\\"Antoine L'Espenard The French Huguenot of New Rochelle = Davenport family = On the 22nd of October, 1776, General Knyphausen landed here with the 2nd Division of Hessians and the Regiment of Waldeckers, and moved forward to join General Howe's army encamped in New Rochelle, before the Battle of White Plains. After the war, in 1784, John R. Myer sold the neck to Newberry Davenport A History of the County of Westchester, from Its First Settlement to the Present Time, p. 439 from whom the neck derives its current name. Davenport later acquired the rights of Hewlett, and, from time to time, until 1820, bought up the small parcels of salt meadow of one to five acres on the neck that had been owned by a number of the early settlers of the town as common lands appurtenant to their several farms on the mainland. In the year 1813, during the Second War with Great Britain, guards of militia were stationed on the neck to prevent a landing of British from the British blockading squadron that was stationed in the Sound. In September, 1813, this squadron moved down to a point opposite New Rochelle and engaged a flotilla of gunboats that came up from the direction of New York City. This affair created much alarm in New Rochelle. In 1814, Davenport divided the neck between his two sons, Newberry Davenport, Jr., and Lawrence Davenport In 1816, Lawrence erected a house on the part given to him by his father. His house is the present Davenport Grange which remained in the family until 1929, when it was given to the City of New Rochelle for a public park. The old Rodman house eventually became the home of Newberry Davenport, Jr., and continued in his family until the death of his daughter, Miss Anna Davenport. The home, referred to as the Lispenard-Rodman- Davenport House, is the oldest standing residential structure in New Rochelle and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Long before this, both branches of the Davenport family sold off large plots of acreage to wealthy persons, who established handsome homes and estates on the neck. The promontory of Bonnefoy Point early came into use as a picnic grove, and a steamboat dock was built there. In 1886, it was old to the Town of New Rochelle for a public park, being given the name of \\"Hudson Park.\\" = Estates = With the advent of the steamboat, and the resorts and inns that sprung up along the shore as a result, New Rochelle became an enormously popular waterfront destination by the mid-1800s. Davenport Neck was a choice location for the summer homes and estates of wealthy vacationers who liked the town so much they often stayed for good. The Iselin banking family built a number of estates with Long Island Sound views. The patriarch Adrian Iselin built the first of these homes, Souci, in 1858. This palatial 16 bedroom home sat on 50 acres of magnificent gardens and was later inherited by his daughter Georgina, and adjoining property was acquired for the summer homes of her brothers. All seven children of Adrian Senior and his wife Elenor eventually made their homes along the waterfront of Davenport Neck and nearby Premium Point. William Iselin's estate eventually became the Davenport Country Club. \\"Tocoran\\", the home of Emilie Iselin and her husband John G. Beresford, was next door and became the Riviera shore club which folded in 1980 and has since become the gated community of Malysana Lane homes. \\"The Paddocks\\", home of Elenor Iselin and her husband Col. Delancey Kane, became the Colony Club and was torn down to become the current Surf Club. Columbus Iselin's Davenport Neck home, \\"Maison Bleu\\", burned down in 1954. The Iselin's left some property for neighbors, including \\"Nutwood\\", located next to the Souci estate, and owned by Clarkson Potter, four time representative to the United States Congress. Between Torcoran and The Paddocks was the Davenport Thorne estate, an 18-acre property which is now the City owned Davenport Park. When Lydia Davenport Thorne bequeathed a parcel of her family owned property to the city of New Rochelle in 1929 she stipulated that it be used for passive recreation only so as to preserve the tranquil aura of the Neck. In the decades following, most of the neighboring mansions and acres were sold off for residential developments, country clubs and marinas.  Hudson Park  The early name of Hudson Park was Bonnefoy Point, and it referred to the entire promontory at the northeast end of Davenport Neck. Guillaume LeConte and Jacob Leisler together bought up the entire neck after the projected Huguenot settlement there on had been expanded by a purchase of a larger tract on the mainland. Le Conte had arrived in New York City in the spring of 1689 from the West Indies, to take charge of the property of his father-in law, Jacques Lasty. Upon making the joint purchase of the neck with Leisler, he took up his residence there, and, in 1703, made a division of the neck with Jacob Leisler, Jr., who had inherited his father's lands in New Rochelle. David Bonnefoy was his brother-in-law and this close relationship and association no doubt brought about the naming of the point from him, and this name for it dates from before 1703 and continued to be used until late in the nineteenth century. As early as 1842, the point was being used for a picnic grove and continued to be so used for nearly half a century under various proprietors. The property came into the ownership of Alexander B. Hudson, from whom it came to be called \\"Hudson Grove.\\" There had been proposals made before that time that the grove be purchased for use as a public park, but it was not until 1886 that the purchase was made. It was then sold to the Town of New Rochelle by Mr. Hudson for $38,000, and has since been known by the name of \\"Hudson Park.\\"The Place Names of Westchester County New York, Richard M.Lederer Jr., Harbor Hill Books, 1978, p. 71 The main attraction is a bathing beach which is open to all residents of the city. The park also has bathhouses, playgrounds, gazebos, greenhouses and a bandshell used for summertime concerts. The New Rochelle Municipal Marina and the New Rochelle Rowing Club are located next to the park along the north-eastern shoreline of the neck.

The English operations, executed by William Roy, consisted of the measurements of bases at Hounslow Heath (1784) and Romney Marsh (1787), the measurements of the angles of the triangles (1787‚Äì1788) and finally the calculation of all the triangles (1788‚Äì1790). The survey is very significant as the first precise survey within Britain, and the forerunner of the work of the Ordnance Survey which was founded in 1791, one year after Roy's death. Cassini's memoir Late in life, when he was 57, Roy was granted the opportunity to establish his lasting reputation in the world of geodesy. The opening came from a completely unexpected direction. In 1783 Cassini de Thury addressed a memoir Concerning the Latitude and Longitude of Greenwich. to the Royal Society in which he expressed grave reservations of the measurements of latitude and longitude which had been undertaken at Greenwich Observatory. He suggested that the correct values might be found by combining the Paris Observatory figures with a precise trigonometric survey between the two observatories. (The French surveys had already been carried out in the course of the preparation of the map of France.) This criticism was roundly rejected by Nevil Maskelyne who was convinced of the accuracy of the Greenwich measurements but, at the same time, he realised that Cassini's memoir provided a means of promoting government funding for a survey which would be valuable in its own right. Approval was granted and Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, proposed that Roy should lead the project. Roy gladly accepted and set matters in motion by submitting to the Crown a grossly-underestimated budget for manpower (by far the largest element) and new precision instruments to be constructed by Jesse Ramsden. The whole project is described in Roy's three large articles in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1785, 1787 and 1790. , and . Accounts of the survey. There are shorter accounts of the project in the History of the Royal Engineers by Porter History of the Corps of Royal Engineers Part III, Chapter II, pages 228‚Äì255. and in every history of the Ordnance Survey, particularly the book by Seymour , A History of the Ordnance Survey pages 33‚Äì36. and also that by Owen and Pilbeam.

The Hounslow Heath base, 1784 The Hounslow Heath baseline (in blue) and Heathrow Airport's perimeter and 2 main runways (in yellow) superimposed on an Ordnance Survey map of 1935 The first task of any survey is to establish a baseline location and, after a search by Roy and three other members of the Royal Society on 16 April, they fixed upon Hounslow Heath, an approximately level piece of ground between King's Arbour (now located within the confines of Heathrow airport) and Hampton Poor-house just over five miles to the south-east. The direction of the baseline was first chosen to suit the lie of the land, but it was seen to almost coincide with the telescopic view toward the steeple of All Saints' church in Banstead, approximately 12 miles away, and the baseline was therefore made to coincide exactly with that direction: it is shown as a dashed line on the map of the survey, below. The ground was cleared of bushes and a preliminary measurement of the line was carried out with a 100 ft. steel chain of 100 links prepared by Jesse Ramsden. It was the intention to measure more accurately with a set of three calibrated deal rods about 20 ft. in length. Three rods at a time were supported on trestles and the ends aligned to an accuracy of a thousandth part of an inch. The first rod was then carried to the end of the third, an operation to be repeated 1370 times. Unfortunately the deal rods had to be abandoned because of their susceptibility to lengthen and shorten in wet weather, and they were replaced by one inch thick glass rods of the same length. The rods were not affected by humidity but it was important to correct for thermal expansion. There was also a correction to sea level since the calculation of the survey was referred to that height. The final measurement gives the length of the base as 27404.01 ft. The measurement of the baseline to such a high standard of precision was a remarkable achievement and in recognition the Royal Society awarded Roy the Copley Medal in 1785. The cannon marking the Hampton end of the baseline in Roy Grove In 1784 the ends of the baseline were marked by the central axes of two vertical wooden pipes over which the theodolite was centred for measurements from the base: the pipes could also support flagstaffs as markers when the base was sighted from other stations (or one end from another). After the resurvey in 1791 the pipes were replaced by cannons which are still in place although it is certain that the cannons have been disturbed and slightly moved over the intervening years. The modern locations of the southeast end points is in Roy Grove, Hampton. The northwest end at Heathrow Airport is situated on the northern perimeter road.Sherwood, Philip.

This led to a certain amount of acrimony and Roy went so far as to accuse Ramsden of being remiss and dilatory‚Äîin public The Tale of the Great Theodolites and in his next report in the Philosophical Transactions. The proposed triangulation mesh.The 1787 report is witness to how Roy occupied himself whilst waiting for the theodolite. The first section deals with the proposed route of the survey. Greater accuracy is achieved if the triangles are kept regular in shape, and the figure shows that most are close to equilateral, with departures only where the triangles step down in size toward the bases and where they have to stretch over the Channel. Typical sides are about 20 miles but the lines which cross the Channel are up to 45 miles in length. The second part of the report is a thorough examination of the results of Cassini's survey of France between Paris and Dunkirk. The third part includes a comparison of seven models for the Figure of the Earth, deduced from both meridian arcs and pendulum experiments, and he goes on to propose further meridian arcs in India and Russia, as well as an arc of longitude at the equator. Finally, he makes a plea for the continuation of the survey to the rest of Great Britain. The triangulation, 1787 The first triangles surveyed Ramsden's theodolite was eventually delivered in the summer of 1787, and all haste was made to complete as much as possible before winter. The first triangles were from the ends of the base to Hanger Hill Tower in Ealing and St Ann's Hill in Chertsey, with an additional sight to Windsor Castle from the NW end only. Thus two angles were measured at the SE end of the base and four angles at the NW end. The theodolite was then moved to Hanger Hill where the ends of the base line were observed from the other direction and another three new sight lines established to Greenwich Observatory, Upper Norwood and Hundred Acres (Banstead). In this way the mesh of triangles was extended down towards the coast where sights could be made on some of the French stations that had been measured in the course of Cassini's triangulation. The figure below shows the actual triangulation, the relief making the structure more understandable. Note the second base at Romney Marsh. By comparing the measured length with the length as calculated through the triangulation mesh it was possible to assess the accuracy of the framework. The actual triangulation mesh. Portable scaffold for the great theodolite, showing the inner and outer supportsThe process seems deceptively simple but it demanded much in the way of perseverance and organisation. Once the theodolite was on a station, signal men were sent to all the other stations that were to be observed from that point, typically five or six stations but as many as 10 in the case of Fairlight Head. For short distances a simple flagstaff would suffice but for the longer sights it was necessary to use lights at night. The brightest lights, so called white lights, were obtained by burning an incendiary mixture that lasted for a short time only. The cross-channel use of these lights entailed careful timing arrangements which could take into account the vagaries of the weather and pocket watches. At many stations, for the theodolite or signals, it was necessary to raise the instrument on a portable tower over 30 ft. high. The tower had two components: an inner frame supported the instrument and the outer supported the observers, thus minimising the disturbance to the instrument. The final report The final report of 1790 presents figures for the distance between Paris and Greenwich as well as the precise latitude, longitude and height of the British triangulation stations. Throughout the survey Roy took every opportunity to fix the position of as many secondary landmarks as possible in the hope that they would be used as a basis for future topographic surveys from which new maps could be prepared for the counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent and Sussex.

In 1882 the club moved from its original site on Pelham Road, to its present location at the east end of Davenport Neck on Echo Bay. The first building at this site was lost to fire around 1900 and was immediately replaced by the current two-story clubhouse. The building is topped by an 1864 clock tower that was removed from the former city hall on Main Street when it was demolished in the 1960s. Club members restored the cupola and added it to the building in 1974. In 1886 the young club defeated the renowned New York Athletic Club, winning its first rowing competition. The sport of rowing became significantly more popular starting in the 1880s. In its early years, the New Rochelle Rowing Club‚Äôs Annual Regatta attracted as many as 1000 members and spectators to the events on Echo Bay. As the club expanded, the club bought new boats, including new four oared gigs with which they went on to claim more racing titles. The popularity of eight oared rowing did not hit until 1908 when they borrowed a boat from the New York Athletic Club and won a major match race. Over the years, the club has won three national rowing championships. The national Intermediate Single Sculls title in 1920, another National title was captured in 1947, and a third in 1964. The club has also participated in numerous major meets. It was the home club of Cy Cromwell and Jim Storm, silver medalists in the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo.NRRC History Superstorm Sandy slammed New Rochelle's waterfront, with Hudson Park and its facilities bearing much of the brunt. The strong tidal surge heavily damaged the hundred-year-old NRRC clubhouse resulting in its questionable future. Calls for renovation and preservation of the structure as well as those for total demolition continue nearly two years after the hurricane.

The mention of the rebel emperor Postumus dates the creation of the altar to 11 September 260.Original publication: Lothar Bakker. \\"Das Siegesdenkmal zur Juthungenschlacht des Jahres 260 n. Chr. aus Augusta Vindelicum.\\" Das Arch√§ologische Jahr in Bayern: Jahrgang 1992 (1993), pp. 116‚Äì119. The stone is kept in the R√∂misches Museum Augsburg. Augsburg Victory Altar Augsburg Victory Altar  Altar and Inscription  The altar, made of Jura limestone, is 1.56 m high, 0.79m wide and 0.75m deep, and was found in 1992 by construction workers in Jakobvorstadt, G√§nsb√ºhl, Augsburg, in a former arm of the Lech, almost 400 m outside the former Roman city area. It is possible that it was originally displayed in the immediate area of the find location at a river crossing. The stone probably also had a statue of the goddess Victoria, but this is now lost; the base plate survives, however (in the same place). As common in this period, it was a recycled monument. The original dedication, dating to the time of Severus Alexander (222-235), managed to survive above the actual inscription, hidden under a lipped stone lid, as were working marks on the side corners of the cornice. The older inscription: The later inscription: Lines 10 and 11 with the names of the Rhaetian governor and the ruler of the Gallic Empire were later erased. The name of the usurper Postumus seems to have been made illegible using a chisel, while the remaining letters of these lines were simply scratched out. However, enough survives for the original text to be fully reconstructed.  Historical context  In autumn/winter of 259 the Juthungi, including the Suebi, crossed the Limes Germanicus and invaded Italy (Failure of the Limes). While Emperor Gallienus managed to defeat the German invasion at Mediolanum in 260, the Juthungi had already stopped further north with thousands of Italian captives and copious booty. The inscription of the victory altar indicates that these were met by regular Roman troops and a provincial levy near the Rhaetian provincial capital, and defeated in a two-day battle (24 and 25 April). Until the discovery of the altar, this event was not known. In addition to the record of this event, the inscription also allows further clarification of the expansion and chronology of the so-called Gallic Empire. Until its discovery, no source indicated that the province of Rhaetia was a part of it; apparently the break-away empire was also established earlier than had previously been assumed. This battle took place in spring, when Emperor Gallienus was still the undisputed and sole ruler of the Empire. But he was not named on the altar since Postumus had already declared himself emperor by the time the inscription was produced in autumn. It was originally assumed that Postumus' usurpation took place only in autumn of 260, but Postumus must have rebelled from his authority already some time before September of this year, probably in June or July. Naturally, after his proclamation a reference to Gallienus was impossible, even though we still don't know when Genialis changed sides. Nevertheless, the political situation changed rapidly. Probably in 262/3, but by 265 at the latest, the Rhaetians were back under the control of Gallienus. At this point followers and supporters of Postumus fell under the damnatio memoriae. The name of Genialis and the consuls as well as the mention of the army were erased from the inscription; probably they were only covered with stucco and remained readable. The composition of the partially Roman army at this battle is typical of the period. This force, led by Genialis, an officer from the equites, lacks any regular units of the Rhaetian provincial army, such as the legio III Italica (which had been stationed at Castra Regina since c.170). Instead the contingent was formed (perhaps rapidly) of Germaniciani (members of units of Upper Germania), milites provinciae Raetiae (presumably auxiliary troops) and populares (\\"locals\\"), which might mean just armed civilians (perhaps veterans). Perhaps the latter were a kind of citizen militia, raised from the residents of the provincial capital and its hinterland and therefore highly motivated to defeat the German raiders.

Founded in 1952, the club currently competes in the National Premier Leagues NSW, with matches played at Northbridge Oval. Northbridge is Australia's largest community club with over 2,500 register players. The club has a youth development academy partnership with A-League club Central Coast Mariners with the teams playing at Northbridge now known as the North Shore Mariners. The partnership allows players from Central Coast Mariners to be loaned to Northbridge FC for playing experience while it also helps promising players coming through the academy to get trials with the A-League Club. History Northbridge FC was established in 1952 by local postman Ron Hall who had previously relocated from his work in the coalfields in the Cessnock area of the Hunter Valley. The club originally competed in the Northern Suburbs Soccer Association (NSSA). The original playing strip was a red and white shirt, white shorts and red and white hooped socks. In 1973, Northbridge joined the Ku-Ring-Gai and District Soccer Association (now the Northern Suburbs Football Association). =Association with Central Coast Mariners= In 2014, Northbridge established an agreement with A-League club Central Coast Mariners to form a youth development academy in Sydney's North Shore. As part of the partnership the North Shore Mariners Academy was based at Northbridge FC. The move led to accusations from Sydney FC that the Mariners were encroaching on their territory. On forming the partnership the Mariners stated that they believe Northbridge to be the biggest club (in terms of player numbers) in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2015, as a result of the Central Coast Mariners affiliation, the club's senior teams changed their name and colours to reflect the Mariners and in doing so, became the North Shore Mariners. Men's Team =NSW State League 1 / NSW NPL 3= In 2011, after spending their entire existence in the local league, Northbridge FC successfully entered Football NSW's state league competition, the 3rd tier of NSW football and fourth tier overall. They won the NSW State League Division One Premiership in 2013, but went on to lose the Grand Final to Balmain in extra time. The 2014 season once again saw Northbridge fall short of the title ‚Äì losing to Hakoah Sydney City East FC 3‚Äì2, with Hakoah going on to get promoted to the NSW NPL2. Throughout 2014 and the years leading up, Northbridge, experienced significant growth, with over 2,300 registered players in early 2014. This made Northbridge the largest club in Australia by participation numbers. In 2015 Northbridge had a successful season losing only one game late in the season (won 18, drew 3, lost 1) to take out the State League 1 premiership. Northbridge went on to win their first State League 1 grand final in 3 attempts beating Hills Brumbies in a 3‚Äì2 win, despite playing the last 15 minutes with 10 men. =NSW NPL 2= The successful 2015 season saw Northbridge promoted to the National Premier Leagues NSW 2 competition for the first time in their history where they started the 2016 season alongside National Premier League debutants Sydney FC Youth, Western Sydney Wanderers FC Youth & Central Coast Mariners FC NPL. Despite being competitive for the majority of games, the seniors only managed to win 3 matches. In the last round of the season, North Shore needed all three senior divisions (U18's, U20's and 1st's) to win and had to rely on other results to avoid relegation. All three divisions won and at the end of 2016 had finished 13th out of 14 on the Club Championship, thus avoiding relegation with Fraser Park FC dropping to the 3rd tier of NSW football instead. 2017 was a much more successful year for the North Shore outfit, with the Mariners finishing the year in 5th position. Another year of improvement in the NPL NSW 2 saw the senior team finish 3rd in the 2018 season. Though North Shore were eliminated in the first round of the finals, season 2018 was the highest league position finish for the club to date. In 2019, North Shore experienced their most successful season in history, finishing first in both the NPL NSW 2 and the club championship, which resulted in promotion to NPL NSW 1. The club sealed promotion on the final round of the season. =NSW NPL 1= As a result of winning the 2019 NPL2 Club Championship North Shore have been promoted to NPL1 for the first time in their history and will play their games out of Lambert Park, Leichhardt. Women's Team The Women's team currently competes in Football NSW Women's NPL Division One however finished the 2019 season in last place. Home ground The club played its home games at Northbridge Oval. The Oval had a million-dollar upgrade, including resurfacing with synthetic turf and new floodlights in early 2011. However, as the ground did not meet the NPL NSW 1 criteria, the men's team had to move to Lambert Park located in Leichhardt for the 2020 season.http://websites.sportstg.com/team_info.cgi?c=1-10179-150725-553558-26640204&a;=SFIX Current squad As of 1 January 2019 Club officials * President: Rory Grace * Technical Director: Ryan Doidge * First Team Manager: Joe Haywood * First Team Assistant Manager: Brian Baker * First Grade Coach: Will Piriz * U20 Manager: Brian Baker * U20 Assistant Coach: Tadhg Purcell * Goalkeeping Coach: Elvis De-Marchi * Club Physio: Matthew Grant-Smith Honours *;National Premier Leagues NSW 2 Club Championship **Winners: 2019 *;National Premier Leagues NSW 2 Premiership **Winners: 2019 *;NSW State League Division One Club Championship **Winners: 2013, 2015 *;NSW State League Division One Premiership **Winners: 2013, 2015 **Runners-up: 2014 *;NSW State League Division One Championship **Winners: 2015 **Runners-up: 2013, 2014 References External links * Official club website Category:Soccer clubs in Sydney Category:Soccer clubs in New South Wales Category:Association football clubs established in 1952 Category:1952 establishments in Australia ","title":"North Shore Mariners FC"},{"id":"45296687","title":"List of Cultural Properties of Japan - archaeological materials (Wakayama)"},{"id":"45296735","text":"The position of Hogan Lovells Professor of Law and Finance was established at the University of Oxford in 2007.

Building upon earlier guides, such as Strunk & White's The Elements of Style and Fowler's A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, it applies science to the process of writing, and explains its prescriptions by citing studies in related fields ‚Äì e.g., grammatical phenomena, mental dynamics, and memory load ‚Äì as well as history and criticism, to \\"distinguish the rules that enhance clarity, grace, and emotional resonance from those that are based on myths and misunderstandings\\". Pinker's prescriptions combine data from ballots given to the Usage Panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, the usage notes of several dictionaries and style guides, the historical analyses in Merriam‚ÄìWebster's Dictionary of English Usage, the meta-analysis in Roy Copperud's American Usage and Style: The Consensus, and views from modern linguistics represented in The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language and the blog Language Log. Contents =Prologue= \\"Style\\" is the effective use of words to engage the human mind. Style manuals that are innocent of linguistics are crippled in dealing with the aspect of writing that evokes the most emotion: correct and incorrect usage. Orthodox stylebooks are ill-equipped to deal with a fundamental fact about language: it changes over time. Language is not a protocol legislated by an authority but rather an evolving set of tacit standards from the contributions of millions of writers and speakers. =Good writing= Reverse- engineering good prose as the key to developing a writerly ear ‚Äì The starting point for becoming a good writer is to be a good reader. Good writers are avid readers. They have absorbed a vast inventory of words, idioms, constructions, tropes, and rhetorical tricks, and with them a sensitivity to how they mesh and how they clash. This is the elusive \\"ear\\" of a skilled writer ‚Äì the tacit sense of style which cannot be explicitly taught. =A window onto the world= Classic style as an antidote for academese, bureaucratese, corporatese, legalese, officialese, and other kinds of stuffy prose ‚Äì The key to good style, far more than obeying any list of commandments, is to have a clear conception of the make-believe world in which you're pretending to communicate. A writer of classic prose must simulate two experiences: showing the reader something in the world, and engaging the reader in conversation. Classic style is an ideal. Not all prose should be classic, and not all writers can carry off the pretense. But knowing the hallmarks of classic style will make anyone a better writer, and it is \\"the strongest cure for the disease that enfeebles academic, bureaucratic, corporate, legal, and official prose\\". =The curse of knowledge= The main cause of incomprehensible prose is the curse of knowledge ‚Äì the difficulty of imagining what it is like for someone else not to know something that you know. Be aware of specific pitfalls that it sets in your path, e.g., the use of jargon, abbreviations, and technical vocabulary. Show a draft to some people who are similar to your intended audience, and find out whether they can follow it. Show a draft to yourself, after enough time has passed that the text is no longer familiar. Rework and revise. =The web, the tree, and the string= Understanding syntax can help a writer avoid ungrammatical, convoluted, and misleading prose ‚Äì Learning how to bring the units of language into consciousness can allow writers to reason their way to grammatically consistent sentences, and to diagnose problems. Grammar is a fascinating subject in its own right, when it is properly explained. =Arcs of coherence= How to ensure that readers will grasp the topic, get the point, keep track of the players, and see how one idea follows from another ‚Äì Even if every sentence in a text is crisp, lucid, and well formed, a succession of them can feel choppy, disjointed, unfocused, incoherent. A coherent text is a designed object: an ordered tree of sections within sections, crisscrossed by arcs that track topics, points, actors, and themes, and held together by connectors that tie one proposition to the next. Like other designed objects, it comes about not by accident but by drafting a blueprint, attending to details, and maintaining a sense of harmony and balance. =Telling right from wrong= How to make sense of the rules of correct grammar, word choice, and punctuation ‚Äì The idea that there are exactly two approaches to usage ‚Äì all the traditional rules must be followed, or else anything goes ‚Äì is a myth. The first step in mastering usage is to understand why the myth is wrong. There is no such thing as a \\"language war\\" between prescriptivists and descriptivists. \\"The alleged controversy is as bogus as other catchy dichotomies such as nature versus nurture and America: Love It or Leave It.\\" The key is to recognize that the rules of usage are tacit conventions. A convention is an agreement among the members of a community to abide by a single way of doing things. Linguists capture their regularities in \\"descriptive rules\\" ‚Äì that is, rules that describe how people speak and understand. A subset of these conventions is less widespread and natural, but has become accepted by a smaller community of literate speakers for use in public forums such as government, journalism, literature, business, and academia. These conventions are \\"prescriptive rules\\" ‚Äì rules that prescribe how one ought to speak and write in these forums. Unlike the descriptive rules, many of the prescriptive rules have to be stated explicitly, because they are not second nature to most writers: the rules may not apply in the spoken vernacular, or they may be difficult to implement in complicated sentences which tax the writer's memory. This raises the question of how a careful writer can distinguish a legitimate rule of usage from a tall tale. The answer: look it up. Pinker includes a short guide to a hundred of the most commonly raised issues of grammar, word usage, and punctuation. (For Pinker's Top 10 list, see .) Reception The Sense of Style won Plain English Campaign's International Award for 2014, and was ranked among the best books of 2014 by The Economist, The Sunday Times, and Amazon. It received mainly positive reviews from several major publications, including The New York Times, Scientific American, and The Washington Post, and a negative review from The New Yorker. The Telegraph states Pinker \\"doesn't have anything new to say\\" and criticizes Pinker for allegedly \\"logrolling\\" in his choice of which authors to quote.

He was also a member of the Georgetown Corporation's Common Council. Casanave is particularly remembered by directing the construction and having laid the Cornerstone in what later became in the White House on October 12, 1792. Although we have little data about him.  Biography Casanave was born in Navarra, Spain in about 1766. He was the thirteenth son of a lawyer and trader of Navarra. He emigrated in Georgetown (in modern Washington DC) in 1785, having only 200 pounds and being almost unable to speak English. However, before long, Casanave established his first business, a shop dedicated to the sale of salt (which was the cheapest in Baltimore), rum and sugar, as well as oil, pork meat, pomatum, and powder for the hair. The establishment of the store, established despite his limited money, was probably carried out with the economic help of his friend George Washington, whom he knew through his uncle, Juan de Miralles (who was agent to the Continental Congress since 1778 until his death, in 1780, William W. Warner (1994), page 250. serving like linkage between the Spanish Crown and the American insurgents during the War of the Independence, taking a prominent role in the American Revolution). In 1790, Casanave founded a nail manufactory, which become in the first company of its kind in Georgetown, and a Night Dancing-School for men. In addition, Casanave became in real state agent, selling soils in the modern Georgetown. Between late 1790 and 1793 he became an \\"agent\\" and sponsor students who studied at Georgetown College. There, he was administrator of the funds of the students, covering their expenses. When students had not sufficient resources to pay for their studies, Casanave paid them with his own money. Apparently, Casanave perfected his still deficient English at this college (to the point that he taught English to several immigrants), and later one of his sons, also called Peter, studied there. Pedro Casanave directed the construction of the White House and laid the first stone underneath it. In late of 1792, Casanave laid the Cornerstone and directed the construction in what later became the White House. Thus, on 12 October of this year (coinciding with the 300th anniversary of the Discovery of Americas by Christopher Columbus), after presiding the ceremony of laying of the first stone of the ‚ÄúHouse of the President‚Äù (which was, particularly, a Masonic ceremony of the Lodge n¬∫9, and that was celebrated at the Fountain Inn tavern, where the upper class normally met), he and the inaugural procession came to a solar (where would be built the Presidential Palace) and Casanave laid the Cornerstone for the White House's construction and pronounced a Masonic prayer. On top of the cornerstone a bronze plaque was established, in which can be read: The first stone of the President's House was laid the 12th day of October 1792, and in the 17th Year of the Independence of the United States of America. In 1793 he joined the Georgetown's Corporation Common Council and, the following year, he was elected mayor of Georgetown, thus being the fifth person to hold the position. He died in 1796. Although we do not know exactly how old he was at this time, on base on some testimonials about their participation in the inauguration of the President's House, he must have been about thirty years old.  Personal life In September 1791, after becoming real state agent, he married a Catholic girl from Georgetown, Ann Nancy Young, whose father, Notley Young, was a prominent businessman and merchant of the city, putting the sale of soils. The family of Nancy Young was one of the more important families of Maryland. Casanave and Young lived on a propriety, then called \\"Casanovia\\", at a mansion house located in near of modern Delaware Avenue, in Georgetown. Casanave and Young had two children: Peter and Joane Casanave. Possibly his real name was not Casanave, since the few surviving sources indicate his surname as Casaneva, Casenave, Cazenave and Casanova. Apparently, Casanave was catholic and freemason (brotherhood to which he joined in sometime already living in the US), serving as Masonic Master of the Maryland Lodge n¬∫9.

Weis-Corbley says that it is a \\"clearinghouse for the gathering and dissemination of positive, compelling new stories,\\" to promote a well-balanced perspective, as opposed to a junk food diet of sensationalistic media stories. In an article about Weis-Corbley, Tal Ben-Shahar, an expert on positive psychology and Harvard University lecturer, said that our perception of the world is warped by continual viewing of bad news. \\"While the media focuses on a small number of frauds‚Äîwhich it should certainly report on‚Äîit entirely ignores the millions or billions of honest transactions that take place every day...

Her story has inspired poem and song.  History  Only one poem by the poet has survived, but among the most famous work is an ode to Myfanwy Fychan \\"of Castell Dinas Br√¢n\\": > Lliw eiry cynnar pen Aran, > Lloer bryd, lwys fryd o lys Fr√¢n. > [the] colour of the early snow on the top of Aran, > with the countenance of the moon, from the court of Br√¢n Castell Dinas Br√¢n was in ruins by the time the poem was written, but it seems that Myfanwy ferch Iorwerth Ddu was the girl that Hywel was writing about. Myfanwy married Goronwy Fychan ap Tudur, and she is the subject of many poems written by her husband as well as poets. The fact that Hywel ab Einion's poem is titled \\"Ode to Myfanwy Fychan of Castell Dinas Br√¢n\\" suggests that title was written later than the poem itself, and that the poem was written before Myfanwy married. It is however also possible that the music belongs to the amour courtois tradition of singing to married women. The alabaster tombstone of Goronwy Fychan, who died in 1382, along with a statue of him and his wife, can be found in the parish church of Penmynydd.  Romanticism of the 19th century  The text of the poem by Hywel ab Einion Llygliw was printed in The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales which brought it to national prominence. A translation by Thomas Pennant ensured that it was well-known to historians and antiquarians in Wales and beyond. The poem was the inspiration for the popular poem Myfanwy Fychan by John Ceiriog Hughes. It was composed for the Llangollen Eisteddfod in 1858 and was published for the first time two years later in the book Oriau'r Hwyr (The Late Hours). It is a typical Victorian poem, which describes a very lyrical and lovelorn Hywel ab Einion and Myfanwy Fychan. In the poem, the qualities and features of the fair maiden are extolled in a deliberate response to the damning report on the Welsh morality contained within a contemporary Parliamentary report (known as the Treachery of the Blue Books). The words were put to music by Joseph Parry and published under the title Myfanwy, which went on to become one of the most popular Welsh songs ever.  Bibliography  * W. J.

The crash is the deadliest in Metro-North's history, and at the time the deadliest rail accident in the United States since the June 2009 Washington Metro train collision, which killed nine passengers and injured 80. The crash occurred after traffic on the adjacent Taconic State Parkway had been detoured onto local roads following a car accident that closed the road in one direction. At the grade crossing, a sport utility vehicle (SUV) driven by Ellen Brody of nearby Edgemont was caught between the crossing gates when they descended onto the rear of her car as the train approached from the south. Instead of backing into the space another driver had created for her, she went forward onto the tracks. Brody died when her vehicle was struck by the train; as her vehicle was pushed along the tracks it loosened more than of third rail, which broke into sections and went through the exterior of the first car, killing five passengers and starting a fire. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) focused on two issues in the accident: how the passengers were killed, since that rarely occurs in grade crossing collisions; and why Brody went forward into the train's path. After an unusually long delay for such investigations that it declined to explain, the board's 2017 final report found no defects with the vehicles, the crossing signage and associated traffic signal preemption, or the train engineer's performance. It found that the failure of the third rail to break into smaller segments contributed to the fatalities on the train; while the report ruled out proposed explanations for Brody's behavior such as the placement of her car's gear shift lever, it could not offer any of its own. Despite the report's findings, lawsuits against the town of Mount Pleasant, which maintains the road along which the grade crossing is located, Westchester County, the railroad and the engineer are proceeding. Background Bombardier M7A electric multiple units, similar to those forming the No. 659 train At about 5:30 p.m. on February 3, 2015, 14 minutes after sunset, a vehicle traveling south along the Taconic State Parkway north of the hamlet of Valhalla in the town of Mount Pleasant, in central Westchester County north of New York City, struck another vehicle making a turn onto Lakeview Avenue from the northbound parkway. Responding emergency services closed both lanes of the southbound Taconic and one northbound lane. Drivers heading in both directions left the parkway, seeking alternate routes back to it on local surface roads. Almost 15 minutes later, at 5:44 p.m., Train 659 of Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, which provides commuter rail service along an route from New York City to Wassaic in northeastern Dutchess County, departed Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, south of Valhalla. It was an express train of eight carriages, formed by four Bombardier M7A electric multiple units, bound for the Southeast station in Putnam County, with Chappaqua its first scheduled stop. At the controls was Stephen Smalls, a 32-year-old resident of Orange County, a three-year Metro- North employee. He had been an engineer for nine months. The part of the parkway in Valhalla remained closed. One detour available to northbound traffic involved using Lakeview Avenue and turning at the large Kensico Cemetery, a short distance to the west. Lakeview Avenue crossed the two tracks using a grade crossing. The next such crossing was Commerce Street, a lightly traveled local road to the north that intersects the tracks diagonally. It continues northwest through the cemetery for a quarter-mile (), then turns north again down a slight rise back over another grade crossing, just north of a brick electrical substation, to a signal-controlled intersection with the parkway. After a crash at the Commerce Street crossing in 1984 that had killed the driver of the van involved, boom barriers had been installed. Accident alt=Train tracks going from lower right to mid-left cross, at grade, with metal plating around the tracks, a paved road going lower left to an intersection at a divided highway with a traffic light just above the tracks. Two railroad crossing signs with red-and-white-striped barriers in the up position are on either side of the tracks. A pine tree's branches protrude into the image from the left; across the divided highway are more woods, with trees beginning show leaf, slightly mited under an overcast sky The parkway was still closed after 6 p.m., Hereafter cited as NTSB Report; page numbers will be those given by the PDF software, rather than those indicated in the document's pages. when a 2011 Mercedes-Benz ML350 SUV driven by Ellen Schaeffer Brody, 49, of Edgemont, went north on Commerce back towards the parkway. Brody had left a Chappaqua jewelry store, where she worked part-time in sales, at 6 p.m.; she was going to meet a potential bookkeeping client at a coffee shop in Scarsdale. Unable to continue south on the Taconic at Lakeview, she turned west, then north up Commerce Street, towards the intersection she had previously passed. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) later theorized she was hoping the accident had been cleared enough to allow her to return to the southbound Taconic. Cell phone records show that Brody's husband, Alan, called and spoke to her for almost nine minutes at 6:11, during which time she was apparently still on the Taconic. He told investigators later that during the call he gave her directions to the Scarsdale meeting; other than complaining about a cable bill they both felt was too high, there was nothing out of the ordinary about the conversation. It could not be determined if she had the phone on speaker, which would have allowed her to keep both hands on the wheel, but according to Alan, the ML350 was equipped with software that automatically detected the phone if it was in the vehicle and put it on speaker. Alan, who had once worked as a conductor in his native South Africa, did not believe she was familiar with the area through which she was driving, or that she was familiar with grade crossings. The call was dropped at 6:19; Alan was not sure if it was because his phone or his wife's had lost power. Shortly afterwards she apparently reached the site of the road accident at the Lakeview intersection and took the detour for reasons unknown. Behind her was a vehicle driven by Rick Hope of Yorktown Heights, returning home from his job in White Plains. He told the investigators that traffic was stop-and-go on Lakeview and Commerce. Both Hope and Brody had stopped for a few seconds at the grade crossing. At the grade crossing, Train 659 was approaching on the western track. The crossing gates descended, warning lights began flashing and, according to Hope, bells began ringing. Hope says Brody's SUV was in front of the gate as it descended, but not on the tracks. The crossing gate struck the top of Brody's SUV before sliding down its rear and becoming stuck. Hope backed up to give her room to do the same. He instead saw Brody get out and walk to the rear, apparently trying to free it. \\"She wasn't in a hurry at all, but she had to have known that a train was coming.\\" he said. At the head of the train, Smalls told investigators he first noticed something reflecting light from within the crossing when it was ahead. He soon realized it was from a vehicle fouling the tracks, and immediately hit the air brakes and sounded the horn, earlier than he would have been required to take the latter action if the tracks appeared clear, in the hope that the vehicle would hear it and leave since he knew he could not stop the train in time. =Collision= Brody then returned to her vehicle and, according to Hope, paused briefly. Then the car moved forward, 30 seconds after the gate had come down on her car, investigators determined later. In the cab, Smalls saw the ML350 completely block the tracks when the train was one car length, approximately away, and braced for impact. The train, traveling at , struck the SUV on its passenger side. at 6:26 p.m. \\"There was a terrible crunching sound, and just like that, the car was gone,\\" Hope said. \\"Disappeared. It happened instantly. There's no way she could have known what hit her.\\" In the train's front car, Chris Gross was suddenly thrown out of his seat. \\"I heard a loud bang and a lot of screaming,\\" he recalled. Flames were within a foot (30 cm) of his face; another passenger got the emergency exit open and pulled him out. The five passengers who died were all sitting near him, he claimed. Jamie Wallace, in the second car, said that passengers there initially tried to come to the aid of those in the front car, but \\"we could not get the head car doors open for some reason - it was jammed.\\" After failed efforts to break the door open, \\"[a] number of us started smelling fumes from the car, the fuel, and we said, 'You know what, we need to get out.'\\" Due to disruptions in the railroad's electrical system created by the accident, the third rails were not completely de-energized immediately. Damage to a transition jumper isolated the rail on the east of the track, south of the intersection, from its counterpart west of the track and north of the intersection. The former lost power within eight seconds of the collision. But circuit breakers that had detected the loss in power to the former restored it to the last four cars of the train, which remained in contact with that rail, until a manual override was sent a minute and a half afterwards. =Fire= alt=A rail passenger car interior with no upholstery, showing many burn marks and other fire damage. Several long pieces of metal are piled in the center near the back end of the car. The third rail sections lifted up and punctured the floor of the first car, with the first short segment remaining on the floor while later ones, with one exception that came through a different hole, accumulated atop the seats in the center of the compartment. A final one went up into the roof and punctured the second car at that point as well. \\"As the train went on you just heard more of the metal against metal. And all the seats seemed to be like collapsing\\", one passenger in the lead car recalled in an NTSB interview. Another said that moments after being thrown into the next seat by the impact, he saw a section of rail go through the seat he had just been in. Passengers in the first car reported small fires breaking out right after the crash, which investigators determined later were fueled by a combination of flaming debris of the third-rail cover, materials from Brody's ML350 and interior components of the train car. While none of the third rail components showed any sign of electrical arcing, there was some localized burn damage on some segments. =Rescue efforts= Smalls went back into the burning train several times to rescue passengers. \\"He did everything he could,\\" said Anthony Bottalico, head of Association of Commuter Rail Employees, the labor union which represents Metro-North workers. The train knocked Brody's SUV a distance of up the tracks, dislodging more than of the third rail, and breaking it into 13 segments, most of which accumulated in the front car's passenger compartment, and then into the second car. The New York Daily News reported that injuries from them were responsible for most of the deaths on the train; later it was reported that four of them had, like Brody, died of blunt force trauma. Passengers further back in the train heard explosions. \\"The thing that precipitated people really starting to freak out and break the glass and open the door was there was a loud 'bam,' explosion-type thing,\\" said Fred Buonocore, who was in the fourth car. \\"And once we jumped off the side, there was another explosion to a lesser degree.\\" At the very rear, passengers said they felt only a small jolt. \\"It felt not even like a short stop, and then the train just completely stopped,\\" said Neil Rader, who was sitting in the middle-back of the train. The Valhalla volunteer fire department and ambulance corps responded; injured passengers were taken to nearby Westchester Medical Center (WMC). By the time the firefighters reached the scene, they said later, the first car was almost fully engulfed and thus there was little they could do to help evacuate it; most of the passengers had already managed to do so on their own by either going out the front door or removing the windows, primarily with tools provided but in some instances forcibly. The firefighters were, however, able to suppress the fire before it had seriously affected the second car. To facilitate triage and busing evacuated passengers from the scene, the Taconic was closed in both directions at the intersection. Aftermath alt=A line of people, seen from behind, boarding two buses. The nearer one has \\"MNR service\\" on its front display. It is dark, with orangish- colored streetlights illuminating snow Brody and five passengers aboard the train were killed. The lead car caught fire and was eventually destroyed. Damage was estimated at $3.7 million. Uninjured passengers, who had either escaped or had been evacuated, were taken to a nearby climbing gym called The Cliffs, where they were able to stay warm until buses arrived. Nine surviving passengers were taken to WMC, with one in very serious condition. A police helicopter with thermal imaging equipment scanned the nearby Kensico Cemetery in search of survivors who might have wandered away from the scene and collapsed into the snow, but found none. There were a total of six deaths and fifteen injuries. As a result of the crash, Harlem Line service was suspended between Pleasantville and North White Plains. On the afternoon of February 4, the day after the incident, the NTSB gave permission for Metro-North crews to clear the site. A crew of a hundred cleared the vehicles, using a high-rail crane to remove the SUV. The train was towed to Metro-North's North White Plains yard after 6 p.m., and workers proceeded to repair the damaged third rail. Metro-North service resumed the next morning, with delays of 15 minutes for trains to slow down at the accident site. Commerce Street reopened to car traffic on the afternoon of February 5. At that point in 2015, it was the deadliest passenger train crash in the United States since the 2009 Washington Metro train collision, which killed nine people and injured 80 others. It is also the deadliest crash in Metro-North's history and was the second Metro- North train incident to result in passenger fatalities, after the derailment 14 months earlier on the railroad's Hudson Line near Spuyten Duyvil that killed four. = Fatalities = All but one of the victims were Westchester residents. All of the dead train passengers worked in Manhattan; three of them worked in finance, and two of them at the same firm. The victims were: * Ellen Schaeffer Brody, 49, of Edgemont, driver of the SUV, and a bookkeeper and sales associate at a Chappaqua jewelry store * Robert Dirks, 36, of Chappaqua, a computational chemist at D.E. Shaw Research in Manhattan * Walter Liedtke, 69, of Bedford Hills, curator of European art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and author of a two-volume guide to the Dutch paintings in the museum's collection * Joseph Nadol, 42, of Ossining, an aerospace and defense equity analyst at JPMorgan Chase * Aditya Tomar, 41, of Danbury, Connecticut, vice president for technology supporting the JP Morgan Chase asset management team * Eric Vandercar, 53, of Bedford Hills, senior managing director of international sales and trading at the New York office of Mesirow Financial All the deaths save one of the train passengers were attributed to blunt force trauma; that exception was due to burns and other injuries making it difficult to determine the cause. None of the passengers had soot in their airways. =Social and cultural commentary= Chappaqua's old station building, listed on the alt=A brownish stone one-story building with a low hipped roof covered in green tile, seen from a three-quarter angle across pavement. From its right protrudes a similarly treated narrow pavilion; on its front, near the left side, is a small porte-cochere adorned with an American flag, its entrance blocked off by small orange plastic cones. Behind the structure are an iron fence, railroad tracks, some portions of modern concrete structures, and trees. The accident drew some commentary on what it said about the nature of suburban life in central Westchester County, where many communities owe not only their original development but their continuing affluence to the commuter rail service of Metro-North and its predecessors. In Chappaqua, where the train was to make its first stop, the effect was pronounced, as three of the victims had connections to the hamlet. Dirks lived there, Brody worked there and Nadol was a member of a local Episcopal church. While early fears that the fatalities would mostly be from Chappaqua were unfounded, as most commuters from the hamlet ride in the rear cars for the shorter walk to the parking lot once the train does stop, residents nonetheless felt anxious, knowing they, too, would eventually have to take the train again. One local shopkeeper, a 30-year resident, told The New York Times that she would never ride the front car of any train, ever. \\"I remember hoping and praying it wasn't anyone I knew. But ... you don't want it to be anyone anybody knows.\\" \\"[T]he exposure goes well beyond simply knowing people on the train,\\" said a psychiatrist at a nearby hospital. \\"Many of these communities only exist because people are able to travel into the city for work and fun and to see family,\\" said The Rev. Gwyneth MacKenzie Murphy, the interim pastor at Nadol's Church of St. Mary the Virgin. \\"So this has hit us at a place that is just integral to our existence, and therefore in a place where we are very, very vulnerable.\\" Writing in The New Yorker, Sam Tanenhaus, who by then had been living in nearby Tarrytown for over 25 years, saw the accident as highlighting \\"the paradox of Westchester\\". Parkways such as the Taconic, and winding roads like Commerce, once represented the county's rural charm, the possibility of living in the country yet close to the city, but while they were still charming they were now, with the area so heavily developed, \\"treacherous\\" with traffic. \\"[L]ife 'in the country' increasingly replicates the ills of the city left behind.\\" Tanenhaus saw the car's collision with a commuter train as another indicator of the way in which Westchester had left the contradictions between its past and present unresolved. Not only is Westchester one of the few places in the country where many workers still commute by rail, all the five passengers who had died were men, recalling the mid-20th century when commuters were overwhelmingly male, working in the city while their wives tended the suburban homes. The accident seemed to him almost to be something from the works of writer John Cheever, who lived in nearby Briarcliff Manor and set much of his fiction amid the suburbs, featuring commuters as his characters: \\"[He] might have conjured the haunting details of the Harlem Line crash: the lead-footed irony of 'Valhalla,' the survivors wandering through the cemetery to safety.\\" Investigation The train involved in the accident at a maintenance facility for further examination On the night of the accident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened an investigation into the accident, and dispatched a go-team to the site. They planned to stay for a week, collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses. =Theories and issues= Investigators said they were particularly interested in one of the crash's unusual aspects. \\"We do have grade-crossing accidents, and most of the time it's fatal for occupants of the vehicles, and not for train passengers,\\" Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB told The Journal News, Westchester County's main daily newspaper. \\"We intend to find out what makes this accident different.\\" George Bibel, author of Train Wreck: The Forensics of Rail Disasters, agreed that this is uncommon. \\"Normally you'd expect the train to sweep the car off the tracks,\\" he said. However, there were other exceptions to this pattern, such as the 2005 Glendale train crash in southern California, at that time the deadliest in the history of Metrolink, where an SUV abandoned at a grade crossing by a driver who decided not to commit suicide after all derailed the train that struck it, killing 11. The wedge-shaped end of the third rail used on Metro-North. The wedge facilitates connection with the shoe at grade crossings, but was implicated in the behavior of the rail in the collision Another unusual aspect was the configuration of the third rail. Unlike other American commuter-rail agencies that operate trains powered by third rails, which have a contact shoe on top of their third rail, Metro-North trains' contact shoes draw current from the bottom of the third rail during operation. The railroad's under-running third rails are designed in order to prevent ice from building up on top during winter months and reduce the possibility of inadvertent contact with the high-voltage rail; as a consequence, they are much safer than the traditional over-running third rails. To facilitate this, the ends of the third rails adjacent to grade crossings have a slight upturn. \\"This has never happened before, and this is a rare configuration of a third rail,\\" U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer said. \\"Do those two add up to the explanation for this terrible, terrible tragedy? Very possibly.\\" But Steve Ditmeyer, a former Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) official, told the Associated Press it would be impossible to be sure that an under-running shoe lifted the rail without also doing tests to see if the same thing would happen in the more common over-running configuration. The NTSB team theorized that the fire aboard the train might have been caused by gasoline from the SUV, ignited by a spark from the third rail, which had pierced the car's fuel tank, and the force of impact. However, said Sumwalt, \\"the big question everyone wants to know is: Why was this vehicle in the crossing?\\" The NTSB team believed the crossing was functioning properly, but was aware also that the earlier accident on the Taconic had led to more traffic through it. \\"We want to understand what, if any, effect that detour had in setting up this accident.\\" An NTSB investigator examines the damaged train car Some area residents suggested the crossing itself was the problem. County Executive Rob Astorino, who said his commute takes him through that area, called the intersections and turns \\"very confusing for drivers\\". Lance Sexton, a Manhattan resident who commutes to the area to assemble electronic equipment, described using it to The New York Times: \\"[C]oming down the hill of the cemetery, you have to put the brakes on earlier ... There's a bank there that always collects water, making it even more dangerous.\\" He also said he and his coworkers often complained about how quickly the train came after the gates went down, gates which had been installed after a 1984 crash killed a van driver. \\"How safe is that crossing‚Äîfor this to happen again?\\" that victim's sister asked the newspaper. While the crossing had undergone upgrades in recent years, including brighter lights and an additional sign warning passing drivers not to stop on the tracks, in 2009 another upgrade, which would have added a sign with flashing lights up the road west of the tracks was not installed. \\"It's way too early to be guessing about what could have or couldn't have made a difference,\\" said a spokesman for the New York State Department of Transportation. Three days later, the NTSB investigators announced that all safety features at the crossing‚Äîthe gate, the train's horn, and a sign away warning drivers not to stop on the tracks‚Äîwere in good working order and had functioned properly at the time of the accident. The gates had gone down 39 seconds before the train reached the crossing, they said, meaning Brody had spent almost that amount of time inside them. They next focused on whether she was familiar with the road and whether she was using a phone at the time; later her cellphone records showed the call to her husband that had ended six minutes before the accident, during which, he said, she had told him that she was unsure of where she was. Several weeks after the accident, the design of the ML350's gear shift lever, a small paddle that protrudes from the steering column, rather than the usual large lever between the seats, was suggested as a possible cause of the accident. To put the car in drive, the driver must push the paddle down; pulling it up puts it in reverse. The Brodys had only bought the car two months earlier, Consumer Reports noted, and it was possible Ellen might have still been getting used to this newer method of changing gears, and making the occasional mistake, such as her otherwise apparently inexplicable move into the train's path after Hope had backed up to allow her to do so as well. \\"If someone isn't familiar with one of these systems, they could do exactly the wrong thing in an emergency,\\" said the magazine's director of auto testing, Jake Fisher, who admitted to having made that mistake more than once. Reports and conclusions NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt presents information on the crash The NTSB released a preliminary report into the accident on February 23, 2015. Two years after the accident, however, it had still not released its final report. Local officials who awaited any safety recommendations the board was expected to make, including Rep. Nita Lowey, contrasted that with the ten months it took the NTSB to issue its final report on the December 2013 Spuyten Duyvil derailment on Metro- North's Hudson Line, which killed four, and the 16 months it took to issue its report on the 2008 California wreck that had prompted Congress to mandate positive train control. The NTSB did not explain why it was taking so long but said it expected the final report to come out in spring 2017. In July 2017, the NTSB released its final report, which found the probable cause of the accident to be \\"the driver of the sport-utility vehicle, for undetermined reasons, moving the vehicle on to the tracks\\". In addition, the driver stopping within the crossing and leaving the vehicle during the warning period, the third rail penetrating the passenger car, and the post-accident fire were all found to be contributing factors. =Driver's behavior= The original question, why Brody had driven forward into the path of the train and thus made the accident inevitable, could not be answered conclusively due to her death. The NTSB had investigated some of the theories that had been put forth. It found many of them unlikely or insufficient explanations for her action. Brody appeared to have slept well, according to her husband, in the days leading up to the accident. Her cell phone records showed no sign that she was awake between midnight and 9 a.m. when she usually slept, and her coworkers said she had exhibited no exhaustion at her job. She took medication for her hypothyroidism, which could have left her fatigued if she had missed a dose, but her husband said that did not appear to have happened. The investigators also considered whether Brody had been able to hear or see the train coming. Using a similar 2011 ML350, they measured the volume of the train horn at the distances where she might have been able to get out of the train's way. They found that the horn became distinctly louder from inside the vehicle when it was away, about four seconds before impact. From , the horn's volume was measured at 93.5 decibels (dB), 50.5 dB louder than ambient noise level inside the Mercedes, much higher than the 13 dB level above ambient recommended by ISO 7731 for audibility of emergency signals and warnings. The investigators allowed, however, that their tests were done with the car's radio and heater off, which may not have been the case with Brody's car that night. Whether the train's lights were visible or not was harder to determine. From where Brody was when she was out of her car, on its driver's side, the vehicle itself as well as the nearby substation would have partially obscured the approaching train. Other light sources in the area, from other vehicles (as Hope had speculated), the perimeter of a nearby building and her own car, may also have distracted her as she returned to the ML350. alt=A rectangular image showing the upper part of a black automobile steering wheel, with a hand at lower right and a dashboard visible in the background. A yellow ellipse is around a small lever protruding from the right of the steering column behind the wheel; in the lower left quarter of the image is a closer view of this lever, also within a yellow ellipse. On the lever the letters R, N and D in white are arranged top to bottom in a central column with triangles pointing in opposite directions next to them on the left, and a letter P with a triangle pointing away from it on the right. The report next considered whether Brody might have made a mistake with the shifter, as speculated. While prior to purchasing the used ML350 two months earlier she had driven a Honda with a shifter in the more common position between the front seats, her husband told the NTSB that she had not told him of any problems using the column-mounted shifter, which he had also used when driving her car and found easy to get used to. The investigators consulted with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and found neither recalls nor complaints related to the shifter positioning or operation. They noted that the motions required for drive and reverse on the test ML350 were similar to those required for a floor-based shifter, and concluded there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" that the column-mounted shifter was a factor in the accident. While the Mercedes was equipped with a GPS navigation system, Brody's husband was not sure whether she used it. Had she done so, it might have provided additional warning that a grade crossing was nearby. The NTSB noted that the Federal Railroad Administration had been working to update its grade crossing database and provide it to the manufacturers of GPS systems; it expected to have that done by late 2017. Ultimately, the NTSB theorized that Brody was distracted by the gate that had hit the rear of her car and the possibility that it had been dented. \\"This focus likely consumed her attention; hindering her ability to detect, perceive, and respond to audible and visual cues that the train was approaching,\\" its report said. \\"[We] conclude that after the grade crossing activated, the driver's attention was most likely diverted to the crossing gate arm striking her vehicle, and she was unaware of the proximity of the approaching train.\\" =Traffic signal preemption= Beyond Brody, the NTSB found some issues with the infrastructure. The traffic signal preemption circuits for both the grade crossing and the Taconic, meant to extend the green signal for vehicles on Commerce when the crossing is activated, were in good working order but it could not be determined which of the two was taking precedence at the time of the accident since there was no recording device. Investigators did, however, find that the circuits gave precedence to the highway signal when its preemption was on, in violation of the federal Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which mandates that the grade crossing preemption circuit always has priority in situations where a crossing is in close proximity to a traffic light. This did not appear to have contributed to the accident, as Smalls had said there was nothing in front of her and she could easily have cleared the tracks had she become aware sooner of the oncoming train. Nevertheless, in May 2015, the state Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) adjusted the preemptions at the scene to give proper precedence to the crossing circuit when activated and extended the green signal for traffic on Commerce from the existing 2‚Äì10-second range, to 29 seconds, followed by four seconds of yellow, to allow even long vehicles like tractor trailers to clear the crossing. NYSDOT also directed its regions to ensure that every other such signal in the state was in compliance with the MUTCD requirement. =Design of third rails= The NTSB did not address whether Metro-North's use of under-running third rails had contributed to the severity of the accident. Instead, it found the design of the rails themselves did. It is extremely rare, the report said, for displaced sections of any rail to puncture and enter a rail vehicle during an accident, as had happened at Valhalla. During his interview with investigators, Metro-North's power director told them he believed the third rails were designed to break up in accidents and fail to the side, away from the train, since they had done so during the 1984 single-fatality accident at that same crossing. But in this case, with only two exceptions, the third rail's 6-foot (2 m) sections had largely remained joined in larger sections averaging in length, weighing a ton (800 kg) each, as they accumulated in the first and second cars. In those sections, investigators observed fractures in the splice bars and bolts used to hold the sections together, but not the rail sections themselves. They then obtained the rail's design specifications from the manufacturer and, based on Metro-North's own maintenance diagrams of how those rail sections were to be joined, developed a computer simulation using finite element modeling to determine how the rail might react to loads and stresses similar to those it would likely have experienced during the accident, both horizontally and vertically. Those simulations showed that the rail's splice bars would have required high deformation levels before breaking when bent in an upwards direction. They did not experience sufficient stress to break until the rail sections had already entered the car. \\"This accident demonstrated that Metro- North's third rail assembly catastrophically compromised a passenger railcar with fatal consequences,\\" the report concluded. \\"The third rail entering the lead railcar caused significant damage and increased the number and severity of injuries and fatalities.\\" The NTSB recommended that not just Metro-North, but all the nation's passenger rail services that use third-rail systems with grade crossings, undertake a risk assessment of those crossings and take corrective measures, such as joining rails in a manner designed to experience controlled failure during a similar accident. It also recommended that the Federal Transit Administration notify all the other railroads and require them to carry out the risk assessment, as well as the correction of any deficiencies identified. =Fire= The NTSB also looked at how the fire had started and whether anything could have been done to prevent it. Surviving passengers said it began with sparks from the rails as they entered the car; debris from the ML350 and the rail cover, a polymer-based material, ignited along with fuel from the SUV's tank that had gotten on the rail. From these sources many small fires developed, merging to the point that when Smalls was able to get out of the cab after the train stopped, he recalled that the center and rear of the car were already significantly ablaze. Passengers in the center and rear were able to use the emergency exits as intended to escape the car since the rear door was jammed by a section of third rail that had gone through it. The NTSB believed that this had prevented additional deaths and injuries among them. In fact none of the five deaths on the train were a result of the fire; no soot was found in those passengers' airways. Nevertheless, investigators wanted to know whether any of the car's interior finishes, or the materials introduced into the interior by the collision, might have contributed to the fire. Since the first car was so badly damaged, they collected samples of seat covers, wall panels and light lenses from the second car. Upon installation when the car first came into service in 2000, the seat upholstery materials had met FRA flammability standards as required by regulation, but the testing carried out after the accident showed this to be no longer the case. However, the FRA regulations did not require that the materials be reassessed at any point during their service life. =NTSB member statements= Three of the four members of the NTSB filed individual statements to go with the report. Two, acting chairman Robert Sumwalt and T. Bella Dinh-Zarr, concurred with the report's findings; Sumwalt joined Dinh- Zarr's statement. A week after the report was released, a third member, Earl Weener, filed a dissenting statement. Concurrences \\"I suspect some may have had the expectation that the NTSB would be able to explain with certainty why the driver of the SUV ended up on the tracks that fateful evening,\\" Sumwalt began. But with Brody dead, that was impossible. He offered his own explanation: that she \\"simply did not realize she was on or near railroad tracks\\" despite the signs and pavement markings. Those were outweighed, in his opinion, by her unfamiliarity with the neighborhood, the fact that the crossing was unlit beyond the warning lights, and the distraction created by the bumper-to-bumper traffic along the Commerce detour. To the chairman, the strongest evidence for his theory was the way she had calmly left the ML350 to inspect its rear and remove the barrier that had gotten caught on it. \\"Someone in a good state of mind, as this driver apparently was, who is aware that they are in close proximity to a railroad crossing, and in imminent danger of being struck by a train going 60 mph, would not act this way\\", Sumwalt said. He noted that in another grade crossing accident in California shortly after the Vallhalla crash, a driver had turned his pickup truck onto the tracks inadvertently out of confusion created by a nearby intersection. Sumwalt reiterated the report's call for the makers of GPS navigation hardware and software to incorporate the FRA's database of grade crossings into their products so that drivers using them had additional awareness that they were crossing active tracks when they did so. Dinh-Zarr, in her statement, defended the NTSB's work in investigating the accident and its conclusions. Like Sumwalt, she said, Brody's death made it impossible to determine why she drove onto the tracks. So the board thus concluded that had caused the accident after examining every other possible cause and ruling them out when they found regulatory compliance and no deficiencies. The report's recommendations, she concluded, \\"will aid in preventing this type of tragic accident in the future.\\" Dissent The dissenting member, Weener, dismissed speculation as to Brody's motives. \\"It is human nature to put oneself in the place of another, trying to interpret or judge whether actions are reasonable given all the circumstances,\\" he wrote. \\"However, speculation does not serve those affected by this accident or further the investigation.\\" Weener agreed that the evidence suggested Brody had \\"likely lost situational awareness\\" between when she saw the marking signs and when she reached the tracks. But he pointed out that among the unknowns were whether Brody knew the impact to her car was from the descending barrier‚Äîshe could have just as easily thought it could have been Hope's vehicle, he observed, and gone out to check‚Äîand whether she had adequate time and space to back up into the space Hope created. She may well have known she was near the tracks and left the ML350 to see where she was in relation to them, since it had blind spots at the front and rear, Weener added. \\"It is as important or, perhaps more important, to ask how the SUV ended up within the crossing gates\\", Weener also wrote, addressing a number of other issues he felt the board should have considered. Were the federal standards the markings and signs conformed to strong enough? Were drivers adequately educated that the barriers were designed to break if they needed to get out of a crossing in a hurry, or that they should continue forward with greater speed from the crossing in that situation rather than back up, much as they are trained to do when a green light turns yellow as they enter an intersection? \\"I am left unsatisfied as to how the configuration of this angled crossing, the signage approaching the crossing, the deterrent effect of existing New York rail crossing statutes, and the New York State driver education regarding rail crossing safety may have affected these events\\", Weener concluded. \\"I am concerned that the statement of probable cause does not reflect the real causes of this accident.\\" Post-accident official responses Since the accident, the town of Mount Pleasant and the MTA have responded to some of the issues discussed in the NTSB report. =Proposed closure of crossing= While the NTSB investigated and prepared its report, the town conducted a traffic study to determine whether the Commerce Street crossing should be closed, also considering doing the same for the Cleveland Street crossing in downtown Valhalla, just south of the station, reducing the amount of grade crossings along the line to two within two miles (3.2 km) from four, the most of any town in the county. It found that the Commerce Street crossing met many of the Federal Highway Administration's criteria for closure: high passenger train volume and speed, low road traffic volume, multiple tracks, a mere to a traffic signal, a poor approach angle (62¬∫), poor visibility due to the substation, and the two fatal accidents in its history. The town deferred taking action or making the study public until the NTSB released its report on the crash, which recommended closing the crossing. In October 2017 the town made details of the plan public. It would compensate for the loss of westbound traffic at the intersection by changing the timing of the traffic signals on the Taconic, adding a left turn lane at the Lakeview intersection, and restricting truck traffic to local deliveries. A study by the town engineer had estimated that the town could be assessed damages of up to $120 million for the accident despite being able to do little to prevent it, an amount that would have an extreme adverse effect on the town's finances. \\"My position is, when I'm told that something is dangerous and we haven't done anything about it, what is my liability?\\" asked town supervisor Carl Fulgenzi. \\"I'm not putting this town in this kind of liability any further.\\" The $12‚Äì15 million cost would largely be borne by NYSDOT, whom the MTA had already petitioned for the closing. However, residents in the area, particularly those who lived near the crossings, objected vehemently. One woman from Thornwood, a hamlet of Mount Pleasant just north of the accident site, drew applause at a later meeting when she said she had learned how to handle grade crossings during her high school driver's education classes. \\"[Brody] made a tragic error,\\" she said. \\"People died, but you can't close crossings that have been working perfectly fine since I've been in this town for 52 years.\\" Similar objections came from Valhalla residents who would be affected by closing the Cleveland street crossing, noting the lack of any accidents there. Two Valhalla fire commissioners also expressed concern that changes to the local roads would be unable to accommodate large fire trucks. Other residents accused Fulgenzi of being biased in favor of closing Cleveland, since he has advocated doing so for several years, and thus could not keep an \\"open mind\\" when evaluating the plan. \\"I'm only one vote\\" on the town board, he responded. =MTA grade crossing safety campaign= After the accident, the MTA began promoting grade crossing safety through a multimedia campaign. It added to its website a page developed in conjunction with Operation Lifesaver (OLI), an organization that works to promote rail safety among the public, particularly at grade crossings. Informational posters, reminding passengers to \\"Wait Behind the Gate\\" when they drive through grade crossings, went up in trains and at stations on the Metro-North, the LIRR, and the New York City Subway. The campaign was also spread electronically. Video public service announcements ran on screens in larger stations served by MTA trains, including Grand Central Terminal, Penn Station and Fulton Center. They were also run on Facebook and the websites for many newspapers in the New York metropolitan area. Filmed versions ran before movies. According to the NTSB, the MTA reported success in reaching a population with the OLI material that had rarely, if at all, been exposed to it before. alt=A police officer wearing a dark blue uniform faces left, holding a white pamphlet. Behind him a grade crossing gate is down, red lights are on and a train is approaching Enforcement efforts supplemented the education and public outreach. The MTA police worked with local law enforcement to create a Right of Way Task Force. Officers primarily handed out pamphlets to drivers, pedestrians and train passengers at the many grade crossings in the metropolitan area, but also went as far as issuing summonses to violators, even arresting five, by November 2016. In September 2016, it was announced that the Commerce Street crossing, where the accident occurred, would be one of 43 MTA-operated railroad crossings to get closed-circuit television upgrades, paid for by a $1.9 million grant from the FRA. The CCTV installations, part of a wider project by the MTA to improve safety at railroad crossings, would help the MTA \\"investigate specific incidents and analyze crossing/traffic operations for targeted modifications to improve safety.\\" Litigation Three months after the accident, the MTA had received 34 separate notices of claim, the first step toward filing a lawsuit. Most were from passengers injured or killed, including the Brody family, all alleging negligence. The Brodys' attorney alleged that money allocated for a 2009 improvement that would have brought the crossing to federal standards was never spent. The widow of victim Robert Dirks filed a negligence lawsuit naming the town, county and Metro North, as well as Smalls the engineer as defendants, claiming Smalls could have stopped the train earlier. The lawsuit pointed to data from the train's event recorder showing that he had continued blowing the horn for five seconds until he began braking, from the intersection when the train was traveling at . The lawyers speculated that if he had hit the brake immediately perhaps the collision could have been less severe or avoided entirely. Smalls answered that he had been trained to use the horn first if the tracks were blocked at a crossing, and not immediately use the emergency brake until he was sure of what was blocking the tracks since that could cause a derailment and injure any standing passengers in the train. Plaintiffs' lawyers were not deterred by the NTSB's finding that Ellen Brody caused the crash by driving onto the tracks as the train approached, a finding that her husband disagreed with, saying the crossing warnings were dated and could have been upgraded. In 2018 it was disclosed that Smalls had reached a confidential settlement of a legal claim he had made against the MTA; his attorney said the engineer had never returned to work, was no longer employed by Metro-North, and had post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the crash. Attorneys for the surviving passengers and the families of the dead accused the MTA of \\"buy[ing] his silence\\". Around the crash's fourth anniversary, The Journal News reported that lawyers for injured passengers and families of the dead were focusing on the third rail's failure to break up as a contributing cause.

The single \\"Thirty- Nine and Holding\\" would rise to number 6, Lewis's first Top 10 country hit since \\"Middle Age Crazy\\" in 1977 and his last to date. However, it is Lewis's version of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" that is often singled out for praise; although it only reached number 18 on the charts, Lewis altered the spirit of the song much like he had years earlier when he recorded a boogie-woogie version of \\"Me and Bobby McGee,\\" his ravaged voice giving the usually optimistic Judy Garland classic a forlorn vulnerability. \\"It had a certain feeling to it,\\" Lewis told biographer Rick Bragg in 2014, \\"like a religious undertone.

She is best known for her appropriations of Old Master Paintings which combine their historical provenance with contemporary ideas and perspective. Early life and education Gilje was born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. She received her BFA from the City College of New York and trained as a conservator from 1967 to 1971 at the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, Italy. Gilje apprenticed in Rome with the restorer of antique paintings, Antonio deMata, from 1966 to 1968. Gilje continued her apprenticeship from 1968 to 1972 at the Museum of Capodimonte in Naples. Career = Restoration = In 1973, she returned to New York and worked in the conservation studio of Marco Grassi,\\"Artists in Conversation: Kathleen Gilje\\". Bomb Magazine, by Mary Ellen Mark where she restored Old Master paintings\\"Masterpieces, Revised by a Playful Restorer\\". New York Times, June 30, 2013 for private and museum clients, including Stanley Moss, E.V. Thaw, Robert Dance, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Norton Simon Collection in Pasadena, and the Thyssen Bornemizsa Collection. In 1976, she opened her own studio. During this period, she also created artistic works, initially relief sculpture and then painting which was exhibited in various SoHo galleries. Gilje began to combine her knowledge of conservation with her own paintings in the early 1990s.\\"Interview between Kathleen Gilje and Francis Naumann,Revised and Restored: The Art of Kathleen Gilje. Greenwich, CT: Bruce Museum, 2013, pp. 86-89\\"Basquiat Portrait by Kathleen Gilje Reinterprets a Classic\\". Arts Observer. April 18, 2012. = Alternative readings = In her paintings, drawings and installations, Gilje applies an art historical analysis and uses methodologies of conservation to create altered versions of familiar paintings which suggest alternative interpretations of the original artworks. In this way, she encourages her audience to think about a work of art on several levels: its material and historical narrative. An example of this is Rembrandt's Dana√´' defaced by a vandal with acid in the Hermitage, its contemporary symbolism translated into up-to-date equivalents; another is Caravaggio's Boy Bitten by a Lizard, Restored, 1992, where the lizard is replaced by a syringe, suggesting a link to the risk of AIDS. Many of her paintings engage with feminist issues, although they are sometimes controversial (as in her series of \\"Sargent's Women,\\" portraying 48 women visually excised from paintings by John Singer Sargent, all rendered without their luxurious clothing).\\"BREAST MILK\\". Artnet, by Charlie FinchJohnson, Ken, Kathleen Gilje\\" (review), The New York Times, 14 Sept 2001, Arts and Leisure section, p. 26. In Susanna and the Elders, Restored, 1998, Gilje exhibits a recreation of Artemisia Gentileschi's Susanna and the Elders (a story of sexual abuse) hanging next to an x-ray of the painting. When Gilje recreated Gentileschi's painting, she made an underpainting in lead white (lead white x-rays well) of Gentileschi's own rape by Agostino Tassi. In the x-ray we see Gentileschi's arm extended holding a knife in self-defense and her face contorted and screaming. The image can faintly be seen in the pentimento as well. Her references are provocative as she addresses timely social, political and personal concerns. = Portraits = Gilje created a number of portraits in which her subjects were placed in the context of an historic painting of their choice; these were displayed in her exhibition Curators and Connoisseur at Francis M. Naumann Fine Art, New York, in 2006. For example, art historian Linda Nochlin chose √âdouard Manet's 1882 Bar at the Folies Berg√®re for Gilje's Linda Nochlin at the Bar at the Folies Bergere, 2006, and art historian Robert Rosenblum chose Ingres‚Äô 1823/26 Comte de Pastoret for his Gilje portrait of 2005. Exhibitions and recognition Over the course of the past twenty years, her work has been shown in various exhibitions throughout the United States and in Europe. Several critics and art historians have written about her work, including Robert Rosenblum, Linda NochlinLinda Nochlin, \\"Seeing Beneath the Surface,\\" Art in America, March 2002; pp. 119-121. and John Yau.John Yau, Revised and Restored: The Art of Kathleen Gilje, Greenwich: Bruce Museum, 2013, p 61.

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built from to 1928. It was also known as the Irish Club, which owned and operated the building from 1919 to 2015. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. It has now been converted to a cinema complex by the Sourris brothers retaining many of the original historical aspects of the building and its long history as the Brisbane Irish Club. The building is now known as The Elizabeth Picture Theatre.  History  The land at the site was bought by James Hunter, a boot manufacturer, in 1877 for ¬£2250. Soon afterwards, Richard Gailey, architect, called for tenders for the construction of two Elizabeth Street stores for James Hunter. By 1879 Hunter was advertising his warehouses to let at ¬£200 per annum. Hunter's investment in this property was part of a more general, growing interest in this warehousing quarter. Messrs Unmack & Heussler, produce merchants, politicians and prominent citizens, conducted their business at the building from 1879 to 1884. From 1884 to 1899, the building was owned by the wealthy London merchant Alexander McArthur and used as the Brisbane branch of his extensive warehousing firm. The new owner in 1899 was James Cowlishaw, architect, newspaper proprietor, company director and politician. During Cowlishaw's time various importers, warehousing firms and manufacturers agents were tenants. Cowlishaw financed the Queensland Irish Association's (QIA) purchase of the building in 1919 by a mortgage of ¬£8000 (purchase price was ¬£11,000). The building was in the hands of the QIA continuously since that time until 2015 when the QIA went into liquidation and the building was sold to a private investor. The earlier success of the QIA reflects the significance of Queensland's Irish population from the start of free settlement. In the 1860s, 18% of the Queensland population was Irish-born. Tara House has undergone regular alterations and maintenance to the interior ‚Äî mostly provision of services and fittings but major structural and interior work was carried out on the building in 1927-28 ‚Äî a joint project of the well- known architectural firm Cavanagh and Cavanagh and R Coutts & Son. The internal alterations were designed to highlight the Irish association with the building, an association which has extended over more than seventy years. The building was named Tara House in an official ceremony on 28 June 1948. In February 2015, the club entered voluntary administration as the club's debt levels continued to rise following a $3 million loan for extensive renovations to attract new younger members. The club continued to operate at Tara House until May 2015 when the club was unable to pay its debts and entered liquidation. In June 2015, Tara House was offered for sale so the Irish Club could pay its creditors. In November 2015 it was sold for $8.1 million to a local private investor. On 16 December 2015 it was announced that the Queensland Irish Association was unable to secure a lease within Tara House due to higher offers being given by commercial operators. In September 2016, a development application was prepared to convert Tara House into a cinema by James Peter Sourris, Stephen James Sourris and Peter James Sourris, who previously converted the also heritage-listed Village Twin Cinemas in New Farm. The development application was approved in February 2017.  Description  Arched ceiling in the Tara Ball Room, 2015 Tara House is situated in a section of Elizabeth Street previously used as a warehousing precinct. It is located close to other remnants of the warehouse era, notably the adjacent Heckelmanns Building and the present Kings Car Park. Current use of the area is for shops and offices. Tara House is a two-storey, cement- rendered brick building with basement of the late 1870s, with simple classical detailing, including an arcaded upper level crowned by an entablature and balustraded parapet. The arcade is composed of two symmetrical sections on either side of a central pilaster. Each section contains five semi-circular arched openings, the central one of which is flanked by pilasters and topped, above the parapet, by a triangular pediment. The central pilaster and the pilasters at either end of the facade are each crowned by an urn above the parapet. Lead light panels depicting the four counties of Ireland and the Queensland coat of arms, 2015 Extensive alterations to the building in 1927-28 saw the demolition of the original back wall and the addition of a reinforced concrete and steel extension. At the same time the interior of the first floor was remodelled. A panelled, arched ceiling to the rear half of this floor is decorated in modelled fibrous plaster with angels, harps and Australian floral motifs in gold relief. The walls are panelled in silky oak; the floor is hardwood. Lead light panels in the ceiling and one end wall depict the four counties of Ireland and the Queensland coat of arms, while other leadlight windows are located in the north- east side wall. The original ground floor facade and interior finishes have been removed. The upper floor interior finishes of the 1927-28 alterations are intact despite the intrusion of a bar and kitchen and some suspended ceilings. The basement has been extensively refurbished.  Heritage listing  Tara House (Irish Club) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Tara House is significant for its architectural quality, in particular the fine design, detailing, materials and workmanship of the interior, which were part of the 1927-28 renovations.

High availability is a high percentage of time that the system is functioning. It can be formally defined as (1 ‚Äì (down time/ total time))*100%. Although the minimum required availability varies by task, systems typically attempt to achieve 99.999% (5-nines) availability. This characteristic is weaker than fault tolerance, which typically seeks to provide 100% availability, albeit with significant price and performance penalties. High availability software is measured by its performance when a subsystem fails, its ability to resume service in a state close to the state of the system at the time of the original failure, and its ability to perform other service-affecting tasks (such as software upgrade or configuration changes) in a manner that eliminates or minimizes down time. All faults that affect availability ‚Äì hardware, software, and configuration need to be addressed by High Availability Software to maximize availability. Features Typical high availability software provides features that: Enable hardware and software redundancy: These features include: # The discovery of hardware and software entities, # The assignment of active/standby roles to these entities, # Detection of failed components, # Notification to redundant components that they should become active, and # The ability to scale the system. A service is not available if it cannot service all the requests being placed on it. The ‚Äúscale-out‚Äù property of a system refers to the ability to create multiple copies of a subsystem to address increasing demand, and to efficiently distribute incoming work to these copies (Load balancing (computing)) preferably without shutting down the system. High availability software should enable scale-out without interrupting service. Enable active/standby communication (notably Checkpointing): Active subsystems need to communicate to standby subsystems to ensure that the standby is ready to take over where the active left off. High Availability Software can provide communications abstractions like redundant message and event queues to help active subsystems in this task. Additionally, an important concept called ‚Äúcheckpointing‚Äù is exclusive to highly available software. In a checkpointed system, the active subsystem identifies all of its critical state and periodically updates the standby with any changes to this state. This idea is commonly abstracted as a distributed hash table ‚Äì the active writes key/value records into the table and both the active and standby subsystems read from it. Unlike a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù distributed hash table (Chord (peer-to-peer), Kademlia, etc.) a checkpoint is fully replicated. That is, all records in the ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù hash table are readable so long as one copy is running. Another technique, called an [application checkpoint], periodically saves the entire state of a program. Enable in-service upgrades: In Service Software Upgrade is the ability to upgrade software without degrading service. It is typically implemented in redundant systems by executing what is called a ‚Äúrolling‚Äù upgrade‚Äîupgrading the standby while the active provides service, failing over, and then upgrading the old active. Another important feature is the ability to rapidly fall back to an older version of the software and configuration if the new version fails. Minimize standby latency and ensure standby correctness: Standby latency is defined as the time between when a standby is told to become active and when it is actually providing service. ‚ÄúHot‚Äù standby systems are those that actively update internal state in response to active system checkpoints, resulting in millisecond down times. ‚ÄúCold‚Äù standby systems are offline until the active fails and typically restart from a ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù state. For example, many cloud solutions will restart a virtual machine on another physical machine if the underlying physical machine fails. ‚ÄúCold‚Äù fail over standby latency can range from 30+ seconds to several minutes. Finally, ‚Äúwarm‚Äù standby is an informal term encompassing all systems that are running yet must do some internal processing before becoming active. For example, a warm standby system might be handling low priority jobs ‚Äì when the active fails it aborts these jobs and reads the active's checkpointed state before resuming service. Warm standby latencies depend on how much data is checkpointed but typically have a few seconds latency. System architecture High availability software can help engineers create complex system architectures that are designed to minimize the scope of failures and to handle specific failure modes. A ‚Äúnormal‚Äù failure is defined as one which can be handled by the software architecture's, while a ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù failure is defined as one which is not handled. A catastrophic failure therefore causes a service outage. However, the software can still greatly increase availability by automatically returning to an in-service state as soon as the catastrophic failure is remedied. The simplest configuration (or ‚Äúredundancy model‚Äù) is 1 active, 1 standby, or 1+1. Another common configuration is N+1 (N active, 1 standby), which reduces total system cost by having fewer standby subsystems. Some systems use an all-active model, which has the advantage that ‚Äústandby‚Äù subsystems are being constantly validated. High Availability Software Example System Architecture Configurations can also be defined with active, hot standby, and cold standby (or idle) subsystems, extending the traditional ‚Äúactive+standby‚Äù nomenclature to ‚Äúactive+standby+idle‚Äù (e.g. 5+1+1). Typically, ‚Äúcold standby‚Äù or ‚Äúidle‚Äù subsystems are active for lower priority work. Sometimes these systems are located far away from their redundant pair in a strategy called geographic redundancy. This architecture seeks to avoid loss of service from physically-local events (fire, flood, earthquake) by separating redundant machines. Sophisticated policies can be specified by high availability software to differentiate software from hardware faults, and to attempt time-delayed restarts of individual software processes, entire software stacks, or entire systems. Use in industry In the past 20 years telecommunication networks and other complex software systems have become essential parts of business and recreational activities. > ‚ÄúAt the same time [as the economy is in a downturn], 60% almost -- that's > six out of 10 businesses -- require 99.999.

Defense/Military: Recently High Availability Software has found its way into defense projects as an inexpensive way to provide availability for manned and unmanned vehicles Space: High Availability Software is proposed for use of non-radiation hardened equipment in space environments. Radiation hardened electronics is significantly more expensive and lower performance than off-the-shelf equipment. But High Availability Software running on a single or pair of rad- hardened controllers can manage many redundant high performance non-rad-hard computers, potentially failing over and resetting them in the event of a fault. Use in the cloud Typical cloud services provide a set of networked computers (typical a virtual machine) running a standard server OS like Linux. Computers can often communicate with other instances within the same data center for free (tenant network) and to outside computers for fee. The cloud infrastructure may provide simple fault detection and restart at the virtual machine level. However, restarts can take several minutes resulting in lower availability. Additionally, cloud services cannot detect software failures within the virtual machines. High Availability Software running inside the cloud virtual machines can detect software (and virtual machine) failures in seconds and can use checkpointing to ensure that standby virtual machines are ready to take over service.

Isabell Kristensen store, 33 Beauchamp Place, London (2016) History IC Group was founded as IC Companys in 2001 through the merger of InWear Group A/S and Carli Gry International A/S. InWear had been founded by Niels Martinsen in 1973. Carly Gry traced its history back to 1940 when J√∏rgen and Carli Gry opened a small shop in Copenhagen. In 1973, the company launched the clothing brand Jackpot. In 2002, IC Group acquired the brand Saint Tropez and launched the brands O by Isabell Kristensen (since 2006: Soaked in Luxury) and Designers Remix Collection. In 2003, the company acquired the brand Tiger of Sweden and launched the brand By Malene Birger as a joint-venture with the designer Malene Birger. In 2013, IC Group sold its two brands Jackpot and Cottonfield to Coop Danmark. InWear, Matinique, Part Two and Soaked in Luxury were sold in 2014. The company subsequently changed its name to IC Group. In June 2018, Peak Performance was sold to Amer Sports Corporation In January 2019, the IC Group announced it will be selling its Saint Tropez fashion brand to DK Company. In May 2019, it was announced that Friheden Invest A/S, IC's main shareholder, had decided to submit an offer to purchase all company shares and therefore to take the company private. This decision comes shortly after another IC investor, Nordea Funds Ltd, cut its holding to zero. In June 2019, the IC Group announced it will be initiating organizational changes and store closures at their Tiger of Sweden brand. The company noted that these cost-cutting measures will lead to non-recurring costs of 10 million Danish crone for the 2018/19 financial year.

It is placed in the aneurysm's parent artery, covering the neck, in order to divert blood flow and determine a progressive thrombosis of the sac. Flow diverting stents consist of structural Cobalt-chrome or Nitinol alloy wires and often a set of radiopaque wires woven together in a flexible braid. Medical usage Flow diverters are treatment for intracranial aneurysms alternative to endosaccular coil embolization (although the techniques can be combined, especially in large/giant aneurysms). It is mainly effective in wide neck unerupted saccular aneurysms, that are difficult to coil because of the tendency of the coils to fill the parent artery (referred to as prolapse). Another situation is fusiform shape or circumferential aneurysms. Prior to flow diverters many intracranial aneurysms went untreated. Risks and complications The efficacy of flow diverters can be evaluated using a grading system developed by researchers at Oxford Neurovascular and Neuroradiology Research Unit (Kamran et al. 2011), commonly referred to as flow diverter grading system or Kamran grading system. After receiving a cerebral flow diverter, patients are placed on dual antiplatelet therapy for an extended period of time to reduce the likelihood of peri-procedural and post-procedural thromboembolic complications. The degree of aneurysm occlusion is graded on a five-point scale from 0 (no change in the endoaneurysmal flow) to 4 (complete obliteration of the aneurysm). The patency status of the parent artery is evaluated on a three-point scale, from no change in the parent artery diameter to parent artery occlusion. This grading system is used in clinical practice. It has also been used and adapted by researchers to evaluate and report the effectiveness of flow diverters in general.

It dynamically responds to trigger inputs from MIDI and/or audio signals. With a response time of 0.1 milliseconds, the F16 is the fastest audio triggering digital sampler ever sold. It was manufactured by Forat Music and Electronics, introduced in 1987 at a list price of $5200 and was discontinued in 1994. An optional Remote Control and SCSI capability was available for $1385. Features The F16 Digital Sampler is a high-quality rack mount audio sampling and storage device designed to reproduce 16-bit sounds in response to MIDI or audio trigger inputs. Samples are recorded in full 16-bit linear format with 96 dB of dynamic range and superb signal to noise ratios. The unit consists of eight voice modules. Each module is capable of storing a sample up to 26 seconds. The combined total maximum sampling time with eight modules is three minutes and thirty seconds. Sample rates range from 10 kHz to 60 kHz. High fidelity is achieved at 35 kHz and above, resulting in full bandwidth sounds of over seven seconds per voice module; one minute for all eight modules. In addition to recording individual samples, the modules may be \\"chained\\" to form one recording almost seven minutes long. Editing commands allow you to trim and move samples. Each voice module has its own volume, pan and pitch controls and an activity light which indicates when the module is playing. Voices are available as discrete outputs, or in a composite stereo mix. The mix output only contains voices not extracted using the discrete outputs. The discrete outputs may also be used as an effects send and return to add reverb or other processing to individual voices prior to the stereo mix. Each module has a dynamic velocity sensitive trigger input. The trigger response time is 0.1 milliseconds, providing an amazing range of sensitivity with absolute repeatability. The trigger inputs accommodate virtually all dynamic sensitive pads, drum machines, sequencer trigger outputs, plus audio from tape machines and other audio sources. An optional Hi-Hat Module provides variable hi-hat decay controlled via MIDI or a foot pedal. This feature is similar to the programmable hi-hat decay on the Linn 9000 drum machine. Sounds are saved to or loaded from an optional internal SCSI Zip drive, an external SCSI hard drive or a fast 600 RPM floppy drive. MIDI In, Out, and Thru are supplied with full dynamic velocity sensitivity. Each module may be assigned to any MIDI note number and independent channel, and several modules may have the same note number and channel, if desired. MIDI note and channel settings are preserved when the F16 is turned off or unplugged. The F16 features mic and line level inputs for sampling and a headphone jack. A Remote Control plus SCSI capability was sold separately. 16-bit samples were sold separately.

NJRS aims to be a comprehensive repository of all Appeals and Judgments related to Direct Taxes in India. The Income Tax Department is the largest litigant in India and NJRS will help the department in decongesting and streamlining the huge backlog of litigation in various courts and Tribunals related to direct tax cases. The portal was launched in March 2015. Continuous improvements and public access are in progress. The portal will enable the department to monitor appeals progress through the appeal stages, undertake policy analysis for issues leading to rising litigation and do research for strengthening their cases by taking reference from previous orders made by the courts tax appeals.Finance ministry launches ambitious national electronic I-T judicial database Background  The Income Tax Department (ITD) is responsible for collecting Direct Taxes and administering the Income Tax Law and other direct tax statutes for Government of India. The department has offices in 510 cities and towns across India. There are 3420 assessment units in the department and a sanctioned strength of about 8600 at the level of ITOs and above. These are to increase to about 4500 and 11600 respectively as a result of the recently approved restructuring in the department. Tax litigation is an integral component of any modern tax administration. It not only helps resolve disputes between the tax payers and the tax administration, it also helps in the interpretation of tax issues and in planning transactions. The Indian Tax laws also provide an elaborate mechanism for resolution of tax disputes - both administrative involving the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and various Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms, as well as, through the appeal jurisdictions of the Income Tax Apellate Tribuna l, High Courts and the Supreme Court of India. However, increasing volumes of litigation in various tribunals and courts, the long time taken for finalization of a tax dispute and varied interpretations of tax law taken by both tax officials and various judicial fora has become a cause of concern. The CAG, in its Performance Audit Report No. - 20 of 2009-10, states that the dimensions of disputes in income tax are staggering and that it takes a long time to settle tax disputes. The report also states that the Income Tax Department lacks credible and reliable data on the volume and impact of appeals which points to weak internal controls. Inadequate internal control in turn lead to time barring of appeals and delays in implementation of appellate orders. The CAG report recommended automation of receipt and disposal of appellate orders. Besides maintenance of proper litigation database, there is also a need to continuously identify contentious legal issues, analyse them and take corrective action to clarify the law. An Office Memorandum of the Central Board of Direct Taxes states that a large part of litigation in the Direct Taxes matters involves interpretation of legal provisions. Inconsistent approach on contentious legal issues by officers of the department gives rise to further litigation. There have also been suggestions to identify and flag areas through the departments website where there are issues relating to interpretation of the tax law, so as to give taxpayers an insight into existing areas of litigation so they can avoid, as far as possible, taking litigation prone positions in their tax returns. The NJRS project was taken up by the Income Tax Department to create an electronic platform as a replacement for the manual method of managing litigation. NJRS will have two components: * Appeals Repository & Management System - an electronic database all pending appeals at Income Tax Appellate Tribunal(ITAT), High Courts (HCs) and Supreme Court of India (SC). * Judicial Research & Reference System - an electronic database of all orders/judgments of ITAT, Authority of Advance Ruling, HCs and SC. Both databases will be cross referenced, have suitable metadata & key-phrases and have enterprise class search engine to be enable identification of disputed issues across cases for improved decision making. Objective The project for setting up a National Judicial Reference System (NJRS) and the project for setting up an Institutional Mechanism for formulating a 'Departmental View' on contentious legal issues are the two key measures being taken up by the Central Board of Direct Taxes to streamline the litigation management system in the department. NJRS is proposed to be a comprehensive electronic database of all appeals and judgments in Direct Tax cases pending before various judicial authorities i.e. Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, High Courts and the Supreme Court of India. It will also bring automation in the work-flows of the Judicial wings of the department. Such a system will help link the units engaged in litigation work in the department and in tracking tax appeals on a 24X7 basis. It is also expected to act as a knowledge repository that will assist officials in issuing consistent orders utilising the judicial information available in it online. The NJRS has facility to club similar cases, weed out weak ones and help make a stronger argument before various tribunals and courts. NJRS will facilitate Computer-assisted legal research and provide easy accessibility to judicial information, case laws and judgments, thereby enabling the tax officers to take a more informed and consistent approach in tax audits. It will also assist the Department's Representatives/Counsels in improving the quality of representation before Tribunal & Courts and enhancing the success rate of the department in appeals. The National Judicial Reference System (NJRS) is thus envisaged as a tool for effective tracking and monitoring of Appeals at various stages, reduce disputed tax demand by targeting high demand cases, a comprehensive reference system and a decision support system to achieve efficiency in the tax litigation process of Income Tax Department (ITD), Government of India. Implementation Approach The project is being implemented through an Implementation Agency engaged through an open competitive bid process in April, 2014. The Implementation Agency is a consortium of a Systems Integrator - NSDL eGovernace Infrastructure Ltd and a company specializing in legal databases - Skorydov Systems Pvt Ltd. The project is being implemented on a Public Private Partnership (PPP)model, where the technology risk has been passed on to the IA. The IA has the flexibility to generate additional revenues (besides the project payments from the government) by utilizing the judicial database for commercial purposes subject to certain restrictions. The project leverages upon the advancements in computerisation of the registry functions of the Tribunals and Courts achieved under the e-Courts Mission Mode Project taken up under the National e-Governance Plan(NeGP). As the case filing, scrutiny and case registration services have been automated in the courts, the NJRS project envisages collation of data from such external data sources. The Income Tax Department in India has also developed several computer systems to for its own internal workflows and to manage the data base of the returns filed by the tax payers. The unifying factor across these computer systems is the Permanent Account Number (PAN) allocated to identify each tax payer uniquely. The data collected in from the external court systems will be collated in NJRS with the help of taxpayers information stored in the PAN database and other computer systems of the tax department. In addition, the appeal case files will also be scanned through a network of 28 regional scanning centers specially established under the project across the country. The scanned case files will be processed at a BPO like facility for writing case summaries, keyphrases, metadata and linking the case files with the case data obtained from external court systems. Creation of NJRS will thus be a mammoth exercise, requiring the active co- operation of a number of agencies, including the judicial bodies. Logo thumbnail The NJRS logo has been conceived with a view to create a visual perception of Knowledge, Transparency and Reliability. The bold, clean font and the choice of a flat colour scheme using red and black colours create this presence. The red dot is a specific choice in the design language. As the system is a data recording repository of appeals and judgments, the red dot is a visual cue for the \\"recording\\" or assimilation of knowledge. This creates an association with audio visual devices which have a similar red icon for recording information. Finally, black and white colours also represent clarity and eliminate ambiguity, further emphasizing the transparency that this system holds.  NJRS Citation  The Citation nomenclature followed within NJRS Case citation#India helps identify any judgment / order uniquely. e.g. * Chandra Ranganathan & Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax 2009-LL-1021, which refers to NJRS citations. This Citation further allows to add the Authority / Court name after the citation. This does not form an integral part of Citation but can be used to enhance the value of the Citation. e.g. * Chandra Ranganathan & Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax 2009-LL-1021-SC, which refers to NJRS citations with additional Court Name. Here, in this case - SC stands for Supreme Court.

Troops from the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Pathet Lao attacked Hmong recruits being trained as Auto Defense Choc guerrillas via Operation Momentum. Although the Hmong made the tactical error of defending a fixed position, their eventual escape from the communist invaders left their fledgling L'Armee Clandestine intact and able to wage war for the Royal Lao Government. However, they abandoned four howitzers and two mortars to the victorious Vietnamese communists. The partisans had also set a deleterious precedent for themselves with their defense of a fixed position.  Background  As the First Indochina War ended, and the Kingdom of Laos moved towards independence, the departing French bureaucrats and soldiers were gradually replaced by Americans.Castle, pp. 9-12. Captain Kong Le, who was opposed to foreign involvement in his nation's affairs, staged a coup d'etat on 9 August 1960.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 32‚Äì33. A counter-coup by General Phoumi Nosavan would eclipse him on 16 December 1960 at the Battle of Vientiane. In the wake of Phoumi's ascension, James William Lair of the Central Intelligence Agency secretly entered Laos. On 9 January 1961, Lair helicoptered out to Ta Vieng on the Plain of Jars to meet a young Hmong lieutenant colonel of the Royal Lao Army named Vang Pao. A Thai officer with Lair arranged a later meeting. On 11 January, Vang Pao told Lair, \\"Either we fight or we leave. If you give me weapons, we fight,\\" When asked how many troops he could raise, he asked for equipment to begin training 10,000 recruits.Warner, pp. 26‚Äì29, 33‚Äì34, 45.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 61‚Äì66. Lair knew that his superiors felt that the hostilities in Laos could be settled only one of two ways: either direct military intervention with American troops, or a surrender of Laos to communism.Warner, p. 46. With this in mind, Lair took the offer back to his superior, Desmond Fitzgerald, with the observation that Vang Pao already had gathered 4,300 potential Hmong recruits. Lair's expressed opinion was that the Hmong were the only potential fighting force between the North Vietnamese invasion and Vientiane. He believed the Hmong would defend their way of life with ongoing guerrilla raids that would tie the Vietnamese down. Moreover, a functional guerrilla force would be best instructed by Thai PARU because they shared a commonly intelligible language. The absence of Caucasian faces in the operation would guarantee plausible deniability for the covert operation. The only caveat in Lair's expertise was that the Hmong could never fight for fixed positions as infantry would; they would always need a line of retreat.Warner, pp. 45‚Äì47. The proposition was approved; Lair was placed in charge, with funding coming direct from the office of the Director of Central Intelligence.Warner, p. 48. Fitzgerald arranged for the first class of Hmong basic training. Dubbed Project Momentum, it supplied the military gear necessary for equipping 2,000 soldiers as an experiment. As the Programs Evaluation Office was already in place in the U.S. Embassy, it was tasked with furnishing the needed equipment from Department of Defense stores. Trainers came from Lair's PARU cadre. The new troops became members of 100-man irregular units called Auto Defense Choc (roughly, Self Defense Shock (troops)).  Operation Momentum begins  The village of Ban Pa Dong was selected as the base for covert training of Hmong guerrillas for several reasons. Most pressing, it was out of reach of enemy action--barely. The Royal Lao Army (RLA) had just abandoned the Routes 7 and 13 intersection at nearby Sala Phou Khoun. Captain Kong Le's newly formed Forces Arm√©es Neutralistes (Neutral Armed Forces)(FAN) was establishing a presence eastward across the Plain of Jars. The Pathet Lao were intent on cooperation with FAN. There was a very real risk attached to failure of Operation Momentum--attraction of communist retribution upon the Hmong populace.Ahern, p. 34. There was a grass airstrip at Ban Pa Dong, and some old wooden buildings that had been built by the French. It was sited on a ridgeline, at elevation, about south of the Plain of Jars.Ahern, p. 36. The altitude would prove problematic for air operations, as an early helicopter crash showed. Flying in to begin the first Operation Momentum instruction cycle, the Air America H-34 carrying Lair ran out of lift to clear a ridge-line. After clipping trees, the helicopter tumbled down a hillside; there were no serious casualties except the demolished helicopter.Ahern, pp. 34‚Äì36. The village had a deep emotional resonance with the Hmong, who traditionally traded their cash crop of opium there. It reputedly reminded them of a glorious past in which Hmong were literate urbanites. Vang Pao's call for recruits rallied entire Hmong villages to Padong so the eligible males could undergo guerrilla training. A common attitude among the recruits was, \\"Just once in my life I want to kill a Vietnamese. Then I can die happy.\\"Warner, pp. 64‚Äì65. The original basis of Momentum was the use of a three-day threshold of opportunity to train Hmong guerrillas before the PAVN could attack from the Plain of Jars. The Hmong were trained in classic hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, with no intent of having the nomadic warriors settle in to defend territory. Their opponent, the PAVN, was a highly trained force, with its infantry reinforced by artillery. It seemed they would be unstoppable if they attacked.Anthony, Morrison, p. 53. However, it was a battalion-size contingent of Pathet Lao who made the first move; the week after Momentum training began, they penetrated within meters of the training site. By 31 January, early graduates of the ADC program had patrolled into enemy territory, killing a dozen Pathet Lao and bringing back eight captured weapons.Ahern, p. 44. When PAVN did make their move, they brought artillery. They had to cross one intermediate ridge as they moved southward from the Plain; Padong was on the next ridge. Initially, the Hmong held that intermediate ridge against PAVN assaults. PAVN artillery began to shell the Hmong. Return fire from a single 4.2 inch mortar that had been flown in to reinforce the Hmong was insufficient. U.S. Army Captain William Chance, who had accompanied the mortar, advised Vang Pao to abandon the position. The head of the Programs Evaluation Office, General Andrew Boyle, also believed Ban Pa Dong should not be held. In response, Vang Pao had some Hmong dependents hike two days south to safer ground at Pha Khao.Warner pp. 66‚Äì67. On 3 May 1961, a truce settled over all of Laos except for Ban Pa Dong. Shelling continued there. Ten days later, in a demonstration of their relentless tactics versus fixed positions, the PAVN overran and wiped out the Royalists at Muong Ngat some east of the Momentum site. Two days later, on 15 May, the PAVN took heavy losses while capturing the intermediate ridge shielding Ban Pa Dong. That same day, Vang Pao estimated 100 artillery shells hit Ban Pa Dong. The PAVN built roads for forward movement of their artillery, and sited it in the lee of the ridge, protected from the Hmong mortar.Warner, p. 67. On 26 and 27 May, Ban Pa Dong took almost 400 rounds of incoming fire. There were 17 75mm cannons firing at the guerrilla base.Castle, p. 156. An attempt was made to set up an overwatch position over Ban Pa Dong on the summit that overshadowed it. However, lack of water foiled the trial. The later discovery of a field phone line on the peak indicated enemy presence. In another approach to a heartier defense, 225 reinforcements were flown in. The Royal Lao Air Force flew 113 hours in support missions with their T-6 Texans in their fledgling combat efforts. However, as they were both inexperienced and armed with only guns and rockets, they were ineffectual.Anthony, Sexton, p. 56. As local tribes burned off undergrowth to clear fields for their slash-and-burn agriculture, visibility worsened, hampering aerial support for the Hmong. On 31 May, an incoming Air America H-34 helicopter crashed, killing all hands. The superstitious Hmong saw the fatal accident as the latest instance of bad luck. Small packets of ADC troopers began to trickle away from Ban Pa Dong.Warner, p. 68.  Fall of Ban Pa Dong  Dense fog settled about Ban Pa Dong on 3 June, and clung on for three days. Under this cover, enemy infantry infiltrated past Hmong outposts. On 6 June, accurate artillery fire kept the guerrillas crouched in fighting positions. Ahern, p. 85. There are two slightly differing accounts of the end of the battle, but both agree a radio intercept sparked it. According to one version, the forwarded radio intercept came in at 15:00 hours, warning of an imminent assault on a company posted about south of the Lima 5 airstrip. With the field phone line to that position severed by artillery, a company of Royalist regulars were sent to both warn and reinforce the southern position. Once the regulars were out of view, they fled. The unwarned guerrilla company suffered about ten dead and 15 wounded during the surprise attack, and withdrew to the main force. Another, more dramatic version, said CIA agent Jack Shirley was passed information from an intercepted PAVN radio message that the PAVN assault was due in ten minutes, at 16:00 hours. In either case, an immediate evacuation began. Shirley, Chance and his U.S. Special Forces Team, and the PARU cadre hurriedly destroyed any military gear too heavy to carry, and herded the Hmong away from the flaming village.Warner, p. 69. Carrying their wounded, with the Americans and the PARUs as a rear guard and heavy small arms fire popping overhead, 400 to 500 Hmong of all ages and both genders began a dispersal into the gloom. At midnight, attracted by flashlights used by some of the Hmong, the PAVN mortared the escaping column. Fortunately for the Hmong, the muddy earth absorbed most of the explosives' force. At daybreak, Air America H-34s showed up to evacuate the PARU, Shirley, and Vang Pao's wife. The Hmong may have lost Ban Pa Dong, but they had not suffered overwhelming casualties in the process. Vang Pao subsequently shifted his headquarters to Long Tieng,Anthony, Sexton, p. 54. which would remain the guerrilla headquarters until war's end.Castle, p. 42.  Aftermath  Losing Ban Pa Dong was a serious defeat for the Hmong guerrillas. They left so hastily that they did not disable their four howitzers and two mortars, but left them usable for the communist victors. The guerrillas had also suffered a substantial number of casualties.Ahern, p. 86. The results of this first defense of a fixed position did not deter Vang Pao from repeating this error in future years, as at the battle of Na Khang.Warner, p. 210. Nevertheless, Ban Pa Dong had served an important purpose; the first 5,000 ADC troopers trained there were the basis of Vang Pao's L'Armee Clandestine. They had ringed the Plain of Jars with guerrilla bases before Ban Pa Dong was overrun.Castle, p. 40. In April 1963, the Hmong would recapture Ban Pa Dong.Ahern, p. 153. It would serve as a defensive base throughout the remainder of the Laotian Civil War.Ahern, pp. 401, 449, 451, 470.  Endnotes   References  * Ahern, Thomas L.

Born in Washington, D.C., her career took her through all the acting mediums of the 20th century. She appeared in over 500 films and television shows. She worked into her 80s, finally retiring shortly before her death in 1974 in Los Angeles. Early life and career Sessions was born into a very well-known family in Washington D.C. on September 16, 1888. A debutante, she followed her coming out party with her introduction into the acting profession, appearing in a 1909 performance of the comic operetta The Sultan of Sulu by George Ade and Nathaniel D. Mann. Her early career was spent performing in cabarets before she moved to New York City, where she began performing on the stage and on Bob Hope's radio show. During the 1930s she appeared in many stage productions, including several Broadway productions. Film and television While appearing on the stage in New York during the 1930s, Sessions made her film debut in Edward Sloman's 1932 film Wayward. While this marked her debut in films, it was not the true beginning to her career in film. Wayward was filmed in New York at the Paramount Publix studios.

He revealed from his dreams the coming of a pale race of people in many years after his death that would lead to the downfall of his kingdom. King Yuhi III commissioned a construction of a three storeyed house made of tree trunks,reeds and grass straws at a place known as Kamonyi. It is thought to have been the first storeyed house ever built in Rwanda.

The book is an account from the point of view of the compound's defenders and does not address any of the political controversy surrounding the attacks. Reception Karen DeYoung of the Washington Post stated, \\"Like other recent bestsellers of the Special Operations genre ‚Äî ‚ÄúLone Survivor,‚Äù about a Navy SEAL mission in Afghanistan, or ‚ÄúNo Easy Day,‚Äù about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden ‚Äî ‚Äú13 Hours‚Äù is an action story that does not dwell on matters of U.S. foreign or security policy, or even the specific cauldron of Libya. It provides little that is new for those still stoking the Benghazi controversy and no real answers to whatever mystery may remain.\\" Roman Augustoviz of Star Tribune wrote, \\"\\"13 Hours\\" is a jarring narrative at times, but well-flowing. It dwells mostly on the six security operators, who they were, how they prepared for their jobs and how they reacted in a crisis and depended on one another.\\" Boston Globe's Glenn C.

The initiative promotes integration of conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity in production landscapes, outside of protected areas. The initiative has been supported and implemented by an international partnership of over 100 governments, civil society organizations, and indigenous peoples. Name The name \\"Satoyama\\" comes from a Japanese term for landscapes that include both human production activities, such as agriculture, forestry and Animal husbandry, and natural habitats, where human influence is an essential aspect of the local ecosystem. The Satoyama Initiative is based on the principle that such landscapes, when properly managed, can benefit both biodiversity and human livelihoods, rather than these being in a state of opposition, thus leading to \\"society in harmony with nature\\". It is important to note that the \\"satoyama\\" landscape per se is limited to a model landscape found in Japan, while landscapes with similar features are found in countries around the world. To avoid referring to landscapes around the world by an inappropriate Japanese term, documentation used in the context of the Satoyama Initiative uses the term \\"socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes (SEPLS)\\" to refer to all such landscapes, including Japanese satoyama.http://satoyama- initiative.org/en/about/ History Some resistance came from some who opposed the use of the word \\"Satoyama\\" since it is only used in Japanese and is not a common term throughout the world, and from some major agricultural exporting countries who \\"made the criticism that the Satoyama Initiative would augment local production for local consumption, and thus inhibit free trade in goods in the spirit of the GATT Uruguay Round\\" before it was finally included in the COP 10 decision. International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI) The International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI), one of the major institutional components under the Satoyama Initiative, is a partnership established on 19 October 2010 \\"to promote the activities identified by the Satoyama Initiative\\".

Fishing in a tailrace requires a distinct set of skills in that lures or bait must be moved through the flowing water to the feeding spots in the currents. Hydro tailrace fishing occurs in the discharge of hydroelectric power stations below a dam. Fishing below spillways is another form of tailrace fishing in which the turbulent water below the dam creates pockets of water that trap bait fish and attract gamefish. Types of tailrace fishing Hydro tailrace fishing is a more modern form of fishing the turbulent waters below reservoirs. The term hydro generation refers to the massive generators within a dam structure that are propelled by the force of gravity pushed by the vessel of water through an impeller which rotates the rotor causing lines of magnetic flux thus creating electric current which can then be transmitted as electricity. When vanes or valves are opened the water immediately flows from the above reservoir, causing turbulent water below the dam structure. Generation once started can last for a few minutes and up to months at times if all mechanical conditions and market demand is required from the governing utility or municipality. Hydro tailrace fishing is angling with rod and reel using artificial or live bait through these swift waters. Kinetic tailrace fishing is angling with fishing rod and reel below a dam, spillway or weir or any structure which has a drop in elevation that causes turbulent or swift moving water at its base. An example would be Mission Valley Dam on the Guadalupe River on the northern end of Lake Dunlap in New Braunsfels, Texas. Free flowing rivers and streams which flow over a Dam structure are the most common types of dams that can provide tailrace fishing. Access Hydro tailrace fisherman face many obstacles in securing their rights as a group of fishermen. One example of regaining lost rights is the Freedom to Fish Act that came out of a dispute with the Corps of Engineers attempt to restrict access below dams on the Cumberland River.

The film won the Special Jury Award for Breakout First Feature at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, where it premiered. It is the first documentary to follow an active FBI case while in progress. It is the first film for Cabral and the second for Sutcliffe. Sutcliffe said the film's intention was to show informants and their targets, and focus on the \\"decisions, tactics and objectives of counterterrorism cases.\\" The film aired on US television on the PBS series Independent Lens. The film was re-titled FBI Undercover when broadcast in the UK by the BBC as part of their Storyville TV series. The story was also retold on This American Life. Background Co-director Cabral was a student living in Harlem when her downstairs neighbor of four years, Saeed Torres, disappeared in May 2005. Cabral's investigation into his disappearance eventually became the subject of her film. Shortly before Torres' disappearance, Sutcliffe and Cabral met at an afterschool arts program, where one of their students, Adama Bah, a 16-year-old Muslim teenage girl was arrested by the FBI and accused of being a \\"potential\\" suicide bomber. Her arrest triggered a growing interest for both Cabral and Sutcliffe in the FBI's counterterrorism tactics, and an increasing awareness of the central role of informants in the majority of domestic terror plots.

St. Paul's has the distinction of being the very first Tamil Anglican Church in the erstwhile Mysore State. St. Paul's celebrated its 175th anniversary in May 2014. Like most old churches of Bangalore, the congregation of St. Pauls is spread all across Bangalore. History Rev. George Trevor (1809-1859), Chaplin, East India Company, re-established the Church of England Bangalore Tamil Mission, which was originally found by Rev. William Thomas in the early 19th century. Rev. Trevor, supervised a schoolmaster and a Catechist of the Tamil mission. The native Tamil congregation worshipped at the St. Mark's Church, with the Tamil services being conducted by the Catechist. The christening and the baptisms of the Tamil converts were also recorded in the registers of St. Mark's. Rev. Trevor, took an active part in missionary work, in spite of his heavy civil and military duties as Chaplin of the East India Company in Bangalore, with him personally baptising many new native converts. However, the Government of Madras, raised objections of the use of the registers of St. Mark's (which was a then a Company church), as it gave the impression that the Government was involved in converting the natives. Rev. Trevor then contacted Sir. Mark Cubbon, the then Chief Commissioner of Mysore, and was able to obtain a site in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station for a church and school for the native Tamil congregation, and raised funds to build the same. There existed a St. Paul‚Äôs Tamil Medium Primary School at the present site of the Church, since 1835, till it was closed down in 1900. The Native Tamil Anglicans (mainly converted \\"sepoys\\" or soldiers of the Madras Army), wanted a Tamil Anglican church for worship in their native language. The clergy of the St. Mark's Church helped in establishing the St. Paul's Church, the first Tamil Anglican church in Mysore State. Rev. George Trevor, Chaplin, East India Company, raised a local subscription towards building the church, while the Church of England also contributed ¬£50 towards its construction. The church was built in the compound of the St. Paul‚Äôs Tamil Medium Primary School. The 180-year-old school building has now been renovated and serves as the community parish hall. According to Rev. A Westcott, as recorded in his book 'Our Oldest Indian Mission: A Brief History of the Vepery (Madras) Mission', Rev. G Trevor, the Company Chaplain helped raise funds for building the Tamil Church. Bishop Spencer laid the foundation in August 1839. The church was completed at a cost of BINR 1250 and consecrated in March 1840 as 'The Mission Church of St. Paul.' The act of consecration specifically states that the Church is dedicated for Divine Services in the Tamil languages only. At this time there were around 132 Christian families attached to the Bangalore Mission. Missionaries, the elders and the congregation of St. Mark's Church identified a suitable place for building a separate church for the Tamil Anglican community, in 1838. Works commenced in the same year, under the guidance of Rev. George Trevor. The church was consecrated on 31 March 1840 by the Lord Bishop of Madras, the Rev. George Trevor Spencer, with Rev. S. J. Joshua (SPG) as its first parish priest. Both St. Mark's Church and St. Paul's Church were supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG). SPG Records Bangalore was a town having a 60,000 population, and prior to 1837 there was only a native catechist who looked after the needs of the local native christian population, and also ran a school for about a dozen children. The catechist read the church services in the school house located in the Bangalore Cantonment for about 30-40 natives. Rev. G Treveor took charge of the mission on 1838 and started a subscription for building a church and maintaining a church. By 1844, the number of children in the schools has increased to 180, with 20-40 females, and the number of schools for natives in the Cantonment were three. The Bishop laid the foundation for the church on 5 August 1839, and was completed in 6 months, to be consecrated on 31 March 1840, as the 'Mission Church of St. Paul'. The consecration act particularly mentions that the church was dedicated for device services in the Tamil language only. The church services in Tamil commenced on Sunday 5 April 1840. Everyday morning prayers were held at 7:30AM, and full services with sermon on Sundays at 10:30AM and 4:30PM. Rev. Trevor visited the church for administering the Lord's Supper and the Sacraments of Baptism. The Total cost for building the church was about ¬£125 (BINR 1250.14), and ¬£89.8 for the school room in the churchyard. On the day of the consecration, about BINR 354 was still owing with Rev. Treveor taking responsibility for the debt (else the consecration would have been delayed). The debt was settled in full the next day by a donation by a friend of Rev. Trevor, who wished to remain anonymous. After the church opened, around 80 people attended services on Sundays, and about 50 during weekdays. On occasions such as Christmas and Easter around 150 people attended, even though the church was designed to accommodate 200 people. By 1844, around 333 people (76 men, 128 women, and 129 children) had been baptised by the church. A native catechist, three readers, two school masters and a school mistresses were employed and maintained by local subscriptions, and were supervised by Mr. Bayly. Rev. J Bilderbeck a missionary preached once in the church and examined the schools. By 1844, there were around 132 families in the congregation, and the school has 111 scholars (64 christian, and 47 non- christian), with average daily attendance of 95, and about 40 being able to read. Pettigrew's Records, 1864 S T Pettigrew describes the Church of England mission chapel as being nothing more than a plain and ugly building. An oblong structure having plastered walls, holes with wooden shutters for the windows. The interior was brick and mortar construction, 9 ft height serving as pulpit. A common table covered with an old red baize cloth was used as the altar. There were no seats, as the native population were used to sitting on the floor. A verandah which ran on the north and south sides of the chapel gave protection against the sun. A low mud wall served as the compound. At the entrance, existed a triangle which was used for punishing recalcitrant drummer, and in this triangle was the bell used for summoning the worshippers. A native deacon lived in a portion of the native schools, opposite to the church. The deacon received his stipend from the Venerable Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and the school was being run by voluntary donations. =History= Pettigrew went through the records of the church and describes its history. The church has its roots in the 18th century, being first planted by some German missionaries related to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. It was then transferred to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and managed by a committee based in Madras. A spark of life was given to this church in 1817, when a chaplain brought together the scattered congregation. For the next 19 years, the worship was done in the small schoolroom with the sacraments being administered by the chaplain of the St. Mark;s Church in English, which was not understood by the Tamil natives. Under Canon Trevor of York, the mission was re-constituted with the church being rebuilt covered by subscription and funds provided by SPCK. Additional schools were also opened. On 31 March 1940, he church was consecrated as 'St. Paul's Mission Church' for the purpose of native Christians. Later a missionary was appointed by SPG and a mission house constructed. In 1852, Bishop Dealtry gave licence for a native priest, but was shorty withdrawn. In 1864, there was one native deacon, one catechist, a school master and a school mistress, the native congregation by that reaching 300. The Boys school attached to the church had 40 students, and the girls school 30 students, who were provided a daily meal and given clothes once a year with funds provided by a benevolent lady resident of the Cantonment. Renovations A record of an alteration to St. Paul's has been recorded in 1865. Samuel Thomas Pettigrew, Station Chaplain of the East India Company stationed at the Bangalore Civil and Military Station extended, altered and improved the St. Paul's Tamil SPG Church. Before that it is recorded as being ugly and small. S T Pettigrew also founded the All Saints Church, on Hosur Road, Richmond Town in 1870, and served as the chaplain of the St Mark‚Äôs Cathedral from 1863 to 1867 and 1869 to 1872. Other that the above, the church building has been altered and extended at least four times (as recorded), in 1901, 1936, 1947 and recently in 2007. =1901 - Eastern side= Below the baptismal altar in the church, there is a stone, dated 7 March 1901, AD, which marks the extension of the Eastern side of the church, acknowledging the benevolence of Mr. Joseph David, this being the first recorded extension of the church. =1936 - Western side= In 1936, the western side of the church was extended, with the foundation being laid by Rev. Canon H. H. Flynn on 13 April 1936, and the completed church re-dedicated by the Rt. Rev. E. H. M. Waller, DD, Lord Bishop of Madras, on 11 October 1936. This now houses the vestry and choir room. The tablets for this second recorded extension are on the side of the church facing the setting sun. =1947 - Southern side= In 1947, Rt. Rev. Pakenaham laid the foundation for the extension on the Southern side, for housing the holy sanctuary and chancel. A brass tablet located beside the arch of the sanctuary acknowledges this event. Funds were raised by the Mother's Union. The consecration of the altar sanctuary was performed by Rt. Rev. P Gurushantha, Bishop, Mysore Diocese. A circular cross embedded silver plate acknowledges this event, this being the third extension of the church. 175th anniversary The church celebrated its 175 years of existence in May 2014. The celebrations were led by Rt. Rev. Y William, retired bishop of the CSI Vellore Diocese. An eternal lamp was lit, using the flame brought from the St. Mark's Cathedral, the mother church of St. Paul's. On 19 April 2015, a special commemorative Post Cover was released by India Post (Special Cover approval no. KTK/38/2015) to mark 175 years of St. Paul's Church. The Postal cover was released by Rt. Rev. Dr. Prasanna Kumar Samuel, Rev. D John Milton and S Shivaram, Senior Superintendent of Post Offices on the occasion of the celebration of Septaquintaquinque centennial celebrations service at the church. Community services The church is located right next to the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital. The church was established 20 years before the hospital was built. Being, next to the hospital, the church offers solace to people of all religions and communities who drop in to offer prayers for their loved ones who are admitted to the hospital.

It was discovered in 2008 and the scientific description was published in 2015. Radiometric dating indicates that it is about 54,700 years old (the late Mousterian), and thought to be directly ancestral to the Upper Paleolithic populations of the Levant and Europe.Israel Hershkovitz et al. Levantine cranium from Manot Cave (Israel) foreshadows the first European modern humans. Nature, published online January 28, 2015; doi: 10.1038/nature14134 Discovery Manot Cave under excavation in 2011 Manot 1 was discovered inside the Manot Cave when the cave itself was discovered in 2008. The cave is situated in Western Galilee, about 10 km north of the HaYonim Cave and 50 km northeast of Mt. Carmel Cave. It was discovered accidentally when a bulldozer cracked open its roof during construction work. Archaeologists from the Cave Research Unit of Hebrew University of Jerusalem were immediately informed and made the initial survey. They found the skullcap alongside stone tools, charcoal pieces, and other human remains. Tools found included a Levallois point, burins, bladelets, overpassed blades, and Aurignacian tools. They also found remains of \\"fallow deer, red deer, mountain gazelle, horse, aurochs, hyena, and bear\\". They reported it to the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), which granted another brief survey of the cave. The IAA granted a full-scale excavation in 2010. The excavation was conducted by a collaboration of archaeologists from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv University, Geological Survey of Israel, Zinman Institute of Archaeology of University of Haifa, Kimmel Center for Archaeological Sciences of Weizmann Institute of Science, and the Department of Archaeology of Boston University. Description Manot 1 is an adult individual represented by an almost complete skullcap (calvaria) very similar to those of modern humans. But it has a relatively small brain size, which is estimated at around 1,100 mL, compared to modern human brain which is about 1,400 mL. Its unique features are the bun-shaped occipital, the moderate arch of the parietals, flat sagittal area, presence of a suprainiac fossa, and the pronounced superior nuchal line. These combined features indicate that it shares a number of features between the most recent African humans and those of European from the Upper Paleolithic period. But it has notable differences from those of other archaic humans found in the neighbouring Levant. It may also possibly be a human-Neanderthal hybrid. The discoverers concluded that: Significance The Skhul 5 and Skhul 9 skulls, dated to between 120,000 and 80,000 years old, are the oldest known anatomically modern human fossils found in West Asia. Manot 1, at 55,000 years old, is the oldest fossil found in West Asia which post- dates the presumed recent out-of-Africa expansion, after about 70,000 years ago. It is thought to be ancestral to the modern Western Eurasian lineages that began to develop during the Upper Paleolithic. The age of the fossil is consistent with the period of interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans. While extraction and sequencing of DNA from the remains could potentially confirm that interbreeding was occurring at that time, the odds of doing so successfully are reduced by the region's warm climate, which speeds up DNA degradation.

It is done via the addition of a reactive polymer, miscible with one blend component and reactive towards functional groups on the second component, which result in the \\"in-situ\\" formation of block or grafted copolymers. A large number of commercial polymeric products are derived from the blending of two or more polymers to achieve a favorable balance of physical properties. However, since most polymer blends are immiscible, it is rare to find a pair of polymers that both are miscible and have desired characteristics. An example of such pair is the miscible resin NORYL‚Ñ¢, a mix of poly(phenylene oxide) and polystyrene. Immiscible blends will phase separate and form a dispersed phase, which may improve physical properties (figure 1). DuPont‚Äôs rubber toughened Nylon consists of small particles of poly(cis-isoprene) (natural rubber) in a Nylon matrix that toughen the material by arresting crack propagation. Miscibility of Polymer Blends The Gibbs free energy of mixing, \\\\Delta G_(mix)= \\\\Delta H_(mix)-T\\\\Delta S_(mix) , must be negative for a blend to be miscible. According to Flory-Huggins theory, a revision of regular solution theory, the entropy change per mole of lattice sites of blending polymer 1 and polymer 2 is \\\\Delta S_(mix,blend) = -R \\\\left({\\\\phi_1\\\\over x_1}\\\\ln \\\\phi_1 + {\\\\phi_2\\\\over x_2}\\\\ln \\\\phi_2 \\\\right) , where ŒîS is the change in entropy of mixing, R is the gas constant, Œ¶ is the volume fraction of each polymer, and x is the number of segments of each polymer.Rudin, Alfred, and Phillip Choi. The Elements of Polymer Science and Engineering. 3rd. Oxford: Academic Press, 2013. Print. x1 and x2 increase with higher degrees of polymerization and thus molecular weight. Since most useful polymers are high in molecular weight, the change in entropy experienced from the mixing of two large polymer chains is very low, and typically does not bring the Gibbs free energy low enough to constitute miscibility. Compatibilization Most processed polymer mixes consist of a dispersed phase in a more continuous matrix of the other component. The formation, size, and concentration of this disperse phase are typically optimized for specific mechanical properties. If the morphology is not stabilized, the dispersed phase may coalesce under heat or stress from the environment or further processing. This coalescence may result in diminished properties (brittleness and discoloration) due to the induced phase separation. These morphologies can be stabilized by sufficient interfacial adhesion or lowered interfacial tension between the two phases. A common technique involves functionalizing one monomer. For example, Nylon-rubber bands are polymerized with functionalized rubber to produce graft or block copolymers. The added structures make it no longer favorable to coalesce and/or increase the steric hindrance in the interfacial area where phase separation would occur.

Background Go Noi Island was located approximately 25 km south of Danang to the west of Highway 1, together with the area directly north of the island, nicknamed Dodge City by the Marines due to frequent ambushes and firefights there, it was a Vietcong (VC) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) stronghold and base area. While the island was relatively flat, the small hamlets on the island were linked by hedges and concealed paths providing a strong defensive network. Go Noi was the base for the VC's Group 44 headquarters for Qu·∫£ng Nam Province, the R-20 and V-25 Battalions and the T-3 Sapper Battalion and, it was believed, elements of the PAVN 2nd Division. The 3rd Battalion 7th Marines had conducted Operation Jasper Square on the island during April with minimal results. At the beginning of May the 1st Marine Division headquarters ordered a new operation on Go Noi. Operation M48s of Company B, 5th Tank Battalion accompany Company E, 2/7 Marines on a sweep of Go Noi Island On the morning of 4 May 1968 two Companies of the 2nd Battalion 7th Marines supported by tanks crossed the Liberty Bridge () onto the island meeting only light resistance for the first few days. On 7 May Company A 1st Battalion 7th Marines relieved one Company from 2/7 Marines and Company K 3/7 Marines was added to the operation. By 8 May the Marines had lost nine killed and 57 wounded and the VC 88 killed. On the evening of 9 May the Marines encountered heavy resistance at the hamlet of Xuan Dai (2), after calling in air strikes the Marines overran the hamlet resulting in 80 PAVN killed. On 13 May Company I 3rd Battalion 27th Marines was deployed to the Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains southwest of Go Noi moving east onto the island and the Marines on the island began sweeping west linking up at the Liberty Bridge on 15 May. Company E 2/7 Marines and the command group were airlifted out of the area on the evening of 15 May. The Marines then began a deception plan crossing the Liberty Bridge as if the operation had concluded and then crossing back onto the island on the early morning of 16 May. At 09:00 on 16 May 3/7 Marines encountered a PAVN Battalion at the hamlet of Phu Dong (2) (), the Marines were unable to outflank the PAVN and called in air and artillery support as the battle continued all day. By nightfall the PAVN abandoned their positions leaving more than 130 dead while Marine losses were 25 dead and 38 wounded. The hamlet was found to contain a PAVN Regimental headquarters and vast quantities of supplies. On the morning of 17 May 3/7 Marines moved out of Phu Dong (2) patrolling southeast. Company I, 3/27 Marines was leading the column when it was ambushed by a strongly entrenched PAVN force near the hamlet of Le Nam (1) (). The other Marine Companies attempted to assist Company I, but the PAVN defenses proved too strong and artillery support was the only way to relieve the pressure on Company I. It was decided that Companies K and L 3/27 Marines would air assault into the area and the first helicopters landed at 15:00 and Company K broke through to relieve Company I at 19:30 while the PAVN withdrew. Marine losses were 39 dead and 105 wounded while PAVN losses were 81 killed. PFC Robert C. Burke a machine-gunner in Company I would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle. On 18 May 3rd Battalion 5th Marines replaced 3/7 Marines and operational control passed to 3/27 Marines. At 09:30 the Marines began taking sniper fire from the hamlet of Le Bac (2)(). Companies K and L were sent to clear out the snipers but were quickly pinned down by another well-prepared PAVN ambush. Airstrikes and artillery fire were called in but due to the proximity of the opposing forces were of limited effect. At 15:00 Company M, 3/27 Marines arrived by helicopter to replace Company L and cover the retreat of Company K and air and artillery strikes were directed against Le Bac (2). Marine losses were 15 killed, 35 wounded and over 90 cases of heat exhaustion while PAVN losses were 20 killed. For the next six days the Marines continued patrolling, suffering frequent ambushes despite strong preparatory fires. The Marines altered their tactics so that when the enemy was encountered they would hold their positions or pull back to allow air and artillery to deal with the entrenched forces. From 24‚Äì7 May a sustained fight took place at the hamlet of Le Bac (1), only ending when torrential rain made further fighting impossible. By the end of May total casualties for the battle were 138 Marines killed and 686 wounded while PAVN/VC losses exceeded 600 killed. Intelligence later determined that the PAVN force encountered by the Marines was the 36th Regiment, 308th Division which had only recently arrived in South Vietnam and that they were probably deployed in preparation for an attack on Danang as part of the \\"mini-Tet\\" or May Offensive. Operation Allen Brook prevented any such attack and mini-Tet in Danang was marked only by increased rocket attacks on the base areas. On 26 May the 1st Battalion 26th Marines reinforced the operation, while on the 28th 3/27 Marines was relieved by 1st Battalion 27th Marines and 3/5 Marines was returned to the Division reserve. During early June the 1/26 and 1/27 Marines carried out ongoing search and clear operations on the island with regular ambushes by small PAVN/Vietcong forces. On 5 June as the Marine Battalions moved west along the island they were ambushed by a PAVN force at the hamlet of Cu Ban (3), due to the proximity of the enemy forces supporting fire was ineffective and a confused close-quarters battle raged throughout the day until tanks allowed the Marines to overrun the enemy positions. Marines losses were seven killed and 55 wounded while PAVN losses were 30 killed. On 6 June 1/26 Marines was withdrawn from the operation and elements of the 1st Engineer Battalion arrived with orders to destroy the fortifications on Go Noi with 1/27 Marines providing security. On the early morning of 15 June a PAVN force attacked Company B 1/17 Marines' night defensive position, the attack was defeated with 21 PAVN killed for no Marine losses. On 19 June Companies B and D were ambushed by the PAVN at the hamlet of Bac Dong Ban, the fight lasted nine hours before the Marines were able to overrun the PAVN bunkers. Marine losses were six killed and 19 wounded while the PAVN lost 17 killed. On 23 June 2nd Battalion 27th Marines relieved 1/27 Marines on Go Noi. 2/27 Marines stayed on Go Noi until 16 July when it was relieved by 3/27 Marines. Marine losses during this period were four Marines killed and 177 wounded for 144 PAVN/Vietcong killed. On 31 July, BLT 2/7 Marines which had just completed Operation Swift Play in the Da The mountains 6 km south of Go Noi arrived on the island and relieved 3/27 Marines. Land clearing operations on Go Noi continued into August by which time much of the island had been completely levelled and seeded with herbicides. As enemy activity had been reduced to a minimal level it was decided to close the operation. While much of their infrastructure had been destroyed the PAVN/VC continued to resist until the last as the Marines and Engineers withdrew across the Liberty Bridge harassed by sniper fire. Aftermath Operation Allen Brook concluded on 24 August, the Marines had suffered 172 dead and 1124 wounded while claiming the PAVN/VC suffered 917 killed and 11 captured.

He also built new and improved scientific instruments and made military engineering designs. Coignet was a scientist at the court of the governors of the Spanish Netherlands Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and Isabella Clara Eugenia where he held a position similar to that of his compatriot Simon Stevin at the rival court of Maurice, Prince of Orange.Meskens (2013) Life Frontispiece of the Instruction nouvelle, 1581, Antwerp G√©ometrie reduite en une facile et briefve practique par deux excellens instrumens, 1626 Michiel Coignet‚Äôs father Gillis (also known as Egidius) was a goldsmith and maker of astronomical and mathematical instruments in Antwerp and was married to Brigitte Anthonis Hendriksd. Michiel‚Äôs brother Jacob III became a physician while his brother Gillis I became a painter. Michiel‚Äôs father died in 1562-1563. The details on Michiel‚Äôs education are scarce.Meskens (2013), p. 14 He was admitted to the St Ambrose Guild of School Teachers in 1568. He taught French and mathematics. It is likely that at the time he started working as a teacher he had already studied higher mathematics since the mathematics class he taught was referred to as 'mathematicam' whereas lower mathematics was referred to as 'cijfferen' (calculation).Ad Meskens, Een familie herenigd met haar instrument, in: Scientiarum Historia 27 (2001) 1, pp. 73‚Äì81 He married Maria vanden Eynde c. 1570 and the couple would have 10 children. Only their son Antonius was still alive at the time of his death.Meskens (2013), p. 15 In 1572-73 Michiel Coignet was appointed by the city as 'wijnroeier' ('wine gauger'). The wijnroeier was a municipal employee tasked with measuring the wine barrels that arrived in the city in order to calculate the taxes due. From the year 1572 also dates Michiel‚Äôs first signed instrument, an astrolabium. This is an indication that his mother likely kept her deceased husband‚Äôs workshop in operation until her son could become a master of the Guild of Saint Luke. Michiel became a member of the Guild as the son of a member in 1581 and became a full master in 1589 after a period of apprenticeship. He also became a member of the Guild of Meerse, which was the guild of the shopkeepers and wine gaugers.Meskens (2013), p. 16 Michiel Coignet converted to the Protestant faith. After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585, he joined a local schutterij called the 'kolveniersgilde'. Since only Catholics were typically allowed to join the schutterij it is assumed that he had reconverted to Catholicism. His brother Gillis, however, did not and emigrated to Amsterdam where he had a successful career as an artist. In 1585 Coignet stopped teaching except for classes for military officers and sons of prosperous merchants.Ad Meskens, Michiel Coignet's contribution tot the development of the sector, In: Annals of science. 54 (1997), pp. 143‚Äì160 Michiel Coignet remained in this position of 'wijnroeier' until he started his service as a mathematician and engineer for the Archdukes in 1596. He would remain in court service until his death in 1623. In 1604 Coignet received a further stipend from the court for his role as of cosmographer.Meskens (2013), p. 19 In 1606, he remarried after the death of his first wife in November 1605 and had four children from this second marriage.Meskens (2013), p. 20 One of them was the painter Michiel II Coignet (1618-1663).Meskens (2013), p. 22 In the summer of 1623 Coignet made a request to the Archduchess Isabella to get a pension. She yielded his request and decided to grant him a single lump sum for his services. However, Coignet died before the sum was paid. The Archduchess Isabella wanted to have his works published, but this plan was not realized. Instrument making Coignet invented several instruments and corresponded with Galileo Galilei (from 1588), Gerhard Mercator, Godefroy Wendelin, Ludolph van Ceulen and Fabrizio Mordente, whom he met during the latter‚Äôs 1584 sojourn in Antwerp. Among other things, Coignet invented and described instruments that had a function similar to that of the proportional compass.Gerard L'Estrange Turner, Elizabethan instrument makers : the origins of the London trade in precision, Oxford University Press, p. 70 During the dispute over the invention of the proportional compass in 1610, Giovanni Camillo Gloriosi attributed the invention to Coignet and not to Galileo, although the instrument is now mainly attributed to Coignet‚Äôs friend Mordente.Michel Coignet at museogalileo Coignet distributed the computational functions over several bars and described the instrument in several treatises: on the flat ruler (Trait√© des Sinus, 1610); flat-legged proportional compasses (De regulae pantometae, 1612); and four- point proportional compasses (El uso del compas proportional, 1618). Navigation Nautical hemisphere, illustration from the Instruction nouvelle Strongly encouraged by Gillis Hooftman in 1580 Coignet published a treatise on navigation entitled Nieuwe Onderwijsinghe op de principaelste Puncten der Zeevaert ('New Instructions on the Principal Points of Navigation'). It was published by the Antwerp publisher Hendrik Hendriksen as an appendix to the Dutch-language translation of Pedro de Medina's Arte de Navegar.Meskens (2013), p. 139 In the appendix he pointed to the possibility of determining longitude at sea with watches on the ships. He also described some of his newly invented instruments such as the nautical hemisphere.Meskens (2013), p. 148 The nautical hemisphere is an instrument with which the longitude problem could, in theory, be solved. In 2008 an example of this instrument, likely made in Coignet‚Äôs workshop, surfaced during an exhibition on the history of the Jesuit Seminary of Tournai.Ad Meskens, Een zeesfeer van Michiel Coignet?, in: Studium : Tijdschrift voor Wetenschaps- en Universiteits-Geschiedenis , 201, pp. 53‚Äì56 An expanded, French-language version of the 'Nieuwe Onderwijsinghe prepared by Coignet was published in 1581 by Hendrik Hendriksen under the title Instruction nouvelle des poincts plus excellents et n√©cessaires, touchant l'art de naviguer... nouvellement practiqu√© et compos√© en langue thioise, par Michiel Coignet,... Depuis reveu et augment√© par le mesme autheur‚Ä¶Meskens (2013), p. 146 Cartography Around 1600 Coignet became involved in the publication of atlases. He edited various editions of the world maps of Abraham Ortelius. He added an introduction on projections and 13 maps to some editions of Ortelius' atlas published as Epitome theatri orbis terrarum d'Ortelius (1601). The Latin-language 'Epitome' was quickly translated into English and French. Coignet edited the French version published in Antwerp. One of the new maps was a map with a description of Japan, for which he had obtained the information from Jesuit sources.Donald F. Lach, Asia in the Making of Europe, Volume II: A Century of Wonder. Book 2: The Literary Arts, Volume 2, University of Chicago Press, 15 Jan 2010, p. 357 Coignet also added an introduction to the atlas Speculum Orbis terrarum of Gerard de Jode.Meskens (2013), pp. 169‚Äì171 In 1621 Coignet drew a map that showed the preferred itinerary for merchants and merchandise traveling from Flanders to Milan (two copies are preserved one of which is kept in the library of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. The map was promoted in May 1621 by the Antwerp newspaper Nieuwe Tijdinghe in an advertisement that referred to the route as the Prince conduitte since the route fell supposedly under the protection of the Archdukes. The advertisement claimed that the proposed itinerary would reduce travel time by 10 to 12 days and was 'without danger'.Geoffrey Parker, The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road, 1567-1659: The Logistics of Spanish Victory and Defeat in the Low Countries' Wars, Cambridge University Press, 14 October 2004 Mathematics Theatrum orbis terrarum, edited by Michiel Coignet, Antwerp, 1612 Coignet may have been a pupil of the German mathematician Valentin Mennher, whose books he published in new editions after Mennher's death in 1570. He also edited Willem Raets' Arithmetica in 1580 and included an appendix on wine gauging. As a mathematician Coignet was highly regarded by his contemporaries and was praised by the Flemish mathematician Adriaan van Roomen. He taught the subject including during his European tour when he instructed Marin Getaldiƒá and the officers of Archduke Albert. Getaldiƒá was later in Paris from where he informed Coignet in a letter dated 15 February 1600 about the mathematician Fran√ßois Vi√®te.Reprinted in his De Numerosa potestatum ad exegesim resolutione Military engineering design Coignet was involved in various military engineering projects mainly related to fortification and wrote about ballistics in one of his treatises (El uso de las doze diuisiones geometricas, 1618). From 1596 he worked for the Archdukes on the fortification of the forts along the Scheldt river. He took on an advisory role in the Siege of Hulst of 1596 and the Siege of Ostend from 1602 to 1604. In 1608 he designed together with the municipal surveyor Mattheus van Herle a fortification in the area of the St Michael‚Äôs Abbey. Around 1614 he made further military maps. During that time he was in charge of inspecting the excavation of the city moats. He discovered that the contractor was making the moats too narrow and tried to cut off some of the corners to save time. He was forced to conduct regular inspections in order to curb these malpractices. During this time he may also have been involved in the reparation of the city walls and the design of a new fort on the left bank of the Scheldt river. In 1618 he discussed with Don I√±igo de Borgia, the commander of the Spanish garrison, the construction of two guard posts on the city walls.Meskens (2013), pp. 197‚Äì210 References Sources *Ad Meskens, Practical mathematics in a commercial metropolis: Mathematical life in late 16th century Antwerp, Springer Science & Business Media, 12 Mar 2013 Category:Flemish engineers Category:Flemish scientists Category:Flemish mathematicians Category:Flemish astronomers Category:Civil engineers Category:People from Antwerp Category:1549 births Category:1623 deaths Category:16th-century engineers Category:17th-century engineers ","title":"Michiel Coignet"},{"id":"45298446","text":"Pinqullu (Aymara for a kind of flute of the Andes, Hispanicized spelling Pencoyllo) is a mountain in the Chunta mountain range in the Andes of Peru, about high.

Plot  The show is about the mythological story of Devi Durga and Mahishashur - how the Devi killed the Asur and became Mahishashurmardini. Shiva Purana gives an account of the origin of Durga. At the beginning of time, Lord Shiva invoked Durga, the primordial energy from his left half to create. Together they created their eternal abode, Shivaloka, also known as Kashi. Thereafter, they created Vishnu and Brahma. As per Shiva Purana and Devi Mahatmyah, Mahishasura, the son of demon Rambha, unleashed reign of terror on earth. When gods intervened, Mahishasura defeated gods and banished them from heaven. Vanquished gods went to Trideva- Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. As they narrated their woeful tale, immense mass of light manifested from Lord Vishnu's mouth, which was joined by similar rays that emerged from the enraged faces of gods. This mass of light transformed into a woman. Then all the Gods gave their devine weapon to that supreme power. Adishakti re-manifested as Durga to slay Mahishasura. Armed with celestial weapons of all deities and decked with divine ornaments, Durga rode into the battle field and challenged demons for battle. Mahishasura's entire army, led by demons like Chikshur, Chamar, Asiloma, Vidalaksha, Durdhara, Durmukha, Mahahanu and many more attacked Durga at once. But Durga slew all of them with unparalleled cruelty. An enraged Mahishasura attacked Durga in guise of a buffalo. But Durga bound it with ropes. The buffalo morphed into a lion and leapt on Durga, but she beheaded it with her sword. At this, Mahishasura began to fight in form of a swordsman. Durga pinned him down with a torrent of arrows. Mahishasura now assumed form of a giant elephant and tugged at Durga's lion. Durga lopped off its trunk with her sword and freed her lion. The elephant turned into a buffalo and charged at Durga. Sipping from her wine cup, Durga pierced Mahishasura's chest with her trident, finally killing him.

She is the wife of the man she managed for much of her career, Jimmy Garvin. Career =World Class Championship Wrestling (1983‚Äì1984)= Patti Williams made her professional wrestling debut in 1983 for the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling. She was brought in by her real-life husband Jimmy Garvin to be an assistant to his valet at the time, Sunshine (Garvin's real-life cousin), who gave her the name Sunshine II. On October 31, 1983, Garvin fired Sunshine for causing him to lose the WCCW Television Championship to Johnny Mantell, while retaining Sunshine II's place, and changing her name to Precious, the name previously used by Sunshine's predecessor, Garvin's original valet. Precious's first big rivalry with Jimmy Garvin was with Sunshine, who aligned herself with Chris Adams, whom Garvin would feud over the NWA American Heavyweight Championship. She would wrestle three mixed tag team matches in 1984: one with Adams and Sunshine on May 6, and two with Adams and Stella Mae French on June 16, and a steel cage losers leaves town match on July 4. =American Wrestling Association (1984‚Äì1986)= After a tour with All Japan Pro Wrestling, Precious and Jimmy Garvin went over to the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association in 1984. After Garvin's feud with Rick Martel over the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, she steered Garvin onto the AWA World Tag Team Championship, held by The Road Warriors. With \\"Mr. Electricity\\" Steve Regal joining the couple, she led Garvin and Regal to win the titles from the Warriors on September 29, 1985, with the help of Garvin's friends from WCCW, The Fabulous Freebirds. After Garvin and Regal lost the titles to Scott Hall and Curt Hennig in January 1986, Precious and Garvin left the territory. =Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1986‚Äì1988, 1992)= Precious and Jimmy Garvin joined the Charlotte, North Carolina-based Jim Crockett Promotions in 1986. For the Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tournament in April, they selected Black Bart to team with Garvin; they defeated Brett Sawyer and David Patterson in the first round, but lost to Giant Baba and Tiger Mask II in the second round. In September 1986, Precious and Garvin chose future Four Horsemen member Tully Blanchard to join forces with them for the tournament to determine the inaugural NWA United States Tag Team Champions; they defeated Jimmy Valiant and Manny Fernandez in the first round, but lost to The Kansas Jayhawks (Dutch Mantel and Bobby Jaggers) in the semi- finals. In February 1987, Precious turned babyface alongside Jimmy Garvin and joined forces with her brother-in-law Ron Garvin (actually Precious' stepfather-in-law). In the summer of 1987, Precious played a major part in a feud between the Garvins and Ric Flair, where Flair tried to woo Precious, even buying her a mink coat. After defeating Jimmy Garvin in a cage match, Flair won the right to spend the night with Precious, but she and the Garvins got the last laugh, as Flair instead spent the night with Miss Atlanta Lively (Ron Garvin in drag), setting the stage for Ron to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Flair. In 1988, Precious and the Garvins feuded with The Varsity Club, especially Kevin Sullivan. Jimmy tried winning the NWA World Television Championship from Mike Rotunda several times, but ended up losing due to Sullivan's interference. Throughout the feud, Sullivan played mind games with the Garvins over Precious, including calling her by her real name and stalking her with papers in his robe. On July 10, at The Great American Bash, Precious was involved in the Tower Of Doom match, where she held the key to the door of the larger, bottom part of the triple-tier steel cage. The Garvins, The Road Warriors, and Dr. Death Steve Williams won the match, but after the match, Sullivan took the key and locked himself in with Precious, before being saved by Road Warrior Hawk. On the September 3 episode of World Championship Wrestling, Precious and Jimmy Garvin were scheduled to wrestle Mike Rotunda for the NWA World Television title, but before the match was scheduled to start, Sullivan grabbed Precious, causing Jimmy Garvin to go after Sullivan, before being jumped by Rotunda and Steiner, before Sullivan slammed concrete blocks onto Garvin's leg. It was her last appearance for four years. Precious briefly returned to WCW in May 1992 at WrestleWar, aligning herself with The Fabulous Freebirds, which consisted of her husband Jimmy Garvin and Michael Hayes, who had just won the WCW United States Tag Team titles from Greg Valentine and Terry Taylor. She retired after Garvin left WCW. Personal life Patti married Jimmy Garvin in 1972. Together, they have two daughters and they are involved in a ministry for the poor and homeless.

She performed before a 30-person audience. The subject of the slam was \\"Portrait of a Lady\\". The rap number was composed in one hour at the cafe. The video has been uploaded to YouTube using the handle \\"Delhi Poetry Slam\\". The addressee referred to in the title is Indian artist Yo Yo Honey Singh. Besides challenging Singh, the video criticizes extant value systems in the media, advertising and the arts that demean women and treat women as commodities, instead of persons. Context Honey Singh is an Indian rapper whose work has been perceived as being vulgar, misogynist, promoting violence against women and a bad influence on youth. There have been reactions in prose to Singh, such as from Annie Zaidi, who wrote her own \\"An Open Letter to Honey Singh\\" in January 2013, and Sandipan Sharma, who wrote \\"Thanks for the crassness: An open letter to Honey Singh from a parent\\" in July 2014. Review In part, the work is a response to the perceived misogyny in Singh's work. Verma said in an interview that on initially hearing Singh's \\"Blue Eyes\\" it \\"hooked\\" her, but that when she \\"paid attention to the lyrics\\" she realized they were \\"very problematic\\". Femina said that Verma uses phrases in Singh's works to express her disgust, and appreciates that the message Verma wishes to convey that every woman is intrinsically good the way she is. The target is not only Singh but also eve teasers, who were the template for works such as Singh's. Although there have been other protests against Singh's work, including petitions and an open letter written by Annie Zaidi in The Sunday Guardian, Verma's rap number uses the same artistic format as Singh and incorporates some of his own lyrics. Verma's work has been considered as an example of Indian women confronting adversities. Verma's work has been cited as an example of a spoken word performance being used as a revolutionary tool, and as parodying Singh while attacking the sexism in Singh's rap. Subsequently the video of another work of hers received over 180,000 hits on YouTube and was the subject of media attention, in which she was described as someone who had confronted Singh, and \\"slamming\\" and \\"knocking the wind out of\\" him. She was featured on The Arts Hour for the BBC World Service presented by Nikki Bedi, with her rap number \\"Reclaim the night\\". Social media The video was uploaded to YouTube on 28 January 2015. It went viral on social media and had received about a million hits on YouTube by 2 February 2015. As of August 10, 2015, the video had received over 1.6 million hits.

Very neat formally, En carne viva has his best times during the first hour of the film, where the native beauty of Rosa Carmina stands with own light among the foliage of a Veracruz recreated in a studio where Rosa Carmina seems her princess blue. Above all, the film is a feast for the eyes to recreate again and again in the beauty of the Cuban- Mexican actress, who runs very well her character: not only her oblique and distrustful look is enormously seductive, also it is very believable as she very going from the tenderness to the sensuality and from anguish to the wise resignation.Fantoscop√≠a Mexicana: En carne viva The producer, Alfonso Rosas Priego had a particularly fond of the argument.

Mar√≠a Esther falls in love with Carlos (David Silva), a sailor who had a previous relationship with a cabaret woman named Sofia (Mar√≠a Luisa Zea). A rivalry erupts between the two women.

One of the classic films of the Rumberas film is Humo en los ojos. In his essential and delicious Documentary History of Mexican cinema, the researcher Emilio Garc√≠a Riera writes the following comment: It's funny the outcome of this tropical melodrama. David Silva feels incestuous by simple solidarity with her former lover Maria Luisa Zea and that makes him give up of a Meche Barba more \\"femme fatal\\" than ever. In the microcosm of the tropical cabaret, the director Alberto Gout discovered how the passions tragically collide with the revelations of kinship. At the same time, Gout was finding, for him and for the genre of Rumberas, the style that would give prosperity in the coming years.Pel√≠culas Pepito: Humo en los ojos (1946) The film was originally offered to the Cuban-Mexican rumbera Mar√≠a Antonieta Pons. As the producer(s) and Pons did not reach a salary agreement, the producer Alfonso Rosas Priego and the director Alberto Gout began to test several other candidates. Among them were Lupita Torrentera, Yadira Jimenez and Ethel Maklen, but eventually Meche Barba was chosen. Thanks to this film, Barba makes her foray into Rumbera films.

It was released by the Sun Record Company in 1969. Background In June 1969, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips sold the entire Sun catalog to Shelby Singleton, which included a treasure trove of unreleased Lewis recordings. With Jerry Lee's rebirth as a country star for Smash Records, Singleton began releasing these older songs and packaged them in such a way that many buyers assumed they were recent recordings. Under the terms of the deal between Singleton and Phillips, the Sun International Corporation was formed with Phillips as a minority share holder, ensuring that Phillips would continue to get a piece of the pie and that the Sun name would remain relevant. As Colin Escott observes in his essay for the 1986 retrospective The Killer: The Smash/Mercury Years, \\"After only seeing two Sun albums by Jerry Lee Lewis between 1957 and 1969, the market was suddenly flooded with three or four a year and even more recycled into budget compilations on Pickwick Records.\\" Consequently, Lewis found himself competing with his own past, much like Johnny Cash, whose masters had also been a part of the Singleton/Phillips deal. Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following The Golden Cream of the Country with A Taste of Country later in 1970. \\"The Killer\\" was so hot in 1970 that Singleton issued one of Lewis's latter unreleased Sun recordings, \\"One Minute Past Eternity\\", as a single and it climbed to number two on the country chart, following on the heels of Lewis's recent Mercury smash \\"She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye\\".

Few elements such as the apse, the right wall, and some windows date to the original Gothic architecture style church. A major reconstruction between 1707 and 1727 created the present Baroque architecture structure and interior decoration. The simple brick facade differs from the elaborately decorative interior. The stucco were completed Antonio Milli; the ceiling medallions were frescoed with Saints Francis, Anthony of Padua and Giuseppe da Copertino, by Lucantonio Angiolucci. The Vitelli chapel on the left was designed (circa 1550) by Giorgio Vasari. He painted the large canvas depicting the Coronation of the Virgin (1563). The altar of St Joseph in the church has now a copy of the original Marriage of the Virgin (1504) by Raphael, stolen by Napoleonic troops in 1798, and now in the Pinacoteca di Brera. The 14th century carved altar is attributed to Franciscan Beato Giacomo.

Fellow SETP. Member of the French Acad√©mie de l'air et de l'espace.  Life  Wilfried ‚ÄúFred‚Äù Baron von Engelhardt was born in the Castle of Liebenberg (north of Berlin, Germany) as the great-grandson of F√ºrst Philip zu Eulenburg. Through his step-father, C.A. von Schoenbeck, who flew as a pilot in WW I in the famous squadron of the ‚ÄûRed Baron‚Äú and who was later the Commander of the German Flight Test Center in Rechlin, Fred early on developed a passion for aviation. Young Fred often met with famous German pilots - Hanna Reitsch and Ernst Udet to name a few. While his step-father frequently piloted a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch and would sometimes land on the Castle's estate, Fred got attached to helicopters. Back then helicopters were in their infancy. The rotorcraft aerodynamics, not well understood these days, the much more complex mechanism as such and the versatility of helicopters attracted him more than fixed wing aircraft. Nevertheless, Fred started out fixed wing. At age 16 he was trained as a glider pilot ‚Äì the first step towards a seat in a fighter aircraft of the German Luftwaffe. Fred was trained on SG38 and Grunay Baby. He earned his wings in the ‚ÄúKranich‚Äù. By October 1944 he held the A,B and C-privileges in his Glider license. Towards the end of the WWII he continued training and was supposed to fly the Heinkel He 162 ‚ÄúVolksj√§ger‚Äù. However, events turned. The lack of aviation fuel in the last days of the war forced Fred to stay out of the Heinkel. His family had to flee to Austria after the war had ended and Fred earned his high school diploma in Linz in 1947. He would definitely have opted for an aerospace program; however; the Allies banned courses on aeronautical engineering at German and Austrian universities. Fred completed a training to become hotel manager instead. At the time his step-father had the German dealership for Hiller Helicopters. Fred moved to Paris, was taught French at Sorbonne and eventually became an aircraft mechanic. This likely was the most important step towards his professional career as a test pilot. From 1955 to 1956 Fred then worked as an aircraft mechanic in the Netherlands. It was a small enterprise and he lived on a very small salary. In return, he was allowed to fly the Hiller 12B and eventually became the first commercial helicopter pilot in the Netherlands and Germany. His log book shows his first flight in a Hiller H12B, registration PH-NFL, on August 2, 1954 (Fred had flown fixed wing aircraft before, mainly gliders and ‚Äì not official - his step-father's ‚ÄúFieseler Storch‚Äù. When starting official fixed wing flight training his flight instructor would let him solo after only 20 minutes of dual instruction). Fred progressed to flight instructor in 1956 in Paris and earned his living as a flight instructor, for both civilian and military pilots, flying Bell 47 and Djinn helicopters until 1960. Looking at his flight log the next step in his career brought him to Dutch New-Guinea. He worked there as an operational helicopter pilot from September 26, 1961 to August 3, 1962. In these days Fred worked for S.G.O.N.N.G., flying the Aloutte II to remote locations in a remote part of the world. Because of his technical background Fred was invited to join the newly created group around Ludwig B√∂lkow. His mentor was the engineer Hans Derschmidt, a member of the B√∂lkow group who developed a swept rotor system with variable sweep and who recommended Engelhardt to the company owner Mr. Boelkow (‚Äúhe is not only a pilot ‚Äì he also has some solid understanding of helicopter technology‚Äù). Boelkow was in need for a test pilot for his Bo 46 project (the Bo 46 employed a novice rotor concept with variable sweep main rotor blades so to achieve higher speeds in forward flight. After his inventor this rotor system is named ‚ÄúDerschmidt Rotor‚Äù). Fred went to Test Pilot School in Istres. In his spare time on weekends he tested French helicopters as a volunteer and graduated as best of class on July 1, 1966 with test pilot certificate No 31. He served as the Chief Test pilot at MBB from 1962 to 1973. After his career as a test pilot Fred worked as Head of Sales, then Head of Customer Training. This position took him into many parts of the world, among other, Africa and Middle East and he would now pass on his knowledge to younger pilots.  First flights  Wilfried ‚ÄúFred‚Äù von Engelhardt's First Flights: * Experimental Helicopter B√∂lkow Bo 46 ‚Äì testing the swept blade rotor system. First attempt to lift off was on February 14, 1964. This helicopter (only one was flown) is now located in the Rotorcraft Museum in B√ºckeburg, Germany. * Utility Helicopter Bo 105 ‚Äì flight testing the hingeless rotor system. This helicopter is a success story and does not need further introduction. First attempt to lift off was on September 14, 1966 in the Bo 105 V1. The prototype was lost when it entered ground resonance. Fred emerged uninjured and was quoted ‚Äúthat he had lots of room to exit the helicopter‚Äù. First flight was on February 16, 1967. According to Fred's logbook this flight lasted from 17:04 to 17:24 LT and was a success.  Other flights of interest  * On July 23, 1957 (Flight #155) when flying the Djinn helicopter on a spraying mission in the Netherlands his helicopter collided with a wire which was not removed by accident. The helicopter looped around the wire and crash landed. Fred emerged with some minor injuries - and got to know the farmer's daughter who assisted in home care and would then become his first wife. * June 22, 1967: first flight in Alouette III with main rotor blades manufactured from reinforced fibers (GFK) * September 30, 1960 to October 4, 1960: flights in Bell 47G for the movie ‚ÄûWeisses R√∂ssl‚Äú * November 13, 1967: Flight #1544: first flight with rotor head manufactured from titanium in Bo 105V2 * January 8, 1968, Flight # 1568: Flight with wounded tail rotor * May 13, 1969 (Flight# 1832): High speed flight testing with Bo 105 V4, registration D-HAPE. The perplex canopy burst into pieces, wounding the flight test engineer and tearing off Fred's helmet. * September 16, 1969 (Flight# 1895): Emergency landing after failure of the tail rotor control while on a demonstration flight with a Canadian pilot. * August 10, 1970 (Flight# 2022): Demonstration flight in Bo 105 with Neil Armstrong * May 24, 1972 (Flight# 2105): Engine failure overflying S√£o Paulo, Brasil, in a Jet Ranger. Successful autorotation to the ground.  Achievements  Together with Sigi Hoffmann, Fred was the first holder of an instrument rating for helicopters in Germany. Fred has held SETP functions in the European part of the society in the past. Despite of his high age he showed great interest in the activities of the society.  Last flights  Wilfried ‚ÄúFred‚Äù von Engelhardt's Last Flights * On February 5, 2013 Fred flew a Bo 105 for his last time from Linz to Salzburg and back (Log Book #2344 and #2345), where he gave a speech on development of the Bo 105 on invitation by ‚ÄúFlying Bulls‚Äù. * On April 15, 2014 he was on controls in an EC 135 full motion flight simulator in Donauw√∂rth on invitation by Airbus Helicopters. After his retirement Wilfried dedicated himself to helping people, in particular those who were disabled. He was an active member in Church and developed and supported an S.O.S Kinderdorf for homeless children. Fred took courses in theology at Linz University and completed an education as a medical professional in Traditional Chinese Medicine. He was very active in the field of anthropology as well.

He was a great warrior and expansionist. He had a strong army known as the \\"Inkingi\\" (pillar). One of his military camps, known as \\"Iziruguru\\", was attacked by a people called \\"Abanyabungo\\" from the western Kivu in the modern-day Congo. Kigeli II attacked chiefdoms in eastern Congo, including Bishugi, Kamuronsi, Gishali, Buhunde, Buzi, and Tongo (Masisi). He was stopped by thick rain forests from proceeding further into Congo. He redirected his expansionist attacks into western Uganda, around Lake Edward, and stopped at the \\"rock of Kabasha\\" (urutare rwa Kabasha) and marked it as the then border between Rwanda and Busongora. Busongora was also known as the land of the Bacwezi. It was against Rwandan customary law to attack Busongora as it was believed to be the home of the god Ryangombe. He attacked and conquered chiefdoms of Buberuka and confiscated their drum known as \\"Icyungo\\" and attacked Kigezi and Bushengero where he came upon a unique variety of beans cultivated in Rwanda to this day and which supplanted the indigenous type that was known as \\"Ibiharo\\". He also confiscated from Bunyoro a breed of goats known as \\"Ihene z'Akamenesho\\". These goats were large and were assigned special care. A tradition of goat show and parade was introduced at the palace until the reign of Yuhi V Musinga during whose time a caretaker named Bunyereri wa Muhozi from Gishubi in Gitarama was the goats' shepherd. During Kigeli II Nyamuheshera's reign, parts of Rwanda were under occupation by neighboring kingdoms. Some of the areas effected were the territories of Bwanacyambwe, which had been confiscated by a king known as Kimenyi II Shumbusho, and the territories of Gisaka and Ndorwa, found in modern parts of north western Tanzania and south western Uganda. Kigeli II's opportunity to attack and reclaim Bwanacyambwe and Gisaka arose when the teenage king of Ndorwa, Gahaya I Rutindageli, initiated a conflict against his cousin, the teenage king of Gisaka, Kimenyi III Rwahasha. These two kings were still too young to rule in their own right, so their mothers ruled on their behalf. Ndorwa's queen mother, Nyiragahaya I, went to war against Nyirakimenyi III Kabonde of Gisaka on behalf of their sons. The fight took palace at Muzizi near Lake Muhazi. The Ndorwa aggressors defeated Queen Nyirakimenyi III of Gisaka. Nyirakimenyi suffered a humiliating defeat. She was captured and had her breasts cut off by her inlaw Nyiragahaya I. Gisaka's teenage King Kimenyi III was a nephew of Bwanacyambwe's King Kimenyi II Shumbusho. After his mother's horrific defeat, the people of Gisaka and Bwanacyambwe's king Kimenyi II requested Rwandan King Kigeli II Nyamuheshera (their former nemesis) to help hide the teenage king and lend them military power to drive Ndorwa Queen Nyiragahaya I out of Gisaka. Kigeli II agreed on condition that King Kimenyi return the territory of Bwanacyambwe to the Kingdom of Rwanda. Kimenyi II agreed to Kigeli II's condition. The two set off and launched a combined army against Queen Nyiragahaya I's army. The Ndorwa army was defeated on the first attack and the Kingdom of Rwanda regained its territory of Bwanacyambwe. At that point, Kigeli II Nyamuheshera spared King Kimenyi II & III's lives and refrained from capturing the territory of Gisaka, as it was under a boy king. It was dishonorable in Rwandan tradition to attack and conquer a kingdom whose king was still a child. Instead Gisaka became a Rwandan protectorate. It was to fully become part of Rwanda a few centuries later during the reign of Rwabugili IV. Kigeli II Nyamuheshera's reign is also marked by the death of his queen, Nyirakigeli II Ncenderi, by suicide after she suspected that she was pregnant through adultery. Queen Nyirakigeli II Ncenderi was buried at Butangampundu, a special burial place for Rwandan kings, queens, and royals that were suspected to have died as a result of suicide. Kigeli II Nyamuheshera was buried at Burenga near Shayo in Byumba. He had a medal of honor known as \\"Umudende\\" for defeating seven foreign kings.

History drawing of Alessandro Nave, 1699 The Citt√† di Castello Municipal gallery is housed in the renaissance-style Vitelli alla Cannoniera Palace, home to the condottiere Alessandro Vitelli, grandson of Niccol√≤ Vitelli, and wife Angela Paola de‚Äô Rossi, nephew of Giovanni delle Bande Nere. It is among the main public art galleries in Italy, and documents art from the 13th to 20th centuries, focusing on Renaissance art, and the very early works by Raphael and Luca Signorelli. The collection is composed mainly by paintings derived from religious institutions suppressed in the 19th century after Italian unification, and also reflects the patronage of Vitelli family, prominent allies of Medici. Donations to the collection of later works, up to the 20th century, expanded the collections. Palazzo Vitelli alla Cannoniera Construction of the palace occurred mainly between 1521 and 1532, and completed in 1545 for the marriage between Alessandro Vitelli and Paola de‚Äô Rossi. The palace faces a garden, that in the 16th century was famous in Europe due to its collection of exotic plants. In 1907, Elia Volpi, a local manager and artist who had previously worked on the restoration of the Palazzo Davanzati in Florence, acquired and restored this palace, donating it in 1912 for the city to house the Municipal Art Gallery. Banner of the Holiest Trinity (back, Creation of Eve) by Raphael The main fa√ßade is decorated with graphic scenes painted by Cristoforo Gherardi to Giorgio Vasari‚Äôs design, with clear references to the names of the commissioners and their coats of arms, the palm of Vitelli and the roaring lion of Rossi, among rich decorative motifs of the 15th century as vases, masks and alchemic elements. The rooms are also richly decorated by Gherardi and Cola Dell‚ÄôAmatrice, called by the Vitelli to celebrate the resident couple and the military prowess of the family, with vivid mythological places and some elegant figurations of pets, symbol of the domestic ambient. A monumental staircase which leads to the first floor with paintings depicting prince Apollo and all of the muses of arts, inspired by Ovid‚Äôs Metamorphoses. Painting Collection The oldest works in the collection are 13th century gilded works such as the majestic panel with Enthroned Madonna and Child with Six Angels by the Master of Citt√† di Castello, a follower of Duccio di Boninsegna. The main collection includes Renaissance masterworks that highlight the connections of the Vitelli with Medici. The museum offers a number of Luca Signorelli works, from works that show the strong influence of Piero della Francesca, to his Martyrdom of St Sebastian, and a privileged view of the first activity of Raphael, who reached the status of \\"master\\" working in the city, as notable in the two facades of Standard of the Holiest Trinity, the only one work left in Citt√† di Castello, which many critics consider his first work. Other Florentine works include Domenico Ghirlandaio's Coronation of the Virgin and rich mannerism paintings by Raffaellino del Colle, Pomarancio and other coeval artists. The 20th century section hosts creations by Giorgio de Chirico, Renato Guttuso, Mario Mafai, and Carlo Carr√†. In 2015 the Museum included a permanent collection of Nuvolo‚Äôs works, friend and colleague to Alberto Burri and global innovator in silk screen art. *Gothic art; Selected works (rooms I-II-III) **Enthroned Madonna and Child with six Angels by Master of Citt√† di Castello **Enthroned Madonna and Child by Spinello Aretino **Enthroned Madonna and Child by Andrea di Bartolo **San Bartolomeo Triptic by Antonio Alberti **Enthroned Madonna and Child by Antonio Vivarini *Local and Tuscan Renaissance; Selected works (rooms IV-V-VII) **Madonna and Child with two Angels by Neri di Bicci **Christ with the signs of the Passion by an unknown 15th Century painter **Coronation of the Virgin by Domenico Ghirlandaio and workshop **Annunciation and All Saint‚Äôs Altarpiece by Francesco Tifernate *Renaissance/ Raphael in Citt√† di Castello; Selected works (room VI) **Banner of the Holy Trinity, front The Trinity with Saints Sebastian and Roch, back Creation of Eve by Raphael *Renaissance/ Luca Signorelli in Citt√† di Castello; Selected works (rooms XII, XIII) **Saint Paul by Luca Signorelli **Martyrdom of St Sebastian by Signorelli **Banner of Saint John Baptist: front Saint John, back Christ Baptism **Santa Cecilia Altarpiece by Luca Signorelli and workshop *Tuscan and Roman Mannerism; Selected works (rooms XVI-XVII-XVIII) **Annunciation by Raffaellino del Colle **Deposition and Madonna and Child with Saints by Jacopo di Giovanni Francesco **The laying of hands by Peter and John by Santi di Tito **Immaculate Conception by Nicol√≤ Circignani, known as Pomarancio *From Seventeenth to Nineteenth Century; Selected works (rooms VI-XIX-XX) **Two Saints by Giovanni Battista Pacetti **Saint Nicholas of Tolentino by Ermenegildo Costantini **Domine quo vadis? by Francesco Mancini **Madonna and Child, by Tommaso Conca **Madonna and Child by Vincenzo Chialli *Twentieth Century; Selected works **Italy‚Äôs square by Giorgio De Chirico **Still life by Renato Guttuso **Seascape by Carlo Carr√† **Group in restaurant by Mario Mafai **permanent collection by Nuvolo Sculpture and decorative arts The sculpture section exhibits pieces from late Roman and middle age fragments to a notable group of terracotta by Andrea della Robbia and his workshop, which confirms the important Florentine influence on the area.

Many scientific activities were hosted as the important restoration of Raphael banner in 2005, for the London National Gallery exhibition about the early production of the artist. Between history and legend (Sora Laura) Palazzo Vitelli alla Cannoniera has always been linked to the popular legend of Laura, or rather ‚ÄúSora Laura‚Äù, who‚Äôs been said the lover of Alessandro Vitelli who preferred her to his wife. Bored for the frequent absence of the husband at war, she seemingly attracted good looking young men into her clutches by dropping a lace-edged handkerchief into the street and then killing them in a still existing, exit inside the building. In 2006, the artist Milo Manara paid his homage to this legendary woman.

Biography Ariel Kalmanowicz was born in Paris and learned to play recorder and saxophone as a youth. He studied computer science in college, and while at university he met Salvatore Adamo, who soon hired Kalma into his touring band on a world tour as a saxophonist and flautist. While on the road with Adamo, he met Baden Powell, with whom he would collaborate in France and Germany in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Around this time, he made experimental tape pieces using his own recorded instruments, found sounds, church organs, and poetry. In 1974 he took a one way plane to in India, learning rudimentary classical Indian music and developing an interest in meditative and drone music. He was also influenced by American minimalist music. In 1975, he recorded and self-released an album, Le Temps des Moissons while working at the GRM studio of INA Pierre Henry in Paris. His 1978 album Osmose features Borneo rainforest nature sounds recorded by Richard Tinti. Kalma's output increased over the 1980s and 1990s, and his discography now runs to several dozen albums. In 2014, his 1970s work was collected by RVNG and a compilation, An Evolutionary Music, was released. This album reached #9 on the Billboard New Age albums chart in 2015.

He is best known for \\"Spring River in the Flower Moon Night\\" (Chun Jiang Hua Yue Ye, Êò•Ê±üËä±ÊúàÂ§ú), one of the most unique and influential Tang poems, which has inspired numerous later artworks. Life Zhang Ruoxu was a native of Yangzhou in modern Jiangsu province, and served as a minor military officer in Yanzhou in modern Shandong. Little is known about his life today. He is traditionally grouped with He Zhizhang, Zhang Xu, and Bao Rong as the Four Poets of Central Wu (), the Lower Yangtze region. Poetry Only two of Zhang Ruoxu's poems are extant, but one of them, \\"Spring River in the Flower Moon Night\\" (Chun Jiang Hua Yue Ye, Êò•Ê±üËä±ÊúàÂ§ú), has long been well known and considered an extraordinary work. The poem can be divided into nine quatrains and three sections. The first section describes the scenery of the moonlit Yangtze River in spring. The second and third lament the ephemerality of life, as well as the sorrow of travellers and the loved ones they leave behind. The poem marks a stylistic break from the poetry of the preceding Six Dynasties, and anticipates the content and style of High Tang poetry. Legacy One of the most unique poems of the Tang dynasty, \\"Spring River in the Flower Moon Night\\" is included in virtually all historical surveys of Tang poetry. The influential 20th-century poet Wen Yiduo was especially enthusiastic in his praise, calling it \\"the poem of all poems, the summit of all summits.\\" Zhang Ruoxu's poem has inspired numerous later artworks. The composer Peng Xiuwen created a piece of orchestral music with the same name, which has since entered the classical repertoire for the traditional Chinese instrument guzheng. During the Lantern Festival of 2013, calligrapher Wang Dongling () gave a live calligraphy performance at the Hong Kong Museum of Art, creating a high by wide work of Spring River in the Flower Moon Night. It was the largest work of calligraphy made in Hong Kong, and has been donated to the art museum.

It came out weekly during the school year, and fortnightly/monthly during the summer. It was distributed on newsstands and in over three thousand schools.Gianni Bono. Guida al fumetto italiano. Volume II. Epierre, 2003. pp. 1694-1697. The magazine alternated topical headings and curiosity columns, short stories and serials, games, articles on school or teaching topics and comics. Some important Italian cartoonists collaborated to the magazine, including Luciano Bottaro (who here introduced the Pon Pon character), Franco Aloisi, Giovan Battista Carpi, Giulio Chierchini, Paolo Piffarerio, Gallieno Ferri, Guido Zamperoni. In addition to humorous and adventurous comics, in deference to the educational function of the magazine, there were published numerous comics which adapted famous novels, biographies and historical events. Given to a sales crisis, in January 1970 the magazine changed name to Lo Scolaro D'Europa ('The Schoolboy of Europe') and started mainly publishing previously published material, but the new course was short lived and the magazine finally closed in May 1972 after a sixty-year history and more than 1,000 issues published.

It is located about 20 km from Bengaluru off Kanakapura Road. It is 13 km from Banashankari and can be overseen from the NICE road. Entry inside the park has been banned for vehicles, however, it has become a hot spot for cyclists. It has a nice view and a small Shani temple on top of a rocky hill. As of today, Thurahalli forest is said to be Bengaluru's only surviving forest. Rocks in the forest provide one of the few outdoor bouldering opportunities to the cities residents and have multiple established routes. Wildlife = Flora = The majority of trees are eucalyptus. During August, the orchids (Habenaria roxburghii) bloom, giving a brilliant white colour to contrast the green of the forest. The rocky terrains are great for lianas, the most common being Opilia amentacea. They bloom during the summer. These are mostly located in the Northern edge of the forest, surrounded by figs (Ficus tinctoria), nerale-mara (Syzygium cumini) and rocks. The most common herb is the Byttneria herbacea. It blooms throughout the year. Its flowers attract many beetles. Legumes, specifically Indigofera karnatakana are found here. Ixora pavetta bloom during the summer. They have an intoxicating fragrance. = Fauna = Many animals can be spotted, including spotted deer, wild boar, hares, jackals, lizards, mongooses, etc. Turahalli is also famous for its bird population, which includes rare jungle birds like Eagle-owl, Sirkeer malkoha, common flameback woodpecker, and blue rock thrush, in addition to relatively common jungle birds like peafowl, green bee-eater, paradise flycatcher, white- throated fantail flycatcher, jungle babbler, rufous treepie, black drongo, white-breasted kingfisher, pond heron, spotted dove, purple-rumped sunbird, oriental white-eye, barn swallow, red-rumped swallow, small minivet, white- browed bulbul, red-vented bulbul, common iora, oriental magpie robin; birds of the plains like rufous-tailed lark and pied bushchat, in addition to common urban birds like house crows, jungle crows, common mynas, black kites, brahminy kites, blue rock pigeons, Asian koels, and more. Activities Turahalli offers excellent biking trails. It is also among the few places within the city for natural rock climbing in addition to Avathi and Raogodlu. Rocks are granite, with various sizes and shapes. Many climbers practice regularly, in preparation for local or international competitions. https://www.mountainproject.com/area/113984786/ravugodluhttps://www.avathi.comhttps://www.mountainproject.com/area/114277934/avathi Endangerment The forest is the last one surviving in Bengaluru. It has slowly been encroached upon. It has also been used as an illegal garbage dump, which has negatively affected the wildlife. Frequent fires during the summers, both natural and those caused by locals, have significantly impacted certain species of plants that grow in this forest. The BBMP also opened a sewage treatment plant near the forest. There is also a problem with poaching. Land has also been illegally cleared to grow crops. Over the past few years, efforts have been made by nearby residents to clean up and to prevent further encroachment and dumping of waste in the forest.

Taylor has won multiple National and International poetry slams, including the 2004 U.S. National Individual Poetry Slam competition, the 2005 DC/Baltimore Grand Slam competition, the 2007 Ill List III Slam competition, the 2006 Four Continents International Slam competition and has performed for audiences across the US, New Zealand, Australia, England, Scotland, Sweden, Canada and the Netherlands, including in prisons, mental health treatment facilities, homeless shelters, universities, festivals and public schools across the globe. She is an African-American woman who identifies as queer.  Spoken word as hip hop  While hip hop is traditionally thought of in terms of music, graffiti, break dancing, and deejaying it also includes other creative forms like film, spoken word, autobiographies, literature and journalism. Hip hop began as a creative way to express complicated emotions surrounding the experience of being marginalized and oppressed, and as a source of activism. The notions of claiming space for the self and one's community and expressing your agency through having a voice and opinions are central themes in the creation of hip hop. Hip hop has roots in African traditions and art, incorporating rhythms and storytelling, using a combination of the human voice and instruments. Spoken word specifically is a \\"deeply rooted tradition that has manifested itself in a stream of poets that have served as clarifiers of the 'ultimate realities' that Black people face.\\" In her work, Taylor sets out telling a story that makes the reader or listener wonder and question about the meaning of the work, challenging their understanding of the themes or topics they just took in. She has written articles about the intersections of race and gender on the topic of body positivity,critiquing the current ideas society has around the movement, making it more inclusive and claiming space for those who have been noticeably left out of the conversation. > \\"Our society tells us fatness is not beautiful. Blackness is not beautiful. > So even while reclaiming size diversity as beautiful, the presence of > Blackness complicates the narrative...It is this unwillingness to wade > through the murky waters of race that make Black and Brown women invisible > even in the places where we say we are trying to make people seen.\\"  The Body Is Not An Apology Movement This movement is about fostering \\"global, radical, unapologetic self love which translates to radical human love and action in service toward a more just, equitable and compassionate world\\". It strives to reduce violence against people who have been marginalized and had violence perpetuated against them, including > \\"...racist violence including lynching, slavery, holocausts, and internment > camps...LGBTQIA people being assaulted, murdered and driven to suicide > regularly...rape and sexual assault...the bombing of abortion clinics and > the murder of physicians supporting women‚Äôs rights to autonomy over their > own bodies...involuntary sterilization of people with > disabilities...debilitating shame that people around the world live with as > a result of the psychological attacks our social and media machines wage > against us, ending in bulimia and anorexia, addiction, stigma, racism, > homophobia, ableism, sizeism, ageism, transphobia, mass self-hatred, and > senseless violence as a result of body hatred.\\" The movement has also come out with the RUHCUS Project (Radically Unapologetic Healing Challenge 4 Us), an exercise that takes place over 30 days aimed at helping people in their goal of body empowerment. The medium that their movement uses to get their message out is Facebook, Tumblr, and their website . These sites are all very accessible to a wide audience, including those with vision impairments. All of their posts include captions describing the picture so someone using narration technology would still be able to get a similar experience to other people using the sites. Their posts are also about a large variety of subjects, with topics like weight/size, disability, sexuality, gender, mental health, race, aging, rad parents, men, global, intersections, and \\"H\\", a section that stands for \\"handle that\\", a more radically inclusive version of the phrase \\"man up.\\"  Works  In 2010 Taylor released her first book, A Little Truth on Your Shirt, a collection of her poetry that has been described as challenging, asking the reader hard questions. She was included in several different anthologies, including Elephant Engine High Dive Revival, Junkyard Ghost Revival Anthology, Just Like a Girl: A Manifesta, Spoken Word Revolution Redux, Growing Up Girl: An Anthology of Voices from Marginalized Spaces. She was also featured in various journals and magazines including Domain Magazine, Reality Magazine, Off Our Backs, The City Morgue, and X Magazine. She's made appearances on networks like MTV, BET, TVOne, Oxygen Network, CNN, PBS, and NPR as well as on HBO's Def Poetry Jam.
