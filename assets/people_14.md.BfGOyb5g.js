Okonkwo was a Major in the Biafran Army Medical Corps. He was trained as a physician in the United States, and was married to an American. Life Okonkwo was a medical doctor and was the CO of the Nigerian Armed Forces Medical Service in Benin right before the Civil War. At the onset of the war, he became one of the top ranked rebel commanders in the Mid-West region that later became briefly known as Republic of Benin by rebel leaders. On 9 August 1967 a force of 3,000 Biafran troops crossed the Niger bridge, with one group making a dash for Benin City. On 14 August the Biafran command in Enugu announced that Major Okonkwo had been appointed Military Administrator of the Mid-Western Region. The new administration faced resistance from several segments of the population. Morale was poor. The Liberation Army commander, a Yoruba colonel named Victor Banjo, and three majors were later discovered to have been negotiating with the Nigerian army, were tried for high treason and executed by firing squad in Enugu. The Nigerian Army regrouped and advanced towards Benin city under the leadership of Colonel Murtala Mohammed, recapturing the city on 20 September 1967. The day before, Okonkwo had been declared Governor of the \\"autonomous, independent and sovereign republic of Benin\\". In his broadcast declaring the independent Republic of Benin, Okonkwo belatedly tried to rally non-Igbo groups. After the city fell, Okonkwo was thought to have fled to Ibo areas near Ubiaja.

The organization advocated biomass fuels (especially wood pellets) over fossil fuels. In order to promote sustainability and reduce the expense of home heating for impoverished Vermonters, VSHI installed pellet stoves in low-income houses at no cost. VSHI also advocated for the sustainable development of local biomass sources for fuel. History In 2007 a group of students from Mount Abraham Union High School prepared a presentation on the subject of grass energy in Vermont.https://web.archive.org/web/20190207191438/http://www.sustainableheatingvt.org/ This presentation discussed both the environmental and economic impact that grass-derived biomass fuels would have on the Vermont economy.https://docs.google.com/present/view?skipauth=true&browserok;=true&id;=dd3n93t4_36q3q6k9 As of 2008 VSHI morphed from a loose coalition of students and educators to a state-registered nonprofit corporation.

Listed at 5' 4\\", 134 lb., she batted left-handed and threw right-handed.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary – W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Richard spent eight seasons in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. A six-time All-Star, she also was a member of four champion teams. Richard made a transition from outfield to catcher, which enabled her to utilize her strong throwing arm more effectively, and she responded by gunning down more baserunners than any catcher in the league. Basically a line-drive hitter, she posted a .241 career batting average in 725 games, driving in 287 runs while scoring 237. As a catcher, she committed only 134 errors in 3,407 total chances for a .961 career fielding average.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Early life A native of Argus, Pennsylvania, Richard grew up on a family farm in the Ridge Valley Creek area and played softball for the Sellersville-Perkasie high school team. After graduating in 1946, she attended an AAGPBL tryout held in Allenton. She impressed by her throwing arm, range and potential. AAGPBL career In 1947 she was allocated to the Grand Rapids Chicks, a team managed by former big leaguer Johnny Rawlings. That season the league moved its spring training camp to Havana, Cuba, and Richard was one of the two hundred girls who made the trip. The Chicks won the league title in 1947, with Richard patrolling 47 games at right field and making three appearances as relief pitcher. Richard started 1948 with the Rockford Peaches, but the team turned her into a full- time catcher and she went on to have a solid career. With Richard behind the plate, Rockford earned six playoff berths between 1948 and 1953, including three championship titles in a row from 1948 through 1950. In that year, she hit .251 for the Peaches but fractured an ankle in the season's final game and missed the playoffs, being replaced by Marilyn Jones. Since 1949 Richard made six consecutive all-star squads until the folding of the league in 1954, in which she hit a career-high seven home runs. One of the most memorable experience of her career came in 1949 while on an AAGPBL tour of Central and South America. The team was welcomed by both government officials and commoners. In Nicaragua, they visited the presidential palace and were greeted by the then President Anastasio Somoza.Biographical Dictionary of American Sports – David L. Porter. Publisher: Greenwood Press, 2000. Format: Hardcover, 2064pp. Language: English. Allington All-Stars Once the league disbanded, Richard toured with an All-Star team led by former Rockford manager Bill Allington. Several former AAGPBL players were selected by Allington to the national touring team known as the All-American All-Stars. The team played 100 games from 1954 through 1957, each booked in a different town, against male semi-pro teams, while the girls traveled over 10,000 miles in the manager's station wagon and a Ford Country Sedan. Besides Richard, the Allington All- Stars included players as Joan Berger, Gloria Cordes, Jeanie Descombes, Gertrude Dunn, Betty Foss, Mary Froning, Jean Geissinger, Katie Horstman, Maxine Kline, Dolores Lee, Magdalen Redman, Dorothy Schroeder, Jean Smith, Dolly Vanderlip and Joanne Weaver, among others.Ohio Women's Hall of Fame - Katie Horstman biography Life after baseball Following her baseball career, Richard worked in AMETEK, Inc for 26 years until her retirement in 1993.

Essentially a talk show, it also has a competitive element. In each 60 minute episode, three prominent public figures from different walks of life give their views and debate on five issues arising from the top news stories of the previous week. The program is broadcast live before a studio audience, with the viewers at home voting by telephone for the winning speaker. The results of the tele-voting are displayed throughout the show, and one caller is randomly selected each week to receive a cash prize.Krajina, Zlatan, \\"Democratic Potentials of Media Entertainment: Reading ‘The Pyramid’\\", Political Thought: Croatian Political Science Review, Issue 5, 2007 Željka Ogresta, presenter of The Pyramid History The show is written and presented by the well-known Croatian television personality, Željka Ogresta, whose husband, Dubravko Merlić (head of Castor Multimedia) conceived the format. The first episode was broadcast on 31 October 2004 with opera singer Sandra Bagarić, sociologist Aleksandar Štulhofer and politician Dragan Primorac announced as the contestants.Index.hr, \\"HTV uzvraća udarac: Vraćaju se Željka Ogresta i Dubravko Merlić\\", 19 October 2004 According to HRT's statistics the first season averaged 61,539 callers per episode.Quoted on The Pyramid Show: Highlights (official web site) The Pyramid won a 2007 Rose d'Or award for Best Live Show,Rose d'Or Festival 2007 winners and has inspired several localized versions in the region including those in Serbia (started in 2005), Bosnia and Herzegovina (started in 2007), Bulgaria (started in 2007), Macedonia (started in 2007), and Montenegro (started in 2007).The Pyramid Show: Markets (official web site) The Slovenian version, which started in 2006, is presented by Erika Žnidaršič and broadcast on RTV Slovenija.Radiotelevizija Slovenija, \\"Zlata vrtnica za oddajo Piramida\\", 10 May 2007 There was also a Canadian version, La joute (The Joust), presented by Stéphan Bureau and broadcast by Télé-Québec.La joute: Présentation (Quote: \\"D'après le concept croate Piramida, La Joute propose un jeu débat hebdomadaire.\\") La joute ran for two seasons but was discontinued after the 2009/2010 season when the ratings had dropped 40% from the previous season.Dumas, Hugo, \\"Fini La joute, Bluff et Les moquettes coquettes\\", La Presse, 3 April 2010 Format Each season consists of three cycles, organized like a quiz show, with so called \\"levels\\". In each cycle, the winning speakers from each of the first 9 rounds move to the second level of the pyramid. Those winners then compete at the third and top level which determines the champion of that cycle. The champions of each of the three cycles then compete in the 40th and final episode of the season, the \\"Super Pyramid\\". The debates in each episode are tightly structured. Each of the news issues is introduced by a thirty-second video followed by a nine-minute discussion. One guest starts the discussion and has one minute to introduce the debate, with no one allowed to interrupt. Then each of the remaining two guests gives their one-minute take on the issue. After the first speaker, each guest also has one \\"right of rebuttal\\", allowing them to interrupt the current speaker with an interjection lasting at most 30 seconds. When a speaker is interrupted, they have a further 60 seconds to respond. Once each speaker has been able to speak for 60 seconds without interruption, the discussion continues with the presenter asking questions of the three guests. The first speaker in the first three issues under debate is chosen by the order in which they signed for the show. The first speaker in the fourth debate is the one currently placed second in the tele-voting, while the first speaker in the fifth debate is the one currently placed last.The Pyramid Show: Rules (official web site) Željka Ogresta at the rehearsal Re-launching After several years of intermission The Pyramid was re-launched on 16 September 2014.

Early anthropologists sought theoretical insight from the perceived tensions between nature and culture. Later, the argument became framed by the question of whether the two entities function separately from one another, or if they were in a continuous biotic relationship with each other. In eastern society nature and culture are conceptualized as dichotomous (separate and distinct domains of reference). Some consider culture to be \\"man's secret adaptive weapon\\"Greenwood, David J and William A. Stini (1977) Nature, Culture, and Human History, New York: Harper and Row, 393–408 in the sense that it is the core means of survival. It has been observed that the terms \\"nature\\" and \\"culture\\" that can not necessarily be translated into non- western languages,Strathern 1980 for example, the Native American John Mohawk describing \\"nature\\" as \\"anything that supports life\\".Nelson, Melissa K., 2008, Original Instructions: Indigenous Teachings for a Sustainable Future, Rochester: Collective Heritage Institute It has been suggested that small scale-societies can have a more symbiotic relationship with nature. But less symbiotic relations with nature are limiting small-scale communities' access to water and food resources. It was also argued that the contemporary Man- Nature divide manifests itself in different aspects of alienation and conflicts.Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel (2014). \\"Sustainability and Contemporary Man-Nature Divide: Aspects of Conflict, Alienation, and Beyond\\", Consilience: The Journal of Sustainable Development 13(1), 125-146. Greenwood and Stini argue that agriculture is only monetarily cost-efficient because it takes much more to produce than one can get out of eating their own crops, e.g. \\"high culture cannot come at low energy costs\\".Braun and Castree 1998 During the 1960s and 1970s Sherry Ortner showed the parallel between the divide and gender roles with women as nature and men as culture.Sherry Ortner (1972) Is Female to Male as Nature is to Culture?, Feminist Studies 1(2): 5-31 The nature–culture divide is deeply intertwined with the social versus biological debate, since it both are implications of each other. As viewed in earlier forms of Anthropology, it is believed that genetic determinism de-emphasizes the importance of culture, making it obsolete. However, more modern views show that culture is valued more than nature because everyday aspects of culture have a wider impact on how the humans see the world, rather than just our genetic makeup. Older anthropological theories have separated the two, such as Franz Boas, who claimed that social organization and behavior is purely the transmission of social norms and not necessarily the passing of hereditable traits. Instead of using such a contrasting approach, more modern anthropologists see Neo-Darwinism as an outline for culture, therefore nature is essentially guiding how culture develops. When looking at adaptations. anthropologists such as Daniel Nettle believe that behavior associated with cultural groups is a development of genetic difference between groups. Essentially, he states that animals choose their mates based on their environment, which is shaped by directly by culture. More importantly, the adaptations seen in nature are a result of evoked nature, which is defined as cultural characteristics which shape the environment and that then queue changes in phenotypes for future generations. To put simply, cultures that promote more effective resource allocation and chance for survival are more likely to be successful and produce more developed societies and cultures that feed off of each other. On the other hand, transmitted culture can be used to bridge the gap between the two even more, for it uses a trial and error based approach that shows how humans are constantly learning, and that they use social learning to influence individual choices. This is seen best about how the more superficial aspects of culture still are intertwined with nature and genetic variation. For example, there are beauty standards intertwined into the culture because they are associated with better survival rates, yet they also serve personal interests which allows for individual breeding pairs to understand how they fit into society. Additionally, cultural lags dissolve because it is not sustainable for reproduction, and cultural norms that benefit biology continue to persevere. By learning from each other, nature becomes more intertwined with culture since they reinforce each other. Since nature and culture are now viewed as more intertwined than ever before, which makes the divide between the two seems obsolete. Similarly, the social scientists have been reluctant to use biological explanations as explanations for cultural divisions because it is difficult to construct what \\"biological\\" explanations entail. According to social scientists like Emile Durkheim, anthropologists and especially sociologists have tended to characterize biological explanations in only a physiological and cognitive sense within individuals, not in a group setting. On the other hand, there is a heavier focus on the social determinism as seen in human behavior instead. Furthermore, even as divide between nature and culture has been narrowed there is a reluctance to define biological determinism on a large scale.

It grows in colonies in coastal forest areas of KwaZulu-Natal and marginally into Eastern Cape, South Africa. Description The stem is often multi branched and sparsely hairy, with lower stems becoming woody. The leaves are between 75 mm and 120 mm long, and are soft and often droop during dry conditions. The leaves have a velvety texture due to fine, dense hairs on the surface. These plants have a life cycle of about 7 to 10 years, after which they flower en masse and then die off. The flowers are produced in inflorescences and individual flowers are whitish in colour and about 8 mm in length. Ecological significance These plants form dense colonies in the understorey of forests where they provide food and shelter to many animals. Blue duiker and bushbuck feed on the leaves and shoots. The flowers attract many species of insects, and honey is said to be plentiful in years when these plants flower. Buckweed is excluded from areas of forest with dense tree cover and in turn plays a role in limiting forest regeneration as the tree seedling community beneath Isoglossa woodii shows reduced density and species richness from areas where I. woodii is absent.Griffiths, M., Lawes M. and Tsvuura, Z. (2005). Understorey gaps influence regeneration dynamics in subtropical coastal dune forest. University of KwaZulu-Natal Butterfly larvae of Protogoniomorpha parhassus and Celaenorrhinus mokeezi are known to feed on the leaves of Isoglossa.Williams, M. (1994). Butterflies of Southern Africa; A Field Guide. Etymology This plant was named after John Medley Wood (hence woodii). The common name of buckweed is a reference to these plants being abundant and being browsed by forest antelopes. Historical note John Medley Wood noted that \\"This plant does not flower every year; it is commonly believed to flower once in seven years only; this year, 1888, it has produced flowers in great abundance\\".http://www.aluka.org/action/showMetadata?doi=10.5555/AL.AP.FLORA.FLOC011538&pgs;=&cookieSet;=1 Gallery Image:Isoglossa_woodii_flowers.JPGflowering Isoglossa woodii Image:Isoglossa_woodii_flowers_close.JPGclose-up of the flowers Image:Isoglossa_woodii_seedlings.JPGseedlings and old stalks of I. woodii Image:Isoglossa_woodii_close_Pigeon_Valley_09_05_2010.JPGclose-up of the seedlings See also * Forests of KwaZulu-Natal * Maputaland-Pondoland- Albany Hotspot ReferencesBibliography * Pooley, E.

Today she is a floating Museum still undergoing restoration in Ramsgate, Kent.OS Explorer Map 150 - Norfolk Coast East. . Design and construction The Cervia design closely followed an early designed steam tug class called Foremost which had been conceived in 1923. The reasoning behind the recycling of this old design was due to Britain’s need to quickly replace losses, and because of the government’s rapid rebuilding programme. Using the best of pre- war tried and tested tug designs would avoid the need for new designs, and get round any delays to the Admiralties rebuild plans. Empire Raymond, as the Cervia was originally named, was part of the revised building programme ordered for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Europe on D-Day. In the event she was not completed until after the end of the Second World War. The tug was finished with many of the design features intended for the invasion. She had an armoured wheelhouse and gun emplacements installed. She weighed over 350 tons and was powered by a triple-expansion steam engine. Her boiler had been installed with oil burners but the design allowed for rapidly reverted to coal firing. All the ships that were ordered by the British government during the War period were given the prefix Empire which was the equivalent of the \\"Liberty Ship\\" building programme in the United States of America.Elphick, Peter. Liberty: The Ships that Won the War. Naval Institute Press, 2006. The Cervia is thought to be last Empire Ship surviving in the United Kingdom.The Empire Ships: Record of British-built and Acquired Merchant Ships During the Second World War: By Mitchell, William Harry: Publisher: LLP Professional Publishing; 2nd Revised edition (Oct 1990): History The Cervia was launched from the yard of Alexander Hall and Co. Ltdhttp://www.aberdeenships.com/sb_alexander_hall.asp in Aberdeen, Scotland, on 21 January 1946 and was handed to the Ministry of War Transport. In December 1946 she was sold on to the maritime towing business of William Watkins Ltd for the sum of £36,000. The business had purchased the tug using compensation it received for the vessels it lost on War service such as the tugs \\"Napia\\" and \\"Muria\\", which were sunk after collisions with mines near Ramsgate in 1939 and 1940. Name Change In 1947 the Empire Raymond name was changed to Cervia after the Italian Adriatic resort where the Watkins family owned a holiday villa. The name had previously been used on an earlier tug owned by William Watkins which taken part in the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 returning from there with 230 troops. Working life Whilst still known as the Empire Raymond the tug was employed with other tugs in the refurbishment of the Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth from her role as troop ship back to a passenger liner. During the working life of Cervia the main role that she was deployed in was as a towing and salvage tug between ports in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe. When based in Ramsgate \\"Cervia\\" helped free several vessels that had run aground on the Goodwin Sand Banks off of the East-Kent coast in the vicinity of Ramsgate and Deal. Her association with the port would continue for 60 years right up to the present time. Ramsgate The Cervia, along with other ships owned by Watkins, were regularly maintained and repaired at the workshops and slipways of Claxton’s Ltd in Ramsgate. Claxton’s was subsidiary of William Watkins. In 1950 William Watkins Ltd was merged with other companies to form Ship Towage Ltd of London. As part of this company’s fleet the Cervia was involved in a serious incident. Capsize On 25 October 1954 the Cervia was employed at Tilbury docks in London. Cervia was involved in the undocking of the P&O; liner , towing the liner stern first away from her landing stage. During this manoeuvre, the Arcadia had gone full ahead to avoid collision with liner P&O; liner . The resulting wash caused Cervia to be dragged over and capsize and sink.http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=42601 Despite their valiant efforts to release the towing hawser the Cervia Captain Russell, MBE and five of her crew died. Another Watkins owned tug, Challenge, managed to rescue three of the crew. The subsequent court of enquiry into the case, recorded that the deaths were accidental, and the sinking was caused by the failure of a quick release pin on her towing hook. On 28 October the Cervia herself became subject of a salvage operation. The tug was raised from the Thames riverbed and she was taken to Claxton’s Ltd in Ramsgate for a refit and then returned to service. On 27 January 1969 Cervia was at work on the Thames when her owners merged with W.H.J. Alexander & Company Ltd to form the London Tug Company. The London Tug Company was to have a policy to phase out steam tugs in favour of more modern diesel vessels. The modernization of the fleet went ahead at speed and by 1971 the Cervia was laid up at Sheerness. It was hoped a buyer could be found or the tug would go to the breakers. The Cervia was offered to a Michael List-Brain a potential buyer who wished to preserve her. The Board of London Tugs agreed to her sale \\"as is, where lies\\", for the sum of £3,500. Mr List-Brain purchased the ‘‘Cervia’’ in April 1973 and took possession at Poplar Docks, London where she had been laid up. The tug then was given a refit and was back in steam by the summer. Medway Maritime Museum She was used on the River Medway for both for pleasure trips and for her new owner to familiarize himself with her. It was envisaged that Cervia would become a part of a new organisation to be called \\"The Medway Maritime Museum\\". This was the idea of the United Kingdoms foremost ship preservationists, Martin Stevens. Unfortunately by 1974, the plans faltered when the Medway Council proved to be unable to provide sufficient funding for the project and with having neither premises nor any money the original museum project looked very precarious. Back to work With the fledgling museum’s lack of income, List-Brain and Stevens decided that one solution was to put the Cervia back to work in the towing business. At this time exploration in the North sea for gas and oil was begging to pick up in pace. This provided an ideal opportunity for the Cervia to earn her keep again. The Cervia was contracted to a construction firm based on the Medway. The construction firm of Howard Doris needed all manner of craft to assist with oil rig construction projects. In November 1974 Cervia to towed a crane barge to the Humber. She completed the contract with no problems, but with the cost of a very rapid re- equipping and complete lack of understanding as to the economics of marine towage meant the nett profit from this first towing contract was only £7.00. International Towing Ltd Following the contract with Howard Doris and the small profit, List-Brain and Stevens decided to put the fledgling business on a more professional business footing. A professional crew was employed and throughout 1975 several more successful towing contracts were undertaken by the Cervia all around the coast of the United Kingdom. During this time Cervia continued to prove her reliability working solidly for this twelve-month period except for a small period of time spent on essential boiler cleaning and maintenance. So successful was the business and the increasing demands placed on it, a proper company was set up which was called International Towing Ltd. ITL, as the company was abbreviated to, added three more steam tugs to her books to keep up with demand. These’s tugs were ST Hercules, ST Hero and ST Goliath. Ramsgate Like Watkins before them, International Towing Ltd. decided to choose Ramsgate as their home port. The knock on effect of these decisions gave a welcome boost to the local economy of Ramsgate which saw a resurgence of commercial ship repairing in the harbour. Cervia and the three other tugs were kept very busy with a variety of jobs both in the North Sea and with coastal towage contracts. In early 1977 two of the tugs of ITL, ST Hercules and ST Hero were taken out of service and returned to the Medway Maritime Trust, under the guidance of Martin Stevens. Nonetheless, ITL saw its business rapidly expand becoming an international operation all thanks to the reliability and hard work of Cervia and her sister tugs. To meet customer demands, Cervia and Goliath were joined further modern deep sea diesel powered tugs in 1978. by the 1980s, ITL’s fleet had grown to include the two most powerful tugs in the northern hemisphere and the business was sold off to the Far East. Cervia carried on working for ITL until 1983. Her last contract was to act as port tug for the new cross-channel ferry service at Ramsgate. The contract was terminated when the ferry service failed to operate a regular service due to the difficult economic climate of the early 1980s. Cervia was mothballed alongside the East Pier at Ramsgate Royal Harbour. Appearances in books and film It was after this time that Cervia fulfilled a different role as a film location in an episode of the BBC comedy series Ripping Yarns called The Curse Of The Claw with Michael Palin. Cervia had also been used in BBC production of Rogue Male starring Peter O'Toole in the mid-seventies. She was also the subject of a 1986 children's book, Cervia the Steam Tug, written and illustrated by Roger Ian Sacks in support of the East Kent Maritime Trust's Ramsgate Maritime Museum. Maritime Museum, Ramsgate After negotiations between Cervia’s owners and Thanet District Council's Harbour Master and his deputy, the tug was loaned and placed in the care of Ramsgate Maritime Museum, run by the East Kent Maritime Trust in July 1985. Later in July she was taken to moorings in John Smeaton's Historic Dry Dock. Funding was then secured for restoration work to be carried out on the Cervia. She was repainted to her original working livery of William Watkins days. A new mast was also fitted and her crew accommodation was refurbished to provide areas for museum displays. In 1986 Cervia was visited by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. To mark Cervia's 50th birthday a specialist engineer John Vineer oversaw restoration of the tugs 1,000 horsepower engine to full working order. Cervia became the centre point of the 'Historic Harbour' initiative and was joined by other vessels from the maritime museum's collection and privately owned classic boats. Uncertain future The East Kent Maritime Trust attempted to put together a joint restoration project for both the Smeaton's Dry Dock and the steam tug \\"Cervia\\". It was hoped that funding from a number of sources including the Heritage Lottery Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, other E.U. grants and private sources would be secured. The East Kent Maritime Trust has now shelved this project The Steam Museum Trust is now hoping to start a stand-alone restoration project for the tug. The ST Cervia now is moored in Ramsgate harbour, a rare survivor of steam ship development. She is the last seagoing steam tug to survive in UK waters, and she was also the last to work commercially.

For her performance as Skyler White, Anna Gunn received widespread critical acclaim, with some critics even lauding her character as the template for television anti-heroines. Gunn's portrayal won two consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2013 and 2014. In 2014, her performance in the episode \\"Ozymandias\\" was named as one of the best performances on television on various critics lists. She also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2014.  Character biography  Over the years, Skyler has had several meager sources of income: working as a bookkeeper for the Albuquerque firm Beneke Fabricators, writing short stories and selling items on eBay. She and her husband, Walter White (Bryan Cranston), have a son, Walt Jr. (RJ Mitte), who has cerebral palsy, and an infant daughter, Holly (Elanor Anne Wenrich). Her sister, Marie (Betsy Brandt), is married to a DEA agent, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris). Skyler is approximately 11 years younger than Walt, whom she met when she was a hostess at a diner near Walt's former place of work, near the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Season 1  Skyler is in the middle stages of pregnancy with Holly at the beginning of the show. When Walt is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he initially does not tell his family. When Skyler learns about the diagnosis, she is both devastated by the news and outraged that Walt withheld the information. Their relationship becomes strained, both from Walt's reluctance to seek treatment and from his unexplained absences following his diagnosis. Skyler figures out Walt's connection to his former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), and confronts Jesse at his house. When she confronts Walt, he claims that Jesse is his marijuana dealer. Unbeknownst to Skyler, Walt has taken up cooking methamphetamine with Jesse in order to ensure his family's financial security after he dies. Skyler faces other problems, as well. When Marie offers an expensive white gold tiara as a gift for Holly's baby shower, Skyler attempts to return it to the jewelry store, only to learn that her sister — a kleptomaniac — had stolen the item. Skyler is detained by the store's owner and escapes arrest only after faking labor pains. The incident causes serious problems in Skyler's relationship with Marie, who emphatically denies that she has done anything wrong.  Season 2  When Walt is kidnapped by Mexican drug kingpin Tuco Salamanca (Raymond Cruz), his family — unaware of the connection to Walt's criminal activities — organizes a search for him as a missing person. When Walt escapes, he fakes a \\"fugue state\\", claiming to have no memory of the last few days. The marriage continues going downhill thanks to Walt's continued absences, devolving to the point where Skyler refuses to speak to him. Skyler is also perturbed by Walt's resistance to his son's efforts to raise money for Walt's cancer treatments, unaware that most of the donations actually constitute drug money laundered by Walt's corrupt lawyer, Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk). Still unaware of Walt's meth business, Skyler believes his illness has strained the family's finances and returns to her old job working as an accountant for Ted Beneke (Christopher Cousins), whose sexual advances had caused her to quit earlier. She increasingly relies on Ted for emotional support as her husband grows distant; she also reluctantly covers up Ted's tax fraud. Shortly afterwards, Skyler gives birth to a daughter, Holly; Walt is absent for the occasion, having been forced to appear for a meth transaction with the drug kingpin Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). When Skyler becomes suspicious that Walt owns a second cell phone, Walt emphatically denies the charge. However, while Walt is medicated prior to cancer surgery, he indicates the opposite by replying, \\"Which one?\\", when Skyler asks if he has packed his cell phone. After Walt recovers, Skyler confronts him about that and leaves him when he lies about it.  Season 3  In the third season, Walt has moved out of the house. Skyler appears at his apartment, having deduced that he is in the drug trade. When she confronts Walt with her idea that he is selling cocaine, he admits instead that he is a meth cook (methamphetamine). Skyler demands a divorce in exchange for her silence about Walt's criminal activities. Skyler's rationale for remaining silent is two-fold: She does not want her children to find out their father's double life, and she fears that Walt's arrest could ruin Hank's career as a DEA agent. She also demands that Walt move out of the family's home. When Walt defiantly moves back in, Skyler retaliates by initiating an affair with Ted, and coldly informing her husband that she cheated on him. Even as her marriage crumbles, Skyler permits Walt to take care of Holly and defends some of his actions to her lawyer, who advises that she leave Walt immediately. She later finds that Walt has signed off on their divorce and left the house for good. When Ted arrives at her home and tries to clarify the nature of Skyler's feelings, she refuses to answer and asks him to leave. After Hank is shot during a failed hit by the Mexican cartel, Skyler tells Marie that Walt earned millions through card counting at underground blackjack games and offers to pay for Hank's physical therapy. She later admits to Walt that she never filed the divorce papers, slowly beginning to work her way into his criminal activities by reminding him that spouses cannot be forced to testify against each other. Skyler suggests Walt should launder his drug money by purchasing the car wash facility where he used to work, and offers to handle the books.  Season 4  Skyler buys the car wash and begins laundering Walt's drug money. She and Walt eventually have sex for the first time in months, and slowly begin to rebuild their relationship. At the same time, however, she begins to fear him, and worries that her children are in danger. At one point, she's so consumed with panic that she considers fleeing the state with Holly. When Ted is gravely injured during an encounter with Walt's associates, she feels responsible, having used Walt's drug money to pay off Ted's back taxes and then sent two of Saul Goodman's enforcers to ensure he didn't use it for anything else, leading to the injury. However, as a side- effect of Skyler's actions with Ted, Walt is left without the money to pay Saul's \\"disappearer\\" to take the family to a new life. Later, when Hank and Marie are under protective custody at their house, Skyler, Holly, and Walter Jr. join them. When she sees on the news that Fring has been killed, she makes a panicked phone call to Walt, who calmly informs her that he has \\"won\\"; she then realizes that Walt killed him.  Season 5  Part 1 = Following Fring's death, Skyler becomes terrified of Walt, as well as the prospect of going to prison as his accomplice. She breaks down in front of Marie at the car wash and falls into a deep state of depression. During a tense dinner with Hank and Marie, she stages a suicide attempt in an effort to convince the Schraders to temporarily take custody of the children. With them gone, Skyler makes it plain to Walt that she will do anything she can to keep them out of the house until his lung cancer comes back and kills him. Walt explains her emotional distress to the Schraders as the effect of serious marital discord, and he exposes Skyler's affair with Ted in the process. This taints Skyler's relationship with Marie, closing off a potential path of escape; Skyler is now effectively a prisoner in her own home. While she continues to launder money through the car wash, her attitude towards Walt devolves into a barely concealed hatred. Skyler eventually brings Walt to a storage locker packed with millions of dollars in cash, convincing him to get out of the drug business, as they now have more money than they will ever need. = Part 2 = When Hank deduces that Walt is a drug kingpin, he goes to Skyler under the assumption she was forced to keep quiet, but she refuses to give evidence. When Hank tells Marie, she meets with Skyler and is outraged to learn Skyler knew about Walt's activities before Hank was shot. Marie threatens to take Holly with her, but leaves the baby behind at Hank's insistence. When Hank is killed after arresting Walt, Skyler, believing Walt to be the killer, demands that he leave their house and threatens him with a knife. A physical altercation ensues which is ended by Walter Jr., who proceeds to call 911. Walt responds by kidnapping Holly, ignoring Skyler's desperate pleas for him to stop. That evening, Walt calls Skyler, as the police monitor the call, and effectively exonerates her of his misdeeds under the guise of an angry tirade. He leaves Holly at a fire station. As a national manhunt is launched against Walt, Skyler is questioned by federal prosecutors about his whereabouts. One of Walt's associates, Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons), and his gang break into the White home and threaten to kill Skyler and her children if she talks. A few months later, Walt learns that Skyler works as a taxi dispatcher and is using her maiden name; no court date has been set. Skyler and her children have moved out of the house, which is now abandoned. After Walt is sighted in Albuquerque, Marie calls her sister to warn her. But Walt is already at the home and has a long talk with Skyler, who is still angry at him but did not disclose he was there to Marie and makes no moves to contact law enforcement. Skyler figures out that Walt plans a suicide mission against the people who killed Hank and lets him imply this without stating it, and when she thinks Walt is going to give her his remaining drug money (which he actually forced the Schwartzes to launder for him) she tells him she and Flynn made it clear they don't want it. When Walt seems like he is going to use her and their kids as an excuse one more time for his actions, Skyler gets angry, but she is left stunned and silent when Walt admits that he entered the drug business for himself rather than his family, and then he gives her a lottery ticket with the coordinates of the makeshift grave in which Hank is buried to use as leverage for striking a deal with the prosecutors. Skyler then allows Walt to see Holly one last time before he leaves forever.  Reception  For her performance as Skyler, Anna Gunn received critical acclaim, with some critics even lauding her character as the template for television anti-heroines. For her portrayal, Gunn won two consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2013 and 2014. In 2014, her performance in the episode \\"Ozymandias\\" was named as one of the best performances on television on various critics lists. She also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2014.Blake, Meredith.\\"SAG Awards 2014: ‘Breaking Bad’ wins for ensemble in a TV drama series,\\" Los Angeles Times (JAN. 18, 2014). The character of Skyler White, however, received a lot of flak from viewers, and Gunn was often subject to social media criticism and bullying. The online harassment and threats became so bad that Gunn became concerned for her own physical safety, prompting her to write an Op-Ed published in the New York Times describing some of these incidents. Matt Zoller Seitz of Vulture considers her to be the Breaking Bad equivalent of Better Call Saul character Chuck McGill, a character that received similar hatred from viewers.

Schrader ASAC is a fictional character of the AMC drama series Breaking Bad and its spin-off series Better Call Saul. He is portrayed by Dean Norris and was created by series creator Vince Gilligan. Hank's character development over the course of the series and Norris' performance have been critically acclaimed.  Character biography  Henry R. Schrader is the brother-in-law of main character Walter White, and is a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Throughout the series, he leads the investigation of the methamphetamine cook \\"Heisenberg\\" — unaware that the elusive drug kingpin is his own brother-in-law. Hank is also faced with numerous threats from the rival drug cartels which takes a toll on Hank's mental health as the series progresses, and eventually starts taking more extreme measures to find \\"Heisenberg\\" and arrest him.  Background  Hank is a special agent with the DEA, where he rose through the ranks to become the supervisor of all investigations handled by his Albuquerque office, under the watchful eye of ASAC George Merkert (Michael Shamus Wiles) and SAC Ramey. He is married to Marie (Betsy Brandt), with whom he has no children. He is close to his family-by-marriage, the Whites: Walt, his wife (and Marie's sister) Skyler (Anna Gunn), and their son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). In contrast with the mild-mannered Walt, Hank is extroverted, ambitious and apparently fearless, eager to take on dangerous investigations to further his career. Beneath his tough, unflappable exterior, however, he struggles with some of his own vulnerabilities: he had cold feet when it came to marrying Marie, and despite his ambition he is afraid to move outside his comfort zone at work, primarily due to the effects of PTSD since killing Tuco Salamanca and subsequent bloody encounters during drug busts in El Paso. As a hobby, Hank home brews his own beer, which he calls \\"Schraderbräu\\". After he gets shot by the Salamanca cousins, he spends part of season 4 taking up mineral collecting, much to Marie's chagrin.  Better Call Saul  Season 5 = When Domingo Molina (later to be known as \\"Krazy-8\\") is arrested on drug possession, he spends two days in jail then announces he is willing to inform to the DEA to make a deal with prosecutors. Hank and his partner Steven Gomez arrive to interrogate him. Just as Domingo is prepared to give out a list of dead drops that belong to Gus Fring's drug operation, Saul Goodman interrupts the meeting acting as Domingo's lawyer. Hank immediately is suspicious of this and believes there are no dead drops, but Saul's fast-talking leads to Hank accepting to release Domingo into his protection as a personal CI after getting and confirming Domingo's information on the dead drops. Hank and Steven leave, unaware this was a ruse by Saul, at Lalo Salamanca's command, not only to get Domingo out of jail before he could talk about the Salamanca drug operation, but to expose their competitors to the DEA. Though Nacho Varga warns Gus Fring about this, he is unable to act without alerting Lalo to the mole in his organization.  Breaking Bad  Season 1 = During Walt's fiftieth birthday party, Hank shows off a news report covering a meth bust that he had led. Later, Walt takes up Hank's offer to go on a ride-along. Based on a tip from Krazy-8, Hank's team raids a meth lab while Walt stays in the car, where he witnesses his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) escaping the bust, but does not say anything to Hank. Secretly, Walt engages with Jesse to start to produce their own meth using chemistry equipment from the school Walt teaches at. Due to the precursors they used, the product gains a unique blue tint but has an extremely high purity. Walt takes the name \\"Heisenberg\\" as he and Jesse sell the blue meth to the local drug trade. The blue meth and \\"Heisenberg\\" quickly draw the attention of Hank and the DEA. Hank's initial lead traces back to Walt's school, but Hank wrongly arrests the school janitor. Hank generally teases Walt through this period. However, when Walt tells the family that he is suffering from inoperable lung cancer, Hank promises to be there for him, and to take care of Walter Jr. and Walt's unborn daughter should he die. He also takes Walter Jr. under his wing, trying to \\"scare him straight\\" when he believes the boy is smoking marijuana. When Hank sees Walt interacting with Jesse, Walt explains that Jesse is supplying him with marijuana. = Season 2 = After a drug deal goes bad, Walt and Jesse are kidnapped by the unstable Tuco Salamanca (Raymond Cruz) and taken to a remote abode with his uncle, retired drug cartel boss Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis). Hank helps with efforts to find Walt, and traces him via Jesse to Tuco's abode. Just before Hank arrives, Walt and Jesse manage to escape, wounding Tuco in the process. Hank kills Tuco in a shootout and arrests Hector. Meanwhile, Walt and Jesse flee back to Albuquerque, where Walt explains his disappearance to Skyler as being in a fugue state. Hank questions Hector on the blue meth and Heisenberg, but Hector refuses to answer. Hank also questions Jesse, but Jesse provides no conclusive statements to provide leads to Heisenberg. Hank is promoted and transferred to the El Paso, Texas DEA office for killing Tuco. Though initially happy, Hank starts having panic attacks. During a joint DEA/Mexican police operation, an informant is beheaded and their head used to hide an explosive, killing several DEA agents and officers; Hank escapes unharmed as he had fled on having a panic attack upon seeing the head of the informant. Hank develops symptoms of PTSD and transfers back to the Albuquerque office to continue his investigation into the blue meth. Meanwhile, Walt and Jesse, having lost the Salamancas for selling meth, have engaged with Jesse's friends. One, Badger (Matt L. Jones), gets caught in a police sting, and Hank presses hard on Badger to reveal Heisenberg's identity. Walt gets help from the fast-talking lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) to get a fall guy to act as Heisenberg, but Badger fingers the wrong person while Hank and his team look on. Walt and Jesse rush in to obstruct Hank's view to correct Badger in time. While Saul's hired Heisenberg is arrested, Hank suspects the real Heisenberg remains at large. = Season 3 = Hank remains committed to finding the identity of Heisenberg, but his superiors start to believe the case is unsolvable and want him to move onto other investigations. He picks up a lead on the case after Jesse used some of the blue meth to pay for gas for the recreational vehicle he and Walt use to cook the product. Ultimately, he identifies Jesse as the RV's owner, and races to the junkyard where Jesse has been staying in the RV. Hank calls Walt on the news, giving Walt the opportunity to beat Hank there. Hiding in the RV with Jesse, Walt gives instructions to Jesse to prevent Hank from entering the RV legally, and gets Saul to lure Hank away from the junkyard by phoning him with a fake claim about his wife Marie being hospitalized. He abruptly leaves, allowing them to crush the RV in the meantime, destroying the evidence. After seeing the RV gone when he returns, an infuriated Hank goes to Jesse's home and assaults him. Jesse is hospitalized and threatens to sue, while Hank is suspended from the DEA without pay. As Hank is leaving his disciplinary meeting, he receives an anonymous call from Gus Fring, warning him that he is about to be killed by Leonel and Marco Salamanca (Daniel and Luis Moncada) in revenge for killing Tuco; though Gus has told the brothers to target Hank instead of Walt, Gus realized that Walt would be unable to cook meth for him if Hank died. Hank is able to kill one brother and mortally wound the other, but he himself becomes temporarily paralyzed from the waist down after the gunfight, with the doctors fearing he may become paraplegic without physical therapy. Marie finds their insurance will not cover this, and Walt and Skyler agree to help cover the costs, unbeknown to Hank. = Season 4 = Hank struggles through his recovery due to his helplessness, harshly lashing out at Marie, and tries to collect minerals to pass the time. His interest is piqued when the Albuquerque Police Department ask him to help with looking over evidence from the murder of Gale Boetticher (David Costabile), who had been Walt's lab assistant at Gus' meth superlab under an industrial laundry. Among the evidence is a lab notebook with Gale's notes on the construction of the lab, the synthesis of meth, and other details that leads Hank to believe Gale was Heisenberg. During a shared dinner, Hank talks about Gale's notebook, and Walt drunkenly suggests Gale was merely copying the real Heisenberg's work. Hank is curious at this comment, and reviewing the evidence again, makes a connection between Gale and Gus. Hank, only just starting to physically recover, leans on Walt to help him investigate Gus' activities, the Los Pollos Hermanos' restaurant chain and its parent company, Madrigal Electromotive, and properties they own in Albuquerque, including the industrial laundry. Walt panics knowing that this not only may lead Hank to discover that he is Heisenberg, but may lead to Gus taking deadly action to end Hank's investigation, since Walt and Jesse were already on thin ice for killing Gale. Walt has Saul fake a threat on Hank's life, and the DEA arrange for around- the-clock protection for Hank's and Walt's families, temporarily halting Hank's investigation. This also allows Walt to operate without interference to take out Gus by working with Hector after learning he and Gus are nemesis. Hector claims to want to talk to the DEA, and Hank is brought under protection to help with the interview, but Hector then refuses to cooperate and is returned to the nursing home. This was part of Walt's plan as Gus, learning of Hector's interview, goes to see Hector, upon which Hector triggers a pipe bomb Walt had planted on his wheelchair, killing them both. Walt and Jesse subsequently destroy the superlab. = Season 5  Part 1  The destruction of the superlab leads to evidence directly tying to Gus and the drug trade, and Hank is heralded as a hero. They secure a laptop from Gus' office and put it into police evidence. On learning of this, Walt and Jesse with help from Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) use a giant electromagnet to try to wipe the laptop, making a mess of the evidence room. The police find nothing on the laptop but from a picture frame broken in the destruction, the numbers to several accounts of Gus' that point to Mike's informants that have been helping to keep the drug trade secret. By this point, Hank's superiors have concluded that Gus was Heisenberg and tell Hank to drop the case, but Hank still believes there is more, and want to pursue the informants tied to the accounts. Walt is forced to kill Mike to get the informants' names and arrange for their murders before they can be questioned. Several months pass, in which Walt has accumulated over $70 million and has left the drug trade. With no blue meth on streets and no leads, Hank has given up his investigation and moved on. At a dinner at the Whites, Hank goes to the bathroom and while there, pages through a copy of Leaves of Grass that Gale had given Walter. He recognizes the writing from Gale's notebook, and from Gale's dedication to Walt, is shocked to conclude that Walt is Heisenberg.  Part 2  Hank feigns a stomach bug to leave early, taking the copy of Leaves of Grass with him, and suffers another panic attack. Later, he sneaks a GPS onto Walt's car. Walt discovers the copy of the book missing and the GPS device, similar to the one used to track Gus, and confronts Hank. Hank asserts Walt is Heisenberg, but Walt neither confirms or denies, only that his cancer has returned and by the time Hank can prove anything, he will be dead. Hank demands Walt to tell Skyler and the children to stay with him, but Walt refuses. Hank tries to talk to Skyler, but she stays silent on what she knows. Marie learns some details through Skyler, but Hank still has insufficient evidence to go forward against Walt. Jesse is arrested and Hank tries to convince Jesse to speak out against Walt, but Jesse refuses, still angered over Hank's prior assault. Walt crafts a DVD that appears to be a self-confession from Hank that he is Heisenberg, threatening to release it if Hank does not stop trying to interfere with his family. Hank also realizes that his post-shooting physical therapy was paid with Walt's drug money, making him an accessory after the fact. Hank once again approaches Jesse and finally convinces they need to work together to stop Walt. Hank initially tries to have Jesse meet with Walt while wearing a wire tap, but Jesse backs out at the last minute, fearing Walt will kill him. Instead, Jesse suggests they target Walt's money, which they know has been hidden as cash somewhere locally. After trying to locate it on their own, Hank has Jesse call Walt pretending to have found the money and preparing to destroy it. Walt takes off to the money, buried on the Tohajiilee Indian Reservation, and when he finds it intact, realizes Jesse has fooled him, and orders a hit on Jesse through Jack Welker (Michael Bowen). Jesse soon arrives with Hank and Gomez, and Walt tries to call off the hit, preparing to surrender himself to Hank. However, Jack's men arrive before then, and a firefight breaks out, which kills Gomez and critically wounds Hank. Walt pleads to Jack to spare Hank's life, offering his entire fortune to Jack. Hank refuses to beg for his life and asks Walt how such an intelligent man could be too naive to see that Jack had already made his decision. Hank then tells Jack to do what he has to do and Jack kills him with a shot to the head. Jack's men bury Hank and Gomez' bodies in the hole Walt had stored his money. Six months later, after Walt had fled the state with a new identity, he returns to make his amends, and gives Skyler the location of the bodies, knowing it will help her to plea bargain her case. Hank and Gomez are avenged that same night when Walt kills Jack, Todd, Lydia and their crew, resulting in his own death.  Casting and creation  Prior to being cast in Breaking Bad, Dean Norris had a history of being typecast as law enforcement and military type characters. Norris reasons \\"I guess you have a certain look, it's kind of an authoritative law enforcement-type look, and that look is certainly the first thing that people cast you with before you get a chance to do some acting.\\" Vince Gilligan had talked to an actual DEA agent about creating Hank's character.  Development  Critics have commented on the character's development. NPR writes of his character's evolution \\"Hank Schrader has evolved from a knuckleheaded jock into a complex, sympathetic and even heroic counterpoint to the show's anti-hero, [...] Walter White.\\" Mary Kaye Schilling of Vulture opines \\"It's thanks to [Norris] that Breaking Bad's Hank Schrader has gone from a cliché-spewing booya DEA agent — essentially comic relief — to a savvy, vulnerable mensch who could be the show's ultimate hero.\\" Norris notes the realism of Hank's \\"tough cop\\" and \\"cliché machine\\" persona, comparing his mannerisms to his best friend growing up, also a cop. Norris explains that people with jobs in law enforcement have to put on a bravado facade because they have to deal with unscrupulous people all day; the only other option would be to let the job affect them personally, which would compromise their effectiveness. Gilligan says Hank was supposed to be a \\"hail fellow well met and a figure of worship for Walt, Jr.,\\" but developed him when he realized how \\"smart, sensitive, and well educated\\" Norris was. Norris and Gilligan both wanted Hank to be smart and capable; \\"Otherwise,\\" Norris said, \\"he’s just a doofus and you'll dismiss him.\\" Norris notes that Hank bullies Walt in the pilot and the first season, and makes racist jokes about his DEA partner Steven Gomez. However, his racist jokes toward Gomez were toned down as the series progressed and were turned into good-natured ribbing. Sean Collins of Rolling Stone considered Hank in the pilot to be an \\"obnoxious blowhard\\". Gilligan had not considered the character as much more than a foil to Walt at first. However, as Gilligan got to know Norris, he developed Hank into a \\"more nuanced and complex character\\" who makes both \\"personal and professional growth\\". Frazier Moore of The Associated Press writes of Hank's introduction in the pilot; \\"Hank seemed a potentially problematic character. With his cocky, macho style, he was perilously close to a stereotype\\"; however, he has said \\"Norris has brought depth and nuance to his character, emerging as fully the equal of his fine fellow cast mates [...] as he displayed not just braggadocio but also emotional trauma.\\" Norris and Gilligan admitted that Hank began as a \\"mechanical construct\\" whose main purpose was to provide comic relief. Hank begins showing signs of post-traumatic stress disorder in \\"Breakage\\" after killing Tuco Salamanca in \\"Grilled\\", the first deconstruction of his \\"tough cop\\" persona. Norris attributed the PTSD to the fact that it is actually very rare for law enforcement officers to draw their weapons, let alone kill someone in a combat situation. Mary Kaye Schilling praised the way the writers handled the PTSD and how they waited an entire season to explain the cause of it. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club compared season 1-era Hank to a \\"veiled (and unacknowledged) Vic Mackey parody,\\" but praised his development which began with his suffering PTSD. Seth Amitin of IGN noted that Hank's PTSD humanized the character, as Amitin thought of him as an \\"emotional rock\\" who is usually unfazed. However, Amitin thought that Hank's humanization and inner struggle fit in with the other character's arcs and the series' themes. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker writes of Hank's fight with Walt, the series \\"placed Hank, once a minor, comic character on the show, dead center in the role of hero.\\" Graeme Virtue of The Guardian writes Norris \\"evolved his character Hank Schrader from cocksure DEA meathead to the closest thing the show has to a moral center.\\" Hank went through significant character development in the third season episode, \\"One Minute\\". Norris felt that Hank's self-realization in the episode was the turning point toward his becoming a better man, and set the stage for his decisions later in the series; Norris opined that \\"Hank wants a clean soul.\\" Norris kept tearing up while filming a particularly dramatic speech, though the director kept telling him not to. Norris was eventually filmed from the side to obscure the fact that he was crying. In the early fourth season episodes, Hank is bedridden after being shot multiple times in the chest by Tuco Salamanca's cousins, and is increasingly hostile toward Marie while she tries to take care of him. Gilligan and the writers liked the idea of Hank not acting heroically or noble in his suffering. The writers felt this arc would be most true to Hank's character. When asked about how Hank could have not known his brother-in-law was Heisenberg, Norris said that Walt was Hank's blind spot; Hank had this preconceived notion of a drug kingpin in his head and it did not coincide with his image of Walt as meek and oblivious. After Hank finally discovers that Walt is Heisenberg, Norris had to balance betrayal with rage, citing the hurt of Walt's betrayal of his trust as his most significant emotion. Norris said that, in the episode \\"Blood Money,\\" Hank's emotions finally take over. Norris has said that he thinks Hank's moral code is concretely defined in \\"One Minute,\\" when he accepts the consequences for assaulting Jesse even though he could have gotten away with it.Tannenbaum, Rob (September 12, 2013). \\"Dean Norris Explains Hank's Moral Code on 'Breaking Bad.'\\" Retrieved 19 September 2013. In an interview during the first half of season 5, Norris expressed his puzzlement at viewers who \\"don't know who to root for\\", and that he sees Walt as a straightforward villain.Dean Norris on Playing Hank in \\"Breaking Bad.\\" Conan.

Norris asked Gilligan to kill Hank off midway through the fifth season, as Norris had already booked a comedy pilot before he knew AMC would stretch the fifth into two years. Gilligan declined his request, as Hank's arc was integral to the series' final episodes. When the spin-off Better Call Saul was first announced, Norris initially stated that he wasn't interested in appearing, saying that he felt the Breaking Bad story was complete and that a spin-off would be unnecessary.https://screencrush.com/breaking-bad-better-call-saul-dean-norris- hank-aaron-paul-jesse/https://www.bustle.com/articles/43862-breaking-bads- dean-norris-doesnt-approve-of-better-call-saul-but-the-show-will-go-on Peter Gould was initially hesitant to include Hank in Better Call Saul since the character had primarily been developed and written by Gilligan, who despite serving as co-executive producer had not been in the writers room for the show since Season 3.Insider Podcast Despite his earlier lukewarm reception to the spin-off Dean Norris himself however welcomed playing the version of Hank before he became afflicted with PTSD and depression.https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/03/02/dean- norris-breaking-bad-dea-agent-better-call-saul/4895744002/ He particularly enjoyed the on-screen reunion with Steve Gomez actor Steven Michael Quezada.  Reception  Hank's development as a character and Norris' performance have both received critical acclaim. Frank Girardot of Pasadena Star-News, an old friend of Norris', says that he watched Norris grow into the role, and praised him as \\"a damn good actor. Certainly the best on TV right now.\\" Dean Norris' acting in \\"Blood Money\\", especially the climactic scene where Hank confronts Walt over the latter's identity as Heisenberg, was lauded by critics. James Poniewozik of TIME wrote \\"Norris and Cranston are both eye magnets here, and the force just arcs between them as your attention is drawn irresistibly to both at once.\\" Cinema Blend 's Kelly West said Walt and Hank's conversation might have been the \\"most heated and emotional moments of the series,\\" praising Cranston and Norris. David Berry of National Post and Scott Meslow of The Week also praised Norris. Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic wrote of the climax \\"Dean Norris' expressions conveyed how dismayed, distraught, vengeful and stunned he was at the same time.\\" TVLine named Dean Norris the \\"Performer of the Week\\" for his work in \\"Blood Money.\\" In doing so, TVLine highlighted Hank's development over the course of the series, citing the character's evolution from \\"an unapologetic blowhard\\" in the pilot to \\"someone you truly want to see win.\\" Ross Douthat of The New York Times called Hank the hero of Breaking Bad and wrote that \\"one of the show’s most impressive and important achievements has been the construction of a compelling, interesting, entertaining good person, capable of competing with Walter White, the anti- hero, for the audience’s attention and interest and affection.\\" In 2011, Norris was nominated at the 37th Saturn Awards for Best Supporting Actor on Television for the third season, but lost to John Noble for his performance as Dr. Walter Bishop in Fringe.

Played by Betsy Brandt, she is Skyler White's sister, Hank's wife, and Walter White's sister-in-law. In the series, Marie works as a radiologic technologist. She does not hesitate to offer advice to others but often fails to practice what she preaches. She shoplifts compulsively—apparently a manifest symptom of kleptomania—a behavior for which she sees a therapist. She appears self-centered and shallow but cares deeply for her husband and her sister's family. Nearly all of her household and clothing items are shades of the color purple.  Character biography = Season 1  Born Marie Lambert, she is a radiologic technologist, and lives with her husband Hank, a DEA agent, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Walter White (husband of Marie's older sister Skyler) learns that he has lung cancer, but initially keeps this from his family, along with Marie and Hank. Once Walt reveals this to Marie, Hank and his son Walter Jr., Marie tells Skyler (who already knows) about lining up an \\"oncology dream team\\". After Walt initially refuses treatment, Marie sides with him. At Skyler's baby shower, Marie presents her with an expensive white gold baby's tiara, much to Hank's irritation. When Skyler goes to return the tiara, she is detained in the store – it turns out that Marie stole it, but Skyler matches her description. She pretends to go into labor, persuading them to let her go. Skyler later confronts Marie about the theft, but Marie calmly denies it.  Season 2  Skyler refuses to answer phone calls from Marie. Marie and Hank argue about whether or not she attempted to schedule a dinner with Skyler in a way that conflicts with another appointment that she has for therapy, revealing that Marie reluctantly goes to therapy for unspecified problems. Hank visits Skyler and asks her to make up with Marie. Skyler responds angrily, stating that her situation is worse than her sister's. Hank and Skyler both realize that the other knows about Marie's kleptomania. At a cookout celebrating Hank's promotion, Skyler demands that Marie apologize for giving Skyler the stolen tiara, or it will irreversibly drive a wedge between them; Marie tearfully does so. After Hank is left with posttraumatic stress disorder, having barely escaped a bombing, Marie becomes a major source of comfort and support to him.  Season 3  After an unarmed Hank is nearly killed by The Cousins, and left in critical condition with four gunshot wounds, Marie berates Hank's boss and partner when she hears they had taken his gun away (due to a battery charge), leaving him defenseless. Marie is at a loss about what to do when she learns that their health plan will not provide the quantity and the quality of physical therapy Hank requires to fully recover the use of his legs. Skyler proposes that she and Walt pay the bills, claiming that they can afford it because Walt has become a successful gambler (hiding the fact that Walt is a drug kingpin), to which Marie agrees. At the hospital, Marie is thrilled at the prospect of Hank's returning home, but he does not seem as pleased. She later wheels him out of the hospital after winning a bet where she arouses him during a sponge bath.  Season 4  Hank struggles with life at home after his injury, snapping at Marie and becoming more preoccupied with collecting and cataloging minerals; Marie struggles to maintain her composure while caring for her belligerent husband. Days later, Marie continues struggling to deal with Hank's deepening depression as he copes with physical therapy from having been shot. The bed-ridden and bitter Hank constantly ignores or insults Marie and, even after celebrating a successful session with his physical therapist, he refuses to share any of that excitement with Marie. Frustrated by Hank's continuous cold shoulder, Marie resumes her kleptomania; she starts stealing objects from real-estate open houses, where she also makes up elaborate stories about who she is, but is eventually caught by a real-estate agent. A livid Hank pulls strings with a senior police officer to get her out of being charged.  Season 5  Part 1 = While discussing Walt's upcoming 51st birthday with Marie, Skyler begins to light a cigarette. As Marie begins to confront her about smoking, Skyler screams \\"shut up\\" repeatedly and suffers a nervous breakdown. Marie confronts Walt at home about Skyler's breakdown and demands to know the truth. Walt tells her about Skyler's affair with Ted Beneke and that her breakdown was due to stress over his recent accident. As Walt and Skyler have marital problems, Marie volunteers to take in their children – Walter Jr. and Holly – for a couple of days while they work things out. While visiting Holly, a tearful Skyler is tempted to confess to Marie about Walt's criminal activities, but stops short when Marie discloses her knowledge of Skyler's affair with Ted. Marie mistakenly believes this to be the reason for Skyler's mental anguish. = Part 2 = Hank, having discovered Walt's criminal activities, shares this with Marie, and she confronts Skyler. Learning Skyler knew of Walt before Hank was shot, Marie slaps her sister and storms out of the room. She tries to take Holly with her, but Hank commands her to return the baby. She then tells Hank, \\"You have to get him.\\" Marie helps Hank try to stop Walt and Skyler, but their attempts are thwarted when Walt makes a DVD framing Hank. Marie is eager to help Hank when Jesse Pinkman agrees to confess about Walt's crimes. After Hank is killed by Jack Welker, she is initially unaware of his death and reconciles with Skyler on the condition she tells Walter Jr. everything. Marie learns that Hank is missing when Walt kidnaps Holly, and eventually receives confirmation he is dead. Jack's gang raids Marie's house and finds Jesse's confession tape, leading to Marie being sent to a safe house. Two months later, Marie warns Skyler to be on the lookout for Walt, but unknown to her, Walt is standing in the same room while Skyler is on the phone.  Concept and creation  In February 2007, Betsy Brandt was cast in Breaking Bad in the main cast. She described Marie as a \\"bitch\\" when the character is first introduced, but noted that eventually the audience would find out there is more to her. She also has personal experiences having an older sister of a much older age that she related to Marie and Skyler's relationship. Depicting Marie as a radiologic technologist was Brandt's idea; she did not want Marie to be a doctor or a nurse, but a medical professional. Throughout the series, Marie is almost always shown wearing the color purple, which creator Vince Gilligan explained is symbolic of her being mislead, for example, Walt and Skyler were deluding Marie about who was behind the drug business. Brandt refused to watch the scene of Hank being killed by Jack. When asked if the scene where Marie learns Walt's criminal activities almost lead to Hank's death in the third season pushed her \\"over the edge\\", Brandt replied, \\"That they in any way would be willing to jeopardize Hank's life and then lie to her about it – that's a lot to swallow. The big watershed moment was Marie finding out that Walt and Skyler were willing to do that. It would be hard enough [finding out] that only Walt knew. But the fact that Skyler knew and just watched Marie worry about Hank's safety and not tell her? That's just painful.\\" Gilligan revealed that he wanted to have Marie make a cameo appearance in the Better Call Saul season 2 finale, \\"Klick\\", but the Writer's Room objected, considering the idea to be distracting for audiences.  Analysis  Writer Brad Klypchak linked Marie's kleptomaniac behavior to the emotional emptiness of material abundance. In the series finale, Marie is shown wearing black-and-white instead of her usual purple; according to Screen Rant's Matthew Wilkinson, this symbolizes her grief.  Legacy  \\"Marie's Purple Cake\\" was a real dessert item offered at the \\"Breaking Bad Experience\\" pop-up that opened in Los Angeles in 2019 during the premiere of El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.

He is portrayed by Bob Odenkirk, and was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. The character is an Albuquerque- based lawyer who embraces his tendencies as a former scam artist and begins to represent criminals while himself becoming involved in the city's criminal world. Saul's name is a play on the phrase \\"[It]'s all good, man\\".  Development  Bob Odenkirk portrays Saul Goodman/Jimmy McGill/Gene Takavic in both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul The need for a character like Saul came from two paths of Breaking Bads development around the show's second season. First, as Walt and Jesse got themselves deeper into the drug business, the show's writers felt they needed a character to be a guide for them. At this point, they had written that Jesse's dimwitted friends like Badger were selling their drugs, they needed to envision what type of lawyer they would enlist should they run into trouble. Secondly, they were at a point in Hank's character arc where he had suffered a major trauma in seeing Tortuga's severed head, and he would no longer be able to serve as the show's bit of lightness. They thus made Saul more of a comical character to fill this void. The creators decided on the name \\"Saul Goodman\\" as a play on the phrase \\"[It]'s all good, man\\", as in that even his most simple-minded clients would remember his name when they get arrested. Gould credits Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan for initially suggesting this idea for Saul's name. The Breaking Bad episode \\"Better Call Saul\\" was written by Peter Gould, and he has been ultimately credited with creating the character. In terms of casting for the part, both Gilligan and Gould said that their crew included a number of fans of Mr. Show with Bob and David, including Gould's wife Nora, and Odenkirk's name quickly came up for the role. Odenkirk based the character's speaking style on producer Robert Evans. Saul was originally intended to appear in only three episodes of the second season of Breaking Bad, but instead became central to the narrative of the series. Though originally written as a \\"two- and-a-half-dimensional\\" comic relief character, Saul's role became more in- depth, as Gilligan and Gould found they could use Saul as a \\"further entree to the criminal underbelly\\" for Walt in the later seasons. This also allowed them to give the character more humanity, which the showrunners credited to Odenkirk's acting skills. They considered that like with Aaron Paul and Dean Norris, Odenkirk's acting capability significantly altered plans they had for these characters and the show in a beneficial manner, making them more central to the larger plot. As Saul had proven to be a popular character with audiences, Gilligan and Gould already had started thinking about a spin-off involving Saul and approached Odenkirk on his interest to make it happen. Once Breaking Bad was completed, Gilligan and Gould worked to establish what the spinoff series would be about, ultimately coming onto the idea of a prequel named Better Call Saul that would feature Jimmy McGill and how he would become Saul Goodman. The showrunners realized that Saul was, as seen in Breaking Bad, \\"comfortable in his own skin\\" and had nowhere else to go, that they could instead explore how Saul got to that point, mirroring the same type of self- destruction that occurred to Walter White in Breaking Bad. They saw Jimmy as an \\"earnest, sweet guy whose brain naturally cooks up dishonest solutions to the challenges in front of him\\", where by the time of Breaking Bad, Saul is a \\"front\\" for one who \\"seemed to enjoy being a showy cheeseball\\", and a \\"hermetically sealed slickster\\". Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim Wexler, Jimmy's romantic interest in Better Call Saul, said that one aspect of Jimmy she incorporated into her acting was the spontaneity of Jimmy slipping into and out of the Saul Goodman character, or as Gould had described to her, \\"right there at the moment\\", a factor that for Kim and other associates of Jimmy can cause confusion and concern. Breaking Bad established little of Saul's origins, and even had stated that Saul was not his real name. This gave Gilligan, Gould, and Odenkirk a chance to flesh out more of Jimmy's backstory for Better Call Saul. Odenkirk and Gilligan set Jimmy's hometown as Chicago, in part as it was Odenkirk's own hometown as well as a homage to the notorious corruption in the political history of Chicago as inspiration for the character. In 2014, as a publicity stunt for the launch of Better Call Saul, a billboard for \\"James M. McGill, Attorney at Law\\" was placed in Albuquerque, mimicking a billboard that appeared on the show, with a phone number connecting to a voicemail message recorded by Odenkirk.  Biography  Jimmy is of Irish descent and was born on November 12, 1960 in Cicero, Illinois, outside Chicago. His older brother Chuck became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s general store in Cicero, and watched as customers took advantage of his naïve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. According to Chuck, Jimmy embezzled $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father's bankruptcy. His father died six months later; Jimmy cried inconsolably at the funeral. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy becomes a con artist, and earns the nickname \\"Slippin' Jimmy\\" for staging \\"slip and fall\\" accidents. He also ran petty scams including the \\"fake Rolex\\" with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak. Jimmy ran into trouble with the law when he drunkenly defecated through the sunroof of an adversary's car while the man's children were inside. Facing the possibility of having to register as a sex offender, Jimmy asked Chuck for help, despite a five-year separation with his family. Chuck successfully defended him, but required that he move to Albuquerque and work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. At some point prior to the start of the show, Jimmy had been married and divorced twice. While working in the HHM mail room, Jimmy befriended Kim Wexler, an HHM employee attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completed his college degree and attended The University of Samoa correspondence law school. He passed the bar exam and hoped to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's insistence, senior partner Howard Hamlin denied Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then began a solo practice, working out of the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon. He takes whatever cases he can get, primarily low paid public defender work. Some years later, near the time of his divorce with Rebecca, Chuck develops a psychosomatic aversion to electricity, becoming semi-reclusive. Faithfully Jimmy cares for Chuck, bringing him groceries and running his errands. Jimmy still struggles with finances, and at the start of the show drives a signature Suzuki Esteem with mismatched doors, a visual pun reflecting on Jimmy's current poor self-esteem at this stage of his life. Jimmy butts heads with Mike Ehrmantraut, a former Philly police officer working as a courthouse parking lot attendant, Jimmy begins to use the alias \\"Saul Goodman\\", a play on the phrase \\"It's all good, man\\". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in television ads he produces, and later makes use of it when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street.  Better Call Saul  Season 1 = Unhappy with working as a public defender for low pay, Jimmy hopes to represent hapless, county treasurer Craig Kettleman and his wife Betsy, a couple accused of embezzling over $1.6 million. They retain the services of HHM, but Jimmy's attempts to represent them, leads to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca and Nacho Varga, members of the Juarez drug cartel. When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping. Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release. Following Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding in the foothills behind their home. When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him $50,000 not to turn over the money. HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, so they turn to Jimmy for defense. Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place. Mike commandeers the stolen funds and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing Craig to accept a guilty plea. Jimmy produces wills for several elderly clients, exhibiting patience and a great rapport, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients. With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a class action lawsuit against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation. Jimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past. Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away. = Season 2 = Jimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card. Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer. Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys. Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M; partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him. Kim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial. In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank. Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit. Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together. Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M;, Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms. Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM. Chuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto calls Jimmy for help. While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house. As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay. Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him. Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it. Knowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk. Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk. Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives. Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head. Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents. Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital. He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch. Ernesto lies to Chuck, saying he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store out of concern for Chuck's health. Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are psychosomatic. Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records. = Season 3 = Odenkirk (left) and Lavell Crawford as Saul and Huell during filming of the third season of Breaking Bad Chuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it. Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police. Jimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case. Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his hypersensitivity. Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms. The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience. Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred. To both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman. He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting. Jimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her. When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on the public address system he uses to call Bingo games at the senior center. Irene is vindicated and her friendships are restored, but Jimmy's confession costs him his share of the proposed settlement. Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm. Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment. Jimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended. Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, an act calculated to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance premiums. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that HHM's insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney. Chuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire. Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him. Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running. Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze. = Season 4 = Jimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates. Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor. While job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable Hummel figurine from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do. While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias. Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting pro bono criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying. Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out. Near the end of his year of his probation, Jimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation. Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building. Jimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death. To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the University of New Mexico. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a DBA application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman. = Season 5 = Jimmy starts a law practice as Saul Goodman to capitalize on the alias from his prepaid cell phone business. He offers Kim astute, pragmatic advice with her pro bono clientele, advice that is both appreciated and yet frustrating in its moral ambiguity and specious nature. Mesa Verde Bank intends to evict Everett Acker from his leased land to make way for a new call center, and offers Acker a meager settlement. Kim sympathizes with Acker and has Jimmy become his counsel. Jimmy employs delaying tactics in hopes of swaying the bank to accept an alternative to Acker's eviction, but Kevin, the bank's president, is adamant. With Rich threatening to pull Kim off the Mesa Verde case, Kim asks Jimmy to persuade Acker to accept an improved settlement in which she will make up the difference between what Acker wants and what the bank will pay. Jimmy agrees, but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he surprises everyone with an outlandish offer and threats of negative publicity against the bank, which leads Kevin to agree to a more favorable deal. Kim is furious at Jimmy for not making her aware of his plan and suggests they marry so their conversations will be protected by spousal privilege. They marry the next day in a small courthouse ceremony. Howard feels guilt over his past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a job at HHM. Jimmy is unsettled by the reminder of his past and harasses Howard by damaging his car and disrupting his business lunch with Clifford Main. Howard realizes Jimmy is toying with him and rescinds the job offer; Jimmy angrily replies that as Saul Goodman, he is too big for the constraints of HHM. Nacho and Lalo Salamanca involve Jimmy in the Salamanca drug business when they hire him to gain Domingo Molina's release from jail by having him pose as a confidential informant for DEA Agent Hank Schrader. Jimmy later represents Lalo when he is arrested for murder. Gus Fring, the rival in the drug business to the Salamancas, wants Lalo released, so Mike provides information that enables Jimmy to persuade a judge to grant bail of $7 million cash. Jimmy agrees to accept $100,000 in exchange for transporting the money from a remote desert site. He picks up the cash from Leonel and Marco Salamanca (the Cousins), but on his return trip is attacked by several gunmen. Mike was tracking Jimmy for Gus and kills all but one attacker. Jimmy's car breaks down, forcing them to hide the car from the remaining attacker and trek cross-country with the money. They walk for two days and work together to kill the remaining gunman before they are able to call for help. The events leave Jimmy suffering from post-traumatic stress. After posting Lalo's bail, Jimmy tells Lalo he walked cross-country alone after his car broke down so he would not risk losing the money. Jimmy tells Kim the same story, but she sees he is lying and tells him she will be ready to listen when he is ready to tell her the truth. Jimmy cuts his recuperation short to deal with clients at the courthouse. When he returns that night, Kim tells him she quit Schweikart & Cokely and gave up the Mesa Verde account. As they argue, Mike phones to warn Jimmy that instead of going to Mexico, Lalo is en route to Jimmy and Kim's apartment. As Mike listens in via Jimmy's concealed cell phone and trains a sniper rifle on Lalo, Lalo questions Jimmy's version of events and reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim stands up to Lalo and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied and leaves, but Jimmy and Kim move to a hotel for their safety. The next day, Jimmy learns from Mike that Lalo returned to Mexico and is to be assassinated that evening. That evening Kim tells Jimmy she saw Howard at the courthouse. On learning she left S&C;, Howard told her about Jimmy's harassment campaign and suggested that Jimmy was a bad influence on her, which she aggressively denied. She suggests they force an early settlement in the Sandpiper case, which would give Jimmy his seven-figure share of the settlement sooner. Jimmy counsels against it, but Kim confidently affirms her intent by returning the same finger gun gesture Jimmy used when announcing he intended to practice law as Saul Goodman.  Breaking Bad  By the time of Saul's introduction in Breaking Bad, he has fully adopted the identity of \\"Saul Goodman\\", and rarely mentions the name McGill. Saul is an astutely aggressive defense attorney, aided by his working knowledge of Spanish, but also engages in questionable as well as blatantly criminal activity, such as abetting money laundering. He routinely dresses in loud, gaudy colors, and now drives a Cadillac DeVille. Saul has established an office in a strip mall, adorned with Roman columns, and the US Constitution wallpapered behind them, his tasteless, ostentatious advertising panders to the criminal mind and includes a large inflatable Statue of Liberty balloon. He has ties to Gus Fring, the owner of the \\"Los Pollos Hermanos\\" fast-food chicken franchise around Albuquerque which he uses as a front to smuggle drugs from the Mexican Juarez cartel. Until the final episodes of Breaking Bad, Saul continues to have the same go-lucky attitude shown in Better Call Saul, mainly interested in profiting while other characters are concerned with life and death. = Season 2 = A prop bench with a \\"Better Call Saul\\" ad After their employee Badger is arrested in an Albuquerque Police sting operation, meth cooks Walter White and Jesse Pinkman hire Saul as their lawyer and consigliere. Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \\"Heisenberg\\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \\"flipping\\", but Saul refuses. Walt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul, initially worried that the two are from Lalo or Nacho, sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \\"In-'N-Out\\" Kilkelly, who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison. Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg. The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school. He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity. Combo, Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness. = Season 3 = To help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. set up for donors to contribute to Walt's chemotherapy, making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke, Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt. Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus. Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income. When Walt's brother-in-law Hank Schrader, a DEA agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul. Saul has his secretary Francesca pose as an Albuquerque Police Department dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank's wife Marie has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it. Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business. Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's brother Tomás. Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade. = Season 4 = Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman on the set of Breaking Bad during the filming of the fourth season, with Emily Rios as Andrea Cantillo Saul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate. Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \\"disappearer\\", a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered. Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash. To protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and Huell to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marco and Leonel Salamanca to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the ricin cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca in a nursing home. Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus. = Season 5  Part 1  Saul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth- producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey and granddaughter Kaylee. Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \\"go bag\\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of methylamine and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.  Part 2  Walt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. As shown in the cold open of the Better Call Saul episode \\"Quite a Ride\\", Saul gathers valuables from his office and gives Francesca a cover story, while she prepares to dispose of shredded documents from Saul's law practice. She agrees to be at a telephone booth on November 12 (Jimmy's birthday) at 3 p.m. to receive a call. Saul gives Francesca cash and an attorney's business card, and tells her that if she needs help she should say \\"Jimmy\\" sent her. Saul and Walt both subsequently contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in Omaha, Nebraska. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha.  Post- Breaking Bad  Though Saul does not appear in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, Ed refers to him when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life. In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar. The season premieres of Better Call Saul open with black-and- white flashforwards that take place after Breaking Bad, showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a Cinnabon store in a shopping mall. These scenes show him reminiscing about his past success in private, but wary of anyone finding out about his previous life in Albuquerque. However, when called out by a taxi driver who recognizes him as Saul, Gene calls up Ed to request another relocation, but then decides mid-call to face the situation himself.  Reception  For the first four seasons of Better Call Saul, Odenkirk was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Odenkirk also received nominations for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series for the first four seasons, winning the award twice. Several critics felt that Bob Odenkirk, who had been nominated for each previous season, was a significant Emmy snub at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

Cognitive flexibility is usually described as one of the executive functions. Two subcategories of cognitive flexibility are task switching and cognitive shifting, depending on whether the change happens unconsciously or consciously, respectively. Cognitive flexibility varies during the lifespan of an individual. In addition, certain conditions such as obsessive–compulsive disorder are associated with reduced cognitive flexibility. Since cognitive flexibility is a vital component of learning, deficits in this area might have other implications. Methods of measuring cognitive flexibility include the A-not-B task, the Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task, the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, and the Stroop Test. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) research has shown that specific brain regions are activated when a person engages in cognitive flexibility tasks. These regions include the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basal ganglia, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Studies conducted with people of various ages and with particular deficits have further informed how cognitive flexibility develops and changes within the brain. Definitions Cognitive flexibility can be seen from a variety of viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is a switch in thinking, whether that is specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one's previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting. Cognitive flexibility varies during the lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as the capacity to shift or switch one's thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically in response to a change in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they are able to successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based on the type of object on the card. Cognitive flexibility has been more broadly described as the ability to adjust one's thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation. Contributing factors Regardless of the specificity of the definition, researchers have generally agreed that cognitive flexibility is a component of executive functioning, higher-order cognition involving the ability to control one's thinking. Executive functioning includes other aspects of cognition, including inhibition, memory, emotional stability, planning, and organization. Cognitive flexibility is highly related with a number of these abilities, including inhibition, planning and working memory. Thus, when an individual is better able to suppress aspects of a stimulus to focus on more important aspects (i.e. inhibit color of object to focus on kind of object), they are also more cognitively flexible. In this sense, they are better at planning, organizing, and at employing particular memory strategies. Researchers have argued that cognitive flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or are in the process of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible. Research has suggested that cognitive flexibility is related to other cognitive abilities, such as fluid intelligence, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. Fluid intelligence, described as the ability to solve problems in new situations, enables fluid reasoning ability. When one is able to reason fluidly, they are in turn more likely to be cognitively flexible. Furthermore, those who are able to be cognitively flexible have been shown to have the ability to switch between and/or simultaneously think about sounds and meanings, which increases their reading fluency and comprehension. Cognitive flexibility has also been shown to be related to one's ability to cope in particular situations. For example, when individuals are better able to shift their thinking from situation to situation they will focus less on stressors within these situations. In general, researchers in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility between the ages of three and five. However, cognitive flexibility has been shown to be a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood. Measures/assessments A variety of assessments are appropriate for distinguishing between different levels of cognitive flexibility at different ages. Below are the common tests used to assess cognitive flexibility in the order of the developmentally appropriate age. A-not-B task In the A-not-B task, children are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted to search for the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial and while the child is watching, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy. Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task In the Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task (DCCS), children are initially asked to sort cards by a single dimension (such as color), and are subsequently required to alter their strategy to sort cards based on a second dimension (such as shape). Typically, three-year-old children are able to sort cards based on a single dimension, but are unable to switch to sort the cards based on a second dimension. However, five-year-old children are able to sort cards based on one dimension and can then switch to sorting cards on a second dimension. Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task In the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, children are shown cards and asked to sort them based on two different dimensions (e.g. by color, such as yellow and blue, and object type, such as animals and food) simultaneously into four piles within a matrix (e.g. yellow animals, yellow foods, blue animals and blue foods). This task appears to be more difficult as research has shown that seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the two dimensions simultaneously. These children focused on the two dimensions separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based on these two dimensions simultaneously. This demonstrates an increase in cognitive flexibility between the ages of seven and eleven. Wisconsin Card Sorting Test Wisconsin Card Sorting Test The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is used to determine an individual's competence in abstract reasoning, and the ability to change problem-solving strategies when needed. In this test, a number of cards are presented to the participants. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one to one of the previous cards. Typically, children between ages nine and eleven demonstrate the cognitive flexibility needed for this test. Stroop Test The Stroop Test is also known as the Color-word Naming Test. In this measure, there are three types of cards in the deck. The \\"color card\\" displays patches of different colors, which participants are asked to identify as quickly as possible. The \\"word card,\\" displays the names of colors printed in black and white ink, which participants are again asked name as quickly as possible. The final card type is the \\"color-word card\\", which displays the names of the colors printed in an ink of a conflicting color (e.g. the word RED would be printed in yellow), and requires participants to name the ink colors while ignoring the conflicting color names. The basic score on each card is the total time (in seconds) that the participant takes to respond verbally. Typically, naming the color of the word takes longer and results in more errors when the color of the ink does not match the name of the color. In this situation, adults tend to take longer to respond than children because adults are more sensitive to the actual color of the word and thus are more likely to be influenced by it when naming the conflicting color word printed. Neural underpinnings The mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility have been explored extensively using various methods. Human studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revealed a variety of distinct regions of the brain that work in concert from which flexibility could be predicted reliably, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basal ganglia, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). The regions active during engagement of cognitive flexibility depend on the task and various factors involved in flexibility that are used to assess the behavior, as flexible thinking requires aspects of inhibition, attention, working memory, response selection, and goal maintenance. Several studies using task switching paradigms have demonstrated the complexities of the network involved in cognitive flexibility. Activation of the dorsolateral PFC has been shown during resolution of interference of irrelevant task sets. Another study further extended these results by demonstrating that the level of abstractness of the switch type influenced recruitment of differing regions in the PFC depending on whether the participant was asked to make a cognitive set switch, a response switch, or a stimulus or perceptual switch. A set switch would require switching between task rules, as with the WCST, and is considered to be the most abstract. A response switch would require different response mapping, such as circle right button and square left button and vice versa. Lastly, a stimulus or perceptual set switch would require a simple switch between a circle and a square. Activation is mediated by the level of abstractness of the set switch in an anterior to posterior fashion within the PFC, with the most anterior activations elicited by set switches and the most posterior activations resulting from stimulus or perceptual switches. The basal ganglia is active during response selection and the PPC, along with the inferior frontal junction are active during representation and updating of task sets called domain general switching. Development Children can be strikingly inflexible when assessed using traditional tests of cognitive flexibility, but this does not come as a surprise considering the many cognitive processes involved in the mental flexibility, and the various developmental trajectories of such abilities. With age, children generally show increases in cognitive flexibility which is likely a product of the protracted development of the frontoparietal network evident in adults, with maturing synaptic connections, increased myelination and regional gray matter volume occurring from birth to mid-twenties. Deficits Diminished cognitive flexibility has been noted in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as anorexia nervosa, obsessive–compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and in a subset of people with ADHD. Each of these disorders exhibit varying aspects of cognitive inflexibility. For example, those with obsessive–compulsive disorder experience difficulty shifting their attentional focus as well as inhibiting motor responses. Children with autism show a slightly different profile with deficits in adjusting to changing task contingencies, while often maintaining the ability to respond in the face of competing responses. Potential treatments may lie in neurochemical modulation. Juveniles with Anorexia nervosa have marked decreases in set-shifting abilities, possibly associated with incomplete maturation of prefrontal cortices associated with malnutrition. One can also consider people with addictions to be limited in cognitive flexibility, in that they are unable to flexibly respond to stimuli previously associated with the drug. Aging The elderly often experience deficits in cognitive flexibility. The aging brain undergoes physical and functional changes including a decline in processing speed, central sensory functioning, white matter integrity, and brain volume. Regions associated with cognitive flexibility such as the PFC and PC atrophy, or shrink, with age, but also show greater task-related activation in older individuals when compared to younger individuals. This increase in blood flow is potentially related to the evidence that atrophy heightens blood flow and metabolism, which is measured as the BOLD response, or blood-oxygen-level dependence, with fMRI. Studies suggest that aerobic exercise and training can have plasticity inducing effects that could potentially serve as an intervention in old age that combat the decline in executive function. Implications for education and general learning=Educational applications Cognitive flexibility and other executive function skills are crucial to success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for one to two years significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self- discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum. Further indicative of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students' ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt what they have learned to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the Common Core State Standards Initiative, a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom \\"high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.\\" This guideline is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain. =Impact on teaching and curriculum design= An alternative educational approach informed by cognitive flexibility is hypertext, which is frequently computer-supported instruction. Computers allow for complex data to be presented in a multidimensional and coherent format, allowing users to access that data as needed. The most widely used example of hypertext is the Internet, which dynamically presents information in terms of interconnection (e.g. hyperlinks). Hypertext documents, therefore, include nodes – bits of information – and links, the pathways between these nodes. Applications for teacher education have involved teacher-training sessions based on video instruction, whereby novice teachers viewed footage of master teachers conducting a literacy workshop. In this example, the novice teachers received a laserdisc of the course content, a hypertext document that allowed the learners to access content in a self-directed manner. These cognitive flexibility hypertexts (CFH) provide a \\"three-dimensional\\" and \\"open-ended\\" representation of material for learners, enabling them to incorporate new information and form connections with preexisting knowledge. While further research is needed to determine the efficacy of CFH as an instructional tool, classrooms where cognitive flexibility theory is applied in this manner are hypothesized to result in students more capable of transferring knowledge across domains. Researchers in the field advocate a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According to this process, a teacher initially poses a single question in a number of ways. Next, students discuss the problem with the teacher and amongst themselves, asking questions. In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution. =Learning applications beyond the classroom= A vastly different application can be seen in the study of cognitive flexibility and video games. Examining the trait under the guise of \\"mental flexibility\\", Dutch researchers observed that players of first-person shooter games (e.g. Call of Duty, Battlefield) exhibited greater \\"mental flexibility\\" on a series of measures than did non-gamers. See also: The researchers posit that, while video game play may be controversial due to frequently graphic content, harnessing the effect of such games could lead to similar gains in various populations (e.g. the elderly, who face cognitive decline) and is therefore socially relevant. Several online programs marketed to those seeking to increase cognitive ability have been created to enhance \\"brain fitness\\", including cognitive flexibility.

Sagami Depot is home to the 35th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion (CSSB), Defense Commissary Agency Central Distribution Center, Defense Logistics Agency for US forces in Japan, and Army Medical Storage. History Sagami General Depot currently occupies the grounds of a former Japanese Imperial Army installation which opened in 1935 as the Sixth Arsenal under Colonel Ikeda as a branch of the Tokyo First Army Arsenal. In 1936 the Imperial Army made the arsenal a separate activity and renamed it Sagami Army Arsenal. The primary function was manufacturing armaments and weapons, mostly tanks, for the Japanese Army. Sagami Depot was also the test bed for the development of the 120-ton “O-I” experimental heavy tank as well as manufacturing balloon incendiary devices which Japanese forces launched from Chiba to start fires in the west coast region of the U.S. In September 1945, Sagami was occupied by the U.S. Army 5th Cavalry Regiment. The installation played a major role in the support of U.S. forces during the Korean War. In 1957 the Army began to scale back operations at Sagami General Depot and U.S. Army Supply and Maintenance Activity (which performed maintenance and repair of heavy equipment and tanks) was inactivated after the Vietnam War. Today, the installation continues to be used as a U.S. Army logistics and supply facility continuing to honor its commitment to Japan’s defense. From 1935 to the end of World War II, this location was known as the Sagami Army Arsenal, where Mitsubishi developed and manufactured tanks for use by the Imperial Japanese Army. In September 2015, land for the former housing area was returned to Japan with a portion designated for joint use. At around 12:45 a.m., August 24, 2015, there were reported explosions at the depot in a storage building containing tanks of nitrogen, Freon, oxygen and compressed air.

History May Day was sold directly to Smart Set before Fitzgerald had a literary agent (later Harold Ober). It is noted that Fitzgerald based some of the events on those he experienced in New York City.May Day: An Introduction The city is detailed as both a source of unfathomable creative inspiration and horrid realities. The story is noteworthy for its length, the familiar themes of lost youth and wealth as well as two distinct yet interrelated plots. All were aspects Fitzgerald would revisit throughout his literary career. Fitzgerald described the story as illustrating a \\"general hysteria...that inaugurated the Jazz Age...\\" During the story a Jewish man is beat up by a crowd as he expounds socialist rhetoric. Fitzgerald, however, was not an anti-semite, and his characterizing of the Jewish man can be seen as a commentary of the brutality of the crowd contrasted with the man's wit and fervor.Notes on F.

History  The province is inhabited by the Kikuyu who are part of the Kenya Eastern Bantu. During Kenya's colonization by the British, much of the province was regarded as part of the 'White Highlands', for the exclusive use of the settler community. Therefore it saw political activity from the local communities who felt that they had an ancestral right to the land. This tension culminated in the 1950s with the Mau Mau rebellion; it saw the region placed under a state of emergency and the arrest of many prominent political leaders.

References  Coast Province covers over 80,000 km2 in the south-eastern part of Kenya, constituting about 15% of the country's land area. Most of the province's population resides within 100 km of the Indian Ocean, although large areas of the province are up to 400 km from the coast. The population is estimated at over 2 million inhabitants, or about 7% of Kenya's total population of 28.8 million (1997 estimate). Coast Province is home to a large number of ethnic groups; an estimated two-thirds of the population are members of related ethnic groups referred to collectively as the Mijikenda. The Mijikenda have a history in the area stretching back at least two centuries (Waaijenberg 1994). The other one-third of the province's inhabitants are migrants from Kenya's highlands. These migrants are primarily from the Machakos area of Eastern Province, the densely populated areas of western Kenya, and from central Kenya. These migrants generally have a stronger tradition of dairy cattle keeping than the Mijikenda. Increasingly, the population of the province lives in urban areas; at present about 45% live in Mombasa and other urban centres.

The initiative was developed by the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology (S&T;), and currently operates as a pilot in eight states — Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Virginia and Tennessee — with plans to incorporate additional states. Virtual USA is part of the DHS' Open Government plan, which is part of the Obama administration's goal to promote a greater amount of transparency and openness between the government and citizens. Purpose and overview The stated goal of Virtual USA is to aggregate existing data, from federal, state, local, tribal, and other information into a common operating picture to assist first responders during emergencies. Virtual USA: *Virtual USA utilizes current information-sharing platforms to permit new and existing technologies to exchange information with one another. *Virtual USA is based on the needs of local and state first responders to manage data access within their own jurisdictions and to share information with relevant jurisdictions across the United States. *Virtual USA is not limited to information exchanges between two agencies; instead, the initiative fosters information sharing among all federal, state, local and tribal authorities. *Virtual USA uses open data standards and open-source software, more states and localities are able to join this information exchange project. *Virtual USA allows Americans in their own communities to contribute information—in real-time to support the efforts of police, fire and emergency management officials during disasters and recovery efforts.

It is a four-hour drive from Nakuru town. Administratively, it is headed by a chief (National Government), to be assisted by a village administrator (recruited by the County Government of Turkana). The village lies to the West of Mount Silale in the floor of the Great Rift Valley at the head of the Suguta Valley. The Suguta River emanates from hot springs just east of the village, and is joined by the Kapedo River flowing from the West. The village, occupied by Turkana people and traces of Pokot people (living in squalor of a slum) is in a hot semi-desert area. Most houses are semi-permanent, made of iron sheets on roof and mud on the walls. There are also houses made of mud and palm leaves. However, due to the prospective LAPPSET, the village has a number of permanent house. Kapedo is a trading center with a few shops selling basic goods such as flour, tea, sugar and kerosene. There is very little agricultural land, so the people mainly depend on raising Cows, goats, sheep and camels. Conflict with the neighbouring Pokot people creates risk in herding. The village is home to three learning institutions: Kapedo Mixed Boarding Primary School, Kapedo Girls Primary School and the Kapedo Mixed Secondary School, which was completed and had a staff of eight, mostly BOM teachers over 180 pupils. The capacity of the school is much higher but few students can afford even the modest fees. As of 2011 the Kapedo Sub-District Hospital had 28 beds and four cots. It provided in-patient and out-patient services related to maternity, HIV and tuberculosis. Kapedo has high potential but it is limited mostly due to the defunct hydro-electric power plant that has been desolate for years since the departure of the Finnish missionaries. The 'mission' coined for the Kapedo Mixed Primary School, Hospital, Full Gospel Church, the garage and the guest house were the heavily hit after the redundancy of the HEP project. Due to insecurity from the neighboring Turkana community and being a border village, Kapedo is a host to a platoon of General Service Unit, an Administration Police camp and a number of National Police Reservists.

It is a nocturnal pelagic predator that feeds almost exclusively on the endemic amphipod Hyalella montezuma, which it detects using passive sonar and swallows whole. Description Adults of M. montezuma may reach a length of including the suckers at the front and rear. Distribution Montezuma Well M. montezuma is closely related to the genus Erpobdella, which includes species that are widespread across North America from Alaska to Mexico. However, M. montezuma is only known to occur in a single pool, Montezuma Well, in the Montezuma Castle National Monument in Yavapai County, Arizona. Ecology Montezuma Well due to a high carbon dioxide level in the water is unable to support a population of fish, leaving an ecological niche of predator-free open water. Although there are a number of species of invertebrates living in the well, the diet of M. montezuma consists almost entirely of the endemic amphipod Hyalella montezuma. Behavior M. montezuma is nocturnal, resting at the bottom of the well during the day, when predatory waterfowl are present. As night falls, the leeches swim towards the surface and hunt amphipods near the surface; this is the only instance of a leech hunting in open water. Prey are detected by passive sonar, and swallowed whole. This pattern of diel vertical migration by a leech is only known to occur in Montezuma Well. Life cycle Like many other leeches, M. montezuma is hermaphroditic. Sexual reproduction results in two individuals fertilizing each other, and the resulting eggs are placed in a nutrient-filled cocoon. The cocoon is placed deep enough to avoid the attention of ducks and other predators, and the eggs hatch into self- sufficient juveniles.

This expression linked the Italian political parties which had been actors in the drafting and approval of the Italian Constitution of 1948. The arch therefore included the Christian Democracy (DC), the Italian Communist Party (PCI), the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, the Italian Liberal Party and the Italian Republican Party, then practically all major parties except the Monarchist National Party and, particularly, the Italian Social Movement (MSI), which had no Members of Parliament (MPs) in the Constituent AssemblyThe first MSI's MPs were elected by the election of 1948, held after the constitutional approval. and did not share the anti-fascist values contained in the Constitution itself.The Action Party, which had contributed the wording of the constitution, disbanded well before the political debate to formulate this expression. According to Claudio PavoneClaude Peacock, The legacy of civil war and the new institutional framework by P. Bevilacqua. the arch was the heir of the constitutional system of government led by the National Liberation Committee, maintaining the structure for a long time even after the ouster of the center-left government in 1947. The Constitutional arch was also one of the support points used as motivation, during the years of lead, from politicians who demanded a government of national unity including the PCI fully into the leadership of the country. The Constitutional Assembly had the effect of creating an asymmetry between the forces of the left opposition (included within the Constitution) and of right opposition (not the same) than the governments of the so-called First Republic that until 1994 were based on DC. Indeed, the PCI, despite being at opposition permanently since 1947, was an active component of the policy making process, both nationally (especially during the parliamentary legislative committees) and in local administrative areas, such as governments of regions, provinces, while the MSI, more or less everywhere, was confined to the margins of political life. One of the last acts of political expression in the constitutional election was the President of the Republic of Sandro Pertini, elected on July 8, 1978, receiving the largest majority in presidential vote in Italian history. The theory of the constitutional arch, during the seventh parliamentary terms (1976–1979), was challenged by the Socialist Party, led by Bettino Craxi as his new secretary, who began to introduce political discourse in the demand for constitutional reforms, a hypothesis until that time always firmly rejected by any party of the arch, and was generally considered completed when Craxi, during which he held the office of Prime Minister of Italy, found in favor of a hypothetical chance for MSI to enter into a coalition government as a sign of relaxing at the party offered the chairmanship of the Board of elections to the Italian Chamber of Deputies. The arch theory finally ended in 1994 when Silvio Berlusconi found the Pole of Good Government, forming a new government which included post-fascist politicians.

He served the Diocese of Iowa as coadjutor bishop and diocesan bishop from 1988–2001, and as the Deputy for Ecumenical and Interreligious Relations for the Episcopal Church from 2001-2009. He then served as the Assistant Bishop of the Diocese of Chicago from November 2011 through December 2015 before retiring. Early life and ministry Epting was born in Greenville, South Carolina and was raised in Orlando, Florida. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Florida, a Master of Divinity degree from Seabury-Western Theological Seminary and a Master of Sacred Theology degree from General Theological Seminary. He did his Clinical Pastoral Education at the University of Iowa. He married Pamela Flagg in 1969 and they were married until her death in 2000. In 2001, he married Susanne Watson, a deacon. Epting was ordained a deacon in April, 1972, and a priest in November of the same year. Epting served 16 years in parish ministry in the Diocese of Central Florida. He had been a curate at Holy Trinity Church in Melbourne, a vicar at parishes in Mulberry and Lakeland, and a Canon Residentiary at St. John’s Cathedral in Jacksonville. Diocese of Iowa Epting was serving as rector at St. Mark's Church in Cocoa, Florida when he was elected coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Iowa. Epting was consecrated a bishop on September 27, 1988 by Edmond L. Browning, the Presiding Bishop, with William H. Folwell, Bishop of Central Florida, and Walter C. Righter, Bishop of Iowa. He was the 830th Episcopal bishop consecrated in the United States. Nineteen bishops attended the liturgy, including Ted Luscombe, Bishop of Brechin and former Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, and Bernard Mkhabela, Bishop of Swaziland. Epting succeeded Righter as Bishop of Iowa upon Righter's retirement at the end of 1988. During his episcopate in Iowa he renewed the diaconate, spiritual formation and ecumenical relations. In 1989 the diocese began participation in Education for Ministry, an extension program of the School of Theology of the University of the South. The diocese was organized into deaneries in June 1992. The same year St. Paul’s Church in Des Moines became the diocese’s liturgical cathedral and Trinity Cathedral in Davenport became the historical cathedral of the diocese. The diocese lost a couple of its institutions in the 1990s. In 1994 St. Luke’s Hospital in Davenport merged with Mercy Hospital and became Genesis Health System. The Episcopal Center for Camps and Conferences was sold in 1996 because of its deteriorated condition and the cost to repair and replace the facilities. Epting served in leadership positions in the state council of churches and Ecumenical Ministries in Iowa. He also chaired the Episcopal Church's writing team for Called to Common Mission, which established full communion between the Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. In 1998, Epting attended the Lambeth Conference in England. He joined with 145 other bishops who disagreed with resolutions on the ordination of women, ordination of homosexuals and blessing same-sex unions. He signed a resolution affirming gay Anglicans and recognized the hurt that was caused by the passage of the resolutions. He also continued to ordain and deploy women as deacons and priests in Iowa.  Deputy for Ecumenical and Interreligious Relations  In 2001, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, Frank Griswold, asked Epting to serve as the church’s Deputy for Ecumenical and Interreligious Relations. It was the first time a bishop served in this capacity. He continued in the position after Katharine Jefferts Schori became the Presiding Bishop. In this position, Epting served on the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches and the Governing Board of the National Council of Churches. He staffed the bilateral dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church and Presbyterian Church, the Lutheran-Episcopal Coordinating Committee, the Jewish-Christian dialogue of the National Council of Churches, and the Inter Anglican Standing Commission on Ecumenical Relations. He retired as the church’s ecumenical officer at the end of 2009. Later life On January 1, 2010, Epting became the interim dean at Trinity Cathedral in Davenport, Iowa. He became the Assistant Bishop of the Diocese of Chicago in January 2012. In late October, 2015 the Diocese of Chicago announced that Epting was planning to retire at the end of December.

Although the genus Tectona is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, primarily Indonesia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, the cultivation of plantation teak is economically viable in other tropical regions such as Central America. Renewable cultivation and harvesting Due to its durability, natural water-resistant qualities and striking wood grain, teak has historically been used in the manufacture of outdoor furniture, boat decks, and other carpentry goods which are to be exposed to the elements for long periods of time. Due to the high demand for this timber and the reasonably short growth period of teak trees, sustainable teak production is currently underway on plantations across many dry tropical climates across Costa Rica and Mexico. Given the proper conditions, teak can be grown without artificial fertilizers or irrigation; this is thought to give plantation teak the look and durability of old-growth teak from Southeast Asia. Plantation teak is considered a renewable resource, as it is harvested and managed to produce a sustainable supply. Plantation timber also offers the benefit of reduced shipping costs and emissions. Since teak can be grown throughout the world's dry-tropical zones, plantations offer a geographically closer source of teak. The Forest Stewardship Council has granted certification to a number of sustainable teak plantations in Latin America. Conflict teak The destruction of Asia's old-growth teak forests along with the known human rights violations in the region have led some to refer to Asiatic teak as \\"conflict teak.\\" In 1962, the democratic republic called the Union of Burma was overthrown by a military coup a replaced by a military junta, infamous for human rights abuses and using to put down protests. In 1989, the Burmese government changed the country's name to Myanmar, though teak coming from that nation is typically still referred to as \\"Burmese teak.\\" Plantation versus old growth There exists a common myth that plantation teak exhibits lower densities than timber grown in old-growth forests. However, studies from the United States Forest Service USDA and the Forest Research Institute at Dehra Dun, India found no significant relationship between the growth rate of plantation teak and its density. However, to match the wood grain of Burmese teak, some forestry experts recommend a process called slow growth cultivation. By finding regions that closely mimic the precipitation and soil characteristics of Burma, plantation teak may be cultivated without irrigation or fertilizers. Thus, the growth rate is similar to that of Burmese teak, and teak plantations can produce timber that is nearly identical to Asian teak.

It neighbours the Njeng'u region located in one of Kenya's largest coffee growing zones, and thus has one of Kenya's raw coffee berry processing facilities. The Sasini Coffee Plantation Facility has its own communal facility where fresh coffee berries are processed and dried for further processing later on. Kihuyo and the surrounding areas including Njeng'u also practice mixed-farming. Kihuyo Region has two major Public Schools: Kihuyo Primary School and Kihuyo Secondary School. In addition to this, Kihuyo also has one private academy school: Muhoya Academy . Kihuyo's religion is primarily Christian. Major churches in Kihuyo are the Kihuyo Catholic Church, African Independent Church (AIPCA), Pentecostal Church of East Africa (PCEA)- Kihuyo Local Church and Full Gospel Church. No other religious groups make a significant impact. Kihuyo Shopping center is a small marketplace characterized with small stone buildings, mostly single-storeyed and an open public space; standing in the market center one has a grand view of Nyeri hill. Kihuyo's water sources include Nyeri Water and Sewerage Company (NYEWASCO) and two rivers: the Muraria (Ihururu) river to the south and the Muringato river to the North.  History  The first permanent inhabitants of Kihuyo first arrived in the period beginning the mid 19th century, having migrated northwards from the larger Tetu. At this time, Karuri wa Gakure then the chief in Murang'a was waging constant war against his perceived enemies in order to consolidate power, and as thus forced many rival chiefs to flee elsewhere with their people to where land was available. Kihuyo as is today began with rather traditional settlement of Chief Ndiyuini and his brother Ngambi with their wives, taking up land bordering Chief Wambugu wa Mathangania territory towards Nyeri and Chief Nderi Wa Ng'ombe towards Tetu. Around this period, Mbogo, a wealthy man with many wives and animals also migrated to Kihuyo from the higher areas of Tetu, in search of pasture and land for his people and animals. Even today, Mbari ya Murathimi and Mbari ya Mbogo are the largest clans among the inhabitants of Kihuyo. Beginning early 20th century, with the arrival of the Italian missionaries at Mathari and the British colonialists, Ndiyuini 1,050 Acres of his land to allow the development of the missionaries station. This includes land today occupied by Nyeri High School, Kamwenja Teachers training college and St. Pauls Seminary, Consolata Mission Hospital-Mathari as well as tea and coffee plantations. That land has been a source of conflict and disillusionment among the present day descendants of Murathimi who maintain that Ndiyuini was duped to cede customary land to the detriment of their descendants who today occupy only a fraction of what used to be their land. Famously in the year 2006, angry Kihuyo residents invaded the coffee plantation, now owned by the Catholic Arch-diocese(consolata mission) of Nyeri burned several acres of coffee. Today, other inhabitants of Kihuyo occupy a smaller village upper west bordering the Aberdares National Park, an area called Nyarugumu. Nyarugumu was a settlement formed in the 1960s by Kenya's new independent government to resettle squatters from colonial villages from all over Nyeri, including many from Mukurwe-ini, Nyeri and Othaya  Culture  Gikuyu is the dominant language in Kihuyo, although most residents are also conversant with Swahili and to some extent English. Due to the relative seclusion of Kihuyo from the rest of Nyeri as a result of the Coffee and tea plantation buffer, there are not many visitors generally, although the people are warm and kind to visitors  Economic Activities  Residents of Kihuyo are primarily farmers. Farming activities include dairy farming, tea, coffee and other subsistence crops like maize, potatoes, beans and horticulture. The main cooperative societies with operations in the area Mutheka Farmers Cooperative Society for the coffee farmers, which is the most dominant cash crop in the area and Ihururu Dairy Cooperative for the dairy farmers.

He was a member of Frank O'Farrell's Weymouth team that won the Southern League title in 1964–65 and of the Darlington team promoted from the Fourth Division the following season. He played as a wing half in the early part of his career, later as a forward. Football career Hutchinson was born in Sheffield, the son of former Bournemouth, Lincoln City and Oldham Athletic footballer Jimmy Hutchinson. Access 1965–66 season statistics via Season Stats dropdown menu. He began his football career as an amateur with Bolton Wanderers, but never appeared for the first team, and moved on to Chesterfield in 1953. He made his debut on 19 March 1955 in a 2–1 home win against Halifax Town in the Football League Third Division North. He spent seven years with Chesterfield, mainly playing as a wing half, before moving on to Derby County of the Second Division for a fee of £2,000 plus two players. Derby used Hutchinson as an inside left. After his second appearance for the first team produced his first goal, the Derby Evening Telegraph's reporter felt he \\"merit[ed] further opportunities\\". He scored again in the next game, and in the next, despite his inexperience in the position, he was described as \\"nearly always seem[ing] to have space in which to receive the ball; many of his precise passes set up movements which betrayed the Colliers' defenders into a series of thoughtless clearances, and he was a constant menace near goal\\". He went on to score 51 goals from 107 League games in four seasons with Derby. Transfer-listed early on in the 1963–64 season, once returned to the first team his performances as both creator and scorer of goals helped Derby avoid relegation. Hutchinson signed for Southern League club Weymouth, then managed by Frank O'Farrell, in July 1964 for a £6,000 fee. Hutchinson's goalscoring was prolific. From 56 matches in the 1964–65 season he produced 46 goals, eleven of which came in January 1965, when he scored in each of the seven games Weymouth played that month. His 36 goals in League competition contributed not only to a Southern League winners' medal, but also a £2,000 move back into the Football League. Six months with Lincoln City in the Fourth Division was enough to make him their leading scorer for the 1965–66 season, with 20 goals from 27 games in all competitions (18 from 24 in the League). A move to Fourth Division rivals Darlington followed, \\"signed in February 1966 to add goals to the promotion push\\". The transfer fee of £5,000 was high by Fourth Division standards of the time, but the push for promotion – the club's first in more than 40 years – was successful and earned manager Lol Morgan and his team legendary status among Darlington supporters. Hutchinson played only 30 League games for Darlington, which produced 14 goals, before moving on in November 1966 to yet another Fourth Division club, Halifax Town, for a £2,000 fee. At the end of that season he continued his tour of the Fourth Division, joining Rochdale for a fee of £2,500. A year later he dropped into non-League football with Bangor City, founder members of the Northern Premier League. Hutchinson died in Rotherham in 2005 at the age of 69.
