A line consists of halftones that is built up by physical ink dots made by the printer device to create different tones. Specifically LPI is a measure of how close together the lines in a halftone grid are. The quality of printer device or screen determines how high the LPI will be. High LPI indicates greater detail and sharpness. Printed magazines and newspapers often use a halftone system. Typical newsprint paper is not very dense, and has relatively high dot gain or color bleeding, so newsprint is usually around 85 LPI. Higher-quality paper, such as that used in commercial magazines, has less dot gain, and can range up to 300 LPI with quality glossy (coated) paper. In order to effectively utilize the entire range of available LPI in a halftone system, an image selected for printing generally must have 1.5 to 2 times as many samples per inch (SPI). For instance, if the target output device is capable of printing at 100 LPI, an optimal range for a source image would be 150 to 200 SPI. Using fewer SPI than this would not make full use of the printer's available LPI; using more SPI than this would exceed the capability of the printer, and quality would be effectively lost.

The letter \\"F\\" supposedly stands for \\"Father\\".Michio Kaku: The Universe Is a Symphony of Vibrating Strings - YouTube Compactifications F-theory is formally a 12-dimensional theory, but the only way to obtain an acceptable background is to compactify this theory on a two-torus. By doing so, one obtains type IIB superstring theory in 10 dimensions. The SL(2,Z) S-duality symmetry of the resulting type IIB string theory is manifest because it arises as the group of large diffeomorphisms of the two-dimensional torus. More generally, one can compactify F-theory on an elliptically fibered manifold (elliptic fibration), i.e. a fiber bundle whose fiber is a two-dimensional torus (also called an elliptic curve). For example, a subclass of the K3 manifolds is elliptically fibered, and F-theory on a K3 manifold is dual to heterotic string theory on a two-torus. Also, the moduli spaces of those theories should be isomorphic. The large number of semirealistic solutions to string theory referred to as the string theory landscape, with 10^{272,000} elements or so, is dominated by F-theory compactifications on Calabi‚ÄìYau four-folds. There are about 10^{15} of those solutions consistent with the Standard Model of particle physics.

Extra time dimensions F-theory, as it has metric signature (11,1), as needed for the Euclidean interpretation of the compactification spaces (e.g. the four-folds), is not a \\"two-time\\" theory of physics. However, the signature of the two additional dimensions is somewhat ambiguous due to their infinitesimal character. For example, the supersymmetry of F-theory on a flat background corresponds to type IIB (i.e. (2,0)) supersymmetry with 32 real supercharges which may be interpreted as the dimensional reduction of the chiral real 12-dimensional supersymmetry if its spacetime signature is (10,2). In (11,1) dimensions, the minimum number of components would be 64.

A humanoid figure consisting of stacked white tyres, the mascot was introduced at the Lyon Exhibition of 1894 where the Michelin brothers had a stand, and is one of the world's oldest trademarks. The slogan Nunc est bibendum (Now is the time to drink) is taken from Horace's Odes (book I, ode xxxvii, line 1). He is also referred to as Bib or Bibelobis. Michelin dominated the French tyre industry for decades and remains a leading player in the market. It was one of the leading advertisers; to this day its famous guidebooks are widely used by travellers. Bibendum was depicted visually as a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic exponent of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America's superior factory system, but to patriotically avoid using the \\"inferior\\" products of those factories. As automobiles became available to the middle classes, Michelin advertising likewise shifted downscale, and its restaurant and hotel guides likewise covered a broader range of price categories.Stephen L. Harp, Marketing Michelin. Advertising and Cultural Identity in Twentieth-Century France (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001) Development O'Galop\\" of Bibendum, the Michelin Man, produced in 1898. While attending the Universal and Colonial Exposition in Lyon in 1894, √âdouard and Andr√© Michelin noticed a stack of tyres that suggested to √âdouard the figure of a man without arms. Four years later, Andr√© met French cartoonist Marius Rossillon, popularly known as O'Galop, who showed him a rejected image he had created for a Munich brewery ‚Äî a large, regal figure holding a huge glass of beer and quoting Horace's phrase Nunc est bibendum (\\"Now is the time for drinking\\").Horace, Odes, Book 1, Poem 37.. Andr√© immediately suggested replacing the man with a figure made from tyres. Thus O'Galop transformed the earlier image into Michelin's symbol. Today, Bibendum is one of the world's most recognised trademarks, representing Michelin in over 150 countries. The 1898 poster showed him offering the toast to his scrawny competitors with a glass full of road hazards, with the title and the tag (\\"That is to say: Here's to your health. The Michelin tyre drinks up obstacles\\"). The character's glass is filled with nails and broken glass. The implication is that Michelin tyres will easily take on road hazards. The company used this basic poster format for fifteen years, adding its latest products to the table in front of the figure. It is unclear when the word \\"Bibendum\\" came to be the name of the character himself. At the latest, it was in 1908, when Michelin commissioned Curnonsky to write a newspaper column signed \\"Bibendum\\". In 1922, Michelin ran a contest for \\"naming the Michelin Tire Man\\" in the United States.advertisement, Saturday Evening Post 194:56 (March 4, 1922), p. 53 From 1912 onwards, tyres became black in colour because carbon was added as a preservative and a strengthener to the basic rubber material. Before then, they were a gray-white or light and translucent-beige colour. Bibendum's appearance also changed, becoming black. Though Michelin briefly featured him that way in several print ads, it quickly changed back his appearance, citing printing and aesthetic issues for the change, and not racial concerns as commonly believed. The name of the plump tyre-man has entered the language to describe someone obese or wearing comically bulky clothing (e.g. \\"How can I wrap up warmly without looking like the Michelin Man?\\"). Bibendum's shape has changed over the years. O'Galop's logo was based on bicycle tyres, wore pince- nez glasses with lanyard, and smoked a cigar. By the 1980s, Bibendum was being shown running, and in 1998, his 100th anniversary, a slimmed-down version became the company's new logo. He had long since given up the cigar and pince- nez. The slimming of the logo reflected lower-profile, smaller tyres of modern cars. Bib even had a similar-looking puppy as a companion when the duo were CGI animated for recent American television advertisements. A history of the emblem was written by Olivier Darmon and published in 1997: Le Grand Si√®cle de Bibendum; Paris: Ho√´beke.Also in English and German: One Hundred Years of Michelin Man; translated from the French by Bernard Besserglik; Paris: Ho√´beke, 1997; Michelin Man: 100 years of Bibendum; London: Conran Octopus, 1998.--Bibendum: ein Jahrhundert Geschichte; aus dem Franz√∂sischen von Herta Luise Ott. In popular culture Bibendum is one of several advertising characters featured in this advertisement from 1920 The \\"Bibendum chair\\" was designed by Eileen Gray in 1925. Cayce Pollard, the main character of William Gibson's novel Pattern Recognition, has a strong aversion to corporate brands and logos. The sight of Bibendum in particular gives her panic attacks. Bibendum made a brief guest appearance in the Asterix series, as the chariot- wheel dealer in certain translations, including the English one, of Asterix in Switzerland. (The original French version used the Gaulish warrior mascot of French service-station company Antar.) Michelin sued the performance artist Momus for releasing a song about the trademarked Michelin Man. French reggae band Tryo sang about Bibendum on their album Grain de Sable. ('Mr Bibendum, he is truly enormous, Mr Bibendum; happiness personified'). In the 2009 animated, Academy Award-winning satire Logorama, a series of Bibendums play police detectives, a sheriff, and a squad of SWAT personnel who all work together to try to bring down a psychotic, ultraviolent criminal played by Ronald McDonald. In Season 17 Episode 6 of Family Guy, \\"Stand by Meg\\", the Michelin Man was \\"murdered\\" by Chris Griffin on behalf of \\"Mr. Firestone\\". He later shows up at the Griffin house with the police, pointing to Chris as \\"the one who popped me\\". In the French dubbed version of Ghostbusters the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is named \\"Bibendum Chamallow\\" (\\"chamallow\\" was originally a confectionery marketed in France under this name, which vaguely resembles the American marshmallow). LEGO released the Stay Puft Bibendum Chamallow minifigure in its 2015 edition of the fun pack set. References External links * Bibimage.com, Unofficial site dedicated to Bibendum.

It lies in the Chamoli District of Uttarakhand. Its appearance resembles a giant pyramid topped by a flat summit area with two peaks. Climbing Due to its position near the Tibetan Plateau, Kamet is remote and not as accessible as some Himalayan peaks. It also receives a great deal of wind from the Plateau. However, by modern standards, it is a relatively straightforward ascent for such a high mountain. Early explorers of the region faced long approach marches of around from Ranikhet through dense mountain forest; access is easier today. While attempts to climb Kamet began in 1855, the first ascent was not made until 1931 by Frank Smythe, Eric Shipton, R.L. Holdsworth and Lewa Sherpa, members of a British expedition. Kamet was the first summit over to be climbed, and was the highest summit reached until the first ascent of Nanda Devi five years later. (However, far higher non-summit altitudes had been reached on the north side of Mount Everest in the 1920s.) The standard route begins from the East Kamet (or Purbi Kamet) Glacier, ascending via Meade's Col (c. 7,100m/23,300 ft), the saddle between Kamet and its northern outlier Abi Gamin. From Meade's Col the route ascends the northeast edge of the north face. The ascent to Meade's col involves steep gullies, a rock wall, and several glacier climbs. Five camps are usually placed en route. The final ascent to the summit involves steep snow, possibly icy. Neighboring and subsidiary peaks Kamet (left), Mandir Parbat (second from left), Mana, Deoban, Nilgiri from Khullara Campsite Kamet (left), Mandir Parbat (second from left), Mana, Deoban, Nilgiri from Kuari Top Kamet is surrounded by three principal neighboring or subsidiary peaks: * Mukut Parbat, 7,242 m (23,760 ft) Ranked 97th, prominence = 840 m, , northwest of Kamet. First ascent 1951 (see below). The lower of Mukut Parbat's twin summit has an elevation of 7,130 m (23,392 ft). * Abi Gamin, 7,355m (24,130 ft), prominence = 217 m , north-northeast of Kamet; connected to Kamet by Meade's Col. First ascent 1950. * Mana Peak, 7,272m (23,858 ft) Ranked 92nd, prominence = 720 m, , south-southeast of Kamet. First ascent 1937. Several adjoining peaks, such as Mana NW, 7,092 m, Point 6,977 m, Deoban, 6,855 m, and Bidhan Parbat, 6,519 m, also lie close to Kamet.Joydeep Sircar, Himalayan handbook, Calcutta 1979 Nomenclature There are varying explanations of the name \\"Kamet.\\" C. F. Meade gives the pronunciation as , and claims that it is known to Tibetans as Kangmen, signifying \\"huge grandmother of a sacred snow chain\\". However, Frank Smythe writes in his book Kamet Conquered that the genesis of the name is from the Tibetan word Kangmed (\\"the lower snows\\", from kang, \\"snow\\", and med, \\"little\\"), as distinct from the \\"higher snows\\" of the Kailash range, 110 miles east of Kamet. (This range is slightly lower than Kamet, its highest peak being Gurla Mandhata, 7,728 m/25,355 ft; however it stands more fully on the high Tibetan Plateau). At dawn and dusk, \\"the copper colored rock of Mount Kamet reflecting the oblique rays of the sun on its hanging glaciers appears to set these glaciers aglow with crackling flames and bathes the mountain in a red burning glow\\". Hence the term \\"glacier fire\\" is also used as an allusion to the name Kamet. Partial timeline * 1848: Richard Strachey determines the height and location of Kamet, as well as the neighboring peaks Abi Gamin, Mukut Parbat, and Mana. * 1855: German explorers and scientists Adolphe and Robert Schlagintweit, invited by the East India Company to make surveys, travel into Tibet in disguise. After being discovered and arrested, they return, and attempt Abi Gamin from Tibet (via the Abi Gamin Glacier), believing it to be Kamet. (This mistake hampers expeditions until 1912.) They claim to reach a height of 6,785 m (22,260 ft), which is extraordinary for this date. * 1877: I. S. Pocock of the Survey of India, under E. C. Ryall, accurately surveys Kamet's position. However, he supports the inaccurate belief that Abi Gamin is a minor subpeak of Kamet and that a northern route to the summit is practical. * 1907: Dr. Tom Longstaff, Brig. Charles Bruce and A. L. Mumm, with alpine guides Alexis and Henri Brocherel, make a preliminary reconnaissance of the eastern and western sides of Kamet. The highest point reached is 6,100 m (20,000 ft) above the East Kamet Glacier. Longstaff deems the East Kamet route as too dangerous due to avalanche risk. * 1910‚Äì1911: C. F. Meade, with Alpine guides Alexis Brocherel and Pierre Blanc, and a separate expedition under Dr. A. M. Kellas, make a preliminary reconnaissance of the western side of the peak; they explore Khaiam Pass and Glacier. * 1911: Capt. A. M. Slingsby attempt Kamet on the western side from Ghastoli Glacier (or West Kamet Glacier) via the col on the ridge between Abi Gamin and Mukut Parbat (subsequently named as Slingsby's Col, 6,400 m/21,000 ft). * 1912: Meade, with Alpine guides Franz Lochmatter of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais, Pierre Blanc, Justin Blanc and Jean Perrin, attempts Kamet by Slingsby's route, and also later explores the Raikhana glacier system to the east of Kamet. Meade concludes that the East Kamet Glacier is the only practicable route to Mt Kamet's summit. * 1913: Slingsby attempts the same route as in 1911 and reaches 7,000 m (23,000 ft). (He later dies in battle in Mesopotamia in 1916.) * 1913: Meade, with Alpine guide Pierre Blanc, attempts Kamet from the eastern side and reaches Meade's Col, 7,138 m. (23,420 ft). * 1914: Kellas makes another reconnaissance of which no records are available, and which is probably abandoned midway due to the commencement of World War I. * 1920: Kellas and Col. H. T. Morshead attempt Meade's 1913 route and reach a point slightly above Meade's Col. * 1931: The first ascent of Kamet, detailed above. * 1937: Frank Smythe returns to the Bhyundar Valley and makes the solo first ascent of Mana on 12 August, through its south ridge from the plateau at the head of the Uttari Naktoni glacier. His companion P.R.Oliver stopped exhausted at 23000'.Frank Smythe,Valley of Flowers, Hodder & Stoughton 1938 * 1950: An Anglo-Swiss expedition ascends Abi Gamin from its North East ridge. * 1951: Mukut Parbat is climbed via the steep northwest ridge by a crack New Zealand team that included Earle Riddiford (leader), Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, Edmund Cotter and Pasang Dawa Lama.

The branches of the West Kamet Glacier head on the western slopes of Kamet, Abi Gamin, and Mukut Parbat. The East Kamet Glacier flows from the eastern side of Kamet and Mana. The Raikhana glacier originates on the east side of Meade's Col saddle, flows east of Abi Gamin, and unites with the East Kamet Glacier. The West Kamet Glacier drains into the Saraswati River while the East Kamet Glacier feeds the Dhauliganga River; both rivers are tributaries of the Alaknanda River, the major river of the Chamoli district. High altitude research A. M. Kellas and his companion H. T. Morshead conducted scientific studies during their 1920 Kamet expedition focusing on the physiology of high altitude travel and acclimatization, and on the possibility of using supplemental oxygen. These studies eventually proved useful on expeditions to Mount Everest.

Ricci-flat manifolds are special cases of Einstein manifolds, where the cosmological constant need not vanish. Since Ricci curvature measures the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball deviates from the volume of a ball in Euclidean space, small geodesic balls will have no volume deviation, but their \\"shape\\" may vary from the shape of the standard ball in Euclidean space. For example, in a Ricci-flat manifold, a circle in Euclidean space may be deformed into an ellipse with equal area. This is due to Weyl curvature. Ricci-flat manifolds often have restricted holonomy groups. Important cases include Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds and hyperk√§hler manifolds.

They are named after Albert Einstein because this condition is equivalent to saying that the metric is a solution of the vacuum Einstein field equations (with cosmological constant), although both the dimension and the signature of the metric can be arbitrary, thus not being restricted to the four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds usually studied in general relativity. Einstein manifolds in four Euclidean dimensions are studied as gravitational instantons. If M is the underlying n-dimensional manifold and g is its metric tensor the Einstein condition means that :\\\\mathrm{Ric} = kg for some constant k, where Ric denotes the Ricci tensor of g. Einstein manifolds with are called Ricci-flat manifolds. The Einstein condition and Einstein's equation In local coordinates the condition that be an Einstein manifold is simply :R_{ab} = kg_{ab} . Taking the trace of both sides reveals that the constant of proportionality k for Einstein manifolds is related to the scalar curvature R by :R = nk , where n is the dimension of M. In general relativity, Einstein's equation with a cosmological constant Œõ is :R_{ab} - \\\\frac{1}{2}g_{ab}R + g_{ab}\\\\Lambda = \\\\kappa T_{ab}, where is the Einstein gravitational constant. should not be confused with k.

Therefore, vacuum solutions of Einstein's equation are (Lorentzian) Einstein manifolds with k proportional to the cosmological constant.  Examples  Simple examples of Einstein manifolds include: *Any manifold with constant sectional curvature is an Einstein manifold--in particular: ** Euclidean space, which is flat, is a simple example of Ricci-flat, hence Einstein metric. ** The n-sphere, S^n, with the round metric is Einstein with k=n-1. ** Hyperbolic space with the canonical metric is Einstein with k = -(n - 1). * Complex projective space, \\\\mathbf{CP}^n, with the Fubini‚ÄìStudy metric, have k = n + 1. * Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds admit an Einstein metric that is also K√§hler, with Einstein constant k=0. Such metrics are not unique, but rather come in families; there is a Calabi‚ÄìYau metric in every K√§hler class, and the metric also depends on the choice of complex structure. For example, there is a 60-parameter family of such metrics on K3, 57 parameters of which give rise to Einstein metrics which are not related by isometries or rescalings. A necessary condition for closed, oriented, 4-manifolds to be Einstein is satisfying the Hitchin‚ÄìThorpe inequality. Applications Four dimensional Riemannian Einstein manifolds are also important in mathematical physics as gravitational instantons in quantum theories of gravity. The term \\"gravitational instanton\\" is usually used restricted to Einstein 4-manifolds whose Weyl tensor is self-dual, and it is usually assumed that the metric is asymptotic to the standard metric of Euclidean 4-space (and are therefore complete but non-compact). In differential geometry, self-dual Einstein 4-manifolds are also known as (4-dimensional) hyperk√§hler manifolds in the Ricci-flat case, and quaternion K√§hler manifolds otherwise. Higher-dimensional Lorentzian Einstein manifolds are used in modern theories of gravity, such as string theory, M-theory and supergravity. Hyperk√§hler and quaternion K√§hler manifolds (which are special kinds of Einstein manifolds) also have applications in physics as target spaces for nonlinear œÉ-models with supersymmetry. Compact Einstein manifolds have been much studied in differential geometry, and many examples are known, although constructing them is often challenging. Compact Ricci-flat manifolds are particularly difficult to find: in the monograph on the subject by the pseudonymous author Arthur Besse, readers are offered a meal in a starred restaurant in exchange for a new example.

An adaptation of the Quebecois film Louis 19, King of the Airwaves (Louis 19, le roi des ondes) (1994),\\"EDtv a fun, fluffy Truman Show\\". Montreal Gazette, March 26, 1999. it stars Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Ellen DeGeneres, Martin Landau, Rob Reiner, Sally Kirkland, Elizabeth Hurley, Clint Howard, and Dennis Hopper. The movie received mixed reviews and was a box office flop, grossing only a little over $35 million compared to its $80 million production budget. The film was screened out of competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Television channel True TV is commencing interviews for a TV show that shows a normal person's life 24/7. This idea was thought up by a TV producer Cynthia (Ellen DeGeneres). They interview Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) and his brother, Ray (Woody Harrelson). When the producers see the interview Cynthia decides to use Ed and interviews only Ed. The show hits the airwaves under the title \\"Ed TV.\\" It is a total failure at first, as only boring things happen and the producers want to pull the plug, except for Cynthia. Ed TV gets interesting suddenly on Day 3 when Ed visits Ray. Ed (along with the cameramen) discovers that Ray is cheating on his girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman). Ed then visits Shari to apologize to her for Ray's actions. Shari is very drunk and starts insulting Ray, by talking to the camera. She makes everyone laugh and gasp by saying \\"Ray was a bad lay.\\" Ed tries to comfort Shari, and he reveals he has feelings for her. She then reveals she has feelings for Ed as well. They slowly move their faces closer and finally kiss each other. Ed then locks out the camera crew and proceeds to passionately kiss Shari for a while. Ed TV thus becomes extremely popular. At Cynthia's insistence Ed starts a relationship with Shari which is short lived, as Ed grows more interested in staying on TV and Shari is abused by viewers who find her unappealing. Ed then goes on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and meets beautiful model/actress Jill (Elizabeth Hurley) who takes a liking to Ed. Ed then visits Shari and she tells Ed that she does not want to be with him until \\"Ed TV\\" stops airing. She then leaves town. Ed goes to the park with Ray and some friends to play football when Jill comes to talk to him, because Cynthia brought her in to earn more ratings. She invites Ed to dinner at her house. When he arrives at Jill's house, there is a massive crowd. They have a small talk, and then they kiss on top of a table. They are about to have sex, but then Ed falls off the table and squishes Jill's cat. Ed never sees Jill again. Ed's father Hank (Dennis Hopper), who abandoned his family when Ed was 13, unexpectedly visits Ed and informs him that he left because Ed's mother was having an affair with Ed's current stepfather, Al (Martin Landau). Ed is furious with his mother Jeanette, who had previously claimed that she'd only met Al after Hank left, and argues with her. Next, Ed gets a phone call telling him to come to the hospital. The doctor says that his father is dead and that he died making love to his wife. Ed assumes this means Al, but it‚Äôs actually Hank, who was having an affair with Jeanette. After the funeral, Ed becomes disheartened by the fact that the producers want him to stay on longer and that he cannot do anything to change their minds or he would be in breach of his contract. Ed is depressed until he catches a glimpse of Shari (in disguise wearing a wig and sunglasses). He chases her for a long time until she stops in the women's bathroom in a movie theater. She says she is staying with her brother as it is his birthday and she just wanted to see Ed. Ed vows to find a way to end the show to be with Shari. When Ed exits, one cameraman stays with Shari saying that it is the producers' new idea. The main cameraman tells him that all his family are being filmed, but they show the most interesting person, thus eliminating his family's right to privacy forever. Ed gets an idea on how to stop the main producer from showing the show: he says that he will give $10,000 to the person who can give him the best amount of \\"dirt\\" on the producers and that he will announce it live, with the desired result being they stop airing the show before he can make the announcement. As Cynthia feels sorry for Ed, she tells him a secret of the main producer. Ed announces the secret (that the man has to pump a liquid into his penis to get an erection) but before he can announce who it is they stop airing the show. After the camera crew finally leaves Ed's apartment, he and Shari renew their relationship and celebrate the fact that TV news panelists predict Ed will be forgotten in a short period of time.

Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64%, based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site's consensus states: \\"If it's not as ambitious as The Truman Show in satirizing the voyeuristic nature of television, EdTV is an amiable, witty comedy with fine performances from Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.\\" On Metacritic the film has a rating of 48 out of 100, based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Ross Anthony of Hollywood Report Card questioned the plausibility of parts of the script but wrote: \\"Though the thunder of its big idea may have been lost to The Truman Show [...], this screenplay still has real and punchy dialogue. Despite its faults EDTV will engage from beginning till end.\\" Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film 2 and a 1/2 out of 4 stars. Ebert says that although they share the same idea, The Truman Show is a parable, and EDtv is an ambitious sitcom. Ebert wonders what type of person would sign up for a show like this, and doesn't believe Ed is that kind of person so \\"the film never quite feels convincing.\\" See also * List of films featuring surveillance References External links  Category:1999 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1999 comedy films Category:American comedy films Category:Fictional television shows Category:Films about television Category:Films produced by Brian Grazer Category:Films directed by Ron Howard Category:Films set in San Francisco Category:Films set in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Films shot in San Francisco Category:Imagine Entertainment films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:American remakes of Canadian films Category:Films with screenplays by Lowell Ganz Category:Films with screenplays by Babaloo Mandel Category:Films scored by Randy Edelman ","title":"EDtv"},{"id":"644848","text":"Cumrun Vafa ( ; born 1 August 1960) is an Iranian-American theoretical physicist and the Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard University. Early life and education Cumrun Vafa was born in Tehran, Iran on 1 August 1960. He became interested in physics as a young child, specifically how the moon was not falling from the sky, and he later grew his interests in math by high school and was fascinated by how mathematics could predict the movement of objects. He graduated from Alborz High School in Tehran and moved to the United States in 1977 for study at university. He received a B.S. in mathematics and physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1981. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 1985 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \\"Symmetries, inequalities and index theorems\\", under the supervision of Edward Witten.  Academia  After his PhD degree, Vafa became a junior fellow via the Harvard Society of Fellows at Harvard University, where he later got a junior faculty position. In 1989 he was offered a senior faculty position, and he has been there ever since. Vafa worked at Princeton University within the Institute for Advanced Study, within the School of Natural Sciences and the School of Mathematics in 1994. Research Vafa's research in string theory is focused on the nature of quantum gravity and the relation between geometry and quantum field theories. He is known in the string theory community for his co-discovery with Strominger that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole can be accounted for by solitonic states of superstring theory, and for expounding the relation between geometry and field theories that arise through string dualities (culminating in the Gopakumar‚ÄìVafa conjecture). This topic has been known as \\"geometric engineering of quantum field theories\\". In 1997, he developed F-theory, a 12-dimensional theory that compactifies to 10-D Type IIB superstring theory. He is also interested in understanding the underlying meaning of string dualities, as well as trying to apply superstring theory to some unsolved questions of elementary particle physics such as the hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem. He has made contributions to topological string theories and to the understanding of mirror symmetry. He is a trustee of Network of Iranians for Knowledge and Innovation (NIKI).  Awards and honors  In 2017, Vafa, alongside Andrew Strominger and Joseph Polchinski, jointly won the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their advancement of string theory and jointly won the 2014 Breakthrough Prize in Physics Frontiers Prize. He is the recipient of the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)'s, 2008 Dirac Medal, which was won alongside Juan Maldacena, and Joseph Polchinski for their advancement of string theory. In 1998 he was a Plenary Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians. In 2016, Vafa was awarded the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics. Vafa was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005 and as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2009.  Publications   Research articles  Vafa has co-authored and published more than 300 research articles in the fields of string theory, mathematics, and physics, with many other researchers including: Robbert Dijkgraaf, Hirosi Ooguri, Mina Aganagic, Sergei Gukov, Rajesh Gopakumar, Lotte Hollands, and many others.

His home was on the banks of the Severn River, in view of the Chesapeake Bay.Pinkney, 1853, p. 11 Pinkney attended King William school. His teacher was a Mr. Brefhard. At age thirteen he left school but his teacher, aware of the young Pinkney's intelligence, gave him private lessons at home.Pinkney, 1853, p. 14 He studied medicine (which he did not practice) and law, becoming a lawyer upon admission to the bar in 1786. After practicing law in Harford County, Maryland, he participated in Maryland's state constitutional convention. Pinkney was an excellent orator who possessing a command of language, and was said to possess a pleasing and articulate manner in his speaking.Pinkney, 1853, p. 81 His son, Edward Coote Pinkney, became an accomplished poet. Political career In April 1788, Pinkney was elected a delegate to the convention of the State of Maryland, which ratified the United States Constitution, marking the beginning of his political career.Pinkney, 1853, p. 17 Pinkney served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1788 to 1792 and then again in 1795, and served as a U.S. Congressman from the third district of Maryland in 1791 and from the fifth district from 1815 until 1816. He was mayor of Annapolis from 1795 to 1800. In 1801 he was appointed Attorney general for the District of Pennsylvania, by President Thomas JeffersonWheaton, 1826, p.128 and Attorney General of Maryland from 1805 to 1806. Pinkney and James Monroe served together as co-US Ministers to the Court of St. James in Great Britain) 1806 to 1807. President Jefferson asked them to negotiate an end to harassment of American shipping, but Britain showed no signs of improving relations. They negotiated the Monroe‚ÄìPinkney Treaty, but it lacked provisions to end impressment and was subsequently rejected by President Jefferson, never going into effect.Hayes, 2008, pp. 504‚Äì05 Pinkney was Minister Plenipotentiary from 1808 until 1811. He then returned to Maryland, serving in the Maryland State Senate in 1811. In 1811 he joined President James Madison's cabinet as Attorney General. He was a major in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812 and was wounded at the Battle of Bladensburg, Maryland in August 1814. After the War, he served as congressman from the fifth district of Maryland from 1815 to 1816. After serving in Congress he became the U.S. Minister Plenipotentiary to Russia from 1816 until 1818, along with a special mission to the Kingdom of Naples. Pinkney successfully argued many important cases before the Supreme Court, including the landmark case of McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), where the right of the US Congress to charter the Bank of the United States was upheld.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, William Pinkney Pinkney served as a US senator from Maryland from 1819 until his death in 1822.

There are two kinds of heterotic string, the heterotic SO(32) and the heterotic E8 √ó E8, abbreviated to HO and HE. Heterotic string theory was first developed in 1985 by David Gross, Jeffrey Harvey, Emil Martinec, and Ryan Rohm (the so-called \\"Princeton String Quartet\\"), in one of the key papers that fueled the first superstring revolution. Overview In string theory, the left-moving and the right-moving excitations are completely decoupled, and it is possible to construct a string theory whose left-moving (counter-clockwise) excitations are treated as a bosonic string propagating in D = 26 dimensions, while the right-moving (clockwise) excitations are treated as a superstring in D = 10 dimensions. The mismatched 16 dimensions must be compactified on an even, self-dual lattice (a discrete subgroup of a linear space). There are two possible even self-dual lattices in 16 dimensions, and it leads to two types of the heterotic string. They differ by the gauge group in 10 dimensions. One gauge group is SO(32) (the HO string) while the other is E8 √ó E8 (the HE string).Joseph Polchinski (1998). String Theory: Volume 2, p. 45. These two gauge groups also turned out to be the only two anomaly-free gauge groups that can be coupled to the N = 1 supergravity in 10 dimensions. (Although not realized for quite some time, U(1)496 and E8 √ó U(1)248 are anomalous.) Every heterotic string must be a closed string, not an open string; it is not possible to define any boundary conditions that would relate the left-moving and the right-moving excitations because they have a different character. String duality String duality is a class of symmetries in physics that link different string theories. In the 1990s, it was realized that the strong coupling limit of the HO theory is type I string theory -- a theory that also contains open strings; this relation is called S-duality. The HO and HE theories are also related by T-duality. Because the various superstring theories were shown to be related by dualities, it was proposed that each type of string was a different limit of a single underlying theory called M-theory.

It corresponds to the English name Ishmael. Etymology and meaning The literal translation of the name Ismail is \\"heard by God\\" and according to Abrahamic tradition, it refers to the yearning of Ibrahim and his wife, Sarah, to have a child. Ismail's mother, however, was not Sarah, but Hagar, Sarah's maidservant, who Sarah gave to Ibrahim as a concubine because she was unable to have a child. Sarah later does give birth to a son, Isaac.

The aims of an artist collective can include almost anything that is relevant to the needs of the artist; this can range from purchasing bulk materials, sharing equipment, space or materials, to following shared ideologies, aesthetic and political views or even living and working together as an extended family. Sharing of ownership, risk, benefits, and status is implied, as opposed to other, more common business structures with an explicit hierarchy of ownership such as an association or a company. Overview Artist collectives have occurred throughout history, often gathered around central resources, for instance the ancient sculpture workshops at the marble quarries on Milos in Greece and Carrara in Italy. Collectives featured during both the Russian Revolution when they were set up by the state in all major communities, and the French Revolution when the Louvre in Paris was occupied as an artist collective. More traditional artist collectives tend to be smallish groups of two to eight artists who produce work, either collaboratively or as individuals toward exhibiting together in gallery shows or public spaces. Often an artist collective will maintain a collective space, for exhibiting or as workshop or studio facilities. Some newer, more experimental kinds of groups include intentional networks, anonymous, connector, hidden or nested groups, and groups with unconventional time- scales. Artist collectives may be formed: For economic reasons, to give members volume purchasing power and allow costs of publicity and shows to be shared. For political reasons, to increase local lobbying power for arts infrastructure, to gather behind a cause or belief. For professional reasons, to develop a higher group profile that benefits the individuals by association, to create a hub for curators and commissioners to more easily locate potential talent.

These include devices providing services for network firewalls, unified threat management (UTM), virtual private networks (VPNs), and anti-spam for email. The company also markets information subscription services related to their products. The company solutions also serve to solve problems surrounding compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). On March 13, 2012, USA Today said that Dell had announced its intent to acquire SonicWall, which then had 130 patents and 950 employees. Dell's acquisition of SonicWall became official on May 9, 2012.USA Today, page B1, published March 14, 2008, \\"Dell buys security specialist SonicWall\\" On June 20, 2016, Dell sold SonicWall (part of its Dell Software) to private equity firm Francisco Partners and Elliott Management. History In 1991, Brothers Sreekanth Ravi and Sudhakar Ravi founded the company under the name Sonic Systems to develop Ethernet and Fast Ethernet cards, hubs and bridges for the Apple market. In the late 1990s, the company released a security product initially called Interpol and later branded SonicWALL, a dedicated hardware appliance with firewall and VPN software intended for the small-business market. As sales for the security appliances rapidly accelerated, the company exited the Apple add-on networking business and refocused exclusively as a network security company. In late 1999, the company changed its name from Sonic Systems to SonicWALL, Inc. to represent the shift to a network security company, and in November 1999 SonicWall went public with the symbol SNWL. In 2001, SonicWall upgraded its Global Management System (GMS) software to manage more VPN devices. Matthew T. Medeiros (formerly of Philips Components) became CEO in March 2003. SonicWall acquired a number of companies through the years, expanding its product line in the process. In 2005, SonicWall announced the acquisition of enKoo. In 2007, SonicWall announced the acquisition of Aventail Corporation. On July 23, 2010, SonicWall announced that it had completed its merger with affiliates of an investor group led by Thoma Bravo, LLC, which included the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan through its private investor department, Teachers' Private Capital. After the merger SonicWall was delisted from NASDAQ. On March 13, 2012, Dell announced that they had signed a definitive agreement to acquire SonicWall. On May 20, 2016, Dell announced the sale of Dell Software, which included SonicWall, to private equity firm Francisco Partners and Elliott Management.

CDs differ from savings accounts in that the CD has a specific, fixed term (often one, three, or six months, or one to five years) and usually, a fixed interest rate. The bank expects CD to be held until maturity, at which time they can be withdrawn and interest paid. Like savings accounts, CDs are insured \\"money in the bank\\" (in the US up to $250,000) and thus, up to the local insured deposit limit, virtually risk free. In the US, CDs are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for banks and by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) for credit unions. In exchange for the customer depositing the money for an agreed term, institutions usually offer higher interest rates than they do on accounts that customers can withdraw from on demand‚Äîthough this may not be the case in an inverted yield curve situation. Fixed rates are common, but some institutions offer CDs with various forms of variable rates. For example, in mid-2004, interest rates were expected to rise‚Äîand many banks and credit unions began to offer CDs with a \\"bump-up\\" feature. These allow for a single readjustment of the interest rate, at a time of the consumer's choosing, during the term of the CD. Sometimes, financial institutions introduce CDs indexed to the stock market, bond market, or other indices. Some features of CDs are: * A larger principal should/may receive a higher interest rate. * A longer term usually earns a higher interest rate, except in the case of an inverted yield curve (e.g., preceding a recession). * Smaller institutions tend to offer higher interest rates than larger ones. * Personal CD accounts generally receive higher interest rates than business CD accounts. * Banks and credit unions that are not insured by the FDIC or NCUA generally offer higher interest rates. CDs typically require a minimum deposit, and may offer higher rates for larger deposits. The best rates are generally offered on \\"Jumbo CDs\\" with minimum deposits of $100,000. Jumbo CDs are commonly bought by large institutional investors, such as banks and pension funds, that are interested in low-risk and stable investment options. Jumbo CDs are also known as negotiable certificates of deposits and come in bearer form. These work like conventional certificate of deposits that lock in the principal amount for a set timeframe and are payable upon maturity. The consumer who opens a CD may receive a paper certificate, but it is now common for a CD to consist simply of a book entry and an item shown in the consumer's periodic bank statements. That is, there is often no \\"certificate\\" as such. Consumers who want a hard copy that verifies their CD purchase may request a paper statement from the bank, or print out their own from the financial institution's online banking service.  Closing a CD  Withdrawals before maturity are usually subject to a substantial penalty. For a five-year CD, this is often the loss of up to twelve months' interest. These penalties ensure that it is generally not in a holder's best interest to withdraw the money before maturity‚Äîunless the holder has another investment with significantly higher return or has a serious need for the money. Commonly, institutions mail a notice to the CD holder shortly before the CD matures requesting directions. The notice usually offers the choice of withdrawing the principal and accumulated interest or \\"rolling it over\\" (depositing it into a new CD). Generally, a \\"window\\" is allowed after maturity where the CD holder can cash in the CD without penalty. In the absence of such directions, it is common for the institution to roll over the CD automatically, once again tying up the money for a period of time (though the CD holder may be able to specify at the time the CD is opened not to roll over the CD).  CD refinance  The Truth in Savings Regulation DD requires that insured CDs state, at time of account opening, the penalty for early withdrawal. It is generally accepted that these penalties cannot be revised by the depository prior to maturity. However, there have been cases in which a credit union modified its early withdrawal penalty and made it retroactive on existing accounts. The second occurrence happened when Main Street Bank of Texas closed a group of CDs early without full payment of interest. The bank claimed the disclosures allowed them to do so. The penalty for early withdrawal deters depositors from taking advantage of subsequent better investment opportunities during the term of the CD. In rising interest rate environments, the penalty may be insufficient to discourage depositors from redeeming their deposit and reinvesting the proceeds after paying the applicable early withdrawal penalty. Added interest from the new higher yielding CD may more than offset the cost of the early withdrawal penalty.  Ladders  While longer investment terms yield higher interest rates, longer terms also may result in a loss of opportunity to lock in higher interest rates in a rising-rate economy. A common mitigation strategy for this opportunity cost is the \\"CD ladder\\" strategy. In the ladder strategies, the investor distributes the deposits over a period of several years with the goal of having all one's money deposited at the longest term (and therefore the higher rate) but in a way that part of it matures annually. In this way, the depositor reaps the benefits of the longest-term rates while retaining the option to re-invest or withdraw the money in shorter-term intervals. For example, an investor beginning a three-year ladder strategy starts by depositing equal amounts of money each into a 3-year CD, 2-year CD, and 1-year CD. From that point on, a CD reaches maturity every year, at which time the investor can re-invest at a 3-year term. After two years of this cycle, the investor has all money deposited at a three-year rate, yet have one-third of the deposits mature every year (which the investor can then reinvest, augment, or withdraw). The responsibility for maintaining the ladder falls on the depositor, not the financial institution. Because the ladder does not depend on the financial institution, depositors are free to distribute a ladder strategy across more than one bank. This can be advantageous, as smaller banks may not offer the longer terms of some larger banks. Although laddering is most common with CDs, investors may use this strategy on any time deposit account with similar terms.  Step-up callable CD  Step-Up Callable CDs are a form of CD where the interest rate increases multiple times prior to maturity of the CD. These CDs are often issued with maturities up to 15 years, with a step-up in interest happening at year 5 and year 10. Typically, the beginning interest rate is higher than what is available on shorter-maturity CDs, and the rate increases with each step-up period. These CD‚Äôs have a ‚Äúcall‚Äù feature which allows the issuer to return the deposit to the investor after a specified period of time, which is usually at least a year. When the CD is called, the investor is given back their deposit and they will no longer receive any future interest payments. Because of the call feature, interest rate risk is borne by the investor, rather than the issuer. This transfer of risk allows Step-Up Callable CDs to offer a higher interest rate than currently available from non-callable CDs. If prevailing interest rates decline, the issuer will call the CD and re-issue debt at a lower interest rate. If the CD is called before maturity, the investor is faced with reinvestment risk. If prevailing interest rates increase, the issuer will allow the CD to go to maturity.  Deposit insurance  The amount of insurance coverage varies, depending on how accounts for an individual or family are structured at the institution. The level of insurance is governed by complex FDIC and NCUA rules, available in FDIC and NCUA booklets or online. The standard insurance coverage is currently $250,000 per owner or depositor for single accounts or $250,000 per co-owner for joint accounts. Some institutions use a private insurance company instead of, or in addition to, the federally backed FDIC or NCUA deposit insurance. Institutions often stop using private supplemental insurance when they find that few customers have a high enough balance level to justify the additional cost. The Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service program lets investors keep up to $50 million invested in CDs managed through one bank with full FDIC insurance. However rates will likely not be the highest available.  Terms and conditions  There are many variations in the terms and conditions for CDs. The federally required \\"Truth in Savings\\" booklet, or other disclosure document that gives the terms of the CD, must be made available before the purchase. Employees of the institution are generally not familiar with this information; only the written document carries legal weight. If the original issuing institution has merged with another institution, or if the CD is closed early by the purchaser, or there is some other issue, the purchaser will need to refer to the terms and conditions document to ensure that the withdrawal is processed following the original terms of the contract. *The terms and conditions may be changeable. They may contain language such as \\"We can add to, delete or make any other changes (\\"Changes\\") we want to these Terms at any time.\\" *The CD may be callable. The terms may state that the bank or credit union can close the CD before the term ends. *Payment of interest. Interest may be paid out as it is accrued or it may accumulate in the CD. *Interest calculation. The CD may start earning interest from the date of deposit or from the start of the next month or quarter. *Right to delay withdrawals. Institutions generally have the right to delay withdrawals for a specified period to stop a bank run. *Withdrawal of principal. May be at the discretion of the financial institution. Withdrawal of principal below a certain minimum‚Äîor any withdrawal of principal at all‚Äîmay require closure of the entire CD. A US Individual Retirement Account CD may allow withdrawal of IRA Required Minimum Distributions without a withdrawal penalty. *Withdrawal of interest. May be limited to the most recent interest payment or allow for withdrawal of accumulated total interest since the CD was opened. Interest may be calculated to date of withdrawal or through the end of the last month or last quarter. *Penalty for early withdrawal. May be measured in months of interest, may be calculated to be equal to the institution's current cost of replacing the money, or may use another formula. May or may not reduce the principal‚Äîfor example, if principal is withdrawn three months after opening a CD with a six- month penalty. *Fees. A fee may be specified for withdrawal or closure or for providing a certified check. *Automatic renewal. The institution may or may not commit to sending a notice before automatic rollover at CD maturity. The institution may specify a grace period before automatically rolling over the CD to a new CD at maturity. Some banks have been known to renew at rates lower than that of the original CD.  Criticism  There may be some correlation between CD interest rates and inflation. For example, in one situation interest rates might be 15% and inflation 15%, and in another situation interest rates might be 2% and inflation may be 2%. Of course, these factors cancel out, so the real interest rate, which indicates the maintenance or otherwise of value, is the same in these two examples. However the real rates of return offered by CDs, as with other fixed interest instruments, can vary a lot. For example, during a credit crunch banks are in dire need of funds, and CD interest rate increases may not track inflation. The above does not include taxes.Ric Edelman, The Truth About Money, 3rd ed., p. 30 When taxes are considered, the higher-rate situation above is worse, with a lower (more negative) real return, although the before-tax real rates of return are identical. The after-inflation, after-tax return is what is important. Author Ric Edelman writes: \\"You don't make any money in bank accounts (in real economic terms), simply because you're not supposed to.\\"Ric Edelman, The Truth About Money, 3rd ed., p. 61 On the other hand, he says, bank accounts and CDs are fine for holding cash for a short amount of time. Even to the extent that CD rates are correlated with inflation, this can only be the expected inflation at the time the CD is bought. The actual inflation will be lower or higher. Locking in the interest rate for a long term may be bad (if inflation goes up) or good (if inflation goes down). For example, in the 1970s, inflation increased higher than it had been, and this was not fully reflected in interest rates. This is particularly important for longer-term notes, where the interest rate is locked in for some time. This gave rise to amusing nicknames for CDs. A little later, the opposite happened, and inflation declined. In general, and in common with other fixed interest investments, the economic value of a CD rises when market interest rates fall, and vice versa. Some banks pay lower than average rates, while others pay higher rates.Compare a typical large-bank 1-year CD, e.g., vs the highest 1-year CD available at a listing service, e.g., In the United States, depositors can take advantage of the best FDIC-insured rates without increasing their risk. As with other types of investment, investors should be suspicious of a CD offering an unusually high rate of return. For example Allen Stanford used fraudulent CDs with high rates to lure people into his Ponzi scheme.

The ExpressCard technical standard specifies the design of slots built into the computer and of expansion cards to insert in the slots. The cards contain electronic circuits and sometimes connectors for external devices. The ExpressCard standard replaces the PC Card (also known as PCMCIA) standards. ExpressCards can connect a variety of devices to a computer including mobile broadband modems (sometimes called connect cards), IEEE 1394 (FireWire) connectors, USB connectors, Ethernet network ports, Serial ATA storage devices, solid-state drives, external enclosures for desktop-size PCI Express graphics cards and other peripheral devices, wireless network interface controllers (NIC), TV tuner cards, Common Access Card (CAC) readers, and sound cards. Standards Originally developed by the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA), the ExpressCard standard is maintained by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). The host device supports PCI Express, USB 2.0 (including Hi-Speed), and USB 3.0 (SuperSpeed) (ExpressCard 2.0 only) connectivity through the ExpressCard slot; cards can be designed to use any of these modes. The cards are hot-pluggable. The ExpressCard standard is an open standard by ITU-T definition, and can be obtained from the USB-IF website free of charge. USB-IF administers the ExpressCard Compliance Program, under which companies earn the right to obtain a license to use the ExpressCard logo on their compliant products. Form factors ExpressCards compared to the predecessor PC Card The ExpressCard standard specifies two form factors, ExpressCard/34 ( wide) and ExpressCard/54 ( wide, in an L-shape)‚Äîthe connector is the same on both (34 mm wide). Standard cards are long ( shorter than CardBus) and thick, but may be thicker on sections that extend outside the standard form for antennas, sockets, etc. With its 75 mm standard length, the ExpressCard will protrude 5 mm over the holder's surface (e.g. laptop surface), whereas a variant with 70 mm length remains level with the surface. Comparison to other standards Cardbus to ExpressCard Adapter The older PC Cards came in 16-bit and the later 32-bit CardBus designs. The major benefit of the ExpressCard over the PC card is more bandwidth, due to the ExpressCard's direct connection to the system bus over a PCI Express √ó1 lane and USB 2.0, while CardBus cards only interface with PCI. The ExpressCard has a maximum throughput of 2.5 Gbit/s through PCI Express and 480 Mbit/s through USB 2.0 dedicated for each slot, while all CardBus and PCI devices connected to a computer usually share a total 1.06 Gbit/s bandwidth. The ExpressCard standard specifies voltages of either 1.5 V or 3.3 V; CardBus slots can use 3.3 V or 5.0 V. The ExpressCard FAQ claims lower cost, better scalability, and better integration with motherboard chipset technology than Cardbus. PCMCIA devices can be connected to an ExpressCard slot via an adapter. When the PC Card was introduced, the only other way to connect peripherals to a laptop computer was via RS-232 and parallel ports of limited performance, so it was widely adopted for many peripherals. More recently, virtually all laptop equipment has 480 Mbit/s Hi-Speed USB 2.0 ports, and most types of peripheral which formerly used a PC Card connection are available for USB or are built- in, making the ExpressCard less necessary than the PC Card was in its day. Some laptop computers do not have an ExpressCard slot. Availability A mobile broadband modem integrated into ExpressCard 34 An ExpressCard slot was commonly included on high-end laptops from the mid 2000s to the early 2010s: * Hewlett-Packard began shipping systems with ExpressCard in November 2004. * IBM integrated the slot into their flagship ThinkPad T43 in May 2005. * Dell Computer also incorporates this in their Precision (the 17 in models have them exclusively, the 15 in Precisions have both express card and PCMCIA Card slots), Inspiron, Latitude (Latitude D-series have PCMCIA card slots. The D820/D830 have both ExpressCard and PCMCIA card slots. Latitude E-Series 6000 have ExpressCard54 slots), Studio, Vostro and XPS Laptop product lines. * Fujitsu-Siemens began shipping systemshttp://www.fujitsu- siemens.com/home/products/notebooks/amilo_m_3438_4438.html with ExpressCard in mid-2005. * Apple Inc. included single ExpressCard/34 slots in every MacBook Pro notebook computer from January 2006 through June 2009. At the June 8, 2009 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference the company announced that the 15-inch and 13-inch MacBook Pro models would replace the ExpressCard slot with a Secure Digital card slot, while retaining the ExpressCard slot on the 17-inch model. In June 2012 Apple discontinued the 17-inch model and no further Macbooks have offered an ExpressCard slot. * ASUS has also replaced the PC Card slot with an ExpressCard slot on many of its new models. * Sony also began shipping systems with ExpressCard with its new laptop VGN-C, VGN-SZ, VGN-NS, VPC and FW product line. * The Acer Aspire laptop series also has a single ExpressCard/54 slot on most new models. * Panasonic incorporates ExpressCard/54 slots in all the fully rugged and semi-rugged models of their Toughbook brand of laptop computers. * Gateway notebooks (ML3109 and later) also ship with ExpressCard/54 interfaces. * Eurocom notebooks Panther 3.0, Panther 2.0 currently ship with ExpressCard/34 while the Leopard 2.0 ships with ExpressCard/34/54. Older models such as the Panther, Leopard, Xcaliber, Montebello also supported ExpressCard interfaces. * Overam integrates an ExpressCard slot in its Mirage 7283 and 9570 laptops. Because of the lack of backward compatibility, some laptop manufacturers initially released models incorporating both CardBus (PCMCIA, PC Card) and ExpressCard slots. These included certain models of Acer Aspire, Acer Extensa, Toshiba Satellite, Dell Latitude and Precision, MSI S42x and Lenovo ThinkPad Z60m, R52, T60, R61 and T61. In March 2005, the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) showed some of the first ExpressCard products at the CeBIT trade show in Germany. A large number of ExpressCard devices were presented. In November 2006, Belkin announced that it was launching the first ExpressCard docking station, which uses the PCIe part of an ExpressCard connection to enable 1600x1200 video and the USB part to provide USB, audio and network ports. This points to the ability for ExpressCard to allow more capable non-OEM docking stations for laptop computers. In 2007, Sony introduced its Vaio TZ model, which incorporates ExpressCards. Also the Sony Vaio FZ and Vaio Z series have the ExpressCard/34 Slot integrated in them. Sony also uses the ExpressCard/34 form factor for the flash memory modules in its XDCAM EX/SxS based camcorders, making the copying of video data between these cameras and ExpressCard-equipped laptops easier. For this reason, Sony also offers a USB-based SxS reader for desktop computers. The new Toshiba Satellite P and X 200/205 series of laptops and desktop replacements have an ExpressCard/34 slot since April 2007. In P200 series it's a /54 size not /34.http://www.toshiba.co.uk/innovation/download_manuals.jsp?service=UK Ever since PCMCIA disbanded in 2009, newer laptops from 2010 on more commonly do not include ExpressCard slots except for some business-oriented models (e.g. some Lenovo models use it for supporting a smart card reader). For WWAN connectivity cards, either mini-PCIe slots or USB connected variants have become the preferred connection methods. For external desktop graphics card enclosures and other peripherals that interface with PCI Express, Thunderbolt has supplanted ExpressCard in that role due to its faster speed and ability to use multiple PCIe 2.0 lanes; the first and second Thunderbolt revisions offered 20Gbit/s of maximum bandwidth with four PCIe 2.0 lanes while ExpressCard could only muster 5Gbit/s maximum with one PCIe 2.0 lane. ExpressCard 2.0 The ExpressCard 2.0 standard was introduced on March 4, 2009, at CeBIT in Hannover. It provides a single PCIe 1.0 2.5 GT/s lane (optionally PCIe 2.0 with 5 GT/s) and a USB 3.0 \\"SuperSpeed\\" link with a raw transfer speed of 5 Gbit/s (effective transfer speed up to 400 MB/s).ExpressCard 2.0 FAQ (pdf) at ExpressCard.org, accessed 2009-12-04.

The stream is a popular destination for canoeing and recreational trout fishing.  Etymology  The creek derives its name from the eighteenth-century village of Layalhanning, an important Delaware Indian crossroads settlement located at the site where Fort Ligonier was built, in present Ligonier, Pennsylvania. The village was settled shortly after the Delaware left the Susquehanna River area in 1727. Layalhanning means \\"the middle stream\\" in the Delaware language-- \\"lawel\\" or \\"lawell\\" (middle); \\"hanna\\" (a river or stream); \\"ing\\" (at the place of). Variant names According to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as: * Leyelhanna Creek * Loyal Hanna Creek  Course  Loyalhanna rises from Laurel Ridge in southeastern Westmoreland County, north of Donegal and flows NNE, along the southeastern side of Chestnut Ridge. Approximately 5 mi (8 km) northwest of Ligonier it turns northwest, cutting through Chestnut Ridge and passing through Latrobe. From Latrobe, it flows NNW, passing through Loyalhanna Lake reservoir and joins with the Conemaugh River to form the Kiskiminetas River at Saltsburg. The creek lies about midway between the Juniata River to the east and the Ohio River to the west, and about halfway between the Conemaugh River to the north and the Youghiogheny River to the south.  Watershed  Decades before the 2000s, the lower end of the creek, beginning above Latrobe, was colored red due to acid from local mines. Rocks in the area are still stained red from the effects. In subsequent years, with the growth of environmental sensitivity, a remediation pond was installed near St. Vincent College that removes 90 percent of the iron oxide from the water.  Claims of Bigfoot sightings  Sam Sherry, of Wilpen, claimed to have encountered a Bigfoot while night fishing along Loyalhanna Creek on May 17, 1987. Sherry gained notice from Bigfoot enthusiasts and spent much of his life investigating the phenomenon in the area.

It comprised the eastern parts of the historic Lower Silesia region and the former County of Kladsko, both conquered by Prussia in 1742. 1905 map of the Middle Silesia region, Regierungsbezirk Breslau outlined History Silesia had been part of Bohemian crown lands of the Habsburg Monarchy until most of it was ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Silesian War, codified by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau. In 1813, the administrative Regierungsbezirk was established in Prussian Silesia, with its capital in Breslau (present-day Wroc≈Çaw). The western half of Lower Silesia was incorporated into Regierungsbezirk Liegnitz (Legnica), the adjacent Upper Silesian land in the east into Regierungsbezirk Oppeln (Opole). After the short-lived Regierungsbezirk Reichenbach (Dzier≈ºoni√≥w) was dissolved in 1820, the Middle Silesian district also comprised Glatzer Land (K≈Çodzko Land) in the south and several districts of the former duchies of M√ºnsterberg (Ziƒôbice), Jauer (Jawor) and Brieg (Brzeg). It then stretched from the Greater Polish plain in the north (Grand Duchy of Posen) to the border with Bohemia along the Sudetes mountain range in the south, where Glatzer Land also bordered on Austrian Silesia in the east. After World War I, the state of Czechoslovakia arose on the southern border, while Greater Poland in the north became part of the Second Polish Republic. At the same time, the Prussian Silesia Province was divided, whereby Regierungsbezirk Breslau formed the eastern half of the Province of Lower Silesia. After World War II, the region became part of Poland, as the Soviet Union expanded its borders and moved Poland westward under the terms of the 1945 Potsdam Agreement. By 1949, almost the entire indigenous German population was expelled. Today, the region is the eastern part of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship. Ethnolinguistic structure In 1819, Regierungsbezirk Breslau had 838,253 inhabitants: 755,553 Germans (90%); 66,500 Poles (8%); 8,900 Czechs (1%) and 7,300 Jews (1%). United States Immigration Commission in 1911 classified Polish-speaking Silesians as ethnic Poles. According to the Prussian census of 1890, Regierungsbezirk Breslau had a population of 1,599,322, of which 1,529,490 (95.63%) spoke German, 49,267 (3.08%) spoke Polish, 9,377 (0.59%) spoke Czech and 10,278 (0.64%) identified as bilingual (speaking German and another language).

It is subtitled The Cartoon Roleplaying Game. Toon was designed by Greg Costikyan and developed by Warren Spector, and first published in 1984 by Steve Jackson Games.  Development  Jeff Dee came up with the idea of creating a role-playing game based on cartoons when he, Greg Costikyan, and several other designers were talking about genres for which game systems had not yet been designed; although they agreed that such a game would be impossible to design, a few years later Costikyan designed Toon as a full game with the assistance of Warren Spector.  Style  Although Toon is a genuine role-playing game requiring the participation of players and a game master (called the \\"Animator\\"), it is designed with a tongue-in-cheek style that deliberately parodies many of the conventions of more standard, \\"serious\\" role-playing games. In Toon the player characters never die. As in many role- playing games, characters have hit points, which are deducted when the character is injured (usually in combat, or by having anvils fall on them). When characters are reduced to zero hit points they do not die or fall unconscious, but fall down. Since cartoon characters never actually die, and always return in time for the next scene, a fallen down character returns to play a set time later, with all hit points restored. This lack of true \\"character death\\" is also designed to encourage players to deliberately abandon the skills and reflexes they learned in other games, namely to have their characters able to solve problems and fight enemies while staying alive. According to the game's rules, the two prime directives for Toon players to follow are \\"Forget Everything You Know\\" and \\"Act Before You Think\\". The game encourages players to have fun above all other considerations - even to the point of breaking the rules of the game. If the players and the Animator agree that a players' actions in a game are funny and enjoyable, then that players' actions are allowed and encouraged. This can be seen as a way for players to \\"break the fourth wall\\" in the game, in the same way that animated cartoons often ignore reality for the sake of laughs. The game uses a very simple skill-based task resolution system based on a list of only 23 skills that cover all possible character actions. These are assigned to four controlling attributes, humorously named \\"Muscle\\" (strength), \\"Zip\\" (dexterity and speed), \\"Smarts\\" (intelligence) and \\"Chutzpah\\" (pushiness and self-confidence). In addition, characters can have optional \\"Shticks\\", which give them unusual cartoon-like abilities, such as flying or invisibility. The game was inspired by the classic Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1930s through the 1960s, and characters such as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, but Steve Jackson Games is careful to avoid any copyright violations. For example, there is an \\"Ace Corporation\\" in Toon products (instead of the Acme Corporation), and the writers' guidelines for Toon prohibit the use of the word \\"toon\\" to mean \\"a cartoon character\\".Writing For Toon  Toon books  * Toon: The Cartoon Roleplaying Game - 1984, out of print. * Toon Silly Stuff - 1985, out of print. * Son of Toon - 1985, out of print. * Toon Strikes Again - 1985, out of print. * Toon: The Cartoon Roleplaying Game (Deluxe Edition) - 1991.

Reception In the December 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue #92), Michael Dobson commented that the game \\"appears at first glance to be an elaborate joke.\\" But then he went on to say that \\"Toon is a genuinely good idea ‚Äî an original (if unlikely) concept in role-playing ‚Äî that is enjoyable, fast-moving, and incredibly silly.\\" Dobson liked the simplicity of the rules system, and concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \\"Inspired silliness ‚Äî the very heart of this game.\\" In the December 1984 edition of Imagine (Issue #21), Mike Lewis liked the game, stating, \\"Toon is a very refreshing change from the usual run-of- the-mill rpgs which have been appearing recently. The game very firmly puts a sense of humour back into rpgs. If you are interested in cartoons, then Toon is an essential purchase - but even if you aren't, try it for a change. I am very impressed with the ideas behind this game and hope that it gets more support than most minority RPGs have done in the past. It deserves it.\\" In the January‚ÄìFebruary 1985 edition of Space Gamer (No. 72), R.A. Greer gave a positive review, commenting, \\"Toon is a quick cure for all your roleplaying ills, a fast-acting balm to be applied directly to your funny bone, speeding you back to those uncomplicated days of roleplaying when it was fun!\\" In the January‚ÄìFebruary 1985 edition of Different Worlds (Issue #38), Larry DiTillio found much to like and gave the game a solid three stars out of four. He called the character generation rules \\"dirt simple\\", and found that resolving skills \\"is even easier than generating characters.\\" He also admired the writing style, saying \\"[Greg] Costikyan has clarity, wit, and the good sense to be brief, as well as an obvious love for cartoons. The rulebook not only reads quickly and easily, it makes you eager to play the game.\\" DiTillio concluded \\"for a few hours of silliness, Toon can't be beat and is a refreshing change from the ofttimes leaden pace of other role-playing games. It's fast, it's fun, it's simple.\\" In the March 1985 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #63), Stephen Kyle gave the game an excellent overall rating of 9 out of 10, stating that \\"all of us have favourite cartoons or characters and Toon enables you to recreate them easily and with a lot of fun.\\" In the April 1989 edition of Dragon (Issue #144), Jim Bambra took a retrospective look at the then five-year old game, and called it \\"a classic ‚Äî a game which deserves the attention of everyone looking for a dramatic change of pace and emphasis in their role-playing.\\" Bambra complimented the easy rules and flexible system, and concluded, \\"I highly recommend it as an evening‚Äôs entertainment and as a cure to role-playing blues. Buy a copy if you are in a silly mood or need to be cheered up.\\" Other reviews *Shadis #28 (1996) * Casus Belli #23 (Dec 1984)  See also  * Cartoon * Cartoon physics  References   External links  * Toon: The Cartoon Roleplaying Game Category:Comedy role-playing games Category:Furry role-playing games Category:Greg Costikyan games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1984 Category:Steve Jackson Games games ","title":"Toon (role-playing game)"},{"id":"644929","text":"Luis Eduardo Aponte Yuripe (born June 14, 1953) is a retired Venezuelan professional baseball player.

The sign has since been relocated to the highway's new bypass. Wasaga Beach (variant: Wasaga) is a town in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada. Situated along the longest freshwater beach in the world, it is a popular summer tourist destination. It is located along the southern end of Georgian Bay, approximately two hours north of Toronto. To the west, Collingwood and The Blue Mountains also attract visitors much of the year. The town is situated along a very long sandy beach on Nottawasaga Bay in Georgian Bay and the winding Nottawasaga River. The beaches are part of the Wasaga Beach Provincial Park; the park area totals 168 hectares (415 acres). Wasaga Beach has a year round population of 20,675 as of 2016, but during the summer months the population increases with many seasonal residents. The economy has struggled for some years, particularly since a major fire in late November 2007 destroyed many of the stores. It depends on tourists in an area where the primary shopping season is three to four months per year. In March 2017, the town passed its Downtown Development Master Plan, a 20-year strategy for significant redevelopment of the tourist area and adding a downtown to the business area. The goal is to improve tourism, diversify the economy, and get beyond its \\"party town\\" image. History Wasaga Beach and the surrounding area was inhabited by the Iroquoian-speaking Huron (Wendat) people for centuries before they were dispersed in 1649 by the English and Dutch-allied Haudenosaunee (Known as the Five Nation Iroquois Confederacy). The word Nottawasaga is of Algonquin origin. Nottawa means \\"Iroquois\\" and saga means \\"mouth of the river\\"; the word \\"Nottawasaga\\" was used by Algonquin scouts as a warning if they saw Iroquois raiding parties approaching their villages. In the early 1800s, Upper Canada was drawn into a struggle between Great Britain and the United States. Wasaga Beach became a strategic location in the War of 1812 when the schooner HMS Nancy was sunk at her moorings in an effort by the Americans to cut the supply line to Fort Michilimackinac and points to the north and west. Lumbering was the main industry for the remainder of the 19th century. Logs were floated downriver and into the bay, gathered at ports to feed local saw mills. Because Wasaga Beach had sandy soil unsuitable for cultivation, it did not attract early European settlement. In the 1820s the first sign of settlement in the area began as John Goessman surveyed Flos Township. In 1826, land was being sold for four shillings an acre. Though unsuitable for farming, the Wasaga Beach area had an abundance of trees. In the late 1830s and throughout the rest of the century, the logging industry was key to the economy and integral to development of the area. During the 1900s, families began to discover the beauty of the area. The beach gradually became a place for family picnics and holidays during the summer months. During the 1940s, servicemen stationed at a nearby military base visited Wasaga Beach's amusement park, and they made Wasaga Beach known across the country. After the war, Wasaga Beach continued to be a popular place for cottages and day trips. For a century, city dwellers traveled to the beach in the summer. Wasaga Beach entered history's headlines in 1934. It was the site of departure for the first overseas flight from mainland Canada across the Atlantic to England. A plane called the Trail of the Caribou used Wasaga Beach's long, flat, sandy beach as a take-off strip. The town was originally referred to as \\"the northern border of Flos Sunnidale and Nottawasaga Townships\\". The first municipal reference occurred with a designation of a Local Improvement District in 1947. In 1949, Wasaga Beach was classified as a police village in the Township of Sunnidale, and was incorporated as a village in 1951. The incorporation of the Town of Wasaga Beach became effective January 1, 1974. The permanent population stood at 4,034, a dramatic increase from 1965, when 500 people were residents. In the early 21st century, the town has 20,665 full-time residents and 16,000 seasonal and part-time residents. Wasaga Beach fire Main Street Mall as it appeared in August 2000. Fire destroyed most of the buildings in November 2007. On November 30, 2007, a major fire destroyed 90 per cent of the buildings along the street mall in the Beach One area. About 17 seasonal businesses were said to have been affected, including bikini shops, ice cream parlours, a restaurant, a motel, and an arcade. Nearly 100 firefighters from surrounding areas battled the blaze for hours. The Toronto Star later reported that \\"Twenty-one businesses in eight buildings overlooking Georgian Bay were destroyed, causing an estimated $5 million in damages.\\" Controversy also arose over whether or not the fire was deliberately set in order to allow unobstructed progression with the planned development or whether it was simply an accident. Two young men (one from Barrie and the other from Springwater) were charged with arson. There was no indication that the fire was deliberately set to remove old buildings in advance of planned development. The Town of Wasaga Beach worked out a plan to help the remaining businesses open for the season but the hotels, theme park and a monorail were cancelled and never revived.  Local government  The town's council includes a mayor, deputy mayor, and five councillors that are elected at-large. The members of council elected as of the 2018 municipal election are: Mayor: Nina Bifolchi Deputy Mayor: Sylvia Bray Councillors: * Joe Belanger * David Foster * Mark Kinney * George Watson * Stan Wells  Economic challenges  Despite the major fire, the beach and the remaining businesses reopened the following summer. Although the destroyed buildings had been considered dated, they were missed by residents and visitors. In 2008, an entertainment dome was built, intended as a temporary structure until development started. It lasted until February 2011 when the exterior cover was destroyed during a storm; repairs were not done and the dome never reopened. The structure was removed in May 2012. The long-term plans after the fire, by the Levy brothers' Blue Beach Avenue corporation, included a rebuild of the area in a modern style with shopping, an indoor/outdoor theme park, two major hotels and monorail service. The proposed development came to an abrupt end when Blue Beach Avenue declared bankruptcy in 2010. \\"The past couple of years haven't been kind to the tourist industry ... So I gather there were some major cash shortfalls that put them in this situation,\\" the town's mayor said at that time. One of the Levy brothers was charged with fraud in 2012 after an investigation of misappropriation of the insurance money paid out after the 2007 fire. Reduced tourism, partly because of the loss of many retail buildings, has continued to be a problem in the area. The majority of sales take place during the tourist season, which is typically not much longer than three months per year. (The most recent stats indicate a decline in tourism \\"of roughly 100,000 a year between 2002 and 2012\\".) To step up development, in 2015 the town spent $13.5 million to purchase seven properties, including eight buildings and 28 rental units, along Beach Area One, becoming a landlord to some businesses, including three bars. The town acquired any existing leases from tenants and succeeded in leasing most of the empty space to commercial enterprises by July 2016. A few of the tenants subsequently enquired about the possibility of breaking their leases because they were struggling financially. The town council agreed to a one-time opportunity for businesses to break their leases without a penalty; requests to do so had to be submitted no later than September 23, 2016. The beach is owned and operated by Ontario Parks as the Wasaga Beach Provincial Park, and it is the area's primary attraction. Of the six main beach areas, Beach areas One and Two and the adjacent private/public lands have historically functioned as the main destination for tourism activity. Due to the economic climate, losses due to fires, and recent failed private redevelopment plans, Beach areas One and Two have been in steady decline. This area is so important to the town that it undertook an in-depth community visioning exercise, called Opportunity Wasaga, to develop a long-term vision for the future of the public and private lands in this area. There has been a great deal of controversy (among the public and council members) about the previous strategies used by the Town of Wasaga Beach, including the 2015 purchase of the seven properties for $13.8 million, using borrowed money. \\"That's no small sum for the town of 18,000 that will collect $20.3 million in property taxes this year and spend $48 million in operating and capital costs,\\" according to a report by the Toronto Star.  New development plan  An entirely new Downtown Development Master Plan was released by town council in late January 2017, with an estimate for capital investment of $625 million and a 20 plus year time frame for completion. The first phase (five to 10 years) will cost about $200 million for two development areas, one on the beach and one on the main land. In July 2018, under the council led by then-mayor Brian Smith, council agreed to enter into a Letter of Intent with FRAM Building Group for the development of town-owned land in the downtown and at the beachfront. In December 2018, under a new council, with Nina Bifolchi as mayor, council decided to undertake a review of the development of town-owned lands in the downtown and at the beachfront. The council agreed to let the Letter of Intent the town had with FRAM Building Group Ltd. lapse at the end of December 2018 as a first step in the review process. The Downtown Master Plan, however, remains in place. In March 2019, FRAM advised the town it is not interested in being a part of future development of the beachfront. The town is now looking for developers interested in developing town-owned land at the beachfront. Wasaga Beach Provincial Park Wasaga Beach Provincial Park is a small recreational provincial park consisting of the eight beaches with of beach. Beach Areas 1-6 can be accessed off Mosley Street in Wasaga. Allenwood and New Wasaga Beaches are north of the Nottawasaga River and are accessed via River Road East. The park is available for day use only. Its area totals of which are protected. The park is a habitat for birds, primarily for shorebirds including the endangered piping plover. Hiking trails of over are available. In winter, they are used for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. The visitor centre provides access to the Nancy Island Historic Site with a theatre, a museum and a lighthouse. Geography Beach 1 (the main beach) looking west with Beaches 2 and 3 in the distance A cottage-lined side street Over two million people visit Wasaga Beach every summer, attracted by the town's freshwater beach (stretching ), swim in shallow (warm), clean water and enjoy the panoramic views of the Niagara Escarpment across the bay. There are many recreational trails that are used for hiking, cycling, cross-country skiing and snowmobiling. The Nottawasaga River offers game fishing and canoe routes. The beach is divided into sections, with the beaches numbered 1 to 6 from east to west, with off-beach public park areas, mostly with parking and all with toilet facilities. A published summary indicates that Beaches 2‚Äì4 benefit from shade trees, a bike trail and a playground. Beach 1 is the most touristy, with bars, beach-themed shops and fast food restaurants, attracting primarily young adults. Beach areas 3 to 6 have many seasonal waterfront cottages between the park areas; Shore Lane Road is used for jogging, biking and roller blading. There are two additional beaches nearby, New Wasaga Beach and Allenwood Beach that are cut off from the 1‚Äì6 areas by the river; these also have seasonal residents. The town publishes a map of all of these areas. An unusual aspect of the town compared to other Ontario Cottage country communities, is that most of the summer homes are non-waterfront and are closely spaced on an extensive grid of side streets within the town itself, rather than being located on larger lots in more rustic settings often well outside the said towns as is the typical case elsewhere. In the summer months it is a popular place for beach volleyball and sunbathing. A boardwalk runs most of the way along Beach 1 and 2. Beach 1 draws the largest crowds, with the popularity of the beaches decreasing further west. East of the town limits, the sandy beach continues east and north into Tiny Beaches, nearly as far as the tip of the Penetang peninsula. The beach in these areas is also fronted by many cottages and homes, but unlike in Wasaga Beach, the beaches are mostly private property. The beach's position on the waters of Nottawasaga Bay means that summer temperatures are moderated somewhat by the water, so summer days can be quite comfortable especially when there is a breeze off Georgian Bay. In winter, however, winds off the water trigger very heavy and intense snow squalls. Due to these heavy snowfalls, activities include snowmobiling, cross- country skiing and other winter sports. Downhill skiing is available at nearby Blue Mountain. There are many miles of fresh groomed trails for snowmobiling thanks to the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs and in part to the purchasers of the trail passes. The town also has several community centres, including the Rec-Plex, which has an auditorium, an amphitheatre and a YMCA, as well as the Wasaga Stars Arena. Land area, geology and topography Aerial view of Wasaga Beach from the southwest, 2013 The Town of Wasaga Beach covers an area of comprised predominantly of sand and loamy sand that exhibit excessive to good drainage and irregular to moderately sloping topography. The poor soil quality makes it difficult to sustain lush lawns in the town. The Canada Land Inventory for Agriculture rates the lands as predominately Class Six and Seven with primary restrictions of adverse topography, erosion damage and low natural fertility. Demographics The 2006 Canadian census indicated a population of 15,029 residents. When compared to its 2001 population of 12,419, Wasaga Beach is one of the fastest growing communities in Canada based on population growth percentage (21.0% over 5 years). Education There are several elementary schools: Worsley, Birchview Dunes, and St. Noel Chabanel (Catholic); and a private school, Silvercrest Christian School. There are no high schools in town. As of February 2017, there was no plan by the Simcoe County District School Board to build a secondary school. Buses transport over 760 students to high schools located outside the town, in Stayner, Elmvale, and Collingwood. Schools in Wasaga Beach: * Birchview Dunes Elementary School ** Principal: Melissa Mortimer * Worsley Elementary School ** Principal: Darrell Bax * St Noel Chabanal Elementary School ** Principal: Steve Charlebois Wasaga Beach Transit Transit service in Wasaga Beach is operated by Georgian Coach Lines, using town-owned buses, under the name Wasaga Beach Transit. The service was started with one route in July 2008, and quickly expanded to two routes in the summer of 2009. Services for Wasaga Beach Transit occur in a loop from the Wasaga Stars Arena in the east to the Real Canadian Superstore in the west every hour from 7 am to 7 pm. There is a transit link between Wasaga Beach and Collingwood that operates on a continuous loop. Transit service in Wasaga Beach is no longer operated by Georgian Coach Lines. The contract was changed in the summer of 2014 to Sinton-Landmark Bus Lines.

Geography  The town is north west of the state capital Brisbane and west of the regional city of Rockhampton. The Central Western railway line passes through the town which was once served by the Bogantungan railway station. The small number of houses in the town are located around the railway station. The Capricorn Highway once passed through the town but now bypasses it to the north. History The name Bogantungan derives from Aboriginal words \\"bogan\\" meaning \\"grass\\" and \\"tungan\\" meaning \\"tree\\". The Central Western railway was built in sections, beginning at Rockhampton and then heading west. Each section involved establishing a temporary settlement to accommodate the workers while they were building the railway. After that section was complete, the workers moved further west were a new settlement was established. Although intended as temporary, some of these settlements continued to survive after the railway workers had moved on, becoming permanent towns. Bogantungan was one of these. In its heyday, it was a town of some thousands of people, with around 30 hotels. In March 1881, the Queensland Government held a land sale, auctioning 48 town lots in the town of Bogantungan. Bogantungan Post Office opened on 8 July 1881 and closed in 1982. Bogantungan State School opened on 19 March 1883. It closed on 11 August 1972. On 26 February 1960, Bogantungan was the site of the Medway Creek rail disaster, one of Queensland's worst train accidents. The Midlander passenger train, heading east to Rockhampton, passed over the flooded Medway Creek, just west of the town. The bridge collapsed when the train was partly over, with a number of carriages dropping into the water. A total of 4 passengers and 3 crew were killed, with 43 injured.  Attractions  Boguntungan Railway Station is now a small historical museum and rest area, with a memorial and interpretive panels about the rail disaster and the railway buildings.  Education  There are no schools in Bogantungan. The nearest primary schools are in Lochington ( south by minor roads), Anakie ( east on the Capricorn Highway) or Alpha ( west on the Capricorn Highway). The nearest secondary school is in Alpha (to Year 10 only). The nearest secondary school offering education to Year 12 is Emerald State High School in Emerald ( east on the Capricorn Highway). Other secondary alternatives are distance education and boarding schools.

Dedicated in 1976, the complex consists of three components: a landscaped garden and non-denominational chapel building, a major section of the underground pedestrian network, and the Bullington Truck Terminal. It was the first public-private partnership of its kind in Dallas. Concept In 1964, four businessmen wanted the City of Dallas to be known not only for its worldly aspirations and economic accomplishments, but also for the enduring heart of its citizens. Researchers and spiritual leaders discovered a long history of giving and living thanks in Dallas. Thanksgiving, which is gratitude in action, was recognized as a human universal present in cultures and faith traditions around the world. The Thanks-Giving Foundation was started to create a public space in the center of Dallas dedicated in gratitude to God and to this most ancient and enduring tradition. Partnering with the City of Dallas, construction began in 1973 and the Square was dedicated in November 1976 as one of the city's three United States Bicentennial projects. President Gerald Ford later recognized Thanks-Giving Square as a major national shrine. It welcomes people of all cultures and religions are welcome to celebrate values, thoughts, and spirituality in a contemplative setting. http://www.thanksgiving.org/thanks-giving- square/visit/tour/ Concurrent to private development, the City of Dallas constructed transportation infrastructure below the landscaped garden. The City of Dallas leases the land and subsurface from the Thanks-Giving Foundation, but owns the underground structures. The garden, chapel, and grounds Thanks-Giving Square generally refers to the garden and facilities visible at street level, which are owned and operated by the non-profit Thanks-Giving Foundation. Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Philip Johnson was commissioned to bring the vision of Thanks-Giving Square to life. The Square is set fifteen feet below ground level with a four-foot wall blocking the sight of automobiles to create a serene, green island. Water plays a prominent role in the landscape, with active fountains masking city noise. Overt Religious symbolism is intentionally absent from the decoration of Thanks-Giving Square. Granite markers include references from Scripture, and the 100th Psalm is featured prominently in quotes and messages as delineated by Hindu, Jewish, Christian and Muslim authorities. Mosaic, stained glass, engraving, and graphic art adorn the walls and windows throughout Thanks- Giving Square. Court of All Nations At the western end of the park is the Court of All Nations, the ceremonial entryway that contains the Wall of Praise (featuring a portion of the text from Psalms 100) and Norman Rockwell's \\"Golden Rule\\" mosaic. The Ring of Thanks is a 14-foot (4 m) diameter aluminum ring is covered in 23 carat (96%) gold leaf. Visitors can walk through the ring before passing under a 50-foot (15 m) Bell Tower featuring three bronze bells designed in the form of the Liberty Bell. Center Court of Praise In the middle of the garden is the Center Court of Praise, which takes inspiration from public gathering spaces around the world. It is here that special events have celebrated ‚Äúgratitude on the move‚Äù through speech, song, and dance. The aluminum and gold ring and nearby text reference this message found in Psalm 100. This area regularly holds special events, memorial services, and citywide prayer vigils (such as the one held after the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers). Grove The Grove is a garden area designed for meditation and contemplation. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush dedicated the Wall of Presidents, a special display area celebrating the prayer and thanksgiving words of American presidents. Hall of Thanksgiving Below the chapel is the Hall of Thanksgiving, which tells the story of the American Thanksgiving tradition. The Hall of Thanksgiving is the exhibition, meeting, and resource center for Thanks-Giving Square. The pillared hall receives dignitaries and provides a forum for lectures, interfaith meetings, and educational programming. Artifacts on display include the Book of Prayers and Presidential Proclamations. Chapel of Thanksgiving The Chapel of Thanksgiving is the spiritual center of Thanks- Giving Square open to visitors of all faiths. The spiraling shape rises 90 feet (27.5 m) above street level, suggesting the infinite upward reach of the human spirit. The Chapel‚Äôs design takes its inspiration from the Great Mosque in Samarra, Iraq (itself derived from the square, spiral Pillar of Gor in Persiahttp://rch.ac.ir/article/Details?id=10224) and the ancient spiral of life. The entrance to the chapel is at the end of a 125-foot (38 m) bridge that runs over a cascading waterfall. The chapel ceiling contains the stained glass \\"Glory Window\\", one of largest horizontally mounted stained-glass pieces in the world. The 73 panels of faceted glass were designed by Gabriel Loire of Chartres, France featuring warmer and brighter colors as the spiral reaches its apex in the center. The window appears in a shot in director Terrence Malick's 2011 film The Tree of Life. Above the entry door is the etched glass window \\"The Spirit of Thanksgiving,\\" designed by glass engraver John Hutton. Artwork by artist Bj√∏rn Wiinblad is also on display. Visitors are encouraged to leave a personal statement of gratitude upon entering.

Consecutive construction with the garden above allowed for skylights, wide walkways and several colorful atriums to disguise the fact that pedestrians are several feet underground. Unlike other portions of the pedway network that were privately constructed, the section beneath Thanks-Giving Square is operated by the City of Dallas. The network is accessed from the Center Court of Praise during business hours. Escalators bring the network to ground level at Bullington Street, which serves as a pedestrian mall and connects to the Bullington-Akard Skywalk. As of 2016, many of the access points have been closed. Bullington Truck Terminal Thanks-Giving Square was originally planned as the first of several traffic-relieving complexes in downtown Dallas. The Bullington Truck Terminal, one of the key features in the Ponte-Travers-designed plan for downtown circulation, was constructed to consolidate street-level delivery trucks following Dallas' rapid growth in the 1960s. By placing truck traffic below-grade, it was estimated that 350 trucks per day would be removed from ground-level streets. The city issued $6.5 million for the project as part of the 1972 city bond program; construction was finished in 1977.Dallas Morning News, 1974 The city-owned truck terminal lies 50 feet below ground and contains 43 spaces for trucks, which enter from a portal located at Patterson Street. Adjacent buildings such as the Republic Center, Energy Plaza, Thanksgiving Tower and Fidelity Union Tower built connections to the truck terminal at their own expense and use it as their primary loading dock. Despite plans for several similar facilities in the Dallas Central Business District; the Bullington Truck Terminal was the only one funded and completed.

It was released on February 21, 1998 in Japan, and manufacturing was ceased in late 2002. As a toy for user-generated content, it can be used to shoot grayscale photographs, edit them or create original drawings, and transfer images between GBC units or to the 64DD art game suite Mario Artist. The accessory featured a 180¬∞-swivel camera that allowed users to capture selfies. Its images can be printed to thermal paper with the Game Boy Printer. The GBC's cartridge contains minigames based on Nintendo's early games such as the arcade video game Space Fever and the Game & Watch handheld game Ball, and a chiptune music sequencer. Guinness recognized it as the world's smallest digital camera as of 1999, and photographers have embraced its technological limitations as artistic challenges. Overview Installed in a Game Boy Color, with the camera rotated The Game Boy Camera (GBC) interfaces with the Game Boy Printer, which utilizes thermal paper to print saved images. Both the camera and the printer were marketed by Nintendo as light-hearted entertainment devices aimed mainly at children in all three major video game regions of the world: Japan, North America, and Europe. N64 Magazine (which has since been superseded by NGamer) dedicated a monthly section to the device. The GBC is compatible with all of the Game Boy line except Game Boy Micro. Video output is possible via the Super Game Boy for the Super NES and the Game Boy Player for the GameCube. The camera has a 128√ó128 pixel CMOS sensor, and can store 128√ó112, grayscale digital images using the 4-color palette of the Game Boy system. The Game Boy Camera line has five different standard colors of models: blue, green, red, yellow, and clear purple (Japan only). There is a limited edition gold themed for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, which contains unique stamps, and was available only in the United States through a mail-order offer from Nintendo Power. Functionality A photo of a Ford Tempo taken with the GBC The camera is controlled, images are manipulated, and minigames are played by Game Boy software running from the camera's attached cartridge. Individual photographs can be taken and edited with features including a delay timer, time lapse, trick lenses like mirroring and scaling, montage, and panorama for stitching together component photos into one large image. The user can further edit the images by placing Nintendo's stamps, or by freehand doodles. Images can be combined as frames of an animation. Images can be interconnected with clickable hyperlinks in \\"hot spots\\" mode. Images can be transferred via the cable, to be printed on the Game Boy Printer, copied between GBC units, or copied via the Nintendo 64 controller's Transfer Pak to a 64DD floppy disk. The Japanese GBC is optionally integrated into the Mario Artist suite of multimedia games for the 64DD peripheral. There, users can create drawn and 3D-animated avatars of themselves based on photographs taken with the camera, integrate these personalized avatars into various 64DD games including Mario Artist and SimCity 64, or post art on the Internet through Randnet. Third party vendors have reverse engineered the GBC system to create modern transfer methods such as SD cards and Wi-Fi. The GBA cartridge's software has numerous references to other Nintendo products. There are a few differences between the North American and Japanese versions, including the unlockable B album pictures and the stamps that can be placed on pictures. The software has a few Easter eggs, some of which have been described as \\"creepy\\". Nintendo reportedly had plans to release a successor to the Game Boy Camera for the Game Boy Advance called the GameEyeNintendo Power June 2003 Issue. which would take color photos and feature connectivity with the GameCube through a game titled Stage Debut, but neither the GameEye nor Stage Debut were released. Minigames *Space Fever II is a sequel to the early Nintendo arcade game Space Fever. In this minigame, the player controls a spaceship which fires missiles at other ships throughout three unique levels, followed by a boss at the end of each level. The first boss is a giant face of a man with horns, the second boss is a giant face of a mustachioed man, and the third boss is the Game Face. Once all three of the bosses are beaten, the cycle will restart with increased difficulty. At the beginning of the game, two spaceships appear; shooting the \\"B\\" ship will enter the Ball minigame, and shooting the \\"D\\" ship will enter DJ. By avoiding both of the ships, the player will begin playing Space Fever II. After scoring 2,000 points there, a new minigame called Run! Run! Run! will be unlocked, where a new ship marked with a \\"?\\" will appear at the beginning. *Ball is a juggling game, in which the player moves the hand around to catch and throw balls. It is very similar to the Game & Watch game named Ball, only with Mr. Game & Watch's head replaced with the Game Face. The background music to this game is \\"Mayim Mayim\\", an Israeli folk song. *DJ is an open-ended music video game with a music sequencer known as Trippy-H where players can mix and create simple chiptunes. The Game Face is the DJ. *Run! Run! Run! is the bonus minigame. The \\"Game Face\\" is attached to a cartoon body, and the player races against a mole and a bird for the finish line. By clearing this minigame in under 22 seconds, the credits are unlocked. Development Jupiter and its moons taken with a GBC through a 10\\" telescope. Initially, the Game Boy Camera was not well received within Nintendo. However, Kuwahara approached Creatures, Inc. President Hirokazu Tanaka regarding the development of the software for the device, which solidified the project. The camera's built-in software was co-developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 and the Japanese company Jupiter, with Tanaka directing the project. Legacy As one of the earliest consumer digital cameras, the GBC has been legitimized for user-generated content, especially photography. Its severe technological limits are engaged for artistic challenge or nostalgic value, and modern personal computer connectivity methods have been improvised or commercially mass-produced for image retrieval. The GBC is featured in the 1999 edition of Guinness World Records for being the world's smallest digital camera, though this record has since been broken. In 2000, a professional photographer created a color workflow similar to the world's earliest color photography, to process GBC's grayscale photos through red, green, and blue filters to produce a color photograph. An artist using a Game Boy Camera and three colour process has developed a series of works since 2012, focussing on how the interplay between what the abstracted images reveal and conceal about the photographed environment. As well as using the Game Boy printer within his practice. A PhD student performed astrophotography of scenes including Jupiter, through academic telescopes using GBC. In 2017, a research engineer developed a neural network application to automatically convert GBC monochrome images into color images. Several modern smartphone apps have modes to simulate GBC image quality. In 2016, an Instagram artist included the vintage GBC hardware in his repertoire of high-technology stylized filters, creating a new gallery dedicated only to GBC photography, because its primitive camera \\"forces you to find a way to take beautiful pictures\\".

television broadcasting organization in Hungary. Headquartered in Budapest, it is the oldest television broadcaster in Hungary and today airs five channels: M1 HD, M2 HD, M3, M4 Sport and M5. MTV is managed and primarily funded by the Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (, abbreviated MTVA). This government organization, formed in 2011, also manages the public service broadcasters Magyar R√°di√≥ and Duna Telev√≠zi√≥ as well as the Hungarian news agency Magyar T√°virati Iroda. On 1 July 2015, Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥ as well as the three other public media organizations managed by the MTVA were merged into a single organization called (). This organization is the legal successor to Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥ and is an active member of the European Broadcasting Union. History  Early years (1954-1969) First pioneer transmissions were in Hotel Gell√©rt in 1936. Test transmissions commenced in 1954, however these were generally with stills or short clips of motion pictures, merely for experimental purposes. Regular test transmissions could be received from February 23, 1957. Transmissions began officially on 1 May 1957, when the May Day ceremonies were brought to the viewers for the first time. Daily news programmes began on July 2, 1957. The television service began its career as part of Hungarian Radio, which was renamed \\"Hungarian Radio and Television\\" on August 18, 1957. MTV suggested the establishment of an international organisation for exchanging television material, which was to be named Intervision. The first four members of the organisation were Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary and Poland. By 1959, Hungarian Television had over 50,000 subscribers. In 1960, the Corporation decided to establish an archive, where its programmes are stored even today. In less than ten years of operation, MTV had some 2.7 million viewers by 1964. Studies showed that there were about 3-5 viewers per television set. Another study revealed that by 1965, 46% of the inhabitants of rural areas named television as their choice of entertainment, instead of reading (25%) or radio (10%). Theatrical transmissions were popular at this time: in 1966 23 plays were broadcast from Budapest, 20 from other cities. Also, 25 television movies and five musicals were transmitted this year. 1969 brought the one millionth subscriber, which meant about 4 million viewers. The first colour recording was made this year: it was B√©la Bart√≥k's The Miraculous Mandarin. Although the Orion company presented its first colour television set, transmissions continued to be in black-and-white until 1971. The 1970s 1971 brought the first regular transmission in colour, and the test transmissions of a second channel were begun as well. This decade was probably the most proliferous in the history of the whole company, with thousands of hours of programming made. The 1980s Annual programming time reached 4.300 hours, equalling to 83 hours a week. Teletext services commenced in 1981, called K√©p√∫js√°g (Picture Newspaper), and television manufacturers started including teletext decoders in their sets. Long-running programmes were started in this decade, including Ablak (Window) and Panor√°ma (a foreign affairs programme). Regional programming began in 1984 in P√©cs, and cable television began in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r the same year. RTV, a programme guide similar to BBC's Radio Times was bought by 1.4 million viewers weekly. MTV's gradual decline began in 1985, this was the final year when MTV was self-sufficient. The first broadcast of a telenovela on Hungarian television happened in the mid-1980s with the premier of the Brazilian Escrava Isaura (Hungarian title: Rabszolgasors - \\"Slave Destiny\\" in English). The first Hungarian soap opera Szomsz√©dok (Hungarian for \\"Neighbours\\") also started its 12-year-run on 7 May 1987 and was broadcast every second Thursday.Szomsz√©dok on IMDb By the late 1980s, experimental digital television recordings were made, but at the time only in studios. From 1988 seniors of 70 years were exempted from payment of the licence fee. Minority programmes in other languages began too: these programmes were recorded generally in regional studios, primarily in P√©cs and Szeged. MTV2 was given some independence from its sister channel MTV1, and just like at the BBC, they were given separate controllers. By 1989 the service began broadcasting five days per week to prepare the seven days, as previously Monday only. Some exceptions were made from this practice, for example when the first Hungarian cosmonaut, Bertalan Farkas entered space. Nap-kelte (Daybreak), a daily television magazine programme began in 1989, the first programme to be made by an independent Hungarian television company, namely Nap-TV. The 1990s With the changeover from communism( renszerv√°lt√°s-change of regime in 1989), MTV was completely re-structured, some posts were abolished while others were created. Some programmes were axed from both channels, and new ones were started. This decade was a very hectic time in the life of the Company, as TV-presidents seemed to come and go, and so did the programmes. MTV was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union on January 1, 1993 upon the merger of OIRT and EBU. In 1992, a new public service television station was started, and was named Duna Telev√≠zi√≥. This was completely independent from MTV, although some collaboration exists between the two. Commercial channels became available to cable viewers in Budapest the same year. In 1997, TV2, a commercial channel was to be launched on the frequency where m2 used to be. However, MTV argued that by doing this, its audience would be given to the new channel as a present, which would mean severe disadvantage to both MTV and RTL Klub, the other debuting commercial channel. The authorities decided to leave the frequency empty, and allocate a new frequency to TV2. m2, however, was still moved to satellite and cable reception only, which, at the time was quite rare. The programming available on MTV-2 was aimed at audiences which were most unlikely to receive the channel, so this meant a severe handicap for the company. Currently the company is recuperating from the decline earlier. During the 1990s the MTV gradually lost its independence and became the voice of the all-time government, often accused of biased on commenting news . It is one of the most popular sources of news, and its background news programmes such as Az Este (The Evening) are both liked and internationally recognised. Its line-up of programmes feature long-running shows, such as the science news programme Delta, whilst other programmes like A H√©t (The Week), a weekly review programme and Ablak (Window), an afternoon-long umbrella programme featuring general interest programmes, were both axed in recent years. The 2000s MTV is continuously underfinanced, just like many other public service channels around the globe, and is therefore struggling to produce programmes. Whilst remaining entirely state-owned, the company was re- organised as a Closely Held Corporation. Funding changed significantly in 2002 with the end of the mandatory television license fee levied on all household with a television set. Following this change, funding for MTV instead began to come from government grants and advertising. The 2006 protests didn't leave the headquarters unscathed; in fact, it was occupied by the rioters for a short time. In 2000, m2 began broadcasting 24 hours a day, with repeats from its sister channel, m1 and from its archive library and from the Hungarian National Digital Archive and Film Institute (Magyar Nemzeti Digit√°lis Arch√≠vum √©s Filmint√©zet). Present-day In 2011, most of the assets and employees of MTV were transferred to the newly created Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (, abbreviated MTVA), a government organization controlled by the Media Council of Hungary. Magyar R√°di√≥ and Duna Telev√≠zi√≥ were also made a part of the MTVA, which, together with MTV, unified all three public service broadcasters in Hungary for the first time. Additionally, the Hungarian news agency Magyar T√°virati Iroda was merged into the MTVA and has since been responsible for the production of all news content aired on the three broadcasting organizations. In 2015, the unification of all the public media organizations managed by the MTVA was strengthened when all four were merged into a single organization called Duna Media Service (). This nonprofit organization is the legal successor to the four formerly separate entities managed by the MTVA. The creation of the MTVA and transfer of the public media organizations into it has been frequently criticised by non-governmental organizations as being politically motivated and intended to the lessen the independence of the public service media in Hungary. The government has stated that restructuring was necessary to improve the finances of the public media system and that all of the organizations within the MTVA retain editorial independence. In 2012, MTV launched M3D, first 3D television in Hungary. MTV trademark suit Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥, who has a trademark on the initials MTV registered with the Hungarian copyright office, sued the American MTV Music Television network for trademark infringement when MTV Music Television launched a Hungarian-language channel in 2007. The suit is still ongoing. Notable shows * On the Spot, documentary film series Location Aerial photography of the old headquarters on Szabads√°g t√©r The Hungarian Television's central building was located in the heart of Budapest on Szabads√°g t√©r (Freedom Square), across the Hungarian National Bank (Magyar Nemzeti Bank), the U.S. Embassy, and near to the Parliament. The building gave room to the Stock Exchange before the war. It is sold now and MTV has moved to the outskirts of Budapest to a purpose-built modern building. The old headquarters can be reached by a five minutes walk from Kossuth t√©r where Metro line 2 stops.

Usage of the term varies under different jurisdictions. Republic of Ireland Town Councils in the Republic of Ireland were the second tier of local government under counties, and date from 2002, when the existing Urban District Councils and Town Commissioners were redesignated, until the town councils were abolished under the Local Government Reform Act 1842 There were previously 75 such councils. Belize There are currently seven town councils in Belize. Each town council consists of a mayor and a number of councillors, who are directly elected in municipal elections every three years. Town councils in Belize are responsible for a range of functions, including street maintenance and lighting, drainage, refuse collection, public cemeteries, infrastructure, parks and playgrounds. England and Wales In England, since the Local Government Act 1972, \\"town council\\" is the specific name given to a civil parish council which has declared itself by resolution to be a town council. If another type of local council, such as a district authority, covers a single town (such as Corby or Cheltenham) then the council is often a 'borough council': borough status is however conferred at the discretion of the Crown. Civil parishes are the most local level in the local government system. The higher levels are district, unitary and county. However town councils are not subordinate in democratic accountability to those higher levels, but to the electorate of their civil parish area. The chairman of a town council is entitled to be styled as \\"town mayor\\". This term contrasts with simply \\"mayor\\", which means the mayor of a borough or a city. However, this is often abbreviated simply to mayor, especially where the town was historically a borough or city, such as Lewes or Ely. In Scotland, the term 'provost' is commonly used to designate the leader of the town council. Historically the term 'town council' was used for the governing body of a municipal borough until the 1972 Act. In Wales, where the lowest tier of local government is known as a community, the Community Council may unilaterally declare itself to be a Town Council, but this has the same status as a Community Council. Canada Ontario Township councils in Ontario play a similar role as city councils in cities for smaller or low tier municipalities. Directly elected every four years, the number of councillors vary depending on the size of their municipalities. The councillors powers and responsibilities are governed by the Municipal Act, 2001. Manitoba Manitoba town council members serve primarily as a policy and direction board for the community. They consist of five to seven members with the head of council being the mayor or reeve. United States Indiana Indiana town council members serve as both the executive and legislative branches for small communities incorporated as towns within the state. They consist of three or five members, depending upon the town's population. Unlike some states, Indiana councilmembers must declare a political party affiliation, if any, when they file to run for office. Upon election in November, they are sworn in before 1 January of the following year, where they serve a four-year term. There are no state term limits affecting how many times a candidate may run for re-election to office. The first meeting after an election, members of the town council hold an organising meeting, where they elect a president to set future agendas and act as an official spokesman for the town or as liaison between the town and state and county government. Indiana town councils work in conjunction with an elected town clerk, who manages the day-to-day business of the municipal government. As an elected official, the town clerk is solely executive in function and operates independently of the town council. But the council has final say on budgets which clerks depend upon to operate. In addition to a clerk, the council can authorise the hiring of other staff to run the operations of government, including law enforcement officers, utility workers, park and recreation employees and town managers. These employees serve at the pleasure of the council. Massachusetts Town councils in Massachusetts are essentially city councils in towns which have adopted a city form of government but prefer to retain the \\"town of\\" in their names. In several communities which have adopted such a government, the official name of the community is \\"The City known as the Town of...\\" The legislative body of a legal town in Massachusetts is a town meeting; the executive board is a board of selectmen. In addition to having the structure of a city with a mayor and council, cities in Massachusetts can enact ordinances, while towns may adopt by-laws, which are subject to the approval of the Attorney General. City ordinances are presumed to be legal unless challenged and set aside in court. See Massachusetts Government. Michigan In Michigan, there are 257 incorporated villages that are governed by village councils, which is a form of weak‚Äìmayor administration. Michigan does not use \\"town\\" as a defined municipality, and villages are the lowest-level form of incorporated municipality. Villages are distinct from cities in that they share certain duties with their surrounding township and are not completely autonomous. Guidelines for village governments are defined in the General Law Village Act (Act 3) of 1895. Village councils consist of elected officials, including a village president, trustees, clerk, and treasurer. New Hampshire In New Hampshire, the Town Council is an elected body which serves as the legislative and executive body of the town. The town is governed by a charter, which is allowed under the home rule provision of the New Hampshire Constitution (Pt I, Art. 39) and Title III of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated. The charter for a Town Council must meet the following requirements of RSA 49-D:3 I. (a) ‚Äì (e) and all other applicable laws. The basic notion of home rule in New Hampshire is that local communities are not allowed to supersede the authority specifically granted to them by the state. =Official Ballot Town Council= The Official Ballot Town Council is a variant form of the Town Council. In the Official Ballot form of government, the town council is vested with the limited authority to vote on all matters not voted on by official ballot. The authority and restrictions on the Official Ballot town council is the same as the Town Council, except with respect to those matters specified to be voted on by official ballot. Also, the council decides what is placed on the ballot, not the registered voters. The charter of the Official Ballot Town Council is required by law to specify specifically: *Which budgetary items to be included on the official ballot; and *A finalisation process for the annual budget; and *Process for public hearings, debate, discussion and amendment of questions to be placed on the official ballot; and *Procedures for the transfer of funds among various departments, funds, accounts and agencies as may be necessary during the year; and *Applicability of the official ballot procedure to special elections The charter also must specify whether a or majority vote is required to approve bonds or notes, with the default being . Palestinian Authority The Palestinian National Authority established village councils to serve as local administrations and service providers for Palestinian villages and small towns. Village councils are also referred to as D-level municipalities. Singapore In Singapore, town councils are in charge of maintaining the common areas of Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats and estates, such as the common corridors, void decks, lifts, water tanks, external lighting and the open spaces surrounding the estates. They are regulated under the . The rationale was to delegate the duties of estate management to the members of parliament in addition to their existing responsibilities. They would also gain management experience and be accountable to their district's resident voters. Town councils boundaries are drawn based on electoral districts boundaries. A town council area can consist of a Group Representation Constituency (GRC), a Single Member Constituency (SMC), or a collection of neighbouring GRCs and SMCs controlled by the same political party. The Members of Parliament head the town councils of their constituencies. Town councils boundaries do not correspond to new town boundaries; different parts of the same HDB town may be managed by different town councils.

The dorsum of the head is shiny black, the upper and lower labial scales are white with black markings on the anterior edge of the scales. Body color is either brownish-violet fading to yellowish ventrally (B. albertisii) or blackish-blue fading to gray. These pythons occasionally regurgitate fur balls, or castings, a few days after feeding on a furred prey item. Behavior Although mostly terrestrial, these snakes can and are known to occasionally climb. White-lipped pythons are reportedly aggressive, though this is reduced in those born and raised in captivity. These snakes have also been observed to regularly regurgitate fur balls from their prey. Geographic range These snakes are found in most of New Guinea (below 1200 m), including the islands of Salawati and Biak, Normanby, Mussau and Emirau, as well as a few islands in the Torres Strait.

Habitat Associated with rain forests, cutover clearings and swamps, they are usually found near water, into which they may quickly retreat if disturbed. They often hide under dead leaves on forest floor. Feeding The diet includes a range of small- to medium-sized birds and mammals. Neonates and juveniles often feed on lizards. Heat sensitive pits in the upper and lower jaws are used to help locate prey during nocturnal hunting. Reproduction The oviparous females lay about a dozen eggs. The eggs stick together in a compact pile, and the females coils around them. The hatchlings emerge after about two months of incubation and are about in length.

It has been edited together into a five-hour film for distribution in the United Kingdom and United States. The series is set in the neurosurgical ward of Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet, the city and country's main hospital, nicknamed \\"Riget\\". \\"Riget\\" means \\"the realm\\" or \\"the kingdom\\", and leads one to think of \\"d√∏dsriget\\", the realm of the dead. The show follows a number of characters, both staff and patients, as they encounter bizarre phenomena, both human and supernatural. The show is notable for its wry humor, its muted sepia colour scheme, and the appearance of a chorus of dishwashers with Down syndrome who discuss in intimate detail the strange occurrences in the hospital. The first quartet of episodes ended with numerous questions unanswered, and in 1997, the cast reassembled to produce another group of four episodes, Riget II (The Kingdom II). This second series ended with even more questions unanswered than the first, and a third series was planned. However, due to the death in 1998 of Ernst-Hugo J√§reg√•rd (who played Stig Helmer) and the subsequent death of Kirsten Rolffes (who played Mrs Drusse) in 2000, the likelihood of a third series is now very remote. Von Trier actually wrote the third and final season, but the production was not picked up by DR. At that point, five regular cast members had died and it seemed impossible to continue the series. The abandoned scripts were sent to the producers of Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital, but it is unclear whether they used the scripts or not. Despite being a mini-series, The Kingdom appears as one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Von Trier has credited Twin Peaks and the 1965 French miniseries Belphegor as inspirations. Plot Each episode of Riget and Riget II begins with the same prologue, detailing how the hospital, Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, was built on the site of the \\"bleaching ponds\\", which recur in the name of the street of the hospital's official address, Blegdamsvej, although the exact significance of the reference is never explicitly discussed in the series. The show begins with the admission of a spiritualist patient, Sigrid Drusse, who hears the sound of a girl crying in the elevator shaft. Upon investigation, Drusse discovers that the girl had died decades earlier, having been killed by her father to hide her illegitimacy. In order to put the spirit to rest, Drusse searches for the girl's body and ultimately finds it preserved in a specimen jar in the office of the hospital's professor of pathology, Professor Bondo (Baard Owe). Meanwhile, neurosurgeon Stig Helmer, a recent appointee from Sweden to the neurosurgery department, tries to cover up his responsibility for a botched operation which left a young girl in a persistent vegetative state. Pathologist Dr. Bondo attempts to convince the family of a man dying from liver cancer to donate his liver to the hospital for Bondo's research. (In fact, Bondo wants it as a trophy, as it is the second largest hepatosarcoma ever recorded.) When his request is denied, Bondo has the cancerous liver transplanted into his own body (as the patient signed an organ donor form), so that the cancer will become his personal property and can be kept within the hospital. Amongst other plotlines, a young medical student becomes attracted to the nurse in charge of the sleep research laboratory, a ghostly ambulance appears and disappears every night, a junior doctor runs a black market in medical supplies, and a neurosurgeon discovers that she was impregnated by a ghost and that the baby in her womb is developing abnormally rapidly. In every episode, two dishwashers (each with Down syndrome) in the cellar discuss the strange happenings at Riget, and Stig Helmer screams his famous catchphrase: Danskj√§vlar (subtitled as \\"Danish scum\\", but literally \\"Danish devils\\").

The plot retained many of the elements of Riget, transferring the location of the hospital to Lewiston, Maine and placing it on the site of a mill built before the Civil War. Many of the characters derived their names from the Danish original (e.g., Sigrid Drusse became Sally Druse and Stig Helmer became Dr. Stegman). A significant difference in the American series was the introduction of a talking giant anteater character in the role of spirit guide/death/Anubis/Antubis.

The regulations governing the cars are unique to the championship and specify that cars must be constructed by the racing teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be outsourced.Page 3, 6.3: \\"The obligation to design and use Listed Parts shall not prevent a constructor from outsourcing the design and/or manufacture of any Listed Parts to a third party in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 3 to The 2009 Concorde Agreement.\\"2010 F1 Sporting Regulations ‚Äì published on 19.08.2009 (PDF) Construction  Chassis design Modern-day Formula One cars are constructed from composites of carbon fibre and similar ultra-lightweight materials. The minimum weight permissible is including the driver but not fuel. Cars are weighed with dry-weather tyres fitted. Prior to the 2014 F1 season, cars often weighed in under this limit so teams added ballast in order to add weight to the car. The advantage of using ballast is that it can be placed anywhere in the car to provide ideal weight distribution. This can help lower the car's centre of gravity to improve stability and also allows the team to fine-tune the weight distribution of the car to suit individual circuits. Engines Renault RS26 V8 engine, which powered the 2006 Renault R26 The BMW M12/13, a massively powerful 4-cylinder 1.5-litre turbo that powered the Brabham-BMW cars in the 1980s developed 1400 bhp during qualifying. The Ford Cosworth DFV engine became the de facto power plant for many private teams, as it powered cars winning a record 167 races between 1967 and 1983 and helped win 12 driver titles The BRM H16 engine, tough but not successful was a 16-cylinder 64-valve engine that powered the BRM team The 2006 Formula One season saw the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) introduce a then-new engine formula, which mandated cars to be powered by 2.4-litre naturally aspirated engines in the V8 engine configuration, with no more than four valves per cylinder. Further technical restrictions, such as a ban on variable intake trumpets, have also been introduced with the new 2.4 L V8 formula to prevent the teams from achieving higher RPM and horsepower too quickly. The season limited engines to 18,000 rpm in order to improve engine reliability and cut costs. For a decade, F1 cars had run with 3.0-litre naturally aspirated engines with all teams settling on a V10 layout by the end of the period; however, development had led to these engines producing between , and the cars reaching top speeds of (Jacques Villeneuve with Sauber-Ferrari) on the Monza circuit. Teams started to use exotic alloys in the late 1990s, leading to the FIA banning the use of exotic materials in engine construction, with only aluminium, titanium and iron alloys being allowed for the pistons, cylinders, connecting rods and crankshafts. The FIA has continually enforced material and design restrictions to limit power. Even with the restrictions, the V10s in the 2005 season were reputed to develop , power levels not seen since the ban on turbo-charged engines in 1989. The lesser funded teams (the former Minardi team spends less than 50 million, while Ferrari spent hundreds of millions of euros a year developing their car) had the option of keeping the current V10 for another season, but with a rev limiter to keep them competitive with the most powerful V8 engines. The only team to take this option was the Toro Rosso team, which was the reformed and regrouped Minardi. In 2012, the engines consumed around of air per second (at the 2012 rev limit of 18,000 rpm); race fuel consumption rate was normally around . All cars have the engine located between the driver and the rear axle. The engines are a stressed member in most cars, meaning that the engine is part of the structural support framework, being bolted to the cockpit at the front end, and transmission and rear suspension at the back end. In the 2004 championship, engines were required to last a full race weekend. For the 2005 championship, they were required to last two full race weekends and if a team changes an engine between the two races, they incur a penalty of 10 grid positions. In 2007, this rule was altered slightly and an engine only had to last for Saturday and Sunday running. This was to promote Friday running. In the 2008 season, engines were required to last two full race weekends; the same regulation as the 2006 season. However, for the 2009 season, each driver is allowed to use a maximum of 8 engines over the season, meaning that a couple of engines have to last three race weekends. This method of limiting engine costs also increases the importance of tactics, since the teams have to choose which races to have a new or an already-used engine. As of the 2014 season, all F1 cars have been equipped with turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 engines. Turbochargers had previously been banned since 1989. This change may give an improvement of up to 29% fuel efficiency. One of the many reasons that Mercedes dominated the season early, was due to the placement of the turbocharger's compressor at one side of the engine, and the turbine at the other; both were then linked by a shaft travelling through the vee of the engine. The benefit is that air is not traveling through as much pipework, in turn reducing turbo lag and increases the efficiency of the car. In addition, it means that the air moving through the compressor is much cooler since it is farther away from the hot turbine section. Transmission The gearbox with mounted rear suspension elements from the Lotus T127, Lotus Racing's car for the 2010 season. Formula One cars use highly automated semi-automatic sequential gearboxes with paddle-shifters, with regulations stating that 8 forward gears (increased from 7 from the 2014 season onwards)Quora.com and 1 reverse gear must be used, with rear-wheel-drive. The gearbox is constructed of carbon titanium, as heat dissipation is a critical issue, and is bolted onto the back of the engine. Fully-automatic gearboxes, and systems such as launch control and traction control, are illegal, to keep driver skill important in controlling the car. The driver initiates gear shifts using paddles mounted on the back of the steering wheel and electro-hydraulic actuators perform the actual shift as well as the electronic throttle control. Clutch control is also performed electro-hydraulically, except when launching from a standstill (i.e., stationary, neutral) and into first gear, where the driver operates the clutch manually using a lever mounted on the back of the steering wheel. A modern F1 clutch is a multi-plate carbon design with a diameter of less than , weighing less than and handling around . race season, all teams are using seamless-shift transmissions, which allow almost instantaneous changing of gears with minimum loss of drive. Shift times for Formula One cars are in the region of 0.05 seconds. In order to keep costs low in Formula One, gearboxes must last five consecutive events and since 2015, gearbox ratios will be fixed for each season (for 2014 they could be changed only once). Changing a gearbox before the allowed time will cause a penalty of five places drop on the starting grid for the first event that the new gearbox is used. Aerodynamics The streamlined body of a 1954 Ferrari 553 F1 The 1979 Lotus 80 was designed to take ground effect as far as possible Aerodynamics has become key to success in the sport and teams spend tens of millions of dollars on research and development in the field each year. The aerodynamic designer has two primary concerns: the creation of downforce, to help push the car's tyres onto the track and improve cornering forces; and minimising the drag that gets caused by turbulence and acts to slow the car down. Several teams started to experiment with the now familiar wings in the late 1960s. Racecar wings operate on the same principle as aircraft wings but are configured to cause a downward force rather than an upward one. A modern Formula One car is capable of developing 6 G's of lateral cornering force thanks to aerodynamic downforce. The aerodynamic downforce allowing this is typically greater than the weight of the car. That means that, theoretically, at high speeds, they could drive on the upside-down the surface of a suitable structure; e.g. on the ceiling. The use of aerodynamics to increase the cars' grip was pioneered in Formula One in the season by Lotus, Ferrari and Brabham. At first, Lotus introduced modest front wings and a spoiler on Graham Hill's Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix, then Brabham and Ferrari went one better at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix with full-width wings mounted on struts high above the driver. Early experiments with movable wings and high mountings led to some spectacular accidents, and for the 1970 season, regulations were introduced to limit the size and location of wings. Having evolved over time, similar rules are still used today. In the late 1960s, Jim Hall of Chaparral, first introduced \\"ground effect\\" downforce to auto racing. In the mid-1970s, Lotus engineers found out that the entire car could be made to act like a giant wing by the creation of an airfoil surface on its underside which would cause air moving relative to the car to push it to the road. Applying another idea of Jim Hall's from his Chaparral 2J sports racer, Gordon Murray designed the Brabham BT46B, which used a separately-powered fan system to extract air from the skirted area under the car, creating enormous downforce. After technical challenges from other teams, it was withdrawn after a single race. Rule changes then followed to limit the benefits of 'ground effects' ‚Äì firstly a ban on the skirts used to contain the low-pressure area, later a requirement for a 'stepped floor'. The McLaren MP4-21's rear engine cover designed to direct airflow towards the rear wing Despite the full-sized wind tunnels and vast computing power used by the aerodynamic departments of most teams, the fundamental principles of Formula One aerodynamics still apply: to create the maximum amount of downforce for the minimal amount of drag. The primary wings mounted on the front and rear are fitted with different profiles depending on the downforce requirements of a particular track. Tight, slow circuits like Monaco require very aggressive wing profiles ‚Äì cars run two separate 'blades' of 'elements' on the rear wings (two is the maximum permitted). In contrast, high-speed circuits like Monza see the cars stripped of as much wing as possible, to reduce drag and increase speed on the long straights. Every single surface of a modern Formula One car, from the shape of the suspension links to that of the driver's helmet ‚Äì has its aerodynamic effects considered. Disrupted air, where the flow 'separates' from the body, creates turbulence which creates drag ‚Äì which slows the car down. Almost as much effort has been spent reducing drag as increasing downforce ‚Äì from the vertical end-plates fitted to wings to prevent vortices forming to the diffuser plates mounted low at the back, which helps to re-equalise pressure of the faster-flowing air that has passed under the car and would otherwise create a low-pressure 'balloon' dragging at the back. Despite this, designers can't make their cars too 'slippery', as a good supply of airflow has to be ensured to help dissipate the vast amounts of heat produced by the engine and brakes. A modern-day Ferrari Formula One car being tested by Fernando Alonso at Jerez. The car is the Ferrari F10. In recent years, most Formula One teams have tried to emulate Ferrari's 'narrow waist' design, where the rear of the car is made as narrow and low as possible. This reduces drag and maximises the amount of air available to the rear wing. The 'barge boards' fitted to the sides of cars have also helped to shape the flow of the air and minimise the amount of turbulence. Revised regulations introduced in 2005 forced the aerodynamicists to be even more ingenious. In a bid to cut speeds, the FIA reduced downforce by raising the front wing, bringing the rear wing forward, and modifying the rear diffuser profile. The designers quickly regained much of this loss, with a variety of intricate and novel solutions such as the 'horn' winglets first seen on the McLaren MP4-20. Most of those innovations were effectively outlawed under even more stringent aero regulations imposed by the FIA for 2009. The changes were designed to promote overtaking by making it easier for a car to closely follow another. The new rules took the cars into another new era, with lower and wider front wings, taller and narrower rear wings, and generally much 'cleaner' bodywork. Perhaps the most interesting change, however, was the introduction of 'moveable aerodynamics', with the driver able to make limited adjustments to the front wing from the cockpit during a race. That was usurped for 2011 by the new DRS (Drag Reduction System) rear wing system. This too allows drivers to make adjustments, but the system's availability is electronically governed ‚Äì originally it could be used at any time in practice and qualifying (unless a driver is on wet-weather tyres), but during the race, it could only be activated when a driver is less than one second behind another car at pre-determined points on the track. (From 2013 DRS is available only at the pre-determined points during all sessions). The system is then deactivated once the driver brakes. The system \\"stalls\\" the rear wing by opening a flap, which leaves a 50 mm horizontal gap in the wing, thus massively reducing drag and allowing higher top speeds. However, this also reduces downforce so it is normally used on long straight track sections or sections which do not require high downforce. The system was introduced to promote more overtaking and is often the reason for overtaking on straights or at the end of straights where overtaking is encouraged in the following corner(s). However, the reception of the DRS system has differed among drivers, fans, and specialists. Returning Formula 1 driver Robert Kubica has been quoted of saying he \\"has not seen any overtaking moves in Formula 1 for two years\\", suggesting that the DRS is an unnatural way to pass cars on the track as it does not actually require driver skill to successfully overtake a competitor, therefore, it would not be overtaking. The rear wing of a modern Formula One car, with three aerodynamic elements (1, 2, 3). The rows of holes for adjustment of the angle of attack (4) and installation of another element (5) are visible on the wing's endplate. Wings Matra Cosworth MS80. By the end of the 1960s wings had become a standard feature in all Formula cars Early designs linked wings directly to the suspension, but several accidents led to rules stating that wings must be fixed rigidly to the chassis. The cars' aerodynamics are designed to provide maximum downforce with a minimum of drag; every part of the bodywork is designed with this aim in mind. Like most open-wheel cars they feature large front and rear aerofoils, but they are far more developed than American open-wheel racers, which depend more on suspension tuning; for instance, the nose is raised above the centre of the front aerofoil, allowing its entire width to provide downforce. The front and rear wings are highly sculpted and extremely fine 'tuned', along with the rest of the body such as the turning vanes beneath the nose, bargeboards, sidepods, underbody, and the rear diffuser. They also feature aerodynamic appendages that direct the airflow. Such an extreme level of aerodynamic development means that an F1 car produces much more downforce than any other open-wheel formula; Indycars, for example, produce downforce equal to their weight (that is, a downforce:weight ratio of 1:1) at , while an F1 car achieves the same at , and at the ratio is roughly 2:1. A low downforce spec. front wing on the Renault R30 F1 car. Front wings heavily influence the cornering speed and handling of a car, and are regularly changed depending on the downforce requirements of a circuit. The bargeboards, in particular, are designed, shaped, configured, adjusted, and positioned not to create downforce directly, as with a conventional wing or underbody venturi, but to create vortices from the air spillage at their edges. The use of vortices is a significant feature of the latest breeds of F1 cars. Since a vortex is a rotating fluid that creates a low-pressure zone at its centre, creating vortices lowers the overall local pressure of the air. Since low pressure is what is desired under the car, as it allows normal atmospheric pressure to press the car down from the top; by creating vortices, downforce can be augmented while still staying within the rules prohibiting ground effects. The F1 cars for the 2009 season came under much questioning due to the design of the rear diffusers of the Williams, Toyota and the Brawn GP cars raced by Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello, dubbed double diffusers. Appeals from many of the teams were heard by the FIA, which met in Paris, before the 2009 Chinese Grand Prix, and the use of such diffusers was declared as legal. Brawn GP boss Ross Brawn claimed the double diffuser design as \\"an innovative approach of an existing idea\\". These were subsequently banned for the 2011 season. Another controversy of the 2010 and '11 seasons was the front wing of the Red Bull cars. Several teams protested claiming the wing was breaking regulations. Footage from high- speed sections of circuits showed the Red Bull front wing bending on the outsides subsequently creating greater downforce. Tests were held on the Red Bull front wing and the FIA could find no way that the wing was breaking any regulation. Since the start of the 2011 season, cars have been allowed to run with an adjustable rear wing, more commonly known as DRS (drag reduction system), a system to combat the problem of turbulent air when overtaking. On the straights of a track, drivers can deploy DRS, which opens the rear wing, reduces the drag of the car, allowing it to move faster. As soon as the driver touches the brake, the rear wing shuts again. In free practice and qualifying, a driver may use it whenever he wishes to, but in the race, it can only be used if the driver is 1 second, or less, behind another driver at the DRS detection zone on the race track, at which point it can be activated in the activation zone until the driver brakes. Nose Box Nose box or more commonly the Nose cones serve three main purposes: 1) They are the structures on which the front wings are mounted. 2) They channelise the airflow to the bottom of the car toward the diffuser. 3) They act as shock absorbers in case of accidents. Nose boxes are hollow structures made of carbon fibers. They absorb the shock at the time of crash preventing injury to the driver. Air Box Just behind the driver's cockpit is a structure called the Air Box. The AirBox serves two purposes. It receives the high speed moving air and supplies to the intake manifold of the engine. This high-speed air is pressurised and hence is compressed due to the Ram Effect. This high-pressure air, when supplied to the engine, boosts its power considerably. Also, the air supplied to it is highly turbulent since it passes above the driver's helmet. The airbox absorbs this turbulent air, preventing it from disturbing the laminar airflow along with other parts. The second advantage of the air box is its large size, which provides a large space for advertising, in turn, providing opportunities for additional ad revenue. Ground effect A rear diffuser on a 2009 Renault R29. Rear diffusers have been an important aerodynamic aid since the late 1980s F1 regulations heavily limit the use of ground effect aerodynamics which are a highly efficient means of creating downforce with a small drag penalty. The underside of the vehicle, the undertray, must be flat between the axles. A 10 mm thick wooden plank or skid block runs down the middle of the car to prevent the cars from running low enough to contact the track surface; this skid block is measured before and after a race. Should the plank be less than 9 mm thick after the race, the car is disqualified. A substantial amount of downforce is provided by using a rear diffuser which rises from the undertray at the rear axle to the actual rear of the bodywork. The limitations on ground effects, limited size of the wings (requiring use at high angles of attack to create sufficient downforce), and vortices created by open wheels lead to a high aerodynamic drag coefficient (about 1 according to Minardi's technical director Gabriele Tredozi; compare with the average modern saloon car, which has a Cd value between 0.25 and 0.35), so that, despite the enormous power output of the engines, the top speed of these cars is less than that of World War II vintage Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union Silver Arrows racers. However, this drag is more than compensated for by the ability to corner at extremely high speed. The aerodynamics are adjusted for each track; with a low drag configuration for tracks where high speed is more important like Autodromo Nazionale Monza, and a high traction configuration for tracks where cornering is more important, like the Circuit de Monaco. Regulations The front wing is lower than ever before, as seen on the 2012 Mercedes F1 W03 2009 cars having smoother bodywork, as shown on this Williams FW31 With the 2009 regulations, the FIA rid F1 cars of small winglets and other parts of the car (minus the front and rear wing) used to manipulate the airflow of the car in order to decrease drag and increase downforce. As it is now, the front wing is shaped specifically to push air towards all the winglets and bargeboards so that the airflow is smooth. Should these be removed, various parts of the car will cause great drag when the front wing is unable to shape the air past the body of the car. The regulations which came into effect in 2009 have reduced the width of the rear wing by 25 cm, and standardised the centre section of the front wing to prevent teams from developing the front wing. Steering wheel A 2012 Lotus F1 wheel, with a complex array of dials, knobs, and buttons. The driver has the ability to fine-tune many elements of the race car from within the machine using the steering wheel. The wheel can be used to change gears, apply rev. limiter, adjust fuel/air mix, change brake pressure, and call the radio. Data such as engine rpm, lap times, speed, and gear are displayed on an LCD screen. The wheel hub will also incorporate gear change paddles and a row of LED shift lights. The wheel alone can cost about $50,000, and with carbon fibre construction, weighs in at 1.3 kilograms. In the 2014 season, certain teams such as Mercedes have chosen to use larger LCDs on their wheels which allow the driver to see additional information such as fuel flow and torque delivery. They are also more customizable owing to the possibility of using much different software. Fuel Crash resistant fuel bladders, reinforced with such fibers as Kevlar, are mandatory on Formula One cars. The fuel used in F1 cars is fairly similar to ordinary (premium) petrol, albeit with a far more tightly controlled mix. Formula One fuel would fall under high octane premium road fuel with octane thresholds of 95 to 102. In contrast to Nascar running renewable bio-fuel E-85. E-85 is corn-based ethanol fuel blend of 85% corn ethanol fuel and 15% gasoline or another hydrocarbon by volume with up to 85% corn-based Ethanol with high octane rating up to 108 octane. E-85 is a road-going fuel in the United States used in a modern road-going flex-fuel vehicles. F1 Blends are tuned for maximum performance in given weather conditions or different circuits. During the period when teams were limited to a specific volume of fuel during a race, exotic high-density fuel blends were used which were actually more dense than water, since the energy content of a fuel depends on its mass density. To make sure that the teams and fuel suppliers are not violating the fuel regulations, the FIA requires Elf, Shell, Mobil, Petronas, and the other fuel teams to submit a sample of the fuel they are providing for a race. At any time, FIA inspectors can request a sample from the fueling rig to compare the \\"fingerprint\\" of what is in the car during the race with what was submitted. The teams usually abide by this rule, but in 1997, Mika H√§kkinen was stripped of his third-place finish at Spa- Francorchamps in Belgium after the FIA determined that his fuel was not the correct formula, as well as in 1976, both McLaren and Penske cars were forced to the rear of the Italian Grand Prix after the octane number of the mixture was found to be too high. Tyres Bridgestone Potenza F1 front tyre The 2009 season saw the re-introduction of slick tyres replacing the grooved tyres used from 1998 to 2008. Tyres can be no wider than at the rear, front tyre width expanded from 245 mm to 305 mm for the 2017 season. Unlike the fuel, the tyres bear only a superficial resemblance to a normal road tyre. Whereas a road car tyre has a useful life of up to , a Formula One tyre does not even last the whole race distance (a little over ); they are usually changed one or two times per race, depending on the track. This is the result of a drive to maximize the road-holding ability, leading to the use of very soft compounds (to ensure that the tyre surface conforms to the road surface as closely as possible). Since the start of the 2007 season, F1 had a sole tyre supplier. From 2007 to 2010, this was Bridgestone, but 2011 saw the reintroduction of Pirelli into the sport, following the departure of Bridgestone. Seven compounds of F1 tyre exist; 5 are dry weather compounds (labeled C1 through C5) while 2 are wet compounds (intermediates for damp surfaces with no standing water and full wets for surfaces with standing water). Three of the dry weather compounds (generally a harder and softer compound) are brought to each race, plus both wet weather compounds. The harder tyres are more durable but give less grip, and the softer tyres the opposite. In 2009, the slick tyres returned as a part of revisions to the rules for the 2009 season; slicks have no grooves and give up to 18% more contact with the track. In the Bridgestone years, a green band on the sidewall of the softer compound was painted to allow spectators to distinguish which tyre a driver is on. Beginning in 2019, Pirelli scrapped the tyre naming system such that the tyres will denote at each Grand Prix independently as hard, medium and soft with white, yellow and red sidewalls respectively rather than having a separate name and colour for each of the five tyres. The change was implemented so that casual fans could better understand the tyre system. Generally, the three dry compounds brought to the track are of consecutive specifications. Brakes Brake discs on the Mercedes MGP W02. Disc brakes consist of a rotor and caliper at each wheel. Carbon composite rotors (introduced by the Brabham team in 1976) are used instead of steel or cast iron because of their superior frictional, thermal, and anti-warping properties, as well as significant weight savings. These brakes are designed and manufactured to work in extreme temperatures, up to 1,000 degrees Celsius (1800 ¬∞F). The driver can control brake force distribution fore and aft to compensate for changes in track conditions or fuel load. Regulations specify this control must be mechanical, not electronic, thus it is typically operated by a lever inside the cockpit as opposed to a control on the steering wheel. An average F1 car can decelerate from 100 to 0 km/h (62 to 0 mph) in about 15 meters (48 ft), compared with a 2009 BMW M3, which needs 31 meters (102 ft). When braking from higher speeds, aerodynamic downforce enables tremendous deceleration: 4.5 G's to 5.0 G's (44 to 49 m/s2), and up to 5.5 G's (54 m/s2) at the high-speed circuits such as the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve (Canadian GP) and the Autodromo Nazionale Monza (Italian GP). This contrasts with 1.0 G's to 1.5 G's (10 to 15 m/s2) for the best sports cars (the Bugatti Veyron is claimed to be able to brake at 1.3 g). An F1 car can brake from 200 km/h (124 mph) to a complete stop in just 2.9 seconds, using only 65 metres (213 ft).F1Technical.com web site. Retrieved 21 July 2007. Performance Every F1 car on the grid is capable of going from and back to 0 in less than five seconds. During a demonstration at the Silverstone circuit in Britain, an F1 McLaren-Mercedes car driven by David Coulthard gave a pair of Mercedes-Benz street cars a head start of seventy seconds, and was able to beat the cars to the finish line from a standing start, a distance of only . As well as being fast in a straight line, F1 cars have outstanding cornering ability. Grand Prix cars can negotiate corners at significantly higher speeds than other racing cars because of the intense levels of grip and downforce. Cornering speed is so high that Formula One drivers have strength training routines just for the neck muscles. Former F1 driver Juan Pablo Montoya claimed to be able to perform 300 repetitions of with his neck. The combination of light weight (642 kg in race trim for 2013), power with the 3.0 L V10, with the 2007 regulation 2.4 L V8, with 2016 1.6 L V6 turbo), aerodynamics, and ultra-high-performance tyres is what gives the F1 car its high performance figures. The principal consideration for F1 designers is acceleration, and not simply top speed. Three types of acceleration can be considered to assess a car's performance: * Longitudinal acceleration (speeding up) * Longitudinal deceleration (braking) * Lateral acceleration (turning) All three accelerations should be maximised. The way these three accelerations are obtained and their values are: Acceleration The 2016 F1 cars have a power-to-weight ratio of 1,400 hp/t (1.05 kW/kg; 1,270 hp/U.S. ton; 0.635 hp/lb). Theoretically this would allow the car to reach in less than 1 second. However the massive power cannot be converted to motion at low speeds due to traction loss and the usual figure is 2.5 seconds to reach . After about traction loss is minimal due to the combined effect of the car moving faster and the downforce, hence continuing to accelerate the car at a very high rate. The figures are (for the 2016 Mercedes W07): *0 to : 2.4 seconds *0 to : 4.4 seconds *0 to : 8.4 seconds The acceleration figure is usually 1.45 G's (14.2 m/s2) up to , which means the driver is pushed by the seat with a force whose acceleration is 1.45 times that of Earth's gravity. There are also boost systems known as kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS). These devices recover the kinetic energy created by the car's braking process. They store that energy and convert it into power that can be called upon to boost acceleration. KERS typically adds and weighs . There are principally two types of systems: electrical and mechanical flywheel. Electrical systems use a motor-generator incorporated in the car's transmission which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Once the energy has been harnessed, it is stored in a battery and released at will. Mechanical systems capture braking energy and use it to turn a small flywheel which can spin at up to 80,000 rpm. When extra power is required, the flywheel is connected to the car's rear wheels. In contrast to electrical KERS, mechanical energy does not change state and is, therefore, more efficient. There is one other option available, hydraulic KERS, where braking energy is used to accumulate hydraulic pressure which is then sent to the wheels when required. Deceleration The carbon brakes on a Sauber C30 The carbon brakes in combination with tyre technology and the car's aerodynamics produce truly remarkable braking forces. The deceleration force under braking is usually 4 Gs (39 m/s2), and can be as high as 5‚Äì6 Gs when braking from extreme speeds, for instance at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit or at Indianapolis. In 2007, Martin Brundle, a former Grand Prix driver, tested the Williams Toyota FW29 Formula 1 car and stated that under heavy braking he felt like his lungs were hitting the inside of his ribcage, forcing him to exhale involuntarily. Here the aerodynamic drag actually helps, and can contribute as much as 1.0 Gs of braking, which is the equivalent of the brakes on most road sports cars. In other words, if the throttle is let go, the F1 car will slow down under drag at the same rate as most sports cars do with braking, at least at speeds above . There are three companies that manufacture brakes for Formula One. They are Hitco (based in the US, part of the SGL Carbon Group), Brembo in Italy, and Carbone Industrie of France. Whilst Hitco manufactures their own carbon/carbon, Brembo sources theirs from Honeywell, and Carbone Industrie purchases their carbon from Messier Bugatti. Carbon/carbon is a short name for carbon fibre reinforced carbon. This means carbon fibres strengthening a matrix of carbon, which is added to the fibres by way of matrix deposition (CVI or CVD) or by pyrolysis of a resin binder. F1 brakes are in diameter and a maximum of thick. The carbon/carbon brake pads are actuated by 6-piston opposed callipers provided by Akebono, AP Racing or Brembo. The callipers are aluminium alloy-bodied with titanium pistons. The regulations limit the modulus of the calliper material to 80 GPa in order to prevent teams using exotic, high specific stiffness materials, for example, beryllium. Titanium pistons save weight, and also have a low thermal conductivity, reducing the heat flow into the brake fluid. Lateral acceleration The aerodynamic forces of a Formula 1 car can produce as much as three times the car's weight in downforce. In fact, at a speed of just , the downforce is equal in magnitude to the weight of the car. At low speeds, the car can turn at 2.0 G's. At already the lateral force is 3.0 G's, as evidenced by the famous esses (turns 3 and 4) at the Suzuka circuit. Higher-speed corners such as Blanchimont (Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps) and Copse (Silverstone Circuit) are taken at above 5.0 G's, and 6.0 G's has been recorded at Suzuka's 130-R corner. This contrasts with a maximum for high performance road cars such as Enzo Ferrari of 1.5 G's or Koenigsegg One:1 of above 1.7 G's for the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. Since the force that creates the lateral acceleration is largely friction, and friction is proportional to the normal force applied, the large downforce allows an F1 car to corner at very high speeds. As an example of the extreme cornering speeds; the Blanchimont and Eau Rouge corners at Spa-Francorchamps are taken flat-out at above , whereas the race-spec touring cars can only do so at 150‚Äì160 km/h (note that lateral force increases with the square of the speed). A newer and perhaps even more extreme example is the Turn 8 at the Istanbul Park circuit, a 190¬∞ relatively tight 4-apex corner, in which the cars maintain speeds between (in 2006) and experience between 4.5 G's and 5.5 G's for 7 seconds‚Äîthe longest sustained hard cornering in Formula 1. Top speeds BAR-Honda set an unofficial speed record of 413 km/h (257 mph) at Bonneville Speedway Top speeds are in practice limited by the longest straight at the track and by the need to balance the car's aerodynamic configuration between high straight-line speed (low aerodynamic drag) and high cornering speed (high downforce) to achieve the fastest lap time.The importance of aerodynamics www.f1technical.net. Retrieved 26 January 2007. During the 2006 season, the top speeds of Formula 1 cars were a little over 300 km/h (185 mph) at high-downforce tracks such as Albert Park, Australia and Sepang, Malaysia. These speeds were down by some from the 2005 speeds, and from the 2004 speeds, due to the recent performance restrictions (see below). On low-downforce circuits greater top speeds were registered: at Gilles-Villeneuve (Canada) 325 km/h (203 mph), at Indianapolis (USA) 335 km/h (210 mph), and at Monza (Italy) 360 km/h (225 mph). In testing one month prior to the 2005 Italian Grand Prix, Juan Pablo Montoya of the McLaren-Mercedes F1 team recorded a record top speed of 372.6 km/h (231.5 mph), which got officially recognised by the FIA as the fastest speed ever achieved by an F1 car, even though it was not set during an officially sanctioned session during a race weekend. In the 2005 Italian GP Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen of McLaren-Mercedes was recorded at 370.1 km/h (229.9 mph). This record was broken at the 2016 Mexican Grand Prix by Williams driver Valtteri Bottas, whose top speed in race conditions was 372.54 km/h (231.48 mph).http://www.fia.com/file/49841/download?token=pw7Swwc6 However, even though this information was shown in FIA's official monitors, the FIA is yet to accept it as an official record. Bottas had previously set an even higher record top speed during qualifying for the 2016 European Grand Prix, recording a speed of 378.035 km/h (234.9 mph), albeit through the use of slipstream drafting. This top speed is yet to be confirmed by any official method as currently the only source of this information is the Williams team's Twitter post, while the FIA's official speed trap data measured Bottas's speed at 366.1 km/h in that instance.http://www.fia.com/file/43509/download?token=kBFi7F0I At the moment Montoya's speed of is still regarded as the official record, even though it was not set during a sanctioned session. Away from the track, the BAR Honda team used a modified BAR 007 car, which they claim complied with FIA Formula One regulation, to set an unofficial speed record of 413 km/h (257 mph) on a one way straight-line run on 6 November 2005 during a shakedown ahead of their Bonneville 400 record attempt. The car was optimised for top speed with only enough downforce to prevent it from leaving the ground. The car, badged as a Honda following their takeover of BAR at the end of 2005, set an FIA ratified record of on a one way run on 21 July 2006 at Bonneville Speedway.News: 'FIA ratify Honda Racing F1 Team's Bonneville records' (15 November 2006) and 'Bonneville team crack 400 in Mojave' (6 November 2005) 'Bonneville 400' .

In an effort to reduce speeds and increase driver safety, the FIA has continuously introduced new rules for F1 constructors since the 1980s. A wider 1979 McLaren M28 A much narrower 2011 Red Bull RB7 These rules have included the banning of such ideas as the \\"wing car\\" (ground effect) in 1983; the turbocharger in 1989 (these were reintroduced for 2014); active suspension and ABS in 1994; slick tyres (these were reintroduced for 2009); smaller front and rear wings and a reduction in engine capacity from 3.5 to 3.0 litres in 1995; reducing the width of the cars from over 2 metres to around 1.8 metres in 1998; again a reduction in engine capacity from 3.0 to 2.4 litres in 2006; traction control in 1994, and again in 2008 alongside launch control and engine braking after electronic aids were reintroduced in 2001. Yet despite these changes, constructors continued to extract performance gains by increasing power and aerodynamic efficiency. As a result, the pole position speed at many circuits in comparable weather conditions dropped between 1.5 and 3 seconds in 2004 over the prior year's times. The aerodynamic restrictions introduced in 2005 were meant to reduce downforce by about 30%, however, most teams were able to successfully reduce this to a mere 5 to 10% downforce loss. In 2006 the engine power was reduced from by shifting from the 3.0L V10s, used for over a decade, to 2.4L V8s. Some of these new engines were capable of achieving 20,000 rpm during 2006, though for the 2007 season engine development was frozen and the FIA limited all engines to 19,000 rpm to increase reliability and control at increasing engine speeds. In 2008, the FIA further strengthened its cost-cutting measures by stating that gearboxes are to last for 4 Grand Prix weekends, in addition to the 2 race weekend engine rule. Furthermore, all teams were required to use a standardised ECU supplied by MES (McLaren Electronic Systems) made in conjunction with Microsoft. These ECUs have placed restrictions on the use of electronic driver aids such as traction control, launch control, and engine braking and are tagged to prevent modification. The emphasis is on reducing costs as well as placing the focus back onto driver skills as opposed to the so-called 'electronic gizmos' mainly controlling the cars. Changes were made for the 2009 season to increase dependency on mechanical grip and create overtaking opportunities ‚Äì resulting in the return to slick tyres, a wider and lower front wing with a standardized centre section, a narrower and taller rear wing, and the diffuser being moved backward and made taller yet less efficient at producing downforce. The overall aerodynamic grip was dramatically reduced with the banning of complex appendages such as winglets, bargeboards and other aero devices previously used to better direct airflow over and under the cars. The maximum engine speed was reduced to 18,000 rpm to increase reliability further and conform to engine life demand. A 2010 Sauber C29 Due to increasing environmental pressures from lobby groups and the like, many have called into question the relevance of Formula 1 as an innovating force towards future technological advances (particularly those concerned with efficient cars). The FIA has been asked to consider how it can persuade the sport to move down a more environmentally friendly path. Therefore, in addition to the above changes outlined for the 2009 season, teams were invited to construct a KERS device, encompassing certain types of regenerative braking systems to be fitted to the cars in time for the 2009 season. The system aims to reduce the amount of kinetic energy converted to waste heat in braking, converting it instead to a useful form (such as electrical energy or energy in a flywheel) to be later fed back through the engine to create a power boost. However, unlike road car systems that automatically store and release energy, the energy is only released when the driver presses a button and is useful for up to 6.5 seconds, giving an additional and 400 kJ. It effectively mimics the 'push to pass' button from IndyCar and A1GP series. KERS was not seen in the 2010 championship ‚Äì while it was not technically banned, the FOTA collectively agreed not to use it. It however made a return for the 2011 season, with all teams except HRT, Virgin and Lotus utilizing the device. The regulations for the 2014 season limit the maximum fuel mass flow to the engine to 100 kg/h, which reduces the maximum power output from the current 550 kW to about 450 kW. The rules also double the power limit of the electric motor to 120 kW for both acceleration and energy recovery, and increase the maximum amount of energy the KERS is allowed to use to 4 MJ per lap, with charging limited to 2 MJ per lap. An additional electric motor-generator unit may be connected to the turbocharger.

He served as the deputy assistant to President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1973. He revealed the existence of the White House taping system on July 13, 1973, during the Watergate investigation, but had no involvement in the scandal. From 1973 to 1975, he served as administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. Early life and Air Force career Butterfield was born April 6, 1926, in Pensacola, Florida, to Susan Armistead Alexander Butterfield and United States Navy pilot (later rear admiral) Horace B. Butterfield. He grew up in Coronado, California, and left home in 1943. Butterfield enrolled in college at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he became a friend of H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. He left the university to join the United States Air Force in 1948. Initially, Butterfield was stationed at Las Vegas Air Force Base (now Nellis Air Force Base) as a fighter-gunnery instructor before being transferred to the 86th Fighter Wing in Munich, West Germany, in November 1951, where he was a member of the Sky Blazers jet fighter acrobatic team. He later served as the operations officer of a fighter-interceptor squadron in Knoxville, Tennessee, before being promoted to commander of a fighter squadron at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. During the Vietnam War, Butterfield commanded a squadron of low and medium-level combat tactical air reconnaissance aircraft. He flew 98 combat missions, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1965 and 1966, Butterfield served as the military assistant to the special assistant to the Secretary of Defense, where he became a friend of Alexander Haig. He also gained extensive experience working at the White House, where he spent half his time. He advanced to the rank of colonel, and beginning in 1967, was serving in Australia as the F-111 project officer; representative for the commander-in-chief of the Pacific forces; and senior U.S. military representative. During his military career, he attended the National War College, and earned a bachelor of science degree from the University of Maryland (1956) and a master of science degree from George Washington University (1967). White House assistant Obtaining a position In late 1968, Butterfield learned that he would be stationed in Australia for another two years, which would delay any potential promotion and, potentially, harm his military career. The ambitious Butterfield wanted to be in \\"the smoke\\" (where the action was), and wanted to leave Australia. After coming across a newspaper article which mentioned the appointment of H. R. Haldeman as Nixon's White House Chief of Staff, Butterfield wrote to Haldeman asking for a job. The two met in New York City about December 19, 1968, to discuss a role as a military aide, but when nothing suitable came up, Butterfield asked to take any job in the White House. General Andrew Goodpaster, former White House staff secretary in the Eisenhower administration, suggested that Haldeman have a deputy, and Haldeman offered the position to Butterfield about January 13. Butterfield retired from the Air Force a few days later, and his appointment as deputy assistant to the president was announced on January 23, 1969. Role as deputy assistant As deputy assistant to the president, Butterfield was Haldeman's chief assistant. His first few days in the White House were difficult. Butterfield did not meet the president for 13 days. When Haldeman finally introduced Butterfield to Nixon, their meeting was short and awkward. Haldeman then left for California, leaving Butterfield in charge of the White House staff for four days. During the second meeting with Butterfield, Nixon was rude and condescending, and Butterfield nearly resigned. The following day, however, Nixon was cordial and witty, and Butterfield resolved to stay at the White House. Butterfield, who came to like Nixon immensely, nevertheless, felt the president was an \\"ignorant boor, a bumpkin\\". Initially, when meeting with Nixon, Butterfield had to mimic Haldeman's mannerisms and to duplicate his managerial style. Everything Haldeman and Butterfield did was designed to make Nixon feel comfortable and relaxed, never surprised or \\"spooked\\". \\"If you don't do things exactly as I do, it could upset [Nixon],\\" Haldeman told him. Next to Haldeman, Butterfield was the most powerful aide in the White House. He met with Nixon and Haldeman every day at 2 P.M. to plan the following day's activities. He \\"completely controlled\\" what paperwork Nixon saw, and logged memos. He accompanied Haldeman on all domestic trips, co-supervised traveling White House staff with Haldeman, and ran the White House when Haldeman and Nixon went on foreign trips. Every meeting the president attended required \\"talking points\\" for Nixon written by an appropriate staff person as well as an after- meeting summary by that person, and Butterfield oversaw the process by which both documents were completed and filed. Butterfield also oversaw all FBI investigations requested by the White House, which included routine background checks of potential employees as well as politically motivated investigations. Other than Haldeman, no one had a more intimate knowledge of Nixon's working style, the daily operations of the White House, what Nixon may have read, or who Nixon may have met. Butterfield was also the person who primarily managed people as they met with Nixon. This included ensuring people arrived on time, and that they did not stay too long. Butterfield also oversaw Nixon's often- distant relationship with his wife, Pat. Late in 1970, the president's aides lost confidence in Constance C. Stuart, Pat Nixon's staff director and press secretary, and Butterfield was assigned responsibility for overseeing the First Lady's events and publicity. The day after the 1972 presidential election, Pat Nixon confronted her husband over what she perceived to be Oval Office interference with her staff. The deputy assistant to the president, Dwight Chapin, and later Butterfield, were appointed to act as liaison between the two staffs. Installing the taping system Butterfield also oversaw installation of the taping system which Nixon ordered for the White House. On February 10, 1971, Haldeman's assistant, Lawrence Higby, told Butterfield that Nixon wanted a voice-activated audio taping system installed in the Oval Office and on White House telephones. The goal, Nixon said, was to create a more accurate record of events. Butterfield worked with the Secret Service to install five hidden microphones in Nixon's desk in the Oval Office, two in lamps on the mantel over the fireplace, two in the cabinet room, and on all telephone lines in the Lincoln Sitting Room and Oval Office. According to Butterfield, the system was highly secret, its existence known only to Nixon, Haldeman, Higby, and the three or four Secret Service technical staffers who installed it. In April 1971, Nixon ordered the taping system installed in his private office in the Executive Office Building. Revelation of the taping system In March 1973, Butterfield was confirmed as administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, and left the White House. Speculation about a taping system John Dean testified in June 1973 that Nixon was deeply involved in the Watergate cover-up, and mentioned that he suspected White House conversations were taped. Staff of the United States Senate Watergate Committee thereafter began to routinely ask witnesses appearing before the committee if they knew of any taping system. Senate Watergate Committee staff then asked the White House for a list of dates on which the President had met with Dean. About June 20 or 21, Special White House Counsel for Watergate J. Fred Buzhardt provided the committee's Chief Minority (Republican) Counsel, Fred Thompson, with a document intended to impugn Dean's testimony. Buzhardt's document included almost verbatim quotations from meetings Nixon had with Dean. Thompson initially violated an agreement under which the majority and minority staff would share all information. When committee Majority Investigator Scott Armstrong obtained the document, he realized it indicated the existence of a taping system. July 13 questioning Tape recorder from President Nixon's office. Butterfield was questioned by Senate Watergate Committee staff Scott Armstrong, G. Eugene Boyce, Marianne Brazer, and Donald Sanders (deputy minority counsel) on Friday, July 13, 1973, in a background interview prior to his public testimony before the full committee. Butterfield was brought before the committee because he was Haldeman's top deputy and was the only person other than Haldeman who knew as much about the president's day-to-day behavior. The critical line of questioning was conducted by Donald Sanders. Armstrong had given a copy of Buzhardt's report to Butterfield; now Sanders asked if the quotations in it might have come from notes. Butterfield said no, that the quotations were too detailed. In addition, Butterfield said that neither staff nor the president kept notes of one-on-one private meetings with Nixon. When asked where the quotations might have come from, Butterfield said he did not know. Then Sanders asked if there was any validity to John Dean's hypothesis that the White House had taped conversations in the Oval Office. Butterfield replied, \\"I was wondering if someone would ask that. There is tape in the Oval Office.\\" Butterfield then told the investigators that, while he had hoped that no one would ask about the taping system, he had previously decided he would disclose its existence if asked a direct question. Butterfield then testified extensively about when the taping system was installed and how it worked, and told the staff members, \\"Everything was taped ... as long as the President was in attendance. There was not so much as a hint that something should not be taped.\\" Butterfield later said that he assumed the committee knew about the taping system, since they had already interviewed Haldeman and Higby. All present recognized the significance of this disclosure, and, as former political adviser to President Gerald Ford, James M. Cannon put it, \\"Watergate was transformed\\". Butterfield's testimony lasted from 2 PM to 6:30 PM. The four investigators swore themselves to secrecy, and agreed to tell only the Chief Counsel and Chief Minority Counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee. Chief Counsel Samuel Dash says he immediately informed his subordinate, Deputy Chief Counsel Rufus L. Edmisten, and then Democratic Senator Sam Ervin, chairman of the committee. Both Ervin and Dash realized how important it was politically to have had a Republican uncover the taping system. That same night, Ervin asked Dash to have Butterfield testify on Monday, July 16. July 16 questioning Left to right: Fred Thompson, Sen. Howard Baker, and Sen. Sam Ervin during the Senate Watergate Committee hearings Friday night, Thompson informed Senator Howard Baker, the ranking minority member on the Senate Watergate Committee, of Butterfield's admission. After Ervin had told him the news as well, Baker began pushing to have Butterfield testify immediately. Again breaking rules not to have private conversations or meetings with the White House, Thompson also informed Buzhardt about Butterfield's Friday night interview. Butterfield, scheduled to fly to Moscow on July 17 for a trade meeting, was worried that he would be called to testify before the Senate Watergate Committee and that this would force him to cancel his Russia trip. Sources vary as to the next sequence of events. According to some sources, Butterfield was notified on the morning of Sunday, July 15, that he would testify the next day. Butterfield then met with Baker (whom he knew slightly). Butterfield asked Baker to use his influence to cancel the testimony, but Baker declined. Butterfield then called the White House and left a message for Special Counsel Leonard Garment (Dean's replacement), advising him of the content of his Friday testimony and the committee's subpoena for him to testify on Monday. Haig and Buzhardt received Butterfield's message, and waited for Garment to return from a cross-country trip later that day. After Garment was informed, the White House staff did nothing. Butterfield was not contacted, and Nixon was not told about Butterfield's testimony until either Monday morning or late Monday afternoon. According to Butterfield and other sources, Butterfield left a message about his Friday interview for Garment at the White House on Saturday night. He then met with Baker Sunday morning, but Baker told him the chances were slim that he would be called to testify. According to Butterfield, he did not learn that he was going to testify before the Ervin committee until shortly after 10 AM on Monday, July 16, just about three hours before he was due to appear at 2 PM. Butterfield's July 16 testimony, which lasted just 30 minutes, was carried on live television by all the major broadcast networks. Senator Baker informed Dash before the hearing began that, since a Republican (Sanders) had elicited the testimony from Butterfield on July 13, he wanted Republican Chief Minority Counsel Thompson to question Butterfield during the hearing. Baker did not want the Republicans to look as if they had been caught by surprise. The New York Times called Butterfield's testimony \\"dramatic\\", and historian William Doyle has noted that it \\"electrified Washington and triggered a constitutional crisis\\". Political scientist Keith Olson said Butterfield's testimony \\"fundamentally altered the entire Watergate investigation.\\" Within hours of Butterfield's testimony, Haig had the taping system removed. Post- Watergate Butterfield at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in 2016 Watergate revelations Butterfield was not involved in the Watergate cover-up and was never charged with any crime. Butterfield did, however, play a minor role in Watergate. Nixon had $1.6 million in campaign funds left over from the 1968 election. Determined to raise as much re-election money as he could before a new federal campaign finance law took effect on April 7, 1972, Nixon's staff and political operatives began raising large amounts of cash. Some of this cash was used for illegal purposes connected with the Watergate scandal, such as surveillance and paying for the Watergate burglary. Haldeman retained $350,000 in cash in a locked briefcase in the office of Hugh W. Sloan Jr. at the Committee for the Re-Election of the President. Haldeman said the case, colloquially known as \\"the 350\\", was for polling operations. Haldeman aide Gordon C. Strachan moved the cash to the White House in April 1972, but Haldeman ordered it removed. Strachan then asked Butterfield to handle the cash by giving it to someone Butterfield trusted. On April 7, Butterfield removed the cash and met a close friend at the Key Bridge Marriott in Rosslyn, Virginia. The friend agreed to keep the cash in a safe deposit box in Arlington County, Virginia, and make it available to the White House on demand. Butterfield voluntarily revealed his role in \\"the 350\\" to United States Attorneys shortly after leaving the White House in March 1973. Butterfield also played a very limited role in some of the surveillance conducted by the Nixon White House. On September 7, 1972, Nixon met with Haldeman and Ehrlichman to discuss Senator Edward M. Kennedy's request for Secret Service protection while he campaigned on behalf of the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator George McGovern. Haldeman suggested Butterfield handle the details, and Butterfield, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman met with Nixon later that day to discuss planting the mole. Nixon was convinced Kennedy was an adulterer, and wanted to catch him \\"in the sack with one of his babes\\". Butterfield assigned former Nixon bodyguard Robert Newbrand as the spy in Kennedy's protective detail on September 8. Federal Aviation Administration By late 1972, Butterfield felt his job no longer challenged him, and he informally told President Nixon that he wanted to leave. Nixon offered him a position in the State Department, but Butterfield was not interested in it. Nixon then suggested the Federal Aviation Administration, and Butterfield agreed. On December 19, 1972, President Nixon nominated Butterfield to be the new Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. Federal law, however, required that the Administrator be a civilian, not an active-duty or retired military officer. President Nixon sought legislation to waive this requirement for Butterfield, but it was not forthcoming. Subsequently, in February 1973 Butterfield resigned from the Air Force Reserves, giving up a $10,000 a year pension. President Nixon withdrew Butterfield's nomination on February 26, 1973, and resubmitted it to the Senate the same day. Butterfield was confirmed on March 12, 1973, and he resigned as Deputy Assistant to the President on March 14. United States Secretary of Transportation Claude Brinegar often criticized Butterfield for being lax on aviation safety, allegations Butterfield strongly denied. In early January 1975, President Gerald Ford asked for the resignation of all executive branch officeholders who had been prominent in the Nixon administration. The Washington Post, quoting anonymous White House sources, said Butterfield's dismissal was not retaliation for his role in revealing the White House taping system, and allowed Butterfield to make a case for keeping his job with new White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld. Butterfield did not retain his position, although the White House allowed him to take several months before resigning. Butterfield resigned on March 25, 1975, and left the government on March 31, 1975. Post-government career Butterfield struggled for two years to find employment after leaving the federal government. He eventually worked for a flight service company in San Francisco, California. He then found work with a financial holding company in Los Angeles. Butterfield left the financial industry to start a business and productivity consulting firm, Armistead & Alexander. He retired in 1995. Butterfield was among those who correctly guessed the identity of Watergate informant \\"Deep Throat\\" prior to the disclosure in 2005. He told The Hartford Courant in 1995, \\"I think it was a guy named Mark Felt.\\" Butterfield is a major source for Bob Woodward's 2015 book The Last of the President's Men. Butterfield retained an extensive number of records when he left the White House, some of them historically important, including the \\"zilch\\" memo, which helped form part of the basis for the book. Private life Butterfield married Charlotte Maguire in 1949. They divorced in 1985. Butterfield moved to La Jolla, California, in 1992, where he was a close friend of (and sometimes dated) Audrey Geisel, the widow of Theodor Geisel (the author of children's books, known as \\"Dr. Seuss\\"). He returned to school, obtaining a master's degree in history from the University of California, San Diego. , he was working on a Ph.D. in history, with a focus on the presidential power to pardon. He remains active on the board of directors of several corporations.

A longtime figure in West Coast jazz, Pepper came to prominence in Stan Kenton's big band. He was known for his emotionally charged performances and several stylistic shifts throughout his career, and was described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"the world's great altoist\\" at the time of his death.Yannow, Scott. Art Pepper Biography from Allmusic.com, accessed 12 September 2016 Early life Art Pepper was born in Gardena, California, on September 1, 1925.Dupuis, Robert. \\"Art Pepper.\\" Contemporary Musicians: Profiles of the People in Music. Vol. 18. Detroit, MI: Gale Research, 1997. 164-67. Print. His mother was a 14-year-old runaway; his father, a merchant seaman. Both were violent alcoholics, and when Art was still quite young he was sent to live with his paternal grandmother. He expressed early musical interest and talent, and he was given lessons. He began playing clarinet at nine, switched to alto saxophone at 13 and immediately began jamming on Central Avenue, the black nightclub district of Los Angeles. Career At the age of 17 he began playing professionally with Benny Carter and then became part of the Stan Kenton orchestra, touring with that band until he was drafted in 1943. After the war he returned to Los Angeles and joined the Kenton Innovations Orchestra. By the 1950s Pepper was recognized as one of the leading alto saxophonists in jazz, finishing second only to Charlie Parker as Best Alto Saxophonist in the DownBeat magazine Readers Poll of 1952. Along with Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan and Shelly Manne, and perhaps due more to geography than playing style, Pepper is often associated with the musical movement known as West Coast jazz, as contrasted with the East Coast (or \\"hot\\") jazz of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis. Some of Pepper's most famous albums from the 1950s are Art Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section, Art Pepper + Eleven ‚Äì Modern Jazz Classics, Gettin' Together, and Smack Up. Representative music from this time appears on The Aladdin Recordings (three volumes), The Early Show, The Late Show, The Complete Surf Ride, and The Way It Was!, which features a session recorded with Warne Marsh. His career was repeatedly interrupted by several prison stints stemming from his addiction to heroin, but Pepper managed to have several memorable and productive \\"comebacks\\". Remarkably, his substance abuse and legal travails did not affect the quality of his recordings, which maintained a high level of musicianship throughout his career until his death in 1982. His last comeback saw Pepper, who had started his career in Stan Kenton's big band, becoming a member of Buddy Rich's Big Band from 1968 to 1969. During the mid-1970s and early 1980s he toured Europe and Japan with his own groups and recorded dozens of albums, mostly for Fantasy Records. Personal life Pepper lived for many years in the hills of Echo Park, in Los Angeles. He had become a heroin addict in the 1940s, and his career was interrupted by drug-related prison sentences in 1954‚Äì56, 1960‚Äì61, 1961‚Äì64 and 1964‚Äì65; the final two sentences were served in San Quentin. While in San Quentin he played in an ensemble with saxophonist Frank Morgan. In the late 1960s Pepper spent time in Synanon, a drug rehabilitation group. After beginning methadone therapy in the mid-1970s, Art had a musical comeback and recorded a series of albums including Living Legend, Art Pepper Today, Among Friends, and Live in Japan: Vol. 2. His autobiography,Straight Life: The Story Of Art Pepper by Art Pepper and Laurie Pepper, Da Capo Press (reprint of original 1979 book published by Schirmer Books, a division of MacMillan Publishing). Straight Life (1980, co-written with his third wife Laurie Pepper), discusses the jazz music world, as well as drug and criminal subcultures of mid-20th century California. Soon after the publication of this book, the director Don McGlynn released the documentary film Art Pepper: Notes from a Jazz Survivor, discussing his life and featuring interviews with both Art and his wife Laurie, as well as footage from a live performance in Malibu jazz club. Laurie Pepper also released an interview to NPR. Pepper died of a stroke in Los Angeles on June 15, 1982, aged 56. He is interred in the Abbey of the Psalms Mausoleum in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood.

She was the first female pilot to serve in that capacity. She was discharged from the U.S. Air Force in 1997 after an adulterous affair with the husband of an enlisted subordinate, for military offenses including disobeying a direct order from her commanding officer to break off the affair, and for twice lying under oath to investigators about having done so., The Baltimore Sun; accessed November 20, 2015.. The New York Times.. The New York Times .. The scandal received widespread media attention at the time and was discussed in a U.S. Senate hearing on May 22, 1997. Kelly Flinn worked as a commercial pilot for Trans World Airlines after leaving the Air Force. Background Flinn was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest of five children. She decided to become a pilot after attending Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama. She attended the U.S. Air Force Academy, undergraduate pilot training, and follow-on B-52 bomber training, becoming the first female B-52 pilot in the USAF. Charges, media coverage, and disposition On May 20, 1997, following an adulterous affair with a civilian soccer coach at Minot Air Force Base who was married to a female enlisted subordinate in her chain of command, Flinn was charged by the military with conduct unbecoming an officer, disobeying a lawful order (in writing, to stay away from the married man), making a false official statement in which she lied under oath to Air Force investigators, falsely telling them she had ended the affair, and fraternization (for an additional affair that she had with an enlisted man). Flinn's case, due in part to her high visibility in Air Force recruitment advertisements, drew national attention, eventually creating a media circus. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Ronald Fogleman, testified at a congressional hearing that, \\"In the end, this is not an issue of adultery. This is an issue about an officer, entrusted to fly nuclear weapons, who lied.\\" The media, however, largely treated the case as though Flinn were being tried by the military for the crime of adultery, and castigated the Air Force for allegedly firing her on moral grounds; a New York Times editorial on the case emphasized the adultery, rather than the actual military charges with which she was charged, and blamed the military's \\"antiquated adultery rules and their consistency in administering them, as well as their management training.\\" Following the media outcry, Flinn was allowed to resign from the Air Force by Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall with a general discharge instead of facing a court- martial. She later wrote a book recounting her experiences, entitled Proud to Be: My Life, The Air Force, The Controversy (; ).

After the release of their first album Disconnect, Matthew Morris was replaced with Andrew Sega, who pushed the band's sound in a more experimental electronic direction. Their latest album, Six, was released in September 2019. History Andrew Sega joined Iris in 2002 The band was initiated in 1993 as Forgiving Iris, with members Reagan Jones (vocals/keyboards), Matt Morris (keyboards/programming).[ Iris] at Allmusic The two had met in college and, influenced by 1980s artists such as Erasure and Depeche Mode, began playing covers locally in Austin, Texas. In 1999 they changed their name to Iris and released their debut full-length, Disconnect, which netted them \\"Best Band\\" and \\"Best Album\\" awards at the American Synthpop Awards in 2000. Its single \\"Annie, Would I Lie To You?\\" was one of the best-selling records in label A Different Drum‚Äôs history. After several shows that followed, Reagan Jones and Matthew Morris started having arguments about their musical direction. Morris became focused on his personal life, and wasn't interested into going back to the studio for the second album. He met Andrew Sega through the original singer of CTRL Joel Willard in 2001, and told him that Jones was looking for someone new to work with. Sega and Jones started working on some test tracks, the first of which would later become \\"Unknown\\". They felt that the chemistry between the two worked out so well that they started working on the new record that would become Awakening. Sega added guitars and pushed the band's sound into a more experimental electronic direction. They released their second album Awakening throughout Sega's new label, Diffusion Records. Their next record, Wrath (2005) took a more aggressive approach. Its first single, \\"Appetite\\" went No. 1 on mainstream radio in Poland. A European tour followed, including festivals in Moscow and London. In 2008, Iris released their first CD/DVD combo, Hydra. It featured 3 brand new tracks, as well as remixes from bands like Mesh, Alpinestars, Datguy, Benz & MD, plus a 40 minute \\"behind the scenes\\" tour diary DVD. In 2010, Iris released Blacklight through Infacted Recordings. After finishing its supporting tour in the U.S., the duo parted ways due to a tour argument. There was more than a year of silence between the band members, which ended when Jones sent Sega three demo songs. In 2014, Iris signed with Dependent Records and released Radiant through the label, followed by Six in 2019.

The film features several cult favorite actors, including William Zabka of The Karate Kid fame, Wil Wheaton, Casper Van Dien, Jenny McCarthy, Keith Coogan, Robert Englund, Dana Barron, David Bowe, and Sean Whalen. The film concerns a genetically engineered snake, a python, that escapes and unleashes itself on a small town. It was filmed in Los Angeles and Malibu, California. Python was followed by three sequels: Pythons 2 (2002), New Alcatraz (also known as Boa) and Boa vs. Python (2004), all of which are also made-for-TV films. Plot The crew of a plane gets nervous when the cargo it is carrying starts making noises and shifting. When one of the crew opens the crate, the pilot hears screams from the back. Something attacks him, causing the plane to crash near a town called Ruby. The cargo survives the crash and begins attacking Ruby citizens, starting with a lesbian couple, whose names are Lisa Johnson and Roberta Keeler, camping in the woods. At a swimming hole the next day, John Cooper (Rosanoff), his girlfriend Kristin (Barron), his best friend Tommy (Wheaton), and Tommy's girlfriend Theresa (Mornell) find a pet burmese python belonging to one of the dead women, Lisa. Deputy Greg (Zabka) shows up, mentioning that Lisa is missing and takes the snake. Lisa's body is found, appearing to have been corroded by acids. Greg suspects John, since he works at a plant that uses acids. Complicating things, Greg is also Kristin's ex- fianc√©, with her having left him when her first love came back to town. Scientist Anton Rudolph (Englund) is talking with NSA Special Agent Parker (Van Dien), explaining that the cargo is an abnormally large reticulated python that has been genetically engineered in Southeast Asia, blending several species. In the words of Dr. Rudolph, it is \\"not some garden snake you're going after. We are talking about a perfect killing machine. A 129-foot all-terrain vehicle, capable of speeds exceeding 50 miles an hour, with skin that can deflect an antitank round, enhanced night vision, and a voracious appetite for human flesh.\\" The NSA team plans an assault against the snake, hoping to kill it discreetly before it eats more people. The snake kills a real estate agent (Williamson) and the agent's client (McCarthy). It leaves behind the client and the body of the other lesbian, Roberta Keeler. John enters as the snake leaves, furthering suspicion against him. The sheriff shuts down his brother Brian's plant, furthering the tensions between Brian and him. As John leaves the plant, he runs into Greg's car and his bike is damaged. They end up in a fistfight, mostly over Kristin, though they ultimately reconcile. When the body of the real estate agent is found with the same acid damage, the sheriff orders John arrested. Kristin yells at Greg when they come to arrest John, but he says that he does not think John is the killer. The NSA team and Rudolph arrive, telling the sheriff a story about a psychotic rogue operative imprisoned in a military psychiatric unit who escaped and is committing the murders. He does not believe them, but goes back to the office and frees John. Kristin, Tommy, Theresa, and he plan to go on a trip the next morning. The NSA set up base at a water-treatment center. They use radar to find where the snake is likely to be, then have the police set up a perimeter to keep people out of the zone. Believing the snake to be sleeping, the team wastes most of its ammunition on the snake's shed skin. Agent Parker realizes the snake set them up using its skin as a decoy. The snake arrives and kills the team, the sole survivor being Rudolph who keeps himself standing motionless in front of the creature. Theresa's morning shower is interrupted by the snake. Though she is able to escape, the snake eats Tommy. Theresa drives away, but the snake follows. It gets in front of her and rips the rear axle off, disabling the truck. She gets away again and hides in a crevice. When Tommy and Theresa do not arrive to pick them up, John and Kristin go looking for them, finding the wrecked truck. Theresa tries to warn them as the snake comes to attack, but they cannot hear her. John and Kristin escape using Tommy and Theresa's bikes from the truck. They make it to the water-treatment center, where Theresa later joins them, and find Rudolph in shock. The group realizes that they must do something about the snake or it will get to the town. They call Greg on the radio and fill him in on a plan they have devised. They lure the snake into the water-treatment plant by having it chase John through a shaft, while they set a bomb near the entrance. Kristin drops a line down another shaft for John to escape. The other two escape through the regular door, where Greg is waiting to drive them to the other shaft. They pull John out and the python is unable to climb up the shaft. Trapped in the tunnel, the python returns to the doorway entrance. The group returns to the entrance to trigger the bomb, but it does not detonate. Rudolph says the snake must have torn out the antenna when it crashed into the bunker, so he leaves his pet snake with Kristin and runs back in to reset it. While Rudolph resets the charges, he is confronted by the snake, but is able to succeed in his task. The charges go off, killing Rudolph, and the other four are celebrating their success, but the python emerges unscathed. They flee in Greg's police car, and come up with a new plan to penetrate the snake's hide by luring the snake into a vat of acid at John's plating plant. Once there, John acts as the bait once again, while Kristin uses a winch to push the snake's underbelly into one of the vats, causing the snake to be disemboweled and killed by the acid. Six months later, Greg has been accepted into Quantico to be an FBI agent, the plant has been reopened as a bar/bike shop where the snake's skin is used as a sales tool, and John finds out that Kristin and he are soon to be parents.

Most of the mountain lies within Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in the City and Borough of Yakutat, Alaska (USA), though the summit borders Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, British Columbia (Canada). It is also designated as Boundary Peak 164 or as US/Canada Boundary Point #164.

Geography Mount Fairweather is located right above Glacier Bay in the Fairweather Range of the Saint Elias Mountains. Mount Fairweather also marks the northwest extremity of the Alaska Panhandle. Like many peaks in the St. Elias Mountains, Mount Fairweather has great vertical relief due to its dramatic rise from Glacier Bay. However, due to poor weather in the area, this effect is usually obscured with the clouds which often hides the summit from view. Known in the Tlingit language as Tsalxhaan, it is said this mountain and Yaas'√©it'aa Shaa (Mt. St. Elias) were originally next to each other but had an argument and separated. Their children, the mountains in between the two peaks, are called Tsalxhaan Yatx'i (Children of Tsalxaan.) Weather Despite its name, Mount Fairweather has generally harsh weather conditions. It receives over 100 inches (254 cm) of precipitation each year (mostly snow) and sees temperatures of around . Climbing history Dixon Harbor with Mt. Fairweather in the centre, 1925.

Summit reached on July 10, 1973. First Ascent After failing to reach the summit in 1926 due to terrain difficulty on their chosen route, Allen Carpe, W.S. Ladd, Andy Taylor returned in 1931 along with a new member Terry Moore. In early April the group began their approach by boat but stormy weather delayed them rounding Cape Fairweather until April 17. They reached Lituya Bay and unloaded their supplies on the beach. Backtracking along the coast, they made their way to the Fairweather Glacier. From base camp in a spot they called Paradise Valley, they decided to attempt the mountain from the south rather than via the west ridge. Due to deep snow, they realized that skis and snowshoes would be of great help so Carpe and Moore made the round trip to fetch them from Lituya Bay. They ascended the glacier from base camp and setup camp at on the mountain's south face. On May 25, they established high camp at after making significant progress up a ridge on a rare day of good weather. However, the weather turned and they were forced to descend after an overnight coating of snow. After waiting out the snowstorm for six days at lower camp, they made their way back up to high camp on June 2. They left for the summit at 1:30 am on June 3 and having reached the southeast shoulder by mid-morning, they were feeling so confident that they left the willow wands behind. However, higher altitude and the weeks of hard effort slowed their progress and then the weather changed. By 1 pm not far from the summit, they decided to retreat and had to descend without the wands to guide them. They managed to reach the tents by 4 pm. Ladd and Taylor volunteered to descend due to dwindling supplies at high camp with the hope that Carpe and Moore would be able to make another attempt in good weather. The storm raged for four days before it finally cleared in the evening on June 7. At 10 pm, Carpe and Moore set out for the summit and with no further difficulties made it to the top.

Neuroethology is the evolutionary and comparative approach to the study of animal behavior and its underlying mechanistic control by the nervous system.Hoyle, G. (1984) The scope of Neuroethology. The Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 7: 367‚Äì412.Ewert, P. (1980) Neuroethology. Springer-Verlag. New York.Camhi, J. (1984) Neuroethology. Sinauer. Sunderland Mass. This interdisciplinary branch of behavioral neuroscience endeavors to understand how the central nervous system translates biologically relevant stimuli into natural behavior. For example, many bats are capable of echolocation which is used for prey capture and navigation. The auditory system of bats is often cited as an example for how acoustic properties of sounds can be converted into a sensory map of behaviorally relevant features of sounds.Suga, N. (1989). \\"Principles of auditory information-processing derived from neuroethology.\\" J Exp Biol 146: 277‚Äì86. Neuroethologists hope to uncover general principles of the nervous system from the study of animals with exaggerated or specialized behaviors. As its name implies, neuroethology is a multidisciplinary field composed of neurobiology (the study of the nervous system) and ethology (the study of animal behavior in natural conditions). A central theme of the field of neuroethology, delineating it from other branches of neuroscience, is this focus on natural behavior, which may be thought of as those behaviors generated through means of natural selection (i.e. finding mates, navigation, locomotion, predator avoidance) rather than behaviors in disease states, or behavioral tasks that are particular to the laboratory. Philosophy Neuroethology is an integrative approach to the study of animal behavior that draws upon several disciplines. Its approach stems from the theory that animals' nervous systems have evolved to address problems of sensing and acting in certain environmental niches and that their nervous systems are best understood in the context of the problems they have evolved to solve. In accordance with Krogh's principle, neuroethologists often study animals that are \\"specialists\\" in the behavior the researcher wishes to study e.g. honeybees and social behavior, bat echolocation, owl sound localization, etc. The scope of neuroethological inquiry might be summarized by J√∂rg-Peter Ewert, a pioneer of neuroethology, when he considers the types of questions central to neuroethology in his 1980 introductory text to the field: # How are stimuli detected by an organism? # How are environmental stimuli in the external world represented in the nervous system? # How is information about a stimulus acquired, stored and recalled by the nervous system? # How is a behavioral pattern encoded by neural networks? # How is behavior coordinated and controlled by the nervous system? # How can the ontogenetic development of behavior be related to neural mechanisms? Often central to addressing questions in neuroethology are comparative methodologies, drawing upon knowledge about related organisms' nervous systems, anatomies, life histories, behaviors and environmental niches. While it is not unusual for many types of neurobiology experiments to give rise to behavioral questions, many neuroethologists often begin their research programs by observing a species' behavior in its natural environment. Other approaches to understanding nervous systems include the systems identification approach, popular in engineering. The idea is to stimulate the system using a non-natural stimulus with certain properties. The system's response to the stimulus may be used to analyze the operation of the system. Such an approach is useful for linear systems, but the nervous system is notoriously nonlinear, and neuroethologists argue that such an approach is limited. This argument is supported by experiments in the auditory system, which show that neural responses to complex sounds, like social calls, can not be predicted by the knowledge gained from studying the responses due to pure tones (one of the non-natural stimuli favored by auditory neurophysiologists). This is because of the non-linearity of the system. Modern neuroethology is largely influenced by the research techniques used. Neural approaches are necessarily very diverse, as is evident through the variety of questions asked, measuring techniques used, relationships explored, and model systems employed. Techniques utilized since 1984 include the use of intracellular dyes, which make maps of identified neurons possible, and the use of brain slices, which bring vertebrate brains into better observation through intracellular electrodes (Hoyle 1984). Currently, other fields toward which neuroethology may be headed include computational neuroscience, molecular genetics, neuroendocrinology and epigenetics. The existing field of neural modeling may also expand into neuroethological terrain, due to its practical uses in robotics. In all this, neuroethologists must use the right level of simplicity to effectively guide research towards accomplishing the goals of neuroethology. Critics of neuroethology might consider it a branch of neuroscience concerned with 'animal trivia'. Though neuroethological subjects tend not to be traditional neurobiological model systems (i.e. Drosophila, C. elegans, or Danio rerio), neuroethological approaches emphasizing comparative methods have uncovered many concepts central to neuroscience as a whole, such as lateral inhibition, coincidence detection, and sensory maps. The discipline of neuroethology has also discovered and explained the only vertebrate behavior for which the entire neural circuit has been described: the electric fish jamming avoidance response. Beyond its conceptual contributions, neuroethology makes indirect contributions to advancing human health. By understanding simpler nervous systems, many clinicians have used concepts uncovered by neuroethology and other branches of neuroscience to develop treatments for devastating human diseases. History The field of neuroethology owes part of its existence to the establishment of ethology as a unique discipline within the discipline of Zoology. Although animal behavior had been studied since the time of Aristotle (384‚Äì342 BC), it was not until the early twentieth century that ethology finally became distinguished from natural science (a strictly descriptive field) and ecology. The main catalysts behind this new distinction were the research and writings of Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen. Konrad Lorenz was born in Austria in 1903, and is widely known for his contribution of the theory of fixed action patterns (FAPs): endogenous, instinctive behaviors involving a complex sequence of movements that are triggered (\\"released\\") by a certain kind of stimulus. This sequence always proceeds to completion, even if the original stimulus is removed. It is also species-specific and performed by nearly all members. Lorenz constructed his famous \\"hydraulic model\\" to help illustrate this concept, as well as the concept of action specific energy, or drives. Niko Tinbergen was born in the Netherlands in 1907 and worked closely with Lorenz in the development of the FAP theory; their studies focused on the egg retrieval response of nesting geese. Tinbergen performed extensive research on the releasing mechanisms of particular FAPs, and used the bill- pecking behavior of baby herring gulls as his model system. This led to the concept of the supernormal stimulus. Tinbergen is also well known for his four questions that he believed ethologists should be asking about any given animal behavior; among these is that of the mechanism of the behavior, on a physiological, neural and molecular level, and this question can be thought of in many regards as the keystone question in neuroethology. Tinbergen also emphasized the need for ethologists and neurophysiologists to work together in their studies, a unity that has become a reality in the field of neuroethology. Unlike behaviorism, which studied animals' reactions to non- natural stimuli in artificial, laboratory conditions, ethology sought to categorize and analyze the natural behaviors of animals in a field setting. Similarly, neuroethology asks questions about the neural bases of naturally occurring behaviors, and seeks to mimic the natural context as much as possible in the laboratory. Although the development of ethology as a distinct discipline was crucial to the advent of neuroethology, equally important was the development of a more comprehensive understanding of neuroscience. Contributors to this new understanding were the Spanish Neuroanatomist, Ramon y Cajal (born in 1852), and physiologists Charles Sherrington, Edgar Adrian, Alan Hodgkin, and Andrew Huxley. Charles Sherrington, who was born in Great Britain in 1857, is famous for his work on the nerve synapse as the site of transmission of nerve impulses, and for his work on reflexes in the spinal cord. His research also led him to hypothesize that every muscular activation is coupled to an inhibition of the opposing muscle. He was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in 1932 along with Lord Edgar Adrian who made the first physiological recordings of neural activity from single nerve fibers. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley (born 1914 and 1917, respectively, in Great Britain), are known for their collaborative effort to understand the production of action potentials in the giant axons of squid. The pair also proposed the existence of ion channels to facilitate action potential initiation, and were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1963 for their efforts. As a result of this pioneering research, many scientists then sought to connect the physiological aspects of the nervous and sensory systems to specific behaviors. These scientists ‚Äì Karl von Frisch, Erich von Holst, and Theodore Bullock ‚Äì are frequently referred to as the \\"fathers\\" of neuroethology. Neuroethology did not really come into its own, though, until the 1970s and 1980s, when new, sophisticated experimental methods allowed researchers such as Masakazu Konishi, Walter Heiligenberg, J√∂rg-Peter Ewert, and others to study the neural circuits underlying verifiable behavior. Modern neuroethology The International Society for Neuroethology represents the present discipline of neuroethology, which was founded on the occasion of the NATO-Advanced Study Institute \\"Advances in Vertebrate Neuroethology\\" (August 13‚Äì24, 1981) organized by J.-P. Ewert, D.J. Ingle and R.R. Capranica, held at the University of Kassel in Hofgeismar, Germany (cf. report Trends in Neurosci. 5:141-143,1982). Its first president was Theodore H. Bullock. The society has met every three years since its first meeting in Tokyo in 1986. Its membership draws from many research programs around the world; many of its members are students and faculty members from medical schools and neurobiology departments from various universities. Modern advances in neurophysiology techniques have enabled more exacting approaches in an ever-increasing number of animal systems, as size limitations are being dramatically overcome. Survey of the most recent (2007) congress of the ISN meeting symposia topics gives some idea of the field's breadth: *Comparative aspects of spatial memory (rodents, birds, humans, bats) *Influences of higher processing centers in active sensing (primates, owls, electric fish, rodents, frogs) *Animal signaling plasticity over many time scales (electric fish, frogs, birds) *Song production and learning in passerine birds *Primate sociality *Optimal function of sensory systems (flies, moths, frogs, fish) *Neuronal complexity in behavior (insects, computational) *Contributions of genes to behavior (Drosophila, honeybees, zebrafish) *Eye and head movement (crustaceans, humans, robots) *Hormonal actions in brain and behavior (rodents, primates, fish, frogs, and birds) *Cognition in insects (honeybee) Application to technology Neuroethology can help create advancements in technology through an advanced understanding of animal behavior. Model systems were generalized from the study of simple and related animals to humans. For example, the neuronal cortical space map discovered in bats, a specialized champion of hearing and navigating, elucidated the concept of a computational space map. In addition, the discovery of the space map in the barn owl led to the first neuronal example of the Jeffress model. This understanding is translatable to understanding spatial localization in humans, a mammalian relative of the bat. Today, knowledge learned from neuroethology are being applied in new technologies. For example, Randall Beer and his colleagues used algorithms learned from insect walking behavior to create robots designed to walk on uneven surfaces (Beer et al.). Neuroethology and technology contribute to one another bidirectionally. Neuroethologists seek to understand the neural basis of a behavior as it would occur in an animal's natural environment but the techniques for neurophysiological analysis are lab-based, and cannot be performed in the field setting. This dichotomy between field and lab studies poses a challenge for neuroethology. From the neurophysiology perspective, experiments must be designed for controls and objective rigor, which contrasts with the ethology perspective ‚Äì that the experiment be applicable to the animal's natural condition, which is uncontrolled, or subject to the dynamics of the environment. An early example of this is when Walter Rudolf Hess developed focal brain stimulation technique to examine a cat's brain controls of vegetative functions in addition to other behaviors. Even though this was a breakthrough in technological abilities and technique, it was not used by many neuroethologists originally because it compromised a cat's natural state, and, therefore, in their minds, devalued the experiments' relevance to real situations. When intellectual obstacles like this were overcome, it led to a golden age of neuroethology, by focusing on simple and robust forms of behavior, and by applying modern neurobiological methods to explore the entire chain of sensory and neural mechanisms underlying these behaviors (Zupanc 2004). New technology allows neuroethologists to attach electrodes to even very sensitive parts of an animal such as its brain while it interacts with its environment. The founders of neuroethology ushered this understanding and incorporated technology and creative experimental design. Since then even indirect technological advancements such as battery-powered and waterproofed instruments have allowed neuroethologists to mimic natural conditions in the lab while they study behaviors objectively. In addition, the electronics required for amplifying neural signals and for transmitting them over a certain distance have enabled neuroscientists to record from behaving animals performing activities in naturalistic environments. Emerging technologies can complement neuroethology, augmenting the feasibility of this valuable perspective of natural neurophysiology. Another challenge, and perhaps part of the beauty of neuroethology, is experimental design. The value of neuroethological criteria speak to the reliability of these experiments, because these discoveries represent behavior in the environments in which they evolved. Neuroethologists foresee future advancements through using new technologies and techniques, such as computational neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, and molecular genetics that mimic natural environments.Zupanc, G√ºnther K.H. (2004). Behavioral Neurobiology an Integrative Approach. Oxford University Press. New York. Case studies Jamming avoidance response In 1963, Akira Watanabe and Kimihisa Takeda discovered the behavior of the jamming avoidance response in the knifefish Eigenmannia sp. In collaboration with T.H. Bullock and colleagues, the behavior was further developed. Finally, the work of W. Heiligenberg expanded it into a full neuroethology study by examining the series of neural connections that led to the behavior. Eigenmannia is a weakly electric fish that can generate electric discharges through electrocytes in its tail. Furthermore, it has the ability to electrolocate by analyzing the perturbations in its electric field. However, when the frequency of a neighboring fish's current is very close (less than 20 Hz difference) to that of its own, the fish will avoid having their signals interfere through a behavior known as Jamming Avoidance Response. If the neighbor's frequency is higher than the fish's discharge frequency, the fish will lower its frequency, and vice versa. The sign of the frequency difference is determined by analyzing the \\"beat\\" pattern of the incoming interference which consists of the combination of the two fish's discharge patterns. Neuroethologists performed several experiments under Eigenmannias natural conditions to study how it determined the sign of the frequency difference. They manipulated the fish's discharge by injecting it with curare which prevented its natural electric organ from discharging. Then, an electrode was placed in its mouth and another was placed at the tip of its tail. Likewise, the neighboring fish's electric field was mimicked using another set of electrodes. This experiment allowed neuroethologists to manipulate different discharge frequencies and observe the fish's behavior. From the results, they were able to conclude that the electric field frequency, rather than an internal frequency measure, was used as a reference. This experiment is significant in that not only does it reveal a crucial neural mechanism underlying the behavior but also demonstrates the value neuroethologists place on studying animals in their natural habitats. Feature analysis in toad vision The recognition of prey and predators in the toad was first studied in depth by J√∂rg-Peter Ewert (Ewert 1974; see also 2004). He began by observing the natural prey-catching behavior of the common toad (Bufo bufo) and concluded that the animal followed a sequence that consisted of stalking, binocular fixation, snapping, swallowing and mouth-wiping. However, initially, the toad's actions were dependent on specific features of the sensory stimulus: whether it demonstrated worm or anti-worm configurations. It was observed that the worm configuration, which signaled prey, was initiated by movement along the object's long axis, whereas anti-worm configuration, which signaled predator, was due to movement along the short axis. (Zupanc 2004). Ewert and coworkers adopted a variety of methods to study the predator versus prey behavior response. They conducted recording experiments where they inserted electrodes into the brain, while the toad was presented with worm or anti-worm stimuli. This technique was repeated at different levels of the visual system and also allowed feature detectors to be identified. In focus was the discovery of prey-selective neurons in the optic tectum, whose axons could be traced towards the snapping pattern generating cells in the hypoglossal nucleus. The discharge patterns of prey-selective tectal neurons in response to prey objects ‚Äì in freely moving toads ‚Äì \\"predicted\\" prey-catching reactions such as snapping. Another approach, called stimulation experiment, was carried out in freely moving toads. Focal electrical stimuli were applied to different regions of the brain, and the toad's response was observed. When the thalamic- pretectal region was stimulated, the toad exhibited escape responses, but when the tectum was stimulated in an area close to prey-selective neurons, the toad engaged in prey catching behavior (Carew 2000). Furthermore, neuroanatomical experiments were carried out where the toad's thalamic-pretectal/tectal connection was lesioned and the resulting deficit noted: the prey-selective properties were abolished both in the responses of prey-selective neurons and in the prey catching behavior. These and other experiments suggest that prey selectivity results from pretecto-tectal influences. Ewert and coworkers showed in toads that there are stimulus-response mediating pathways that translate perception (of visual sign stimuli) into action (adequate behavioral responses). In addition there are modulatory loops that initiate, modify or specify this mediation (Ewert 2004). Regarding the latter, for example, the telencephalic caudal ventral striatum is involved in a loop gating the stimulus-response mediation in a manner of directed attention. The telencephalic ventral medial pallium (‚Äûprimordium hippocampi\\"), however, is involved in loops that either modify prey-selection due to associative learning or specify prey-selection due to non-associative learning, respectively. Computational neuroethology Computational neuroethology (CN or CNE) is concerned with the computer modelling of the neural mechanisms underlying animal behaviors. Together with the term \\"artificial ethology,\\" the term \\"computational neuroethology\\" was first published in literature by Achacoso and Yamamoto in the Spring of 1990, based on their pioneering work on the connectome of C. elegans in 1989, with further publications in 1992. Computational neuroethology was argued for in depth later in 1990 by Randall Beer and by Dave CliffD. Cliff (1990) Computational Neuroethology: A provisional manifesto. In J.-A. Meyer and S. W. Wilson (editors): From Animals to Animats: Proceedings of the First International Conference on the Simulation of Adaptive Behaviour (SAB90).

A. Arbib (1987) Levels of Modeling of Mechanisms of Visually Guided Behavior. The Behavioral and Brain Sciences 10:407‚Äì465. CNE systems work within a closed-loop environment; that is, they perceive their (perhaps artificial) environment directly, rather than through human input, as is typical in AI systems.D.

For example, Barlow et al. developed a time-dependent model for the retina of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus on a Connection Machine (Model CM-2). Instead of feeding the model retina with idealized input signals, they exposed the simulation to digitized video sequences made underwater, and compared its response with those of real animals.

Definitive, macroscopic remains of these metazoans are found in the fossil record from the Ediacaran period of the Neoproterozoic era onwards, although they do not become common until the Late Devonian period in the latter half of the Paleozoic era. Perhaps the best known macrofossils group is the dinosaurs. Other popularly known animal-derived macrofossils include trilobites, crustaceans, echinoderms, brachiopods, mollusks, bony fishes, sharks, Vertebrate teeth, and shells of numerous invertebrate groups. This is because hard organic parts, such as bones, teeth, and shells resist decay, and are the most commonly preserved and found animal fossils. Exclusively soft-bodied animals‚Äîsuch as jellyfish, flatworms, nematodes, and insects‚Äîare consequently rarely fossilized, as these groups do not produce hard organic parts.  Vertebrate Paleozoology  Vertebrate paleozoology refers to the use of morphological, temporal, and stratigraphic data to map vertebrate history in evolutionary theory. Vertebrates are classified as a subphylum of Chordata, a phylum used to classify species adhering to a rod- shaped, flexible body type called a notochord. They differ from other phyla in that other phyla may have cartilage or cartilage-like tissues forming a sort of skeleton, but only vertebrates possess what we define as bone. Classes of vertebrates listed in chronological order from oldest to most recent include heterostracans, osteostracans, coelolepid agnathans, acanthodians, osteichthyan fishes, chondrichthyan fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. All vertebrates are studied under standard evolutionary generalizations of behavior and life process, although there is controversy over whether population can be accurately estimated from limited fossil resources. Evolutionary origins of vertebrates as well as the phylum Chordata have not been scientifically determined. Many believe vertebrates diverged from a common ancestor of chordates and echinoderms. This belief is well supported by the prehistoric marine creature Amphioxus. Amphioxus does not possess bone, making it an invertebrate, but it has common features with vertebrates including a segmented body and a notochord. This could imply that Amphioxus is a transitional form between an early chordate, echinoderm or common ancestor, and vertebrates.  Quantitative Paleozoology  Quantitative paleozoology is a process of taking a census of fossil types rather than inventory. They differ in that inventory refers to a detailed log of individual fossils, whereas census attempts to group individual fossils to tally the total number of a species. This information can be used to determine which species were most dominant and which had the largest population at a time period or in a geological region. In the early 1930s, paleontologists Chester Stock and Hildegarde Howard devised special units for quantitative paleozoology and quantitative paleontology. The first unit used, Number of Identified Species (NISP), specified exact quantity of fossils from a specific species recorded. Stock and Howard determined this unit to be problematic for quantitative purposes as an excess of a small fossil‚Äîsuch as teeth‚Äîcould exaggerate quantity of the species. There was also an amount of confusion as to whether bone fragments should be assembled and counted as one bone or tallied individually. Stock and Howard then devised the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI), which estimated the minimum number of animals needed to produce the fossils recorded. For example, if five scapulae from a species were found, it might be difficult to determine whether some of them were paired right and left on one individual or whether each came from a different individual, which could alter census, but it could be said that there must be at least three individuals to produce five scapulae. Three would thus be the MNI. In rare cases where enough of a collection of fossils can be assembled into individuals as to provide an accurate number of individuals, the unit used is Actual Number of Individuals, or ANI. Another unit commonly used in quantitative paleozoology is biomass. Biomass is defined as the amount of tissue in an area or from a species. It is calculated by estimating an average weight based on similar modern species and multiplying it by the MNI. This yields an estimate of how much the entire population of a species may have weighed. Problems with this measurement include the difference in weight between youngsters and adults, seasonal weight changes due to diet and hibernation, and the difficulty of accurately estimating the weight of a creature with only a skeletal reference. It is also difficult to determine exact age of fossilized matter within a year or a decade, so a biomass might be grossly exaggerated or under exaggerated if the estimated time frame in which the fossils were alive is incorrect. A similar measurement to biomass is meat weight. To determine meat weight, MNI is multiplied by the amount of meat an individual is thought to have provided, then multiplied by the percentage of that meat thought to be edible. This gives an estimate of ‚Äúpounds of usable meat‚Äù per individual which might have been harvested by prehistoric hunters. For example, a male Wapiti has an average weight of 400 kg, and in a particular study, the MNI of Wapiti was found to be 10. This would create a biomass of 4,000 kg. If the amount of edible meat is estimated at 50 percent, this would result in a meat weight of 2,000 kg. The biggest problem with this method is the debate over ‚Äúpercent of usable meat.‚Äù Different views on which parts of a species are edible and which are not as well as whether or not primitive butchers would have been able to access and prepare different parts have led to controversy.  Conservation Biology  Paleozoological data is used in research concerning conservation biology. Conservation biology refers to biological study used for conservation, control, and preservation of various species and ecosystems. In this context, the paleozoological data used is obtained from recently deceased decomposing matter rather than prehistoric matter. R. Lee Lyman, Professor and Chair Department of Anthropology at the University of Missouri, writes that paleozoological research can provide data such as extinction rates and causes and ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù peaks and drops in population which can be used to predict future patterns and to design maximally effective methods of controlling these patterns. In addition, paleozoological data can be used to compare current to former population and distribution of a species.

Dungeness A is a legacy Magnox power station that was connected to the National Grid in 1965 and has reached the end of its life. Dungeness B is an advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) power station consisting of two 1496 MWt reactors, which began operation in 1983 and 1985 respectively, and have been non-operational since 2018 due to ongoing safety concerns. Dungeness B however has had its licence renewed until 2028. There were many problems during construction of the second power station, which was the first full-scale AGR. It was supposed to be completed in 1970, but the project collapsed in 1969. The CEGB took over project management and appointed British Nuclear Design and Construction (BNDC) as main contractor. There were more problems and by 1975 the CEGB was reporting that the power station would not be completed until 1977 and the cost had risen to ¬£280 million. By completion the cost had risen to ¬£685 million, four times the initial estimate in inflation-adjusted terms. In March 2009, serious problems were found when Unit B21 was shut down for maintenance, and the reactor remained out of action for almost 18 months. In 2015, the plant was given a second ten-year life extension, taking the proposed closure date to 2028. In September 2018, both units were shut down and, as of August 2020, were expected to restart in December 2020. Dungeness A Dungeness A is a legacy Magnox power station that was connected to the National Grid in 1965 and has reached the end of its life. It possessed two nuclear reactors producing 219 MW of electricity each, with a total capacity of 438 MW. The construction was undertaken by a consortium known as the Nuclear Power Group ('TNPG').The UK Magnox and AGR Power Station Projects The reactors were supplied by TNPG and the turbines by C. A. Parsons & Co. There were originally four √ó 142.5 MW turbo-alternators, these were later down-rated to 106 MW machines.CEGB Statistical Yearbook (various dates). CEGB, London. Steam pressure and temperature at the turbine stop valves was 535 psi (37.6 bar) and 391¬∞C.

This is connected to the Ashford to Hastings line via an east-facing junction located to the west of Appledore station. Closure and decommissioning On 31 December 2006 the A station ceased power generation. Defuelling was completed in June 2012 and the demolition of the turbine hall was completed in June 2015. It is expected to enter the 'care and maintenance' stage of decommissioning in 2027. Demolition of reactor buildings and final site clearance is planned for 2088 to 2098. Dungeness B Dungeness B is an advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) power station consisting of two 1496 MWt reactors, which began operation in 1983 and 1985 respectively. Dungeness B was the first commercial scale AGR power station to be constructed. Its design was based on the much smaller Windscale AGR prototype, the WAGR. The ¬£89 million contract was awarded in August 1965 to Atomic Power Construction ('APC'), a consortium backed by Crompton Parkinson, Fairey Engineering, International Combustion and Richardsons Westgarth. The completion date was set as 1970. During construction, many problems were encountered in scaling up the WAGR design. Problems with the construction of the pressure vessel liner had distorted it, so that the boilers, which were to fit in an annular space between the reactor and the pressure vessel, could not be installed, and the liner had to be partially dismantled and rebuilt. This work cost about ¬£200,000, but there was a huge cost of financing an extra 18 unproductive months for a power station costing around ¬£100 million, of which 60% was already complete.The Times, Tuesday, 10 December 1968; pg. 24; Issue 57430; col A Serious problems were also discovered with the design of the boilers, which had to withstand the pounding of hot carbon dioxide (CO2), pressurised to and pumped around the reactor coolant circuit by massive gas circulators. As a consequence, the casings, hangers and tube supports all had to be redesigned. The cost of the modifications, and financing during the delays, caused severe financial pressures for the consortium and its backers, and in 1969 APC collapsed into administration. The CEGB took over project management, imposed light penalties in order not to cripple Fairey and International Combustion, and appointed British Nuclear Design and Construction (BNDC) as main contractor. In 1971, problems with corrosion of mild steel components in the first generation Magnox reactors gave the designers cause for concern. The Dungeness B restraint couplings - mechanical linkages that held the graphite core in place whilst allowing it to expand and contract in response to temperature changes - were made of mild steel and could be subject to the same corrosion. It was decided to replace them with components made from a new material.The Times, Thursday, 11 March 1971; pg. 19; Issue 58119; col E In 1972, problems were found with the galvanised wire that was used to attach thermocouples to stainless steel boiler tubes. During heat treatment of the tubes at temperatures up to 1,050¬∞C, the galvanising zinc diffused into the tubes and made them brittle. The cost had by then risen to ¬£170 million.The Times, Saturday, 4 November 1972; pg. 19; Issue 58623; col C By 1975, the CEGB was reporting that the power station would not be completed until 1977 and that its cost had risen to ¬£280 million.The Times, Thursday, 6 November 1975; pg. 20; Issue 59546; col A By 1979 the cost had risen further to ¬£410 million.The Times, Wednesday, 23 January 1980; pg. 3; Issue 60531; col E Reactor 1 first generated power on 3 April 1983, 13 years behind schedule and at a cost of ¬£685 million, four times the initial estimate in inflation-adjusted terms. As with the \\"A\\" station, the turbines were built by C.A. Parsons & Company and the station has two 660 MWe turbo-alternator sets, producing a maximum output of 1320 MWe, though net output is 1090 MWe after the effects of house load, and downrating the reactor output due to corrosion and vibration concerns.British Energy: Dungeness B In March 2009, serious problems were found when Unit B21 was shut down for maintenance, and the reactor remained out of action for almost 18 months. On 24 November 2009, a small fire in the boiler annexe of Unit B22 caused the second reactor to be shut down as well. Subsequently, Unit B22 has been intermittently shut down for up to several months at a time. Unit B21 was restarted in August 2010. Unplanned shutdowns continued into 2011, with B21 down for repairs from November 2011 to March 2012. In 2005, the station's accounting closure date was extended by ten years, which would allow it to continue operating until 2018, 35 years after first power generation. In 2015, the plant was given another ten-year life extension, allowing an upgrade to control room computer systems and improved flood defences, taking the accounting closure date to 2028. In September 2018 the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) directed that EDF Energy carry out a reassessment of corrosion of safety-related concealed systems. Inspections showed that seismic restraints, pipework and storage vessels were found to be \\"corroded to an unacceptable condition\\", and that would have been the state when the reactor was operating. Remedial measures included the upgrading of more than 300 metres of pipeline and of carbon dioxide storage vessels. The ONR classified this as a level 2 incident on the International Nuclear Event Scale. Dungeness B was initially expected to return to service in February 2019, later put back to 30 September 2019 to complete inspections. As of August 2020, the shut down of units B21 and B22 has been extended to December 2020 after being taken offline in September 2018.  Electricity output  In 2015 Dungeness B produced 4.4 TWh of energy. The operators claimed that this amounted to a saving of 3.4 million tonnes of CO2. Consideration of Dungeness C On 15 April 2009, Dungeness was included in a list of 11 potential sites for new nuclear power stations, at the request of EDF Energy, which owns and operates Dungeness B. The government did not include Dungeness C in its draft National Policy Statement published on 9 November 2009, citing environmental reasons and concerns about coastal erosion and associated flood risk. The site was ruled out by Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Chris Huhne in October 2010 with the former government's list of eleven potential sites reduced to eight. Despite these environmental concerns, local Conservative MP Damian Collins, supported by some residents, lobbied Parliament to reconsider that position. HVDC station From 1961 to 1984, Dungeness power station also housed the mercury arc valves of the static inverter plant converting AC into DC for transmission on HVDC Cross-Channel, the high-voltage direct current power cable carrying electric power across the English Channel to France. In 1983, a more powerful new inverter at Sellindge replaced this facility. Ownership Both stations were originally built, owned, and operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). Following privatisation of the electricity supply industry and the later part- privatisation of the nuclear power generating industry they are now owned by two different bodies: the original Magnox plant Dungeness A by the non- departmental government body the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and newer AGR Dungeness B by EDF through British subsidiary EDF Energy. Location The stations are built on a large area of open shingle, measuring 12 km by 6 km, which has been deposited by the sea and built up over thousands of years. The entire area is moving slowly north and east as the sea moves the shingle from one side of the headland to the other. It is surrounded by a nature reserve Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A fleet of lorries is used to continuously maintain shingle sea defences for the plant as coastal erosion would otherwise move shingle away at an estimated rate of 6 m per year. Around 30,000 cubic metres of shingle are moved each year. It seems that deposition on the north shore of the headland does not keep pace with erosion, although the power stations are about 1 km to the west of that shore. In all, 90,000 cubic metres are moved each year along parts of the coast between Pett Level and Hythe. This is necessary for the safety of the entire area including the power stations. Around 100 million litres of cooling water are extracted and returned to the sea each hour, after being heated by 12 deg Celsius (22 deg F). The headland and the coastline between Pett Level and Hythe are volatile. In recorded history Walland Marsh to the west of the power stations has been flooded. In the space of sixty years severe inundation occurred, temporarily bringing the sea inland to Appledore and the original mouth of the River Rother from north of the headland at Romney to the south at Rye Harbour. The site is a few metres above Mean Sea Level and would be isolated in the event of flooding of the magnitude that submerged large areas of East Anglia and the Netherlands in 1953. It has been conjectured that the hurricane of 1987 did not bring the sea to the stations because there was a low tide at the time. Climate change could cause more frequent and powerful storms, and associated waves and surges are possible though not probable, and might increase the instability of the headland. In the media The station was used in the filming of the Doctor Who serial The Claws of Axos in January 1971. The site provides a key plot point in the 2016 book, Alan Partridge: Nomad. The station is within sight of artist Derek Jarman's garden at Prospect Cottage. The film The Garden was filmed at the house, and it was the main subject of an episode of BBC's Countryfile in February 2020.

It was founded in 1865 and is the second oldest conservatory and oldest continually operating conservatory in the United States. It is one of the few American conservatories to be completely attached to a liberal arts college, allowing students the opportunity to pursue degrees in both music and a traditional liberal arts subject via the five year Double- Degree program. Like the rest of Oberlin College, the student body of the conservatory is almost exclusively undergraduate. History Bibbins Hall houses many of the conservatory's Classical Department and administration. The Oberlin Collegiate Institute was built on of land, founded in 1833 and became Oberlin College in 1850. In 1867, two years after the Oberlin Conservatory's founding in 1865, the previously separate Oberlin Conservatory became incorporated with the college on a similar grant.Fletcher, Robert Samuel. A History of Oberlin College From Its Foundation Through the Civil War. Chicago: R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company, 1943. Print. In tandem, the administration claimed that \\"Oberlin is peculiar in that which is good,\\" notable as the first college and first conservatory in the United States to regularly admit African-American students. Oberlin College's role as an educator of African- American students prior to the Civil War and thereafter is historically significant.Constructing Black Education at Oberlin College Notable is the graduation of William Grant Still, a student who widely became regarded as the \\"dean of African-American composers.\\" These efforts have helped Oberlin remain committed to its values of freedom, social justice, and service.African Americans at Oberlin, Then and Now The College's approach to African Americans was by no means perfect. Nonetheless, Oberlin graduates accounted for a significant percentage of African American College graduates at the end of the 19th Century. The Kohl Building, home of the Jazz and Musicology Departments, opened in 2010 It is also the oldest continuously operating coeducational conservatory, since its incorporation with Oberlin College, the first coeducational college. The college and conservatory were listed as a National Historic Landmark on December 21, 1965, for its significance in social progress. Due to the conservatory's affiliation with Elisha Gray, inventor of the electromechanical oscillator, and Thaddeus Cahill, inventor of the telharmonium, Oberlin Conservatory plays a role in the origins of electronic music. The TIMARA (Technology In Music And Related Arts) program was the world's first conservatory program in this field, established in 1967. Oberlin Conservatory was the recipient of the 2009 National Medal of Arts, the highest award given by the United States government to artists and arts patrons in recognition of the wealth and depth of their creative expressions. The Oberlin Conservatory of Music is the only professional music school to be so honored by President Barack Obama. Admissions Due to the conservatory's affiliation with Oberlin College, students may either enter the conservatory only or Oberlin's five year Double-Degree program, in which the student will complete both a Bachelor of Music degree as well as a Bachelor of Arts. Admission is based primarily on an extremely competitive audition; over 1,400 musicians from around the world apply for a freshman class of around 120. Facilities The conservatory was previously housed in Warner Hall, a large stone building where the King Building now stands. It now occupies four interconnected buildings on the south side of Tappan Square. The original structure of three big white buildings was designed by the Japanese-American architect Minoru Yamasaki in 1963, which closely resembles Yamasaki's later design of the World Trade Center in New York City. In 2010, The Bertram and Judith Kohl Building opened to provide a new home for the Jazz Studies, Music History, and Music Theory departments. Kohl is connected to Robertson by a third-floor enclosed bridge, which also contains the Sky Bar, named for the iconic Cleveland jazz club that closed in 1954. The Robertson Building houses around 150 practice rooms, most with windows. In addition, the Otto B. Schoepfle Vocal Arts Center, Career Resource Center, Kulas Organ Center, reed- making rooms, computer labs, faculty studios, and staff offices are located here. The conservatory contains the largest collection of Steinway & Sons pianos, outside of the Steinway factory, in the world. Programs and departments Warner Concert Hall Bachelor of Music Program (BM): Oberlin Conservatory offers private study in 31 applied areas and undergraduate majors, including a double major in piano performance and vocal accompanying. *Department of Contemporary Music: Composition, Technology In Music And Related Arts (TIMARA), Jazz Studies *Department of Performance: Vocal Performance, Instrumental Music Performance - for piano, organ, flute, clarinet, oboe, trumpet, trombone, bassoon, French horn, tuba, violin, viola, double bass, cello, harp, percussion and guitar. *Department of Historical Performance: Historical Techniques *Department of Musicology: Music Theory, Music History Performance Diploma (PDip): This four-semester program, offered only in certain performance departments, is designed for the very small number of gifted performers who have not yet completed the BM or its equivalent and who are seeking a very narrowly focused program of study leading to a performance-oriented career. Performance Diploma students may apply to transfer to the Bachelor of Music program before the end of the program. Students seeking admission to the BM degree must demonstrate skills necessary to complete both the performance and academic coursework required for the BM. Students who have completed requirements for both the BM and the Performance Diploma will receive only the BM. Master of Music in Conducting (MM): The MM in Conducting is available only as part of five-year programs integrated with an Oberlin Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Performance, Composition, or Music History. Master of Music in Historical Performance (MM): The MM in Performance on Historical Instruments is intended for a limited number of students who have acquired skills on historical instruments and who wish to pursue practical study in performance in combination with the study of performance practice and musicology. Concentrations are offered in harpsichord, fortepiano, organ, Baroque violin, Baroque flute, recorder, Baroque cello/viola da gamba, historical keyboard instruments (harpsichord, fortepiano, and organ, combined), and historical oboes (Baroque, Classical, and other oboes). Students holding an undergraduate degree from another institution will take four semesters to complete the program. Oberlin undergraduates may audition during their junior year for a five-year program which combines the Bachelor of Music degree in a modern instrument with the MM in an historical instrument. Master of Music in Teaching (MMT): The MMT is a fourteen-month degree program leading to teacher licensure and a master's degree in teaching.

Mount Caubvick is the highest point in mainland Canada east of the Rockies. The mountain contains a massive peak that rises sharply from nearby sea level. Craggy ridges, steep cirques and glaciers are prominent features of the peak. The alp was named Mont D'Iberville by the Quebec government in 1971. It remained nameless on the Labrador side for several years; it became known unofficially as L1, L for Labrador and 1 for highest. In 1981, at the suggestion of Dr. Peter Neary, the provincial government named the mountain after Caubvick, one of the five Inuit who accompanied George Cartwright to England in 1772. Mount Caubvick also hosts the highest point in both the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec, although the summit itself lies about northeast of the Quebec provincial border and is entirely within Labrador. Climbing Due to difficult access (either via bush plane or boat) and unpredictable, snowy weather at any time of the year, there is no easy way to the top. The summit can be gained from the east by the Minaret Ridge or to the west by the Koroc Ridge. The final sections on both routes become technical in nature.Mount Caubvick on Peakbagger American climbers Michael Adler and Christopher Goetze were the first to scale the peak in 1973. The first Canadian party climbed the mountain on August 14, 1978. In that party were Ray Chipeniuk, Ron Parker, and Erik Sheer. In August 2003, two climbers from Mississauga, Ontario perished during their descent from the summit. A search was initiated in late August when they failed to meet a plane at a pre-arranged location. The approaching winter weather forced an early end to the search in 2003. In August 2004, their bodies were discovered high up on the mountain. The most plausible scenario appears to be that one of the climbers became injured and was unable to continue the descent. The other climber made an attempt to seek help, taking an alternate route down and apparently fell about 150 feet down a steep headwall.Labrador Tragedy - Recovery at the Summit (Che-Mun, outfit 117) See also *List of highest points of Canadian provinces and territories *List of mountain peaks of North America *Mountain peaks of Canada References External links * Climbing Mount Caubvick and Mont D'Iberville * Mount Caubvick in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia * Peakbagger.com page Category:Labrador Caubvick Category:Landforms of Nord-du-Qu√©bec Caubvick Category:Borders of Quebec Category:Borders of Newfoundland and Labrador Caubvick Caubvick ","title":"Mount Caubvick"},{"id":"645139","text":"A data dictionary, or metadata repository, as defined in the IBM Dictionary of Computing, is a \\"centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format\\".ACM, IBM Dictionary of Computing, 10th edition, 1993 Oracle defines it as a collection of tables with metadata. The term can have one of several closely related meanings pertaining to databases and database management systems (DBMS): * A document describing a database or collection of databases * An integral component of a DBMS that is required to determine its structure * A piece of middleware that extends or supplants the native data dictionary of a DBMS Documentation The terms data dictionary and data repository indicate a more general software utility than a catalogue. A catalogue is closely coupled with the DBMS software. It provides the information stored in it to the user and the DBA, but it is mainly accessed by the various software modules of the DBMS itself, such as DDL and DML compilers, the query optimiser, the transaction processor, report generators, and the constraint enforcer. On the other hand, a data dictionary is a data structure that stores metadata, i.e., (structured) data about information. The software package for a stand-alone data dictionary or data repository may interact with the software modules of the DBMS, but it is mainly used by the designers, users and administrators of a computer system for information resource management. These systems maintain information on system hardware and software configuration, documentation, application and users as well as other information relevant to system administration.Ramez Elmasri, Shamkant B. Navathe: Fundamentals of Database Systems, 3rd. ed. sect. 17.5, p. 582 If a data dictionary system is used only by the designers, users, and administrators and not by the DBMS Software, it is called a passive data dictionary. Otherwise, it is called an active data dictionary or data dictionary. When a passive data dictionary is updated, it is done so manually and independently from any changes to a DBMS (database) structure. With an active data dictionary, the dictionary is updated first and changes occur in the DBMS automatically as a result. Database users and application developers can benefit from an authoritative data dictionary document that catalogs the organization, contents, and conventions of one or more databases.TechTarget, SearchSOA, What is a data dictionary? This typically includes the names and descriptions of various tables (records or Entities) and their contents (fields) plus additional details, like the type and length of each data element. Another important piece of information that a data dictionary can provide is the relationship between Tables. This is sometimes referred to in Entity-Relationship diagrams, or if using Set descriptors, identifying which Sets database Tables participate in. In an active data dictionary constraints may be placed upon the underlying data. For instance, a Range may be imposed on the value of numeric data in a data element (field), or a Record in a Table may be FORCED to participate in a set relationship with another Record-Type. Additionally, a distributed DBMS may have certain location specifics described within its active data dictionary (e.g. where Tables are physically located). The data dictionary consists of record types (tables) created in the database by systems generated command files, tailored for each supported back-end DBMS. Oracle has a list of specific views for the \\"sys\\" user. This allows users to look up the exact information that is needed. Command files contain SQL Statements for CREATE TABLE, CREATE UNIQUE INDEX, ALTER TABLE (for referential integrity), etc., using the specific statement required by that type of database. There is no universal standard as to the level of detail in such a document. Middleware In the construction of database applications, it can be useful to introduce an additional layer of data dictionary software, i.e. middleware, which communicates with the underlying DBMS data dictionary. Such a \\"high- level\\" data dictionary may offer additional features and a degree of flexibility that goes beyond the limitations of the native \\"low-level\\" data dictionary, whose primary purpose is to support the basic functions of the DBMS, not the requirements of a typical application. For example, a high-level data dictionary can provide alternative entity-relationship models tailored to suit different applications that share a common database.U.S. Patent 4774661, Database management system with active data dictionary, 19 November 1985, AT&T; Extensions to the data dictionary also can assist in query optimization against distributed databases.U.S. Patent 4769772, Automated query optimization method using both global and parallel local optimizations for materialization access planning for distributed databases, 28 February 1985, Honeywell Bull Additionally, DBA functions are often automated using restructuring tools that are tightly coupled to an active data dictionary. Software frameworks aimed at rapid application development sometimes include high-level data dictionary facilities, which can substantially reduce the amount of programming required to build menus, forms, reports, and other components of a database application, including the database itself. For example, PHPLens includes a PHP class library to automate the creation of tables, indexes, and foreign key constraints portably for multiple databases.PHPLens, ADOdb Data Dictionary Library for PHP Another PHP-based data dictionary, part of the RADICORE toolkit, automatically generates program objects, scripts, and SQL code for menus and forms with data validation and complex joins.RADICORE, What is a Data Dictionary? For the ASP.NET environment, Base One's data dictionary provides cross-DBMS facilities for automated database creation, data validation, performance enhancement (caching and index utilization), application security, and extended data types.Base One International Corp., Base One Data Dictionary Visual DataFlex featuresVISUAL DATAFLEX,features provides the ability to use DataDictionaries as class files to form middle layer between the user interface and the underlying database. The intent is to create standardized rules to maintain data integrity and enforce business rules throughout one or more related applications. Some industries use generalized data dictionaries as technical standards to ensure interoperability between systems. The real estate industry, for example, abides by a RESO's Data Dictionary to which the National Association of REALTORS mandates its MLSs comply with through its policy handbook. This intermediate mapping layer for MLSs' native databases is supported by software companies which provide API services to MLS organizations. Platform-specific examples Developers use a data description specification (DDS) to describe data attributes in file descriptions that are external to the application program that processes the data, in the context of an IBM System i. The sys.ts$ table in Oracle stores information about every table in the database. It is part of the data dictionary that is created when the Oracle Database is created. Typical attributes Here is a non-exhaustive list of typical items found in a data dictionary for columns or fields: * Entity or form name or their ID (EntityID or FormID). The group this field belongs to. * Field name, such as RDBMS field name * Displayed field title. May default to field name if blank. * Field type (string, integer, date, etc.) * Dimension(s) such as min and max values, display width, or number of decimal places. * Field display order or tab order * Coordinates on screen (if a positional or grid-based UI) * Default value * Prompt type, such as drop-down list, combo-box, check-boxes, range, etc. * Is-required (Boolean) - If 'true', the value can't be blank, null, or only white-spaces * Is-read-only (Boolean) * Reference table name, if a foreign key. Can be used for validation or selection lists. * Various event handlers or references to.

It is the main service town for the agricultural region surrounding the plains of the Rangitaiki River, which flows through the town. It had a population of 1626 in the 2006 New Zealand Census but since then, it has increased to 1,638 as of the 2013 Census. State Highway 2 and the Taneatua Branch railway line (disused) pass through the town. The Edgecumbe Dairy Factory, established in 1915, employs 358 people, roughly a fifth of Edgecumbe's total population. History The town is named after the small village of Edgecumbe in Cornwall, United Kingdom, between Penryn and Helston. Edgecumbe was linked with Tauranga and Auckland by rail, with the opening of the East Coast Main Trunk Railway and Taneatua Express in 1928. In 1987, a large earthquake centered on Edgecumbe shook the Bay of Plenty, causing widespread damage and causing much of the population to leave Edgecumbe. In July 2004, May 2005 and April 2017, the town experienced heavy flooding that ruined many homes. In the 2005 flood, the river swelled to within 5 cm of breaching the flood banks that had been put in place seven years prior. 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake 1987 Earthquake memorial (on right). The earthquake was a major turning point in the history of Edgecumbe. It measured 6.3 on the Richter magnitude scale and struck the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand on 2 March 1987, just after 1.42 pm. The earthquake was very shallow, being centred approximately 8 km from the Earth's surface. The earthquake was one of the most damaging New Zealand's North Island has experienced in recent decades, with approximately 50% of the houses in Edgecumbe being damaged by the quake. There was extensive damage to a local milk factory, with large storage tanks toppled. Kawerau was another nearby town that suffered damage and Whakatane was also badly shaken. An 80-tonne New Zealand Railways DC class locomotive was thrown onto its side. The earthquake caused no fatalities. However, one person died at the time as a result of a heart attack, possibly due to the quake. A foreshock just minutes before had cut the power supply and many people had moved away from heavy machinery and out of their houses. The largest aftershock was measured at 5.2 and struck at 1.52 pm. A crack long opened in the Rangitaiki Plains near Edgecumbe, as a result of the earthquake. It is now known as the 'Edgecumbe Fault'. At one point, the land close to the fault dropped . The epicentre of the quake was approximately south-south-east of the town of Matata, or north-north-west of Edgecumbe. The intense ground- shaking caused by the earthquake led to a large number of ground surface failures, including sand boils, ridge-top shatters and debris avalanches on steeper slopes. Because of the earthquake, many people left and therefore Edgecumbe's population dropped considerably. Edgecumbe is slowly recovering as it has increased by 21 in the years 2006 to 2013, possibly due to many kiwifruit orchards being affected by PSA. 2017 Edgecumbe flood In April 2017, remnants of Cyclone Debbie caused heavy rainfall in the region. At 8:30 am on April 6, water from the Rangitaiki River breached a stopbank next to Edgecumbe, causing widespread flooding across the township. A state of emergency was declared for the Whakatane District, and around 2000 people were evacuated to Kawerau and Whakatane. More than 300 homes were damaged, with some becoming uninhabitable. The largest animal rescue in New Zealand history was recorded during the aftermath of the flood. Approximately 1000 animals were rescued by an SPCA led operation, with support from local civil defence rescue teams and veterinarians from Massey University. The event highlighted a significant gap in animal welfare emergency management capability in New Zealand. Geography Edgecumbe is located inland from the coast on the end of the fertile Rangitaiki Plains. The nearby beach is part of Maketu. The volcanic cone of Mount Edgecumbe, 15 kilometres to the south and close to the town of Kawerau, is visible from Edgecumbe. Clubs and organisations The Association Football Club Plains Rangers AFC is based at the Edgecumbe Domain, along with rugby and hockey. The Edgecumbe Volunteer Fire Brigade is located on SH2 and services the township and surrounding area. The town has a local rugby club, and a Kart Sport track.

In 2006, Beck sponsored an anti-discrimination act in civil law and at the workplace, outlawing discrimination based on race, ethnic origin, sex, sexual identity, religion, age, and disability. On 27 May 2006, Beck was attacked and injured during a Gay Rights demonstration in Moscow, called Moscow Pride. His attack as well as his participation at the Moscow Pride Festival is featured in the documentary Moscow Pride '06. In May 2007 he was arrested and put in a bus in front of Moscow City Hall by the police. He had wanted to hand over a petition signed by several Members of Parliament at Moscow City Hall. He was attacked and had eggs thrown at his head. As in 2007, his partner Jacques Teyssier tried to protect Mr. Beck from attacks by anti gay rights protesters. Alongside fellow MP Marieluise Beck, Volker Beck has been a vocal critic of Russia‚Äôs human rights situation. During his time as his parliamenary group‚Äôs spokesperson on human rights, he described the repeated prison sentences against Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev as \\"disproportionate.\\" He has often urged the German government and the European Union to make unequivocally clear to the Russian government that ‚Äúthe only Russia that can be a strategic partner is one that observes the rule of law.‚Äù He also called on Western investors to ‚Äúput an end to their opportunistic silence.‚ÄùMerkel Condemns Khodorkovsky Sentencing: 'Impression Remains that Political Motives Played a Role' Spiegel Online, December 30, 2010.

Guru Arjan first recited the bani at Gurdwara Barth Sahib in the Gurdaspur district of Punjab, India. Content The composition deals with such topics such as Simran (general meditation that leads to merging with God) and Nam Japna (meditation of Naam), the greatness of Saints and Sadh Sangat (holy congregation), true devotion, doing good deeds, the nature of the mind, the badness of slandering, concepts relating to Bhramvidya, Adviata, Sargun and Nirgun, materialism and death, Hukam, and other similar topics. Below are a few translated lines from the first ashtpadi of the Sukhmani Sahib: Recitation Sukhmani Sahib being recited as a group at Gurdwara Ameerpet, Hyderabad, India. Sukhmani Sahib is frequently recited by Sikhs is one of the popular Banis (compositions of the Guru). It can be done individually or as a group usually in either a place of worship (Gurdwara) or at home. Reciting the entire Sukhmani Sahib takes about 60 to 90 minutes, and is sometimes undertaken by everyone in a smaller congregation with turn by turn reading. Reciting the Gurbani of Sukhmani Sahib is believed to bring peace to one's mind and aid help remembering God constantly. Form Sukhmani Sahib belongs to the Raag Gauri with Gauri meaning pure. The term Sukhmani comprises two words: Sukh (peace) and Mani (the treasure or jewel of the mind) It typically is found in Gutka form (small prayer book). =Structure= Sukhmani Sahib is divided into 24 Ashtpadi (Section). The Ashtpada is the Sanskrit word for a verse that has eight (Asht) metrical feet (pƒÅdi). Before the Ashtpadi begins there is a Salok of two lines and then each Ashtpadi contains eight padas of 10 hymns per pada. History Sukhmani Sahib was composed by Guru Arjandev ji around 1602 before he compiled the Adi Granth. The Guru compiled it at Ramsar Sarovor (Sacred pool), Amritsar which at the time was in thick woods. Prominent Sikh saint Baba Nand Singh would tell Sikhs to recite Sukhmani Sahib twice daily.

The Big Breakfast was produced by Planet 24, the production company co-owned by former Boomtown Rats singer and Band Aid/Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof. The programme was distinctive for broadcasting live from a former lockkeeper's houses, commonly referred to as \\"The Big Breakfast House\\", or more simply, \\"The House\\", located on Fish Island, in Bow in east London. The show was a mix of news, weather, interviews, audience phone-ins and general features, with a light tone which was in competition with the more serious GMTV and even more serious BBC Breakfast programmes. On 25 August 2020 Channel 4 announced the return of the show for a one-off special, after an absence of almost 19 years, to be hosted by comedian Mo Gilligan. History The Big Breakfast was launched at the end of September 1992 to replace The Channel Four Daily, which was Channel 4's unsuccessful first dip into the breakfast television market between 1989 and 1992. The Daily, launched at huge expense, had possessed an analytical style, focusing largely on current affairs, news bulletins and cerebral quiz shows; however, this format had failed to attract enough viewers, and consequently Channel 4 opted to change direction and work towards a lighter style concentrating mainly on entertainment and humour. The first two presenters were Chris Evans (from 1992 to 1994) and Gaby Roslin (1992 to 1996). At its height in 1993, viewing figures reached around two million per edition, and it was the highest rated UK breakfast television programme. Along with Evans and Roslin, Bob Geldof presented a short-lived political interview slot. His wife Paula Yates interviewed people whilst lying on a bed, and the puppet characters Zig and Zag created morning mayhem in the bathroom with Evans in a slot called 'The Crunch'. As part of his contract with The Big Breakfast, Evans was committed to developing a new show for Channel 4. Don't Forget Your Toothbrush began in early 1994, and Evans cut his involvement with The Big Breakfast to three days a week, Tuesday to Thursday. Former Neighbours actor Mark Little replaced Evans on Mondays and Fridays. When Evans left the show later that year, Little continued on Thursdays and Fridays while Paul Ross took over Mondays to Wednesdays. Richard Orford replaced Ross around Easter 1995 but was quickly dropped and exchanged with Down Your Doorstep presenter Keith Chegwin. In July 1995, the show reverted to using just one male presenter throughout the week, Mark Little. Chegwin would cover for Little when he was on tour as a comedian or on holiday. Relaunch Roslin continued full-time until she made way for Zoe Ball in 1996. Audience figures dropped a little after Evans left, and a little further after Roslin departed. Mark Little left the programme in July 1996, following press reports that he and Zoe Ball had fallen out. Little was replaced by Keith Chegwin, who himself exited the programme in August 1996, just ahead of a massive relaunch. In an attempt to stem the sliding viewing figures, the Big Breakfast house was refurbished at a cost of ¬£2 million. New presenters Rick Adams and Sharron Davies were brought in but viewing figures fell dramatically. Davies left the programme in early 1997, to be replaced by Denise van Outen. Van Outen had initially been brought in as part of the September 1996 relaunch as a weather presenter, before being given a role based at the house as the phone room presenter and holiday relief for Davies. In June 1997, Johnny Vaughan covered for Adams for a fortnight alongside Van Outen, the pair forging a successful on screen partnership. Adams left the programme shortly afterwards and, in September 1997, the Vaughan and Van Outen partnership was made permanent. Audience figures stabilised and the duo fronted the programme together until Van Outen's departure on 1 January 1999. (A New Year's Day pre-record). Kelly Brook was installed as Vaughan's new co-presenter despite an internet campaign for the role to be awarded to Liza Tarbuck, who had successfully covered for Van Outen in the summer of 1998. However, Brook struggled in the role and left the programme in early summer 1999. Liza Tarbuck, having again covered the co- presenter role alongside Vaughan prior to Brook's departure, was made permanent at the end of August 1999. She left the following summer and, following Vaughan's annual 1 month summer break, Denise van Outen returned to co-host in September 2000 for Vaughan's final 4 months on the programme. Vaughan and Van Outen's final Big Breakfast was on Friday 12 January 2001, exactly five years to the day since Gaby Roslin had exited. Demise The programme relaunched with a new logo and updated theme on Monday 22 January 2001. The house had also been redecorated in more muted colours, echoing the ill-fated 1996 revamp. The programme moved to a line up of three main presenters, Paul Tonkinson, Amanda Byram and Donna Air. However, Tonkinson was dropped from the programme at the end of March 2001 and Air departed not long after. Richard Bacon and Amanda Byram remained as main presenters, the programme having reverted to two main presenters once more. The living room, which had been repainted a dark red as part of the revamp, was changed to a bright yellow and pink design, while the main presenter chairs were also reinstalled in front of the living room's French windows. They replaced the bright green sofa which had also been brought in as part of the revamp. The new logo was replaced with one more closely resembling the traditional Big Breakfast logo, albeit utilising a slightly different font. Mike McClean was given a role on the programme, as Down Your Doorstep presenter and cover for Bacon, most regularly on Fridays when Bacon would reprise his former Down Your Doorstep role alongside Johnny Vegas. In December 2001 it was announced that The Big Breakfast was to be axed the following March. In the programme's final months, former cover presenter Lisa Rogers was given a role as an extra presenter while Zig and Zag returned for the final six weeks in their former slot, The Crunch, for which a new bathroom set was installed in the house. The final Big Breakfast aired on 29 March 2002 and included a retrospective that included contributions from Evans, Roslin, Vaughan and van Outen. Both Evans and Vaughan declared the cancelling of the show a bad idea. The show ended with a tribute from the Prince of Wales before the last ever Friday song. When the show finished, the house reverted back to a private residence, now known as 'The Cottage'. After renovation following a fire, it has also been used for a number of television shows. Innovations Mark Lamarr, Keith Chegwin, Paul Ross, Richard Orford, Richard Bacon and Mike McClean were \\"down your doorstep\\" outside broadcasters, often turning up live and unannounced at an unsuspecting viewer's house, while rooms within the Lock Keeper's Houses featured the puppets Zig and Zag and video games guru Ben the Boffin. The show's style, with hand-held cameras moving around all of the set, meant that many of the crew members could be seen on screen. This led to them getting nicknames, such as 'Sturdy Girl', who was regularly asked to shake her head so that her hair would be hurled around whilst music played and the camera zoomed in and out. 'The Carpet Monster' was revealed in the Doctor Who Special to have been an extra, playing a deadly clown, in the Seventh Doctor story The Greatest Show in the Galaxy.

This would last throughout the morning, usually until around midday. Although typically presented to the viewer as simply a programme on Channel 4, most of The Bigger Breakfast is perhaps better classified as an informal style of in-vision continuity. The strand also acted as an umbrella brand for the programming which it linked to, by use of Big Breakfast style break-bumpers and Digital On-Screen Graphics. The expanded format always featured the regular content of The Big Breakfast from 7am to 9am. The first run of The Bigger Breakfast during the summer of 1997 was titled as such all the way from its 7am start, presented throughout by Richard Orford and Denise Van Outen. Future editions would see slight separations made from the 7am to 9am content, by way of this portion of the show being branded and scheduled as The Big Breakfast, with all content after 9am taking on the expanded Bigger Breakfast name. After a while, a further distinction was made by using a different set of presenters from that of The Big Breakfast. Presenters of The Bigger Breakfast included Josie D'Arby, Ben Shephard, Melanie Sykes and Dermot O'Leary. Programming was primarily composed of reruns of Channel 4 shows and US imports. The line-up changed frequently. The list below is of some of series featured on The Big Breakfast and the Bigger Breakfast over the years: *Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog *Babylon 5 *Batman *Bewitched *Biker Mice from Mars (1995) *Boy Meets World *Bug Juice *California Dreams *CatDog *City Guys *The Crystal Maze *Dennis *Eerie Indiana *Fantastic Four *Inspector Gadget *Hang Time *Johnny Bravo *Madison *Moesha *The Monkees *Planet Pop *Pugwall's Summer *Renford Rejects *Sam & Max *Saved by the Bell *Sister Sister *The Secret World of Alex Mack The Bigger Breakfast was discontinued after Christmas holidays in 2000. The block of programming provided within The Bigger Breakfast was retained, with Channel 4's youth strand T4 taking over the continuity role. Snap Snap Cackle Pop, a regular and recurring feature throughout the history of The Big Breakfast, was briefly retitled as simply Snap, in 1997. As well as continuing as a short, daily entertainment news feature within The Big Breakfast, Snap also became a show in its own right. Airing once weekly at 6.00pm on Channel 4, the half hour show was a light hearted round-up of recent news stories concerning popular entertainment in the UK. Presented by Denise Van Outen, the show was intentionally recognisable as being closely related to The Big Breakfast, from which it originated and continued to be part of. Snap contained a number of elements synonymous with The Big Breakfast, such as using the very same boudoir set and on-the-bed interviewing of guests. However, care was generally taken not to alienate viewers who were not so familiar with The Big Breakfast. The Big Breakfast End of the Year Show 1992 Three months after first appearing, Chris Evans, Gaby Roslin and Paula Yates hosted a live edition of the show, seeing in the new year of 1993. Zsa Zsa Gabor featured as a special guest. The Biggest Breakfast Ever At 12.30am on 1 January 2000, a mammoth eight-hour live broadcast took place from Lock Keepers' Cottages to herald in the new century. Written by Ged Parsons, John Mann, Giles Boden and Phil Nice, The Biggest Breakfast Ever was hosted by Johnny Vaughan and Liza Tarbuck and featured many classic moments and 'best of' features. Even eight hours of airtime was not enough. The show's producers got Channel 4 to extend its broadcast time by half an hour to fit in the premiere of the competition \\"Wonga\\" (a large-scale version of Jenga). The winner of the game had been told to 'stop steadying the stack' on numerous occasions, but was still allowed to play and eventually won ¬£100,000. It was a prize game that returned to the show many times in its final two years, but never again was anyone allowed to blatantly break the rules of the game. Lock Keepers' Houses Unusually for a live British TV show at the time of its creation, The Big Breakfast was broadcast entirely from a real house. Located alongside the River Lea, in east London, the property became informally known as 'The Big Breakfast House'. Filming would frequently take place within the large grounds of the property and the closely surrounding area. The houses are in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Built in 1947, the property originally comprised three houses which housed the lock keepers, toll takers, and navigation operators of the Old Ford Locks in Bow. By the time of purchase by the programme-makers, Planet24, in 1992, the property had become Grade II listed and had remained unused for around 20 years. Extensive renovation work saw the transformation of the three houses into one large three-bedroom property, specifically fitted for use as a TV studio. The exterior character of the property was largely unchanged. During the first four years of the show, the given address for the house was number 2, Lock Keepers' House. The '2' was later dropped. In 1996, due to the declining popularity of The Big Breakfast, the house was transformed in an art deco- style makeover. The original brickwork was virtually entirely covered over with a smooth rendered finish, painted white. Two large balconies now adorned the front and rear. The only untouched exterior features recognisable from the show's original styling were the four brick chimneys and the roof. The legality of this extensive makeover could be questioned as having broken the rules of by its Grade II listed status. The work carried out is purported to have cost around ¬£2million, largely funded by its sale to the show's broadcaster, Channel Four Television. Structurally, the house largely remained in this style for the remainder of the series. The only notable structural alterations were the removal of the front balcony, the partial removal of the balcony to the rear and minor alterations to the styling of the doors and windows. However, the character of the house was altered through several artistic makeovers to both the interior and exterior. The exterior was painted bright yellow, later a light brown similar in shade to the original brickwork, followed by a faux red brickwork effect which was painted onto the render. The latter style became the final look of the house, during the show's final three-and-a-half years. Houses since The Big Breakfast In November 2002, seven-and-a-half months after The Big Breakfast was axed, a fire destroyed a significant proportion of the first floor of the houses. A large part of the roof was also destroyed in the blaze. The fire was suspicious as there was no gas or electrical supply to the building. Since the fire, extensive work has taken place to restore the house and it is now used as a family home. The house was bought for little more than half the original asking price of ¬£1 million at ¬£550,000. The house was slashed in value because of the fire of November 2002. The house has now been fully renovated, but some of the well- recognised aspects of the house from its use during the run of The Big Breakfast remain. The newly renovated house features in the BBC Two show Neneh and Andi Dish It Up, BBC Three's Singing With the Enemy, and most recently Too Fat To Toddle on ITV1. The houses are located about 200 metres from the site of the main stadium used in the 2012 Olympic Games. In 2005, the houses became part of a compulsory purchase order for the Games, giving rise to speculation that the building may be demolished. However, the houses and gardens remain unchanged. The house made a cameo appearance in a Channel 4 ident shown in the lead-up to the channel's coverage of the Paralympics in August 2012. Question About the Clip Before most advertisement breaks a clip from an upcoming TV show or movie would be shown, a question being asked by one of the hosts about it; the answer would be revealed after the advert break, along with details of the show or film. This feature would result in the production team chorusing \\"Don't phone, it's just for fun!\\" which was a Chris Evans creation, initially used on his radio shows before he shot to fame on The Big Breakfast. Question of the Day A phone-in feature encouraging viewers to provide humorous answers throughout the morning to a pertinent (or occasionally inane) question. At one point it was accompanied by a fanfare, apparently played on the trumpet by \\"little Ted\\" beneath the camera (in fact a member of the team waving a toy trumpet in shot). One morning's question was \\"What should the BBC do to improve EastEnders?\\", and one viewer suggested adding Barbara Windsor to the cast; this actually occurred shortly afterwards. Super Hints \\"Your indispensable guide to a better life!\\", this feature appeared during the early years of the show; in it celebrities would give various simple but useful hints for such issues as cleaning or keeping food fresh. Streaky Bacon \\"Streaky Bacon\\" became a regular feature, in which Richard Bacon would get a member of the public out of their house to 'streak' along their street wearing nothing but bacon-covered underwear in order to win their weight in bacon from their local butcher. Vital Statistics \\"Vital Statistics\\" was another common feature, particularly in the Johnny Vaughan era. These would often relate to a news story, a guest or a topic they had discussed, such as Doctor Who on their Doctor Who Special. On the Bed A key feature for the first five years was the \\"On the Bed\\" interview. Paula Yates (the then wife of Bob Geldof, whose company produced the show), and later Paul O'Grady (as Lily Savage) and Vanessa Feltz assumed the role of interviewer. One of the most infamous on-air moments was Paula Yates' open flirting during an interview with Michael Hutchence as a prelude to their affair. More Tea, Vicar A repeating feature in the Vaughan and van Outen era, in which an erratically filmed, speeded-up video clip of a line of tea cups was shown to a call-in viewer. Vaughan, dressed as an Anglican vicar, and van Outen, dressed as a nun replete with false teeth and an inferiority complex, then explained the rules. The caller guessed the number of tea cups shown in the video lead in, with Vaughan responding \\"More tea, vicar\\" if the number is too low; \\"Less tea, vicar\\" if too high. If the contestant guessed the correct number within the time limit, a prize was awarded. The lyrics to \\"More Tea, Vicar\\" were as follows: :More tea, vicar :More tea, vicar :More tea, vicar :Guess how many cups From Me Shed, Son The inventor of the wind-up radio, Trevor Baylis, would join Johnny Vaughan in the shed to discuss innovative new products. Vaughan tended to make fun of Baylis for being older. Wonga A Jenga-style game, followed by various shouting and anarchy, with fans and the Wonga Lawyer. The show famously went over 27 minutes for a game once, with the Millennium Big Breakfast actually being commissioned with extra time for Wonga. Wonga money The Big Breakfast used to give out \\"wonga money\\" to people when they won money because they didn't want to give it to them on the show. They would give the real thing to them later. The Friday Song Each Friday the two main presenters and the whole crew would gather in the hallway for The Friday Song. The song would look back at events that happened on the show each week The lyrics to the chorus went as follows: 'Singing, wakey, wakey, wakey rise and shine, The big breakfast is the only way to dine, It's your number one big breakie So get it down your neckie, And stick with us from seven until nine!''

Irwin (born September 12, 1928) is an American installation artist who has explored perception and the conditional in art, often through site- specific, architectural interventions that alter the physical, sensory and temporal experience of space. He began his career as a painter in the 1950s, but in the 1960s shifted to installation work, becoming a pioneer whose work helped to define the aesthetics and conceptual issues of the West Coast Light and Space movement. His early works often employed light and veils of scrim to transform gallery and museum spaces, but since 1975, he has also incorporated landscape projects into his practice. Irwin has conceived over fifty-five site-specific projects, at institutions including the Getty Center (1992‚Äì98), Dia:Beacon (1999‚Äì2003), and the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas (2001‚Äì16). The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles mounted the first retrospective of his work in 1993; in 2008, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego presented another, spanning fifty years in his career. Irwin received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1976, a MacArthur Fellowship in March, 1984, and was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2007. He lives and works in San Diego, California. Beginnings Robert Irwin was born in 1928 in Long Beach, California to Robert Irwin and Goldie Anderberg Irwin. After serving in the United States Army from 1946 to 1947, he attended several art institutes: Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles from 1948 to 1950, Jepson Art Institute in 1951, and Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles from 1952 to 1954. He spent the next two years living in Europe and North Africa. Between the years 1957-1958, he taught at the Chouinard Art Institute. thumb\\"Two Running Violet V Forms\\" ‚Äî site-specific sculpture by artist Robert Irwin. Located in the eucalyptus grove behind the Faculty Club at UCSD, San Diego. Part of the on campus Stuart Collection of site specific outdoor sculptures. Work In 1977, Robert Irwin wrote the following about himself: \\"I began as a painter in the middle of nowhere with few questions...My first real question concerned the arbitrariness of my paintings‚Ä¶ I used my paintings as a step-by- step process, each new series of works acting in direct response to those questions raised by the previous series. I first questioned the mark as meaning and then even as focus; I then questioned the frame as containment, the edge as the beginning and end of what I see...consider the possibility that nothing ever really transcends its immediate environment...I tried to respond directly to the quality of each situation I was in, not to change it wholesale into a new or ideal environment, but to attend directly to the nature of how it already was. How is it that a space could ever come to be considered empty when it is filled with real and tactile events?\\" (Robert Irwin, 1977) Robert Irwin's notion of art derived from a series of experiential perceptions. As an abstract, open-minded thinker, he presented experience first as perception or sense. He concluded that a sense of knowing, or ability to identify, helped to clarify perception. For example, \\"We know the sky's blueness even before we know it as \\"blue\\", let alone as \\"sky.\\" He explained later that the conception of an abstract thought occurs in the mind, through the concept of self. Following, the physical form is then recognized, communicating the form to the community. Then, the Objective compound occurs, delineating behavioral norms and artistic norms, becoming identifiable. Then the boundaries and axioms introduce logic and reasoning and decisions can be made: either inductive or deductive. Formalism follows, proving and convincing a decision about the object being perceived. The study done by Irwin suggested that: \\"‚Ä¶all ideas and values have their roots in experience,‚Ä¶ they can be held separate at any point and developed directly on the grounds of function and use, both that they in fact remain relative to the condition of both our subjective and objective being.\\" Robert Irwin's philosophy defined his idea of art as a series of aesthetic inquiries, an opportunity for cultural innovation, a communicative interaction with society, and as compounded historical development. In his book Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees, Lawrence Weschler documents Irwin's process from his early days as a youngster in Southern California to his emergence as a leader in the post- abstraction art world. Weschler describes the mystifying and often enchanting quality of these works in his book's cover notes: :\\"In May 1980, Robert Irwin returned to Market Street in Venice, California to the block where he had kept a studio until 1970, the year he abandoned studio work altogether. Melinda Wyatt was opening a gallery in the building next door to his former work space and invited Irwin to create an installation.\\" :\\"He cleaned out the large rectangular room, adjusted the skylights, painted the walls an even white, and then knocked out the wall facing the street, replacing it with a sheer, semi- transparent white scrim. The room seemed to change its aspect with the passing day: people came and sat on the opposite curb, watching, sometimes for hours at time.\\" :\\"The piece was up for two weeks in one of the more derelict beachfront neighborhoods of Los Angeles: no one so much as laid a hand on it.\\" Because of the ephemeral or subtle nature of his work, this book became not just an introduction but, for many artists and art students, the primary way that Robert Irwin's work was experienced. He told Jori Finkel of the New York Times in 2007 that people still come up to him at lectures for book autographs. In that article, Michael Govan, the director of LACMA who previously commissioned Irwin to \\"design our experience\\" of Dia:Beacon said he believes the book \\"has convinced more young people to become artists than the Velvet Underground has created rockers.\\"Jori Finkel (October 24, 2007), \\"Artist of Space, Light, and Now Trees\\" New York Times. Painting Irwin's early work began with painting. In 1959, he painted a series of hand-held objects and exhibited for the second time, as an individual exhibitor, at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. The following year, 1960, he was asked to exhibit there again as well as at the Pasadena Art Museum. By this time, he began a continuous series of experiments. In 1962, he began teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles and exhibited at the Ferus Gallery again. That year, he began his line paintings. He exhibited at the Ferus Gallery in 1964 and presented a different study, his dot paintings. Between the years 1966-1967, he began painting aluminum discs. He was invited back as an individual exhibitor to The Pace Gallery in New York. In 1968, he began teaching at the University of California, Irvine. For the next two years, he started his work with clear acrylic discs, white convex structures fixed to the wall and illuminated by lamps.Robert Irwin: Untitled, 1968‚Äì69 Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Los Angeles. In 1970, he began his work on \\"Columns\\", a series of clear acrylic columns. In 1972, he began his study on \\"sightlines\\" and \\"places\\" in the Southwest. Light works Irwin first used fluorescent light in the 1970s.Robert Irwin: Cacophonous, April 10, 2015 ‚Äì May 9, 2015 Pace Gallery, New York. His site-conditioned installation Excursus: Homage to the Square3, a meditation on the painter Josef Albers and his explorations of color relationships,Grace Glueck (November 13, 1998), On a Journey Through a Maze, Contemplating Light and Color New York Times. was presented at Dia:Chelsea between 1998 and 2000. It consists of 18 small rooms, divided by walls of tautly stretched scrim; the light in each room, its value depending on the distance from the windows, is enhanced by four white-and-colored double fluorescent bulbs, each hung vertically at the center of each wall.Grace Glueck (November 13, 1998), On a Journey Through a Maze, Contemplating Light and Color New York Times. In 2015, it was reinstalled at Dia:Beacon where it will remain on view through 2017.Robert Irwin: Cacophonous, April 10, 2015 ‚Äì May 9, 2015 Pace Gallery, New York. For a 2015 exhibition at Pace Gallery in New York, he installed rows of columnar lights, coating the different tubes with colored gels that alter the transmission of light.Robert Irwin: Cacophonous, April 10, 2015 ‚Äì May 9, 2015 Pace Gallery, New York. Installations Since 1968Robert Irwin MoMA Collection, New York. Irwin has focused on the site itself by creating installations in rooms, gardens, parks, museums, and various urban locales.\\"Singular Forms (Sometimes Repeated): Art from 1951 to the Present\\", March 5 ‚Äì May 19, 2004 Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Influenced, in particular, by the paintings of John McLaughlin, Irwin and other Light and Space artists became curious about pushing the boundaries of art and perception, in the 1970s Robert Irwin left studio work to pursue installation art that dealt directly with light and space: the basis of visual perception, in both outdoor and modified interior sites. These installations allowed for an open exploration for artist and viewer of an altered experience created by manipulating the context of environment rather than remaining with the confines of an individual work of art. Other artists involved in the Light and Space movement include John McCracken, James Turrell, Peter Alexander, Larry Bell, Craig Kauffman, Doug Wheeler, Maria Nordman, and others. In 1970, the Museum of Modern Art invited Irwin to create an installation. Using the entire project space, Irwin suspended a white scrim 10 feet from the ground and attached shimmering stainless steel wires to the wall. In 1971 the Walker Art Center commissioned the artist to create Untitled (Slant/Light/Volume) for the inaugural exhibition of its Edward Larrabee Barnes-designed building.Robert Irwin: Slant/Light/Value, August 6, 2009 - February 28, 2010 Walker Art Center. For Soft Wall, a 1974 installation at Pace Gallery in New York, Irwin simply cleaned and painted a rectangular gallery and hung a thin, translucent white theater scrim eighteen inches in front of one of the long walls, creating the effect of an empty room in which one wall seemed permanently out of focus.Robert Irwin Dia:Beacon. A permanent wall installation in the entrance corridor of the Allen Memorial Art Museum, the dimensions of Untitled (1980) exactly repeat those of the deep-set windows just opposite.Robert Irwin: Untitled, 1980 Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin. In the early 1980s, Irwin was invited to participate as a collaborating artist in designs for the rejuvenation and improvement of the Miami International Airport. In 1997 he transformed a room that overlooks the Pacific at the La Jolla branch of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego.Jori Finkel (October 14, 2007), Artist of Light, Space and, Now, Trees New York Times. To celebrate its 125th anniversary, the Indianapolis Museum of Art commissioned Irwin to create Light and Space III (2008), thereby becoming the first American museum to have a permanent indoor installation of the artist. For the piece, Irwin arranged fluorescent light bulbs in an irregular grid pattern across the walls surrounding the escalators, with a veil of scrim framing each side; as museum visitors go up and down between floors, they move through the piece.Robert Irwin: Light and Space III, 2008 Indianapolis Museum of Art. Trifecta (Joe's Bar & Grill), a three-story permanent light installation at Swiss Re's corporate headquarters in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was inaugurated in 2012. In late 2013, a 33-foot-tall acrylic column by Irwin was unveiled at the San Diego Federal Courthouse, where the artist worked with his longtime friends and collaborators, architect Martin Poirer and landscape architect Andrew Spurlock, on the courthouse's outdoor plaza. The three-story-tall acrylic column, built decades ago but never given a proper home due to a series of unforeseen circumstances, refracts light and cast colors as the sun moves through the lobby.Robert Irwin - Dotting the i's & Crossing the t's: Part II, September 6 ‚Äì October 20, 2012 Pace Gallery, New York. The fabrication of the columns and the technical issues related to the material, were all executed by Jack Brogan, a central character in the evolution of the techniques in the Light and Space Movement. The challenge and technique of polishing the columns to the required transparency was invented by Brogan and remains a high water mark in the field.Artist Robert Irwin‚Äôs linear configuration is composed of 66 fluorescent tubes. The work stretches to a length of approximately 36 feet and can be experienced both from within and beyond the gallery walls. For the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Irwin created an outdoor installation of primal palm trees (Primal Palm Garden, 2008-2010) as well as an indoor 36-foot-long fluorescent light sculpture, Miracle Mile (2013), which glows behind them 24 hours a day.Carol Kino (December 31, 2015), The Artist‚Äôs Artist: Robert Irwin Continues to Create and Inspire WSJ.

Landscape projects Irwin moved on to landscape projects after developing a stylistic move towards experiential space, projecting what he learned about line, color, and most of all, light onto the built environment. Since 1975 Irwin has conceived of fifty-five site projects. 9 Spaces 9 Trees (1980‚Äì3) originally was commissioned in 1980 for the rooftop of the Public Safety Building by the Seattle Arts Commission; it was re-imagined in 2007 and sited on campus at the University of Washington. Irwin's Filigreed Line (1979) made for Wellesley College, Massachusetts, consists of a stainless steel line, running along a ridge of grass near a lake, in which a pattern of leaflike forms is cut. His 1983 work Two Running Violet V Forms, two crossing blue-violet, plastic coated wire fences fixed with high poles, is featured as part of the Stuart Collection of public artwork on the campus of the University of California, San Diego. For Sentinel Plaza (1990) in the Pasadena Civic Center District, Irwin chose small desert plants and cacti. He later consulted on the master plan for Dia:Beacon, creating, in particular, the design and landscaping of the outdoor spaces, and the entrance building and the window design.Robert Irwin Dia Art Foundation. He later designed and developed the Central Garden at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, built in 1997. In the Central Garden, Irwin's concept of integrating experiential relationships to the built environment is abundantly clear. Those experiential elements fill the space. This project is widely praised for its design and flow. The design features a natural ravine and tree-lined walkway that leads the visitor through an experience of sights, sounds, and scents. He selected everything in the garden to accentuate the interplay of light, color, and reflection. Planning began in 1992, as a key part of the Getty Center project. Since the Center opened in 1997, the Central Garden has evolved as its plants have grown. Irwin's statement, \\"Always changing, never twice the same,\\" is carved into the plaza floor, reminding visitors of the ever-changing nature of this living work of art. To the artist's dismay, a 1950s Fernand L√©ger sculpture was placed on the garden's plaza.Paula Panich (July 24, 2008), Robert Irwin still marvels at Getty gardens 10 years later Los Angeles Times. Irwin recently completed the second phase of the installation of a primordial Palm Garden at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art which began in 2007.Robert Irwin: Way Out West, November 12, 2010‚ÄîJanuary 29, 2011 ARTINFO. The Palm Garden is arranged in a \\"T\\" shape with the east-west axis running between and around, both the Broad Contemporary Art Museum and the Resnick Pavilion. The north-south axis terminates with a grid of date palms serving as a counterpoint to artist Chris Burden's Urban Light installation. Irwin has long been intrigued with how palm trees capture and reflect Southern California light; designing the Palm Garden provided Irwin with an opportunity to work with both the phenomenal and cultural perceptions of palms. Individual species of palms are planted in Cor- Ten boxes, modern and formalized versions of common wood nursery boxes. The sculptural containers make reference to the pedestal bases traditionally signifying art objects. Irwin's use of palm trees considers the ubiquitous and iconic connection between the palm tree and images of Los Angeles. Exhibitions Irwin first exhibited paintings at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1957. The exhibit was called \\"Artists of Los Angeles and Vicinity.\\" The same year, he participated in the 57th Annual Exhibition of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. That same year, he had his first individual exhibition at the Felix Landau Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1965, he participated in an exhibition called The Responsive Eye at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at another called XIII in Bienal de S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In 1966, he exhibited both as an individual and with Kenneth Price at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and as an individual exhibitor later at The Pace Gallery in New York. In 1969, Irwin exhibited with Doug Wheeler at the Fort Worth Art Center in Fort Worth, Texas. In 1970, he first exhibited scrim \\"volumes\\" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. For the next five years, he exhibited individually at the following locations: the Pace Gallery in New York, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Minuzo and Ace Galleries in Los Angeles, the Fogg Art Museum on the Harvard Campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, the University of California at Santa Barbara, Fort Worth Art Center, and Palomar College in San Marcos, California. He participated in several joint exhibitions: \\"Transparency, Reflection, Light, Space: Four Artists\\" at the UCLA Art Gallery in Los Angeles and \\"Some Recent American Art\\" at the Museum of Modern Art exhibition for Australia. He also exhibited internationally: \\"Kompas IV\\" at Stedelijk Museum in Eindhoven, with other artists, Bell and Wheeler, at the Tate Gallery in London, and Documenta at Kassel in Germany. In 1993, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles mounted the first comprehensive retrospective of Irwin's career; the exhibition later traveled to the K√∂lnischer Kunstverein, the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a.Robert Irwin, June 20 - August 15, 1993 Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Los Angeles. In 2008, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego presented another comprehensive retrospective spanning fifty years of Irwin's career. Recognition Irwin was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1984, making him the first artist to receive the five-year fellowship, which lasted until 1989. He has also been the recipient of a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship (1976), the Chaloner award, the James D. Phelan award (1954), and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation medal in architecture awarded by the University of Virginia School of Architecture (2009). He holds Honorary Doctorates from the San Francisco Art Institute (1979) and the Otis College of Art and Design (1992). Irwin was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2007. That same year he had a residency at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego.Robert Irwin: Light and Space, 2007 Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. Collections Irwin's work is held in more than 30 public collections worldwide, including the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid, Spain; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Solomon R.

It shelters a large area of low-lying land, Romney Marsh. Dungeness spans Dungeness Nuclear Power Station, the hamlet of Dungeness, and an ecological site at the same location. It lies within the civil parish of Lydd. Etymology The name Dungeness derives from Old Norse ('headland'), with the first part probably connected with the nearby Denge Marsh. Popular etymology ascribes a French origin to the toponym, giving an interpretation as \\"dangerous nose\\". Nature Ecology Dungeness is one of the largest expanses of shingle in Europe. It is of international conservation importance for its geomorphology, plant and invertebrate communities and bird life. This is recognised and protected mostly through its conservation designations as a national nature reserve (NNR), a Special Protection Area (SPA), a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and part of the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of Dungeness, Romney Marsh and Rye Bay. There is a remarkable variety of wildlife living at Dungeness, with over 600 different types of plant: a third of all those found in Britain. It is one of the best places in Britain to find invertebrates such as moths, bees, beetles, and spiders; many of these are very rare, some found nowhere else in Britain. The short-haired bumblebee, Bombus subterraneus, was last found in the UK in 1988 but has survived in New Zealand after being shipped there more than 100 years ago. After unsuccessful attempts to reintroduce the New Zealand bees at Dungeness in 2009‚Äì2010, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Hymettus, Natural England and the RSPB teamed up with the Swedish government in a second attempt and introduced 51 of them in 2012 and 49 in 2013 to the Dungeness Reserve. This will be continued each year to ensure a successful integration. The flooded gravel pits on Denge Beach, both brackish and fresh water, provide an important refuge for many migratory and coastal bird species. The RSPB has a bird reserve there, and every year thousands of bird watchers visit the peninsula and its bird observatory. One of the most remarkable features of the site is an area known as \\"the patch\\" or, by anglers, as \\"the boil\\". The waste hot water from the Dungeness nuclear power stations is pumped into the sea through two outfall pipes, enriching the biological productivity of the sea bed and attracting seabirds from miles around. Beach fishing is popular at Dungeness, with the area being a nationally recognised cod fishing venue in the winter. The Dungeness area will potentially be affected by plans to lengthen the runway of Lydd Airport to accommodate larger passenger jets. It has previously been reported that Dungeness had such low rainfall as to qualify as the only desert in the UK. However, a spokesperson for the Met Office refuted this in 2015. Climate The climate in Dungeness is mild and generally warm and temperate. There is significant rainfall throughout the year. The average annual temperature is . Precipitation averages annually. The K√∂ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \\"Cfb\\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate). Buildings Lighthouses Lighthousemen's Dwellings made from the first two storeys of the 1792 lighthouse after the 1904 lighthouse replaced it There have been seven lighthouses at Dungeness, five high and two low, with the fifth high one still fully operational today. At first, only a beacon was used to warn sailors, but this was replaced by a wooden lighthouse in 1615 which was tall. As the sea retreated, this had to be replaced in 1635 by a new lighthouse nearer to the water's edge known as Lamplough's Tower which was around 110 ft high. As more shingle was thrown up, a new and more up-to-date lighthouse was built near the sea in 1792 by Samuel Wyatt. This lighthouse was high and of the same design as the third Eddystone Lighthouse. From the mid-19th century, it was painted black with a white band to make it more visible in daylight; similar colours have featured on the subsequent lighthouses here. This lighthouse was demolished in 1904, but the lighthouse keepers' accommodation, built in a circle around the base of the tower, still exists. In 1901 building of the fourth lighthouse, the High Light Tower, started. It was first lit on 31 March 1904 and still stands today. It is no longer in use as a lighthouse but is open as a visitor attraction. It is a circular brick structure, high and in diameter at ground level. It has 169 steps and gives visitors a good view of the shingle beach. As the sea receded further, and after building the nuclear power station which obscured the light of the 1904 lighthouse, a fifth lighthouse, Dungeness Lighthouse was built. Power stations Dungeness B. There are two nuclear power stations at Dungeness, identified as \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", the first built in 1965 and the second in 1983. They are within a wildlife sanctuary designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and birds flourish in the warmer water created by the station's outflow. The older power station closed on 31 December 2006, while the newer station has had its licence extended to 2028. It is now owned and operated by EDF Energy. There is a public visitors centre, and tours of \\"B\\" station are available. Tours were stopped in 2001, and the visitor centre subsequently closed in 2003, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. EDF opened a new visitor centre in 2013 and resumed tours, albeit with new security procedures which have to be cleared some weeks in advance of visits. The hamlet Prospect Cottage, Dungeness in 2004 In addition to the power station and lighthouse, there is a collection of dwellings. Most are wooden weatherboard beach houses, but there are also around 30 houses converted from old railway coaches in the 1920s. These houses are owned and occupied by fishermen whose boats lie on the beach. Closer to the main road, there is a large building ‚Äì comprising five conjoined homes ‚Äì previously tenanted by coastguards. There are more houses around the site of the power stations. There are two public houses: the Britannia and the Pilot, the latter being served by the Pilot Inn railway station from 1928 to 1977. Fresh seafood can be purchased from several outlets across the shingle. A notable house is Prospect Cottage, formerly owned by the late artist and film director Derek Jarman. The cottage is painted black, with a poem, part of John Donne's \\"The Sunne Rising\\", written on one side in black lettering. The garden, reflecting the bleak, windswept landscape of the peninsula, is made of pebbles, driftwood, scrap metal and a few hardy plants. Transport Dungeness is accessible by two roads, one along the coast from New Romney to the north, and another from Lydd to the north-west. Both roads converge near the Pilot public house, from where a single road runs a mile (1.6 km) south to the tip of Dungeness. Dungeness is also served by the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway, a gauge light railway that covers the distance from Hythe. The line, which had opened to New Romney in 1927, was extended to Dungeness station a year later. It still provides a service for tourists. The peninsula has a second, standard gauge railway, but this is now truncated at Lydd and only used to carry waste from the power stations. It formerly linked Dungeness (and, via a separate branch, New Romney) to a junction with the Marshlink Line at Appledore. The Dungeness section was closed to passengers on 4 July 1937 and it was truncated to Lydd on 6 March 1967. Lydd Airport, sometimes known as London Ashford Airport, lies just to the north-west of Dungeness. Despite opposition, largely due to its proximity to the unique landscape of Dungeness, the airport received permission in 2014 to extend its runway to allow it to handle fully loaded aircraft up to the size of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A319. Defence uses Acoustic mirrors at RAF Denge The beach and marshes have been used for military training and include marked \\"danger areas\\". Denge, a former Royal Air Force site at the northern edge of the Dungeness headland, is the site of a set of acoustic mirrors, known as the \\"Listening Ears\\". Built between 1928 and 1930, the three massive concrete structures formed an experimental early warning system that aimed to detect invading aircraft by focusing sound waves. The site was chosen as being one of the quietest in Britain. Their different forms are evidence of their experimental nature; they were not particularly effective and were abandoned when radar became available. The site is now managed by the RSPB. In 1944 some of the world's first submarine oil pipelines were laid between Dungeness and France in Operation Pluto. The lines from Dungeness were part of a network called Dumbo and ran to Ambleteuse in France. Media appearances Dungeness appears quite often in music videos, album covers and adverts. It featured on the cover of Pink Floyd's 1981 album A Collection of Great Dance Songs. British band The Soup Dragons shot the videos for their top 5 1990 hit '\\"I'm Free\\", and follow- up top 20 1991 hit \\"Mother Universe\\" on Dungeness; and there have also been several photo shoots by the band in the area. The shingle beach and fishermen's shacks feature extensively in the Lighthouse Family promotional video for their 1998 song \\"High\\". The acoustic mirror at Dungeness is featured on the cover of the album Ether Song by the British indie band Turin Brakes. Dungeness appears on the covers of albums as diverse as So much for the city by The Thrills and Aled by Aled Jones. The Prodigy's single \\"Invaders Must Die\\" video was filmed here and shows both the acoustic mirrors and the lighthouse. In 2011, the music video for the song Walk the River by British band Guillemots was filmed on the headland. In 2012, Nicki Minaj's single Freedom was filmed on the beach and with the acoustic mirrors. The music video for Lithuanian DJ Ten Walls' hit single Walking With Elephants was shot on the headland and in the surrounding sea and featured many of the areas prominent landmarks. In 2016, The Wholls also filmed the music video for their single \\"X21\\". In 2020, the music video for Nothing But Thieves's single Impossible was partly filmed on the beach. Athlete have a song on the album Vehicles and Animals called \\"Dungeness\\" which is about the area. Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly mentions Dungeness and the lighthouse in his song \\"Lighthouse Keeper\\". The Kent-based hardcore punk band November Coming Fire released a 2006 album entitled Dungeness, featuring a track called \\"Powerstation\\" which included a recording of waves on the beach, and Scottish folk band Trembling Bells named their album Dungeness too. In television, the Dungeness landscape, the lighthouse and the power station have been used on digital channel E4 at the beginning and end of advertising breaks. It was used as a backdrop for the ITV drama The Poison Tree. It featured in an episode of the BBC detective serial The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and in March 2007 was the setting for a major part of an EastEnders special. The BBC filmed episodes of Doctor Who in Dungeness during the 1970s. The 1981 fantasy film Time Bandits shot its \\"Time of Legends\\" sequence on the beach, and Dungeness was used to film a scene in Danny Boyle's Trance. Much of the Michael Winterbottom's 1998 film I Want You was set in and around Dungeness: the lead character's home was one of the wooden beach huts. The Derek Jarman avant-garde 1990 film The Garden was set and filmed in Dungeness.

Origin When Disneyland opened in 1955, visitors purchased an admission ticket to the park at the main gate booths and then purchased separate admission inside for each attraction. Less than three months after opening, Disney began selling \\"Value Books\\", each of which contained several of each coupon labeled \\"A\\" through \\"C\\", to supplement the pay-per-ride system. Attractions were then designated as \\"A\\", \\"B\\", or \\"C\\" attractions, and visitors needed to either purchase a specified coupon from a nearby booth or present the discount coupon book with the correct coupon attached. As determined by Disney, \\"A\\" attractions were the smallest or least popular, \\"B\\" attractions were more popular and/or more advanced, and \\"C\\" attractions were the most popular and/or most advanced. In 1956, Disney introduced the \\"D\\" designation for the most popular attractions and upgraded several former \\"C\\" attractions including Jungle Cruise to \\"D\\". In June 1959, amid the completion of Disneyland's first major expansion, Disney introduced the \\"E\\" designation for the park's most popular attractions and made the new Submarine Voyage, Matterhorn Bobsleds, and Disneyland‚ÄìAlweg Monorail \\"E\\" coupon attractions. Additionally, the Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad, Rocket to the Moon, Rainbow Ridge Pack Mules, Rainbow Mountain Stage Coaches, Mark Twain Riverboat, Sailing Ship Columbia, Rafts to Tom Sawyer Island, and Jungle Cruise ‚Äì all previously \\"D\\" rides ‚Äì were upgraded to \\"E\\". \\"E\\" remained the highest attraction/coupon designation for over 20 years. Several \\"E\\" attractions were added throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1971 the coupon system was duplicated at the Magic Kingdom when it opened. The coupons had a face value for use on rides, with an \\"A\\" ticket worth $0.10, \\"B\\" $0.15, \\"C\\" $0.25, \\"D\\" $0.50, and \\"E\\", $0.85. This meant one could ride any ride if the ticket or a combination of tickets met or exceeded the value of that ride, so one could overpay an \\"A\\" ticket ride with a \\"B\\" ticket or higher, or present an \\"A\\", \\"C\\", and \\"D\\" ticket together instead of an \\"E\\" ticket. The coupon system was gradually phased out with the introduction of unlimited use tickets beginning in the late 1970s. This was largely due to competition from Six Flags Magic Mountain, which, when it opened in 1971, allowed its visitors unlimited use of its attractions after paying the admission fee. By June 1982 coupons vanished entirely and were replaced by the present-day system where main gate admission entitles visitors to all rides and attractions, excluding coin-operated arcades. Modern usage From 1997 to 2004,Walt Disney World - Disney World Vacation Information Guide - INTERCOT - Walt Disney World Inside & Out - Theme Parks Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom hosted \\"hard ticket\\" special eventsThe general public and annual pass holders must purchase additional tickets to attend \\"Specially Ticketed Events\\". called E-Ride Nights, where a limited number of resort room guests (usually 5,000) were allowed to purchase special tickets that allowed them to stay in the park and ride some of the rides (typically those that had been, or would have been, E ticket rides) for an extra three hours after the park had closed to other guests.

It was conceivedCopenhagen Consensus 2004 ‚Äì addresses 10 major challenges in the world. ‚Äì The Basic Idea and organized by Bj√∏rn Lomborg, the author of The Skeptical Environmentalist and the then director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute. The project is run by the Copenhagen Consensus Center,http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com Copenhagen Consensus Center ‚Äì CCC Home Page which is directed by Lomborg and was part of the Copenhagen Business School, but it is now an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation registered in the USA. The project considers possible solutions to a wide range of problems, presented by experts in each field. These are evaluated and ranked by a panel of economists. The emphasis is on rational prioritization by economic analysis. The panel is given an arbitrary budget constraint and instructed to use cost‚Äìbenefit analysis to focus on a bottom line approach in solving/ranking presented problems. The approach is justified as a corrective to standard practice in international development, where, it is alleged, media attention and the \\"court of public opinion\\" results in priorities that are often far from optimal. History The project has held conferences in 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. The 2012 conference ranked bundled micronutrient interventions the highest priority, and the 2008 report identified supplementing vitamins for undernourished children as the world‚Äôs best investment.Copenhagen Consensus 2008 ‚Äì The world‚Äôs best investment: Vitamins for undernourished children The 2009 conference, dealing specifically with global warming, proposed research into marine cloud whitening (ships spraying seawater into clouds to make them reflect more sunlight and thereby reduce temperature) as the top climate change priority, though climate change itself is ranked well below other world problems. In 2011 the Copenhagen Consensus Center carried out the Rethink HIV project together with the RUSH Foundation, to find smart solutions to the problem of HIV/AIDS. In 2007 looked into which projects would contribute most to welfare in Copenhagen Consensus for Latin America in cooperation with the Inter-American Development Bank. The initial project was co-sponsored by the Danish government and The Economist. A book summarizing the Copenhagen Consensus 2004 conclusions, Global Crises, Global Solutions, edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by Cambridge University Press, followed by the second edition published in 2009 based on the 2008 conclusions. The book containing the Copenhagen Consensus 2012 research and outcomes is in the process of publication. Copenhagen Consensus 2012 In May 2012, the third global Copenhagen ConsensusCopenhagen Consensus 2012 was held, gathering economists to analyze the costs and benefits of different approaches to tackling the world‚Äòs biggest problems. The aim was to provide an answer to the question: If you had $75bn for worthwhile causes, where should you start? A panel including four Nobel laureates met in Copenhagen, Denmark, in May 2012. The panel‚Äôs deliberations were informed by thirty new economic research papers that were written just for the project by scholars from around the world.  Economists  The panel members were the following, four of whom are Nobel Laureate economists. * Robert Mundell * Nancy Stokey * Thomas Schelling * Vernon Smith * Finn Kydland  Challenges  * Armed conflict * Biodiversity * Chronic Disease * Climate Change * Education * Hunger and Malnutrition * Infectious Disease * Natural Disasters * Population Growth * Water and Sanitation In addition, the Center commissioned research on Corruption and Trade Barriers, but the Expert Panel did not rank these for Copenhagen Consensus 2012, because the solutions to these challenges are political rather than investment-related.  Outcome  Given the budget restraints, they found 16 investments worthy of investment (in descending order of desirability): # Bundled micronutrient interventions to fight hunger and improve education # Expanding the Subsidy for Malaria Combination Treatment # Expanded Childhood Immunization Coverage # Deworming of Schoolchildren, to improve educational and health outcomes # Expanding Tuberculosis Treatment # R&D; to Increase Yield Enhancements, to decrease hunger, fight biodiversity destruction, and lessen the effects of climate change # Investing in Effective Early Warning Systems to protect populations against natural disaster # Strengthening Surgical Capacity # Hepatitis B Immunization # Using Low‚ÄêCost Drugs in the case of Acute Heart Attacks in poorer nations (these are already available in developed countries) # Salt Reduction Campaign to reduce chronic disease # Geo‚ÄêEngineering R&D; into the feasibility of solar radiation management # Conditional Cash Transfers for School Attendance # Accelerated HIV Vaccine R&D; # Extended Field Trial of Information Campaigns on the Benefits From Schooling # Borehole and Public Hand Pump Intervention  Slate ranking  During the days of the Copenhagen Consensus 2012 conference, a series of articles was published in Slate Magazine each about a challenge that was discussed, and Slate readers could make their own ranking, voting for the solutions which they thought were best. Slate readers' ranking corresponded with that of the Expert Panel on many points, including the desirability of bundled micronutrient intervention; however, the most striking difference was in connection with the problem of overpopulation. Family planning ranked highest on the Slate priority list, whereas it didn't feature in the top 16 of the Expert Panel's prioritisation.

Smith (¬§) * Thomas Schelling (¬§) * Nancy Stokey Results In the Copenhagen Consensus 2008, the solutions for global problems have been ranked in the following order:Copenhagen Consensus 2008 # Micronutrient supplements for children (vitamin A and zinc) # The Doha development agenda # Micronutrient fortification (iron and salt iodization) # Expanded immunization coverage for children # Biofortification # Deworming and other nutrition programs at school # Lowering the price of schooling # Increase and improve girls‚Äô schooling # Community-based nutrition promotion # Provide support for women‚Äôs reproductive role # Heart attack acute management # Malaria prevention and treatment # Tuberculosis case finding and treatment # R&D; in low-carbon energy technologies # Bio-sand filters for household water treatment # Rural water supply # Conditional cash transfer # Peace-keeping in post-conflict situations # HIV combination prevention # Total sanitation campaign # Improving surgical capacity at district hospital level # Microfinance # Improved stove intervention to combat Air Pollution # Large, multipurpose dam in Africa # Inspection and maintenance of diesel vehicles # Low sulfur diesel for urban road vehicles # Diesel vehicle particulate control technology # Tobacco tax # R&D; and carbon dioxide emissions reduction # Carbon dioxide emissions reduction Unlike the 2004 results, these were not grouped into qualitative bands such as Good, Poor, etc. Gary Yohe, one of the authors of the global warming paper, subsequently accused Lomborg of \\"deliberate distortion of our conclusions\\", adding that \\"as one of the authors of the Copenhagen Consensus Project's principal climate paper, I can say with certainty that Lomborg is misrepresenting our findings thanks to a highly selective memory\\". K√•re Fog further pointed out that the future benefits of emissions reduction were discounted at a higher rate than for any of the other 27 proposals,http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/CopCons2008.htm stating \\"so there is an obvious reason why the climate issue always is ranked last\\" in Lomborg's environmental studies. In a subsequent joint statement settling their differences, Lomborg and Yohe agreed that the \\"failure\\" of Lomborg's emissions reduction plan \\"could be traced to faulty design\\". Climate Change Project In 2009, the Copenhagen Consensus established a Climate Change Project specifically to examine solutions to climate change. The process was similar to the 2004 and 2008 Copenhagen Consensus, involving papers by specialists considered by a panel of economists. The panel ranked 15 solutions, of which the top 5 were: # Research into marine cloud whitening (involving ships spraying sea-water into clouds so as to reflect more sunlight and thereby reduce temperatures) # Technology-led policy response # Research into stratospheric aerosol injection (involving injected ?sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to reduce sunlight) # Research into carbon storage # Planning for adaptation The benefits of the number 1 solution are that if the research proved successful this solution could be deployed relatively cheaply and quickly. Potential problems include environmental impacts e.g. from changing rainfall patterns. Measures to cut carbon and methane emissions, such as carbon taxes, came bottom of the results list, partly because they would take a long time to have much effect on temperatures. Copenhagen Consensus 2004  Process  Eight economists met May 24‚Äì28, 2004 at a roundtable in Copenhagen. A series of background papers had been prepared in advance to summarize the current knowledge about the welfare economics of 32 proposals (\\"opportunities\\") from 10 categories (\\"challenges\\"). For each category, one assessment article and two critiques were produced. After a closed-door review of the background papers, each of the participants gave economic priority rankings to 17 of the proposals (the rest were deemed inconclusive).  Economists  Nobel Prize winners marked with (¬§) * Jagdish Bhagwati * Robert Fogel (¬§) * Bruno Frey * Justin Yifu Lin * Douglass North (¬§) * Thomas Schelling (¬§) * Vernon L. Smith (¬§) * Nancy Stokey  Challenges  Below is a list of the 10 challenge areas and the author of the paper on each. Within each challenge, 3‚Äì4 opportunities (proposals) were analyzed: Preventing spread of HIV * Communicable diseases (Anne Mills) * Conflicts (Paul Collier) * Education (Lant Pritchett) * Financial instability (Barry Eichengreen) * Global Warming sometimes also called Climate change (William R. Cline) * Government and corruption (Susan Rose-Ackerman) * Malnutrition and hunger (Jere Behrman) * Population: migration (Phillip L. Martin) * Sanitation and water (Frank Rijsberman) * Subsidies and trade barriers (Kym Anderson)  Results  The panel agreed to rate seventeen of the thirty-two opportunities within seven of the ten challenges. The rated opportunities were further classified into four groups: Very Good, Good, Fair and Bad; all results are based using cost‚Äìbenefit analysis. =Very good= The highest priority was assigned to implementing certain new measures to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS. The economists estimated that an investment of $27 billion could avert nearly 30 million new infections by 2010. Policies to reduce malnutrition and hunger were chosen as the second priority. Increasing the availability of micronutrients, particularly reducing iron deficiency anemia through dietary supplements, was judged to have an exceptionally high ratio of benefits to costs, which were estimated at $12 billion. Control malaria Third on the list was trade liberalization; the experts agreed that modest costs could yield large benefits for the world as a whole and for developing nations. The fourth priority identified was controlling and treating malaria; $13 billion costs were judged to produce very good benefits, particularly if applied toward chemically-treated mosquito netting for beds.Search ‚Äì International Herald Tribune =Good= The fifth priority identified was increased spending on research into new agricultural technologies appropriate for developing nations. Three proposals for improving sanitation and water quality for a billion of the world‚Äôs poorest followed in priority (ranked sixth to eighth: small-scale water technology for livelihoods, community-managed water supply and sanitation, and research on water productivity in food production). Completing this group was the 'government' project concerned with lowering the cost of starting new businesses. =Fair= Ranked tenth was the project on lowering barriers to migration for skilled workers. Eleventh and twelfth on the list were malnutrition projects ‚Äì improving infant and child nutrition and reducing the prevalence of low birth weight. Ranked thirteenth was the plan for scaled-up basic health services to fight diseases. =Poor= Ranked fourteenth to seventeenth were: a migration project (guest-worker programmes for the unskilled), which was deemed to discourage integration; and three projects addressing climate change (optimal carbon tax, the Kyoto Protocol and value-at-risk carbon tax), which the panel judged to be least cost-efficient of the proposals.  Global warming  The panel found that all three climate policies presented have \\"costs that were likely to exceed the benefits\\". It further stated \\"global warming must be addressed, but agreed that approaches based on too abrupt a shift toward lower emissions of carbon are needlessly expensive.\\" http://copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/CC04-final_result.pdf In regard to the science of global warming, the paper presented by Cline relied primarily on the framework set by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and accepted the consensus view on global warming that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the primary cause of the global warming. Cline relies on various research studies published in the field of economics and attempted to compare the estimated cost of mitigation policies against the expected reduction in the damage of the global warming. Cline used a discount rate of 1.5%. (Cline's summary is on the project webpage Copenhagen Consensus 2004 ‚Äì addresses 10 major challenges in the world. ‚Äì Climate Change) He justified his choice of discount rate on the ground of \\"utility-based discounting\\", that is there is zero bias in terms of preference between the present and the future generation (see time preference). Moreover, Cline extended the time frame of the analysis to three hundred years in the future. Because the expected net damage of the global warming becomes more apparent beyond the present generation(s), this choice had the effect of increasing the present-value cost of the damage of global warming as well as the benefit of abatement policies.  Criticism  Members of the panel including Thomas Schelling and one of the two perspective paper writers Robert O. Mendelsohn (both opponents of the Kyoto protocol) criticised Cline, mainly on the issue of discount rates. (See \\"The opponent notes to the paper on Climate Change\\" ) Mendelsohn, in particular, characterizing Cline's position, said that \\"[i]f we use a large discount rate, they will be judged to be small effects\\" and called it \\"circular reasoning, not a justification\\". Cline responded to this by arguing that there is no obvious reason to use a large discount rate just because this is what is usually done in economic analysis. In other words, climate change ought to be treated differently from other, more imminent problems. The Economist quoted Mendelsohn as worrying that \\"climate change was set up to fail\\". Moreover, Mendelsohn argued that Cline's damage estimates were excessive. Citing various recent articles, including some of his own, he stated that \\"[a] series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits.\\" Members of the panel, including Schelling, criticised the way this issue was handled in the Consensus project. The 2004 Copenhagen Consensus attracted various criticisms: Approach and alleged bias The 2004 report, especially its conclusion regarding climate change was subsequently criticised from a variety of perspectives. The general approach adopted to set priorities was criticised by Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist and advocate of both the Kyoto protocol Project Syndicate and increased development aid, who argued that the analytical framework was inappropriate and biased and that the project \\"failed to mobilize an expert group that could credibly identify and communicate a true consensus of expert knowledge on the range of issues under consideration.\\".Citation Results : Nature Tom Burke, a former director of Friends of the Earth, repudiated the entire approach of the project, arguing that applying cost‚Äìbenefit analysis in the way the Copenhagen panel did was \\"junk economics\\". John Quiggin, an Australian economics professor, commented that the project is a mix of \\"a substantial contribution to our understanding of important issues facing the world\\" and an \\"exercises in political propaganda\\" and argued that the selection of the panel members was slanted towards the conclusions previously supported by Lomborg.Copenhagen review at John Quiggin Quiggin observed that Lomborg had argued in his controversial book The Skeptical Environmentalist that resources allocated to mitigating global warming would be better spent on improving water quality and sanitation, and was therefore seen as having prejudged the issues. Under the heading \\"Wrong Question\\", Sachs further argued that: \\"The panel that drew up the Copenhagen Consensus was asked to allocate an additional US$50 billion in spending by wealthy countries, distributed over five years, to address the world‚Äôs biggest problems. This was a poor basis for decision-making and for informing the public. By choosing such a low sum ‚Äî a tiny fraction of global income ‚Äî the project inherently favoured specific low-cost schemes over bolder, larger projects. It is therefore no surprise that the huge and complex challenge of long-term climate change was ranked last, and that scaling up health services in poor countries was ranked lower than interventions against specific diseases, despite warnings in the background papers that such interventions require broader improvements in health services.\\" In response Lomborg argued that $50 billion was \\"an optimistic but realistic example of actual spending.\\" \\"Experience shows that pledges and actual spending are two different things. In 1970 the UN set itself the task of doubling development assistance. Since then the percentage has actually been dropping\\". \\"But even if Sachs or others could gather much more than $50 billion over the next 4 years, the Copenhagen Consensus priority list would still show us where it should be invested first.\\" Copenhagen Consensus 2004 ‚Äì addresses 10 major challenges in the world. ‚Äì Press releases One of the Copenhagen Consensus panel experts later distanced himself from the way in which the Consensus results have been interpreted in the wider debate. Thomas Schelling now thinks that it was misleading to put climate change at the bottom of the priority list. The Consensus panel members were presented with a dramatic proposal for handling climate change. If given the opportunity, Schelling would have put a more modest proposal higher on the list. The Yale economist Robert O. Mendelsohn was the official critic of the proposal for climate change during the Consensus. He thought the proposal was way out of the mainstream and could only be rejected. Mendelsohn worries that climate change was set up to fail. Michael Grubb, an economist and lead author for several IPCC reports, commented on the Copenhagen Consensus, writing: > To try and define climate policy as a trade-off against foreign aid is thus > a forced choice that bears no relationship to reality. No government is > proposing that the marginal costs associated with, for example, an emissions > trading system, should be deducted from its foreign aid budget. This way of > posing the question is both morally inappropriate and irrelevant to the > determination of real climate mitigation policy. Panel membership Quiggin argued that the members of the 2004 panel, selected by Lomborg, were \\"generally towards the right and, to the extent that they had stated views, to be opponents of Kyoto.\\" Sachs also noted that the panel members had not previously been much involved in issues of development economics and were unlikely to reach useful conclusions in the time available to them. Commenting on the 2004 Copenhagen Consensus, climatologist and IPCC author Stephen Schneider criticised Lomborg for only inviting economists to participate: > In order to achieve a true consensus, I think Lomborg would've had to invite > ecologists, social scientists concerned with justice and how climate change > impacts and policies are often inequitably distributed, philosophers who > could challenge the economic paradigm of \\"one dollar, one vote\\" implicit in > cost‚Äìbenefit analyses promoted by economists, and climate scientists who > could easily show that Lomborg's claim that climate change will have only > minimal effects is not sound science. Lomborg countered criticism of the panel membership by stating that \\"Sachs disparaged the Consensus 'dream team' because it only consisted of economists. But that was the very point of the project. Economists have expertise in economic prioritization. It is they and not climatologists or malaria experts who can prioritize between battling global warming or communicable disease\\".

Retrieved 29 April 2016 and began singing in working men's clubs and charity shows. Career Following an apprenticeship at the Arts Theatre in Nottingham, Pollard appeared on Opportunity Knocks in 1974 singing \\"I Cain't Say No\\" from Oklahoma! and came second to a singing Jack Russell. She went on to play in the musicals The Desert Song and Rose Marie with John Hanson, starred in the Cameron Mackintosh West End production of Godspell, played opposite Jack Wild in Big Sin City at the Roundhouse, toured in the musical Grease in a company that also included Tracey Ullman, with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Hugh Paddick in the farce Not Now Darling, won a role in Andrew Sachs play Philately Will Get You Nowhere and appeared at the Mermaid Theatre in a celebration of the music of Cole Porter called Oh Mr. Porter! Su's first comedy role was in a BBC series screened in 1978 entitled Two Up, Two Down in which she played a hippy named Flo. Paul Nicholas played her partner, Jimmy, both of whom were squatting in the house of a nice middle class couple. It only lasted one series, but then in 1979 came the pilot programme for a new BBC comedy written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft set in a holiday camp. Pollard landed the role of chalet maid Peggy Ollerenshaw in Hi- de-Hi!. She continued in this role until the programme's end in 1988, by which time she had become a household name. In 1981, she became one of the presenters of children's magazine show Get Set for Summer, in which she delivered wacky reports and bogus weather forecasts. During the run of Hi-de- Hi!, Pollard also had a singing career, and in 1986, she reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart with the song \\"Starting Together\\", the theme song from the BBC Television 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary series The Marriage. It was her only Top 40 hit; her first single, \\"Come To Me (I Am Woman)\\", had reached No. 71 in 1985 and her only charting album, Su, peaked at No. 86 in the UK Albums Chart in November 1986. In 1987, she toured the UK with The Su Pollard Show and co-hosted It's a Royal Knockout. Pollard also starred in the stage production of Hi De Hi! - The Holiday Musical, along with almost all of the cast from the television series, played sell out seasons in Bournemouth, London and Blackpool. In 1985 she played Sally in the West End production of Me And My Girl at the Adelphi Theatre which she appeared in for over a year.

He was born to a working-class Irish family in Quebec, but he moved to the Western frontier as a young man and quickly distinguished himself as a buffalo hunter, civilian scout, and Indian fighter on the Great Plains. He later earned fame as a gunfighter and sheriff in Dodge City, Kansas, during which time he was involved in several notable shootouts. By the mid-1880s, Masterson moved to Denver, Colorado, and established himself as a \\"sporting man\\" or gambler. He took an interest in prizefighting and became a leading authority on the sport, attending almost every important match and title fight in the United States from the 1880s until his death in 1921. He moved to New York City in 1902 and spent the rest of his life there as a reporter and columnist for the The Morning Telegraph. His column covered boxing and other sports, and it frequently gave his opinions on crime, war, politics, and other topics, as well. He became a close friend of President Theodore Roosevelt and was one of the \\"White House Gunfighters\\" who received federal appointments from Roosevelt, along with Pat Garrett and Ben Daniels. By the time of his death in 1921, Masterson was known throughout the country as a leading sports writer and celebrity. He is remembered today for his connection to many of the Wild West's most iconic people, places, and events, and his life and likeness are frequently depicted in American popular culture. Early life Masterson was born on November 26, 1853, at Henryville, Quebec, in the Eastern Townships of what was then known as Canada East. He was baptized under the name Bartholomew Masterson. Bartholomaeus Masterson in the 1870 US Census in St. Clair County, Illinois Masterson was the second child of Thomas Masterson (or Mastersan), who was born in Canada to an Irish family, and Catherine McGurk (or McGureth), who was born in Ireland. The other six Masterson children were Edward John (1852‚Äì1878), James Patrick (1855‚Äì1895), Nellie E. (1857‚Äì1925), Thomas (1858‚Äì1941), George Henry (1860‚Äì1889), and Emma Anna \\"Minnie\\" (1862‚Äì1884). The children were raised on farms in Quebec, New York, Illinois, and Missouri until the family finally settled near Wichita, Kansas.Clavin, Tom, \\"Dodge City\\", p.39 Move to the frontier In his late teens, Masterson and brothers, Ed and Jim, left their family's farm to hunt buffalo on the Great Plains. In July 1872, Ed and Bat Masterson were hired by a subcontractor named Raymond Ritter to grade a five-mile section of track for the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Ritter skipped out without paying the Masterson brothers all of the wages to which they were entitled. It took Masterson nearly a year, but he finally collected his overdue wages from Ritter, at gunpoint. On April 15, 1873, Masterson learned that Ritter was due to arrive in Dodge City, Kansas, aboard a Santa Fe train and that Ritter was carrying a large roll of cash. When Ritter's train pulled in, Masterson entered the car alone and confronted him and marched him out onto the rear platform of the train, where he forced him to hand over the $300 owed to him, his brother Ed, and a friend named Theodore Raymond. A loud cheer then went up from a large crowd which had witnessed the event.DeArment, Robert K. (1979) Bat Masterson: The Man and the Legend. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press. Battle of Adobe Walls Masterson was once again engaged in buffalo hunting on June 27, 1874, when he became an involuntary participant in one of the Wild West's most celebrated Indian fights: a five-day siege by several hundred Comanche, Kiowa and Cheyenne warriors led by Quanah Parker at a collection of ramshackle buildings in the Texas panhandle known as Adobe Walls. Masterson was one of just 28 hunters who defended the outpost during the attack. The Comanche suffered the most losses during the battle, though the actual number killed is not known, with reports ranging from a low of 30 to a high of 70. The defenders of Adobe Walls lost only four men, one of whom shot himself by accident. After being fought to a standstill, Quanah Parker and his followers rode off. In August 1874, Masterson signed on as a U.S. Army scout with Colonel Nelson Miles, who was leading a force from Fort Dodge to pursue Comanche and Apache war parties across the Cherokee Strip and into Texas. The force was eventually engaged to recover four sisters‚Äîranging in age from 9 to 15‚Äîwho had been captured by a group of Cheyenne Dog Soldiers. The sisters were part of a family that had been attacked outside of Ellis, Kansas, on September 11, 1874, while migrating to Colorado Territory. Their parents, brother, and two older sisters had been killed and scalped. All four sisters were recovered alive by Miles' force over a period of about six months. Gunfighter and lawman Deputies Bat Masterson (standing) and Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, 1876. The scroll on Earp's chest is a cloth pin-on badge. Masterson's first gunfight took place on January 24, 1876, in Sweetwater, Texas (later Mobeetie in Wheeler County). He was attacked by a soldier, Corporal Melvin A. King (real name Anthony Cook) allegedly because he was with a woman named Mollie Brennan. Brennan was hit by one of King's bullets, possibly by accident, and was killed. King died of his wounds. Masterson was shot in the pelvis but recovered.Bat Masterson and the Sweetwater Shootout; History Net online; accessed ??? Dodge City Masterson soon settled in Dodge City. On June 6, 1877, Masterson tried to prevent the arrest of Robert Gilmore, who was known to the locals as \\"Bobby Gill.\\" Masterson managed to wrap his arms about the girth of the 315 pound city marshal, Lawrence Edward \\"Larry\\" Deger, thereby permitting Gill to escape. Masterson was grabbed by friends of Deger and pistol-whipped by the lawman. The following day, Masterson was fined $25 for disturbing the peace. Bobby Gill, the cause of Masterson's fine, was assessed only $5. The Opening of the Cattle Trade Celebrated in the Dog House; Dodge City times., June 09, 1877 During July 1877, Masterson was hired to serve as under-sheriff to Sheriff Charles E. Bassett. Bassett was prohibited by the Kansas State Constitution from seeking a third consecutive term. With the job up for grabs, Masterson decided to run for the office. Masterson's opponent turned out to be Larry Deger. On November 6, 1877, Masterson was elected county sheriff of Ford County, Kansas, by the narrow margin of three votes. Within a month of Masterson's election, on December 6, 1877, Ed Masterson replaced Larry Deger as city marshal of Dodge, so together the Masterson brothers controlled the city and county police forces.Dodge City Times, December 8, 1877. Ed Masterson On February 1, 1878, Sheriff Masterson captured the notorious outlaws Dave Rudabaugh and Ed West, who were wanted for an attempted train robbery. Two more of the train robbers were caught by Bat and brother Ed on March 15. The tandem law enforcement effort came to an abrupt end, however, when 25-year-old City Marshal Ed Masterson was shot and killed in the line of duty on April 9, 1878. Ed Masterson was mortally wounded by a cowboy named Jack Wagner, who was unaware that Bat Masterson was in the vicinity. As Ed stumbled away from the scene, Bat Masterson responded from across the street, firing on both Wagner and Wagner's boss, Alf Walker‚Äîwho was holding a gun. Wagner died the next day, but Walker was taken back to Texas and recovered. The local newspapers were ambiguous about who shot Wagner and Walker, and this led some later historians to question whether Bat Masterson was involved. However, the rediscovery of two court cases in which Bat Masterson testified under oath that he had shot both men adds credence to the idea that Bat had avenged his brother.DeArment, Robert K. (2005) Broadway Bat: Gunfighter in Gotham (Talei Publishers)Penn, Chris. \\"Gunfire in Dodge City: The Night Ed Masterson Was Killed\\". Wild West. December 2004. More violence followed on October 4, 1878, when a variety actress named Dora Hand, known professionally as \\"Fannie Keenan,\\" was shot and killed by James Kenedy, son of the wealthy Texas cattleman, Miflin Kenedy. Masterson's posse, which included Wyatt Earp and Bill Tilghman, captured Kenedy the following day after Masterson shot him in the left arm, and other posse members killed his horse.Dodge City Times, October 12, 1878. Royal Gorge Railroad War Bat Masterson in 1879 Santa Fe Railroad officials had wired Sheriff Bat Masterson asking him to recruit men to battle the forces of the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad, which were contesting the right-of- way through the Royal Gorge near Pueblo, Colorado. As a sheriff in Kansas, Masterson had no authority in Colorado, but this did not prevent him from enlisting a large company of men. Among Masterson's recruits were such noted gunmen as Ben Thompson, \\"Mysterious Dave\\" Mather, John Joshua Webb, and possibly Doc Holliday. The end of Masterson's involvement came on June 12, 1879, when he surrendered a roundhouse his men were holding at Ca√±on City, Colorado. The \\"war\\" between the railroads was finally settled out of court. Masterson's Colorado activities did not go over well with the voters of Ford County, Kansas. On November 4, 1879, a bartender named George T. Hinkel defeated Masterson in his re-election bid for sheriff by a vote of 404 to 268.Dodge City Times, November 8, 1879. no link found Billy Thompson and Buffalo Bill Cody The 1880 Dodge City census shows that, at that time, Masterson was living with Annie Ladue, age 19 (described as his \\"concubine\\"). City Marshal James Masterson, Bat's younger brother, was listed on the same census as living with Minnie Roberts, age 16. Not long after this census was taken, Bat Masterson received a telegram from Ben Thompson asking Bat to save Ben's troublesome brother, Billy Thompson, from almost certain lynching in Ogallala, Nebraska. Billy Thompson had shot the thumb off a man named Tucker, who, despite missing a digit, managed to fire back and seriously wound Billy. Masterson took Billy Thompson out of Ogallala by a midnight train bound for North Platte, Nebraska. In North Platte, Masterson was provided with assistance by William F. \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, who promptly offered to help. According to Masterson, he and Billy Thompson \\"were given a royal welcome and were immediately taken in charge by Colonel Cody, who found a safe place for us to remain until he could outfit us for the trip across the country to Dodge City.\\"Masterson, W.B. \\"Bat.\\" \\"Colonel Cody - Hunter, Scout, Indian Fighter.\\" Human Life. Vol. 6, No.6. March 1908. This episode was reported in the Dodge City Times, which noted that \\"W.B. Masterson arrived from a visit to Ogallala, this week. He says Nebraska is dry and many people are leaving the state. He came by wagon, and was accompanied by 'Texas Billy' Thompson. The latter has recovered from his wounds.\\"Dodge City Times, July 17, 1880. Battle of the plaza Photograph of the interior of the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas, taken between 1870 and 1885 Masterson spent the remainder of 1880 in Kansas City and Dodge. On February 8, 1881, he left Dodge City and joined Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, where he met Luke Short for the first time. Earp, Short, and Masterson worked as faro dealers, or \\"look outs\\", at Tombstone's Oriental Saloon. Masterson had only been in Tombstone for two months when he received an urgent telegram that compelled him to return to Dodge City. His brother Jim had a partnership with Alfred James \\"A.J.\\" Peacock in Dodge City's Lady Gay Saloon and Dance Hall. Albert \\"Al\\" Updegraff was Peacock's brother-in-law and bartender. Updegraff was a drunk, and Jim thought him dishonest. Jim had demanded that Peacock fire Updegraff, but Peacock refused. Their disagreement grew until threats were made, prompting the telegram. Masterson arrived in Dodge City on April 16, 1881, where he accosted Updegraff and Peacock. Recognizing Masterson, Updegraff and Peacock retreated behind the jail and exchanged gunfire with him. Who had fired first is not clear. Citizens ran for cover as bullets ripped through the Long Branch Saloon. Other individuals began firing in support of both sides until Updegraff was wounded. Mayor A.B. Webster arrested Masterson. Afterward, Masterson learned that his brother Jim was not in danger. Updegraff recovered from his wounds, but the shooter who hit him could not be identified, so Masterson was fined $8.00 and released. Citizens were outraged and warrants were issued, but Bat and Jim Masterson were permitted to leave Dodge City. Bat Masterson became more widely known as a gunfighter as a result of a practical joke played on a gullible newspaper reporter in August 1881. Seeking copy in Gunnison, Colorado, the reporter asked Dr. W.S. Cockrell about man-killers. Dr. Cockrell pointed to a young man nearby and said it was Masterson and that he had killed 26 men. Cockrell then regaled the reporter with several lurid tales about Masterson's supposed exploits, and the reporter wrote them up for the New York Sun. The story was widely reprinted in papers all over the country. Cockrell subsequently apologized to Masterson, who insisted he was not even in Gunnison at the time. City marshal of Trinidad, Colorado Masterson was appointed city marshal of Trinidad, Colorado, on April 17, 1882. He had hardly settled into his $75-a-month marshal's job when Wyatt Earp requested his help to prevent the extradition of Doc Holliday from Colorado to Arizona. Masterson took his case directly to Colorado Governor Frederick W. Pitkin, who listened to Masterson's appeal and finally refused to grant Holliday's extradition. However, Masterson's rescue of Doc Holliday, as well as his nightly \\"moonlighting\\" as a faro dealer, spelled doom for his career as city marshal of Trinidad. On March 28, 1883, a local paper noted: \\"There are now two 'bankers' running for city offices ‚Äì Mr. Taylor of the Las Animas County Bank, and Mr. Masterson of the bank of 'Fair O.' Both have a large number of depositors ‚Äì one of time depositors and the other receives his deposits for keeps.\\"Trinidad Daily Advertiser, March 28, 1883. On April 3, 1883, Masterson was defeated by a lopsided vote of 637 to 248. Dodge City War The \\"Dodge City Peace Commission\\" on June 10, 1883. From left to right, standing: William H. Harris, Luke Short, Bat Masterson, William F. Petillon; seated: Charlie Bassett, Wyatt Earp, Michael Francis \\"Frank\\" McLean and Cornelius \\"Neil\\" Brown. Masterson's term as city marshal of Trinidad ended just in time for him to come to the aid of his friend, Luke Short, who had been run out of Dodge City by the mayor and Masterson's long-time enemy, Larry Deger. Within weeks, a group of gunfighters recruited by Masterson and Earp descended upon Dodge City to resolve what became known as the \\"Dodge City War.\\" The result of this gathering reinstated Luke Short in Dodge. Before disbanding on June 10, 1883, Short, Masterson, Earp, and five other notable men from frontier history posed for a group portrait that was soon labeled \\"The Dodge City Peace Commission.\\" The photo became an iconic image of the Old West. First attempt at journalism Masterson was back in Dodge City on November 1, 1884, where he issued a small newspaper called Vox Populi which was devoted to local political issues. Three days after its appearance, he received a flattering ‚Äì and prophetic ‚Äì review of his journalistic effort from another Dodge City paper which observed: \\"We are in receipt of the first number of Vox Populi, W.B. Masterson, editor, which in appearance is very neat and tidy. The news and statements it contains seem to be of a somewhat personal nature. The editor is very promising; if he survives the first week of his literary venture, there is no telling what he may accomplish in the journalistic field.\\"Globe Live Stock Journal, November 4, 1884. Editor Masterson did not survive his first week. Vox Populi folded after printing just one issue and almost another 20 years would pass before he made journalism a full-time profession in New York City. Denver Masterson finally left Dodge City and made Denver, Colorado, his center of interest, where he soon became involved in a divorce scandal. The trouble began in a Denver theater on September 18, 1886, when a comedian named Lou Spencer, who was performing on stage, spotted his wife, Nellie, seated in the audience on Masterson's knee. Spencer cut short his routine and confronted Masterson, who hit Spencer across the face with his pistol. Nellie Spencer watched from the wings while the two men slugged it out. Finally, they were arrested, fined, and released a short time later. In its account of the incident, the Rocky Mountain News described Masterson as one \\"who pleases the ladies\\", and Nellie McMahon Spencer as \\"a beautiful woman, with a fine wardrobe and a sweet voice.\\"Rocky Mountain News, September 22, 1886. Three days later, Nellie filed for divorce and the Denver papers were quick to report that Nellie had \\"eloped\\" with Masterson. No record has been found of the two ever getting married, and she soon disappeared from Masterson's life.DeArment, Robert K. (2013) Gunfighter in Gotham: Bat Masterson's New York City Years.

There, Masterson probably first met an Indian club swinger and singer, Emma Moulton. The pair subsequently lived together and they were widely reported to have married in Denver on November 21, 1891, although no record of the marriage has been found. The only known source for that date was given by Masterson's brother, Thomas Masterson, years after Bat had died. Emma was not divorced from her first husband, Edwin Winford Moulton, until November 9, 1893.Penn, Chris. (2011). \\"Bat Masterson's Emma.\\" Wild West Historical Association Journal, Volume IV Number 2. When they were later enumerated in the 1910 U.S. Census, Bat and Emma claimed that they had been married for 17 years, suggesting a marriage date of 1893. Masterson's biographer has raised the possibility that they were married on November 21, 1893, two weeks after Emma's divorce from Edwin Moulton. The two were traveling through the eastern states at that time, but an actual marriage record has not been found. It was in Denver that Masterson met and began a long-term friendship with the infamous confidence man and crime boss Soapy Smith.Smith, Jeff (2009). Alias Soapy Smith: The Life and Death of a Scoundrel, Klondike Research. p. 84. In 1889, the two were involved in election scandal involving fraudulent registration ballot casting.Rocky Mountain News 03/20/1890 & 03/15/1890, p. 6. Prizefighting Masterson maintained an interest in prizefighting and other sports, and was known as a frequent attendee at boxing matches across the country. He frequently placed bets on the fights and occasionally served in an official capacity as a second or a timekeeper. He knew‚Äîand was known by‚Äîthe heavyweight champions of the era, from John L. Sullivan and James J. \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Corbett to Jack Johnson and Jack Dempsey. The sports-minded Masterson was ringside during the John L. Sullivan ‚Äì Jake Kilrain heavyweight championship fight at Richburg, Mississippi, on July 8, 1889. He was the designated timekeeper for Kilrain and came under fire from some sources for how he handled his role. Reportedly, Masterson saw to it that Luke Short, Johnny Murphy, and \\"twelve other good men were scattered around the ring where they would do the most good in case of an emergency.\\"Cleveland Plain Dealer, July 13, 1889. In early 1892 Masterson moved to the silver boom-town of Creede, Colorado where he managed the Denver Exchange gambling club until the town was destroyed by fire on June 5, 1892. On September 7, 1892, Masterson, Short, and Charlie Bassett attended the Sullivan‚ÄìCorbett championship fight in New Orleans. According to a Dodge City paper, Masterson bet on the winner, while noting, \\"Charlie Bassett and Luke Short were among the notables in attendance. Bassett bet his money on Sullivan.\\"Dodge City Globe-Republican, September 9, 1892. Masterson was in Jacksonville, Florida, on January 25, 1894, acting as a second for Charlie Mitchell during Mitchell's heavyweight title shot at the champion, James J. \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Corbett. Mitchell was knocked cold in three rounds. Last years in Denver Masterson moved to New York City in 1895 to briefly serve as a bodyguard for millionaire George Gould. He wrote to his Denver friends glowing accounts of fishing trips \\"with the Goulds on their yacht,\\" and announced his intention to remain in New York City indefinitely. On June 6, 1895, a Denver paper quoted a friend of Masterson's, who observed that \\"Bat has at last fallen into a dead easy game.\\"Rocky Mountain News, June 6, 1895. Masterson returned to Denver for several more years.1900 United States Federal Census Record, Arapahoe, Denver, Precinct #3; text summary: William Masterson, birthplace of Missouri and birth-date of 1854; holding an occupation as Athletic Club Keeper. His wife is listed as Emma Masterson, married for 10 years. On April 6, 1897, serving as a deputy sheriff of Arapahoe County, he got into a dispute on election day with a Tim Connors. Masterson drew his pistol and Connors attempted to seize it. During the scuffle, the gun discharged and C.C. Louderbaugh was shot in the left wrist. On April 9, 1899, Masterson became a partner in a boxing club called the Colorado Athletic Association. Within a few days, Masterson was excluded from the organization by his partners. Masterson retaliated on April 18 by founding a rival club, the Olympic, with himself as president. Masterson received favorable media coverage from a Denver newspaper called George's Weekly, where he was employed as sports editor. In September 1900, Masterson sold his interest in the Olympic Athletic Club and made another visit to New York City. Masterson had decided to settle in New York City, but had a sudden change of heart and returned to Denver, with humiliating results. Two conflicting versions are given for what caused his final departure from Denver. Masterson's story was that an irate woman belted him with an umbrella on May 2, 1902, when she took exception to an \\"undesirable\\" such as Masterson trying to cast his ballot at a local election. An alternate version states that Masterson had become a dangerous drunk who was run out of Denver for being a public nuisance.Raine, William McLeod. Guns of the Frontier. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. 1940. pp. 167‚Äì169. Whatever actually happened, Masterson left Denver and never returned. New York City Journalism career By June 6, 1902, Masterson was in New York City, where he and two other men were arrested on a bunco charge. Masterson and his companions were accused of fleecing George H. Snow, a Mormon elder, out of $17,000. Two days after his arrest, Masterson complained to a reporter, \\"This fellow Gargan who arrested me is a warm baby ‚Äì in his mind. He thinks all people are suckers. That's the trouble with these mush-headed coppers. Give them a political job to keep from starving and they think they own the earth.\\"New York World, June 8, 1902. No sooner had these charges been dropped than on June 15, 1902, Masterson was arrested again for carrying a concealed weapon. A friend, journalist, Alfred Henry Lewis, persuaded his brother, William Lewis, to provide Masterson with employment as a columnist for William's newspaper, the New York Morning Telegraph. His column, \\"Masterson's Views on Timely Topics,\\" concerned sports in general and boxing in particular. The column appeared thrice weekly from 1903 until his death in 1921. In 1905, Alfred Henry Lewis published The Sunset Trail, a fictionalized biography of Masterson.Lewis, Alfred Henry. The Sunset Trail: A Novel. New York: A. L. Burt Company. 1905. Bat Masterson circa 1911 in New York City Lewis encouraged Masterson to write a series of sketches about his adventures, which were published by Lewis in Human Life magazine. In 1907, Masterson provided five biographical studies of Ben Thompson,Human Life (Vol. 4, No. 4) January, 1907. Wyatt Earp,Human Life (Vol. 4, No. 5) February, 1907. Luke Short,Human Life (Vol. 5, No. 1) April, 1907. Doc HollidayHuman Life (Vol. 5, No. 2) May, 1907. and Bill Tilghman.Human Life (Vol. 5, No. 4) July, 1907. Masterson explained to his audience what he felt were the best properties of a gunfighter. Other articles were supposed to be in Masterson's Human Life series, which had appeared under the title of \\"Famous Gun Fighters of the Western Frontier\\", but the next three issues of Human Life came and went without a Masterson article. In the November 1907 issue, editor Alfred Henry Lewis assured the readers that Masterson would resume the series by explaining that Masterson's reasons for \\"breaking off the output\\" were \\"wholly of an idle, indolent, midsummer sort, which the managers of this magazine hope to overthrow so soon as a cooler temperature comes to the assistance of their arguments.\\" Lewis offered this apology as part of his own article called \\"The King of the Gun-Players: William Barclay Masterson.\\"Human Life (Vol. 6, No. 2) November, 1907. Lewis met with only limited success. Masterson provided only one more article, on Buffalo Bill Cody,Human Life (Vol. 6, No. 6) March, 1908. which was his final Human Life contribution. Concurrent to his career as a newspaper writer, Masterson served as the timekeeper for many prize fights, most notably for the Jack Johnson ‚Äì Jess Willard title fight in Havana, Cuba, on April 5, 1915. A newsreel featuring the then 61-year-old Masterson's introduction in that role was included in a documentary called Legendary Champions 1882‚Äì1929. Presidential appointment Alfred Henry Lewis introduced Masterson to President Theodore Roosevelt, and the two formed a friendship that resulted in Masterson being a frequent White House guest and also included regular correspondence. President Roosevelt arranged for Masterson's appointment as deputy U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of New York. On February 2, 1905, Roosevelt wrote Masterson a letter which concluded with the lines: \\"You must be careful not to gamble or do anything while you are a public officer which might afford opportunity to your enemies and my critics to say that your appointment was improper. I wish you to show this letter to Alfred Henry Lewis and go over the matter with him.\\"Roosevelt to Masterson, February 2, 1905. Theodore Roosevelt Collection, Widener Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Masterson served in the position, earning $2,000 per year (equal to $ today), until 1909. Theodore Roosevelt did not seek a third term in 1908, and his successor, William Howard Taft, did not share Roosevelt's enthusiasm for Masterson. President Taft had his attorney general conduct an investigation of Masterson's employment as a deputy U.S. Marshal, which resulted in Masterson being terminated on August 1, 1909. For the remaining 12 years of his life, Masterson covered the major boxing events of that era for the New York Morning Telegraph. On April 5, 1915, the 61-year-old Masterson was in Havana, Cuba, attending the heavyweight championship fight between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. As he arrived, he posed for a newsreel cameraman. In the brief film clip, he doffs his hat, smiles for the camera, and dons his hat.DeMattos, Jack. Masterson and Roosevelt. College Station, TX: Creative Publishing Company. 1984. . Later that day, in the official film of the fight, Masterson can be seen as one of the seconds for Jess Willard, climbing through the ropes just prior to the fight.Boxing's Best: Jack Johnson, HBO Sports Presentation. Big Fights, Inc., 1989. VHS Tape, 55 minutes. Final days On July 2, 1921, Masterson attended his last heavyweight championship fight, the so-called \\"Million Dollar Gate\\", promoted by George \\"Tex\\" Rickard, in which Jack Dempsey defended (and retained) his title of heavyweight champion of the world. Three months later, on October 7, silent-screen cowboy star William S. Hart visited Masterson. They were photographed standing together on the roof of the New York Morning Telegraph building and went back to Masterson's office where he asked Hart to sit in his chair and pose for a second photo with him. According to Hart: \\"I did so, and he stood beside me. Mr. Masterson was sitting in that same chair eighteen days later when he heard the last call.\\"Hart, William S. My Life East and West. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. 1929. p. 307. Hart subsequently cast a lookalike as Masterson in his biographical film Wild Bill Hickok, which was released in 1923. Death and burial The grave of Bat Masterson On October 25, 1921, at age 67, Masterson died at his desk from a massive heart attack after writing what became his final column for the Morning Telegraph. About 500 people attended Masterson's service at Frank E. Campbell's Funeral Church at Broadway and 66th Street. Masterson's honorary pallbearers included Damon Runyon, Tex Rickard, and William Lewis. Runyon was a close friend of Masterson's and offered this memorable eulogy: \\"He was a 100 percent, 22-karat real man. Bat was a good hater and a wonderful friend. He was always stretching out his hand to some down-and-outer. He had a great sense of humor and a marvelous fund of reminiscence, and was one of the most entertaining companions we have ever known. There are only too few men in the world like Bat Masterson and his death is a genuine loss.\\" Masterson was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. His full name, William Barclay Masterson, appears above his epitaph on the large granite grave marker. Masterson's epitaph states that he was \\"Loved by Everyone\\". In popular culture Masterson's life has been portrayed in countless works of fiction and non-fiction in film, television, literature, and other popular media.

Nixon's work as producer and writer introduced a number of new storylines to American daytime television ‚Äì the first health-related storyline, the first storyline related to the Vietnam War, the first on-screen lesbian kiss and the first on-screen abortion. She won five Writers' Guild of America Awards, five Daytime Emmy Awards, and in 2010 received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Nixon was often referred to as the \\"Queen\\" of the modern American soap opera. Career Early years Nixon was born Agnes Eckhardt on December 10, 1922,Agnes Nixon Obituary in Chicago, Illinois,Archive of American Television/ the daughter of Agnes Patricia (n√©e Dalton) and Harry Joseph Eckhardt.Profile, filmreference.com; accessed August 27, 2015. She attended Northwestern University, where she was a member of Alpha Chi Omega sorority. She began her career in soaps working for Irna Phillips. Under her tutelage, Nixon was a writer on Woman in White and As the World Turns, and was head writer for Search for Tomorrow, Guiding Light, and Another World. During her time on Guiding Light, Nixon is believed to have written the first health-related storyline on a daytime soap opera. A friend of Nixon's had died from cervical cancer, and Nixon wanted to do something to educate women about getting a pap smear. She wrote it into Guiding Light by having the lead character, Bert Bauer, experience a cancer scare. The storyline aired in 1962. In 2002, she was the inaugural recipient of the Pioneer for Health Award from Sentinel for Health for her work on the episode. One Life to Live By the mid-1960s, Nixon had created a blueprint for what would become All My Children. ABC executives passed on the program, due to contractual issues with sponsor Lever Brothers, who sponsored a program that All My Children would replace in its time slot. Consequently, they asked her to create a show that would reflect a more \\"contemporary\\" tone; that creation was One Life to Live. Nixon, \\"tired of the restraints imposed by the WASPy, non-controversial nature of daytime drama\\", presented the network with a startlingly original premise and cast of characters. Although the show was built along the classic soap formula of a rich family (the Lords) and a poor family (the Woleks), One Life to Live emphasized the ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the people of Llanview, Pennsylvania, a fictional Main Line suburb of Philadelphia.\\" Premiering in 1968, One Life to Live reflected changing social structures and attitudes. The first few years of the show were rich in issue stories and characters including a Jewish character (Dave Siegel), an Irish American family (the Rileys), and some of the first African American leading roles in soap operas with Sadie Gray (Lillian Hayman), Carla Gray (Ellen Holly) and Ed Hall (Al Freeman Jr.). Carla's story, for example, had her develop from a character who was passing as white to one who embodied black pride, with white and black lovers along the way, to antagonize racists. One Life to Live has been called \\"the most peculiarly American of soap operas: the first serial to present a vast array of ethnic types, broad comic situations, a constant emphasis on social issues, and strong male characters.\\"The Soap Opera Encyclopedia, pg. 158. All My Children With the success of One Life to Live, Nixon was given the greenlight for All My Children, which began as a half-hour soap opera in 1970. The show was successful from its beginning, combining its study of social clashes with acting talent including Ruth Warrick (Phoebe Tyler) and Rosemary Prinz (Amy Tyler). Nixon helmed the writing team for over a decade, until 1983, and again introduced many social issues into storylines, including the Vietnam War, the anti-war movement, homosexuality, the AIDS epidemic, and American television's first onscreen abortion.Gary Warner, All My Children: The Complete Family Scrapbook; .Simon, p. 148. All My Children was a half-hour show for the first seven years of its run, and virtually no recordings of those episodes survive; ABC erased the tapes of those early episodes so the reels could be reused. When ABC went to Nixon and said that they wanted her to expand the show to an hour in 1975, she resisted due to her own creative/quality concerns but later agreed under the condition that the tapes of the show would be archived and preserved by the network. Episodes began to be saved in 1976, and All My Children expanded to an hour on April 25, 1977.Nixon profile , museum.tv; accessed August 27, 2015. In 1992, ABC executives decided that All My Children needed new blood and promoted a Nixon prot√©g√©, Megan McTavish, to the position of head writer. Nixon continued to be involved with the show, but wanted to take a step back from the grueling day-to-day task of being a head writer. McTavish made some important changes by re-writing major storylines and was dismissed in early 1995. Lorraine Broderick returned as head writer, working alongside Nixon to return the show to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Broderick and Nixon went on to accept three consecutive Daytime Emmy awards for Outstanding Writing Team. Still, in late 1997, ABC abruptly decided to bring back McTavish. This move led to Nixon's electing to step back from her story consulting role. In early 1999, McTavish was dismissed for the second time and Nixon was again asked to take over the headwriting reins at All My Children. Nixon again wove social issues into the show, by having a major character \\"come out\\". In 2000, Erica's daughter, Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel), returned to Pine Valley and came out as a lesbian to her mother and to all of Pine Valley. This storyline led to All My Childrens winning a casting Artios award, a GLAAD Media Award, and a nomination for a Daytime Emmy for Best Drama Series.  Loving/The City  In 1983, Nixon began another series called Loving, which she co-created with Douglas Marland. The half-hour program debuted on ABC in June of that year and was set in the fictional town of Corinth, Pennsylvania. Loving struggled to gain a foothold in a crowded daytime schedule and ended its run in 1995. Nixon was given co-creator credit for Loving's continuation series, The City. The show was cancelled in 1997 due to low ratings. On-screen appearances Nixon appeared in her shows on a number of occasions. In both All My Children and One Life to Live she played the character Agnes Eckhardt. She also played the characters Aggie on All My Children and Agnes Dixon on One Life to Live. Personal life and death She was married to Robert Henry Adolphus Nixon from April 6, 1951, until his death in 1996, and had four children. Nixon died in Haverford, Pennsylvania, on September 28, 2016, at age 93. The New York Times reported the cause of death to be \\"pneumonia resulting from Parkinson's disease\\". Nixon's memoirs, published in 2017, was titled \\"My Life to Live: How I Became the Queen of Soaps When Men ruled the Airwaves\\" ().Philadelphia Inquirer Awards and recognition * In 1973 she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Program Achievement in Daytime Drama for One Life to LivePrimetime Emmy nomination, emmys.com; accessed August 27, 2015. * In 1977 Nixon won Outstanding Achievement in the World of Daytime Drama at the Soapy Awards. * She received the Trustees Award for Continued Excellence from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in 1981. * In 1985, Nixon won a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series for All My Children. * In 1988, 1996, 1997 and 1998, Nixon's All My Children writing team won Outstanding Drama Series Writing Team at the Daytime Emmys.

Erhai was also known as Yeyuze () or Kunming Lake () in ancient times. Etymology The character \\"Ê¥±\\" (er) was evolved from \\"Êòé\\" (ming) and irrelevant with ear (ËÄ≥) that is a common error. During the Han to Tang dynasty, there was an ancient ethnic named Kunming Yi or Kunming Barbarian () lived in the neighbouring region of Erhai lake. Therefore, the lake was also called \\"Kunming Lake\\". The Kunming Yi has another name Kun-mi (). In the following time, Chinese literature recorded the name \\"ÊòÜÂº•\\" as \\"ÊòÜÂº≠\\" (Kun-mi) that \\"Âº≠\\" is a rebus of \\"Âº•\\". And the name of the lake was also be changed to the character \\"Ê∏≥\\" (mi) which has a water-meaning-component attached to it. After that, some literature simplified the character \\"Ê∏≥\\" to \\"Ê¥±\\" (er), even though they are different in pronunciation. Thus, the name \\"Erhai\\" continues to this day. Geography cormorant fisherwoman returning to shore on Erhai Lake Erhai is situated at above sea level. In size, the North-South length of the lake is and the East- West width is roughly . Its area is , making it the second largest highland lake of China, after Dianchi Lake. Its circumference reaches , its average depth is of and the total storage capacity of . The lake serves as a backdrop to all of Dali City and sandwiches Dali Town in the west against the Cang Mountain. The lake's head is at Shangguan Town, its northern extremity, and its southernmost point is at Xiaguan Town. The lake receives water from the Miju and Mici Rivers in the north, the Bolou River in the east, and smallers streams from the Cang Mountains in the west. Yangbi River, to the south, is the lake's outlet and eventually flows into the Lancang River (Mekong River). Attractions The lakeshore can be explored by hiking. Highlights include Erhai Park and the Butterfly Springs on the Western bank. Islands on the lake - including Guanyin Ge, Jinsuo Island (), Nanzhao Folklore Island () and Xiaoputuo Island () - are also available for visits. The lake is an important food source for the local people (Bais), who are famous for their fishing method: their trained cormorants catch fish and return them to fishmongers. The birds are prevented from swallowing their fish by rings fixed around their neck. Biodiversity There is, or was, a rich biodiversity in Erhai. It is one of three major Yunnan lakes with a high number of endemics, the two other being Fuxian and Dian (Dianchi).Wang, Wang, Li, Du, Yang, Lassoie, and Hassan (2013).

Conserv. 22: 3197‚Äì3221. doi: 10.1007/s10531-013-0579-0 Of the 23 fish species and subspecies known from Erhai, 8 are endemic: Cyprinus barbatus, C. daliensis, C. longipectoralis, C. megalophthalmus, Paracobitis erhaiensis, Poropuntius daliensis (syn. Barbodes daliensis), P. exiguus (syn. B. exigua) and Zacco taliensis (syn. Schizothorax taliensis). Among these, only C. barbatus and C. longipectoralis have been recorded since the year 2000; the remaining have not been recorded in decades and are likely extinct. A few of the non-endemic natives have also been extirpated from the lake. In contrast, the lake is now home to more than 10 introduced fish species. A few native hydrophytes have also disappeared from the lake. The lake used to be a royal deer ranch for the Nanzhao Kingdom.

Equant (or punctum aequans) is a mathematical concept developed by Claudius Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD to account for the observed motion of the planets. The equant is used to explain the observed speed change in planetary orbit during different stages of the orbit. This planetary concept allowed Ptolemy to keep the theory of uniform circular motion alive by stating that the path of heavenly bodies was uniform around one point and circular around another point.  Placement  The equant point (shown in the diagram by the large ‚Ä¢ ), is placed so that it is directly opposite to Earth from the deferent's center, known as the eccentric (represented by the √ó ). A planet or the center of an epicycle (a smaller circle carrying the planet) was conceived to move at a constant angular speed with respect to the equant. In other words, to a hypothetical observer placed at the equant point, the epicycle's center (indicated by the small ¬∑ ) would appear to move at a steady angular speed. However, the epicycle's center will not move at a constant speed along its deferent. The reason for the implementation of the equant was to maintain a semblance of constant circular motion of celestial bodies, a long-standing article of faith originated by Aristotle for philosophical reasons, while also allowing for the best match of the computations of the observed movements of the bodies, particularly in the size of the apparent retrograde motion of all Solar System bodies except the Sun and the Moon.  Equation  The angle Œ± whose vertex is at the center of the deferent and whose sides intersect the planet and the equant respectively is a function of time t: : \\\\alpha(t) = \\\\Omega t - \\\\arcsin\\\\left(\\\\frac{E}{R} \\\\sin(\\\\Omega t) \\\\right) where Œ© is the constant angular speed seen from the equant which is situated at a distance E when the radius of the deferent is R. Eccentrics, deferents, epicycles and equants (Mathpages) The equant model has a body in motion on a circular path that does not share a center with Earth. The moving object's speed will actually vary during its orbit around the outer circle (dashed line), faster in the bottom half and slower in the top half. The motion is considered uniform only because the planet sweeps around equal angles in equal times from the equant point. The speed of the object is non- uniform when viewed from any other point within the orbit. Discovery and use Ptolemy introduced the equant in \\"Almagest\\". The evidence that the equant was a required adjustment to Aristotelian physics relied on observations made by himself and a certain \\"Theon\\" (perhaps, Theon of Smyrna). In models of the universe that precede Ptolemy, generally attributed to Hipparchus, the eccentric and epicycles were already a feature. The Roman Pliny in the 1st century CE, who apparently had access to writings of late Greek astronomers, and not being an astronomer himself, still correctly identified the lines of apsides for the five known planets and where they pointed in the zodiac. Such data requires the concept of eccentric centers of motion. Most of what we know about Hipparchus comes to us through mentions of his works by Ptolemy in the Almagest. Hipparchus' models' features explained differences in the length of the seasons on Earth (known as the \\"first anomaly\\"), and the appearance of retrograde motion in the planets (known as the \\"second anomaly\\"). But Hipparchus was unable to make the predictions about the location and duration of retrograde motions of the planets match observations; he could match location, or he could match duration, but not both simultaneously. An excellent video on the effects of the equant Ptolemy's introduction of the equant resolved that contradiction: the location was determined by the deferent and epicycle, while the duration was determined by uniform motion around the equant. Ptolemy's model of astronomy was used as a technical method that could answer questions regarding astrology and predicting planets positions for almost 1500 years, even though the equant and eccentric were violations of pure Aristotelian physics which required all motion to be centered on the Earth. For many centuries rectifying these violations was a preoccupation among scholars, culminating in the solutions of Ibn al-Shatir and Copernicus. Ptolemy's predictions, which required constant oversight and corrections by concerned scholars over those centuries, culminated in the observations of Tycho Brahe at Uraniborg. It wasn't until Johannes Kepler published his Astronomia Nova, based on the data he and Tycho collected at Uraniborg, that Ptolemy's model of the heavens was entirely supplanted by a new geometrical model.  Criticism  The equant solved the last major problem of accounting for the anomalistic motion of the planets but was believed by some to compromise the principles of the ancient Greek philosopher/astronomers, namely uniform circular motion about the Earth. The uniformity was generally assumed to be observed from the center of the deferent, and since that happens at only one point, only non-uniform motion is observed from any other point. Ptolemy moved the observation point explicitly off the center of the deferent to the equant. This can be seen as breaking part of the uniform circular motion rules. Noted critics of the equant include the Persian astronomer Nasir al-Din Tusi who developed the Tusi-couple as an alternative explanation, and Nicolaus Copernicus, whose alternative was a new pair of epicycles for each deferent. Dislike of the equant was a major motivation for Copernicus to construct his heliocentric system. (copyright renewed 1985)Koestler A. (1959), The Sleepwalkers, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, p. 322; see also p. 206 and refs therein. This violation of perfect circular motion around the center of the deferent bothered many thinkers, especially Copernicus who mentions the equant as a monstrous construction in De Revolutionibus. Copernicus' movement of the Earth away from the center of the universe obviated the primary need for Ptolemy's epicycles by explaining retrograde movement as an optical illusion, but he re-instituted two smaller epicycles into each planet's motion in order to replace the equant.

It is named after builder William Baker, who laid out the street in the 18th century. The street is most famous for its connection to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, who lived at a fictional 221B Baker Street address on the north of the street. The area was originally high class residential, but now is mainly occupied by commercial premises. Location Baker Street is a busy thoroughfare, lying in postcode areas NW1/W1 and forming part of the A41. It used to run south from Regent's Park, the junction with Park Road, parallel to Gloucester Place, meeting Marylebone Road, Portman Square and Wigmore Street. In 2019, the until-then one-way street was changed to accommodate lanes running in both directions. At the junction with Wigmore Street, Baker Street turns into Orchard Street, which ends when it meets with Oxford Street. After Portman Square the road continues as Orchard Street. The crossroads of Baker Street and Marylebone Road was historically known as Marylebone Circus, which is still its unofficial name. History Baker Street (centre vertically) on an 1875 Ordnance Survey map.1875 Ordnance Survey map, Digimap, 3 April 2018. Baker Street was laid out in the 18th century by the builder William Baker, after whom it is named. 19th century In 1835, the first wax museum of Madame Tussauds was opened on Baker Street. The museum moved, just around the corner, to Marylebone Road in 1884. Also in 1835 the sculptor James Fillans came to live and work from 82 Baker Street. Residents of the prestigious mansion block, Chiltern Court, on the Regent's Park end of Baker Street include the novelists Arnold Bennett and H. G. Wells who are commemorated with a blue plaque.

Col. Lloyd Chapman and Kathleen Chapman, was a Canadian space researcher. Chapman started his career with his work on radio propagation and the ionosphere. He received his BSc (Honors) from The University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario in 1948, and later received a Master of Science degree and a Ph.D. in physics at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. After his studies at university Chapman got his first position in the government with the Defence Research Board (DRB). He was then promoted to the position of section leader of the ionospheric propagation unit at the Defense Research Telecommunications Establishment , which is now the Communications Research Centre (CRC) in 1951 at Shirley's Bay, a Canadian military and civilian telecommunication research campus. He was also a superintendent. While at Shirley's Bay he worked on a number of projects. One of the projects he directed was the ground-breaking Canadian satellite called Alouette. The DRTE having no experience developing satellites had to work quite hard to think of and counter all the difficulties they would face in the harsh environment of space. Because of his work on Alouette he was promoted to chairman of government study group to study the upper atmosphere and space programs in Canada. While chairman, he compiled his findings into \\"The Chapman Report\\" in which he argued that Canada needed to redirect its space program in order to continue its ongoing research more effectively and efficiently. \\"The Chapman Report\\" remains an important document in helping the Canadian Space Agency choose what they should work on when it comes to space programs. Chapman was given awards for his work in aero-space technology. The first was given by the Royal Society of Canada in 1966; he also received an Engineering medal from the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario and the Dillinger Gold Medal from the International Union of Radio Scientists the same year. In 1967 Chapman was awarded with The Chree Medal and Prize and the McCurdy award from the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institution. Chapman was a member of the Royal Society of Canada. He was also part of the National Research Council (NRC) Associate committee on Space Research, a council of the top Canadian space scientists. He also served on the International Union of Radio Science and the American Geophysical Union. After his death in 1979, the Canadian Space Agency was formed to organize and give Canada its own space agency to create a central place to meet and work on Canadian space projects. With this new organization Canada has been able to construct and launch new projects into orbit. One of the most important Canadian projects is Canadarm which has become used frequently on the International Space Station (or ISS for short). When the headquarters building of the Canadian Space Agency was completed in 1992, it was named the John H. Chapman Space Centre, in his honour. Asteroid (14163) JohnChapman is named after Chapman.

It was adopted by 12 votes to none; Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union abstained, and China did not participate. Background U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 was issued five days after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon on March 14, 1978, in what was referred to as Operation Litani. The stated objective of the operation was to clear out the PLO bases located inside Lebanon south of the Litani River, in order to better secure northern Israel and to support the Christian Lebanese militias in the course of the civil war - most notably the Free Lebanon Army. Following Lebanese government claims, the United Nations, driven by the United States, began seeking a peacekeeping force for the area that Israel had occupied in order to bring about a withdrawal of the Israeli forces, and to reintroduce the authority of the Lebanese government in southern Lebanon. These efforts culminated in Resolution 425, during the 2074th meeting of the United Nations Security Council on March 19, 1978. That led to the formation of UNIFIL, the objective of which was to confirm Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, restore international peace and security, and help the Lebanese Government restore its effective authority in the area. The resolution text Implementation The first UNIFIL troops arrived in Lebanon on March 23, 1978, just four days after the resolution was passed. Israel withdrew its forces by June 1978. Aftermath After continued PLO attacks from south Lebanon, a larger-scale Israeli invasion commenced in June 1982, in which Israeli troops allied with the Lebanese Christian forces and occupied the capital city of Beirut in the 1982 Lebanon War. In May 2000, nearly a quarter century after resolution 425, Israel withdrew its troops from southern Lebanon. Prior to the withdrawal, opposition voices inside Israel pressured the government to withdraw, as they saw no valid reason to stay there and sustain Lebanese attacks. Blue Line covers the Lebanese-Israeli border; an extension covers the Lebanese-Golan Heights border. The UN Secretary-General concluded that, as of June 16, 2000, Israel had indeed withdrawn its forces from Lebanon, in accordance with resolution 425 (1978).18 Jun 2000] SC/6878: Security Council Endorses Secretary-General's Conclusion on Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon as of 16 June The border recognized by the UN is known as the \\"Blue Line\\". Some Lebanese parties (most notably Iranian proxy Hezbollah), however, claim that Israel is still keeping Lebanese land under its occupation, mainly in Shebaa Farms. Israel and the UN concur that Shebaa Farms is part of the Golan (annexed in Israel‚Äôs view, occupied in eyes of UN), and therefore it is not included under resolution 425. The Lebanese Republic has not extended effective control over south Lebanon, though it was called on to do so by UN Resolution 1391 in 2002,Security Council Resolutions - 2002 UN Resolution 1496 2003Resolution 1496 (2003) and UN Resolution 1701 after the second Lebanese War In 2006. Hezbollah periodically attacks Israel through Lebanon. Israel has lodged multiple complaints regarding Lebanon's conduct.

The Senate has 108 members elected for concurrent (non-rotating) four-year terms. Electoral system According to the Colombian Constitution, 100 senators (senadores) are elected from a single national constituency. The remaining two are elected in a special national constituency for Indigenous communities. Colombian citizens living outside the country are eligible to vote, although, unlike in the lower house, they have no special representatives in the Senate. For elections to the Senate in the national constituency, political parties or other movements and groups run single lists, with a number of candidates not exceeding the total number of seats to be filled. The current electoral system, adopted in 2003 and modified in 2009 and 2015, requires party lists to pass a 3% threshold in order to obtain representation. For the 2006 and 2010 elections, the threshold was set at 2%, before being raised by the 2009 reform to 3%. Parties may run a closed list, with the order of candidates pre- determined, or opt for preferential voting (open list), where the position of candidates on the list is reordered based on the individual preference votes of the voters. In senatorial elections, voters choosing a party running a closed list only vote for the party list; voters who choose a party running an open list may indicate their candidate of preference among the names displayed on the ballot, if the voter does not indicate a preference and only votes for the party, the vote is valid for purposes of the threshold but not for reordering the list based on preferential votes. For the two seats reserved to Indigenous communities, the electoral quota system is used (total votes divided by the total seats), with the threshold in this case being 30% of the electoral quota. Eligibility To be a senator, a person must be a natural- born Colombian citizen over the age of 30 at the time of the election. Representatives of indigenous communities seeking election as a representative of indigenous communities in the Senate must have held a traditional authority role in their community or have been the leader of an indigenous organization. There are general rules of ineligibility and incompatibility which apply to both houses of Congress, explained here. In addition, general rules on the replacement and non-replacement of members depending on different circumstances also apply to both houses of Congress. Exclusive powers of the Senate # Approve or reject the resignations of the President and the Vice President. # Approve or reject all military promotions conferred by the government on commissioned officers. # Grant leaves of absence for the President in cases other than sickness, and determine the qualification of the Vice President to serve as President. # Allow for the transit of foreign troops through Colombian territory. # Authorize the Government to declare war on a foreign nation. # Elect the Constitutional Court justices. # Elect the Attorney General. Judicial powers The Congress' judicial powers are divided between the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. The Senate is responsible for taking cognizance of the charges brought by the House of Representatives against the President (or whoever replaces him/her) and members of the Comisi√≥n de Aforados even if they may have ceased to exercise their functions. The Senate determines the validity of the charges concerning actions or omissions that occurred in the exercise of these duties. The Senate may assign the preliminary investigation to a group of its members, but the judgement is pronounced in a public session with at least two-thirds of senators in attendance. In the trials to be conducted before the Senate, the accused is automatically suspended from his/her office once the charges brought have been admitted. If the charge refers to offences committed in the exercise of his/her duties or unworthiness to serve for misconduct, the Senate may only discharge him/her from office and/or temporarily or permanently strip the accused of their political rights. The accused, however, is brought to trial before the Supreme Court of Justice, if the evidence demonstrates the individual to be responsible for an infraction deserving of other penalties. If the charge refers to common crimes, the Senate confines itself to declaring if there are grounds for further measures; in the affirmative, the accused is placed at the disposition of the Supreme Court.

In computer programming, a callback, also known as a \\"call-after\\" function, is any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time. This execution may be immediate as in a synchronous callback, or it might happen at a later time as in an asynchronous callback. Programming languages support callbacks in different ways, often implementing them with subroutines, lambda expressions, blocks, or function pointers.  Design  There are two types of callbacks, differing in how they control data flow at runtime: blocking callbacks (also known as synchronous callbacks or just callbacks) and deferred callbacks (also known as asynchronous callbacks). While blocking callbacks are invoked before a function returns (in the C example below, which illustrates a blocking callback, it is function ), deferred callbacks may be invoked after a function returns. Deferred callbacks are often used in the context of I/O operations or event handling, and are called by interrupts or by a different thread in case of multiple threads. Due to their nature, blocking callbacks can work without interrupts or multiple threads, meaning that blocking callbacks are not commonly used for synchronization or delegating work to another thread. Callbacks are used to program applications in windowing systems. In this case, the application supplies (a reference to) a specific custom callback function for the operating system to call, which then calls this application-specific function in response to events like mouse clicks or key presses. A major concern here is the management of privilege and security: whilst the function is called from the operating system, it should not run with the same privilege as the system. A solution to this problem is using rings of protection. Implementation The form of a callback varies among programming languages: * In assembly, C, C++, Pascal, Modula2 and similar languages, a machine-level pointer to a function may be passed as an argument to another (internal or external) function. This is supported by most compilers and provides the advantage of using different languages together without special wrapper libraries or classes. One example may be the Windows API that is directly (more or less) accessible by many different languages, compilers and assemblers. * C++ allows objects to provide their own implementation of the function call operation. The Standard Template Library accepts these objects (called functors), as well as function pointers, as parameters to various polymorphic algorithms. * Many dynamic languages, such as JavaScript, Lua, Python, Perl and PHP, simply allow a function object to be passed through. * CLI languages such as C# and VB.NET provide a type-safe encapsulating reference, a \\"delegate\\", to define well-typed function pointers. These can be used as callbacks. * Events and event handlers, as used in .NET languages, provide generalized syntax for callbacks. * Functional languages generally support first-class functions, which can be passed as callbacks to other functions, stored as data or returned from functions. * Some languages, such as Algol 68, Perl, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, C++11 and later, newer versions of C# and VB.NET as well as most functional languages, allow unnamed blocks of code (lambda expressions) to be supplied instead of references to functions defined elsewhere. * In some languages, e.g. Scheme, ML, JavaScript, Perl, Smalltalk, PHP (since 5.3.0), C++11 and later, Java (since 8), and many others, such functions can be closures, i.e. they can access and modify variables locally defined in the context in which the function was defined. Note that Java cannot, however, modify the local variables in the enclosing scope. * In object-oriented programming languages without function-valued arguments, such as in Java before its 8 version, callbacks can be simulated by passing an instance of an abstract class or interface, of which the receiver will call one or more methods, while the calling end provides a concrete implementation. Such objects are effectively a bundle of callbacks, plus the data they need to manipulate. They are useful in implementing various design patterns such as Visitor, Observer, and Strategy. Use C Callbacks have a wide variety of uses, for example in error signaling: a Unix program might not want to terminate immediately when it receives SIGTERM, so to make sure that its termination is handled properly, it would register the cleanup function as a callback. Callbacks may also be used to control whether a function acts or not: Xlib allows custom predicates to be specified to determine whether a program wishes to handle an event. The following C code demonstrates the use of callbacks to display two numbers. #include #include /* The calling function takes a single callback as a parameter. */ void PrintTwoNumbers(int (*numberSource)(void)) { int val1 = numberSource(); int val2 = numberSource(); printf(\\"%d and %d \\", val1, val2); } /* A possible callback */ int overNineThousand(void) { return (rand()%1000) + 9001; } /* Another possible callback. */ int meaningOfLife(void) { return 42; } /* Here we call PrintTwoNumbers() with three different callbacks. */ int main(void) { time_t t; srand((unsigned)time(&t;)); // Init seed for random function PrintTwoNumbers(&rand;); PrintTwoNumbers(&overNineThousand;); PrintTwoNumbers(&meaningOfLife;); return 0; } This should provide output similar to: 125185 and 89187225 9084 and 9441 42 and 42 Note how this is different from simply passing the output of the callback function to the calling function, PrintTwoNumbers() - rather than printing the same value twice, the PrintTwoNumbers calls the callback as many times as it requires. This is one of the two main advantages of callbacks. The other advantage is that the calling function can pass whatever parameters it wishes to the called functions (not shown in the above example). This allows correct information hiding: the code that passes a callback to a calling function does not need to know the parameter values that will be passed to the function. If it only passed the return value, then the parameters would need to be exposed publicly. Another example: /* * This is a simple C program to demonstrate the usage of callbacks * The callback function is in the same file as the calling code. * The callback function can later be put into external library like * e.g. a shared object to increase flexibility. * */ #include #include typedef struct _MyMsg { int appId; char msgbody[32]; } MyMsg; void myfunc(MyMsg *msg) { if (strlen(msg->msgbody) > 0 ) printf(\\"App Id = %d Msg = %s \\",msg->appId, msg->msgbody); else printf(\\"App Id = %d Msg = No Msg \\",msg->appId); } /* * Prototype declaration */ void (*callback)(MyMsg *); int main(void) { MyMsg msg1; msg1.appId = 100; strcpy(msg1.msgbody, \\"This is a test \\"); /* * Assign the address of the function \\"myfunc\\" to the function * pointer \\"callback\\" (may be also written as \\"callback = &myfunc;\\") */ callback = myfunc; /* * Call the function (may be also written as \\"(*callback)(&msg1;);\\") */ callback(&msg1;); return 0; } The output after compilation: $ gcc cbtest.c $ ./a.out App Id = 100 Msg = This is a test This information hiding means that callbacks can be used when communicating between processes or threads, or through serialised communications and tabular data.  C#  A simple callback in C#: public class Class1 { static void Main(string[] args) { Class2 c2 = new Class2(); /* * Calling method on Class2 with callback method as parameter */ c2.Method(CallBackMethod); } /* * The callback method. This method prints the string sent in the callback */ static void CallBackMethod(string str) { Console.WriteLine($\\"Callback was: {str}\\"); } } public class Class2 { /* * The method that calls back to the caller. Takes an action (method) as parameter */ public void Method(Action callback) { /* * Calls back to method CallBackMet in Class1 with the message specified */ callback(\\"The message to send back\\"); } } JavaScript Callbacks are used in the implementation of languages such as JavaScript, including support of JavaScript functions as callbacks through js-ctypes and in components such as addEventListener. However, a native example of a callback can be written without any complex code: function calculate(num1, num2, callbackFunction) { return callbackFunction(num1, num2); } function calcProduct(num1, num2) { return num1 * num2; } function calcSum(num1, num2) { return num1 + num2; } // alerts 75, the product of 5 and 15 alert(calculate(5, 15, calcProduct)); // alerts 20, the sum of 5 and 15 alert(calculate(5, 15, calcSum)); First a function is defined with a parameter intended for callback: . Then a function that can be used as a callback to is defined, . Other functions may be used for , like . In this example, is invoked twice, once with as a callback and once with . The functions return the product and sum, respectively, and then the alert will display them to the screen. In this primitive example, the use of a callback is primarily a demonstration of principle. One could simply call the callbacks as regular functions, . Callbacks are generally used when the function needs to perform events before the callback is executed, or when the function does not (or cannot) have meaningful return values to act on, as is the case for Asynchronous JavaScript (based on timers) or XMLHttpRequest requests. Useful examples can be found in JavaScript libraries such as jQuery where the .each() method iterates over an array-like object, the first argument being a callback that is performed on each iteration. Red and REBOL From the JavaScript above, here is how one would implement the same in either REBOL or Red (programming language). Notice the cleaner presentation of data as code. * return is implied as the code in each function is the last line of the block * As alert requires a string, form produces a string from the result of calculate * The get-word! values (i.e., :calc-product and :calc- sum) trigger the interpreter to return the code of the function rather than evaluate with the function. * The datatype! references in a block! [float! integer!] restrict the type of values passed as arguments.

Here is a very trivial example of the use of a callback in Python. First define two functions, the callback and the calling code, then pass the callback function into the calling code. >>> def get_square(val): ... The callback. ... return val ** 2 ... >>> def caller(func, val): ... return func(val) ... >>> caller(get_square, 5) 25 See also * Command pattern * Continuation-passing style * Event loop * Event-driven programming * Implicit invocation * Inversion of control * libsigc++, a callback library for C++ * Signals and slots * User exit  References   External links  * Basic Instincts: Implementing Callback Notifications Using Delegates * Implement callback routines in Java * Implement Script Callback Framework in ASP.NET * Interfacing C++ member functions with C libraries (archived from the original on July 6, 2011) * Style Case Study #2: Generic Callbacks Category:Articles with example C code Category:Subroutines ","title":"Callback (computer programming)"},{"id":"645247","text":"Fenvalerate is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide. It is a mixture of four optical isomers which have different insecticidal activities. The 2-S alpha (or SS) configuration, known as esfenvalerate, is the most insecticidally active isomer. Fenvalerate consists of about 23% of this isomer. Fenvalerate is an insecticide of moderate mammalian toxicity. In laboratory animals, central nervous system toxicity is observed following acute or short-term exposure. Fenvalerate has applications against a wide range of pests including some of the more destructive such as the Helicoverpa assulta. Residue levels are minimized by low application rates. Fenvalerate is most toxic to bees and fish. It is found in some emulsifiable concentrates, ULV, wettable powders, slow release formulations, insecticidal fogs, and granules. It is most commonly used to control insects in food, feed, and cotton products, and for the control of flies and ticks in barns and stables. Fenvalerate does not affect plants, but is active for an extended period of time. Fenvalerate may irritate the skin and eyes on contact, and is also harmful if swallowed.

A graduate of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), Frederick went on to become an officer during the American Revolutionary War. In addition, he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was a United States Senator from New Jersey from 1793 until 1796, and served as the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 1801. Early life He was born near Somerville in the Province of New Jersey to John Frelinghuysen (1727‚Äì1754) of Flatbush, Brooklyn and Dinah Van Berg (1725‚Äì1807) of Amsterdam. His father, John, was the son of the immigrant minister Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen, the progenitor of the Frelinghuysen family in New Jersey. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1770, and was the sole instructor at Queen's College, New Brunswick (now Rutgers University) from 1771 to 1774. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1774, practicing law in Somerset County, New Jersey. Military and political career With the coming of the American Revolution, he became a member of the provincial congress of New Jersey from 1775 to 1776. In the War of Independence he served in the New Jersey militia as an artillery captain, seeing action at Trenton and Monmouth. In 1779 he served as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. He served as a clerk to the Court of Common Pleas of Somerset County, New Jersey from 1781 to 1789. He also served in the New Jersey General Assembly in 1784 and again from 1800 to 1804. He was a member of the New Jersey convention that ratified the United States Constitution in 1787. He was a member of the New Jersey Legislative Council (now the New Jersey Senate) representing Somerset County from 1790 to 1792.

It lies four kilometers east of the temple on Mt. Tohamsan, in Gyeongju, South Korea. It is classified as National Treasure No. 24 by the South Korean government and is located at 994, Jinhyeon-dong, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsanbuk-do. The grotto overlooks the Sea of Japan and rests 750 meters above sea level. In 1962, it was designated the 24th national treasure of Korea. In 1995, Seokguram was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List together with the Bulguksa Temple. It exemplifies some of the best Buddhist sculptures in the world. The Seokguram grotto is said to have been built by Kim Daeseong and originally called Seokbulsa (ÏÑùÎ∂àÏÇ¨, Stone Buddha Temple). Construction began in 742 when Kim Daeseong resigned his position in the king's court or in 751, the 10th year of the reign of King Gyeongdeok of Silla. This time period was the cultural peak of Unified Silla. The grotto was completed by the Silla court in 774, shortly after Kim's death. An old legend stated that Kim was reincarnated for his filial acts in his previous life. The legend relates that the Bulguksa Temple was dedicated to Kim‚Äôs parents in his present life while the Seokguram Grotto was dedicated to Kim's parents from a previous life. The grotto is currently one of the best known cultural destinations in South Korea. A viewing of the sunrise over the sea, which is visible from near the seated Buddha's perch, is especially popular. Architecture The tradition of carving the image of Buddha in stone, holy images, and stupas into cliff walls and natural caves began in India. This practice was transferred to China and then Korea. The geology of the Korean Peninsula, which contains an abundance of hard granite, is not conducive to carving stone images into cliff walls. Seokguram is an artificial grotto made from granite and is unique in design. The small size of the grotto indicates that it was probably used exclusively by the Silla royalty. The Seokguram grotto is symbolic of a spiritual journey into Nirvana. Pilgrims were to start at Bulguksa or at the foot Mt. Tohamsan, a holy mountain to the Silla. There was a fountain at the entrance of the shrine where pilgrims could refresh themselves. Inside the grotto, the antechamber and corridor represented the earth while the rotunda represented heaven. The basic layout of the grotto includes an arched entrance which leads into a rectangular antechamber and then a narrow corridor, which is lined with bas-reliefs, and then finally leads into the main rotunda. The centerpiece of the granite sanctuary is a Buddha statue seated in the main chamber. The identity of the Buddha is still debated. The Buddha is seated on a lotus throne with legs crossed. The Buddha has a serene expression of meditation. The Buddha is surrounded by fifteen panels of bodhisattvas, arhats and ancient Indian gods in the rotunda and is accompanied by ten statues in niches along the rotunda wall. The main hall of Seokguram houses a Bojon statue Bodhisattva and his disciples. Forty different figures representing Buddhist principles and teachings are in the grotto. The grotto was built around these statues to protect them from weathering. The ceiling of the Seokguram grotto is decorated with half moons; the top is decorated with a lotus flower. Silla architects used symmetry and apparently employed the concept of the golden rectangle. The grotto is shaped by hundreds of different granite stones. No mortar was used in its construction; the structure is held together by stone rivets. The construction of the grotto also utilized natural ventilation. The dome of the rotunda is 6.84 meters to 6.58 meters in diameter. Sculpture within the grotto The main Buddha of the grotto is a highly regarded piece of Buddhist art. It is 3.5 meters in height and sits on a 1.34-meter tall lotus pedestal. The Buddha is realistic in form and probably represents the Seokgamoni Buddha; the position of the Buddha's hands symbolizes enlightenment. The Buddha has an usnisa, a symbol of the wisdom. The drapery on the Buddha, such as the fan- shaped folds at the crossed-legs of the Buddha, exemplifies Korean interpretations of Indian prototypes. Unlike other Buddhas that have a halo attached to the back of the head, the Buddha at Seokguram creates the illusion of a halo by placing a granite roundel carved with lotus petals on the back wall of the rotunda. The pedestal is made of three parts; the top and bottom are carved with lotus petals while the central shaft consists of eight pillars. Accompanying the main Buddha, in relief, are three bodhisattvas, ten disciples, and two Hindu gods along the wall of the rotunda. Ten statues of bodhisattvas, saints, and the faithful are located in niches above the bas- reliefs. The ten disciples were disciples of Seokgamoni and are lined five on each side of the Avalokitesvara. Their features suggest a Greek influence. The two bodhisattvas are of Manjusri and Samantabhadra. The two Hindu gods are Brahma and Indra. The Four Heavenly Kings guard the corridor. There are also images of Vajrapanis, which are guardian figures and they are on the walls of the entrance to the corridor, in the antechamber. Eight Guardian Deities adorn the antechamber. Another notable figure is the Eleven-faced Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. It is on the back wall of the rotunda and stands 2.18 meters in height. This figure is the only one of the bas-reliefs facing forward; the others face the side. The Avalokitesvara wears a crown, is dressed in robes and jewelry and holds a vase containing a lotus blossom. Two statues from the niches and a marble pagoda that was believed to have stood in front of the Avalokitesvara are missing from the grotto and are believed to have been looted by the Japanese. Reconstruction Because of the long periods of abandonment and numerous renovations, many details are disputed amongst scholars, such as the exact layout of the original grotto, the buildings in Bulguksa or the shape of the watercourse, which no longer exists, in front of the temple. Repair and improvements were undertaken in 1703 and 1758, during the Joseon dynasty. However, Confucian-oriented rulers suppressed Buddhism, and the remote mountain grotto was seriously damaged by the turn of the 20th century. The Government-General of Chosen conducted restoration works three times, but faced humidity and other problems. Japan did the first round of repairs from 1913 to 1915. These repairs were conducted without sufficient study of the structure of the grotto. During Japanese cleaning efforts, the structure of the grotto was almost completely dismantled and reassembled. A major mistake committed by the Japanese was their attempt to stabilize the structure by encasement in concrete, which was yet, the most advanced technology at the time. This resulted in humidity buildup and in water leaks, and caused erosion of the sculptures because the grotto could no longer \\"breathe.\\" In 1917, drainage pipes were buried above the dome to channel rainwater away from the grotto. However, as leaks continued in spite of the pipes, another round of repairs was conducted from 1920‚Äì1923. Waterproof asphalt was applied to the surface of the concrete, which only worsened the problem. Moss and mold formed, and in 1927 the now unthinkable method of spraying hot steam was used to clean the sculptures. After World War II, in the 1960s, President Park Chung Hee ordered a major restoration project. The problem of temperature and humidity control was resolved to an extent by using mechanical systems. The wooden superstructure built over the antechamber remains a subject for debate for many historians who believe Seokguram originally did not have such a structure blocking the view of the sunrise over the ocean, and cutting off the air flow into the grotto. The interior of the grotto can now only be viewed through a glass wall, installed to protect it from the many tourists it attracts, as well as temperature change.

He began a long career with the CBS network starting in radio from 1937 and then a television host on several variety and game shows from 1949 through to the mid 1970s. After dropping out of high school, Moore found success as a radio host and then moved on to the medium of television. He hosted several daytime and prime time programs titled The Garry Moore Show, and the game shows I've Got a Secret and To Tell the Truth. He was instrumental in furthering the career of comedic actress Carol Burnett. He became known for his bow ties and his crew cut fashion early in his career. After being diagnosed with throat cancer in 1976, Moore retired from the broadcasting industry, only making a few rare television appearances. He spent the last years of his life in Hilton Head, South Carolina and at his summer home in Northeast Harbor in Maine. He died on November 28, 1993, at the age of 78. Early life and radio career Moore was born on January 31, 1915, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Mason P. Morfit and Mary L. (n√©e Harris) Morfit. He attended Baltimore City College (actually a high school), but dropped out to pursue a career in radio and writing. Starting in 1937, he worked for Baltimore radio station WBAL as an announcer, writer and actor/comedian. He used his birth name until 1940, when, while on the air announcing Club Matinee hosted by Ransom Sherman at NBC, Chicago, Sherman held a radio contest to find a more easily pronounceable one. \\"Garry Moore\\" was the winning entry, which was submitted by a woman from Pittsburgh who received a prize of $100. It was on Club Matinee where he met his long- time friend and broadcasting partner Durward Kirby. Moore headed Talent, Ltd., a variety program on Sunday afternoons in 1941. In the years that followed, Moore appeared on numerous network radio shows. He started out as an announcer and then as support for broadcast personalities, one of whom was Jimmy Durante. From 1943-47, Durante and Moore had a joint show with Moore as the straight man.The Jimmy Durante And Garry Moore Show, NBC (1943), CBS (1943-1947): Impressed with his ability to interact with audiences, CBS offered him his own show. Starting in 1949, the one-hour daytime variety show The Garry Moore Show aired on CBS. Moore briefly returned to radio as host of NBC's Monitor in 1969. Television career Between 1947 and 1950, Moore began to make tentative steps into the new medium as a panelist and guest host on quiz and musical shows. On June 26, 1950, he was rewarded with his own 30-minute CBS early-evening talk-variety TV program, The Garry Moore Show, which was a shorter version of his radio show. Until September 1950, it was also simulcast on radio. During 1950 and 1951, he hosted prime-time variety hour summer replacements for Arthur Godfrey and his Friends. He appeared as a guest star on other programs including CBS's Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town. During his run as a variety-show host, Moore was tapped to host CBS' weekly prime-time TV panel show I've Got a Secret. It premiered on June 19, 1952. On this show, Moore began his friendships with comedian Henry Morgan and game show host and panelist Bill Cullen, with whom he had a long working relationship. Morgan later stated that Moore had helped him keep his job as a television host. > One night I was doing my own local TV show and, in lighting a cigarette, I > remarked that I was creating my own cancer.

His writings cover a variety of topics, from scholarly works on eighteenth-century English literature to commentary on America's class system. Fussell served in the 103rd Infantry Division during World War II and was wounded in fighting in France. Returning to the US, Fussell wrote extensively and held several faculty positions, most prominently at Rutgers University (1955-1983) and at the University of Pennsylvania (1983-1994). He is best known for his writings about World War I and II, which explore what he felt was the gap between the romantic myth and reality of war; he made a \\"career out of refusing to disguise it or elevate it\\". Biography Born and raised in Pasadena, California, Fussell was the second of three children. His father, Paul Fussell (1895‚Äì1973), son of a widowed schoolteacher, became a corporate lawyer in Los Angeles with the firm of O'Melveny & Myers.

Biography  Ross Winn was born in Texas in 1871. Prior to beginning his own publishing efforts, Winn frequently wrote articles for other radical papers. Winn's earliest known published writing appears in the January, 1894 issue of Twentieth Century. He was 23 when he wrote the piece, a plea for cooperation between socialists and anarchists. In a later piece, appearing in Free Society in December, 1900, Winn mentions becoming a \\"young convert\\" in realizing his own radical political notions twelve years earlier, when he was only 17 years old. It is likely that Winn, like many other anarchists of the time, became politicized by the execution of the Haymarket martyrs. Winn also wrote articles for The Firebrand, a short-lived, but renowned weekly out of Portland, Oregon; The Rebel, an anarchist journal published in Boston; and Emma Goldman's Mother Earth.Slifer, Shaun and Ally Reeves (Summer 2004). \\"Ross Winn: Digging Up a Tennessee Anarchist\\". Fifth Estate, pp. 55-57. Sometime in 1894, Winn began his first paper, known as Co- operative Commonwealth. He then edited and published Coming Era for a brief time in 1898 and then Winn's Freelance in 1899. Later in 1899, Winn took over publication of Free Society and discontinued Coming Era and Winn's Freelance. In 1902, he announced a new paper called Winn's Firebrand. It's likely he fancied the name of the then-defunct weekly. His vision was for a paper that would appeal to people of all classes. According to Winn, it would be \\"just the kind of literature for missionary work among the masses\\". Winn considered the printed word as the most effective tool for social awakening, and saw the dissemination of anti-authoritarian ideals, especially in the conservative South, as his distinct calling. In 1900, Tennessee became his base of operation: \\"In establishing the magazine (in Mt. Juliet), as an independent publication, the flag of revolutionary thought is planted on Southern soil, and a residence of a lifetime in this section convinces me that it will be a fruitful field for libertarian ideas, if the right methods are used to present them.\\" Winn and his future wife Augusta \\"Gussie\\" Smith moved into her family home in Mt. Juliet, the Warner Price Mumford Smith House. In 1901, Winn met Emma Goldman in Chicago, and found in her a lasting ally. As she wrote in his obituary, Emma \\"was deeply impressed with his fervor and complete abandonment to the cause, so unlike most American revolutionists, who love their ease and comfort too well to risk them for their ideals.\\" Winn kept up a correspondence with Goldman throughout his life, as he did with other prominent anarchist writers at the time. Joseph Labadie, a prominent writer and organizer in Michigan, was another friend to Winn, and contributed several pieces to Winn's Firebrand in its later years. Also in 1901, Winn married Augusta Smith, and they soon had their first and only child, Ross Winn, Jr. Sometime in 1909, Ross Winn contracted tuberculosis (then known as \\"consumption\\"), but continued his work on Firebrand despite his failing health. In 1910, he moved briefly to Texas with his wife, Augusta (known as \\"Gussie\\"), in search of work. Unable to find work, and having gotten himself deeper into debt, Winn sold his printing setup and moved back to Mt. Juliet. In July 1911, Gussie wrote a letter, in secret, to Emma Goldman asking for any possible financial assistance from their allies, knowing that her husband \\"would rather starve than to beg\\".Winn, Augusta. Letter to Emma Goldman. July 12, 1911. Emma Goldman Papers. Special Collections Library - Labadie Collection, University of Michigan. Word was sent out around the country and, all told, some $60 was raised, quite a sum for a small family at that time. Rather than spending the money on himself or his family, however, Winn spent the majority of the money on a new printing setup and began what was to be his last paper, known as The Advance. On August 8, 1912, the degenerative infection of tuberculosis finally took Winn's life. He was still setting type on the August issue of The Advance the day before he died.

The World Summit set the stage for a decade of high level commitment on issues concerning children around the world and it set the stage for a series of UN conferences throughout the 1990s on population, environment, food, human rights, social development and women's rights.  Origin of project  The Summit was proposed in 1989 by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, President Moussa Traore of Mali, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, and Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden. These six leaders worked together \\"to bring attention and promote commitment, at the highest political level, to goals and strategies for ensuring the survival, protection and development of children as key elements in the socio-economic development of all countries and human society\\". The United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar adopted the project and gave the Summit the support of the UNICEF and other UN organizations. A total 159 governments were invited to the event. In attendance were heads of state from 72 different countries, as well as representatives from 87 other nations. The Summit agenda was highly endorsed by three main organizations- the World Health Assembly, Education for All (led by UNESCO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Executive Board. UNICEF was the main contributor. Every year following the Summit, it conducted progress reports on the implementation of Summit goals and released them through its many publications. The World Summit for Children was held at a moment when the world was just beginning to demonstrate united interest in children's survival and development. A year prior the Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted. It is a human rights treaty focused directly on the rights of children. The document had entered into force just a couple of weeks before the Summit was held.  Goals established  There were 27 total goals established. The main objective was to improve child health and survival. The goals can be divided into six categories: health, survival, women's health, nutrition, education and protection. These goals were put into action from 1990-2000. After the ten-year period, world leaders would meet again to review the progress made during the decade.  Health  There were nine health goals established. # Polio: global eradication by 2000 # Neonatal tetanus: elimination by 1995 # Deaths due to diarrhoea: 50 percent reduction # Vitamin A deficiency: virtual elimination by the year 2000 # Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD): virtual elimination # Elimination of guinea-worm disease (Dracunculiasis) by 2000 # Measles: reduction by 95 percent in measles deaths and 90 percent of measles cases by 1995 # Anemia: reduction of iron deficiency Anemia in women by one-third # Routine immunization: maintenance of a high level of immunization coverage  Survival  Street child in Bangladesh # Infant and under-5 mortality (U5MR): reduction by one third in infant mortality and U5MR # Household food security: dissemination of knowledge and supporting services to increase food production # Acute respiratory infections (Influenza-like illness): reduction of ARI deaths by one third in children under five  Women's health  # Childbirth care: access by all pregnant women to prenatal care # Breastfeeding: empowerment of all women to breastfeed their children exclusively for four to six months and to continue breastfeeding, with complementary food, well into the second year of life # Childbirth care: access by all pregnant women to referral facilities for high- risk pregnancies and obstetric emergencies # Special attention to the health and nutrition of the female child and to pregnant and lactating women # Maternal mortality: reduction of the rate by half # Low birth-weight: reduction of the rate of low birth-weight to less than 10 percent A girl during the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s. Pictures of the famine caused by Nigerian blockade garnered sympathy for the Biafrans worldwide.  Nutrition  # Malnutrition: reduction of severe and moderate malnutrition among under-five children by half # Water: universal access to safe drinking water  Education  # Family planning: access by all couples to information and services to prevent pregnancies that are too early, too closely spaced, too late, or too numerous # Knowledge skills and values required for better living: increased acquisition by individuals and families of knowledge, skills and values for better living # Universal access to basic education: achievement of primary education by at least 80% of primary school- age children # Universal access to education with an emphasis on primary education for girls and literacy training for women # Early childhood development (ECD): expansion of ECD activities, including appropriate low-cost family and community-based interventions  Protection  # Improve protection of children in extremely difficult circumstances # Growth monitoring: growth promotion and regular growth monitoring among children to be institutionalized in all countries by the end of the 1990s  Laws established  The high point of the Summit was the joint signing of the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children and a Plan of Action on September 30, 1990. The World Declaration on the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children served as a written commitment to children worldwide. It summarizes the reason for the Summit and the goals established. The Plan of Action is a supplement to the World Declaration. It outlines how goals are to be met.  World declaration  The World Declaration of the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children is subdivided into five categories: The Challenge, The Opportunity, The Task, The Commitment, and The Next Step. * The Challenge: To help countless children around the world who are exposed to dangers that hamper their growth and development. In particular those that are victims of poverty, malnutrition, war, and disease. * The Opportunity: Declares that the fulfillment of the Summit goals will be an international co-operation, and leaders worldwide must implement the obligations agreed upon to on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention on the Rights of the Child was signed in 1989; it was the first international treaty to guarantee civil and political rights as well as economic, social, and cultural rights. The United States and South Sudan are the only countries who have not ratified the Convention. * The Task and The Commitment: Both of these serve to further explain the specific goals of the Summit. ** Improve Children's Health ** Improve Prenatal Health ** To strengthen the role and status of women ** To provide educational opportunities ** To ameliorate the lives of homeless, refugee, disabled, and abused children ** To protect children from the dangers of war ** To work for a global attack on poverty * The Next Step: The adoption of The Plan of Action to specify how the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children will be realized.  Plan of action  The Plan of Action is a framework for more specific national and international undertakings. It addresses every goal individually to ensure the implementation of the Declaration of the World Summit for Children. It also concentrates on the follow-up and monitoring of the progression towards accomplishing each goal. The primary responsibility for the implementation of all goals was given to National Governments. Each country agreed to develop strategies through National Programs of Action to make sure these 27 global goals could become national realities. A total of 155 countries developed National Programs of Action.  Special session  U. N. headquarters in New York City Children at The Special Session on Children The Special Session on Children was a meeting the UN General Assembly held May 8‚Äì10, 2002. It was held to review the progress made for children in the decade since the 1990 World Summit for Children. It also served as a method to renew the commitments made in 1990, and to make a pledge for specific actions for the coming decade. In total about 70 Heads of State and/or Government attended the Session. Children from all around the world where invited to attend. They participated in numerous supporting events. One of the more important events was the Celebration of Leadership for Children held on May 9. The event encompassed a sense of unity and created a festive nature for the Session, but the real reason for the gathering was not forgotten. The World Summit stands out from any other United Nations gathering because of its soundly set goals and its systematic follow up procedure. The Secretary-General‚Äôs report on children, titled \\"We the Children\\" uses data taken from 135 countries and is based on reviews conducted at the national level. It was the most comprehensive study of what was happening to the world‚Äôs children at that time. \\"We the Children\\" is a statistical representation of the minimal progress made in the decade. The report states, ‚ÄúThe world has fallen short of achieving most of the goals of the World Summit for Children\\". Few of the goals established could be labeled as successes, others showed progress, but the majority were not met. Success * Polio: global eradication by 2000 * Neonatal tetanus: elimination by 1995 * Deaths due to diarrhea: 50 percent reduction * Vitamin A deficiency: virtual elimination by the year 2000 * Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD): virtual elimination * Elimination of guinea-worm disease(Dracunculiasis) by 2000 Some progress * Infant and under-5 mortality: reduction by one third in infant mortality and Under-5 mortality * Measles: reduction by 95 percent in measles deaths and 90 percent of measles cases by 1995 as a major step to global eradication * Malnutrition: reduction of severe and moderate malnutrition among under-five children by half * Breastfeeding: empowerment of all women to breastfeed their children exclusively for four to six months and to continue breastfeeding, with complementary food, well into the second year of life * Low birth-weight: reduction of the rate of low birth-weight to less than 10% * Family planning: access by all couples to information and services to prevent pregnancies that are too early, too closely spaced, too late or too numerous * Childbirth care: access by all pregnant women to prenatal care * Water: universal access to safe drinking water * Universal access to basic education: achievement of primary education by at least 80% of primary school-age children * Universal access to education with an emphasis on primary education for girls and literacy training for women * Early childhood development (ECD): expansion of ECD activities, including appropriate low-cost family and community-based interventions * Improve protection of children in extremely difficult circumstances No progress * Routine immunization: maintenance of a high level of immunization coverage * Maternal mortality: reduction of the rate by half * Anemia: reduction of iron deficiency Anemia in women by one-third Limited data * There was limited or inconclusive data on the remaining 6 goals \\"We the Children\\" places the blame to meet goals on financial barriers. Critics note that in many United Nations conferences, goals are ever set but never met, and that commitments on paper are rarely translated into actions. The Canadian Medical Association Journal attributes the lack of progress to the fact that documents emerging from UN conferences are policy documents rather than legal instruments or binding treaties, but it also remarks that the Special Session on Children will set the direction for international policy with respect to children for the next decade.

Based in New York City, the magazine was founded by Kurt Andersen and E. Graydon Carter, who served as its first editors, and Thomas L. Phillips, Jr., its first publisher. Spy specialized in irreverent and satirical pieces targeting the American media and entertainment industries and mocking high society. Overview Some of its features attempted to present the darker side of celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Steven Seagal, Martha Stewart, and especially, the real-estate tycoon Donald Trump and his then-wife Ivana Trump. Pejorative epithets of celebrities, e.g., \\"Abe 'I'm Writing As Bad As I Can' Rosenthal,\\" \\"short-fingered vulgarian Donald Trump,\\" \\"churlish dwarf billionaire Laurence Tisch,\\" \\"bum-kissing toady Arthur Gelb,\\" \\"bosomy dirty-book writer Shirley Lord,\\" and \\"former fat girl Dianne Brill\\" became a Spy trademark. In the summer of 1992, the publication ran a story on President George H.W. Bush's alleged extramarital affairs. The following year, it ran an article entitled \\"Clinton's First 100 Lies\\", detailing what it described as the new president's pattern of duplicitous behavior. In March 1989, Spy published \\"The Pickup Artist's Guide to Picking Up Women: A Case-by-Case Look at Movie Director James Toback's Street Technique.\\" It was written by Vincenza Demetz and included accounts from thirteen women‚Äîincluding the author‚Äîwho accused Toback of sexual misconduct. Features Introduced in the May 1987 issue, Private Lives of Public Enemies (renamed Private Lives of Public Figures, then simply Private Lives in 1989) presented fictional representations of public personalities in unflattering situations. Separated at Birth?, first presented in a feature article in December 1987, was a regular section which would present juxtaposed photos of two different personalities exhibiting visual similarity, to comical effect. The first of each pair was typically a public figure or celebrity, and the second was usually another such figure, but sometimes (usually in the last set) a more absurd subject such as a fictional character, animal, or inanimate object. Separated at Birth? became one of the magazine's most popular features and was spun out into a set of paperback books. Legacy In October 2006, Miramax Books published Spy: The Funny Years (), a greatest-hits anthology and history of the magazine created and compiled by Carter, Andersen, and one of their original editors, George Kalogerakis. In January 2015, after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, Donald Trump made a series of tweets attacking both Spy and Charlie Hebdo, calling Spy a \\"rag magazine\\" In October 2016, Esquire magazine produced a special online version of Spy during the last thirty days of the presidential campaign.

International calling  A callback, in this sense is a method of making low- cost international calls via a third country, usually the United States, where call charges are considerably lower. One variation of this technology was developed by IDT Corporation in 1991. IDT Corp used a hardware solution that was never widely accepted and ultimately failed and was surpassed by a software solution concurrently developed by Jorge Blanco at MCI Telecommunications for The United Nations Development Programme and their staff Wolfgang Scholtes and Kumar Navaratnum. In order to use a callback service, a subscriber is allocated a unique number in, for example, the US, which must first be dialled in order to trigger a return call. This is known (in the US) as a Direct Inbound Dialing (DID) number, or in the UK as a Direct Dial-In (DDI) number. Where Caller ID is available, it may be possible to use the same DID number for many different subscribers, as the callback system will be able to recognise each subscriber's registered number. On hearing a ringing tone, the subscriber simply hangs up and awaits the callback. On receiving this, usually within a few seconds, the customer picks up the phone and dials the required number. This may mean dialling in the North American format, as most callback services are US-based, and callers are effectively calling from the US. For example, a number in Manhattan would be dialled with the trunk code, area code and subscriber's number, as follows: 1 212 xxx xxxx A call to London in the UK, would require the international access code and country calling code, as follows: 011 44 20 xxxx xxxx In the North American Numbering Plan, 011 is used as the international access code, but in most countries, 00 is used, in line with International Telecommunication Union's Recommendation E.164. The cost of making a telephone call via callback consists of two parts, as the caller is effectively paying for an outbound and inbound call at the same time. For example, if a customer from Spain is calling a phone number in Australia, and it costs 8 cents per minute to phone Spain from the US (the callback, which is an incoming call) and 20 cents per minute to phone Australia from the US (the destination call, which is an outgoing call), then the caller will pay a total of 28 US cents a minute. This may still be less expensive than calling directly from Spain to Australia, which is primarily why callbacks are used.  Automated applications  Callback is often automated through the use of web callback or mobile phone applications by companies such as GlobalTel and Jajah, or on Roaming SIMs.  Legal status of callback  Many countries have banned callback services, on the grounds that they are not licensed or regulated by their governments, and deprive telephone companies in many developing countries of revenue from international calls. People who provide or use callback services have argued that these telephone companies are often state monopolies that charge unjustifiably high prices for international calls. It may also be the only way of making calls to certain countries from others, for example, Israel from other Middle Eastern countries. Other countries have sought to use technical means to prevent callback, by blocking the inbound and outbound calls made to and from DID numbers, or by disabling touch tone dialing. However, this is also overcome by the use of speed dial numbers, while others use these services by triggering callback via the Internet or SMS. The use of callback in most developed countries has declined, owing to the liberalization of telecommunication services, which allow more direct access to low-cost international calls, without the need for a time-consuming process like callback. Also, the advent of Voice over Internet Protocol services has allowed many people to make international calls via their computer connected to the Internet, although sound quality can be poorer on slower dial-up connections than on broadband ones. International callback has been credited with opening global telecom markets because it enabled competition to start up even if regulatory restrictions existed. It was popularized by a 1994 book, \\"The International CallBack Book\\" by Gene Retske.  Modem security  A modem allows one computer (the client) to establish a connection to another (the server) by dialing the server's telephone number. This is sometimes viewed as being insecure because there is no authentication of the call originator. One way to increase security is to enforce a modem callback protocol, which usually proceeds as a series of steps: # The client computer calls the server computer. # After a greeting the client identifies itself, usually with a user name. # The server then disconnects the call. # Based upon the user name and a list of users' phone numbers, the server will then establish a second call back to the client computer. # The client computer, expecting this returned call, will then answer and communications between the two computers will proceed normally. Sometimes callback modem setups can also be used for billback purposes, allowing the originator to avoid lengthy toll charges.

After 20 weeks, abortion is permitted only if a health practitioner deems it \\"clinically appropriate\\" and consults at least one other health practitioner. Abortion is only illegal if a person who is not a licensed health practitioner procures or performs an abortion. Current legislation Abortion in New Zealand is regulated by four laws: the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977 (CS&A; Act 1977), the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003, and Section 38 of the Care of Child Act 2004. A woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant may seek abortion from a health practitioner. A woman seeking an abortion past 20 weeks must obtain approval from a health practitioner, who decides whether the procedure is \\"clinically appropriate\\" and consults with at least one other qualified practitioner. Prior to 24 March 2020, women in New Zealand could only seek an abortion after consulting two health practitioners. Abortion Legislation Act 2020 The Abortion Legislation Act 2020 amends two existing laws: the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977 and the Crimes Act 1961. While the Abortion Legislation Act's initially introduced safe zones around abortion providers, it was eliminated from the final version of the law. *Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977: It replaces Sections 10 to 46 of the CS&A; Act 1977 with Sections 10‚Äì14 and Sections 19‚Äì21. The amended bill also abolishes the Abortion Supervisory Committee, the former regulatory body that reported to Parliament, and gives its former responsibilities to the Minister of Health and the Director-General of Health. **Section 10: A qualified health practitioner may provide abortion services to a woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant. **Section 11: After 20 weeks, a health practitioner can only provide abortion services to a woman if it is deemed clinically appropriate and if they consult at least one other qualified practitioner. **Section 13: A health practitioner must advise a woman of the availability of counselling services if the woman seeks advice on whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy; advises the health practitioner of her intention to terminate the pregnancy; or has terminated pregnancy. **Section 14: A health practitioner cannot coerce a woman into seeking counselling as a condition for procuring an abortion. **Section 19: A health practitioner with a conscientious objection to abortion must inform the patient and provide them with information on accessing alternative abortion providers. **Section 20: Employer providing certain services must accommodate conscientious objection of applicant or employee unless it would cause unreasonable disruption. Abortion is regulated by the Ministry of Health and the Director-General of Health, which oversee the collection and publication of information relating to abortion services and providers. Section 20F states that the New Zealand Parliament opposes abortion for the sole purpose of sex-selection, but does not prohibit the practice. **Section 21: The Governor-General has the authority to direct the Director-General of Health to collection information relating to the regulation of abortion services stated in Section 20. *Crimes Act 1961: Abortion is eliminated from the Crimes Act. The Abortion Legislation Act replaces Sections 182A to 187A with Section 183, which states that abortion is only an offense if a person who is not a health practitioner procures or performs an abortion on a woman. The woman is not guilty of the offense. Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 This allows for conscientious objection by medical professionals. Care of Child Act 2004 Section 38 of the Care of Child Act 2004 allows a young woman under the age of 16 to consent to an abortion but that she must still go through the process outlined in the CS&A; Act 1977. History 19th century and early 20th century English law, applied in New Zealand in 1840, outlawed abortion. In 1867, the New Zealand Parliament made it an offence to cause a miscarriage. Under the law, abortionists were considered criminals while the woman seeking an abortion was considered an accomplice to the crime. If a woman induced her own abortion, she was considered a criminal under the law. Therapeutic abortions were available under limited circumstances such as when the mother's life or mental health was in serious danger. During the late 1930s, this right was extended by a court judgment. However, abortion was still strongly frowned upon by society with many doctors refusing to perform terminations. In 1936 the First Labour Government of New Zealand set up a committee, led by D.G. McMillan, to inquire about the incidence of septic abortion in New Zealand. The report estimated that at least 13 in every 100 pregnancies ended in criminal abortion, that number having increased over the five years prior. In the same time period, while maternal deaths had dropped, the number of deaths due to septic abortions had increased, accounting for two-fifths of total maternal mortality. Based on evidence heard before the committee, it was found that a major reason for abortions was a change in social outlook, \\"particularly towards the rearing of large families\\" and \\"an attitude of pitying superiority towards the woman with many children.\\" Other reasons included lack of suitable housing in cities, lack of help for women in performing domestic labour, and the widespread use of ineffective methods of contraception. In the 1930s, Isabel Annie Aves was tried four times for \\"unlawfully using an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage\\" without conviction. In the 1940s, activists such as Alice Bush advocated for access to doctor-provided abortions. Changing attitudes, 1960s‚Äì1970s Following the Second World War, the Sexual Revolution during the 1960s led a change in societal attitudes towards matters of sex, birth control, and motherhood including abortion. These also gave rise to the emergence of Second-wave feminism and the Women's liberation movement during the 1960s and 1970s. Between 1965 and 1970, the number of abortions performed in public hospitals jumped from 70 in 1965 to more than 300 by 1970. Public debate increased following the legalisation of abortion in Britain in 1967, and court decisions in Australia in 1967 and 1970 legalising abortion. The legalisation of abortion in Australia enabled New Zealand women who could afford to travel there to have abortions in Australia. Growing public awareness and debate about abortion led to the emergence of rival anti-abortion and abortion rights groups. Early anti-abortion groups included the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Children (SPUC) and REPEAL while early abortion rights groups included the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand (ALRANZ) and the more militant Women's National Abortion Action Campaign (WONAAC). According to McCulloch, several Socialist Action League members including Kay Goodger were involved in the formation of WONAAC. During the 1970s, the Catholic Church, conservative Protestant denominations, and the Mormons opposed abortion. By contrast, the Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian denominations took a more liberal stance; which generated controversy among their members. In addition, abortion attracted bipartisan support from some members of the New Zealand Parliament including Labour MPs Mary Batchelor and Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan, and National MPs George Gair and Marilyn Waring. The first abortion clinic in New Zealand was the Auckland Medical Aid Centre (AMAC), which opened in 1974 and introduced the practice of vacuum aspiration to New Zealand. By the end of its first year, it had provided 2,288 women with abortions. By 1975, this figure had risen to 4,005. AMAC attracted opposition from anti-abortion activists including arson attacks. The New Zealand Police also raided AMAC in 1974, leading to the prosecution and acquittal of one of its doctors, Jim Woolnough. Decriminalising abortion, 1977‚Äì1978 In response to AMAC, the New Zealand Parliament passed Labour MP and SPUC member's Gerard Wall's Hospitals Amendment Act 1975 which limited the provision of abortion services to licensed hospitals. While AMAC was forced to close, it later reopened in 1980 after buying a private hospital. The Hospitals Amendment Act was later invalidated on technical grounds. In response to the closure of AMAC, abortion rights activists established the Sisters Overseas Service (SOS), which helped women travel to Australia for abortion operations in 1978 and 1979. McCulloch estimates that SOS chapters across New Zealand including Auckland and Wellington sent between 4,000 and 4,500 women to Australia for abortion operations during that period. National Party MP Frank Gill later tried to entrench Wall's bill through the Health Amendment Bill 1976 but pro-abortion rights Labour MP George Gair managed to pass an amendment deferring it by twelve months. In response to growing public debate around abortion, Parliament set up a Royal Commission on Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion to consider public policy on these issues. At the Commission's recommendations, the Third National Government passed the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977 (CS&A; Act 1977) on 15 December 1978, which established the legal framework for abortion in New Zealand. Under the CS&A; Act, a woman seeking abortion had to see their doctor and the two medical consultants, who would assess the mental and physical grounds for carrying out an abortion. A surgeon would also be needed to perform an abortion. Counselling was also made available to women seeking an abortion. The CS&A; Act also established an Abortion Supervisory Committee to regulate the certifying consultants responsible for permitting abortions. The Act also required district health boards to fund abortions. During the late 1970s and 1980s, several public and private abortion clinics were opened in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. The CS&A; Act was criticized by the feminist group Campaign to Oppose Repressive Abortion Laws (CORAL) and WONAAC as being too restrictive and infringing on women's reproductive rights. In 1977, the Government also amended the Crimes Act 1961 to allow abortion within the 20 weeks gestation period. After 20 weeks, abortion was permitted on the grounds of saving the mother's life and preventing serious permanent injury to her mental and physical health. In 1978, the Government further amended the Crimes Act to permit abortion on the grounds of saving the mother's life, mental health, and physical health; foetal abnormality within the 20 weeks gestation period; and incest or sexual intercourse with guardians and family members. In 1986, the Crimes Act was further amended to take into account factors like the extremes of age and sexual violation. Post decriminalisation, 1977‚Äì1990s Following the decriminalisation of abortion, ALRANZ lobbied several hospital boards into establishing more abortion clinics and services. In November 1978, Epsom Day clinic opened in Auckland in November 1978. This was followed by the establishment of Wellington's Parkview Clinic in July 1980 and Christchurch's Lyndhurst Hospital in January 1986. Together with AMAC, these three clinics have provided the vast majority of abortions in New Zealand. ALRANZ and other abortion rights groups shifted their attention to lobbying for sex education in schools and easing young people's access to contraceptives. In response, anti-abortion activists and groups picketed abortion clinics and joined forces with socially-conservative moral groups including Moral Rearmament, Family Rights Association, Society for the Protection of Community Standards (SPCS), and \\"Family 75\\" during the late 1970s and 1980s. SPUC was at the forefront of opposing abortion during the 1980s. In 1980, SPUC secured the removal of two members of the Abortion Supervisory Committee on the grounds that they had been promoting abortion by encouraging hospital boards to establish abortion services. That same year, two SPUC‚Äìbacked candidates were elected to the Wellington hospital board. In 1981, the president of SPUC's Dunedin branch, John O'Neill sought injunctions on behalf of men who wanted to stop their lovers or partners from having abortions. In three of these cases, the women involved managed to obtain their abortions before the courts could intervene. When a judge imposed an interim injunction against an abortion an hour after it had taken place, WONAAC and Alranz staged a protest outside the Court of Appeal in Wellington to protest the judge's action. In 1982, SPUC also unsuccessfully lobbied for all fetuses to be officially registered in the national Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages. In 1982, a New Plymouth pediatrician Melvyn Wall sought a judicial review of a decision by two certifying consultants to allow an abortion for a fifteen-year-old girl, alleging that they had acted in \\"bad faith.\\" Wall's motion was dismissed on the grounds that he had no right to mount the challenge and that decisions by certifying consultants were deemed not open to review. While SPUC's President Marilyn Pryor regarded Wall v. Livingston as a major loss for anti-abortion advocates, ALRANZ welcomed the ruling for upholding women's access to abortion services. WONAAC also successfully appealed to the Medical Practitioners' Disciplinary Committee for Wall to be censured on the grounds that he had violated patient confidentiality. Wall was also fined NZ$1,500. While Wall had the censure revoked, the Medical Council found him liable for professional misconduct and added $500 in costs to the original amount. In 1983, National Member of Parliament Doug Kidd, with the support of SPUC, introduced a private member's bill called the Status of the Unborn Child Bill. In response, the feminist National Member of Parliament Marilyn Waring introduced the pro-abortion rights Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Repeal Bill to challenge Kidd's bill. Waring also leaked news about Kidd's affair with a parliamentary secretary to WONAAC. Ultimately, both Kidd and Waring's bills were defeated and no changes were made to existing abortion legislation. While Pryor blamed the Status of the Unborn Child Bill's hasty introduction for its defeat, abortion rights journalist Alison McCulloch has attributed the bill's defeat to both Waring's counter-bill and Kidd's affair. In 1987, O'Neill of SPUC appeared before the New Zealand Parliament's Justice and Law Reform Committee and demanded the dismissal of the Abortion Supervisory Committee (including the two SPUC‚Äìbacked members) on the grounds they had failed to carry out their functions. That same year, Leo Buchanan, the medical superintendent of Masterton hospital refused to apply for a renewal of the hospital's license to provide abortion services, citing his conscientious objection to abortion. Buchanan's actions effectively ended abortion services in the Wairarapa region. In 1991, O'Neill challenged the validity of abortion licenses throughout New Zealand, leading to the temporary suspension of abortion operations in Dunedin and Waikato for several days. The Otago Health Board's abortion license was suspended on the grounds of a legal technicality connected with the change from the Hospitals Act 1975 to the Area Health Boards Act. During the late 1980s, WONAAC unsuccessfully lobbied several feminist MPs including Sonja Davies and the Minister of Women's Affairs Margaret Shields for a more liberal abortion law in the form of a private member's bill. However, the Fourth Labour Government thought there was insufficient support for further abortion reform and instead passed the Contraceptive, Sterilisation and Abortion Amendment Act 1990, which eliminated the restriction on who could educate and provide services and supplies. The‚Äìthen Health Minister and future Prime Minister Helen Clark sponsored the CS&A; Amendment Act. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, an anti-abortion group called Operation Rescue New Zealand was active, modeling itself after the American-based Randall Terry's Operation Rescue organisation. Operation Rescue used aggressive clinics including picketing abortion clinics, remonstrating with abortion patients, breaking into buildings and operation theatres to disrupt operations, and distributing leaflets attacking abortion practitioners as \\"baby killers.\\" Operation Rescue was also criticised for its aggressive tactics by the anti-abortion movement with Women for Live's president Anettta Moran rejecting the group's willingness to break the law. While SPUC's leadership was initially critical of Operation Rescue NZ, the leadership subsequently relented and allowed SPUC members to participate. Operation Rescue NZ had a large Catholic component including priests and clergy. According to McCulloch, an estimated half of Operation Rescue's supporters were also SPUC members. Operation Rescue's activities also attracted counter-protests from WONAAC and the Wellington-based group Choice. Into the 21st century =Attempts at abortion law reform, 1999‚Äì2001= In 1999, the Abortion Supervisory Committee's annual report criticised MPs for using it as a buffer between them and abortion interest groups, allowing them to abrogate their responsibilities. In response to that report, the newly‚Äìformed Fifth Labour Government, which was in coalition with the Alliance party, made attempts to reform New Zealand's abortion laws. After several months of preparatory work, the Cabinet agreed to amend the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Act 1977 in July 2001 to allow one doctor to approve an abortion. The Cabinet also submitted a Supplementary Order Paper exploring the grounds for abortion, possible decriminalisation, and the abolition of the Abortion Supervisory Committee. However, this plan was scuttled due to growing troubles within the Labour‚ÄìAlliance coalition government. =Introducing medical abortions, 2002‚Äì2003= Former ALRANZ president Margaret Sparrow established a non-profit company called Istar to import mifepristone (formerly known as RU 486), a pill used in medical abortions to cause the embryo to dislodge from the uterine wall, and a prostaglandin supplement to expel the remains. In 2002, Istar convinced the Abortion Supervisory Committee to seek a Court ruling on how the CS&A; Act 1977 applied to the use of mifepristone. In April 2003, Justice Durie ruled that women seeking medical abortions must take medications in a licensed facility but need not remain there between taking the two sets of tablets, which are taken 48 hours apart. Women also need not stay in the facility until the expulsion of the fetus completes the abortion. =2004 Parental notification amendment bill= In 2004, the Fifth Labour Government passed the Care of Child Act 2004 which allows a girl under the age of 16 to seek an abortion through the framework of the CS&A; Act 1977. That same year, National Party MP Judith Collins, with the support of anti-abortion lobby group Voice for Life (formerly SPUC), proposed an amendment to that law requiring anyone under 16 years of age to notify their parents before having an abortion. Collins was opposed by ALRANZ, the New Zealand Medical Association and New Zealand College of General Practitioners. A NZ Herald Digipoll showed that 71% of New Zealanders believed parents should be informed about whether or not their child was to have an abortion, with 60% believing this should be legally mandatory. This \\"parental notification\\" legislation was heavily defeated, as the New Zealand Medical Association and New Zealand College of General Practitioners objected that the abrogation of medical confidentiality would endanger pregnant incest survivors, and/or those within similar dysfunctional families and abusive parents. =2008 informed consent amendment bill= During the 48th New Zealand Parliament, former Kiwi Party list MP Gordon Copeland had a private members bill, the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion (Informed Consent) Amendment Bill, drawn from the ballot. It was based on an Australian Capital Territory 'informed consent' piece of legislation, since repealed, and was defeated on a voice vote in Parliament. Copeland has since been voted out of Parliament, as he did not secure a constituency seat at the New Zealand general election held in 2008 and his Kiwi Party polled well under the five percent threshold under the MMP framework in the Electoral Act 1993. =Chadwick's proposed amendment, 2010= In July 2010, Labour MP Steve Chadwick proposed an Abortion Reform Bill to take abortion out of the Crimes Act 1961. The anti-abortion organisation Voice for Life opposed the Bill while ALRANZ supported it. Due to fierce opposition from anti-abortion opponents and a lack of sufficient parliamentary support, Chadwick was unable to get the numbers to put her Bill into ballot. Even the progressive Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand declined to issue a public statement supporting Chadwick's bill. After Chadwick lost her seat in Parliament in the 2011 general election, she lamented the weakened state of the abortion rights movement in New Zealand and opined that change was only possible if the New Zealand Law Commission produced recommendations that any government would touch upon. =Challenges to abortion, 2009‚Äì2012= In 2009, the anti-abortion group Right to Life New Zealand launched a court case against the Abortion Supervisory Committee, accusing it of not sufficiently regulating abortion by allowing broad interpretation of the mental health exception. A High Court decision supported some of Right to Life New Zealand's points, finding that there was de facto abortion on demand. However, the Abortion Supervisory Committee appealed this to the New Zealand Court of Appeal. On 1 June 2011 the Court of Appeal overturned the earlier High Court verdict favoring Right to Life, finding that there was no statutory reference to embryos and fetuses within New Zealand law, and therefore no grounds for further attempted interference with existing abortion access procedures. It did not, however, overturn the finding that there was de facto abortion on demand in New Zealand. In March 2012, Right to Life appealed to the New Zealand Supreme Court, which dismissed their appeal by a 3‚Äì2 majority in August 2012. On 7 April 2011, during the term of the 49th New Zealand Parliament, MƒÅori Party co-leader Tariana Turia moved that an anti-abortion Pacific Island doctor, Ate Moala, be appointed to the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The vote was lost 70‚Äì30 against, with twenty absences or abstentions. That same year, anti-abortion groups successfully campaigned against an attempt by Family Planning New Zealand to introduce early medical abortions at one of its clinics. =Renewed abortion reform efforts, 2018= During the 2010s, a wave of international abortion reform law changes led to a renewed campaign by New Zealand abortion rights advocates to decriminalise abortion. ALRANZ and other abortion rights groups argued that abortion was a health and reproductive rights issue that should be removed from the Crimes Act. In 2018, ALRANZ and a group of women who had had abortions filed a case with the Human Rights Commission challenging the existing abortion legal framework in New Zealand. In late February 2018, the Minister of Justice Andrew Little sought advice from the New Zealand Law Commission on realigning the country's abortion legal framework towards a health approach. The Law Commission also received 3,419 public submissions on abortion law reform between 4 April and 18 May 2018. In late October 2018, the Law Commission proposed three options: having no statutory test to make sure the abortion was appropriate at any point; taking abortion off the Crimes Act but having a statutory test; or only having a test for later-term abortions, after 22 weeks. =2019‚Äì2020 abortion reform legislation= The Abortion Legislation Bill was introduced to Parliament in 2019 by Justice Minister Andrew Little. On 5 August 2019, the Justice Minister Andrew Little announced that the Government would be introducing new legislation giving women access to abortion for the first 20 weeks of pregnancy without having to navigate legal loopholes and removing abortion from the Crimes Act 1961. However Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said it is not a government bill. Other changes include allowing women to self-refer to an abortion service, ensuring that health practitioners advise women about counselling services, establishing safe areas around abortion facilities, and ensuring that conscientious objecting doctors inform women about their stance and alternative services. The Government adopted the Law Commission's third approach for a test on later-term abortions but reduced the time-frame to 20 weeks. The test for late term abortions is contained in section 11 of the proposed bill. Section 11 states that \\"a qualified health practitioner may provide abortion services to a woman who is more than 20 weeks pregnant only if the health practitioner reasonably believes that the abortion is appropriate in the circumstances...\\" The Down Syndrome advocacy group \\"Saving Downs\\" and disability advocates objected to Section 11 on the grounds that would facilitate the termination of babies with disabilities right through to birth. Both ALRANZ and Family Planning have welcomed the proposed changes but criticized the 20-week limit. By contrast, conservative lobby group Family First New Zealand criticized the Government's abortion law reform as \\"radical... and anti-human rights.\\" Labour and its coalition partner New Zealand First engaged in several months of negotiations discussing the legislation. The Minister for Children and New Zealand First MP Tracey Martin reportedly played an important part in these negotiations. Despite initially ruling out a referendum, NZ First leader Winston Peters subsequently demanded a binding referendum on abortion reform. In response, Opposition National MP Amy Adams criticized NZ First's U-turn, saying that the matter should be decided by Parliament. National Party leader Simon Bridges has indicated that he would support a Select Committee examining the bill. Voting for the new legislation will be done through a conscience vote. Justice Minister Little has ruled out NZ First's calls for holding a referendum on abortion reform. National Party leader Bridges has indicated he will vote against abortion reform but will allow National MPs to exercise a conscience vote. On 8 August, the Abortion Legislation Bill passed its first reading by 94‚Äì23 votes and was referred to select committee stage. By October 2019, the Abortion Legislation Committee had received 25,000 submissions from various legal and medical experts, religious groups, national organisations and ordinary people sharing personal experiences. Due to the large volume of submissions, the Committee only heard 150 oral submissions out of the 2,890 who had opted to speak. In mid-February 2020, the Abortion Legislation Committee recommended safeguards to address sex selection, late-term abortions, eliminate some barriers for women seeking abortions, and require a health professional approving abortion after 20 weeks to consult with another health professional including nurses and medical practitioners. In addition, Loheni published a minority report criticising the bill for what she regarded as a lack of safeguards on foetal abnormalities and late-term abortions. ACT New Zealand leader David Seymour supported the Select Committee's recommendations but argued that safe zones infringed on freedom of expression. While the New Zealand Medical Association welcomes these changes, Catholic bishops said that the legislation lacked safeguards for unborn babies with fetal disabilities. On 3 March 2020, the Bill passed its second reading by a narrower margin of 81‚Äì39 votes and was referred to a committee of the whole house. On 10 March, a Committee of the Whole House considered and rejected several amendments that included reducing penalties for safe zones, eliminating statutory tests for abortion up to birth, preventing gender- selective abortions, and requiring medical intervention of unintended live births. However, the committee passed two amendments including one by Labour MP Ruth Dyson dealing with conscientious objection and one by ACT Party MP David Seymour eliminating safe zones around abortion clinics. On 18 March, the Abortion Legislation Bill passed its third and final reading by a margin of 68 to 51. The bill's passage preceded a debate that same day where parliamentarians voted by 100‚Äì19 votes against holding a public referendum on abortion. Public opinion and activism In March 2019, 69.9% of respondents to a poll by Newshub supported the decriminalisation of abortion. Abortion rights groups and supporters Margaret Sparrow, President of ALRANZ (1975‚Äì1980, 1984‚Äì2011) The main abortion rights lobby group is Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand (ALRANZ), which favours the complete decriminalisation of abortion in New Zealand. During the 1990s and early 2000s, ALRANZ experienced a steep decline in membership, with ALRANZ's Christchurch and Hawke's Bay branches shutting down in 1996 and 2004. By 2011, ALRANZ's membership had dwindled to around 235 members. Contemporary abortion rights activism has focused on defending the status quo from anti-abortionists and lobbying for the legalisation of Mifepristone for use in medical abortions. Historical abortion rights lobby groups have included the more radical Women's National Abortion Action Campaign (WONAAC), the Auckland Anti- Hospitals Amendment Bill Committee, the May Abortion Action Committee, and the National Organisation for Women (NOW). Some professional bodies have also taken a pro-abortion rights position. New Zealand Family Planning (formerly the Family Planning Association) supports abortion laws that respect women's autonomy and human rights. The New Zealand Medical Association supports abortion reform including the removal of abortion from the Crimes Act 1961. The New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists (NZARH) has advocated the removal of abortion from the Crimes Act 1961, viewing it as a matter of reproductive rights. Amnesty International New Zealand has supported abortion law reform including the removal of abortion from the Crimes Act. Anti-abortion groups and supporters A roadside sign in the South Island advocating anti-abortion. The first major anti-abortion group in New Zealand was the Society for the Protection of the Unborn (SPUC), which was led by Marilyn Pryor. SPUC drew support from the Catholic Church in New Zealand and politicians from the two major parties, Labour and National. By 1975, SPUC had 28 branches and 40,000 members. Policy differences between the national leadership and the Christchurch branch led by Ken Orr led to SPUC's splintering in 2000. The Christchurch branch revamped itself as Right to Life New Zealand in September 2000 while the national organisation rebranded itself as Voice for Life in 2004. Other anti-abortion groups have included Family Life International, Family First New Zealand, the youth-based organisation ProLife NZ, Focus on the Family New Zealand. Some of these anti-abortion groups had international connections and also took an interest in other issues including euthanasia and in vitro fertilisation. These anti-abortion groups were often well-funded. According to McCulloch, Right to Life had an annual income of NZ$25,000 to NZ$35,000 a year during the mid‚Äìto‚Äìlate 2000s; spending NZ$80,000 on its legal challenge against the Abortion Supervisory Committee by May 2009. Some former anti-abortion groups have included Operation Rescue New Zealand, Women for Life, and the Kiwi Party. In 2013, McCulloch has estimated that the anti-abortion movement in New Zealand had tens of thousands of members. Anti-abortion activism have included picketing abortion clinics and hospitals, targeting doctors and members of the Abortion Supervisory Committee, public booths, newspaper advertisements, distributing informational material, lobbying politicians, letters to the editor, and protests. Operation Rescue NZ drew controversy for its aggressive methods which included invading abortion clinics and operating theatres and sending death threats to abortion practitioners. Anti-abortion groups have also pursued a \\"Stop Family Planning\\" campaign reminiscent of similar efforts in the United States against Planned Parenthood. In 2009, former Prolife New Zealand leader Andy Moore created a spoof website using the domain name \\"alranz.org.nz\\" which attacked Alranz. After \\"alranz.org.nz\\" was shut down by a successful complaint, Moore created a wiki called \\"AbortionWiki\\" which targeted ALRANZ and other abortion rights supporters. In addition, violent militant elements of the anti-abortion movement have also perpetrated arson attacks and bomb threats against abortion clinics. The Auckland Medical Aid Centre experienced several arson attacks in 1976 and 1989. Lyndhurst clinic in Christchurch experienced arson attacks in May 1985 and October 1989. In 1999 Graeme White was jailed for tunneling into Lyndhurst clinic in a failed attempt to blow it up. Epsom Day clinic experienced an arson attack in 1985, a firebombing in April 1987, and a bomb threat in October 1989. These violent attacks on clinics were disavowed by anti-abortion leaders including Marilyn Pryor and Auckland SPUC president John Carroll. Religious denominations and organisations =Christian= The Catholic Church in New Zealand has remained an opponent of abortion, teaching that life begins at conception. The Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand has expressed concerns that the Abortion Legislation Act 2020 does not protect unborn children and could lead to sex and disability-selective abortions. The New Zealand Christian Network takes the view that abortion should be \\"safe, legal and rare\\" and opposed Abortion Legislation Bill on the grounds that it does not protect unborn children and would facilitate abortion on demand. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) opposes elective abortions for personal and social convenience but permits abortion in cases of rape, incest, protecting the life and health of the mother, and fetal deformities. The LDS Church has not taken a stand on legislative proposals and public demonstrations regarding abortion. Political parties' positions ACT Party The libertarian ACT Party views abortion as a personal right for women. They also support reforming New Zealand's abortion laws. Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand supports decriminalising abortion, regarding it as a matter of female autonomy. All Green MPs voted in support of the Abortion Legislation Act 2020 Labour Party During New Zealand general election, 2017, the Labour Party's leader Jacinda Ardern said a Labour government would decriminalise abortion. Minister of Justice Andrew Little has also supported abortion reform, arguing that a woman should have the right to decide unless the pregnancy is more than 22 weeks. All Labour MPs voted in support of the Abortion Legislation Act 2020 except: Damien O'Connor, Greg O'Connor, Anahila Kanongata'a-Suisuiki, Nanaia Mahuta, Adrian Rurawhe, Jenny Salesa, Jamie Strange, Rino Tirikatene, Meka Whaitiri (9) National Party These MPs voted against the Bill: Kanwaljit Singh Bakshi, Maggie Barry, Andrew Bayly, Simon Bridges, Simeon Brown, Gerry Brownlee, Jacqui Dean, Sarah Dowie, Paulo Garcia, Paul Goldsmith, Nathan Guy, Joanne Hayes, Harete Hipango, Matt King, Denise Lee, Melissa Lee, Agnes Loheni, Tim Macindoe, Todd McClay, Ian McKelvie, Todd Muller, Alfred Ngaro, Simon O'Connor, Parmjeet Parmar, Christopher Penk, Maureen Pugh, Shane Reti, Alastair Scott, Nick Smith, Louise Upston, Tim van den Molen, Hamish Walker, Michael Woodhouse, Jonathan Young, Lawrence Yule (35) NZ First These MPs voted against the Bill: Darroch Ball, Shane Jones, Ron Mark, Clayton Mitchell, Mark Patterson, Winston Peters, Fletcher Tabuteau (7 MPs) New Conservative Party The New Conservative Party, which is currently not represented in the New Zealand Parliament, supports parental notification for adolescent abortions. Statistics Since 1978, the Abortion Supervisory Committee (ASC) has collected statistics on the numbers of terminations performed each year, and for what reason, under the terms of the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977. In 1983, Statistics New Zealand agreed to process abortion statistics on behalf of the ASC and subsequently took over responsibility for releasing abortion‚Äìrelated statistics in 1998. Since abortion was illegal until 1977, there are no exact figures on abortions prior to the 1970s. Megan Cook estimates that 10,000 abortions took place each year during the 1930s, based on statistics relating to the number of women admitted to hospital during that period for septic abortions. Historical figures During the 1970s and 1980s, the abortion rate per woman rose from 0.02 in 1971 to 0.30 by 1986. The number of unmarried women seeking abortions, including those in de facto relationships, also increased. During that period, women aged 24 and younger were more likely to seek abortions than older women. While European New Zealanders were more likely to have an abortion at a younger age to end an unwanted pregnancy, MƒÅori and Pacific New Zealanders were more likely to use abortion to mitigate failures of contraception. According to figures released by Statistics New Zealand, the number of abortions rose from 8.5 per 1,000 women aged 15‚Äì44 years in 1980 to 14 per 1,000 women in 1990. By 2000, this figure had risen to 18.7 per 1,000 women aged 15‚Äì44 years but has since declined to 13.5 per 1,000 women as of 2018. As the annual statistics for the Abortion Supervisory Committee have repeatedly said, mental health grounds are the predominant grounds for most certified abortions in New Zealand. The high numbers of abortions in New Zealand for mental health grounds have led anti-abortionists to express concerns that the mental health exception is being used to allow abortion on demand. By contrast, ALRANZ says that successive abortion-related case law has preserved the status quo of partial decriminalisation and liberal terms of abortion access for most New Zealand women who need an abortion. 2018 abortion statistics According to Statistics New Zealand, 13,282 induced abortions had been performed in New Zealand in 2018. There were 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15‚Äì44 years in 2018, down from 13.7 per 1,000 women in 2017. Split amongst ethnicity in 2018, the highest rates were among European women (7,567), followed by MƒÅori (2,979), Asian women (2,789), and Pacific women (1,354), and MELAA ( or Middle Eastern, Latin American, and African) (215). In 2017, New Zealand's abortion rate of 13.7 per 1000 women aged 15‚Äì44 years was similar to the United States (13.5), South Australia (13.2 in 2016). This is below England and Wales (17.0), France (17.2), and Sweden (19.8) but higher than Germany (7.1), Finland (9.6), Scotland (12.1), and Norway (12.5).

He was also a theater professor, painter, and United States Army captain. Early life and education Davis was born and raised in Aurora, Missouri.Biography at DonSDavis.com He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in theater and art from Southwest Missouri State College. He said that \\"during the Vietnam era\\" he \\"was with the 7th Infantry in Korea\\" and at another point was \\"a personnel and administration officer; I ran records branches.\\" He was a captain at Fort Leonard Wood by the time he left the U.S. Army, \\"and worked with General Officers, so I've been able to use that in Hammond and other characters.\\" In 1970 he received a Master's Degree in Theatre from the Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIU); his thesis was \\"Design and Construction of Stage Settings for Black Comedy and The Two Executioners\\". He taught for several years before returning to SIUC to complete a Ph.D. in Theatre; his dissertation was \\"The Evolution of Scenography in the Western Theater\\". He began working in the film industry in the 1980s, while teaching at the University of British Columbia. In 1987, he stopped teaching in order to pursue acting full-time. Career He got the role of the eloquently spoken Major Briggs, he said, when \\"I was living in Vancouver and doing local work. But because of my accent in the '80s I couldn't play a Canadian in commercials. So someone suggested that I get an agent in Seattle. I did and was able to get commercial work and acting jobs there. I had a good resume. So when they were casting the Twin Peaks pilot my agent sent me out to the audition. I met series creator David Lynch and didn't actually read for him ‚Äî we just visited. ... David liked me and started writing for me. He liked the chemistry I had with other players. I did three days on the pilot and then went on to the series. That was the luckiest break I could have had. There are at least a dozen people from that show who are lifelong friends because of that show. It was a life-changing experience.\\" In the TV show MacGyver, Davis was the stunt/photography double for Dana Elcar. He was often mistaken for Elcar, and vice versa. Davis did appear in two episodes of MacGyver, as a different character each time. His first appearance was as a cement truck driver in the episode \\"Blow Out\\", and his second appearance was as the poacher Wyatt Porter in \\"The Endangered\\". He also played Dana Scully's father in the series The X-Files. Canadian audiences may also be familiar with Davis thanks to his appearance in one of the famous Heritage Minutes, in which he played an arrogant American gold prospector who pulls a gun on Mountie Sam Steele. He also played the role of the Racine Belles' manager in the movie A League of Their Own. He also had a guest-starring role in the pilot episode of the comedy-drama television series Psych, playing the character of Mr. McCallum. He was a member of the main cast of Stargate SG-1 during the first seven seasons of that television series, portraying General Hammond, commander of Stargate Command (SGC). He appeared in a recurring role during Seasons 8 to 10, cutting back his commitment due to health problems. He also played the character in one episode of the Stargate spin-off series Stargate Atlantis. Later life and death Davis, who was living in Gibsons, British Columbia, Canada, died on June 29, 2008, of a heart attack. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean. The writers of Stargate Atlantis paid him homage by mentioning the death of his character George Hammond and naming a spaceship after him in the final episode of the show airing January 9, 2009. He was again honored in October 2009, with the appearance of the spaceship Hammond in the pilot episode of Stargate Universe. Coincidentally, in episode 16 of season 4 of SG-1, \\"2010\\" (an episode set in the future which originally aired in January 2001), it is stated that General Hammond had died of a heart attack prior to the episode's events. Personal life Davis married Ruby Fleming in 2003, by which time he had a son, Matt Davis, from a previous marriage. He was given a GMC Envoy as a gift from the producers of Stargate SG-1 which his son still drives to this day. He was also a visual artist, spending most of his free time painting or carving. Davis grew up painting, sculpting and drawing. He continued to pursue these crafts his entire life, supplementing his income with design commissions and art sales. On the DVD commentary track for Stargate SG-1 season 6 episode 17 (\\"Disclosure\\"), Davis said that he once had a job carving wooden cigar store Indians that were sold at Silver Dollar City.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators and Boston Braves. He managed the Browns from 1924 through 1926. Sisler played college baseball for the University of Michigan and was signed by the St. Louis Browns as a free agent in 1915. He won the American League batting title in 1920 and 1922. In 1920 he set the major league record for hits with 257 which stood for 84 years and had a batting average of .407 (the seventh highest after 1900). In 1922 he won the AL Most Valuable Player Award, he finished with a batting average of .420 which is the third highest batting average ever recorded after 1900. An attack of sinusitis in 1923 caused Sisler's play to decline, but he continued to play in the majors until 1930. After Sisler retired as a player, he worked as a major league scout and aide. A two time batting champion, Sisler led the league in hits twice, triples twice, and stolen bases four times. He collected 200 or more hits six times in his career, and had a batting average of over .300 a total of 13 times throughout his career. His career batting average of .340 is the 16th highest of all time. Sisler was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. Early life Sisler was born in the unincorporated hamlet of Manchester (now part of the city of New Franklin, a suburb of Akron), OhioDeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, p. 51. .. His paternal ancestors were immigrants from Northern Germany in the middle of the 19th century. Manchester did not have a high school and when it was time to start, Sisler moved to Akron to live with his older brother so that he could attend school there.Huhn, David, pp. 8 Sisler was an athletic student and played baseball, basketball and footballHuhn, David, pp. 9 in high school, but was more focused on baseball. In 1910, when Sisler was a high school senior, his brother Efbert died of tuberculosis,Huhn, David, pp. 11 but Sisler was able to move in with a local family and finish school.Lowenfish, Lee, pp. 53‚Äì55 In 1911, Sisler signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates to play minor league baseball in the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League, but he never played in the league or earned any moneyWarburton, Paul, pp. 68‚Äì79 and instead played college ball for the University of Michigan. As a freshman pitcher, Sisler struck out 20 batters in seven innings during a 1912 game.Cook, William, pp. 190 He lettered in baseball from 1913 to 1915. At Michigan he played for coach Branch Rickey while earning a degree in mechanical engineering. After he graduated from Michigan, Sisler sought legal advice from Rickey about the status of his contract with Pittsburgh. The three-time Vanity Fair All- American had become highly sought-after by major league scouts. Rickey talked to Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss about releasing Sisler from the contract he had signed as a minor, but Dreyfuss maintained his claim to Sisler. Rickey wrote to the National Commission, baseball's governing body, who ruled that the contract was illegal. Rickey, now managing the St. Louis Browns, signed Sisler to a contract worth $7,400 ().Huhn, David, pp. 46 Major league career On June 28, 1915, Sisler made his major league debut, entering as a pitcher in relief against the Chicago White Sox.Huhn, David, pp. 49 He pitched three scoreless innings and struck out two batters, while at the plate he collected his first major league hit. A few days later, on July 3, he pitched a complete game victory for his first major league start, in which he struck out nine batters but also walked nine. It was after this start that Rickey decided to transition Sisler to first base.Huhn, David, pp. 50 On August 29, Sisler defeated Walter Johnson in a complete game 2‚Äì1 victory.Huhn, David, pp. 54 In 1916 Sisler transitioned fully to first base and played the position for 141 games. His .305 batting average led the team, as did his hits (177), his 24 errors that year led the American League for first basemen. On August 11, 1917, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics, Sisler recorded three hits in four at bats. Over the next 26 games he would record at least one hit and bat .422 throughout his 26 game hit streak.Huhn, David, pp. 65 Sisler led the team in most offensive categories and his .353 batting average was second in the American League, behind Ty Cobb. The Selective Service Act of 1917 was passed in May of 1917, and with it, the draft was enacted in the offseason. Sisler's teammates Urban Shocker and Ken Williams were assigned Class 1 in the draft, placing them at the top of the draft eligibility list. Williams would play only two games in the 1918 season before being drafted. Sisler was listed as Class 4 much further down on the list. He then enlisted in the army, joining several major league players in a Chemical Warfare Service unit commanded by Rickey. In 1918 he played in only 114 games but was able to steal 45 bases, which led the league, and placed third in the American league with a .341 batting average. Sisler was preparing to go overseas when World War I ended that November.Huhn, David, pp. 73‚Äì74 1921 baseball card of Sisler In 1920, Sisler played every inning of each game. He stole 42 bases (second in the American League), collected a major league- leading 257 hits for an average of .407 and ended the season by hitting .442 in August and .448 in September. His batting average was the highest ever for a 600+ at-bat performance. In breaking Ty Cobb's 1911 record for hits in a single season, Sisler established a mark which stood until Ichiro Suzuki broke the record with 262 hits in 2004. (Suzuki, however, collected his hits over 161 games during the modern 162-game season as opposed to 154 in Sisler's era. Suzuki had 704 at bats to Sisler's 631.) Sisler finished second in the AL in doubles and triples, as well as second to Babe Ruth in RBIs and home runs. Jim Barrero of the Los Angeles Times asserts that Sisler's record was largely overshadowed by Ruth's 54 home runs that season. \\"Of course, Ruth's obliteration of the home run record drew all the attention from fans and newspapermen, while Sisler's mark was pushed to the side and perhaps left unappreciated during what was a golden age of pure hitters\\", Barrero wrote. As his popularity increased, Sisler drew comparisons to Cobb, Ruth and Tris Speaker. Sisler, however, was much more reserved than those three stars. Writer Floyd Bell described Sisler as \\"modest, almost to a point of bashfulness, as far from egotism as a blushing debutante... Shift the conversation to Sisler himself and he becomes a clam.\\"Huhn, David, pp. 114 In 1922, Sisler hit safely in 41 consecutive games, an American League record that stood until Joe DiMaggio broke it in 1941. His .420 batting average is the third-highest of the 20th century, surpassed only by Nap Lajoie's .426 in 1901 and Rogers Hornsby's .424 in 1924. Sisler also led the AL in hits (246), runs (134), stolen bases (51), and triples (18). He was chosen as the AL's Most Valuable Player that year, the first year an official league award was given, as the Browns finished second to the New York Yankees. Sisler's 1922 season is considered by many historians to be among the best individual all- around single-season performances in baseball history.Kennedy, Kostya (March 14, 2011). The Streak. Sports Illustrated Magazine, Volume 14, No.ll, p. 64. A severe attack of sinusitis caused him double vision in 1923, forcing him to miss the entire season. He defied some predictions by returning in 1924 with a batting average over .300. Sisler later said, \\"I planned to get back in uniform for 1924. I just had to meet a ball with a good swing again, and then run. The doctors all said I'd never play again, but when you're fighting for something that actually keeps you alive ‚Äì well, the human will is all you need.\\" Sisler never regained his previous level of play, though he continued to hit over .300 in six of his last seven seasons and led the AL in stolen bases for a fourth time in 1927. In 1928, the Browns sold Sisler's contract to the Washington Senators, who in turn sold the contract to the Boston Braves in May. After batting .340, .326, and .309 in his three years in Boston, he ended his major league career with the Braves in 1930, then played in the minor leagues. Sisler accumulated a .340 lifetime batting average over his 16 years in the majors and stole 375 bases during his career. He had 200+ hits in six seasons. He hit over .300 thirteen times, including two seasons in which he hit over .400; 1926 was the only full season in which Sisler's average was less than .300. He stole over 25 bases in every year from 1916 through 1922, peaking with 51 the last year and leading the league three times. Sisler holds team records (for the St. Louis Browns, and now the Orioles) for career batting average, triples, and stolen bases, as well as batting average, on- base percentage, hits, on-base plus slugging, and total bases in a season. In 1939, Sisler became one of the first entrants elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He also posted a career pitching record of 5‚Äì6 with a 2.35 earned run average in 24 career appearances. He defeated Walter Johnson twice in complete-game victories. Later life and legacy After his playing career, Sisler reunited with Rickey as a special assignment scout and front-office aide with the St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates. Sisler and Rickey worked with future Hall of Famer Duke Snider to teach the young Dodgers hitter to accurately judge the strike zone. Sisler was part of a scouting corps that Rickey assigned to look for black players, though the scouts thought they were looking for players to fill an all-black baseball team separate from MLB. Sisler evaluated Jackie Robinson as a potential star second baseman, but he was concerned about whether Robinson had enough arm strength to play shortstop. With the Pirates in 1961, Sisler had Roberto Clemente switch to a heavier bat. Clemente won the league batting title that season. Sisler's sons Dick and Dave were also major league players in the 1950s. Sisler was a Dodgers scout in 1950 when his son Dick hit a game-winning home run against Brooklyn to clinch the pennant for the Phillies and eliminate the second-place Dodgers. When asked after the pennant winning game how he felt when his son beat his current team, the Dodgers, George replied, \\"I felt awful and terrific at the same time.\\" A passage in The Old Man and the Sea refers to Dick Sisler's long home run drives. Another son, George Jr., served as a minor league executive and as the president of the International League. Sisler also spent some time as commissioner of the National Baseball Congress. He died in Richmond Heights, Missouri, in 1973, while still employed as a scout for the Pirates. In editors at The Sporting News ranked Sisler 33rd on their list of \\"Baseball's 100 Greatest Players\\". Outside of St. Louis' Busch Stadium, there is a statue honoring Sisler. He is also honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In October 2004, Ichiro Suzuki broke Sisler's 84 year old hit record, collecting his 258th hit off of Texas Rangers pitcher Ryan Drese. Sisler's daughter Frances (Sisler) Drochelman and other members of his family were in attendance when the record was broken. While in St. Louis for the 2009 All-Star game, Ichiro Suzuki visited Sisler's grave site.Ichiro Suzuki pays respects at George Sisler's gravesite ‚Äì ESPN Tarpon Springs, Florida honored George by naming the former spring training home of the St. Louis Browns \\"Sisler Field\\". The fields were later taken over by the local Little League teams, and are still in use.https://www.tarponspringslittleleague.com/news_article/show/602946?referrer_id=2278297 See also * Major League Baseball titles leaders * List of Major League Baseball hit records * List of Major League Baseball career batting average leaders * List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball batting champions * List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual stolen base leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball players with a .400 batting average in a season * List of Major League Baseball single-game hits leaders * List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle * List of Major League Baseball player-managers * List of baseball players who went directly to Major League Baseball * University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor References  External links , or Retrosheet * *The Deadball Era * Category:1893 births Category:1973 deaths Category:American people of German descent Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Major League Baseball player-managers Category:American League batting champions Category:American League stolen base champions Category:Boston Braves players Category:St. Louis Browns players Category:Washington Senators (1901‚Äì1960) players Category:St. Louis Browns managers Category:Boston Braves coaches Category:Pittsburgh Pirates coaches Category:Brooklyn Dodgers scouts Category:Pittsburgh Pirates scouts Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Rochester Red Wings players Category:Shreveport Sports players Category:Michigan Wolverines baseball players Category:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:Sportspeople from Akron, Ohio ","title":"George Sisler"},{"id":"645315","text":"Topology of a bus network A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common half-duplex link called a bus.

Service history In commercial service, 1902-1917 The ship was constructed in 1902 by J. Blumer & Co., Sunderland, England, as SS Burbo Bank for the Fenwick Shipping Co., Ltd., was acquired by Leonhardt & Blumberg of Hamburg, Germany shortly before the beginning of World War I, and was renamed SS Frieda Leonhardt. After the outbreak of hostilities, she took refuge in Jacksonville, Florida, and remained there until the United States entered the war against Germany in the spring of 1917. Seized by the United States, 1917 She was then seized by United States Customs officials and was turned over to the United States Shipping Board (USSB). Transferred to the Navy by an executive order dated 22 May 1917, the freighter was moved to Charleston, South Carolina, to be prepared in the navy yard there for naval service. Renamed Astoria (SP-2005), she completed conversion late in 1917 and was commissioned on 15 November 1917, Lt. Comdr. Warren F. Purdy, NNV, in command. US Navy service, 1917-1921 Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Astoria departed Charleston on 23 November for a voyage to Gulfport, Mississippi, and back; reentered Charleston on 19 December; and remained until the last day of the year when she got underway for Hampton Roads, Virginia. The ship loaded a cargo of Army supplies, put to sea on 26 January 1918, and reached the French coast early in February. On 15 February ‚Äî while anchored in port at Brest, France ‚Äî Astoria was rammed by the French ship SS La Drome and suffered damage which required several weeks of repairs before she could resume action. On 10 May, the ship was assigned duty as a coal carrier for the Army. In that capacity, she shuttled between Cardiff, Wales, and the French ports of Brest, Saint-Nazaire, and La Pallice for the remainder of the war and into 1919. After a stop at Queenstown, Ireland, between 2 and 22 February, she got underway for the United States and operated along the east coast until April 1919 when she began one more round-trip voyage to France. Upon her return, she resumed cargo-carrying operations out of Norfolk and continued that role through the end of 1919. She stood out of Norfolk, on 5 January 1920, and steamed through the Panama Canal to the west coast. During her ten months of operations with the Pacific Fleet, she was classified AK-8 on 17 July 1920. On 11 November, the ship headed back toward the east coast. Decommissioning, sale, and later career Astoria was decommissioned at Boston, Massachusetts, on 20 April 1921; and she was sold on 20 December 1921 to Mr. Richard T. Green of Chelsea, Massachusetts. Thereafter, the ship remained active in merchant service ‚Äî under the names Astoria and, later, Hartwelson ‚Äî for more than two decades. As Astoria, she ran aground in Grays Harbor, Washington, on 2 May 1927 and was abandoned by her crew, but she later was refloated, repaired, and returned to service. On 5 May 1943, as Hartwelson, she ran aground on Bantam Rock, Sheepscot Bar, Maine, and foundered.

He became one of the most influential theoretical population geneticists. He is remembered in genetics for his innovative use of diffusion equations to calculate the probability of fixation of beneficial, deleterious, or neutral alleles. Combining theoretical population genetics with molecular evolution data, he also developed the neutral theory of molecular evolution in which genetic drift is the main force changing allele frequencies. James F. Crow, himself a renowned population geneticist, considered Kimura to be one of the two greatest evolutionary geneticists, along with Gustave Mal√©cot, after the great trio of the modern synthesis, Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane and Sewall Wright. Life and work Kimura was born in Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture. From an early age he was very interested in botany, though he also excelled at mathematics (teaching himself geometry and other maths during a lengthy convalescence due to food poisoning). After entering a selective high school in Nagoya, Kimura focused on plant morphology and cytology; he worked in the laboratory of M. Kumazawa studying the chromosome structure of lilies. With Kumazawa, he also discovered how to connect his interests in botany and mathematics: biometry. Due to World War II, Kimura left high school early to enter Kyoto Imperial University in 1944. On the advice of the prominent geneticist Hitoshi Kihara, Kimura entered the botany program rather than cytology because the former, in the Faculty of Science rather than Agriculture, allowed him to avoid military duty. He joined Kihara's laboratory after the war, where he studied the introduction of foreign chromosomes into plants and learned the foundations of population genetics. In 1949, Kimura joined the National Institute of Genetics in Mishima, Shizuoka. In 1953 he published his first population genetics paper (which would eventually be very influential), describing a \\"stepping stone\\" model for population structure that could treat more complex patterns of immigration than Sewall Wright's earlier \\"island model\\". After meeting visiting American geneticist Duncan McDonald (part of Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission), Kimura arranged to enter graduate school at Iowa State College in summer 1953 to study with J. L. Lush. Kimura soon found Iowa State College too restricting; he moved to the University of Wisconsin to work on stochastic models with James F. Crow and join a strong intellectual community of like-minded geneticists, including Newton Morton and most significantly, Sewall Wright. Near the end of his graduate study, Kimura gave a paper at the 1955 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium; though few were able to understand it (both because of mathematical complexity and Kimura's English pronunciation) it received strong praise from Wright and later J.B.S. Haldane. His accomplishments at Wisconsin included a general model for genetic drift, which could accommodate multiple alleles, selection, migration, and mutations, as well as some work based on R.A. Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. He also built on the work of Wright with the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation by introducing the Kolmogorov backward equation to population genetics, allowing the calculation of the probability of a gene to become fixed in a population. He received his PhD in 1956, before returning to Japan (where he would remain for the rest of his life, at the National Institute of Genetics). Kimura worked on a wide spectrum of theoretical population genetics problems, many of them in collaboration with Takeo Maruyama. He introduced the \\"infinite alleles\\", \\"infinite sites\\", and \\"stepwise mutation\\" models for the study of genetic drift, both of which would be used widely as the field of molecular evolution grew alongside the number of available peptide and genetic sequences. He also created the \\"ladder model\\" that could be applied to electrophoresis studies where homologous proteins differ by whole units of charge. An early statement of his approach was published in 1960, in his An Introduction to Population Genetics.Kimura Motoo, Sh≈´dan Idengaku gairon, Baif≈´kan, Tokyo 1960 He also contributed an important review article on the ongoing controversy over genetic load in 1961. 1968 marked a turning point in Kimura's career. In that year he introduced the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the idea that, at the molecular level, the large majority of genetic change is neutral with respect to natural selection--making genetic drift a primary factor in evolution. The field of molecular biology was expanding rapidly, and there was growing tension between advocates of the expanding reductionist field and scientists in organismal biology, the traditional domain of evolution. The neutral theory was immediately controversial, receiving support from many molecular biologists and attracting opposition from many evolutionary biologists. Kimura spent the rest of his life developing and defending the neutral theory. As James Crow put it, \\"much of Kimura's early work turned out to be pre-adapted for use in the quantitative study of neutral evolution\\". As new experimental techniques and genetic knowledge became available, Kimura expanded the scope of the neutral theory and created mathematical methods for testing it against the available evidence. Kimura produced a monograph on the neutral theory in 1983, The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, and also worked to promote the theory through popular writings such as My Views on Evolution, a book that became a best-seller in Japan. Though difficult to test against alternative selection-centered hypotheses, the neutral theory has become part of modern approaches to molecular evolution. In 1992, Kimura received the Darwin Medal from the Royal Society, and the following year he was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Society. Kimura suffered from progressive weakening caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis later in life.

The island is part of the Murray Island Group in the Torres Strait. The town is on the island's northwest coast and within the locality of Mer Island (the locality boundaries are the island's coastline). The island is of volcanic origin, the most easterly inhabited island of the Torres Strait Islands archipelago, just north of the Great Barrier Reef. The name Meer/Mer/Maer comes from the native Meriam language. In the , Murray Island had a population of 453. The island is populated by the Melanesian Meriam people. There are eight tribes on Mer: Komet, Zagareb, Meuram, Magaram, Geuram, Peibri, Meriam-Samsep, Piadram/Dauer. The organisation of the island is based on the traditional laws of boundary and ownership. Geography Murray Island, in the eastern section of Torres Strait, is a basaltic island formed from an extinct volcano, last active over a million years ago. It formed when the Indo-Australian Plate slid over the East Australia hotspot. The island rises to a plateau above mean sea level. The island's highest point is the Gelam Paser, the western end of the volcano crater. The island has red fertile soil and is covered in dense vegetation. It has a tropical climate with a wet and dry season. The Murray Islands group comprises three islands: Murray Island (Mer), Dauan Island (Dauar) and Waier Island (Waua). History  Pre-European settlement  Map of Mer with traditional districts and villages. Murray Island has been inhabited for around 2800 years, the first settlers being Papuo-Austronesians who brought agriculture and pot making with them. Regular contact between the inhabitants of Torres Strait (including Murray Island, known by the Meriam people as Mer Island), Europeans, Asians and other outsiders began once the Torres Strait became a means of passage between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean in the 19th Century. A 1914 photograph of native inhabitants of Murray Island. The inhabitants of the Torres Strait, including the Meriam people, gained a reputation as fierce warriors and skilled mariners. Warfare (both intertribal and against European ships in transit through the Coral Sea) and head hunting were part of the culture of all Torres Strait islanders. The account of Jack Ireland, a surviving cabin boy from the barque Charles Eaton that was wrecked in 1834 at Detached Reef near the entrance to Torres Strait, is of interest in this respect. Ireland and another young survivor named William D'Oyley spent much of their time on the island before being rescued. In 1836 a large ceremonial mask was recovered from neighbouring Aureed (Skull) Island following the rescue of Ireland and D'Oyley and their return to Sydney. The mask was made of turtle shells surrounded by numerous skulls, seventeen of which were determined to have belonged to the crew and passengers of the Charles Eaton who were massacred when they came ashore following the shipwreck. The mask was entered into the collection of the Australian Museum after the skulls were buried on 17 November 1836 in a mass grave in the Sydney cemetery in Devonshire Street. A monument was erected in the form of a huge altar stone to record the manner by which they perished . When the Devonshire Street Cemetery was resumed for the site of the Central Railway Station in 1904 the skulls and the monument were removed to Bunnerong Cemetery at Botany Bay Sydney.  Post European settlement (1872)  Missionaries (mainly Polynesian) and some other Polynesians began to settle on the island in 1872 when the London Missionary Society founded a missionary school there. The Queensland Government annexed the islands in 1879. Tom Roberts, the well-known Australian painter, visited the island in 1892. He witnessed a night-time dance and depicted it in a painting. In 1936, a maritime strike fuelled by Islander dissatisfaction with the fact that their wages and boats were managed by the Protector of Aborigines allowed islanders to assert control and reject government controls. In 1937, the inaugural meeting of Island Councillors on Yorke Island resulted in the Torres Strait Islander Act 1939, giving Islanders more authority in their own affairs and established local governments on each island. Murray Island court house and people, 1898. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, over 700 Islanders volunteered to defend the Torres Strait. This group was organised into the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion. The migration of Islanders to mainland Australia increased as jobs disappeared in the pearling industry. A call for independence from Australia in the 1980s was due to the government failing to provide basic infrastructure on the island. Murray Island's most famous resident was trade unionist Eddie Mabo, whose decision to sue the Queensland Government to secure ownership of his land, which had been removed from his ancestors by the British colonial powers using the terra nullius legal concept, ultimately led to the High Court of Australia, on appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Queensland, issue the \\"Mabo decision\\" to finally recognise Mabo's native title rights on his land on 3 June 1992. This decision continues to have ramifications for Australia. Mabo himself died a few months before the decision. After vandalism to his grave site, he was reburied on Murray Island where the islanders performed a traditional ceremony for the burial of a king. In the Murray Island had a population of around 485. In the , Murray Island had a population of 453 people. Culture Flag of Murray Island The people of Mer maintain their traditional culture. Modern influences such as consumer goods, television, travel and radio are having an impact on traditional practices and culture. Despite this, song and dance remains an integral part of island life and is demonstrated through celebrations such as Mabo Day, Coming of the Light, Tombstone openings and other cultural events. In 2007, after two years of negotiations, the skulls of five Islander tribesmen were returned to Australia from a Glasgow museum where they had been archived for more than 100 years. The artist Ricardo Idagi was born on Murray Island. Idagi won the main prize at the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards in 2009. Language The people of Murray Island speak Torres Strait Creole and Meriam, a member of the Eastern Trans-Fly languages of Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea; its sister languages being Bini, Wipi and Gizrra. Though it is unrelated to Kalaw Lagaw Ya of the Central and Western Islands of Torres Strait, the two languages share around 40% of their vocabulary. Torres Strait English is a second language. Governance Murray Island is governed by the Community Council, which is responsible for roads, water, housing and community events. The Community Council is an integral part of community life. The elders of the community hold a position of respect and also have a major influence on island life. Queensland‚Äôs control was moved from just 3 miles, to a large 60 miles offshore. This brought all of Torres Strait that were within a couple hundred meters of New guineas coast, into Queensland. The laws rose from requests from the public, who were asking for the lease of islands Queensland‚Äôs coast. As before this, all islands that were within three miles of the coast, were under Queensland‚Äôs control. Murray island waited unclaimed until 1879. In 1879, Britain annexed the island to Queensland. The reason for annexation was to protect the British and their property, control the Torres Strait and sea lane to India, dominate fishing and pearling industries and to extend authority to some non-British areas. Britain also gave all control of Torres Strait islands to Queensland, with no negotiating treaties, in order to avert enemy colonial powers claiming the region.

In physics, it describes the macroscopic behavior of many micro-particles in Brownian motion, resulting from the random movements and collisions of the particles (see Fick's laws of diffusion). In mathematics, it is related to Markov processes, such as random walks, and applied in many other fields, such as materials science, information theory, and biophysics. The diffusion equation is a special case of convection‚Äìdiffusion equation, when bulk velocity is zero. Statement The equation is usually written as: where œï(r, t) is the density of the diffusing material at location r and time t and D(œï, r) is the collective diffusion coefficient for density œï at location r; and ‚àá represents the vector differential operator del. If the diffusion coefficient depends on the density then the equation is nonlinear, otherwise it is linear. The equation above applies when the diffusion coefficient is isotropic; in the case of anisotropic diffusion, D is a symmetric positive definite matrix, and the equation is written (for three dimensional diffusion) as: If D is constant, then the equation reduces to the following linear differential equation: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\\\partial t} = D abla^2\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{r},t), which is identical to the heat equation.  Historical origin  The particle diffusion equation was originally derived by Adolf Fick in 1855.  Derivation  The diffusion equation can be trivially derived from the continuity equation, which states that a change in density in any part of the system is due to inflow and outflow of material into and out of that part of the system. Effectively, no material is created or destroyed: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\phi}{\\\\partial t}+ abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{j}=0, where j is the flux of the diffusing material. The diffusion equation can be obtained easily from this when combined with the phenomenological Fick's first law, which states that the flux of the diffusing material in any part of the system is proportional to the local density gradient: :\\\\mathbf{j}=-D(\\\\phi,\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\, abla\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{r},t). If drift must be taken into account, the Smoluchowski equation provides an appropriate generalization. Discretization The diffusion equation is continuous in both space and time. One may discretize space, time, or both space and time, which arise in application. Discretizing time alone just corresponds to taking time slices of the continuous system, and no new phenomena arise. In discretizing space alone, the Green's function becomes the discrete Gaussian kernel, rather than the continuous Gaussian kernel. In discretizing both time and space, one obtains the random walk. Discretization (Image) The product rule is used to rewrite the anisotropic tensor diffusion equation, in standard discretization schemes, because direct discretization of the diffusion equation with only first order spatial central differences leads to checkerboard artifacts. The rewritten diffusion equation used in image filtering: denotes transpose, in which in image filtering D(œï, r) are symmetric matrices constructed from the eigenvectors of the image structure tensors. The spatial derivatives can then be approximated by two first order and a second order central finite differences. The resulting diffusion algorithm can be written as an image convolution with a varying kernel (stencil) of size 3 √ó 3 in 2D and 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 in 3D.

It is generally considered to be one of the most enduring classics of Canadian humorous literature. The fictional setting for these stories is Mariposa, a small town on the shore of Lake Wissanotti. Although drawn from his experiences in Orillia, Ontario, Leacock notes: \\"Mariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty of them. You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same square streets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels.\\" This work has remained popular for its universal appeal. Many of the characters, though modelled on townspeople of Orillia, are small town archetypes. Their shortcomings and weaknesses are presented in a humorous but affectionate way. Often, the narrator exaggerates the importance of the events in Mariposa compared to the rest of the world. For example, when there is a country-wide election, \\"the town of Mariposa, was, of course, the storm centre and focus point of the whole turmoil.\\" The story of the steamboat Mariposa Belle sinking in Lake Wissanotti is one of the best-loved in the set. The apparent magnitude of this accident is lessened somewhat when it is revealed that the depth of the water is less than six feet. Men from the town come to the rescue in an un-seaworthy lifeboat which sinks beneath them just as they are pulled onto the steamer, and the narrator earnestly remarks that this was \\"one of the smartest pieces of rescue work ever seen on the lake.\\" Selected list of characters Mr. Smith, as depicted in a 1912 version of the book. The following characters are interwoven through the set of twelve stories of Sunshine Sketches: *Josh Smith, proprietor of Smith's Hotel, one of the leading citizens of the town. *Jefferson Thorpe, owner of the barber shop, who engages in mining speculations. *Golgotha Gingham, the undertaker, to whom people are less interesting when still alive. *Dean Rupert Drone, reverend of the \\"Church of England Church,\\" who has to deal with the debt from building a new church. *Peter Pupkin, a bank teller who loves the Judge's daughter. *Zena Pepperleigh, Judge Pepperleigh's daughter. She likes to read romantic stories. *Dr. Gallagher, collector of Indian relics and student of Canadian history. *Mr Hussell, journalist for the Mariposa Newspacket. *Christie Johnson, captain of the Mariposa Belle. *Henry Mullins, manager of the Mariposa Exchange Bank. *Caleb Dueck, the owner of Caleb's general good, a mighty fine man. *Narrator, an unreliable narrator, whose descriptions of the town are biased or absurd. Many characters are based on real-life people from Orillia, Ontario. Their names were only thinly-veiled in the original sketches that appeared as a serial in the Montreal Star. Out of an abundance of caution, Leacock changed many characters' names before the sketches were published together in book form. Publication history What would become the book started as a sequence of short literary pieces serialized in the Montreal Daily Star from February 17, 1912 to June 22, 1912. Leacock reworked the series, by the means of additions, combinations, and divisions (but no deletions), before assembling them as the story we now know. The book was first published on August 9, 1912. Leacock corrected proof pages of the first edition of Sunshine Sketches while in Paris. Critical reception In 1923, George Locke commented in the New York Evening Post that library students had chosen the book as one of a dozen \\"[...] books of prose fiction would best represent the works of Canadian authors to readers who wish to know something of Canadian life\\". The book, along with the Champlain statue in Couchiching Beach Park on Lake Couchiching, were used in tourist promotions for the town as proof of Orillia's civic pride in the decades following the 1925 Dominion Day celebrations. Television adaptation (1952) In 1952, the book was adapted into a television series, Sunshine Sketches, by CBC Television, the network's first foray into Canadian-produced drama. The cast of the series included John Drainie as the Narrator, Paul Kligman as John Smith, Timothy Findley as Peter Pupkin, Eric House as Dean Drone, Peg Dixon as Liliane Drone and Robert Christie as Golgotha Gingham. Television adaptation (2012 TV movie) A second television adaptation, also on CBC, premiered in 2012. It stars Gordon Pinsent and Jill Hennessy. Two of Leacock stories in Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town were featured on the made-for-TV movie, created to coincide with the 100-year anniversary of the publication of Leacock's classic work. The two of Leacock's twelve sketches were \\"The Marine Excursions of the Knights of Pythias\\" and \\"The Hostelry of Mr. Smith.\\" The stories are a mix of fact and fiction; drawing on details of Leacock's own life and that of his literary creation.CBC Radio Canada.

The Chinese name for this species translates as \\"white sea-horse's nest\\". A. argo was the first argonaut species to be described and is consequently the type species of the genus. The type specimen of A. argo was collected in the Mediterranean Sea and is deposited at the Linnean Society of London.Current Classification of Recent Cephalopoda Description A. argo is the largest species in the genus and also produces the largest eggcase. Live animals have a characteristic blue sheen on the first arm pair and around the eyes. The eggcase is characterised by two rows of small, sharp tubercles running along a narrow keel, smooth ribs across the walls of the shell, and a thickening along the shell aperture, which forms distinct protrusions or 'horns' on either side. Argonauta cygnus Monterosato, 1889 was described based on a shell which lacked these protrusions, although it is now considered a junior synonym of A. argo. The greatest recorded size of an A. argo eggcase is 300 mm. Nesis, K. N. (1982). Abridged key to the cephalopod mollusks of the world's ocean. Light and Food Industry Publishing House, Moscow, 385+ii pp. [Translated into English by B. S. Levitov, ed. by L. A. Burgess (1987), Cephalopods of the world. T. F. H. Publications, Neptune City, NJ, 351 pp.] A damaged beak of a female A. argo (ML = 40.0 mm; caught at ), measuring 4.3 mm in hood length and 7.8 mm in crest length, is mentioned in A Handbook for the Identification of Cephalopod Beaks. Distribution and habitat A. argo is cosmopolitan, occurring in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. A dwarf form exists in the Mediterranean Sea, which was described as Argonauta argo mediterranea Monterosato, 1914, although this taxon is now regarded as invalid. Biology The female of the species, like all argonauts, creates a paper-thin eggcase that coils around the octopus much like the way a nautilus lives in its shell, hence the name paper nautilus. A. argo is thought to feed primarily on pelagic molluscs. The species is preyed on by numerous predators. It has been reported in the stomach contents of Alepisaurus ferox from the south-western Pacific. Female with damaged eggcase and eggs Males of this species reach sexual maturity at a mantle length (ML) of 8 mm. Females mature at about double the size of Argonauta bottgeri and Argonauta hians. They begin to secrete an eggcase at 6.5‚Äì7.0 mm ML. Eggs are usually laid when females reach 14‚Äì15 mm ML, although the size at which this takes place differs across the animal's range. A small A. argo residing in an 88 mm long eggcase was estimated to be carrying 48,800 embryos. Females grow to 100 mm ML, while males do not exceed 20 mm ML. In the open ocean, A. argo has been observed attached to jellyfish. This behaviour has been known for a long time, although little was understood about the relationship prior to the work of Heeger et al. in 1992. In \\"Predation on jellyfish by the cephalopod Argonauta argo\\", Heeger et al. describe their observations of a female A. argo found atop a host jellyfish. The argonaut was seen holding on to the aboral (exumbrellar) surface of the jellyfish using its lateral and ventral arms. The authors found that about half of the animal's aboral surface was damaged and large pieces of mesoglea were missing, presumably removed by the argonaut. Additionally, two holes, apparently bite marks, were found in the center of this area with channels leading from these holes into the gastral cavity of the jellyfish. The argonaut presumably used these channels to suck food particles from the gastral cavity. Heeger et al. suggested that \\"the association provided shelter or camouflage for the argonaut\\". Observations of captive A. argo females suggest that the expanded webs of the dorsal arms may aid the animal in feeding. Mark Norman mentions, \\"when food was touched against the spread webs, an arm shot out of the shell in a sweeping action, grabbing the prey\\". Argonauts are not thought to actively hunt, but employ this method to catch animals that bump into them in the open ocean. A. argo is occasionally involved in mass strandings along the South African and southern Australian coastlines. The strandings are seasonal and generally occur between April and August, towards the end of the animals' spawning season. Culture The symbol of Aoi leaf made of two argonaut shells.

Its realm was conquered by the Almohad Empire. The Hammadid dynasty's first capital was at Qalaat Beni Hammad. It was founded in 1007, and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. When the area was sacked by the Banu Hilal tribe, the Hammadids moved their capital to B√©ja√Øa in 1090. History In 987 and 989, al-Mansur ibn Buluggin, the emir of the Berber Zirid dynasty, appointed his uncle Hammad ibn Buluggin as governor of Ashir and western Zirid lands. Hammad subsequently defended the territory against Zenata incursions and was granted additional lands by al-Mansur's successor Badis ibn Mansur. In 1007 and 1008, forces under Hammad left Ashir and built a new citadel-capital, Qalaat Beni Hammad (also called Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad), in M'Sila Province in the Hodna Mountains; a thriving city sprung up around the fortress.Jeff Huebner, \\"Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad (M'sila, Algeria)\\" in Middle East and Africa: International Dictionary of Historic Places (Vol. 4) (eds. K.A. Berney, Trudy Ring & Noelle Watson: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1996), pp. 36-39. In 1014, Hammad declared his independence from Zirid suzerainty and switched his spiritual allegiance from the Shi'a Fatimid caliphs to the Sunni Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad. The Zirids failed to quash the rebellion and recognized Hammadid legitimacy in 1017, in a peace with al-Mu'izz, that was sealed by Hammad's son and successor, Qaid ibn Hammad. Al-Mu'izz subsequently also broke with the Fatimid and changed his allegiance to the Abbasids; the Fatimids under al- Mustansir, along with their fierce Bedouin Arab allies, the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, subsequently launched a massive and devastating campaign in present-day Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria, culminating in al-Mu'izz's defeat in 1053 and the subsequent reduction of Zirids to a small, insignificant territory based in Mahdia. Amidst the chaos, the Hammadids reverted their allegiance to the Fatimids and managed to negotiate an alliance with the Bedouin tribes. Although the Hammadids and Zirids entered into an agreement in 1077 in which Zirid ruler Tamim's daughter married into the Hammadids, this did not end the rivalry between the dynasties.Amar S. Baadj, Saladin, the Almohads and the Ban≈´ GhƒÅniya: The Contest for North Africa (12th and 13th centuries) (Brill: 2013), p. 45. A common pattern was for Hammadids and Zirids to support \\"rival coalitions of Arab tribes to fight their proxy wars.\\"Amar S. Baadj, Saladin, the Almohads and the Ban≈´ GhƒÅniya: The Contest for North Africa (12th and 13th centuries) (Brill: 2013), p. 34, footnote 20. The Hammidid-Zirid rivalry also influenced the choice of which caliph to recognize; historian Amar S. Baadj writes, \\"It would appear that the principle which the Hammadids followed in the course of their relations with Baghdad and Cairo was that of opposing the Zirids. Whenever the Zirids recognized one of two rival caliphs, the Hammadids would declare their submission to the other.Amar S. Baadj, Saladin, the Almohads and the Ban≈´ GhƒÅniya: The Contest for North Africa (12th and 13th centuries) (Brill: 2013), p. 46. Buluggin ibn Muhammad, a subsequent Hammadid ruler, invaded Morocco and briefly took Fez, but was forced to retreat against the Almoravid forces of Yusuf ibn Tashfin. Almoravid conquests between 1062 and 1082 extended their lands across Morocco and western Algeria. al-Nasir ibn Alnas assassinated his paternal cousin Buluggin and became the new emir.Amar S. Baadj, Saladin, the Almohads and the Ban≈´ GhƒÅniya: The Contest for North Africa (12th and 13th centuries) (Brill: 2013), pp. 42-47. The Hammadid empire peaked during al-Nasir's reign. The early parts of his reign (c. 1067-1072) was marked by the development of B√©ja√Øa (formerly Bougie) from a small fishing village into a larger, fortified town. Renamed al-Nasiriya in honor the emir, Bougie developed into a sophisticated trading city; under al-Nasir and his son and successor al-Mansur ibn Nasir, large gardens, palaces, a Great Mosque, and other landmarks were constructed in the town. In the 11th century, the Hammadids came under increasing pressure from the Banu Hilal, who had settled in the Plains of Constantine and increasingly threatened Qalaat Beni Hammad. While initially allied to the Bedouins, the Hammadids later became their puppets, allocating half of their harvest yields to them and buying off tribemen in order to secure the safety of trade routes. Over time, Qalaat Beni Hammad was eventually eclipsed by Bougie. In 1090, with the Banu Hilal menace rising, the Hammadids moved their capital to Bougie, yielding their southern territories to the Hilalians. The Hammadids maintained control of a small but prosperous coastal territory between T√©n√®s and La Calle (now El Kala). E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam (1927) states that the Qalaat Beni Hammad \\"was not completely abandoned by al-Mansur and he even embellished it with a number of palaces. The Hammadid kingdom had therefore at this point two capitals joined by a royal road.\\"Georges Marcais, \\"Al-Mansur, the sixth ruler of the Hammadid dynasty\\" in E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, Vol. 5 (ed. M. Th. Houtsma et al.) (Brill 1927: reprint ed. 1993), p. 250. During the reign of al-Mansur's son Abd al-Aziz ibn Mansur, Bougie had about 100,000 people, and the Hammadids consolidated their power in the city. The dynasty suffered a decline after this point; efforts to develop more sea power in the Mediterranean Sea were foiled by the Normans, who by the 12th century had conquered Sicily and had also occupied a number of settlements on the coast of Tunisia and Algeria. However, Abd al-Aziz did expel the Hilalians from Hodna and capture Jerba. The last dynastic emir was Yahya ibn Abd al-Aziz. Yahya repulsed Bedouin incursions and subdued uprisings by Berber clans, but during his reign the Genoese also raided Bougie (1136) and the Kingdom of Sicily occupied the settlement of Djidjelli and destroyed a pleasure palace that had been built there. In 1144 and 1145, Yahya dispatched Hammadid forces to join the Almoravids in fighting the Berber Almohads, led by Almohad Caliph Abd al- Mu'min. In 1151-52, Abd al-Mu'min conquered Tlemcen and Oran (1152) and marched against the Hammadids. The Almohads took Algiers (1152) and then captured Bougie later the same year, crushing Hammadids forces at the gates of the city. This marked a major military triumph for Abd al-Mu'min.Heather J. Empey, \\"The Mothers of the Caliph's Sons: Women as Spoils of War During the Early Almohad Period\\" in Concubines and Courtesans: Women and Slavery in Islamic History (eds. Matthew S. Gordon & Kathryn A. Hain: Oxford University Press, 2017), p. 151. Yahya fled to Constantine but surrendered several months later. He died in comfortable exile in Sal√©, Morocco, in 1163. Abd al-Mu'min enslaved the women and children of Hammadid loyalists who had fought against him, but did not sack Bougie because the city had willingly surrendered. Some 30 years after the collapse of the Hammadids, the dynasty had a brief revival in 1184, when 'Ali ibn Ghaniya--a member of the Banu Ghaniya branch of the Almoravid dynasty, which had established a corsair kingdom in the Balearic Islands--seized control of Bougie, recruited a mixed force of \\"dispossessed Hammadids, Sanhajahh Berbers, and Hilalian tribes\\" opposed to Almohad rule, and quickly captured Algiers, Miliana, Ashir, and al Qal'a, with the goal of establishing a new Almoravid polity in the Maghreb. Less than a year later, the Almohad had recaptured all the towns. The Banu Ghaniya did retain, through the end of the Almohad period, some influence in Tripolitania, southern Tunisia, and the Algerian plains, where Hammadid loyalists were numbered along their allies. Art and architecture Luster-painted and glazed ceramic decoration in a wide variety of shapes and forms were a feature in the Islamic architecture of Hammadid-era Bougie.Richard Ettinghausen, Oleg Grabar & Marilyn Jenkins, Islamic Art and Architecture 650-1250 (2d ed.: Yale University Press, 2001), pp. 276-77, 283. Al-Nasir reputedly negotiated with Pope Gregory VII for the services of Italian masons and other skilled craftsmen for the construction of Bougie. Although Bougie is mostly in ruins, a large sea gate reportedly survives.\\"Algeria\\" in Andrew Petersen, Dictionary of Islamic Architecture (Routledge, 1996), p. 13. In Qalaat Beni Hammad, the minaret, in height, is the only remaining part of the ruined Great Mosque; the structure bears some resemblance to Seville's Giralda. Architecture in Qalaat Beni Hammad featured adornments of \\"porcelain mosaics of many-colored faience, sculpted panels and plaster, enameled terra-cotta stalactites; building and pottery ornamentation consisted of geometric designs and stylized floral motifs.\\" Hammadid emirs constructed five palaces, most of which are now destroyed. The keep of the Palace of the Fanal (Qasr al-Manar) does survive.

He traveled throughout China for more than 30 years, documenting his travels extensively. The records of his travels were compiled posthumously in The Travel Diaries Xu Xiake, and his work translated by Ding Wenjiang.Needham, Volume 3, 524. Xu's writing falls under the old Chinese literary category of 'travel record literature' ('youji wenxue'‚ÄúÈÅäË®òÊñáÂ≠∏‚Äù), which used narrative and prose styles of writing to portray one's travel experiences.Hargett, 67‚Äì69. The People's Liberation Army Navy barracks ship Xu Xiake was named after him.  Life  With ancestors from Jiangxi province, Xu Xiake was born in what is today Jiangyin (in Jiangsu province) as Xu Hongzu (), as the second son of Xu Yu'an (ÂæêË±´Â∫µ, 1545‚Äì1694) and Wang Ruren (ÁéãÂ≠∫‰∫∫, 1545‚Äì1625). It was often said his mother encouraged him to travel and this shaped Xu's predilections. His sobriquet is Zhenzhi (). Xiake was an alternate sobriquet () given to him by his friend Chen Jiru (Èô≥ÁπºÂÑí, 1558‚Äì1639) and it means \\"one who is in the sunset clouds\\". His other friend, Huang Daozhou (ÈªÉÈÅìÂë®, 1585‚Äì1646), also gave Xu an alternate sobriquet: Xiayi (), meaning \\"untrammelled in the sunset clouds.\\" On his journeys throughout China he travelled with a servant called Gu Xing (). He faced many hardships along the way, as he was often dependent on the patronage of local scholars who would help him after he had been robbed of all his belongings. Local Buddhist abbots of the various places he visited often would pay him money as well, for the small service of recording the history of their local monastery. From the snowy passes of Sichuan, to the subtropical jungles of Guangxi and Yunnan, to the mountains of Tibet, Xu Xiake wrote of all his experiences and provided enormous amounts of written detail from his observations. Travel records Travel routes of Xu Xiake The written work of Xu Xiake's travel records and diaries contained some 404,000 Chinese characters, an enormous work for a single author of his time.Hargett, 69. Xu traveled throughout the provinces of China, often on foot, to write his enormous geographical and topographical treatise, documenting various details of his travels, such as the locations of small gorges, or mineral beds such as mica schists. Xu's work was quite systematic, providing accurate details of measurement, and his work, later translated into modern Chinese by Ding Wenjiang, reads more like the accounts of a 20th-century field surveyor than an early 17th-century scholar. In Guizhou, he made the discovery of the true source of the West River. He also discovered the Mekong and Salween rivers were, in fact, separate drainages with completely separate watersheds.Needham, Volume 3, p. 524-525. Xu made the important realization that the Jinsha river network and not the Min or Yalong formed the true headwaters of the Yangtze River, correcting a mistake in Chinese geography as old as the \\"Tribute of Yu\\" compiled by Confucius in the Classic of History.

Ezekiel's Wheel Ezekiel's encounter with the Merkabah and the Living Creatures The living creatures, living beings, or hayyoth (Hebrew ◊ó÷∑◊ô÷º◊ï÷π◊™ chayot) are a class of heavenly beings in Jewish mythology. They are described in the prophet Ezekiel's vision of the heavenly chariot in the first and tenth chapters of the Book of Ezekiel. References to the creatures recur in texts of Second Temple Judaism, in rabbinical merkabah (\\"chariot\\") literature, in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, and in the Zohar. According to Jewish and Christian traditions, there are four living creatures, although their description varies by source. The symbolic depiction of the four living creatures in religious art, especially Christian art, is called a tetramorph. Ezekiel's four living creatures Ezekiel's vision of the four living creatures in are identified as cherubim in who are God's throne bearers. Cherubim as minor guardian deities of temple or palace thresholds are known all over the Ancient East. Each of Ezekiel's cherubim have four faces, that of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. However, their human shape appearances set them apart from the griffin-like cherubs and lamassu of Babylonia and Assyria. In their ability to move, Ezekiel's cherubim do not need to turn, since they face all compass points simultaneously. This description of movement differs from the seraphim in Isaiah's vision () who have an extra set of wings for their ability to fly. Revelation's four living beings In , four living beings (Greek: Œ∂·ø∑ŒøŒΩ, z≈çion) are seen in John's vision. These appear as a lion, an ox, a man, and an eagle, much as in Ezekiel but in a different order. They have six wings, whereas Ezekiel's four living creatures are described as only having four. In verse 6, they are said to have \\"eyes all over, front and back\\", suggesting that they are alert and knowledgeable, that nothing escapes their notice. The description parallels the wheels that are beside the living creatures in Ezekiel 1.18; 10.12, which are said to be \\"full of eyes all around\\". The Hebrew word for \\"wheel\\" (√¥pann√Æm) was also used in later Jewish literature to indicate a member of the angelic orders (1 Enoch 71.7; 3 Enoch 1.8; 7.1; 25.5-6, etc.). In this passage in Revelation, the four beasts surround \\"the one\\" on the red throne (which is of ruby and sardius), which is contrasted with the white throne in and . Comparing the living creatures in Ezekiel with Revelation's is a prominent apocalyptic study in Western Christianity. An example is the 18th Century works of Jonathan Edwards' recorded interpretation of 1722/23. The four living creatures that John of Patmos sees in the Book of Revelation, is the author's reworking of the living creatures in the visions of Ezekiel () and Isaiah (). William D. Mounce noted a belief that the living creatures may have been associated with the four principal (or fixed) signs of the zodiac (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius), but other scholars have doubted this interpretation. In a critical analysis of John's vision, April De Conick's 2006 essay outlines that the hayyot in Ezekiel are perhaps not original with the author of Revelation. De Conick suggests that John may have drawn from other merkabah-related texts and by subtly working with images already known to his audience, he reshaped them for his own purposes. With John blending and transforming the images of his sources, it has given way to different interpretations. Religious views In Judaism, the living beings are considered angels of fire, who hold up the throne of God. According to the Zohar, they hold up the firmament itself.Noach 261‚Äì265, Zohar. They are ranked first in Maimonides' Jewish angelic hierarchy. In Christianity, the four living creatures are Cherubim. A prominent early interpretation, variously modified by different interpreters, has been to equate the four creatures with the Four Evangelists. Throughout church history, the most common interpretation (first laid out by Victorinus), but not the original or the only, is that the lion represents Mark, the calf Luke, the man Matthew, and the eagle John. Irenaeus was the first to make the association with the evangelists, but the interpretation laid out by Victorinus and adopted by Jerome, Gregory the Great, and the Book of Kells became dominant. Its influence has been on art and sculpture and is still prevalent in Catholicism and Anglicanism. A view held by many modern commentators is that the four living creatures of Revelation are agents of God and heavenly representatives of the created order, who call every living thing to worship the Creator. The four living creatures are identified by some scholars as hybrids (see human-animal hybrids).James L. Resseguie, \\"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,\\" in Religions, 10 (3) 217), 5-6. On this interpretation, the creatures merge traits of the world above (six wings; eyes in front and behind and around and inside) with character traits from this world (lion, ox, human, eagle). They represent the world above and this world in complete harmony with its Creator. By contrast, the locusts from the abyss (cf. Rev. 9:3-11) combine traits of the world below with this world and represent the creation in rebellion from its Creator.

The main corpus of the Merkabah literature was composed in the period 200‚Äì700 CE, although later references to the Chariot tradition can also be found in the literature of the Chassidei Ashkenaz in the Middle Ages.From Apocalypticism to Merkabah Mysticism: Studies in the Slavonic, p. 224, Andrei A.

The word \\"chariot\\" is found 44 times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible‚Äîmost of them referring to normal chariots on earth, and although the concept of the Merkabah is associated with Ezekiel's vision (1:4‚Äì26), the word is not explicitly written in Ezekiel 1. (JPS Hebrew/English) However, when left untranslated, in English the Hebrew term merkabah/merkavah (, , and ) relates to the throne-chariot of God in prophetic visions. It is most closely associated with the vision in Ezekiel chapter 1 of the four-wheeled vehicle driven by four hayyot (\\"living creatures\\"), each of which has four wingsSix wings in Isaiah's and John's visions ( and ) and the four faces of a man, lion, ox, and eagle (or vulture). Ezekiel's vision of the chariot Ezekiel's Wheel in St. John the Baptist Church in Kratovo, North Macedonia. Fresco from the 19th century. According to the verses in Ezekiel and its attendant commentaries, his vision consists of a chariot made of many heavenly beings driven by the \\"Likeness of a Man\\". The base structure of the chariot is composed of four beings. These beings are called the \\"living creatures\\" (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ô◊ï◊™ hayyot or khayyot). The bodies of the creatures are \\"like that of a human being\\", but each of them has four faces, corresponding to the four directions the chariot can go (East, South, North and West). The faces are that of a man, a lion, an ox (later changed to a cherub in Ezekiel ) and an eagle. Since there are four angels and each has four faces, there are a total of sixteen faces. Each of the hayyot angels also has four wings. Two of these wings spread across the length of the chariot and connect with the wings of the angel on the other side. This creates a sort of 'box' of wings that forms the perimeter of the chariot. With the remaining two wings, each angel covers its own body. Below, but not attached to, the feet of the hayyot angels are other angels that are shaped like wheels. These wheel angels, which are described as \\"a wheel inside of a wheel\\", are called \\"ophanim\\" ◊ê◊ï◊§◊†◊ô◊ù (lit. wheels, cycles or ways). These wheels are not directly under the chariot but are nearby and along its perimeter. The angel with the face of the man is always on the east side and looks up at the \\"Likeness of a Man\\" that drives the chariot. The \\"Likeness of a Man\\" sits on a throne made of sapphire. The Bible later makes mention of a third type of angel found in the Merkabah called \\"seraphim\\" (lit. \\"burning\\") angels. These angels appear like flashes of fire continuously ascending and descending. These seraphim angels power the movement of the chariot. In the hierarchy of these angels, seraphim are the highest, that is, closest to God, followed by the hayyot, which are followed by the ophanim. The chariot is in a constant state of motion, and the energy behind this movement runs according to this hierarchy. The movement of the ophanim is controlled by the \\"Living creatures\\", or Hayyot, while the movement of the hayyot is controlled by the seraphim. The movement of all the angels of the chariot is controlled by the \\"Likeness of a Man\\" on the Throne. Early Jewish merkabah mysticism Mark Verman has distinguished four periods in early Jewish mysticism, developing from Isaiah's and Ezekiel's visions of the Throne/Chariot, to later extant merkabah mysticism texts:Verman, The Books of Contemplation, p. 8; summarised by Sanford L. Drob in Kabbalistic Metaphors: Jewish Mystical Themes in Ancient and Modern Thought, Jason Aronson (2000) section of chapter 1, pp. 4‚Äì8 # 800‚Äì500 BCE, mystical elements in Prophetic Judaism such as Ezekiel's chariot # Beginning c. 530s BCE, especially 300‚Äì100 BCE, Apocalyptic literature mysticism # Beginning c. 100 BCE, especially 1‚Äì130s CE, early Rabbinic merkabah mysticism referred to briefly in exoteric Rabbinic literature such as the Pardes ascent; also related to early Christian mysticism # c. 1‚Äì200 CE, continuing till c. 1000 CE, merkabah mystical ascent accounts in the esoteric Merkabah-Hekhalot literature Rabbinic commentary Tomb of Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakai in Tiberias The earliest Rabbinic merkabah commentaries were exegetical expositions of the prophetic visions of God in the heavens, and the divine retinue of angels, hosts, and heavenly creatures surrounding God. The earliest evidence suggests that merkabah homiletics did not give rise to ascent experiences‚Äîas one rabbinic sage states: \\"Many have expounded upon the merkabah without ever seeing it.\\"Tosefta Megillah 3 [4]:28. One mention of the merkabah in the Talmud notes the importance of the passage: \\"A great issue‚Äîthe account of the merkavah; a small issue‚Äîthe discussions of Abaye and Rava [famous Talmudic sages].\\"See Idel, Moshe, , citing Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 28a. The sages Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zakkai (d. c. 80 CE) and later, Rabbi Akiva (d. 135) were deeply involved in merkabah exegesis. Rabbi Akiva and his contemporary Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha are most often the protagonists of later merkabah ascent literature. Prohibition against study Talmud on the Knesset Menorah. References in rabbinic Talmud and Midrash to merkabah mysticism are brief, avoiding explanation. The Talmudic interdictions concerning merkabah speculation are numerous and widely held. Discussions concerning the merkabah were limited to only the most worthy sages, and admonitory legends are preserved about the dangers of overzealous speculation concerning the merkabah. For example, the secret doctrines might not be discussed in public: \\"Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength. But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence; for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret.\\"Sirach (iii. 21‚Äì22) It must be studied only by exemplary scholars: \\"Ma'aseh Bereshit must not be explained before two, nor Ma'aseh Merkabah before one, unless he be wise and understands it by himself.\\"Hagigah ii. 1 Further commentary notes that the chapter-headings of Ma'aseh Merkabah may be taught, as was done by Rabbi ·∏§iyya. According to Yer. Hagigah ii. 1, the teacher read the headings of the chapters, after which, subject to the approval of the teacher, the pupil read to the end of the chapter,Hagigah 13a although Rabbi Zera said that even the chapter-headings might be communicated only to a person who was head of a school and was cautious in temperament. According to Rabbi Ammi, the secret doctrine might be entrusted only to one who possessed the five qualities enumerated in (being experienced in any of five different professions requiring good judgement), and a certain age is, of course, necessary. When R. Johanan wished to initiate R. Eliezer in the Ma'aseh Merkabah, the latter answered, \\"I am not yet old enough.\\" A boy who recognized the meaning of () was consumed by fire (Hagigah 13b), and the perils connected with the unauthorized discussion of these subjects are often described (Hagigah ii. 1; Shab. 80b). Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography: * Hamburger, R. B. T. ii., s.v. Geheimlehre; * Zunz, G. V. 2d ed., v. 171‚Äì173. Jewish development Later Medieval Kabbalah on the Knesset Menorah. Posture similar to earlier \\"descenders of merkabah\\", head between knees, also mentioned in the Talmud. Beyond the rabbinic community, Jewish apocalyptists also engaged in visionary exegeses concerning the divine realm and the divine creatures which are remarkably similar to the rabbinic material. A small number of texts unearthed at Qumran indicate that the Dead Sea community also engaged in merkabah exegesis. Recently uncovered Jewish mystical texts also evidence a deep affinity with the rabbinic merkabah homilies. The merkabah homilies eventually consisted of detailed descriptions of multiple layered heavens (usually Seven Heavens), often guarded over by angels, and encircled by flames and lightning. The highest heaven contains seven palaces (hekhalot), and in the innermost palace resides a supreme divine image (God's Glory or an angelic image) seated on a throne, surrounded by awesome hosts who sing God's praise. When these images were combined with an actual mystical experiential motif of individual ascent (paradoxically called \\"descent\\" in most texts, Yordei Merkabah, \\"descenders of the chariot\\", perhaps describing inward contemplation) and union is not precisely known. By inference, contemporary historians of Jewish mysticism usually date this development to the third century CE. Again, there is a significant dispute among historians over whether these ascent and unitive themes were the result of some foreign, usually Gnostic, influence, or a natural progression of religious dynamics within rabbinic Judaism. Maaseh Merkabah Maaseh Merkabah (Working of the Chariot) is the modern name given to a Hekhalot text, discovered by scholar Gershom Scholem.The Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic and Mysticism, Geoffrey W. Dennis (2007) Ma'aseh Merkavah: ‚ÄúWorking of the Chariot.‚Äù The modern name given to a Hekhalot text, discovered by scholar Gershom ... Ma'asei-Bereshit: ‚ÄúThe Workings of Creation.‚Äù Starting in antiquity, Jewish disciples of the esoteric have engaged ... Works of the Chariot dates from late Hellenistic period, after the end of the Second Temple period following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when the physical cult ceased to function. The idea of making a journey to the heavenly hekhal seems to be a kind of spiritualization of the pilgrimages to the earthly hekhal that were now no longer possible. It is a form of pre-Kabbalah Jewish mysticism that teaches both of the possibility of making a sublime journey to God and of the ability of man to draw down divine powers to earth; it seems to have been an esoteric movement that grew out of the priestly mysticism already evident in the Dead Sea Scrolls and some apocalyptic writings (see the studies by Rachel Elior).Elior, Rachel, Heikhalot Literature and Merkavah Tradition Ancient Jewish Mysticism and its Sources, Tel Aviv: Yediot Ahronot; Sifrei Hemed: 2004 (Hebrew). Several movements in Jewish mysticism and, later, students of the Kabbalah have focused on these passages from Ezekiel, seeking underlying meaning and the secrets of Creation in what they argued was the metaphoric language of the verses. Due to the concern of some Torah scholars that misunderstanding these passages as literal descriptions of God's image might lead to blasphemy or idolatry, there was great opposition to studying this topic without the proper initiation. Jewish biblical commentaries emphasize that the imagery of the merkabah is not meant to be taken literally; rather the chariot and its accompanying angels are analogies for the various ways that God reveals himself in this world.Maimonides, in his \\"Thirteen Principles of Faith\\", emphasizes that God is not limited to any particular form, as this prophecy might seem to imply. Hasidic philosophy and kabbalah discuss at length what each aspect of this vision represents in this world, and how the vision does not imply that God is made up of these forms. Jews customarily read the Biblical passages concerning the merkabah in the synagogue every year on the holiday of Shavuot, and the merkabah is also referenced in several places in traditional Jewish liturgy. Hekhalot literature The main interests of Hekhalot literature are accounts of divine visions, mystical ascents into heaven and observance of the divine council, and the summoning and control of great angels, usually for the purpose of gaining insight into Torah. The locus classicus for these practices is the biblical accounts of the Chariot vision of Ezekiel and the Temple vision of Isaiah (Chap. ). It is from these, and from the many extra-canonical apocalyptic writings of heavenly visitations, that hekhalot literature emerges. Still, it is distinctive from both Qumran literature and apocalyptic writings for several reasons, chief among them being that hekhalot literature is not at all interested in eschatology, largely ignores the unique status of the priesthood, has little interest in fallen angels or demonology, and it \\"democratizes\\" the possibility of divine ascent. In their visions, these mystics would enter into the celestial realms and journey through the seven stages of mystical ascent: the Seven Heavens and seven throne rooms. Such a journey is fraught with great danger, and the adept must not only have made elaborate purification preparation, but must also know the proper incantations, seals and angelic names needed to get past the fierce angelic guards, as well as know how to navigate the various forces at work inside and outside the palaces. This heavenly ascent is accomplished by the recital of hymns, as well as the theurgic use of secret names of God which abound in the Hekhalot literature. The Hekalot Zutarti in particular is concerned with the secret names of God and their powers: At times, heavenly interlocutors will reveal divine secrets. In some texts, the mystic‚Äôs interest extends to the heavenly music and liturgy, usually connected with the angelic adorations mentioned in Isaiah 6:3. The mantra-like repetitive nature of the liturgies recorded in many of these compositions seems meant to encourage further ascent. The ultimate goal of the ascent varies from text to text. In some cases, it seems to be a visionary glimpse of God, to \\"Behold the King in His Beauty\\". Others hint at \\"enthronement\\", that the adept be accepted among the angelic retinue of God and be given an honored seat. One text actually envisions the successful pilgrim getting to sit in God's \\"lap\\". Scholars such as Peter Schaefer and Elliot Wolfson see an erotic theology implied in this kind of image, though it must be said sexual motifs, while present in highly attenuated forms, are few and far between if one surveys the full scope of the literature. Literary works related to the Hekhalot tradition that have survived in whole or in part include Hekhalot Rabbati (or Pirkei Hekhalot), Hekhalot Zutarti, 3rd Enoch (also known as \\"Hebrew Enoch\\"), and Maaseh Merkabah. Michael Swartz, Mystical Prayer in Ancient Judaism: An Analysis of Ma ªaseh Merkava, Coronet Books Inc 1991 In addition there are many smaller and fragmentary manuscripts that seem to belong to this genre, but their exact relationship to Maaseh Merkabah mysticism and to each other is often not clear (Dennis, 2007, 199‚Äì120). Key texts The ascent texts are extant in four principal works, all redacted well after the third but certainly before the ninth century CE. They are: #Hekhalot Zutartey (\\"The Lesser Palaces\\"), which details an ascent of Rabbi Akiva; # Hekhalot Rabbati (\\"The Greater Palaces\\"), which details an ascent of Rabbi Ishmael; # Ma'aseh Merkabah (\\"Account of the Chariot\\"), a collection of hymns recited by the \\"descenders\\" and heard during their ascent; # Sepher Hekhalot (\\"Book of Palaces\\", also known as 3 Enoch), which recounts an ascent and divine transformation of the biblical figure Enoch into the archangel Metatron, as related by Rabbi Ishmael. A fifth work provides a detailed description of the Creator as seen by the \\"descenders\\" at the climax of their ascent. This work, preserved in various forms, is called Shi'ur Qomah (\\"Measurement of the Body\\"), and is rooted in a mystical exegesis of the Song of Songs, a book reputedly venerated by Rabbi Akiva. The literal message of the work was repulsive to those who maintained God's incorporeality; Maimonides (d. 1204) wrote that the book should be erased and all mention of its existence deleted. While throughout the era of merkabah mysticism the problem of creation was not of paramount importance, the treatise Sefer Yetzirah (\\"Book of Creation\\") represents an attempted cosmogony from within a merkabah milieu. This text was probably composed during the seventh century, and evidence suggests Neoplatonic, Pythagoric, and Stoic influences. It features a linguistic theory of creation in which God creates the universe by combining the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, along with emanations represented by the ten numerals, or sefirot. Hekhalot literature and \\"Four Entered Pardes\\" Tomb of Rabbi Akiva in Tiberias, northern Israel Moshe Idel, Gershom Scholem, Joseph Dan, and others have raised the natural question concerning the relationship between the \\"chambers\\" portion of the Hekhalot literature and the Babylonian Talmud's treatment of \\"The Work of the Chariot\\" in the presentation and analysis of such in the Gemara to tractate Hagigah of the Mishna. This portion of the Babylonian Talmud, which includes the famous \\"four entered pardes\\" material, runs from 12b-iv (wherein the Gemara's treatment of the \\"Work of Creation\\" flows into and becomes its treatment of \\"The Work of the Chariot\\") to and into 16a-i. (All references are to the ArtScroll pagination.) By making use of the Rabbinically paradigmatic figures of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael in their writings, the generators of the Hekhalot literature, quite arguably, seem to be attempting to show some sort of connection between their writings and the Chariot/Throne study and practice of the Rabbinic Movement in the decades immediately following upon the destruction of the Temple. However, in both the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonian Talmud the major players in this Chariot/Throne endeavor are, clearly, Rabbi Akiva and Elisha ben Abuyah who is referred to as \\"Akher\\". Neither Talmud presents Rabbi Ishmael as a player in Merkabah study and practice. In the long study on these matters contained in The Written' as the Vocation of Conceiving Jewishly\\" (McGinley, J W; 2006) the hypothesis is offered and defended that \\"Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha\\" (more often, simply \\"Rabbi Ishmael\\") is in fact a Rabbinically sanctioned cognomen for Elisha ben Abuyah who apostatized from the Rabbinic Movement. The argument is that through this indirection Rabbinic officialdom was able to integrate into the Gemaric give and take of argumentation and analysis the huge body of halakhic and hermeneutical teachings of this great Torah scholar without, however, honoring his equally significant apostasy. To be sure, in the accounting of this figure's mystical study and practice the pejorative (in context) \\"Akher\\" is used instead of \\"Rabbi Ishmael\\". This is because Elisha ben Abuyah's teachings under the heading of \\"The Work of the Chariot\\" came to be considered heretical in contrast to his halakhic and hermeneutical teachings which were generally admired‚Äîand whose weighty influence, in any case, could not be ignored. All of this indicates that the generators of the Hekhalot literature were indeed savvy in choosing \\"Rabbi Ishmael\\" as paradigmatic in their own writings as a means of relating their own endeavors to the mystical study and practices of the tannaim in the early decades following upon the destruction of the Temple. Both Akiva and the \\"Ishmaelic Akher\\" traded upon the \\"two- thrones\\"/\\"two-powers\\"-in-Heaven motif in their respective Merkabah-oriented undertakings. Akiva's version is memorialized in the Babylonian Gemara to tractate Hagigah at 14a-ii wherein Akiva puts forth the pairing of God and \\"David\\" in a messianic version of that mystical motif. Immediately after this Akivian \\"solution\\" to the puzzle of thrones referred to in Song of Songs and the two thrones spoken of in Daniel, Chapter , the text presents Akiva as being pressured‚Äîand then acquiescing to‚Äîa domesticated version of this twoness theme for the single Jewish God which would be acceptable to Rabbinic officialdom. The text offers Justice [din] and Charity (ts'daqqa) as the middot of God which are enthroned in Heaven. (Again, 14a-ii) Akher's non- Messianic and Metatron-oriented version of this \\"two-thrones\\"/\\"two-powers\\"-in- Heaven motif is discussed at length in the entry \\"Paradigmatia\\" of the above- mentioned study. The generic point in all of this is that by the time of the final editing of the Mishna this whole motif (along with other dimensions of Merkabah-oriented study and practice) came to be severely discouraged by Rabbinic officialdom. Those who still pursued these kinds of things were marginalized by the Rabbinic Movement over the next several centuries becoming, in effect, a separate grouping responsible for the Hekhalot literature. In the \\"four-entered-pardes\\" section of this portion of the Babylonian Gemara on tractate Hagigah, it is the figure of Akiva who seems to be lionized. For of the four he is the only one presented who ascended and descended \\"whole\\". The other three were broken, one way or another: Ben Azzai dies soon after; Ben Zoma is presented as going insane; and worst of all, \\"Akher\\" apostatizes. This putative lionization of Rabbi Akiva occurs at 15b-vi-16a-i of our Gemara section. The merkabah in later Jewish interpretations Maimonides' explanation Maimonides' philosophical 12th-century work Guide for the Perplexed is in part intended as an explanation of the passages Ma'aseh Bereshit and Ma'aseh Merkabah. In the third volume, Maimonides commences the exposition of the mystical passage of the mystic doctrines found in the merkabah passages, while justifying this \\"crossing of the line\\" from hints to direct instruction. Maimonides explains basic mystical concepts via the Biblical terms referring to Spheres, elements and Intelligences. In these chapters, however, there is still very little in terms of direct explanation. The Four Worlds of Kabbalah Kabbalah relates the Merkabah vision of Ezekiel and the Throne vision of Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1‚Äì8) describing the seraph angels, to its comprehensive Four Worlds. The highest World, Atziluth (\\"Emanation\\"‚ÄîDivine wisdom), is the realm of absolute Divine manifestation without self-awareness, metaphorically described in the vision as the likeness of a Man on the throne. The throne of sapphire is an etymological root in Kabbalah for the Sephirot divine powers. The second World, Beriah (\\"Creation\\"‚ÄîDivine understanding), is the first independent root creation, the realm of the Throne,Angels 2: Wings on Fire, kabbalaonline.org denoting God descending into Creation, as a king limits his true greatness and revealed posture when seated. The World of Beriah is the realm of the higher angels, the Seraphim (\\"burning\\" in ascent and descent as their understanding of God motivates self-annihilation). The third World, Yetzirah (\\"Formation\\"‚ÄîDivine emotions), is the realm of archetypal existence, the abode of the main Hayyot angels (\\"alive\\" with divine emotion). They are described with faces of a lion, ox and eagle, as their emotional nature is instinctive like animals, and they are the archetypal origins of creatures in this World. The lowest World, Assiah (\\"Action\\"‚ÄîDivine rulership), is the realm guided by the lower channels of the Ophanim (humble \\"ways\\" in realised creation). The Rabbinic Talmud compares Ezekiel and Isaiah's visions of God's Chariot-Throne, noticing that Ezekiel gives a lengthy account of details, while Isaiah is very brief. It gives an exoteric explanation for this; Isaiah prophesied in the era of Solomon's Temple, Ezekiel's vision took place in the exile of Babylonian captivity. Rava states in the Babylonian Talmud that although Ezekiel describes the appearance of the throne of God, this is not because he had seen more than Isaiah, but rather because the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar.Hagigah 13b Ezekiel, like all prophets except Moses, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly.Midrash Leviticus Rabbah i. 14, toward the end The Kabbalistic account explains this difference in terms of the Four Worlds. All prophecy emanates from the divine chokhmah (wisdom) realm of Atziluth. However, in order to be perceived it descends to be enclothed in vessels of lower Worlds. Isaiah's prophecy saw the Merkabah in the World of Beriah divine understanding, restraining his explanation by realising the inadequacy of description. Ezekiel saw the Merkabah in the lower World of Yetzirah divine emotions, causing him to describe the vision in rapturous detail. The two visions also form the Kedushah Jewish daily liturgy: According to the Kabbalistic explanation, the Seraphim (\\"burning\\" angels) in Beriah (divine understanding) realise their distance from the absolute divinity of Atziluth. Their call, \\"Holy\\", repeated three times, means removed or separated. This causes their \\"burning up\\" continual self-nullification, ascending to God and returning to their place. Their understanding realises instead that God's true purpose (glory) for creation is with lowly man. The lower Hayyot (\\"living\\" angels) in Yetzirah (divine emotions) say, \\"Blessed [etymologically in Kabbalah \\"drawing down\\" blessing] be the glory ... from His [distant-unknown to them] place\\" of Atziluth. Though lower than the Seraphim, their emotional self-awareness has a superior advantage of powerful desire. This causes them to be able to draw down divine vitality from a higher source, the supreme realm of Atziluth, to lower creation and man. In Ezekiel's vision, the Hayyot have a central role in the merkabah's channeling of the divine flow in creation. Hasidic explanation Hasidic thought explains Kabbalah in terms of human psychology. Through this, the Merkabah is a multi-layered analogy that offers insight into the nature of man, the ecosystem, the world, and teaches self-refinement. The four Hayyot angels represent the basic archetypes that God used to create the current nature of the world. Ophanim, which means \\"ways\\", are the ways these archetypes combine to create actual entities that exist in the world. For instance, in the basic elements of the world, the lion represents fire, the ox/earth, the man/water, and the eagle/air. However, in practice, everything in the world is some combination of all four, and the particular combination of each element that exist in each thing are its particular Ophanim or ways. The 'man on the throne' in the vision of Ezekiel descriptively represents God, who is controlling everything that goes on in the world, and how all of the archetypes He set up should interact. The 'man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when one looks at the way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act. This very lesson carries over to explain how the four basic groups of animals and the four basic archetypal philosophies and personalities reveal a higher, Godly source when one is able to read between the lines and see how these opposing forces can and do interact in harmony. A person should strive to be like a Merkaba, that is to say, he should realize all the different qualities, talents and inclinations he has (his angels). They may seem to contradict, but when one directs his life to a higher goal such as doing God's will he (the man on the chair driving the chariot) will see how they all can work together and even complement each other. Ultimately, we should strive to realize how all of the forces in the world, though they may seem to conflict, can unite when one knows how to use them all to fulfill a higher purpose; namely to serve God. Christianity Christian depiction of the four \\"animal\\" symbols of the Evangelists (in corners) According to Timo Eskola, early Christian theology and discourse was influenced by the Jewish Merkabah tradition.Timo Eskola, Messiah and the Throne: Jewish Merkabah Mysticism and Early Exaltation Discourse Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck (2001). Similarly, Alan Segal and Daniel Boyarin regard Paul the Apostle's accounts of his conversion experience and his ascent to the heavens (2 Corinthians 12:2‚Äì4) as the earliest first person accounts we have of a Merkabah mystic in Jewish or Christian literature. Timothy Churchill has argued that Paul's Damascus road encounter (e.g., Acts 9:1‚Äì9) does not fit the pattern of Merkabah, but this experience is not described in Paul's letters, and Acts does not claim to be a first-person account.Acts 1:1-2. See also Luke 1:1-4Churchill, Timothy W. R. Divine Initiative and the Christology of the Damascus Road Encounter, Eugene: Pickwick (2010). In Christianity, the man, lion, ox, and eagle are used as symbols for the four evangelists (or gospel-writers),The Book of Kells (reprint), Random House, 1993, p. 12, () and appear frequently in church decorations. These Creatures are called Zo√´ (or the Tetramorph), and surround the throne of God in Heaven, along with twenty-four elders and seven spirits of God (according to Revelation 4:1‚Äì11). Warnings against children or \\"excitable persons\\" reading the Ezekiel story exist in some translations.

He was the prime minister of the Republic of the Congo, from 2 August 1961 until 30 June 1964.  Early life and career  Cyrille Adoula was born to middle-class Bangala parents on 13 September 1921 in L√©opoldville, Belgian Congo. He attended a Catholic primary school in his youth and received secondary education at St. Joseph's Institute, graduating after five years of studies in 1941. That year he began working as a clerk for various commercial firms. He did this until 1952 when he accepted a senior position at the Belgian Congo Central Bank, becoming the first African to hold a significant post there. In 1948 he became a member of the Conseil pour le Travail et la Prevoyance Sociale Indigene. In 1954 Adoula joined the Belgian Socialist Party and subsequently became the representative for Action Socialiste in L√©opoldville. He also enrolled in the F√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail de Belgique. Once he became one of the top Congolese delegates in the association he resigned from his bank post and devoted his time to politics. In 1957 he attended the International Labour Conference in Geneva as an adviser to the Belgian delegation. At a F√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale conference in 1959 he successfully lobbied for the Congolese branch of the association to become independent, subsequently becoming secretary-general of the new federation's western chapter. In this capacity he traveled to West Germany and Israel to meet with other trade unionists and became a deputy committee member of the International Congress of Federated Trade Unions. He also cultivated a relationship with AFL‚ÄìCIO unionist Irving Brown.  Entry into national politics  In October 1958 a group of L√©opoldville √©volu√©s including Adoula, Patrice Lumumba and Joseph Il√©o established the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC). Diverse in membership, the party sought to peacefully achieve Congolese independence, promote the political education of the populace, and eliminate regionalism. Adoula became party vice president. While Lumumba became increasingly strident and nationalistic, Adoula remained relatively moderate. In 1959, he and Albert Kalonji made an unsuccessful attempt to oust Lumumba from the party and formed their own faction, MNC-Kalonji. With the independence of the Republic of the Congo the following summer, Adoula became a senator in Parliament, representing the city of Coquilhatville. Though elected by the √âquateur provincial assembly with the support of Parti de l'Unit√© Nationale, he identified himself as an independent. He requested that his membership of the International Congress of Federated Trade Unions be suspended so that he could devote his time to his new position. Nevertheless he remained well connected with trade unions and labour organisations. Patrice Lumumba became Prime Minister and offered Adoula a ministerial position in his government but the latter refused to accept it. Adoula expressed his dissatisfaction with the ultimate composition of the government and told Lumumba that he had erred in choosing to be Prime Minister of a cabinet that faced heavy criticism from different circles. The Congo fell into disorder shortly after independence, as the army's mutiny and the secession of the Katanga Province under Mo√Øse Tshombe created the Congo Crisis. Adoula increasingly distanced himself from Lumumba, but continuously lobbied that the United Nations Operation in the Congo use force to put down the rebellion in the proclaimed State of Katanga. President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba in September and appointed Il√©o to be his replacement, though Parliament refused to confirm him. Adoula briefly served as Il√©o's minister of interior. Lumumba was definitively removed from power and eventually killed in a coup by Colonel Joseph Mobutu, who forced a new government upon Kasa-Vubu. Adoula began attracting interest from the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a liberal, anti-communist alternative to Lumumba. In early 1961, the United States began to push for an Adoula-led government. United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk directed CIA agents to ensure that Adoula would become the next Congolese prime minister. The CIA acted in concert with other Western intelligence agencies in bribing Congolese parliamentarians to support Adoula. On 1 August Adoula was appointed formateur of a new government by Kasa-Vubu. The following day he presented his government to Parliament with himself as Prime Minister. Like Lumumba had before him, Adoula also gave himself responsibility over the national defence portfolio. The government was delivered a vote of confidence in the Chamber, 121 votes to none with one abstention, and the Senate voiced its support via acclamation.  As prime minister  Cyrille Adoula with United States President John F. Kennedy in 1962 Adoula managed to balance his cabinet with many former Lumumba supporters. Antoine Gizenga became deputy prime minister. Still, as his tenure progressed, Adoula faced a growing amount of opposition from the nationalist elements of MNC-Lumumba and Gizenga's faction of the Parti Solidaire Africain. He also never garnered much popular support across the country. As 1961 drew to a close, several Lumumba sympathisers withdrew from Adoula's government and Gizenga retired to Stanleyville. Gizenga's persisting counter-government in the east represented the first major challenge to Adoula's authority. In January 1962, Adoula was able to successfully arrest Gizenga. He subsequently removed the remaining Lumumba supporters from his government, thereby excluding the largest political force in the country from power. During his inaugural address following his investiture, Adoula declared that his government would \\"take adequate measures permitting each region to administer itself according to its own profound aspirations\\". Legislative efforts to achieve the goal immediately began but faced strong opposition from the Lumumbist bloc, which felt that the Katanga problem should be resolved before any discussion concerning the division of the provinces.  Foreign policy  On an international level, Adoula pursued a policy of neutrality. On 4 September 1961 he attended the Belgrade Conference that resulted in the foundation of the Non-Aligned Movement. = Angola = Adoula denounced Portuguese colonialism in neighboring Angola, which won him favour from the Afro-Asian bloc of non-aligned states. He actively supported the Frente Nacional de Liberta√ß√£o de Angola (FNLA) resistance group throughout his tenure and allowed it to maintain a base in the Congo near the southern border. This was in part attributed to his longstanding personal friendship with FNLA President Holden Roberto; the two had previously been teammates for the Congolese football side Daring Club Motema Pembe. Adoula also had an interest in winning the support of Angolan refugees in L√©opoldville, which grew in number after 1961. Furthermore, he hoped to undermine the Portuguese colonial authorities, which were rumored to be supporting Tshombe's efforts in mid-1963 to dislodge his administration. In November of that year his government forced one of the FNLA's chief rivals, the Movimento Popular de Liberta√ß√£o de Angola, to close its L√©opoldville offices and drove its leadership out of the city.  Attempted post-secession reconciliation and communist rebellion  Following the defeat of Katanga, Adoula organised a new \\"Government of Reconciliation\\" in April 1963. From Gizenga's arrest in early 1962 until Parliament's adjournment in September 1963, most of the dissent Adoula faced from the left came in the form of obstructionist activities in the legislative process. In October the radical Comit√© National de Lib√©ration (CNL) formed in Brazzaville with the goal of overthrowing Adoula's government. By December a CNL-instigated revolt had emerged in Kwilu Province. The larger Simba rebellion of 1964 saw much of the eastern Congo overrun by leftist guerrilla forces. During the run-up to new elections in the summer, three new political coalitions in the country emerged. One of these was the Rassemblement des d√©mocrates congolaise (RADECO), which consisted of 50 small organisations led by Jacques Massa. Centrist in ideology, it failed to amass much popular support. Adoula was elected as its president on 14 June. Still unable to contain the leftist insurrections, Adoula was forced by Kasa-Vubu to resign. He then voluntarily left the country.  Later life and career  Adoula in 1964 In a New Year's message at the beginning of 1965, Prime Minister Tshombe, Adoula's replacement, rejected conciliation with the rebels and called for their total defeat. Adoula dissented and put forth his own \\"African Plan\\" for the Congo in the weekly Jeune Afrique. He insisted that any long term solution for peace and stability required input from rebel leaders, emphasizing that since their defeat would require the use of European mercenaries, acting to suppress them would only increase the Congo's reliance on external forces. He also accused Tshombe of antagonizing opposition and called for the creation of a transitional government to oversee a settlement without him. Tshombe responded by blaming the conflict on Adoula, accusing him of weakening the central government and Balkanising the country by dividing the six original provinces into 22 new ones. Adoula returned to the Congo following Mobutu's seizure of power in November 1965. He was accommodating of Mobutu's new regime and served as the Congolese ambassador to the United States and Belgium. In 1969 he became Foreign Minister. He fell ill in May 1970. Mobutu took charge of the portfolio and Adoula retired from politics. In 1978 he suffered a heart attack and went to Lausanne, Switzerland for treatment. He succumbed to an illness and died there on 24 May 1978.  Beliefs  Adoula was an anti- clerical and a socialist. He was well known publicly for his belief in socialism, but it was non-Marxist in nature; he was an anti-communist. In December 1957 he explained his beliefs to Pr√©sence Africaine: > \\"Being a Socialist, I am for the transformation of the present society into > one benefiting the entire collectivity. And for this, I conceive the > collectivization of the means of production and the lower echelon workers of > the latter. In order to attain this goal, I only see one means: the struggle > of the classes, the permanent class struggle until this result is obtained.\\"  Legacy  In most written histories Adoula is portrayed as a weak, ineffective prime minister and a lackey of the United States government.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, Philadelphia Athletics (twice), and Cleveland Naps between 1896 and 1916. He managed the Naps from 1905 through 1909. Lajoie was signed to the National League's (NL) Phillies in 1896. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, the upstart American League (AL) was looking to rival the supremacy of the NL and in 1901, Lajoie and dozens of former National League players joined the American League. National League clubs contested the legality of contracts signed by players who jumped to the other league but eventually, Lajoie was allowed to play for Connie Mack's Athletics. During the season, Lajoie set the all-time American League single-season mark for the highest batting average (.426). One year later, Lajoie went to the Cleveland Bronchos where he would play until the 1915 season when he returned to play for Mack and the Athletics. While with Cleveland, Lajoie's popularity led to locals electing to change the club's team name from Bronchos to Napoleons (\\"Naps\\" for short), which remained until after Lajoie departed Cleveland and the name was changed to Indians (the team's present-day name). Lajoie led the AL in batting average five times in his career and four times recorded the highest number of hits. During several of those years with the Naps he and Ty Cobb dominated AL hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other, most notably coming in 1910, when the league's batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the season and after an investigation by American League President Ban Johnson. Lajoie in 1914 joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner as the only major league players to record 3,000 career hits. He led the NL or AL in putouts five times in his career and assists three times. He has been called \\"the best second baseman in the history of baseball\\" and \\"the most outstanding player to wear a Cleveland uniform.\\" Cy Young said, \\"Lajoie was one of the most rugged players I ever faced. He'd take your leg off with a line drive, turn the third baseman around like a swinging door and powder the hand of the left fielder.\\" He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. Early life Lajoie was born on September 5, 1874, in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, to Jean Baptiste and Celina Guertin Lajoie. The elder Lajoie was French-Canadian and had emigrated to the United States. Upon arrival to the U.S. he first settled in Rutland, Vermont, but then moved to Woonsocket, where Lajoie, the youngest of eight surviving children, was born. Throughout his childhood Lajoie received little formal education. The elder Lajoie, who worked as a teamster and laborer, died not long into the younger Lajoie's childhood, which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family. Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team under the alias \\"Sandy\\", because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called \\"Slugging Cabby.\\" \\"When I told my father I had decided to take the job he was very angry. He shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them, but I was determined to give it a try at least one season,\\" Lajoie later said. He also received the nickname \\"Larry\\" from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie. Lajoie admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn. When word of Lajoie's baseball ability spread, he began to play for other semi-professional teams at $2 to $5 per game ($ to $ in current dollar terms). He also worked as a teamster. He left Woonsocket and his $7.50 per week ($ in current dollar terms) working as a taxi driver and joined the Class B New England League's Fall River Indians in 1896. Lajoie played as a center fielder, first baseman and catcher, earning $25 weekly ($ in current dollar terms). He recorded 163 hits in 80 games, and led the team in batting average, doubles, triples, home runs and hits. Lajoie was \\"widely regarded as an outstanding prospect\\" and Indians owner Charlie Marston rejected an offer from the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lajoie in exchange for $500 ($ in current dollar terms). He was also scouted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Beaneaters. Major league career Philadelphia Phillies and Athletics The Philadelphia Phillies of the MLB's National League (NL) purchased Lajoie and teammate Phil Geier from Fall River for $1,500 ($ in current dollar terms) on August 9. Phillies' manager Billy Nash originally went to Fall River intending to sign Geier only but obtained Lajoie when the team agreed to include him in their asking price. Author David Jordan wrote: > A legend later grew up that Geier was the main target of Nash's pursuit and > that Marston 'threw in' Lajoie in order to get the Phillies to pay the > $1,500 asking price. This is hardly likely. While Geier was considered a > good prospect, Lajoie was banging the ball at a .429 clip in his first > professional season, was a fine fielder, and had already been sought by > several big league clubs. Nap Lajoie clearly represented a financial asset > to Marston, who did not give him away. The price the Phillies paid was a > substantial sum for two minor leaguers in 1896. Against the Washington Senators on August 12, 1896, Lajoie made his major league debut. He played first base and recorded a single. Ed Delahanty was being considered to play the first base position after Dan Brouthers retired. Delahanty, however, wanted Lajoie to play first so he could return to his natural position of left field. Delahanty said to Lajoie, \\"Look, sonny, you tell the boss you're a first baseman and you and me are gonna get along.\\" Lajoie became the team's first baseman and by the end of the season, he and Delahanty were roommates. Later in 1898, new manager George Stallings moved Lajoie to second base, commenting that \\"[Lajoie would] have made good no matter where I positioned him.\\" Lajoie hit .363 and led the NL in slugging percentage in 1897 and doubles and RBIs in 1898. He had a .378 batting average in 1899, though he played only 77 games due to an injury. In 1900, he missed five weeks due to a broken thumb suffered in a fistfight with teammate Elmer Flick. John Rogers, described as a \\"penny-pinching\\" majority owner of the Phillies, assured Lajoie that he would make the same salary as Delahanty. However, Lajoie discovered that while he was earning $2,600 ($ in current dollar terms), Delahanty earned $3,000 ($ in current dollar terms) (contracts for NL players were not allowed to surpass $2,400). Rogers increased Lajoie's pay by $200 but the damage had already been done. \\"Because I felt I had been cheated, I was determined to listen to any reasonable American League offer\\", Lajoie said. In 1901, the newly created American League had attracted several of the top players in the competing National League to join its ranks. Rogers declined Lajoie's request for an increase in salary and as a result, Lajoie jumped to the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics, owned by former Phillies' part-owner Benjamin Shibe and managed by Connie Mack. Frank Hough offered Lajoie the contract on behalf of Mack. \\"Hough offered me $24,000 ($ in current dollar terms) for four years. You can bet I signed in a hurry\\", Lajoie said. Lajoie was considered \\"the first superstar\\" to join the newly formed AL. He was also the first player whose yearly salary was for $4,000 ($ in current dollar terms). \\"The Phillies opened their season and drew 6,000 fans. A week later, when we opened, there were 16,000 in the stands. The American League was here to stay\\", Lajoie later said. Lajoie's batting average that year was .426 (it was originally recorded at .405, later changed to .422 before finally revised again to .426). The batting average mark became the all-time AL record after the number was revised. Previously, Ty Cobb and George Sisler had been credited with having the AL's all-time mark. That same year in a game against the Chicago White Sox' Clark Griffith, Lajoie became the second Major Leaguer to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded in an 11-7 game after Abner Dalrymple in 1881. For the 1901 season, Lajoie led the majors in doubles (48), and led the majors in hits (232), batting average (.426), runs (145), on-base (.463) and slugging percentage (.643), and total bases (350). His 125 RBIs led the AL and his 14 home runs were a career-best and his 48 doubles are a Philadelphia Athletics' record. Mack said of Lajoie, \\"He plays so naturally and so easily it looks like lack of effort.\\" Author Robert Kelly writes: \\"The .422 batting average of Lajoie still stands as an AL record. To some degree, however, it is tainted. The 1901 season was the first for the AL and the level of competition was presumably evolving. Such questions, however, in no way cast doubt on the extraordinary batting ability of the second baseman.\\" Lajoie c. 1908 In April 1902, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overruled an earlier decision by the Court of Common Pleas and upheld the reserve clause in contracts between players and NL clubs. President of the Chicago National League Club Jim Hart said the state Supreme Court's decision had dealt \\"a fatal blow to the rival league\\" and NL clubs \\"have won a great victory.\\" The Phillies' Rogers obtained an injunction barring Lajoie from playing baseball for any team other than his team. However, a lawyer discovered that the injunction was enforceable only in the state of Pennsylvania. The courts ruled that the reserve clause was not valid for players who signed with an AL team. Mack responded by trading Lajoie and Bill Bernhard to the then-moribund Cleveland Bronchos, whose owner, Charles Somers, had provided considerable financial assistance to the A's in the early years. Lajoie was also pursued by Charles Comiskey, owner of the Chicago White Sox. Cleveland Bronchos/Naps Lajoie, nicknamed \\"The Frenchman\\" and considered baseball's most famous player at the time, arrived in Cleveland on June 4 and his play was immediately met with approval from fans. The Bronchos drew 10,000 fans to League Park in Lajoie's first game. The Bronchos' record at the time Lajoie and fellow Athletics teammate, Bill Bernhard, joined was 11-24 and improved to 12-24 after the team's inaugural game with their new players, a 4-3 win over the Boston Americans. The team went on to finish 69-67, fifth in the AL, for the franchise's first winning record since the AL began as a league. After his first season with the Bronchos, Lajoie's .378 average led all AL players. New York Giants manager, John McGraw, was rumored to want to sign Lajoie but Lajoie stated his intentions when he said \\"...for I intend to stick to Cleveland.\\" For the remainder of 1902 and most of 1903, Lajoie and Flick traveled separately from the rest of the team, needing to avoid entering Pennsylvania so as to avoid a subpoena (the only team they could legally play with inside state limits was the Phillies). When the Naps went to play in Philadelphia, Lajoie and Bernhard would go to nearby Atlantic City to help pass the time. The issue was finally resolved when the leagues made peace through the National Agreement in September 1903 (which also brought the formation of the World Series). To begin the 1903 season, the club changed its name from the Bronchos to the Naps in honor of Lajoie after a readers' poll result was released by the Cleveland Press. (The team was officially the Blues in their inaugural AL season but changed to the Bronchos for the 1902 season.) The Bronchos finished the season 77-63 and Lajoie finished his first full season with the club again the AL's batting champion with a .344 average. He also led the league in slugging percentage (.518), finished second in doubles (41), third in RBIs (93) and tied for fifth in home runs (7). In the off- season he contracted pleurisy. During the 1904 season, Lajoie received a suspension after he spat tobacco juice in an umpire's eye. He later informally replaced Bill Armour as the team's manager (Armour submitted his resignation on September 9 but as team captain, Lajoie had already been acting as the Naps' field manager). After the season had concluded, Lajoie was officially named manager. He still managed to lead the majors with a .376 batting average as he recorded his second consecutive league batting title. He also led the majors in hits (208), doubles (49), RBIs (102) and slugging percentage (.546). Lajoie forbade his players from card playing and gambling during the regular season. As a manager, Lajoie was also described as \\"much too lenient with his players.\\" Lajoie contracted sepsis from an untreated spike injury after a game in July 1905. Dye from Lajoie's stockings entered his bloodstream and led to blood poisoning. (A rule was put into place requiring white socks to be worn underneath a player's colored socks.) The injury worsened and Lajoie eventually came to games in a wheelchair. Amputation of the affected leg was also discussed. The injury and illness kept Lajoie out until August 28 when he began play again and returned as the team's first baseman. Before the season was over he also sustained an injury to his ankle from a foul tip during an at bat and missed the remainder of the season (he continued to manage from the bench). He finished the season having only appeared in 65 games (a career-low, other than his rookie season when he was not called up until well after the season had begun). The Naps finished with a 76-78 record in a season in which they had been 52‚Äì29, and held a three-game lead in the American League on July 24th Baseball historian Bill James wrote of Lajoie's higher-than-normal career putout total and importance to Cleveland: > Nap Lajoie was not only the team's superstar, after 1905 he was also the > manager. He was more than that--hell, the team was actually called the > \\"Naps\\" in his honor, as if Lajoie was the team. If Lajoie was in the habit > of covering second base every play, the shortstop certainly wasn't going to > tell him not to. Lajoie led the majors in 1906 in hits (214) and doubles (48) and the Naps finished third in the AL again with a winning record, 89-64. Lajoie finished second in the AL to George Stone in batting average, slugging and on-base percentage. In 1906 he married Myrtle Smith and the couple moved to a small farm outside Cleveland. In June of the 1907 season, Lajoie's .296 average, \\"an average even now that scores of players would be glad to accept,\\" put him at risk for hitting below .300 for the first time in his career. He also missed 15 games due to a recurrence of sepsis which he contracted during the 1905 season. Lajoie and Naps first baseman George Stovall got into an argument in a hotel lobby and Stovall broke a chair over Lajoie's head. \\"George didn't mean anything by it\\", Lajoie said, and the two maintained a working relationship. He finished the season with an average of .299. Naps owner Charles Somers received a trade offer from the Detroit Tigers for the Naps' Elmer Flick and Tigers' Ty Cobb. Tigers manager Hughie Jennings called Somers and told him he was offering the trade because Cobb was not getting along with several teammates. Somers decided to retain Flick, saying, \\"We'll keep Flick. Maybe he isn't as good a batter as Cobb, but he's much nicer to have on the team.\\" The Naps finished the regular season in second place to the Tigers with a 90-64 record, a half-game behind the Tigers (who finished 90-63 and were not forced to make-up a rained out game in accordance with league rules). Lajoie was partly blamed for the Naps' second-place finish. Author Fred McMane described an instance during the season between Naps catcher Nig Clarke and Lajoie. > Clarke ... was newly married and asked Lajoie for a day off so that he could > go home. Lajoie refused. Clarke sulked and walked over to warm up pitcher > Addie Joss. On the first pitch, he stuck out a finger and the ball broke it > cleanly. With blood streaming from his hand, Clarke waved it defiantly in > front of Lajoie. \\"Now can I go home?\\" asked Clarke. He was out five weeks, > and Cleveland lost the pennant to Detroit by half a game. Lajoie finished the season tied for third-most in hits (168) while Cobb's batting average, slugging and on-base percentages, and hit total led the American League. Baseball historians have suggested the managerial duties Lajoie took on affected his offensive numbers. Lajoie's dissatisfaction with the Naps' play worsened. \\"You can't win in the major leagues unless you have players who know the game. We don't have time to teach and train youngsters up here. Our job is to win pennants, not run schools\\", he said. Franklin Lewis, sports writer and author, wrote \\"Lajoie, in spite of his marvelous fielding and tremendous batting, was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager.\\" Lajoie recommended to Somers on August 17, 1909, he find the team a new manager, although he wanted to remain on the club as a player. Somers responded to Lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when Lajoie came back days later and announced the same decision, Somers acted quickly to find a replacement. Lajoie later described the decision to take on the added duties as a player-manager as the biggest mistake of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play. The highest-paid player in the league, he also offered a $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) reduction in salary. Somers promoted Naps coach Deacon \\"Jim\\" McGuire to manager. The team finished 71-82 while Lajoie's .324 average was third in the AL and 33 doubles second. The Naps finished 1910 71-81 but Lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors with a .384 average and 227 hits, both categories bettered only in Lajoie's 1901 campaign. His 51 doubles, a career- high, and 304 total bases led the majors, the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the majors in the latter category. Lajoie missed significant parts of back-to-back seasons, the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games. Stovall, the former Naps first baseman, replaced McGuire as the club's manager and the Naps finished 80-73. Lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in May during a practice session in Chicago. He played in 117 games on the season, an increase of the 90 he played in one season before, but Cleveland, who had hired Joe Birmingham as the team's fifth manager since Lajoie gave up the role in 1909, finished 75-78. Lajoie and Joe Jackson tied for the team lead with 90 RBIs. He finished fourth in the AL with a .368 batting average. In 1913, Birmingham and Lajoie had arguments in the open, including one incident in June when Lajoie cursed Birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump. Lajoie hit .335 on the year, the last time he would hit over .300 in his career. Only two other major league players had attained 3,000 career hits until Lajoie hit a double on September 27, 1914, and so joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner in the 3,000 hit club. Lajoie recorded the hit off Yankees pitcher Marty McHale in a 5-3 Naps win. His .258 batting average for the season, however, was the lowest since he had joined the majors in 1896. The Naps finished in last place in the American League standings with a 51-102 record, their worst record since joining the league and the franchise's lowest winning percentage (.333). Lajoie requested that Somers trade him and the club obliged, selling Lajoie to the Athletics for the waiver price and in so doing, Lajoie returned to Philadelphia. Philadelphia Athletics The following season, 1915, Lajoie returned to the Athletics when Mack signed him to a contract. In his first season back with the Athletics, he finished with a .280 batting average but the team ended the season in last place with a 43-109 record. The 1916 season would be Lajoie's last in the majors. In his final major league game, he hit a triple to help Athletics pitcher Joe Bush win his no-hitter. Lajoie, aged 41 years, played in 113 games and finished with a .246 average. Philadelphia's season record was worse than the previous season's franchise-low record, and the team finished in last place again with a 36-117 record. The Athletics' winning percentage (.235) is the franchise's worst winning percentage (through 2012 season). Minor leagues and retirement In 1917, Lajoie joined the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League as manager. At the age of 42, Lajoie won the league's batting title with batting average of .380. He appeared in 151 of 156 games and for the first time in his career, played on a team that won a pennant. He later was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers for $3,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in March 1918 but the contract was annulled by the Commissioner's office and made a free agent to which Lajoie was \\"well pleased\\". Later that same year he joined the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association as player-manager. He helped lead the team to a third-place finish but the season was impacted due to the U.S.'s involvement in World War I. Lajoie made his services available to the draft board but they rejected his offer. On December 27, 1918, Lajoie announced his retirement from baseball. Several years after his retirement, a story in The Milwaukee Sentinel talked of Lajoie's ability to \\"outguess any pitcher.\\" Lajoie faced pitcher Red Donahue, who avoided pitching fastballs to Lajoie after seeing him go 4-for-4 against a fellow pitcher. Donahue instead made pitches on the outside corner, to which Lajoie reached over \\"and hit them with ease.\\" Donahue then aimed a pitch at Lajoie's head and he proceeded to hit a home run. \\"That's the kind I eat\\", he said. Rivalry with Ty Cobb Nap Lajoie on a 1911 American Tobacco Company baseball card For the first part of the 20th century, Lajoie and Cobb's statistics rivaled each other like few other players in the American League. In 1908, Honus Wagner and Lajoie recorded their 2,000th career hit. Baseball historian David Anderson wrote: > Nap Lajoie reached the milestone later in the summer with even less hoopla, > in an age when individual records received little attention from the press > and were generally scorned by many players. Players overly worried about > their individual stats were often unpopular with teammates. The modesty of > Wagner and Lajoie over their achievements contrasted sharply with Cobb's > ambition and overriding interest in his individual numbers. The Lajoie-Cobb rivalry reached a peak in 1910, when Hugh Chalmers of the Chalmers Auto Company (a direct predecessor to modern-day Chrysler) promised a Chalmers 30 Roadster to the season's batting champion. The public became fascinated with the daily statistics of Lajoie and Cobb in what became known as the Chalmers Race. Sports bettors, who by this time followed the sport attentively, also followed the daily reports with interest. Cobb took the final two games, a doubleheader, off against the Chicago White Sox, confident that his average was safe and would allow him to win the AL batting title‚Äîunless Lajoie had a near-perfect final day. Going into the final game of the season, Cobb's average led Lajoie's, .383 to .376. Lajoie and the Naps faced a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns in Sportsman's Park, Cleveland's final two games of the season. After a sun-hindered fly ball went for a stand-up triple and another batted ball landed for a cleanly hit single, Lajoie had five subsequent hits ‚Äì bunt singles dropped in front of rookie third baseman Red Corriden (whose normal position was shortstop), who was playing closer to shallow left field on orders, it has been suggested, of manager Jack O'Connor. In his second at bat of the second game, Lajoie reached base on another bunt but the runner on first base advanced. According to the rules of that time, the hit was scored a sacrifice and thus, Lajoie did not record an official at-bat. He finished the doubleheader a perfect 8-for-8 and his batting average increased to .384, .001 greater than Cobb's mark. Although the AL office had not officially announced the results, Lajoie began to receive congratulations from fans and players, including eight of Cobb's Detroit Tigers teammates. Most players in the league preferred Lajoie's personality to that of Cobb's. Coach Harry Howell is reported to have said to the game's official scorer, E. V. Parish, \\"to do well by Lajoie.\\" Howell was reported to have offered a bribe to Parish, which described in Al Stump's biography of Cobb, was a $40 ($ in current dollar terms) suit. Parish refused the offer and the resulting uproar ended in O'Connor and Howell being banned from the major leagues by AL President Ban Johnson. Johnson had the matter investigated, and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader statistics re- checked, discovered only the first game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested actual batting average at .385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Lajoie initially refused the car, but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, \\"I am glad that I won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I have no one to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely.\\" Lajoie said, \\"I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, I am glad that the controversy is over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success.\\" The Sporting News published an article written by Paul MacFarlane in its April 18, 1981, issue where historian Pete Palmer had discovered that while Cobb's September 24 doubleheader was not correctly tabulated (perhaps purposefully) according to the correct date, the second game's statistics were in fact included in the next day's ledger, thus incorrectly recording a second 2-for-3 performance from Cobb which meant Lajoie's average was greater.

Legacy Nap Lajoie's plaque at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum Lajoie ended his career with a lifetime .338 batting average. His career total of 3,243 hits was the second-most in MLB history at the time of his retirement, behind only Honus Wagner's total (3,420). Lajoie's 2,522 hits in the American League was that league's record until Cobb surpassed his mark. He was among the second group of players elected to the Hall of Fame in 1937 and was later inducted on June 12, 1939, when the Hall opened that same year. Lajoie obtained the greatest number of votes as he led induction mates Tris Speaker (165 votes) and Cy Young (153) with 168 votes (83.6 percent of ballots) from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Lajoie led all second basemen in the NL in putouts (1898) and the AL four times in his career (1901, 1903, 1906, and 1908). From 1906-1908 he led the AL in assists (amongst second basemen). He also led the league in double plays six times in his career. Baseball historian William McNeil rates Lajoie as the game's greatest second baseman, when combining both offensive and defensive impact. Bill James argues, \\"In the last 20 years several statistical analysts ... have credited Lajoie with immense defensive value ... this analysis is incorrect. He was a competent fielder, even a good fielder. He was not a defensive superstar.\\" During spring training before the 1928 season, Lajoie commented on the 1927 New York Yankees. \\"Of course, you could see a lot of loafing going on but if that club is the greatest of all times, you just know that we had a lot of clubs in my time who were world champions and didn't know it.\\" He died in Daytona Beach, Florida on February 7, 1959, at the age of 84 from complications associated with pneumonia. He had fallen in the autumn of 1958 and fractured his arm. His wife had died earlier in 1951. In 1999, he ranked number 29 on The Sporting News' list of the \\"100 Greatest Baseball Players\\", and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Lajoie is mentioned in the poem \\"Line-Up for Yesterday\\" by Ogden Nash: In Ring Lardner's 1911 baseball song, \\"Gee, It's a Wonderful Game\\", a stanza refers to Lajoie: Who lost out in the battle of old Waterloo? I don't know, I don't know They say 'twas Na-po-le-on Maybe it's true Maybe so, I don't know The pink sheets don't print Mr. Bonaparte's face No stories about him today 'Cause he never could hold down That old second base Like his name sake Big Nap Lay'-ooh-way Footnotes * Major League Baseball has not revised Cobb's batting average, which would then designate Lajoie as the 1910 batting champion. The Sporting News wrote of statistical evidence showing Cobb's 1910 season statistics had been tampered with and he was given two extra base hits but MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn declined to announce Lajoie the winner. Both the Society for American Baseball Research and Baseball-Reference.com list Lajoie as having the higher batting average and thus, the batting champion.

Cote also sat on the JP Morgan Chase risk committee during the period in which the firm lost $6 billion trading credit derivatives. Cote stepped down as CEO at Honeywell at the end of March 2017 and was succeeded by Darius Adamczyk.  Early life  Cote was born in Manchester, New Hampshire and graduated from Pembroke Academy in Pembroke, New Hampshire in 1970. The following year, Cote enrolled at the University of New Hampshire, and while attending UNH full-time, he worked an hourly job on the night shift at a nearby GE jet engine plant. In 1976, he graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a bachelor's degree in business administration.  Career  General Electric Cote joined General Electric full-time in November 1976, and worked there for more than twenty years. He transitioned from his hourly production work at the General Electric aircraft-engine plant in New Hampshire to a full-time auditing job at another GE plant in Massachusetts. In 1985, his handling of an interaction with CEO Jack Welch became the catalyst for Cote's advancement at GE. Welch promoted Cote three levels of management. Over his career there, he held positions in manufacturing, finance, marketing, strategic planning and general management, before becoming CEO of GE Appliances in 1996. TRW In November 1999, Cote joined TRW as president and COO where he introduced the Six Sigma management system to reduce defects in manufacturing. In February 2001, Cote was appointed CEO, and later chairman of the board. Archived at Internet Archive. Cote led the creation of the TRW subsidiary Velocium, which manufactured ultra-high-speed semiconductors. In February 2002, Cote announced he would be leaving TRW. Reportedly, the news surprised employees and some executives, who learned of Cote's departure hours before the announcement.Pasztor, Andy \\"Honeywell Names TRW's Cote As Successor to Retiring Chairman\\", Wall Street Journal, A.June 6, 26, 2010. Honeywell Honeywell selected Cote as successor to Lawrence Bossidy, following the AlliedSignal acquisition of Honeywell and European Union's rejection of Honeywell's merger with General Electric. Cote was elected CEO, president, and a member of the board of directors on February 19, 2002. He was elected chairman of the board on July 1, 2002. The year Cote took office, Honeywell lost $220 million. Cote instituted conservative accounting to streamline costs. In an effort to reduce the unpredictability of asbestos-plus- environmental expenses, Honeywell established a trust for claims and reclaim soil at chemical plants. As a result, that expense is consistently $150 million a year, after-tax. Honeywell saw improved quality in design, increased production, and lower production costs after it implemented a new productivity management system. During the 2008-2009 recession, the company instituted furloughs to reduce overall operating costs rather than lay off workers.Cote, David \\"Honeywell‚Äôs CEO on How He Avoided Layoffs\\", Harvard Business Review, June 2013. During his tenure at Honeywell, the company's donations via its Political Action Committee rose from rose from two hundred thousand dollars in 2002 to 8 million in 2014. As of June 2016, Honeywell's market value has risen from $28 billion to $87 billion since 2002. While CEO of Honeywell International in 2015, Cote earned a total compensation of US$25,053,000 which included a base salary of $1,890,000, an annual bonus of $5,700,000, and $10,338,000 in stock options. Cote stepped down as CEO at Honeywell at the end of March 2017 and was succeeded by Darius Adamczyk. Cote continued as executive chairman through April 2018. Appointments Banking Cote was a member of the board of directors at JPMorgan Chase and an advisor to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). In 2012, Cote came under criticism as one of the three members of JP Morgan Chase's risk committee, after CEO Jamie Dimon said on May 10, 2012 that the firm's chief investment office suffered a $2 billion loss trading credit derivatives. Commentators identified a lack of relevant expertise among the members of the committee, identifying Cote and a museum official who also served, in particular for their lack of banking experience.\\"JPMorgan Gave Risk Oversight to Museum Head With AIG Role\\".

Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, writing in The New York Times, raised doubts about the suitability of Cote's appointment, noting the \\"systematic breakdown of compliance and risk control\\" during the period when Cote was on the board of JPMorgan Chase, whilst also noting that some, but not all, of the problems there pre-dated Cote's appointment.\\"Two Steps Forward and One Step Back for the Federal Reserve\\" Simon Johnson, The New York Times, February 20, 2014.

In February 2010, Cote was selected by President Obama to be on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, more commonly known as the Simpson Bowles Commission. Attitude to deficit reduction Cote is a co- founder of Fix the Debt, a group of executives and former legislators who campaign for deficit reduction and tax reform. In a 2013 interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader, Cote identified the problem of debt reduction in the United States as being the fact that \\"Washington is ruled by fear of voters ... and the three 'h's' prevail‚Äîhysteria, histrionics and hyperbole\\". He also framed the options for deficit reduction in terms of either increases in taxes or a reduction in social security benefits, saying, \\"If you have people saying, 'Don't raise my taxes, but don't cut my benefits,' it makes it really difficult to get anything done.\\"\\"Honeywell CEO, a Manchester native, takes on deficit, Social Security crisis\\".

Tracing back to the foundation sire Figure, later named Justin Morgan after his best-known owner, Morgans served many roles in 19th-century American history, being used as coach horses and for harness racing, as general riding animals, and as cavalry horses during the American Civil War on both sides of the conflict. Morgans have influenced other major American breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, Tennessee Walking Horse and the Standardbred. During the 19th and 20th centuries, they were exported to other countries, including England, where a Morgan stallion influenced the breeding of the Hackney horse. In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm near Middlebury, Vermont for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed; the farm was later transferred to the University of Vermont.The first breed registry was established in 1909, and since then many organizations in the US, Europe and Oceania have developed. There were estimated to be over 175,000 Morgan horses worldwide in 2005. The Morgan is a compact, refined breed, generally bay, black or chestnut in color, although they come in many colors, including several variations of pinto. Used in both English and Western disciplines, the breed is known for its versatility. The Morgan is the state animal of Vermont and the state horse of Massachusetts and the state mammal of Rhode Island. Popular children's authors, including Marguerite Henry and Ellen Feld, have portrayed the breed in their books; Henry's Justin Morgan Had a Horse was later made into a Disney movie. Breed characteristics A Morgan in horse show competition There is officially one breed standard for the Morgan type, regardless of the discipline or bloodline of the individual horse. Compact and refined in build, the Morgan has strong legs, an expressive head with a straight or slightly convex profile and broad forehead; large, prominent eyes; well-defined withers, laid back shoulders, and an upright, well arched neck. The back is short, and hindquarters are strongly muscled, with a long and well-muscled croup. The tail is attached high and carried gracefully and straight. Morgans appear to be a strong powerful horse, and the breed is well known as an easy keeper. The breed standard for height ranges from , with some individuals over and under. Gaits, particularly the trot are \\"animated, elastic, square, and collected,\\" with the front and rear legs balanced. A few Morgans are gaited, meaning they can perform an intermediate speed gait other than the trot such as the rack, fox trot, or pace. The United States Equestrian Federation states, \\"a Morgan is distinctive for its stamina and vigor, personality and eagerness and strong natural way of moving.\\" The breed has a reputation for intelligence, courage and a good disposition. Registered Morgans come in a variety of colors although they are most commonly bay, black, and chestnut. Less common colors include gray, roan, dun, silver dapple, and cream dilutions such as palomino, buckskin, cremello and perlino. In addition, three pinto color patterns are also recognized: sabino, frame overo, and splashed white. The tobiano pattern has not been noted in Morgans. One genetic disease has been identified within the Morgan breed. This is Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy, an autosomal dominant muscle disease found mainly in stock horse and draft horse breeds caused by a missense mutation in the GYS1 gene. Morgans are one of over a dozen breeds found to have the allele for the condition, though its prevalence in Morgans appears to be quite low compared to stock and draft breeds. In one study, less than one percent of randomly tested Morgans carried the allele for this condition, one of the lowest percentages amongst breeds in that study. Two coat color genes found in Morgans have also been linked to genetic disorders. One is the genetic ocular syndrome multiple congenital ocular anomalies (MCOA), originally called equine anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). MCOA is characterized by the abnormal development of some ocular tissues, which causes compromised vision, although generally of a mild form; the disease is non-progressive. Genetic studies have shown that it is closely tied to the silver dapple gene. A small number of Morgans carry the silver dapple allele, which causes cysts but no apparent vision problems if heterozygous, but when homozygous can cause vision problems. There is also the possibility of lethal white syndrome, a fatal disease seen in foals who are homozygous for the frame overo gene. At present, there is one mare line in the Morgan breed that has produced healthy heterozygous frame overo individuals. The American Morgan Horse Association advocates genetic testing to identify carriers of these genetics, and advises owners to avoid breeding horses that are heterozygous for frame overo to each other. Breed history A Morgan horse with rider in colonial attire at the Kentucky Horse Park. Costuming intended to resemble Justin Morgan and Figure. Justin Morgan All Morgans trace back to a single foundation sire, a stallion named Figure, who was born in West Springfield, Massachusetts in 1789. In 1792, he was given to a man named Justin Morgan as a debt payment. The horse later came to be identified by the name of this particular owner, and \\"the Justin Morgan horse\\" evolved into the name of the breed. Figure is thought to have stood about , and to have weighed about . He was known for his prepotency, passing on his distinctive looks, conformation, temperament, and athleticism. His exact pedigree is unknown, although extensive efforts have been made to discover his parentage. One historian notes that the writings on the possibility of his sire being a Thoroughbred named Beautiful Bay would \\"fill 41 detective novels and a membership application for the Liars' Club.\\" In 1821, Figure was kicked by another horse and later died of his injuries. He was buried in Tunbridge, Vermont. Although Figure was used extensively as a breeding stallion, records are known to exist for only six of his sons, three of whom became notable as foundation bloodstock for the Morgan breed. Woodbury, a chestnut, stood high and stood for many years at stud in New England. Bulrush, a dark bay the same size as Figure, was known for his endurance and speed in harness. Best known was Sherman, another chestnut stallion, slightly shorter than Figure, who in turn was the sire and grandsire of Black Hawk and Ethan Allen. Black Hawk, born in 1833, went on to become a foundation stallion for the Standardbred, American Saddlebred and Tennessee Walking Horse breeds, and was known for his unbeaten harness racing record. Ethan Allen, sired by Black Hawk in 1849, is another important sire in the history of the Morgan breed, and was known for his speed in trotting races. Breed development Morgan horse, 1887 In the 19th century, Morgans were recognized for their utilitarian capabilities. They were used extensively for harness racing, as well as for pulling coaches, due to the breed's speed and endurance in harness. They were also used as stock horses and for general riding, as well as light driving work. Miners in the California Gold Rush (1848‚Äì1855) used the breed, as did the Army during and after the American Civil War for both riding and harness horses. The Morgan trotting stallion Shepherd F. Knapp was exported to England in the 1860s, where his trotting ability influenced the breeding of Hackney horses. During this period, numerous Morgan mares may have been brought west and integrated into Texan horse herds, which influenced the development of the American Quarter Horse breed. The Morgan horse also was an ancestor of the Missouri Fox Trotter. By the 1870s, however, longer-legged horses came into fashion, and Morgan horses were crossed with those of other breeds. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the original style Morgan, although a few remained in isolated areas. Daniel Chipman Linsley, a native of Middlebury, Vermont, compiled a book of Morgan breeding stallions, published in 1857. Colonel Joseph Battell, also a Middlebury, Vermont native, published the first volume of the Morgan Horse Register in 1894, marking the beginning of a formal breed registry. In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont on land donated by Battell for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed. The breeding program aimed to produce horses that were sound, sturdy, well-mannered, and capable of performing well either under saddle or in harness. In 1951, the Morgan Horse Farm was transferred from the USDA to the Vermont Agricultural College (now the University of Vermont). Military use Morgans were used as cavalry mounts by both sides in the American Civil War. Horses with Morgan roots included Sheridan's Winchester, also known as Rienzi, (a descendant of Black Hawk). Stonewall Jackson's \\"Little Sorrel\\" has alternately been described as a Morgan or an American Saddlebred, a breed heavily influenced by the Morgan. While Morgan enthusiasts have stated that the horse Comanche, the only survivor of the Custer regiment after the Battle of the Little Big Horn, was either a Morgan or a Mustang/Morgan mix, records of the U.S. Army and other early sources do not support this. Most accounts state that Comanche was either of \\"Mustang lineage\\" or a mix of \\"American\\" and \\"Spanish\\" blood. The University of Kansas Natural History Museum, which has the stuffed body of Comanche on display, makes no statement as to his breed. All sources agree that Comanche originated in the Oklahoma or Texas area, making his Mustang background more likely. A young Morgan showing typical breed type Families There are four main bloodlines groups within the Morgan breed today, known as the Brunk, Government, Lippitt, and Western Working \\"families.\\" There are also smaller subfamilies. The Brunk Family, particularly noted for soundness and athleticism, traces to the Illinois breeding program of Joseph Brunk. The Lippitt Family or \\"Lippitts\\" trace to the breeding program of Robert Lippitt Knight, grandson of industrialist Robert Knight and maternal great-great grandson of Revolutionary War officer Christopher Lippitt, founder of the Lippitt Mill. Robert Lippitt Knight focused on preservation breeding of horses descended from Ethan Allen II and this line is considered the \\"purest\\" of the four lines, with the most lines tracing back to Figure and no outcrosses to other breeds in the 20th or 21st centuries. The Government Family is the largest, tracing to Morgans bred by the US Morgan Horse Farm between 1905 and 1951. The foundation sire of this line was General Gates. When USDA involvement ended, the University of Vermont purchased not only the farm, but much of its breeding stock and carries on the program today. The Working Western Family, abbreviated 2WF, have no common breeder or ancestor, but the horses are bred to be stock horses and work cattle, some descended from Government farm stallions shipped west. Organizations A Morgan and rider in saddle seat competition In 1909, the Morgan Horse Club was founded, later changing its name to the American Morgan Horse Association. During the 1930s and 1940s, there was controversy within the registry membership as to whether the stud book should be open or closed; this mirrored similar controversies in other US breed registries. The result of these discussions was that the stud book was declared closed to outside blood as of January 1, 1948. In 1985, the US and Canadian registries signed a reciprocity agreement regarding the registration of horses, and a similar agreement was made between the US and Great Britain registries in 1990. As of 2012, approximately 179,000 horses had been registered over the life of the association, with over 3,000 new foals registered annually. It is estimated that between 175,000 and 180,000 Morgans exist worldwide, and although they are most popular in the United States, there are populations in Great Britain, Sweden and other countries. The American Morgan Horse Association (AMHA) is the largest association for the breed. In addition to the AMHA, since 1996, there has also been a National Morgan Pony Registry, which specializes in horses under . There are several other organizations that focus on specific bloodlines within the Morgan breed. These include the Rainbow Morgan Horse Association, begun in 1990, which works with the AMHA to develop and promote unusually-colored Morgans, such as those with the silver dapple and cream genes. The Foundation Morgan Horse Association registers those horses bred to resemble the stockier type seen in the late 1800s and early 1900s, before crossbreeding with the American Saddlebred became common. Two other membership based organizations, both devoted to preserving the old-time Vermont or \\"Lippitt\\" strain of Morgans, also exist. The first, the Lippitt Club, was started in 1973, and the second, the Lippitt Morgan Breeders Association, was founded in 1995. The Lippitt Morgan Horse Registry, Inc., was formed in 2011. It registers and maintains a dna data base with pedigrees of Lippitt Morgans. There are also associations for Morgans in several countries besides the US, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Sweden, Austria and Germany. In Middlebury, Vermont there is a museum dedicated to the history of the breed. Uses A Morgan horse used for Western riding The Morgan breed is known for its versatility, and is used for a number of English and Western events. They have been successfully shown in many disciplines, including dressage, show jumping, Western pleasure, cutting and endurance riding. They are also used as stock horses and for pleasure riding and driving. They are frequently seen in driving competitions, including combined driving and carriage driving. Morgans were the first American breed to compete in the World Pairs Driving competition, representing the US. They can be seen as mounts for 4-H and Pony Club participants and therapeutic riding programs, due to their gentle disposition and steady movement. There are Morgan-only shows held throughout the US, as well as an \\"open competition\\" program run by the AMHA that gives points based on competition success at all-breed shows. The first annual Grand National and World Championship Morgan Horse Show was held in 1973 in Detroit, Michigan and in 1975 moved to its current home in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Over 1,000 horses compete in the show each year. In 1961, the Morgan horse was named the official state animal of Vermont, and in 1970, the official state horse of Massachusetts. In literature and film A Lippitt Morgan stallion The children's book, Justin Morgan Had a Horse by Marguerite Henry, published in 1945, was a fictional account of Figure and Justin Morgan. It was a Newbery Honor Book in 1946. A movie based on the book was made by Walt Disney Studios in 1972. Both the book and the movie have been criticized for containing a number of historical inaccuracies and for creating or perpetuating some myths about both Justin Morgan and Figure. One equine historian stated, \\"these should be looked upon not as true happenings but as entertainment vehicles.\\" Ellen Feld, a children's author, is also known for her \\"Morgan Horse\\" series. Blackjack: Dreaming of a Morgan Horse, won a Children's Choice Award in 2005, following the 2004 award for its sequel, Frosty: The Adventures of a Morgan Horse. These awards were given by the International Reading Association and the Children‚Äôs Book Council. A Morgan horse is the subject of the poem, The Runaway by Robert Frost. In the poem, the speaker observes \\"A little Morgan\\" colt who has been left out in a mountain pasture during winter and seems to be afraid of the falling snow.

Rockland Junior College, supported by federal funds disbursed through New York State, and sponsored by Nyack High School was established in 1932 as one of several depression-era two-year schools. New York University and Syracuse University accepted two years of credit from the college. Rockland Junior College shut down in 1935. Rockland Community College came eighteen years and later was organized to be an affordable, two-year college in location convenient for county residents; it was planned that it would raise taxes by only $4 a year. At the time, Rockland County, the state's smallest in geographic area outside of New York City, was growing exponentially in population and in demand for a skilled, educated work force. Between 1956 and 1970, Rockland's population was one of the fastest growing in the state, expected to double from 107,000 to 215,000 and the number of high school graduates was projected to rise from 700 to 2,463. Large local industries like Avon Products in Suffern and Lederle Laboratories in Pearl River required more skilled workers, and the growth of hospitals such as Nyack Hospital and Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern warranted the creation of a nursing program. Some 69 percent of parents polled expressed interest in their children attending a community college in Rockland, and 183 high school juniors indicated a strong interest in and an ability to attend a community college in Rockland.

The original property included: *A wooden barn that was converted into a theater and assembly room in the second semester. *Fields leased to local farmers that yielded tomatoes and cabbage. The college later acquired of farmland‚Äî100 to the south from the Hurschle Brothers Farm, and 50 to the west from the Springsteen Farm‚Äîfor its current campus. The barn was used for registration, physical education classes, sports team practices, large classes and final exams, dance classes, student-faculty talent shows, worship services, films, guest lecture series, concert series, even war protest rallies. It also served as the College Barn Theater. The Barn burned in January 1979; in 1983 it was replaced by the Cultural Arts Center. *A \\"potter's field\\" cemetery, the burial grounds for many of the Almshouse residents. Shortly after the college was founded, the county deeded a tract of land in the northern section for establishing a veterans' cemetery, which remains today. *A small square building with barred windows that served as the first Rockland County jail, later the Ramapo town police headquarters, and still later a police radio station.

Personality  The \\"optimist\\" (and, as Beckett put it, \\"the major character\\") of Godot, he represents the intellectual side of the two main characters (in contrast to his companion Estragon's earthy simplicity). One explanation of this intellectualism is that he was once a philosopher. This would explain his constant references and his attempts to engage Estragon in philosophical/religious debate. Vladimir is deeply concerned with appearances and goes to great lengths to make sure Estragon behaves so that his own dignity is preserved. He is something of a pack rat: he carries all the food the tramps have (though he never eats himself), and has other (to quote the play) \\"miscellaneous\\" junk in various pockets. Another important prop is his bowler hat. He claims that it \\"hurts\\" him, and is eventually driven to appropriate Lucky's. After long periods of thought (or whenever he is bored) he fiddles with it and plays with the brim. This hat focus (in terms of being head centred) may be interpreted as being representative of his higher status (see Estragon's boots) and his intellectual nature: because of this, he is usually taller than Estragon, but this is a convention of the theatre and is not written in the play. Despite this sometimes peevish and obsessive nature, Vladimir would seem to have a carnal side. He suffers from a venereal disease that causes him pain in his genitals and a need to urinate when he laughs. This might indicate a sexual past: he refers to a woman he knew who \\"had the clap\\"...although it is unclear whether this is the cause of his current condition or not. An explanation could be that he could represent the 'masculine' i.e. Vlad the Impaler to Estragon's 'feminine' i.e. Estrogen and that instead of waiting to die, it is their division that is preventing them from being born. His hat could represent a prophylactic. Vladimir has the only social conscience in the play (compare Estragon's misanthropic view of humanity: \\"People are bloody ignorant apes!\\"), and it seems that he cares a great deal for the plight of his fellow man: he expresses outrage at Pozzo's treatment of his slave, Lucky, and acts as something of a parental figure to the sometimes childish Estragon. This is not to say Vladimir does not suffer from his own emotional tics. He hates dreams, as they represent a cruel false hope, and he is unable to cope with Estragon's logic, the simplicity of which throws him off. He also does not suffer fools well: Pozzo's decadence and Estragon's crudeness give him much cause for indignation.  The passage of time  Unlike all the other characters, Vladimir has a sense of the passage of time (only he says he remembers the events of Act I, although it is possible Lucky might recall them: see Lucky and Vladimir). However, he considers his memory unreliable because it can never be corroborated, due to Estragon's memory issues. At the end of the play, it is he who realizes the futile cycle that all of them have fallen into (see second quote). However, he rejects this realization when he finds that it is almost unbearable to live with (\\"I can't go on!\\"), and forces himself to dismiss it (\\"What have I said?\\"). He resolves to go on waiting for Godot.  Appearance  Information about his appearance is decidedly scant: he walks in \\"short stiff strides, legs wide apart,\\" and is heavier than Estragon (which gives little information since there is no description of Estragon's weight to use as a reference). It tends to be the convention in most productions, however, that he is tall and lanky, while Estragon is short and squat. He has been portrayed by many notable actors, including Burgess Meredith (with Zero Mostel as Estragon) and - in one rather notorious version of the play - Steve Martin (with Robin Williams as Estragon) and Patrick Stewart.  Relatives  In Tom Stoppard's Godot pastiche, Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, the character Guildenstern closely resembles Vladimir.  Quotations  \\"Hand in hand from the top of the Eiffel Tower, among the first. We were respectable in those days. Now it's too late. They wouldn't even let us up.\\" \\\\---- \\"Was I sleeping, while the others suffered? Am I sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake, or think I do, what shall I say of today? That with Estragon my friend, at this place, until the fall of night, I waited for Godot? That Pozzo passed, with his carrier, and that he spoke to us? Probably. But in all that what truth will there be? (Estragon, having struggled with his boots in vain, is dozing off again. Vladimir looks at him.) He'll know nothing. He'll tell me about the blows he received and I'll give him a carrot.\\" \\\\---- \\"Let us not waste our time in idle discourse! Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. Not indeed that we personally are needed. Others would meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it is too late! Let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned us! What do you say? It is true that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our species. The tiger bounds to the help of his congeners without the least reflection, or else he slinks away into the depths of the thickets. But that is not the question. What are we doing here, that is the question. And we are blessed in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in this immense confusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come‚Äî\\" \\\\---- \\"We wait. We are bored. No, don't protest, we are bored to death, there's no denying it. Good. A diversion comes along and what do we do? We let it go to waste. Come, let's get to work! In an instant all will vanish and we'll be alone once more, in the midst of nothingness!\\" See also *Estragon *Pozzo *Lucky *Waiting for Godot *Antihero Notes \\"When Burt Lahr as Estragon in the American production insisted he was 'top banana' and warned Tom Ewell as Vladimir, 'don't crowd me,' the balance of the play was disturbed.

He was paralyzed at the age of 15 from being in the back of a truck with his friend, when suddenly the pick up truck swerved and hit a tree. He left the bed of the truck from the impact and sustained a spinal cord injury. He worked on rehabilitation, completed high school, then became the first student with a physical disability to graduate in physical education from the University of British Columbia. Hansen won national championships on wheelchair volleyball and wheelchair basketball teams. He went on to become a world class champion wheelchair marathoner and Paralympic athlete. He competed in wheelchair racing at both the 1980 and 1984 Summer Paralympics, winning a total of three gold, two silver, and one bronze medal. Hansen won 19 international wheelchair marathons, including three world championships. He also coached high school basketball and volleyball. Rick had a very close relationship with his family, especially with his father and grandfather, with whom he enjoyed frequent fishing trips. Man in Motion World Tour Upright Hansen's statue, in honour of his Man in Motion World Tour, at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada In 1980, fellow British Columbian and Canadian athlete Terry Fox, who had lost a leg to bone cancer, undertook the Marathon of Hope, intending to run across Canada from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island to raise awareness for cancer research. He made it from St. John's, Newfoundland to Thunder Bay, Ontario, before a cancer recurrence forced him to stop, about half of the way through his journey. Inspired by Terry's courage, Hansen decided to undertake a similar journey to prove the potential of people with disabilities and to inspire a more accessible world. But his planned path was far more ambitious: he planned to circle the world in his wheelchair. In UBC Biomechanics Lab, preparing for tour He embarked on his Man in Motion World Tour on March 21, 1985 from Oakridge Mall in Vancouver. Although public attention was low at the beginning of the tour, he soon attracted international media attention as he progressed on a 26-month trek, logging more than 40,000 km through 34 countries on four continents before crossing Canada. He returned to Vancouver's BC Place Stadium to cheering crowds of thousands on May 22, 1987 after raising $26 million for spinal cord research and quality of life initiatives. Like Terry Fox, he was hailed as an international hero. Today, the wheelchair and many other items associated with the Man in Motion World Tour are preserved by the BC Sports Hall of Fame and Museum. The song \\"St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)\\" was written in his honour by Canadian record producer and composer David Foster and British musician John Parr, and performed by Parr for the soundtrack of the film St. Elmo's Fire. It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in September 1985. Post-tour career Hansen carries the Olympic flame into BC Place Stadium during the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony Hansen speaks to the crowd at the BC Place Stadium during the 2010 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony Hansen is currently president and CEO of the Rick Hansen Foundation, which has generated more than $200 million for spinal cord injury-related programs. Rick Hansen Foundation The Rick Hansen Foundation was established in 1988, following the completion of Rick Hansen's Man in Motion World Tour, to continue raising funds and awareness to create a world without barriers for people with disabilities. For nearly 30 years, the Foundation has been actively improving the lives of people with disabilities, changing perceptions and breaking down barriers. The vision of the organization is to create an inclusive world where people with disabilities can reach their full potential. Through programs, collaboration and leadership, the Foundation has increased awareness and solutions for the barriers people with disabilities face, created more accessible spaces, improved the quality of life and health outcomes for people with spinal cord injuries, mobility issues and other disabilities. In addition, the Foundation operates three major programs. The Rick Hansen School Program is designed for students from grades one to twelve, and teaches inclusiveness, disability awareness and leadership.Rick Hansen Foundation: Rick Hansen School Program Meanwhile, an online accessibility-related travel tool and consumer ratings guide called planat was also launched in 2011.planat.comRick Hansen Foundation: planat The Foundation also provides Quality of Life grants to recipients every year. During 2011 and 2012, the Foundation was also part of a cross-Canada tour called the Rick Hansen 25th Anniversary Relay that followed the same route as Hansen's original Man in Motion Tour, roughly 25 years after it began.Rick Hansen 25th Anniversary Relay Rick Hansen Foundation: 25th Anniversary ICORD, Blusson Spinal Cord Centre and Rick Hansen Institute Rick Hansen in August 2008. Hansen was noted as \\"the driving force\\" in the development of the 48 million dollars raised for the International Collaboration of Repair Discoveries (ICORD), an information network designed to track and record \\"best practices\\" in spinal cord treatment across the country and internationally. ICORD also maintains the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry, allowing doctors and experts across the country to share vital information on what works and what doesn't for specific kinds of spinal cord injuries.Still making a difference: Hansen continues to inspire while raising understanding and money , By Darah Hansen, Vancouver Sun, May 18, 2007. ICORD is located inside the Blusson Spinal Cord Centre, which is also home to the Brenda and David McLean Integrated Spine Clinic, which provides one-stop outpatient care for people with spinal cord injuries or diseases of the spine, as well as the Rick Hansen Institute (formerly the Spinal Cord Injuries Solutions Network). The building was designed to be fully accessible, with no need to display the wheelchair disability sign, and integrates research with care. The province has previously contributed $17.25 million to spinal cord injury research and quality of life ‚Äì $2.25 million to the B.C. Leadership Chair in Spinal Cord Research at the Rick Hansen Institute at UBC and $15 million to the Rick Hansen Foundation in support of its ongoing work to help improve the lives of people with disabilities. Other initiatives Hansen is a supporter of the conservation of sturgeon. Hansen contributed to the Fraser River Sturgeon Conservation Society with the money earned from the book Tale of the Great White Fish. Additionally, he has served as chair for both Fraser River Sturgeon Conservation Society and the Pacific Salmon Endowment Fund Society, helping to restore and protect sturgeon and salmon populations in British Columbia. In 2017, WE Charity and the Rick Hansen Foundation launched a joint venture to advocate for increased accessibility throughout Canada. The initiative was announced as part of WE Day Ottawa, on November 15. The goal of the initiative is to make every building in Canada fully accessible within 30 years. As part of this effort, RHF developed a program to evaluate and promote accessibility across Canada. The program was added to WE Schools curriculum in over 14,500 schools across Canada, the U.S. and the UK. Hansen has made several on stage appearances at WE Day events, speaking in front of thousands of students about overcoming disabilities and inspiring others to be active in their communities. He also helped WE develop ideas for improved accessibility to their Global Learning Centre in Toronto, which was inaugurated during the same year. Hansen earned a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1986 from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Controversies On June 23, 2013, Vancouver Sun columnist David Baines published a lengthy and detailed investigative story about the finances of Hansen and his various foundations and groups. The article, entitled \\"Behind the Rick Hansen Foundation: Charity's Financial Stewardship Questioned\\" reveals, among other things, that \\"in 2009, Hansen donated rights to his name [to the Rick Hansen Foundation] for $1.8 million. In return, he received a $1.8-million tax receipt.\\" It also states that Hansen's salary prior to resigning from his positions as president and CEO in 2011 was \\"more than $400,000 a year; how much more is not clear.\\"Behind the Rick Hansen Foundation: Charity's Financial Stewardship Questioned After his 2011 resignation, he became co-chairman of the foundation (with Lyall Knott) and re-structured his relationship with the foundation by having it create the 'Rick Hansen Leadership Group,' a not-for-profit society that \\"is technically controlled by the foundation but headed by Hansen and includes two assistants\\". That restructuring \\"removed Hansen from the foundation's direct payroll. Instead of paying him directly, the foundation now pays him indirectly through the leadership group\\"; as a consequence, the foundation does not report any compensation level for him in its CRA returns.

It is part of the SUNY system and began in 1953 as Auburn Community College. Its main campus is in Auburn, New York. The college also serves Oswego County with its branch campus in Fulton, New York. The college offers associate degrees and now hosts the University Center, which offers B.A. and B.S. degrees from a number of colleges, on the grounds of CCC. There are 3,775 full-time and part-time students. Degree programs include liberal arts for transfer preparation, computer science, criminal justice, broadcasting, art, nursing, geographic information systems, and education. History The State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees approved the establishment of its first community college on April 9, 1953. Classes began the following year in September at Auburn Community College in the former James Street Elementary School with sixty-nine students. One year later, Cayuga County assumed sponsorship for the college and it changed its name to Cayuga County Community College. Dr. Albert T. Skinner, dean from 1953 to 1955 and president from 1955 until 1978 was instrumental in starting and developing the school from its humble beginnings to the campus where it is now located. Four of its buildings were added during his tenure. Six year after opening, the college moved to its current location to accommodate rising enrollment. The original classroom building remains the main building on campus with other buildings added at later dates: the library (1964), the technology building (1970), the bookstore (1971), Spartan Hall (1980), and the nature center (1983). Later expansions included the opening of the Fulton Campus in 1994. In 2003, the college also opened the Regional Economic Center which housed classrooms for Cayuga students, the offices of several agencies providing employment services to area residents, the new home of the college's NASA-sponsored Institute for the Application of Geospatial Technology, and the college‚Äôs Business and Industry Center, a workforce training complex. Daniel Paul Larson, D.M.A, joined Cayuga as its seventh president in 2007. Six years into his term, in 2013, the college experienced public turmoil when three of the four unions at the college voted no confidence in his leadership. In October of that year, he tendered his resignation, which was accepted by the board effective November 4. Shortly thereafter, the college also declared financial exigency. Dr. Gregory T. DeCinque joined Cayuga Community College as Interim President in December of 2013. Dr. Brian M. Durant joined Cayuga Community College as President in August of 2015. Campus Auburn File:CayugaCountyCommunityCollegeMainEntrance.JPGMain entrance File:KarpinskiRotunda.JPGThe Karpinski Rotunda and the James T. Walsh Regional Economic Center Cayuga Community College is in the Cayuga-Oswego County region. Cayuga consists of a main campus in Auburn, and a second in Fulton. The Auburn Campus has a main structure that consists of 5 main sections referred to as \\"buildings\\". Those sections of the campus when facing the campus are from right to left: Spartan Hall, the Main Building, the Regional Economic Center, the Library Building, and the Tech Building. Cayuga Community College degree programs include health sciences such as Occupational Therapy Assistant programs, media production, art, accounting, education, criminal justice, geographic information systems, and liberal arts. Fulton Located in Fulton NY in Oswego county, Cayuga opened an extension site in the city of Fulton in January 1994. The \\"campus\\" briefly consisted of two rented classrooms in the basement of the Fulton Education Center, until later in the year when classes and offices moved into the former Holy Family School building on West Third Street. In the summer of 2001 the facility on Route 3 opened as Cayuga's Fulton Extension Center. It was expanded in 2004 with additional classroom and office space to meet a dramatic rise in enrollment. In 2006, New York State granted the facility branch campus status, and the \\"Fulton campus\\" designation became official. On July 20, 2011 it was reported in the Syracuse Post Standard that Architectural plans are moving forward for a new Fulton campus. The college‚Äôs Board of Trustees looked over floor plans of the new Fulton campus to be built in the River Glen shopping center. Architect Karin Kilgore-Green said of space in the former P&C; store in Fulton will be converted. A second floor with of space will be built over P&C; site. The college bought the former P&C; Foods building at River Glen Plaza for $950,000 and also is paying $495,000 for of adjoining land. College officials said the purchases were made because CCC needed more space and wanted to own its site. The current facility on Route 481 opened in the summer of 2012 as Cayuga's Fulton campus. At the heart of the campus is the Learning Commons, housing an open computing lab with dozens of computer workstations, a Center for Academic Success, and the Disabilities Services offices. Also located within the Learning Commons is the library, providing continually expanding collections of print and nonprint resources for Fulton faculty and staff, instruction service, laptop computers, online access to all electronic resources, and daily delivery of items from the Auburn collections. The Fulton campus also features 21 general classrooms, distance-learning and video conferencing facilities, five dedicated computer labs, two rooms that could be computer and class rooms, two art rooms, two science labs for biology and chemistry, two conference rooms with the capability for distance learning, library, health suite, offices and student support area with financial aid, bursar and admissions. The Fulton campus also houses business and industry training facilities, a full-service bookstore, and a student lounge. Governance The college is governed by a ten-member Board of Trustees. The Governor appoints four trustees for seven-year terms, five are appointed by the Cayuga County Legislature for seven-year terms, and a student trustee is elected annually and serves for one year. Dr. Gregory T. DeCinque became Cayuga's interim president in 2013. Publications The student newspaper is the Cayuga Collegian. The Auburn/Cayuga Community College Alumni Association publishes the ACC/CCC alumni newsletter every semester.

Based at the Architectural Association in London, the main members of the group were Peter Cook, Warren Chalk, Ron Herron, Dennis Crompton, Michael Webb and David Greene. Designer Theo Crosby was the \\"hidden hand\\" behind the group.Simon Sadler, Archigram: architecture without architecture, MIT Press, 2005, p.161 He gave them coverage in Architectural Design magazine (where he was an editor from 1953‚Äì62), brought them to the attention of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, where, in 1963, they mounted an exhibition called Living City,Crosby raised the money for this from the Gulbenkian Foundation, and subsequently edited its publication in the ICA's Living Arts magazine: Sadler, op cit, p.207 and in 1964 brought them into the Taylor Woodrow Design Group, which he headed, to take on experimental projects.Peter Cook, Archigram, Princeton Architectural Press, 1999, p.44 The pamphlet Archigram I was printed in 1961 to proclaim their ideas. Committed to a 'high tech', light weight, infra-structural approach that was focused towards survival technology, the group experimented with modular technology, mobility through the environment, space capsules and mass-consumer imagery. Their works offered a seductive vision of a glamorous future machine age; however, social and environmental issues were left unaddressed. Archigram agitated to prevent modernism from becoming a sterile and safe orthodoxy by its adherents. Unlike ephemeralisation from Buckminster Fuller which assumes more must be done with less material (because material is finite), Archigram relies on a future of interminable resources. The works of Archigram had a neofuturistic slant being influenced by Antonio Sant'Elia's works. Buckminster Fuller and Yona Friedman were also important sources of inspiration. The works of Archigram served as a source of inspiration for later works such as the High tech 'Pompidou centre' 1971 by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, early Norman Foster works, Gianfranco Franchini and Future Systems. By the early 1970s the strategy of the group had changed. In 1973 Theo Crosby wrotein How to play the environment game, Penguin, p.49 that its members had \\"found their original impulses towards megastructures blunted by the changing intellectual climate in England, where the brash dreams of modern architects are received with ever-increasing horror. They are now more concerned with the infiltration of technology into the environment at a much less obvious level\\". The group was financially supported by mainstream architects, such as David Rock of BDP. Rock later nominated Archigram for the RIBA Royal Gold Medal, which they received in 2002.ARCHIGRAM - RIBA Royal Gold Medalists 2002 Citation by David Rock retrieved 11 April 2007. In 2019, the M+ museum in Hong Kong acquired Archigram's entire archive, despite purported attempts to block the sale to an overseas buyer. Projects Plug-in-City, Peter Cook, 1964 Plug-in-City is a mega-structure with no buildings, just a massive framework into which dwellings in the form of cells or standardised components could be slotted. The machine had taken over and people were the raw material being processed, the difference being that people are meant to enjoy the experience. The Walking City, Ron Herron, 1964 The Walking City is constituted by intelligent buildings or robots that are in the form of giant, self-contained living pods that could roam the cities. The form derived from a combination of insect and machine and was a literal interpretation of le-Corbusier's aphorism of a house as a machine for living in. The pods were independent, yet parasitic as they could 'plug into' way stations to exchange occupants or replenish resources. The citizen is therefore a serviced nomad not totally dissimilar from today's executive cars. The context was perceived as a future ruined world in the aftermath of a nuclear war. Instant City, Peter Cook Instant City is a mobile technological event that drifts into underdeveloped, drab towns via air (balloons) with provisional structures (performance spaces) in tow. The effect is a deliberate overstimulation to produce mass culture, with an embrace of advertising aesthetics. The whole endeavor is intended to eventually move on leaving behind advanced technology hook-ups. Other projects Tuned City, in which Archigram's infrastructural and spatial additions attach themselves to an existing town at a percentage that leaves evidence of the previous development, rather than subsuming the whole. Sixpack France dedicated their Summer Spring 2009 Collection to this movement.

On October 2, President Clinton signed the Proclamation implementing the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA - Title II of the Trade and Development Act of 2000). The Presidential Proclamation declares the 24 current beneficiary countries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) to be \\"Beneficiary Countries\\" for purposes of the enhanced trade preferences made available under the CBTPA. In addition, the Proclamation modifies the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to reflect the new trade preferences. It also delegates to the Office of the United States Trade Representative the authority to publish (through a Federal Register notice) additional determinations regarding the compliance of CBTPA Beneficiary Countries with customs-related procedures established in the CBTPA. Summary of Enhanced CBTPA Preferences The CBTPA significantly expands preferential treatment for apparel made in the Caribbean Basin region. Duty- and quota-free treatment is provided for apparel made in the CBI from U.S. fabrics formed from U.S. yarns. Duty/quota-free treatment is also available for certain knit apparel made in CBTPA beneficiary countries from fabrics formed in the Caribbean Basin region, provided that U.S. yarns are used in forming the fabric. This \\"regional fabric\\" benefit for knit apparel is subject to an overall yearly limit, with a separate limit provided for T-shirts. New duty/quota free treatment will also be available for apparel made in the CBI from fabrics determined to be in \\"short supply\\" in the United States, and for designated \\"hand-loomed, handmade, or folklore\\" articles. In addition to these apparel preferences, the CBTPA provides NAFTA-equivalent tariff treatment for certain items previously excluded from duty-free treatment under the CBI program (e.g., footwear, canned tuna, petroleum products, watches and watch parts). Beneficiary Country Designation The CBTPA authorized the President to designate individual countries as being \\"Beneficiary Countries\\" in order to receive the enhanced trade benefits available under the Act. The twenty-four current beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) were potentially eligible to be declared CBTPA Beneficiary Countries. These countries are: Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and British Virgin Islands. Through the Proclamation issued today, President Clinton designated all 24 countries as CBTPA Beneficiary Countries. Eligibility Review Factors In considering the eligibility of these countries for CBTPA Beneficiary Country status, the CBTPA required the President to take into account the existing eligibility criteria of the CBERA, as well as several new criteria elaborated in the CBTPA. These new criteria include: # Whether the beneficiary country has demonstrated a commitment to undertake its obligations under the WTO on or ahead of schedule and participate in negotiations toward the completion of the FTAA or another free trade agreement. # The extent to which the country provides protection of intellectual property rights consistent with or greater than the protection afforded under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. # The extent to which the country provides internationally recognized worker's rights, including: ## the right of association; ## the right to organize and bargain collectively; ## a prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor; ## a minimum age for the employment of children; and ## acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health; # Whether the country has implemented its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. # The extent to which the country has met U.S. counter-narcotics certification criteria under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. # The extent to which the country has taken steps to become a party to and implements the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption. # The extent to which the country applied transparent, nondiscriminatory and competitive procedures in government procurement, and contribute to efforts in international for to develop an implement rules on transparency in government procurement. Customs-Related Eligibility Determination In addition to Presidential eligibility designations based on the criteria described above, the CBTPA requires an additional determination that countries have implemented or are making substantial progress towards implementing certain customs procedures based on those contained in the NAFTA. Today's Proclamation delegates authority for these additional determinations to USTR. USTR will publish initial determinations on this eligibility criteria in coming days, through a notice in the Federal Register. Eligibility Review Process The USTR-chaired Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) conducted a review of countries' eligibility for CBTPA preferences, taking into account the criteria established in the Act. This review relied upon information provided by U.S. Embassies, keyed to the various eligibility criteria, as well as on information from other reliable sources, such as the International Labour Organization. In addition, the TPSC took into account public comments regarding the eligibility review, solicited through a Federal Register notice published June 19, 2000. The TPSC received 206 comments in response to this notice. Through a series of meetings, the TPSC identified a number of concerns regarding certain countries' performance with respect to the eligibility criteria established in the CBTPA. For each of these areas of concern, the TPSC further identified specific policy objectives to be pursued with the relevant governments, with the general aim of soliciting assurances that these concerns would be addressed. For those countries for which concerns and objectives had been identified, U.S. Embassy officials in the Caribbean Basin region and other U.S. government officials conducted intensive advocacy with local government officials. TPSC recommendations to the President regarding the designation of CBTPA Beneficiary Countries were based on the results of these efforts. The eligibility review process involved direct, issue-specific advocacy with a majority of the countries that were potentially eligible for CBTPA benefits. Objectives with respect to intellectual property protection, worker rights, implementation of WTO agreements, and commitments to abide by international anti-corruption guidelines were pursued with a range of countries. The review concluded that CBI countries satisfied the CBTPA criteria regarding commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor; however, several countries were urged to expand upon their current efforts to combat all forms of child labor. Guatemala: Additional Review of Worker Rights Issues The review of Guatemala's eligibility for the enhanced CBI preferences involved extensive consideration of the worker rights situation in that country. The United States raised specific concerns with respect to anti-union violence, including a 1999 incident in which armed vigilantes threatened and kidnapped leaders of a banana workers' union who were protesting the illegal dismissal of 900 workers. Guatemala was asked to facilitate negotiations to reemploy the 900 fired workers and to commit to speedy and effective implementation of labor code requirements with respect to this case. Guatemala's government was also asked to work with the country's legislature to pass proposed revisions to the labor code, and to provide a commitment, over the longer-term, to continual improvements in law enforcement and judicial administration related to the protection of worker rights. In their responses to U.S. concerns, Guatemala's Vice President, Minister of Labor, and other officials have demonstrated considerable good faith in seeking to improve the worker rights situation in their country. The United States welcomes the Ministry of Labor's efforts to date to facilitate a resolution to the situation arising from the 1999 incident involving banana workers. There is evidence of progress in prosecuting those responsible for violence against workers in that case. We also welcome efforts by the government to suspend operating licenses of companies which have violated labor code provisions. In addition, the Guatemalan executive branch has presented legislation to bring the country's labor laws into conformity with ILO recommendations. It is on the basis of these actions and assurances that Guatemala has been designated at this time as a CBTPA Beneficiary Country. Despite certain forthcoming actions and statements by Guatemalan officials, the United States remains deeply concerned that the overall worker rights environment in Guatemala represents a threat to those seeking to advance basic, internationally recognized rights for workers. Instances of anti-union violence, including occasional murders, persist. The widespread impunity for those who provoke and carry out such violence is a particularly severe concern. Consequently, Guatemala's CBTPA beneficiary status will be reviewed in April 2001, with a focus on further improvements in the area of worker rights. This review will include the following objectives: a) an assessment that the Guatemalan executive branch is taking all actions within its authority to ensure the physical safety and human and civil rights of union leaders and the effective criminal prosecution of persons charged with provoking anti-union violence, including killings of union leaders; b) assurances that the Government of Guatemala is taking all steps within its power to provide for the re-employment of the 900 fired banana workers and settlement of related labor law violations; c) further progress towards enacting the new Labor Code; and d) further improvements in labor law enforcement and judicial administration related to the protection of labor rights. As a further sign of the seriousness with which the United States views these issues, Ambassador Barshefsky is initiating immediately a review of Guatemala's eligibility as a beneficiary country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). This unprecedented self-initiated review will also be concluded in April 2001, and will focus on the government's response to anti-union violence and other aspects of internationally recognized worker rights. Worker Rights Monitoring in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua Worker rights issues were also pursued in the context of the CBTPA eligibility review of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. With respect to El Salvador, the United States raised concerns regarding the effect of certain privatization programs in restricting union activity, as well as excessive legal formalities applied to the establishment of trade unions. In Honduras, the United States focused on the government's efforts to revise the Honduran labor code to reflect recommendations made by the International Labour Organization. In Nicaragua, the U.S. expressed particular concern with respect to anti-union activity at two apparel factories in the Las Mercedes Free Trade Zone, and successfully sought the government's assurances that workers at those factories would be informed of their rights under Nicaragua's Labor Code. In each of these cases, the governments in question provided responses which were helpful in addressing U.S. concerns. Nonetheless, the Administration believes that worker rights practices in these countries should be subject to ongoing monitoring. This monitoring will focus on follow-through to the commitments made by these governments in the context of the CBTPA eligibility review. In addition, the United States will request bilateral consultations with each of the three governments to discuss worker rights concerns by June 30, 2001.

Although the candidate has little chance of winning, a major party will normally make an effort to ensure it has its name on the ballot paper in every constituency. In two-party systems, a paper candidate may also be known as token opposition. A dummy candidate is similar to a paper candidate in that both types do not intend to win their race; however, they differ in that a dummy candidate typically has an ulterior motive for being in the race, such as to dishonestly divert votes away from more legitimate candidates or to take advantage of benefits afforded to political candidates. Another related concept is the stalking horse candidate, a junior or little-known politician who challenges an incumbent to test the support for a more serious challenge from someone else.  United States  Paper candidates may be local party members, or members from neighbouring areas or from central office depending on the laws of the jurisdiction (most U.S. states, for example, require all candidates for state and local office to reside in the district they intend on representing for a certain length of time). The main purpose of fielding paper candidates is to maintain or improve the profile of a political party and, in two-party systems, to provide at least nominal opposition to a seemingly unassailable incumbent. Another potential use for paper candidacy is to allow a candidate who wants off the ballot of another race to do so by running for something else, a race they cannot possibly win (such as Rick Lazio, who lost a Republican primary for New York Governor in 2010 but still had a third-party ballot line; in order to disqualify himself from the gubernatorial election Lazio was nominated for a judicial seat in the Bronx that was so heavily Democratic that he could not have possibly won if he wanted to, and he did not).Paybarah, Azi (28 September 2010). Judge Lazio. WNYC. Retrieved 18 May 2014. The paper candidates themselves typically do little or no campaigning and neither incur nor claim any expenses. There are circumstances where a paper candidate can win election, often when the opposing candidate is unexpectedly embroiled in scandal; for example, then-27-year-old American Chris Smith, who ran as a token opponent to New Jersey congressman Frank Thompson in 1978 and 1980, won the latter contest after Thompson was embroiled in the Abscam scandal.Gruson, Lindsey (10 August 1991). \\"Decade of Rep. Smith: Fluke to Tactician\\", The New York Times, 10 August 1991. Accessed 28 March 2008. \\"He switched parties but lost in 1978 as the token opposition to Frank Thompson, a veteran Democrat who was chairman of the House Administration Committee. But he won in 1980, when Mr. Thompson was convicted of bribery and conspiracy in the Abscam scandal and later served two years in prison.\\" Another example is Michael Patrick Flanagan, a little-known Republican attorney who defeated longtime Democratic incumbent Dan Rostenkowski, the powerful Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, in a heavily Democratic Chicago-based district after Rostenkowski was indicted on charges of mail fraud. The victory occurred in 1994 as part of a national Republican wave. In jurisdictions with strict campaign finance and spending laws governing elections, it is often a legal necessity to run the maximum number candidates permitted (or close thereto) in order to spend the maximum amount of money otherwise permitted by law. In such cases, parties will run paper candidates, but will usually endeavour to use the extra spending allowance afforded (at least to the extent that it may be permitted in the jurisdiction) to campaign in districts where they have a realistic chance of winning.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, major parties often find it difficult to field a full list of candidates for all council seats up for election, especially in the case of councils with \\"all-up\\" elections. Parties find it desirable to persuade people to stand as paper candidates so that: * Supporters have an opportunity to vote for the party * The total vote obtained across the council and the nation is maximised * All seats are contested so there is no risk that candidates from other parties can be declared elected unopposed In Britain, being nominated as a local election candidate simply involves signing some forms, with no deposit required. A paper candidate will often do no campaigning at all and so be able to submit a zero return of election expenses, simplifying the paperwork for the election agent. Paper candidates are commonly fielded in different locations by all the major parties in both local and national elections. Some paper candidates stand in order to help their party but do not wish to be elected to the post in question. In fact, some paper candidates only agree to stand after receiving assurances that there is no \\"risk\\" of them getting elected. Following the Scottish National Party's landslide in Scotland in the 2015 general election, when they went from 6 to 56 seats (out of 59 Scottish seats), it was reported that some candidates were so surprised at winning they considered resigning immediately after the election. In the 2019 general election, some Conservative candidates were selected just weeks prior to the election and won seats in the Labour \\"red wall\\" in northern England and Wales, which were previously considered unwinnable by the party. One main disadvantage to fielding paper candidates in an electoral system like the UK's is that unsavoury details about one candidate's past tend to be more damaging to a party's image across the country, no matter what that candidate's chances of election actually are. Therefore, paper candidates for major parties in Britain are almost as heavily vetted as candidates who are expected to win their seats. In Belfast North at the 2017 election, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) were criticised for standing Martin McAuley as a \\"paper candidate\\" ‚Äî a deliberately weak candidate, a 26-year-old with little experience, on the assumption that nationalist and Catholic voters would instead vote for Sinn F√©in, instead of the unionist candidate Nigel Dodds (DUP]). McAuley rejected the label of \\"paper candidate\\" Dodds narrowly won the election. In 2019, the SDLP did not field a candidate in Belfast North and Sinn F√©in won the seat. The SDLP were also accused of standing a \\"paper candidate,\\" Mary Garrity, in Fermanagh and South Tyrone in 2017, in order to help Sinn F√©in win the seat from the UUP. Republic of Ireland In the Republic of Ireland, the single transferable vote system is used, so paper candidates are less common and more seats are up for grabs. However, there have been cases of unexpected surges for certain parties (such as Labour in 1992 and Sinn F√©in in 2020) that led to many paper candidates being unexpectedly elected. This was epitomised in 1992 with Moosajee Bhamjee, Ireland's first Indian and first Muslim TD, who only stood in Clare because no one else in the local Labour party wanted to. In 2020, many inexperienced Sinn F√©in candidates won, such as Claire Kerrane (Roscommon‚ÄìGalway) and Violet-Anne Wynne (Clare), both of whom had never held an elected office before and were the first Sinn F√©in TDs in those counties since the 1920s. On the other hand, the success of the Social Democrats in the 2020 election was attributed to their lack of paper candidates: they fielded candidates in just 20 out of 39 constituencies and won 6 TDs.  Canada  In Canada, paper candidates may exist at both the federal and provincial / territorial levels. As in Great Britain, they most commonly exist to allow the main political parties to field candidates in as many constituencies as possible. From 2004 to 2011, parties at the federal level had a financial incentive to draw as many votes as possible due to a per-vote subsidy, paid to all parties with at least 2% of the total popular vote regardless of the number of seats actually won. This subsidy, enacted under the Liberal Party, was fully phased out in 2015 under the Conservative Party. Nevertheless, even in the absence of per-vote subsidies, parties have other strong incentives to maximize their overall popular vote. In particular, even though winning the popular vote in itself conveys no special rights or privileges in the Canadian electoral system, there have been multiple instances (especially at the provincial level) where a party that has won the popular vote but not a plurality of seats has attempted to claim a mandate to govern, often using its popular vote victory to justify such claims. Political parties therefore have an incentive to ensure at all costs that the entire electorate at least has the ability to vote for them. Paper candidates are sometimes used if the party is not seriously contesting the election but must run candidates so it can either get registered or stay registered for some other purpose. In such cases, paper candidates will usually run in districts which ideologically- like-minded parties are seen to have little chance of winning, so as to minimize the risk of any nominal support they might receive proving to be the decisive margin in a close local election under the country's first past the post electoral system. An example of this scenario in action was found in Saskatchewan, where the Progressive Conservative Party withdrew from public presence in the late 1990s but continued to run at least ten candidates, all in urban ridings where the then-governing Saskatchewan New Democratic Party was dominant at the time, in the province's general elections until the relevant law was amended so as to keep its registration with Elections Saskatchewan, largely to avoid losing control of what at the time was believed to be a substantial amount of money. The Progressive Conservative Party has since attempted to \\"revive\\" itself and no longer considers its nominees to be paper candidates. However, they have only achieved modest levels of support with candidates affiliated with the national Conservative Party typically running under the banner of the Progressive Conservative Party in provincial elections. In neighbouring Alberta, The United Conservative Party formed from a \\"merger\\" of the Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties. However, as Albertan electoral law did not permit the parties to officially merge, both parties continue to exist on paper under the UCP leadership team. Albertan electoral law only requires a party to nominate a single candidate to maintain its registration, so both ran a candidate in the riding held by the incumbent New Democratic premier which is widely seen to be the NDP's safest seat. Due to the \\"merger\\", the PC candidate polled enough votes to finish fourth place, ahead of candidates for parties running \\"serious\\" campaigns such as the Alberta Liberal Party. Paper candidates in Quebec (\\"poteau\\" in Canadian French, a term meaning that the candidate will only be seen on poles), particularly of the name-on-ballot variety, can sometimes provide unwanted attention for the candidate's party, particularly if they become viable prospects for elections. For example, in the 2011 federal election, a sudden increase in opinion-poll support, particularly in Quebec, for the New Democratic Party ‚Äì which historically had a minimal presence in that province ‚Äì led to greater scrutiny of some of that party's lower-profile Quebec candidates ‚Äî one of whom, Ruth Ellen Brosseau who was working as a bartender hundreds of kilometres away from the riding, won even though she had never been in her riding, and spoke its dominant language poorly. However, Brosseau successfully shook off the label by the time of the 2015 election, having become recognized as a hard-working MP who had built a significant base of popularity in her district.Graeme Hamilton, \\"NDP MP, elected in 2011 without any campaigning, now popular in her adopted Quebec riding\\". National Post, 17 August 2015. She was defeated in the 2019 election. The Progressive Conservative Party also had a number of paper candidates who won election in the party's historic landslide victory in the 1984 election, such as Thomas Suluk. An extreme version of a paper candidate, is a \\"Name on Ballot\\", often referred to by the acronym \\"NoB\\". Many NoBs (Name on Ballots') will only place campaign signs, and even then, a minority do not campaign at all. In most cases, the only requirement is that the candidate show up at the returning officer's headquarters for a few moments to take an oath and pay the required nomination deposit. However, a more extreme example is that of Alberta, where candidates do not need to show up to talk to a returning officer, as long as someone on behalf of the party drops off the required paperwork and funds. In many smaller parties, a majority of the party's candidates in any given election, such as the Prince Edward Island New Democrats, are NoBs. The term is often worn as a badge of pride in one's loyalty to the party. PEI New Democrat, Dr. Bob Perry, who has been a NoB (Name on Ballot) many times in the past, often calls himself \\"Dr. NoB\\" at election time.

A Union military officer, Bristow was a Republican Party reformer and civil rights advocate. During his tenure as Secretary of Treasury, he is primarily known for breaking up and prosecuting the Whiskey Ring, a corrupt tax evasion profiteering ring that depleted the national treasury at the behest of President Grant. Additionally, Bristow promoted gold standard currency rather than paper. Bristow was one of Grant's most popular Cabinet members among reformers. Bristow supported Grant's Resumption of Specie Act of 1875, that helped stabilize the economy during the Panic of 1873. As the United States' first solicitor general, Bristow aided President Ulysses S. Grant and Attorney General Amos T. Akerman's vigorous and thorough prosecution and destruction of the Ku Klux Klan in the Reconstructed South.Department of Justice, Benjamin Bristow Solicitor General Bristow advocated African American citizens in Kentucky be allowed to testify in a white man's court case and that education was for all races to be paid for by public funding. A native of Kentucky, Bristow was the son of a prominent Whig Unionist and attorney. Having graduated Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1851, Bristow studied law and passed the bar in 1853, working as an attorney until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Fighting for the Union, Bristow served in the army during the American Civil War and was promoted to colonel. Wounded at the Battle of Shiloh, Bristow recuperated and would be promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1863, Bristow was elected Kentucky state Senator, serving only one term. At the end of the Civil War, Bristow was appointed assistant to the U.S. District Attorney serving in the Louisville area, In 1866, Bristow was appointed U.S. District attorney serving in the Louisville area. In 1870, Bristow was appointed the United States' first U.S. Solicitor General, who aided the U.S. Attorney General by arguing cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1874, Bristow was appointed U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by President Ulysses S. Grant. Initially Grant gave Bristow his full support during Bristow's popular prosecution of the Whiskey Ring. However, when Bristow and Grant's Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont, another reforming Cabinet member, uncovered that Orville Babcock, Grant's personal secretary, was involved in the ring, Grant's relationship with Bristow cooled. In June 1876, due to friction over Bristow's zealous prosecution of the Whiskey Ring and rumor that Bristow was interested in running for the U.S. Presidency, Bristow resigned from President Grant's Cabinet. During the presidential election of 1876, Bristow made an unsuccessful attempt at gaining the Republican presidential ticket, running as a Republican reformer; the Republicans, however, chose Rutherford B. Hayes. After the 1876 presidential election, Bristow returned to private practice in New York, forming a successful law practice in 1878, often arguing cases before the U.S. Supreme Court until his death in 1896. Bristow was credited, by historian Jean Edward Smith, one of Grant's best cabinet choices. Reformers were generally pleased by Secretary Bristow's overall prosecution of the Whiskey Ring, and looked to him for cleaning up government corruption. Historians have also given credit for Bristow, America's first Solictor General, for prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan. Bristow, however, had an ambitious, contentious nature, and at times this led to various feuds with Grant cabinet members. Bristow, a native of Kentucky, represented the South on Grant's cabinet, during Grant's second term. Early life Edwards Hall Benjamin Helm Bristow was born in Edwards Hall on June 20, 1832 in Elkton, Kentucky.Boone, George Street. '. National Park Service, 1973-07-10, 3. Bristow was the son of Francis M. Bristow and his wife Emily Helm. This work in turn cites: * Willcox, David, Memorial of Benjamin Helm Bristow, Cambridge, Mass., privately printed, 1897. * Whiskey Frauds, 44th Congress, 1st Session, Mis. Doc. No. 186. * McDonald, John, Secrets of the Great Whiskey Ring, Chicago, 1880. A book by one concerned and to be considered in that light: John McDonald was supervisor of internal revenue at St Louis for nearly six years. Francis was a prominent lawyer and Whig member of Congress in 1854‚Äì1855 and 1859‚Äì1861. Edwards Hall was the home of his late grandfather, Benjamin Edwards. Bristow graduated at Jefferson College, Washington, Pennsylvania, in 1851, studied law under his father, and was admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1853. For a while Bristow worked as a law partner for his father. His father later became a strong anti-slavery Unionist. His father's political anti-slavery and Whig views strongly influenced Bristow's own political outlook. Marriage and family On November 21, 1854, Bristow married Abbie S. Briscoe. Benjamin and Abbie had two children one son, William A. Bristow, and one daughter Nannie Bristow. William was an attorney who worked in Bristow's New York law firm Bristow, Opdyke, & Willcox. In June 1896 William was in London recovering from typhoid fever. Nannie married Eben S. Sumner a Massachusetts textile businessman and politician. Kentucky law practice (1858-1861) In 1858, Bristow and his wife Abbie moved to Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Bristow practiced law until the outbreak of the Civil War. American Civil War (1861-1863) Battle of Shiloh In December 1860, after Abraham Lincoln was elected, the South seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy (1861), primarily to protect the institution of slavery, profitable cotton plantations, and resistance to black integration and citizenship.Chadwick, French Esnor. Causes of the civil war, 1859‚Äì1861 (1906) p. 8 President James Buchanan, sympathetic to the South, did virtually nothing to contain Southern secession, prior to Lincoln's March 4, 1861 Inauguration. At the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, Bristow, an ardent Unionist, joined the Union Army, and mustered the 25th Kentucky Infantry . On September 21, 1861, Bristow was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 25th Kentucky Infantry. Bristow fought under General Ulysses S. Grant and served bravely at three battles, Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, and Shiloh, at the latter he was injured. In April 1862, General Grant and most of his Union Army were encamped at Pittsburg Landing, and had planned to attack Corinth, a Confederate stronghold. The Confederates, however attacked in full force, that surprised Grant's unentrenched Union Army. Grant and his men were able to hold off the Confederate Army, although one Union division was captured. The next day, after Grant received reinforcements, the Union Army attacked the Confederates in full force and pushed the Southern Army back to Corinth. At this two day Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, Bristow was severely wounded by an exploding shell over his head and temporarily forced to retire from field duty in order to recover from his injury. The force and noise of the explosion left Bristow deaf and unconscious, unable to command. Bristow was replaced by Major William B. Wall. After his recuperation, Bristow returned to field service during the summer of 1862 and helped recruit the 8th Kentucky Cavalry. On September 8, 1862 Bristow was commissioned lieutenant colonel over the 8th Kentucky Cavalry. Bristow assumed command of the 8th Kentucky Cavalry in January, 1863 after Col. James M. Shackleford, the previous commander, was promoted brigadier general. On April 1, 1863 Bristow was promoted to colonel and continued his command over the 8th Kentucky Cavalry. In July, 1863 Col. Bristow and the Kentucky 8th Cavalry assisted in the capture of John Hunt Morgan during his July 1863 raid through Indiana and Ohio. Kentucky state senator (1863-1865) On September 23, 1863, Bristow was honorably discharged from service in the Union Army; having been elected Kentucky State Senator by Christian County. Bristow had not known he had been elected and served one term as State Senator until 1865, having resigned office. Bristow supported all Union war effort legislation, the presidential election of Abraham Lincoln in 1864, and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment that outlawed slavery. U.S. District Attorney (1866-1870)  In 1865, Bristow was appointed assistant to the United States Attorney. In 1866, Bristow was appointed district attorney for the Louisville, Kentucky district. As district attorney, he was renowned for his vigor in enforcing the 1866 U.S. Civil Rights Act. Bristow served as district attorney until 1870 and spent a few months practicing law in partnership with future United States Supreme Court Justice John Harlan. First U.S. Solicitor General (1870-1872) Prosecuted Ku Klux Klan Bristow, America's first Solicitor General, federally prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan 1871 In 1870, Congress created the U.S. Department of Justice, in part, to aid in the enforcement of U.S. Congressional Reconstruction laws and U.S. Constitutional amendments. On October 4, 1870, Bristow was appointed the first incumbent U.S. Solicitor General by President Ulysses S. Grant and served until November 12, 1872, having resigned the office. Bristow and U.S. Attorney General Amos Akerman prosecuted thousands of Klansmen that resulted in a brief two-year quiet period during the turbulent Reconstruction Era in the South. In 1873 President Grant nominated him Attorney General of the United States in case then Attorney General George H. Williams was confirmed as Chief Justice of the United States, a contingency which did not arise. Feud with Akerman On the verge of prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan in mid-September 1871, Bristow in Washington launched a treacherous attack on his boss Akerman's reputation, while Akerman was fighting lawlessness in the South. After Grant returned from a trip to Dayton, Ohio, Bristow, wanting Akerman's cabinet post, told Grant that Akerman was \\"to small\\" for the job of Attorney General and he was not respected \\"by the Court & the profession generally\\". Bristow went so far as to call Akerman a \\"dead weight on the administration\\". Grant was shocked at Bristow's view of Akerman and surprised that Bristow had prodded Grant to get him fired by Grant. Grant refused to consider firing Akerman, telling Bristow that Akerman was thoroughly honest and an earnest man. Grant kept Akerman on the cabinet while Bristow retained his job of Solicitor General. Civil rights speech In 1871, Bristow traveled to his native Kentucky state and in a speech advocated African American civil rights. Bristow advocated that blacks be given the right to testify in juries. At this time Kentucky law forbade the 225,000 black U.S. citizens from testifying in any civil or criminal case involving a white man. He stated the Kentucky law that denied African Americans the right to testify in a white man's case had roots in slavery and was a \\"monstrous and grievous wrong to both races.\\" Bristow stated that the Ku Klux Klan Act and the previous Civil Rights acts passed by the U.S. Congress were designed to protect the \\"humblest citizens\\" from lawbreakers. Bristow stated he would \\"tax the rich man's property to educate his poor neighbor's child\\", and he would \\"tax the white man's property to educate the black man's child.\\" Bristow advocated free universal education and all property in Kentucky be taxed to pay for schools.New York Times (June 16, 1876), Nomination of Benjamin H. Bristow Secretary of the Treasury (1874-1876) Benjamin Bristow Secretary of Treasury Bureau of Engraving and Printing On June 3, 1874 President Grant appointed Bristow Secretary of the Treasury after William A. Richardson was removed in light of the Sanborn incident that involved Treasury contract scandals. Bristow was hailed by the press as a much needed reformer. Bristow took control of the Treasury during the Long Depression, that was started by the Panic of 1873. The Republican Party at this time was divided over currency. Bristow supported the hard money North Eastern Republicans and favored a resumption of species (coin money) to replace greenbacks (paper money). President Grant had vetoed the Inflation Bill, on April 22, that would have increased paper money into the collapsed economy. Bristow's support of Grant's veto helped him get nominated for the Treasury by Grant. Sixteen days after Bristow took office, on June 20, Grant signed a compromise act that legalized $26 million greenbacks released by previous Treasury Secretary Richardson, allowed a maximum of $382 million greenbacks, and authorized a redistribution of $55 million national banknotes. The act had little affect to alleve the devastated economy. Internal reforms made Fulfilling the press's reformer expectation, Bristow immediately went to work. He drastically reorganized the Treasury Department, abolished the corrupt office of supervising architect made famous by Alfred B. Mullett, and dismissed the second-comptroller and his subordinates for inefficiency. Bristow shook up the detective force and consolidated collection districts in the Customs and Internal Revenue Services. He dismissed over 700 people and implemented civil service rules in the Treasury Department. Feud with Robeson Within a few months after Grant appointed Bristow to run the Treasury, Bristow developed a feud with Grant's appointed Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson. The controversy centered around Robeson wanting to have Senator A.G. Cattell appointed financial agent in London to negotiate a bond issue. Cattell had performed a similar service in 1873 under previous Secretary Richardson. Bristow refused to make the appointment and believed a Treasury appointee could do the job. Bristow lobbied Grant to appoint John Bigelow, head of the Treasury Department's Loan Division. Grant accepted Bristow's choice of Bigelow, but he warned Bristow that Bigelow had a previous episode of drunkness. Bristow went further to undercut Robeson's influence in the Grant cabinet. Bristow told Grant that Robeson's Navy Department was financially mismanaged, and was under the control of former treasury secretary Hugh McCulloch's banking house. Bristow's advisers told Bristow to cool things off, and take a less confrontational approach. Feud with Williams Grant's appointed Attorney General George Williams position on the cabinet was not secure, after Williams nomination was withdrawn by Grant for Supreme Court Justice. His personal reputation and that of his wife, Kate Williams, was under public scrutiny. To defend her husband and herself, Kate sent out anonymous letters to slander Grant's cabinet, and others, including alleging sexual misconduct. Cabinet members who had received letters included Secretary of War William Belknap and Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson. Treasury department solicitor, Bluford Wilson, hired H.C. Whitely to investigate Kate and the letters. Wilson, Belknap, and Robeson agreed that Williams had to go. Bristow, supporting Wilson, urged Grant to fire Williams. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish told Grant that Kate had received a bribe of $30,000 from Pratt & Boyd for the Justice Department to drop a case against the company. Grant finally fired Williams, and replaced him with New York reformer Edwards Pierrepont, who cleaned up the Department of Justice. Feud with Delano Columbus Delano Bristow called Delano a \\"very mean dog\\". Columbus Delano was Grant's Secretary of Interior, who allowed corruption in the vast Interior Department. Bristow, a reformer, wanted Delano out of office, believing Delano's departure would establish integrity in the Republican Party. Also, Bristow believed Delano was plotting to remove Bristow from the Interior. Bristow called Delano a \\"very mean dog\\" and said Delano deserved the \\"execration of every honest man.\\" Bristow hired Frank Wolcott to investigate Delano's department, that was ripe with corruption. Wolcott discovered that surveyor general of Wyoming, Silas Reed, had been making contracts with corrupt surveyors who shared enormous profits with silent-partners. One of those silent-partners was Delano's son John, who had no survey training or work experience. Wolcott sent Bristow damaging evidence against Delano, while Bristow shrewdly turned the documents over to Grant. Although the silent-partner contracts were technically legal, the scandal would embolden the Democrats. By April 1875, Delano had to go, but Grant delayed his resignation for several months. Delano fought back, by revealing information that other cabinet officers wanted Delano to stay in office, in addition to having made a false charge against Bristow. In October 1875, Grant finally replaced Delano with reformer Zachariah Chandler, who cleaned up corruption the Interior Department. Broke the Whiskey Ring  In the Spring of 1875, Bristow began an anti-corruption campaign that would put him in the national spotlight. Bristow's greatest work in the Treasury Department came in prosecution and break up of the notorious Whiskey Ring headquartered in St. Louis The Whiskey Ring was powerful and corrupt machine started by western distillers and their allies in the Internal Revenue Service; it profiteered by evading the collection of taxes on whiskey production. Distillers tended to bribe revenue agents, rather than pay excessive levies on alcohol. Past efforts to uncover the Whiskey Ring were unsuccessful, because ring members in Washington D.C. alerted other ring members of pending investigations. A November 1872 investigation, by three revenue investigators, into St. Louis distilleries, had found significant irregularities, but one agent who was bribed, submitted a whitewashed version of corruption. Despite Washington rumors of its existence, the ring seemed to be impregnable to prosecution. =Investigation= In the Fall of 1874 Bristow received a $125,000 appropriation from Congress to investigate the Whiskey Ring. In December 1874, Bristow convinced Internal Revenue Supervisor J.W. Douglas to send a new investigation team, but Grant's private Secretary at the White House, Orville E. Babcock, convinced Douglas to revoke his order. An effort to transfer revenue supervisors, proposed by Douglas, to new locations, to dismantle the ring, was defeated when, out of political objection, Grant suspended the order on February 4, 1875. Grant desired to \\"detect frauds\\" that had already been committed by the Whiskey Ring, rather than transfer the supervisors. Bristow, and Grant appointed Treasury Solicitor Bluford Wilson, lost faith in Douglas' willingness to go after the ring, and launched a covert investigation by independent undercover investigators, suggested by revenue agent Homer Yaryan. Probe Away ! Thomas Nast Harper's Weekly, March 1876 Political journalist, George W. Fishback, owner of the St. Louis Democrat advised Bristow and Wilson, on how to expose the ring and to bypass any corrupt federal appointees who would tip other ring partners of a federal investigation. Washington correspondent, Henry V. Boynton, also aided Bristow and Wilson in their investigation. Monitored by Wilson, incorruptible investigative agents, that included Yaryan, obtained a vast supply of evidence in St. Louis of frauds committed by the ring. Bristow, in order to secure the enormity of the Whiskey Ring corruption, audited railroad and steamboat cargo receipts for accurate figures of the shipment of liquor in St. Louis and other key cities. To keep the investigation secret from the ring, Bristow gave the agents a cipher different from the Treasury code, while messages were relayed through Fishback and Boynton. Similar investigative work was done in Chicago and Milwaukee. Evidence of fraudulent activity was quickly obtained, into a profiteering scheme, that involved corrupt distillers and revenue agents. To escape taxes, the Whiskey Ring shipped whiskey labelled vinegar, listed whiskey at a lower proof, or illegally used revenue stamps multiple times. As a result, millions of dollars were depleted from the treasury in tax revenues. Bristow's investigation revealed that Grant appointment, General John McDonald, St. Louis Collector of Internal Revenue, who controlled seven states, was the ring leader. In April 1875, McDonald was called to Bristow's Washington office and confronted by Bristow and showed massive evidence against McDonald, who confessed to being the ring leader. However, after McDonald left Bristow's office, knowing he would be indicted, he unsuccessfully asked Wilson for indemnity from prosecution, and that the corrupt distilleries not be raided. McDonald pleaded that prosecution of the Whiskey Ring would hurt the Republican Party in Missouri. Wilson said later that he would have had McDonald fired on the spot, had he had the authority to do so. =Prosecution= On May 7, 1875 Bristow gave Grant the investigation findings of corruption by the Whiskey Ring and stressed the need for immediate prosecution. Without hesitation Grant gave Bristow permission to go after the ring, and told Bristow to move relentlessly against all those who were culpable. Three days later, on May 10, Bristow struck hard shattering the ring at one blow. Treasury agents raided and shut down distilleries, rectifying houses, and bottling plants in St. Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee, and six other Mid-Western states. Internal Revenue offices were placed under custody of the Treasury, while thirty-two installations were taken over. Books, papers, and tax receipts were confiscated, that proved and identified individual ring members guilt. Overwhelming evidence against the ring was collected, while federal grand juries produced over 350 indictments. A Republican Party patronage boss in Wisconsin was linked to corruption found in Milwaukee. Evidence suggested almost every Republican office holder in Chicago profited from illegal distilling. St. Louis proved to be the kingpin city of the Whiskey Ring. In the past six months, $1,650,000 in taxes was evaded, while over two years the tax evasion number reached $4,000,000. Bristow instituted almost 250 federal civil and criminal lawsuits against ring members, and within a year, Bristow, recovered $3,150,000 in unpaid taxes, and obtained 110 convictions on 176 indicted ring members. Chief clerk of the Treasury, Willam Avery, St. Louis revenue collector General John McDonald, and St. Louis deputy collector, John A. Joyce, were indicted and convicted. =Babcock's St. Louis trial= Bristow's investigation extended into the White House, as evidence suggested Grant's private Secretary, Orville E. Babcock, was a secret and paid informer of the Whiskey Ring. Bristow found two incriminating and cryptic letters signed \\"Sylph\\", believed to have been Babcock's handwriting. The first was dated December 10, 1874 that said, \\"I have succeeded. They will not go. I will write you.\\" The other letter was dated February 3, 1875 that said, \\"We have official information that the enemy weakens. Push things.\\" In October 1875, Bristow brought the two letters to Grant's cabinet meeting. Babcock was brought in and confronted by both Bristow and Grant's Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont. Babcock said that the messages had to do with the building of the St. Louis Eads Bridge and Missouri politics. Grant accepted Babcock's explanation over the letters. In December 1875, nonetheless, Babcock was formerly indicted in the Whiskey Ring and his trial was set for February 1876 in St. Louis. During the trial President Grant, who believed Babcock was innocent, took a deposition at the White House that defended Babcock, and it was read to the jury in St. Louis. Babcock was acquitted by the jury and he returned to Washington D.C. Resignation In the aftermath of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions, including Babcock's trial, and an upcoming 1876 presidential election, Bristow's position on Grant's cabinet became untenable. Grant was grieved at Bristow's prosecution of Babcock, whom Grant maintained was innocent. Also, rumors swirled that Bristow prosecuted the Whiskey Ring, to get the Republican nomination, that caused Grant to feel betrayed by Bristow. Largely owing to friction between himself and the president, Bristow resigned his portfolio in June 1876; as Secretary of the Treasury he advocated the resumption of specie payments and at least a partial retirement of \\"greenbacks\\"; and he was also an advocate of civil service reform. With his resignation, unlike other Grant appointed cabinet members, such as Ebenezer R. Hoar (Attorney General), Amos T. Akerman (Attorney General), and Marshall Jewell (Postmaster General), Bristow avoided the harsher reality of direct dismissal by Grant. Presidential run (1876) Republican National Convention Cincinnati, Ohio Exposition Hall 1876 Bristow was a prominent reforming candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1876 (see U.S. presidential election, 1876). He was defeated at the Republican convention; Rutherford B. Hayes received the nomination. During the 1876 Republican Presidential Convention, Stalwart members of the Republican party, friends of President Grant, believed Bristow had been disloyal to Grant during the Whiskey Ring prosecutions, by going after Babcock. Rumor spread that Bristow had prosecuted the Whiskey Ring in an attempt to gain the 1876 Presidential Republican nomination. Bristow, however, proved to be a loyal statesman and had desired to keep President Grant and the nation from scandal. When Sec. Bristow testified in front of a congressional committee on the Whiskey Ring, he would not give any specific information regarding his conversations with President Grant, having claimed executive privilege. The 1876 Republican National Convention, was held at Exposition Hall, in Cincinnati, Ohio. On the first Presidential Ballot, Bristow was third, at 113 votes, while James G. Blaine received 285 votes, followed by Oliver P. Morton, at 124 votes. On the fourth Presidential Ballot, Bristow finished second, at 126 votes, his highest number, while Blaine was first, at 292 votes. On the seventh and final Presidential Ballot, Bristow received only 21 votes. Rutherford B. Hayes, was elected the Republican presidential candidate, at 384 votes. Blaine finished a close second at 351 votes. New York attorney Benjamin Bristow Elder statesman Bristow was upset over not winning the Republican presidential nomination and over the rumor he had been disloyal to President Grant. Bristow retired from politics, never again to run for political office. After 1878, he practiced law in New York City and on October 16 he established the law partnership of Bristow, Peet, Burnett, & Opdyke. Bristow was a prominent leader of the Eastern bar and was elected the second president of the American Bar Association in 1879. Having remained an advocate of civil service reform, Bristow was vice president of the Civil Service Reform Association. Bristow often ably argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. Death and burial In 1896, Bristow suffered appendicitis and died at his home on June 22, 1896. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York. Historical reputation Historians primarily admire Bristow's prosecution and shutting down the Whiskey Ring during his term as Grant's Secretary of Treasury. Although a lawyer by trade and having no financial training, he was able to rid the Internal Revenue Department of corruption. Bristow demonstrated his ability and in striking down the Whiskey Ring that was supported by powerful political forces. Bristow's zeal for reform, while he was Grant's appointed Secretary of Treasury, was in part motivated by a sincere belief to clean up the Republican Party from corruption, and in part, an ambition to run for the presidency, and be nominated on the 1876 Republican presidential ticket. His prosecutions offended the social and political Republican Party stalwarts who supported patronage, forcing him out of office. As the first Solicitor General Bristow aided in prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan that enabled African Americans in the South to vote freely without fear of violent retaliation. He was born a Southerner in Kentucky, but he lived the remaining years of his life in New York. Historian Jean Edward Smith said Bristow's appointment to Secretary of Treasury was \\"one of Grant's best.\\" Smith said Bristow \\"brought a reforming zeal to the Grant administration, reinforced by a heady dose of ambition that was not out of place for a man in his early forties.\\" Historian Charles W. Calhoun, had a less positive view of Bristow. Calhoun said Bristow was \\"ambitious\\" and had a \\"contentious nature\\". Historian Ronald C. White said Bristow, as Secretary of Treasury, \\"brought honesty to the position\\". Historian Ron Chernow said Bristow was \\"honest and competent\\", and: \\"A zealous advocate of civil service reform\\". Historian William S. McFeely said Grant's appointment of Bristow to run the Treasury was \\"reluctant\\", and \\"the department passed into the impeccably clean hands of Benjamin Bristow, a sound money man.\\" References Sources Books * scholarly review and response by Calhoun at DOI: 10.14296/RiH/2014/2270  * Journals * New York Times * Further reading * * Webb, Ross A., Benjamin Helm Bristow, border state politician, University Press of Kentucky (1969).

The team plays in the International League. The Triple-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Indians play at Victory Field in downtown Indianapolis. The team's mascot is Rowdie the Bear. Founded in 1902, the Indianapolis Indians are the second-oldest minor league franchise in American professional baseball (after the Rochester Red Wings). The 1902 and 1948 Indians were recognized as being among the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. History The 1902 Indianapolis Indians The first attempt at professional baseball in Indianapolis came in the 1870s, when a club called the Indianapolis Blues operated in the National League in 1878. After a hiatus, organized baseball began again in 1887, and the city has had pro ball almost every year since then. After 15 years of various franchises competing in various leagues (including four years in the National League and one year in the American Association), the current Indianapolis Indians franchise was founded as an original member of the American Association in 1902. That year's team won 95 games and the first of 21 pennants. The ballclub played its early seasons at several ballparks, including two on Washington Street, before Norm Perry, who took ownership of the team in 1929, built a new stadium on 16th Street in 1931, the Indians playing their first game there on September 5, 1931. He named the park Perry Stadium in honor of his brother James who had been killed in a plane crash. That ballpark was renamed Victory Field in 1942, and Bush Stadium in 1967, and remained the Tribe's home until July 1996. Norm Perry sold the team to Frank E. McKinney and Donie Bush in December 1941. Those two men ran the club for 10 seasons. The Cleveland Indians purchased the team in 1952, but after losing $500,000 on the operation over four seasons, looked to move the team. The Indianapolis community rallied to save the Indians. Funeral director Robert E. Kirby, Chairman of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce Athletic Committee, obtained an option to purchase the franchise from Cleveland. A broad-based sale of stock in the team was organized. Stock was priced at $10 per share with a 100-share limit on individual purchases. Kirby, William R. Kraft, David M. Lewis, Thomas A. Moynahan, and Thomas J. O'Brien got the ball rolling with investments of $200 each, and the certificate of incorporation for Indians, Inc. was received from the state of Indiana on November 9, 1955. Media promotion of the stock sale was intense. The Indianapolis Star, The Indianapolis News, and the Indianapolis Times ran complete lists of stock purchasers and their addresses. So successful was the drive that the original 16,000-share purchase authorization of capital stock was increased to 25,000 shares by the Secretary of State on December 5 following stockholder approval on November 30. Eventually the new corporation stopped accepting investments in February after a total of 20,488 shares had been purchased by 6,672 investors. Former Indians player, manager, and owner Donie Bush was named the first President of Indians, Inc. He held that position until January 1969. In 1956, the Indianapolis Indians were 92‚Äì62. On May 18, they defeated the Louisville Colonels 24‚Äì0. The Indians went on to win the 1956 Junior World Series by defeating the Rochester Red Wings. In Game 2 of the Junior World Series, Roger Maris set a record by getting seven RBIs.Roger Maris: Baseball's Reluctant Hero, p.80, Tom Clavin and Danny Peary, Touchstone Books, Simon & Schuster, New York, 2010, Max Schumacher joined the Indians front office as ticket manager in 1957. He added the duties of publicity director in 1959, and became the club's general manager in 1961‚Äîa post he held through 1997. Max was also named the team's President in 1969 following Bush's retirement. To this day, he continues as President and Chairman of the Board of Indians, Inc. Under his direction, the corporation has turned a profit for 35 straight years. The team captured three straight pennants from 1961 to 1963, including the International League championship in 1963. (The Indians competed in the American Association until it briefly disbanded after 1962. The Tribe joined the IL for one season before belonging to the Pacific Coast League from 1964 through 1968. At that point the Indians rejoined the American Association.) In 1969, Vern Rapp joined as manager of the Indians for 7 years. During that time, the Indians won two American Association pennants. The Indians had been affiliated with several Major League clubs over the years including Cincinnati (1939‚Äì41, 1961), Boston Braves (1946‚Äì47), Pittsburgh (1948‚Äì1951), Cleveland (1952‚Äì1956), Philadelphia (1960) and the Chicago White Sox (1962‚Äì67). Beginning in 1968 they had a working agreement with the Cincinnati Reds that lasted through 1983. In addition to four first-place finishes and one playoff championship in that time period, Indianapolis fans saw numerous members of \\"The Big Red Machine\\" come through town. Players like Pedro Borb√≥n, Bernie Carbo, Dave Concepci√≥n, Dan Driessen, George Foster, Ken Griffey, Ray Knight, and Hal McRae all donned Tribe uniforms. The most glorious run in team history came in the 1980s after the team affiliated with the Montreal Expos. In a six- year period (1984‚Äì1989), the Indians won four division titles, four straight league championships (1986‚Äì1989) and two consecutive Triple-A Classic playoffs (1988‚Äì1989) over the champions of the International League. Delino DeShields, Andr√©s Galarraga, Marquis Grissom, Randy Johnson, and Larry Walker played for Indianapolis during those years. The Indians affiliated again with Cincinnati from 1993 to 1999, leading to two more pennants and a league championship (1994). In 1998, Triple-A baseball expanded to 30 teams and consolidated into two leagues, with the Indians returning to the International League. After becoming the top affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers in 2000, the Tribe won the league championship and went on to capture the Triple-A World Series in Las Vegas. But sub-.500 finishes during the next four seasons prompted the Indians to break from the Brewers and join the Pittsburgh Pirates farm system for the first time since 1951. Perhaps the most significant change in Indians history came in 1996 when the team moved downtown to a new ballpark. Taking a name from the past, Victory Field, an $18 million project on the west side of downtown and part of White River State Park, opened on July 11, 1996 as the Tribe hosted the Oklahoma City 89ers. The open-air facility features 13,500 permanent seats and a lawn berm around the outfield that can seat up to 2,000 additional fans. The park also features 29 luxury suites. The ballpark was designed by the same architectural firm that designed Baltimore's Camden Yards and Cleveland's Jacobs Field. The opening of Victory Field took the Indianapolis Indians to a new level. Attendance nearly doubled with more than 600,000 fans coming to the ballpark in each of the first five full seasons. In January 1999, Baseball America dubbed Victory Field \\"the best minor league ballpark in America.\\" Those accolades were reinforced in 2001 by Sports Illustrated and minorleaguenews.com. The national commendations and record attendance marks earned the Indians a share of the national spotlight. On July 11, 2001 representatives from all 30 Triple-A teams came to Indianapolis, and a national TV audience watched on ESPN2 as the Triple-A All-Star Game took place in front of a sellout crowd of 15,868. In 2017, the Indians led all of Minor League Baseball in total attendance with 641,141 fans visiting Victory Field during the regular season. Twelve Indians players and or managers have enjoyed enough success at the Major League level to warrant induction into baseball's Hall of Fame. Those players are: Samuel \\"Big Sam\\" Thompson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Luke Appling, Gabby Hartnett, Randy Johnson, Harmon Killebrew, Nap Lajoie, Al L√≥pez, Rube Marquard, Joe McCarthy, Bill McKechnie, and Ray Schalk.

Descendants of Ziri ibn Menad, a military leader of the Cairo-based Fatimid Caliphate and the eponymous founder of the dynasty, the Zirids were Emirs who ruled in the name of the Fatimids. The Zirids gradually established their autonomy in Ifriqiya through military conquest until officially breaking with the Fatimids in the mid-11th century. The rule of the Zirid emirs opened the way to a period in North African history where political power was held by Berber dynasties such as the Almoravid dynasty, Almohad Caliphate, Zayyanid dynasty, Marinid Sultanate and Hafsid dynasty. Continuing their conquests to Fez and much of modern-day Morocco in 980, the Zirids encountered resistance from the local Zenata Berbers, who gave their allegiance to the Caliphate of Cordoba. Various Zirid branches did however rule the central Maghreb. This branch of the Zirids, at the beginning of the 11th century, following various family disputes, broke away as the Hammadids and took control of the territories of the central Maghreb. The Zirids proper were then designated as Badicides and occupied only Ifriqiyah between 1048 and 1148. Part of the dynasty fled to al-Andalus and later founded, in 1019, the Taifa of Granada on the ruins of the Caliphate of Cordoba. The Zirids of Granada were again defeated by the expansion of the Almoravids, who annexed their kingdom in 1090, while the Badicides and the Hammadids remained independent. Following the recognition of the Sunni Muslim Abbasid Caliphate and the assertion of Ifriqiya and the Central Maghreb as independent kingdoms of Sunni obedience in 1048, the Fatimids reportedly masterminded the migration of the Hilalians to the Maghreb. In the 12th century, the Hilalian invasions combined with the attacks of the Normans of Sicily on the littoral weakened Zirid power. The Almohad caliphate finally conquered the central Maghreb and Ifriqiya in 1152, thus unifying the whole of the Maghreb and ending the Zirid dynasties.  History  The Zirids were Sanhaja Berbers originating from the area of modern Algeria. In the 10th century this tribe served as vassals of the Fatimid Caliphate, defeating the Kharijite rebellion of Abu Yazid (943-947), under Ziri ibn Manad (935-971). Ziri was installed as the governor of central Maghreb and founded the gubernatorial residence of Ashir south-east of Algiers, with Fatimid support. When the Fatimids moved their capital to Egypt in 972, Ziri's son Buluggin ibn Ziri (971-984) was appointed viceroy of Ifriqiya. The removal of the fleet to Egypt made the retention of Kalbid Sicily impossible, while Algeria broke away under the governorship of Hammad ibn Buluggin, Buluggin's son. The Zirid realm (dark green) after the secession of the Hammadids (1018) and before the influx of Banu Hilal tribes (1052) The relationship with their Fatimid overlords varied - in 1016 thousands of Shiites lost their lives in rebellions in Ifriqiya, and the Fatimids encouraged the defection of Tripolitania from the Zirids, but nevertheless the relationship remained close. In 1049 the Zirids broke away completely by adopting Sunni Islam and recognizing the Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs, a move which was popular with the urban Arabs of Kairouan.Idris H. Roger, L'invasion hilƒÅlienne et ses cons√©quences, in : Cahiers de civilisation m√©di√©vale (43), Jul.-Sep. 1968, pp.353-369. The Zirid period of Tunisia is considered a high point in its history, with agriculture, industry, trade and learning, both religious and secular, all flourishing, especially in their capital, Kairouan. Management of the area by later Zirid rulers was neglectful as the agricultural economy declined, prompting an increase in banditry among the rural population. When the Zirids renounced Shia Islam and recognized the Abbasid Caliphate in 1048, the Fatimids sent the Arab tribes of the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym to Ifriqiya. The Zirids were defeated, and the land laid waste by the Bedouin conquerors. The resulting anarchy devastated the previously flourishing agriculture, and the coastal towns assumed a new importance as conduits for maritime trade and bases for piracy against Christian shipping, as well as being the last holdout of the Zirids. After the loss of Kairouan (1057) the rule of the Zirids was limited to a coastal strip with Mahdia as the capital, while several Bedouin Emirates formed inland. Between 1146 and 1148 the Normans of Sicily conquered all the coastal towns, and in 1152 the last Zirids in Algeria were superseded by the Almohad Caliphate.  Economy  The Zirid period is a time of great economic prosperity. The departure of the Fatimids to Cairo, far from ending this prosperity, saw its amplification under the Zirid and Hammadid rulers. Referring to the government of the Zirid Emir al-Mu'izz, the historian Ibn Khaldun describes: \\"It [has] never [been] seen by the Berbers of that country a kingdom more vast and more flourishing than his own.\\" The northern regions produced wheat in large quantities, while the region of Sfax was a major hub of olive production and the cultivation of the date is an important part of the local economy in Biskra. Other crops such as sugar cane, saffron, cotton, sorghum, millet and chickpea are grown. The breeding of horses and sheep was flourishing and fishing was active, providing plentiful food. The Mediterranean is also an important part of the economy, even though it was, for a time, abandoned after the departure of the Fatimids when the priority of the Zirid Emirs turned to territorial and internal conflicts. Their maritime policy enabled them to establish trade links, in particular for the importation of timber necessary for their fleet, and enabled them to begin an alliance and very close ties with the Kalbid Emirs of Sicily. They did, however, face blockade attempts by the Venetians and Normans who sought to reduce their wood supply and thus their dominance in the region. The Arab chronicler Ibn Hawqal visited and described the city of Algiers under the Zirid era: \\"The city of Algiers, is built on a gulf and surrounded by a wall. It contains a large number of bazaars and a few sources of good water near the sea. It is from these sources that the inhabitants draw the water they drink. In the outbuildings of this town are very extensive countryside and mountains inhabited by several tribes of the Berbers. The chief wealth of the inhabitants consists of herds of cattle and sheep grazing in the mountains. Algiers supplies so much honey that it forms an export object, and the quantity of butter, figs and other commodities is so great that it is exported to Kairouan and elsewhere\\".

The founder was the brother of Buluggin, Zawi ben Ziri, a general of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba under Caliph Hisham II. After the death of Almanzor in Medinaceli on 12 August 1002 (25 Ramadan 392), a civil war broke out in Al-Andalus, and General Zawi ibn Ziri destroyed several cities, such as Medina Azahara in 1011 and C√≥rdoba in 1013. He founded the Taifa of Granada, and declared himself its first emir. He died of poison in Algiers in 1019. The arts and civil construction under the rule of the Zirid governors and emirs in Al-Andalus, mainly in the Taifa of Granada, were very important. An example is the Cadima Alcazaba in Albayzin, Granada, and part of the old wall surrounding Granada.

It includes a central plain, surrounded by the Serralada Prelitoral mountain chain on the west and in the north, with the Mediterranean sand beaches of the Costa Daurada on the east and limited in the south by the Coll de Balaguer. The main towns are Tarragona, Reus, Valls and Cambrils. Salou is an important resort destination. The region is regarded as the second metropolitan area of Catalonia, hosting the most important chemical complex in Spain as well as one of the main ports. Among the most distinctive agricultural produce of the region are hazelnuts, olives, wine and fish. It is also one of the major tourist areas in Catalonia, mainly due to the variety of beaches, holiday attractions like the remains of the Roman important past of Tarragona (one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Spain), samples of the Catalan Modernisme style (particularly in Reus, Gaud√≠'s hometown) and PortAventura World (PortAventura Park, the most visited theme park in Spain, Ferrari Land and also the PortAventura Caribe Aquatic Park). The area has a common history going back to 1356. In 1936, the region was politically divided into three comarques: Alt Camp, Baix Camp and Tarragon√®s. According to the General Territorial Plan of Catalonia, the Camp de Tarragona region is one of the seven functional territorial sections of Catalonia. It covers, however, a greater area, as the neighbouring comarques of Baix Pened√®s, Priorat and Conca de Barber√† are also included. Under the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, the four provinces which make up Catalonia are due to be replaced by seven vegueries, which will also take over many of the functions of the comarques. While the final boundaries of the new vegueries have yet to be approved, the vegueria of Camp de Tarragona will most likely be formed by the same six comarques above mentioned, with the only possible exception of Baix Pened√®s if the historical region of the Pened√®s was finally accepted as an eighth vegueria, as requested by many local councils. Veguerie The Veguerie (Vegueria in Catalan) was an important feudal land division in the Principality of Catalonia, Kingdom of Sardinia, and Duchy of Athens during the Middle Ages and into the Modern Era until the Nueva Planta decrees of 1716. It was the primary division of a county in Catalonia and the basic territorial unit of government in Sardinia and Athens after those countries became part of the Crown of Aragon. The office of a veguer was called a vigeriate (Latin: vigeriatus). In 1936, Catalonia was reconstituted into comarques. Although these were quickly abolished in 1939 they were reconstituted again in 1987. Each comarca was grouped with two to four others into a veguerie, of which there were nine, with their capitals at Barcelona, Girona, Tremp, Vic, Manresa, Lleida, Reus, Tarragona, and Tortosa. Since the 1987 reconstitution it has been decided that Vegueries be formally re-established in 2011. Under the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, the four provinces which make up Catalonia are due to be replaced by seven vegueries, which will also take over many of the functions of the comarques. As of October 2008, whereas the final boundaries of the new vegueries have yet to be formally approved, they are expected to incorporate largely historical boundaries: √Ämbit metropolit√† de Barcelona, Alt Pirineu i Aran, Camp de Tarragona, Comarques Centrals, Comarques Gironines, Ponent or Lleida, Terres de l'Ebre.

History The Wicks Organ Company was founded by Adolph Wick, John F. Wick, and Louis Wick in the early 1900s at their jewelry and watch making store in Highland, Illinois. A local priest asked John Wick to study organ; he studied organ at St. Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, and then became the church organist. The church later decided to replace an old reed organ with a pipe organ. The brothers utilized their skills in watch making, cabinet making, and jewelry to construct a small, two manual and pedal, mechanical action pipe organ for the church. They incorporated as the Wicks Organ Company in 1906. The Wicks Organ Company invented, patented, and trademarked the Direct Electric chest action. This action was created in 1916 and it is still in use today. The chest action is not affected by temperature or humidity and it does not have to be re-leathered like tubular pneumatic or electro-pneumatic actions. The Wicks opus list encompasses over 6,440 instruments installed mostly in the U.S. and some throughout the world. In January 2011, the company downsized the business but is still building new instruments today. The company is outsourcing some of its production to past employees who are providing parts and services to the Wicks Organ Company. Third-generation family member Scott Wick is running the business now and is taking care of past and future Wicks customers. \\"We have several projects in the works including a rebuild of a 60-rank Moeller instrument for Christ United Methodist Church in Rochester, Minnesota, and a mostly new instrument for St. Mary's in Brussels, Illinois.\\" says president Scott Wick.

The act of issuing fatwas is called iftƒÅ æ. Muftis and their fatwas played an important role throughout Islamic history, taking on new roles in the modern era. Tracing its origins to the Quran and early Islamic communities, the practice of ifta crystallized with the emergence of the traditional legal theory and schools of Islamic jurisprudence (madhhabs). In the classical legal system, fatwas issued by muftis in response to private queries served to inform Muslim populations about Islam, advise courts on difficult points of Islamic law, and elaborate substantive law. In later times, muftis also issued public and political fatwas that took a stand on doctrinal controversies, legitimized government policies or articulated grievances of the population. Traditionally, a mufti was seen as a scholar of upright character who possessed a thorough knowledge of the Quran, hadith and legal literature. Muftis acted as independent scholars in the classical legal system. Over the centuries, Sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, while Shia jurists in Iran progressively asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era. With the spread of codified state laws and Western-style legal education in the modern Muslim world, muftis generally no longer play their traditional role of clarifying and elaborating the laws applied in courts. However, muftis have continued to advise the general public on other aspects of sharia, particularly questions regarding religious rituals and everyday life. Some modern muftis are appointed by the state to issue fatwas, while others serve on advisory religious councils. Still others issue fatwas in response to private queries on television or over the internet. Modern public fatwas have addressed and sometimes sparked controversies in the Muslim world and beyond. The legal methodology of modern ifta often diverges from pre-modern practice. While the proliferation of contemporary fatwas attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims, little research has been done to determine to what extent the Muslim public continues to acknowledge the religious authority of muftis or heeds their advice. Terminology The word mufti comes from the Arabic root f-t-y, whose meanings include \\"youth, newness, clarification, explanation.\\" A number of related terms derive from the same root. A mufti's response is called a fatwa. The person who asks a mufti for a fatwa is known as mustafti. The act of issuing fatwas is called iftƒÅ æ. The term futyƒÅ refers to soliciting and issuing fatwas. Origins The origins of muftis and the fatwa can be traced back to the Quran. On a number of occasions, the Quranic text instructs the Islamic prophet Muhammad how to respond to questions from his followers regarding religious and social practices. Several of these verses begin with the phrase \\"When they ask you concerning ..., say ...\\" In two cases (4:127, 4:176) this is expressed with verbal forms of the root f-t-y, which signify asking for or giving an authoritative answer. In the hadith literature, this three-way relationship between God, Muhammad, and believers, is typically replaced by a two-way consultation, in which Muhammad replies directly to queries from his Companions (sahaba). According to Islamic doctrine, with Muhammad's death in 632, God ceased to communicate with mankind through revelation and prophets. At that point, the rapidly expanding Muslim community turned to Muhammad's Companions, as the most authoritative voices among them, for religious guidance, and some of them are reported to have issued pronouncements on a wide range of subjects. The generation of Companions was in turn replaced in that role by the generation of Successors (tabi'un). The institution of ifta thus developed in Islamic communities under a question-and-answer format for communicating religious knowledge, and took on its definitive form with development of the classical theory of Islamic law. By the 8th century CE, muftis became recognized as legal experts who elaborated Islamic law and clarified its application to practical issues arising in the Islamic community. In pre-modern Islam Mufti's activity (iftƒÅ æ) Turkish mufti (1687 engraving) The legal theory of the ifta was formulated in the classical texts of usul al-fiqh (principles of jurisprudence), while more practical guidelines for muftis were found in manuals called adab al-mufti or adab al-fatwa (etiquette of the mufti/fatwa). A mufti's fatwa is issued in response to a query. Fatwas can range from a simple yes/no answer to a book- length treatise. A short fatwa may state a well-known point of law in response to a question from a lay person, while a \\"major\\" fatwa may give a judgment on an unprecedented case, detailing the legal reasoning behind the decision. Queries to muftis were supposed to address real and not hypothetical situations and be formulated in general terms, leaving out names of places and people. Since a mufti was not supposed to inquire into the situation beyond the information included in the query, queries regarding contentious matters were often carefully constructed to elicit the desired response. A mufti's understanding of the query commonly depended on their grasp of local customs and colloquial expressions. In theory, if the query was unclear or not sufficiently detailed for a ruling, the mufti was supposed to state these caveats in their response. Muftis often consulted another mufti on difficult cases, though this practice was not foreseen by legal theory, which saw futya as a transaction between one qualified jurist and one \\"unqualified\\" petitioner. In theory, a mufti was expected to issue fatwas free of charge. In practice, muftis commonly received support from the public treasury, public endowments or private donations. Taking of bribes was forbidden. Until the 11th or 12th century, the vast majority of jurists held other jobs to support themselves. These were generally lower- and middle-class professions such as tanning, manuscript copying or small trade. Role of muftis The classical institution of ifta is similar to jus respondendi in Roman law and the responsa in Jewish law. Muftis have played three important roles in the classical legal system: * managing information about Islam by providing legal advice to Muslim populations as well as counseling them in matters of ritual and ethics; * advising courts of law on finer points of Islamic law, in response to queries from judges; * elaborating substantive Islamic law, particularly though a genre of legal literature developed by author-jurists who collected fatwas of prominent muftis and integrated them into books. A mufti gives sexual advice in response to a woman's complaint about her son-in- law's inability to consummate his marriage to her daughter. Ottoman manuscript, 1721. Islamic doctrine regards the practice of ifta as a collective obligation (far·∏ç al-kifƒÅya), which must be discharged by some members of the community. Before the rise of modern schools, the study of law was a centerpiece of advanced education in the Islamic world. A relatively small class of legal scholars controlled the interpretation of sharia on a wide range of questions essential to the society, ranging from ritual to finance. It was considered a requirement for qualified jurists to communicate their knowledge through teaching or issuing fatwas. The ideal mufti was conceived as an individual of scholarly accomplishments and exemplary morals, and muftis were generally approached with the respect and deference corresponding to these expectations. Judges generally sought an opinion from a mufti with higher scholarly authority than themselves for difficult cases or potentially controversial verdicts. Fatwas were routinely upheld in courts, and if a fatwa was disregarded, it was usually because another fatwa supporting a different position was judged to be more convincing. If a party in a dispute was not able to obtain a fatwa supporting their position, they would be unlikely to pursue their case in court, opting for informal mediation instead, or abandoning their claim altogether. Sometimes muftis could be petitioned for a fatwa relating to a court judgement that has already been passed, acting as an informal appeals process, but the extent of this practice and its mechanism varied across history. While in most of the Islamic world judges were not required to consult muftis by any political authority, in Muslim Spain this practice was mandatory, so that a judicial decision was considered invalid without prior approval by a legal specialist. Author- jurists collected fatwas by muftis of high scholarly reputation and abstracted them into concise formulations of legal norms for the benefit of judges, giving a summary of jurisprudence for a particular madhhab (legal school). Author-jurists sought out fatwas that reflected the social conditions of their time and place, often opting for later legal opinions which were at variance with the doctrine of early authorities. Research by Wael Hallaq and Baber Johansen has shown that the rulings of muftis collected in these volumes could, and sometimes did, have a significant impact on the development of Islamic law. During the early centuries of Islam, the roles of mufti, author- jurist and judge were not mutually exclusive. A jurist could lead a teaching circle, conduct a fatwa session, and adjudicate court cases in a single day, devoting his night hours to writing a legal treatise. Those who were able to act in all four capacities were regarded as the most accomplished jurists. Qualifications of a mufti Algerian mufti, British drawing (1817) The basic prerequisite for issuing fatwas under the classical legal theory was religious knowledge and piety. According to the adab al-mufti manuals, a mufti must be an adult, Muslim, trusted and reliable, of good character and sound mind, an alert and rigorous thinker, trained as a jurist, and not a sinner. On a practical level, the stature of muftis derived from their reputation for scholarly expertise and upright character. Issuing of fatwas was among the most demanding occupations in medieval Islam and muftis were among the best educated religious scholars of their time. According to legal theory, it was up to each mufti to decide when he was ready to practice. In practice, an aspiring jurist would normally study for several years with one or several recognized scholars, following a curriculum that included Arabic grammar, hadith, law and other religious sciences. The teacher would decide when the student was ready to issue fatwas by giving him a certificate (ijaza). During the first centuries of Islam, it was assumed that a mufti was a mujtahid, i.e., a jurist who is capable of deriving legal rulings directly from the scriptural sources through independent reasoning (ijtihad), evaluating the reliability of hadith and applying or even developing the appropriate legal methodologies. Starting from around 1200 CE, legal theorists began to accept that muftis of their time may not possess the knowledge and legal skill to perform this activity. In addition, it was felt that the major question of jurisprudence had already been addressed by master jurists of earlier times, so that later muftis only had to follow the legal opinions established within their legal school (taqlid). At that point, the notions of mufti and mujtahid became distinguished, and legal theorists classified jurists into three or more levels of competence. Unlike the post of qadi, which is reserved for men in the classical sharia system, fatwas could be issued by qualified women as well as men. In practice, the vast majority of jurists who completed the lengthy curriculum in linguistic and religious sciences required to obtain the qualification to issue fatwas were men. Slaves and persons who were blind or mute were likewise theoretically barred from the post of a judge, but not that of mufti. Mufti vs. judge The mufti and the judge play different roles in the classical sharia system, with corresponding differences between a fatwa and a qada (court decision): * A fatwa is nonbinding, while a court decision is binding and enforceable. * A fatwa may deal with rituals, ethical questions, religious doctrines and sometimes even philosophical issues, while court cases dealt with legal matters in the narrow sense. * The authority of a court judgment applies only to the specific court case, while a fatwa applies to all cases that fit the premises of the query. * A fatwa is made on the basis of information provided in the request, while a judge actively investigates the facts of the case. * A judge evaluates rival claims of two parties in a dispute in order to reach a verdict, while a fatwa is made on the basis of information provided by a single petitioner. * Fatwas by prominent jurists were collected in books as sources of precedent, while court decisions were entered into court registers, but not otherwise disseminated. * While both muftis and judges were interpreters of sharia, judicial interpretation centered on evaluating evidence such as testimony and oath, while a mufti investigated textual sources of law (scripture and legal literature). * In the classical legal system, judges were civil servants appointed by the ruler, while muftis were private scholars and not appointed officials. Institutions Ulugh Beg Madrasa, Samarkand (est. 1422) Before the 11th century CE, anyone who possessed scholarly recognition as an Islamic jurist could issue fatwas. Starting around that time, however, the public office of mufti began to appear alongside the private issuing of fatwas. In Khurasan, the rulers appointed a head of the local ulama, called shaykh al-Islam, who also functioned as the chief mufti. The Mamluks appointed four muftis, one for each of the four Sunni madhhabs, to the appeals courts of provincial capitals. The Ottomans organized muftis into a hierarchical bureaucracy with a chief mufti of the empire called shaykh al-islam at the top. The Ottoman shaykh al- Islam (Turkish: ≈üeyh√ºlislam), was among the most powerful state officials. Scribes reviewed queries directed to Ottoman muftis and rewrote them to facilitate issuing of fatwas. In Mughal India and Safavid Iran the chief mufti had the title of sadr. For the first few centuries of Islam, muftis were educated in informal study circles, but beginning in the 11th and 12th centuries, the ruling elites began to establish institutions of higher religious learning known as madrasas in an effort to secure support and cooperation of the ulema (religious scholars). Madrasas, which were primarily devoted to the study of law, soon multiplied throughout the Islamic world, helping to spread Islamic learning beyond urban centers and to unite diverse Islamic communities in a shared cultural project. In some states, such as Muslim Spain, muftis were assigned to courts in advisory roles. In Muslim Spain jurists also sat on a shura (council) advising the ruler. Muftis were additionally appointed to other public functions, such as market inspectors. = In Shia Islam = While the office of the mufti was gradually subsumed into the state bureaucracy in much of the Sunni Muslim world, Shia religious establishment followed a different path in Iran starting from the early modern era. During Safavid rule, independent Islamic jurists (mujtahids) claimed the authority to represent the hidden imam. Under the usuli doctrine that prevailed among Twelver Shias in the 18th century and under the Qajar dynasty, the mujtahids further claimed to act collectively as deputies of the imam. According to this doctrine, all Muslims are supposed to follow a high-ranking living mujtahid bearing the title of marja' al-taqlid, whose fatwas are considered binding, unlike fatwas in Sunni Islam. Thus, in contrast to Sunni muftis, Shia mujtahids gradually achieved increasing independence from the state. Public and political fatwas While most fatwas were delivered to an individual or a judge, some fatwas that were public or political in nature played an important role in religious legitimation, doctrinal disputes, political criticism, or political mobilization. As muftis were progressively incorporated into government bureaucracies in the course of Islamic history, they were often expected to support government policies. Ottoman sultans regularly sought fatwas from the chief mufti for administrative and military initiatives, including fatwas sanctioning jihad against Mamluk Egypt and Safavid Iran. Fatwas by the Ottoman chief mufti were also solicited by the rulers to legitimize new social and economic practices, such as financial and penal laws enacted outside of sharia, printing of nonreligious books (1727) and vaccination (1845). At other times muftis wielded their influence independently of the ruler, and several Ottoman and Moroccan sultans were deposed by a fatwa. This happened, for example, to the Ottoman sultan Murad V on the grounds of his insanity. Public fatwas were also used to dispute doctrinal matters, and in some case to proclaim that certain groups or individuals who professed to be Muslim were to be excluded from the Islamic community (a practice known as takfir). In both political and scholarly sphere, doctrinal controversies between different states, denominations or centers of learning were accompanied by dueling fatwas. Muftis also acted to counteract the influence of judges and secular functionaries. By articulating grievances and legal rights of the population, public fatwas often prompted an otherwise unresponsive court system to provide redress. In the modern era Modern institutions Muhammad Abduh, who served as the second Grand Mufti of Egypt (1899-1905) in the Egyptian Dar al-Ifta Under European colonial rule, the institution of dar al-ifta was established in a number of madrasas (law colleges) as a centralized place for issuing of fatwas, and these organizations to a considerable extent replaced independent muftis as religious guides for the general population. Following independence, most Muslim states established national organizations devoted to issuing fatwas. One example is the Egyptian Dar al-Ifta, founded in 1895, which has served to articulate a national vision of Islam through fatwas issued in response to government and private queries. National governments in Muslim-majority countries also instituted councils of senior religious scholars to advise the government on religious matters and issue fatwas. These councils generally form part of the ministry for religious affairs, rather than the justice department, which may have a more assertive attitude toward the executive branch. While chief muftis of earlier times oversaw a hierarchy of muftis and judges applying traditional jurisprudence, most modern states have adopted European-influenced legal codes and no longer employ traditional judicial procedures or traditionally trained judges. State muftis generally promote a vision of Islam that is compatible with state law of their country. Although some early theorists argued that muftis should not respond to questions on certain subjects, such as theology, muftis have in practice handled queries relating to a wide range of subjects. This trend continued in modern times, and contemporary state-appointed muftis and institutions for ifta respond to government and private queries on varied issues, including political conflicts, Islamic finance, and medical ethics, contributing to shaping a national Islamic identity. Muftis in modern times have increasingly relied on the process of ijtihad, i.e. deriving legal rulings based on an independent analysis rather than conformity with the opinions of earlier legal authorities (taqlid). While in the past muftis were associated with a particular school of law (madhhab), in the 20th century many muftis began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional schools of jurisprudence. Modern media have facilitated cooperative forms to ifta. Networks of muftis are commonly engaged by fatwa websites, so that queries are distributed among the muftis in the network, who still act as individual jurisconsults. In other cases, Islamic jurists of different nationalities, schools of law, and sometimes even denominations (Sunni and Shia), coordinate to issue a joint fatwa, which is expected to command greater authority with the public than individual fatwas. The collective fatwa (sometimes called ijtihƒÅd jamƒÅ øƒ´, \\"collective legal interpretation\\") is a new historical development, and it is found in such settings as boards of Islamic financial institutions and international fatwa councils. There exists no international Islamic authority to settle differences in interpretation of Islamic law. An International Islamic Fiqh Academy was created by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, but its legal opinions are not binding. Role in politics In the modern era, public \\"fatwa wars\\" have reflected political controversies in the Muslim world, from anti-colonial struggles to the Gulf War of the 1990s, when muftis in some countries issued fatwas supporting collaboration with the US-led coalition, while muftis from other countries endorsed the Iraqi call for jihad against the US and its collaborators. Tobacco protest fatwa issued by Mirza Shirazi During the era of Western colonialism, some muftis issued fatwas seeking to mobilize popular resistance to foreign domination, while others were induced by colonial authorities to issue fatwas supporting accommodation with colonial rule. Muftis also intervened in the political process on many other occasions during the colonial era. For example, in 1904 a fatwa by Moroccan ulema achieved the dismissal of European experts hired by the state, while in 1907 another Moroccan fatwa succeeded in deposing the sultan for failing to defend the state against French aggression. The 1891 tobacco protest fatwa by the Iranian mujtahid Mirza Shirazi, which prohibited smoking as long as the British tobacco monopoly was in effect, also achieved its goals. Some muftis in the modern era, like the mufti of the Lebanese republic in the mid-20th century and the Grand Mufti of the Sultanate of Oman, were important political leaders. In Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini used proclamations and fatwas to introduce and legitimize a number of institutions, including the Council of the Islamic Revolution and the Iranian Parliament. Khomeini's most publicized fatwa was the proclamation condemning Salman Rushdie to death for his novel The Satanic Verses. Many militant and reform movements in modern times have disseminated fatwas issued by individuals who do not possess the qualifications traditionally required of a mufti. A famous example is the fatwa issued in 1998 by Osama Bin Laden and four of his associates, proclaiming \\"jihad against Jews and Crusaders\\" and calling for killing of American civilians. In addition to denouncing its content, many Islamic jurists stressed that bin Laden was not qualified to either issue a fatwa or declare a jihad. The Amman Message was a statement, signed in 2005 in Jordan by nearly 200 prominent Islamic jurists, which served as a \\"counter-fatwa\\" against a widespread use of takfir (excommunication) by jihadist groups to justify jihad against rulers of Muslim-majority countries. The Amman Message recognized eight legitimate schools of Islamic law and prohibited declarations of apostasy against them. The statement also asserted that fatwas can be issued only by properly trained muftis, thereby seeking to delegitimize fatwas issued by militants who lack the requisite qualifications. Erroneous and sometimes bizarre fatwas issued by unqualified or eccentric individuals acting as muftis has at times given rise to complaints about a \\"chaos\\" in the modern practice of ifta. Role in society Sheikh Absattar Derbisali, the Grand Mufti of Kazakhstan Advances in print media and the rise of the internet have changed the role played by muftis in modern society. In the pre-modern era, most fatwas issued in response to private queries were read only by the petitioner. Early in the 20th century, the reformist Islamic scholar Rashid Rida responded to thousands of queries from around the Muslim world on a variety of social and political topics in the regular fatwa section of his Cairo-based journal Al-Manar. In the late 20th century, when the Grand Mufti of Egypt Sayyid Tantawy issued a fatwa allowing interest banking, the ruling was vigorously debated in the Egyptian press by both religious scholars and lay intellectuals. In the internet age, a large number of websites has appeared offering fatwas to readers around the world. For example, IslamOnline publishes an archive of \\"live fatwa\\" sessions, whose number approached a thousand by 2007, along with biographies of the muftis. Together muftis who issue call-in fatwas during radio shows and satellite television programs, these sites have contributed to the rise of new forms of contemporary ifta. Unlike the concise or technical pre-modern fatwas, fatwas delivered through modern mass media often seek to be more expansive and accessible to the wide public. As the influence of muftis in the courtroom has declined in modern times, there has been a relative increase in the proportion of fatwas dealing with rituals and further expansion in purely religious areas like Quranic exegesis, creed, and Sufism. Modern muftis issue fatwas on topics as diverse as insurance, sex-change operations, moon exploration and beer drinking. In the private sphere, some muftis have begun to resemble social workers, giving advice on various personal issues encountered in everyday life. The vast amount of fatwas produced in the modern world attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims. However, there is little research available to indicate to what extent Muslims acknowledge the authority of muftis and heed their rulings in real life.

Kolkhozes, or collective farms, were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organized by the state on land confiscated from former large estates (so-called \\"state reserve land\\" that was left over after distribution of land to individuals) and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind) among the members. In farms of both types, however, a system of internal passports prevented movement of employees and members from rural areas to urban areas. In effect farmers became tied to their sovkhoz or kolkhoz in what is described by some as a system of \\"neo-serfdom\\".How Russia Is Ruled, by Merle Fainsod, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, revised edition (1970), p. 570.

Born in West Pennant Hills, New South Wales, Beadell is sometimes called \\"the last true Australian explorer\\". Early life Beadell's paternal grandparents came from England in the mid 1870s. His father Fred Algernon Beadell, was born in Sydney and mother Viola Pearl Mackay was from Townsville. They were married in Townsville in December 1914, and soon moved to the Sydney area. A daughter Phyllis was born in 1917, followed by Len in April 1923. Beadell's primary education began at Gladesville Public School, Ryde in 1928 and continued at Burwood Public School in 1930, both suburbs of Sydney. At the suggestion of a school friend, Beadell joined the 1st Burwood Scout Troop where he met the scoutmaster John Richmond, who was to have a major influence on Beadell's life. Richmond had served in the army during World War I, and was employed as a draughtsman and surveyor for the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board in Sydney. During the years 1931 to 1941, Beadell spent most weekends on bush survey trips with other scouts and Richmond, camping and searching for old survey marks. He learnt about the technical aspects of astronomical sightings and how to use a theodolite. In 1938 with a group of six scouts, Richmond took Beadell to Lord Howe Island where they took star sightings and determined that the mapped position of the island was out by about in latitude. Beadell finished his formal education at Sydney Grammar School in 1939, and went directly to a temporary surveying position with the water board in northern New South Wales, which had been arranged by Richmond. War service At the age of 18 in 1941, Beadell received his call up notice for the army, and was keen to enlist. The service period was specified as the length of the war plus twelve months. His initial service was in the Army Service Corps at Bathurst, New South Wales, where he spent most of the time driving three ton trucks. In February 1942 he went to the 2nd Australian Field Survey Company AIF, and carried out contour surveys for army maps. In October he sailed for New Guinea with the 8th Field Survey Section, and spent the following 14 months in the jungle of the Owen Stanley Range. Most of 1943 was spent in the Milne Bay locality and it was here that Beadell developed his artistic skills by watching army artists whose job was to draw maps from information supplied by surveyors. He returned to Sydney in December for a period of leave and further survey work in Queensland. By March 1945 he was back in New Guinea at Lae with the 3rd Field Survey Company. The company moved by ship to Wewak where there was a large enemy presence. Their assigned tasks were to map the coastal area, and build a new airstrip. The strip was completed in August 1945, just as the war came to an end. Survey Exploration Towards the middle of 1946, Beadell was asked if he would waive his discharge from the army for a further twelve months, as a new scientific expedition in the Darwin-Katherine region of the Northern Territory needed a capable surveyor. Beadell wasted no time in accepting the appointment. When that assignment was completed in November, he was asked once more to waive his discharge, as another project was in the making. The British and Australian governments had decided to build a rocket testing range in outback Australia, and Beadell was chosen to locate a suitable site. He accepted the challenge, and began work with a surveying team in the central desert area of South Australia. He chose the site which became known as Woomera in March 1947. Further work was required to select and survey launching pad sites, the centreline of fire for rockets, and the airfield. The site of the future village was also chosen, allowing for approach paths of the runway and natural drainage. His discharge from the Army became effective in December 1948. In November 1949 he was asked to rejoin the project, and began further surveying for the Long Range Weapons Establishment in August 1950. A site for the secret testing of a British atomic bomb was selected by Beadell in 1952, and a road from Mabel Creek to the test site Emu Field was built by him in March 1953, his first road. Gunbarrel Highway Beadell's best known road is the Gunbarrel Highway, so named after the Gunbarrel Road Construction PartyBeadell,L(1965).Too Long in the Bush,p.20.New Holland Publishers (Australia). which was assembled by him; he said he tried whenever possible to make the road as straight as a gunbarrel. The road was built with initial reconnaissance and survey by Len, usually alone, pushing through raw scrub in a Land Rover. He used a theodolite to observe the sun or stars for latitude and longitude calculations. Once the line of the road had been decided, a bulldozer followed to cut a raw track, clearing away the spinifex and mulga scrub to form a basic level track. This was then graded using a standard road grader. The Gunbarrel Highway was begun at Victory Downs homesteadBayly,I.A.E.(2009).Len Beadell's Legacy.Bas Publishing, Seaford,Victoria. which is by road south of Alice Springs, then pushed west to the Rawlinson Ranges, skirting south of the Gibson Desert, via the mission at Warburton, to connect to an existing road at Carnegie Station. Total distance was about . Len's stories of the building of this road are told in the first of his numerous books Too Long in the Bush, a reading of which will give some insight into the incredible feat that building this road was. Len suffered near starvation, many mechanical breakdowns, countless punctures and other mishaps, all in searing desert heat, but seemingly took it all in his stride with good humour. Later Roads Beadell's sense of humour was well known, and he referred to many of his roads as \\"highways\\". The description stuck, and maps show the subject roads as highways, despite the reality that they have degraded to single lane unsealed tracks through the remote arid areas of central Australia. Following the Gunbarrel Highway, Len built further roads by the same method, naming most of them after his family. The Connie Sue Highway for his daughter, the Gary Highway and Gary Junction Road for his son, the Anne Beadell Highway for his wife and Jackie Junction for his youngest daughter. These roads further opened up the inhospitable country, for a variety of purposes. In addition, Beadell chose and surveyed the location for the Giles Meteorological Station and airstrip (during construction of the Gunbarrel Highway). Bush Dentist During a break from construction of the Gunbarrel Highway in June 1957, Beadell convinced a visiting dental surgeon at Woomera, Dr Bruce Dunstan, to give him a crash course on tooth extraction. Beadell had prior experience of the trouble that teeth could cause himself and his crew when days or weeks away from city facilities. This instruction and further assistance from an Alice Springs dentist, Ray Meldrum, equipped him with dental supplies and local anaesthetics sufficient for bush work. Beadell carried out his first extraction in March 1958 on Cyril Koch, a cook, during construction of the Gunbarrel Highway. By the time road building was completed in 1963, Len had pulled 29 teeth, joking that he had 29 notches on his forceps. Legacy Neale Junction - Len Beadell marker plate photographed in June 2007 Len Beadell marked \\"astrofixes\\" along his roads with aluminium plates on which latitude, longitude and other information was stamped. Many of these have sadly been taken as souvenirs; there is a program underway to replace these with replicas. Len's legacy is also to be seen on many standard Australian road maps of central desert areas, showing such things as \\"Len Beadell's Tree\\", and \\"Len Beadell's Burnt Out Truck\\". Mount Beadell in Western Australia was formally named after him by the Surveyor General of Western Australia in 1958. There is a stone cairn, memorial plaque, and a replica of his theodolite atop the mountain. () In modern times a newer road, the Great Central Road, has superseded some of Beadell's original tracks by taking a more direct route, made possible with more modern heavy equipment. However, all of Len's original roads still exist, and are popular with hardcore four wheel drive enthusiasts. They may be difficult to negotiate and require a great deal of preparation. Almost all of them lie in aboriginal lands which require travel permits. He was a good caricaturist and watercolour artist. He drew cartoons of staff working at Maralinga and paintings of Aboriginal people who came to the Maralinga camps. The Beadell family sell books and memorabilia, and his daughter operates a bush tour business.

Instead, they ran out of food and began to eat the only available food source ‚Äî lichen ‚Äî until forced to return to Kane's main group, where Hayes then underwent the amputation of three of his frostbitten toes before Kane ordered the group to head to Greenland via sledge and boat. After reaching New York in October 1855 and recuperating from the ordeal, Hayes then embarked on a lecture tour, speaking before audiences at the American Geographical Society and Smithsonian InstitutionDrabelle, \\"Pointing the Way to the Pole.\\" and eventually becoming \\"the most prolific lecturer and writer on the Arctic in the nineteenth century,\\" according to biographer Douglas Wamsley.Wamsley, Douglas W. Polar Hayes: The Life and Contributions of Isaac Israel Hayes, M.D, (American Philosophical Society Press, 2009) The icebound schooner United States, formerly Spring Hill of Boston After raising $30,000, Hayes also led his own expedition from 1860 to 1861. Departing in June 1860 aboard the United States, he ultimately hoped to reach the North Pole. After arriving in Greenland, where he encouraged several Eskimos to join his 20-man party as hunters to ensure that his crew would not be forced to endure the hunger and starvation experienced by previous expeditions, Hayes and his men then set out for Baffin Bay, Smith Sound and Ellesmere Island en route to the Open Polar Sea but, like others before him, was eventually forced by the terrain, harsh climate and dwindling food supplies to turn back. Taking a measurement with his sextant before making the turnaround, he recorded that he and his men had reached 81¬∞35' north, 70¬∞30' west ‚Äî which, if his measurement was accurate, would have meant that he and his men had reached the farthest point north to date of any polar expedition. His journal entries did not match the position he had written down in the frigid cold, however, leading subsequent researchers to conclude that he had overestimated his reach by more than , and to speculate that Hayes may have mistakenly noted that his sextant observations of the sun had been taken at noon when they hadn't or that he had inverted the second digit of the group's farthest lone lower limb to read 56¬∞52‚Ä≤ instead of the true observation 59¬∞52‚Ä≤. According to researchers, the farthest point reached by Hayes was Cape Collinson, less than north of 80¬∞ north, longitude 70¬∞30‚Ä≤ west.Barr, William.

Believing that they had achieved at least part of their objectives, Hayes and his team reached Greenland only to learn that their nation had descended into Civil War.Drabelle, \\"Pointing the Way to the Pole.\\" American Civil War Satterlee General Hospital, West Philadelphia, c. 1864. After returning to the United States, Hayes enrolled as a surgeon with the Union Army. In 1862, he was placed in command of the Satterlee General Hospital, a sprawling 4,500-bed military hospital in Philadelphia which saw spikes in patients following the Second Battle of Bull Run and Battle of Gettysburg, the latter of which was responsible for \\"swelling the hospital population to more than 6,000\\" after \\"the greatest number of wounded were admitted to the hospital in a single month\\" during the summer of 1863.\\"Daughters of Charity Nursed Wounded Civil War Soldiers at West Philadelphia hospital.\\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Catholic Historical Research Center, Archdiocese of Pennsylvania, March 24, 2011. Rendering care to as many as 50,000 sick and wounded during the time this hospital was open, the physicians and nurses under Hayes lost only 260 patients between the time of the hospital's opening and closure, a significant achievement when considering the challenges they faced in treating not only the sheer volume of patients they were required to process, but in doing so while employing relatively rudimentary medical care procedures and sanitation practices.\\"Daughters of Charity Nursed Wounded Civil War Soldiers at West Philadelphia hospital,\\" Catholic Historical Research Center, Archdiocese of Pennsylvania.

Uses in different communication systems   FM Radio  Spectrum of an FM broadcast signal. The pilot tone is the orange vertical line on the right of the spectrogram.In FM stereo broadcasting, a pilot tone of 19 kHz indicates that there is stereophonic information at 38 kHz (19√ó2, the second harmonic of the pilot). The receiver doubles the frequency of the pilot tone and uses it as a frequency and phase reference to demodulate the stereo information. If no 19 kHz pilot tone is present, then any signals in the 23-53 kHz range are ignored by a stereo receiver. A guard band of ¬±4 kHz (15-23 kHz) protects the pilot tone from interference from the baseband audio signal (50 Hz-15 kHz) and from the lower sideband of the double sideband stereo information (23-53 kHz). The third harmonic of the pilot (19√ó3, or 57 kHz) is used for Radio Data System.  AM Radio  In AM stereo, the bandwidth is too narrow to accommodate subcarriers, so the modulation itself is changed, and the pilot tone is infrasonic (below the normal hearing range, instead of above it) at a frequency of 25 Hz.  Television  In some color television standards, the color burst placed after every sync pulse on visible lines (as done in PAL/NTSC) is the pilot signal to indicate that there are color subcarriers present and allow synchronizing the phase of the local oscillator in the demodulation circuitry. However, SECAM features continuous subcarriers which don't need their phase tracked due to being frequency-modulated as compared to the QAM approach of the other systems, thus making it unnecessary. In the NTSC television system, a pilot tone of 15.7342657 kHz is used to indicate the presence of MTS stereo.  Video Recording  In some analog video formats frequency modulation is the standard method for recording the luminance part of the signal, and is used to record a composite video signal in direct color systems, e.g. Video 2000 and some Hi-band formats a pilot tone is added to the signal to detect and correct timebase errors.  Cable  In cable service plant infrastructures, two or more pilot frequencies are used to allow network amplifiers to automatically adjust their gain over temperature swings. This is done by the amplifiers having special circuitry that track the frequencies in order to maintain a consistent gain. Without this capability, network amplifiers may drive the signal too strong or too weak; thus requiring constant adjustment. Pilot frequencies can either be generated via an agile modulator, taking the space of analog NTSC channels; or be generated by dedicated equipment. Sometimes it is necessary to employ several independent pilot frequencies. Most radio relay systems use radio or continuity pilots of their own but transmit also the pilot frequencies belonging to the carrier frequency multiplex system.

A Formula One race or Grand Prix is a sporting event which takes place over three days (usually Friday to Sunday), with a series of practice and qualifying sessions prior to a race on Sunday. Current regulations provide for two free practice sessions on Friday (Thursday for Monaco), a morning practice session and an afternoon qualifying session held on Saturday, and the race held on Sunday afternoon or evening, though the structure of the weekend has changed numerous times over the history of the sport. At most Formula One race weekends, other events such as races in other FIA series (such as Formula 2) are held.  Free practice sessions  Since 2006, three practice sessions are held before the race; the first on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon. Both sessions last one and a half hours. The third session is held on Saturday morning and lasts an hour. Testing in the middle of the season is banned, but a third driver is permitted to take part in the first Friday free practice sessions in the place of a regular driver. The Monaco Grand Prix traditionally begins on a Thursday, with Friday as a day of rest. Practice sessions for the Bahrain, Singapore and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix take place in the evening as these races are run at night.  Qualifying sessions  Traditionally before , qualifying was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday (Thursday at Monaco) afternoon from 13:00 to 14:00 local time, with the second held on Saturday afternoon at the same time. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final grid position. Each driver was limited to twelve laps per qualifying session. In 1996 qualifying was amended with the Friday qualifying session abolished in a favour for a single qualifying session held on Saturday afternoon. As previously, each driver was limited to twelve laps with the inclusion of a 107% rule to exclude drivers with slow lap times. This was calculated by using the time of the driver on pole position and adding on 7% to create a cut-off time. This format remained until the conclusion of the 2002 season. Between and , the qualifying session was run as a one-lap session and took place on Friday and Saturday afternoon with the cars running one at a time. In 2003 the Friday running order was determined with the leader of the Drivers' Championship heading out first. The Saturday running order was determined by times set in Friday afternoon qualifying with the fastest heading out last and the slowest running first. No refuelling was allowed between the start of Saturday qualifying and the start of the race, so drivers qualified on race fuel. The lap times from the Friday afternoon session did not determine the grid order. In 2004 the Friday session was moved to Saturday. The running order for the first session was now based on the result of the previous race. At first both sessions were held back-to-back, but the first session was later moved earlier in the day. At the start of 2005 the sessions were held on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. Lap times from both sessions were counted to give the overall aggregate position. From the 2005 European Grand Prix onwards, the Sunday morning session was dropped for a single run on Saturday afternoon having proved unpopular with drivers, teams and broadcasters. The running order was the reverse of the previous race result. Since , qualifying takes place on Saturday afternoon in a three-stage \\"knockout\\" system. One hour is dedicated to determining the grid order, divided into three periods with short intermissions between them. Currently, the first qualifying period is eighteen minutes long, with all twenty cars on the circuit. At the end of the period, the five slowest drivers are eliminated from further qualification rounds, and fill positions sixteen to twenty on the grid based on their fastest lap time. Any driver attempting to set a qualifying time when the period ends is permitted to finish his lap, though no new laps may be started once the chequered flag is shown. After a short break, the second period begins, with fifteen cars on the circuit. At the end of the fifteen-minute period, the five slowest drivers are once again eliminated, filling grid positions eleven to fifteen. Finally, the third qualifying period features the ten fastest drivers from the second period. The drivers have twelve minutes to set a qualifying time, which will determine the top ten positions on the grid. The driver who sets the fastest qualifying time is said to be on pole position, the grid position that offers the best physical position from which to start the race. For the first two races of the 2016 season, a modified format was used where drivers were eliminated during the sessions rather than just at the end and only eight drivers progressed to the final session. Qualifying reverted to the previous format from the third race of the season onwards. Drivers may complete as many laps as they choose. However, the top ten drivers must start the race on the set of tyres they used during their fastest lap time in the second qualifying period. These may only be changed if qualifying and the race are held under different weather conditions, or if a tyre is damaged as a result of an accident. The remaining ten drivers are free to start the race with any tyres they choose. Generally, a driver will leave the pits and drive around the track in order to get to the start/finish line (the out-lap). Having crossed the line, they will attempt to achieve the quickest time around the circuit that they can in one or more laps (the flying lap or hot lap). This is the lap time which is used in calculating grid position. Finally, the driver will continue back around the track and re- enter the pit-lane (the in-lap). However, this is merely strategy, and no teams are obliged by the rules to follow this formula. DNQ As of , ten teams are entered for the Formula One World Championship, each entering two cars for a total of twenty cars. The regulations place a limit of twenty-six entries for the championship. At some periods in the history of Formula One the number of cars entered for each race has exceeded the number permitted, which historically would vary from race to race according to the circuit used. Monaco, for example, for many years allowed only twenty cars to compete because of the restricted space available. The slowest cars excess to the circuit limit would not qualify for the race and would be list as 'Did Not Qualify' (DNQ) in race results. Pre-qualifying There had been pre- qualifying sessions in the late 1970s, but during the late 1980s and early 1990s the number of cars attempting to enter each race was as high as thirty- nine for some races. Because of the dangers of having so many cars on the track at the same time, pre-qualifying sessions were re-introduced for the teams with the worst record over the previous twelve months, including any new teams. Usually, only the four fastest cars from this session were then allowed into the qualifying session proper, where thirty cars competed for twenty-six places on the starting grid for the race. The slowest cars from the pre- qualifying session were listed in race results as 'Did Not Pre-Qualify' (DNPQ). Pre-qualifying was discontinued after 1992 when many small teams withdrew from the sport. 107% rule As the number of cars entered in the world championship fell below twenty-six, a situation arose in which any car entered would automatically qualify for the race, no matter how slowly it had been driven. The 107% rule was introduced in to prevent completely uncompetitive cars being entered in the championship. If a car's qualifying time was not within 7% of the pole sitter's time, that car would not qualify for the race, unless at the discretion of the race stewards for a situation such as a rain affected qualifying session. For example, if the pole-sitter's time was one minute and forty seconds, any car eligible for racing had to set a time within one minute and forty-seven seconds. The 107% rule was removed since the FIA's rules indicated previously that 24 cars could take the start of a Formula One race, and a minimum of twenty cars had to enter a race. In , the qualifying procedure changed to a single-lap system, rendering the rule inoperable. However, there were concerns about the pace of the new teams in the 2010 season. As the qualifying procedure had been changed since the 2006 season to a three-part knockout system, the rule could now be reintroduced. As such, the 107% rule was reintroduced in the 2011 Formula One season. Currently, cars have to be within 7% of the fastest Q1 time in order to qualify for the race. Since the rule was re-introduced, only twice have cars failed to qualify for a Grand Prix‚Äîboth times involving Hispania Racing cars and both times occurring at the Australian Grand Prix, namely in 2011 (through Vitantonio Liuzzi and Narain Karthikeyan) and 2012 (through Karthikeyan and Pedro de la Rosa). On other occasions, however, drivers who had not set a time within the desired 107% span during qualifying have been permitted to race by the stewards on grounds of corresponding lap times in free practice. For example, in the 2018 British Grand Prix neither Lance Stroll nor Brendon Hartley were able to set a time in Q1, but both were allowed to race at the stewards' discretion.  Race  :See Formula One regulations for detailed information on the race start procedure. The race itself is held on Sunday afternoon, with the exception of night races at Singapore since 2008 and Bahrain since 2014. Some races were previously held on Saturdays, but this has not happened since the 1985 South African Grand Prix. Thirty minutes prior to race time, the cars take to the track for any number of warm-up laps (formally known as reconnaissance laps), provided they pass through the pit lane and not the grid, after which they assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. At the hour of the race, a green light signifies the beginning of the relatively slow formation lap during which all cars parade around the course doing a final tire warmup and system checks. The cars then return to their assigned grid spot for the standing race start. The starting light system, which consists of five pairs of lights mounted above the start/finish line, then lights up each pair at one-second intervals. Once all five pairs are illuminated, after a random length of time (one to nine seconds), the red lights are turned off by the race director, at which point the race starts. The race length is defined as the smallest number of complete laps that exceeds 305 kilometers (the Monaco Grand Prix is the sole exception with a race length of 78 laps / 260.5 km), though occasionally some races are truncated due to special circumstances. The race can not exceed two hours in length; if this interval is reached the race will be ended at the end of the next full lap. The only exception is if the race is halted by a Red flag in which case the total time including the red flag stoppage must not exceed 4 hours (since 2012), and the total time excluding the red flag stoppage may not exceed 2 hours. Since the 2007 season, teams are supplied by the sole tyre supplier (currently Pirelli which replaced Bridgestone in 2011), and receive two different types of slick dry tyre compounds: \\"Prime\\" tyres (now either the Hard, Medium or Soft compound), and \\"Option\\" tyres (either the Medium, Soft or Supersoft compound). In 2016 teams received three different types of slick tyre. The Prime tyres are more durable than the Option tyres, however the Option tyres produce faster lap times than the Prime tyres (the Option tyres are said to be one second per lap quicker than the Prime tyres, though this figure varies between circuits). From 2014, drivers who qualify in the top ten must start the race with the tyres they used in the second qualifying session (previously this had been the tyres they used in the final qualifying session); all other drivers have freedom over which tyres they can start with. Each driver is also required to use both types of dry compound during a dry race, and so must make a mandatory pit-stop. Timing pitstops with reference to other cars is crucial‚Äîif they are following another car but are unable to pass, the driver may try to stay on the track as long as possible, or pit immediately, as newer tyres are usually faster. Prior to the 2010 season, drivers used to make pitstops for fuel more than once during a race, as the cars on average consumed two kilometres per litre (approximately five miles per gallon)- nowadays this figure is lower, due to changes in engines from 2014. From 2010, refuelling has been forbidden during a race. At the end of the race, the first, second and third-placed drivers take their places on a podium, where they stand as the national anthem of the race winner's home country and that of his team is played. Dignitaries from the country hosting the race then present trophies to the drivers and a constructor's trophy to a representative from the winner's team, and the winning drivers spray champagne and are interviewed, often by a former racing driver. The three drivers then go to a media room for a press conference where they answer questions in English and their native languages.  Points system  Points are awarded to drivers and teams based on where they finish in a race. The winner receives 25 points, the second-place finisher 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10. One additional point is awarded to the driver and team with the fastest lap of the race, if they finish in the top 10 positions. If a race has to be abandoned before 75% of the planned distance has been completed all points are halved. In a dead heat, prizes and points are added together and shared equally for all those drivers who tie. The winner of the annual championship is the driver (or team, for the Constructors' Championship) with the most points. If the number of points is the same, priority is given to the driver with more wins. If that is the same it will be decided on the most second places and so on. Historically, the races were scored on the basis of a five-place tally: i.e. via an 8‚Äì6‚Äì4‚Äì3‚Äì2 scoring system, with the holder of the fastest race lap also receiving a bonus point. In 1961, the scoring was revised to give the winner nine points instead of eight, and the single point awarded for fastest lap was given for sixth place for the first time the previous year. In 1991, the points system was again revised to give the victor 10 points, with all other scorers recording the same 6‚Äì4‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì1 result. In 2003, the FIA further revised the scoring system to apportion points to the first eight classified finishers (a classified finisher must complete 90% of race distance) on a 10‚Äì8‚Äì6‚Äì5‚Äì4‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì1 basis. At certain periods in Formula One's history, the world champion has been determined by virtue of the \\"best 7 scores\\" in each \\"half\\" of the world championship, meaning that drivers have had to \\"discard\\" lower scores in either half of the season. This was done in order to equalise the footings of teams which may not have had the wherewithal to compete in all events. With the advent of the Concorde Agreements, this practice has been discontinued, though it did feature prominently in several world championships through the 1970s and 1980s. The change in the awarding of world championship points has rendered the comparison of historical teams and drivers to current ones largely ineffective. For instance, Michael Schumacher is widely credited with being the most successful GP driver of all time. While his statistics are very impressive and easily outstrip those of his nearest competitor, it is worth noting that his points tally vs points available, and winning percentage of grands prix entered, do not significantly exceed those of Juan Manuel Fangio, whom he recently dethroned as winner of the most World Championships. As with most other sports, it is very difficult to compare stars of different eras owing to the changes in the sport and regulations.  Worldwide appeal  Despite having the highest budget in all of auto racing, Formula One racing has often been accused of being unexciting when compared to less expensive categories. The differences in driver ability are usually dwarfed when compared to the relative speed of the different makes of cars, and on-track overtaking is less common than other similar forms of racing, due to the aerodynamics of trailing cars being adversely affected by the car in front (making overtaking only possible by very risky and thus rarely taken chances, or a much faster car trailing a slower one). So, beginning in the 2011 season F1 adopted two new innovations to help with passing/overtaking and to bring a little more excitement to the races. These innovations are \\"DRS\\" and the \\"KERS\\" systems. The DRS (Drag Reduction System) allows for one of the horizontal aerofoils on the rear wing to be \\"lifted\\" open which reduces the downforce and increases the race car speed. This system is only operable on straights where rear downforce is not as important. The system cannot be activated unless the driver is within (1) second or less behind the car he is trying to pass. The DRS zones on each track are set by the F1 governing body. And although the system is controlled by computers and timers, the driver has to activate it by pushing a button on the steering wheel when he wants to use it. The \\"KERS\\" (kinetic energy recovery system) grabs and stores the energy usually lost during braking (which has always been wasted) and stores the energy into the batteries. Again, when allowed and the driver wants to use this system it is a matter of pushing a button and the engine gets another 60-80 horse power for a short time. The system will deplete/discharge this stored energy quickly and the driver has to wait until it gets charged back up. Also the use of electronic driver aids such as semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control has been widely criticized by F1 fans around the globe. Traction control was banned in the 2008 Formula One season. The sport is lesser-known in the United States than the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series or their mostly domestic open-wheel racing series, the IndyCar Series, but in terms of budgets and global TV audiences F1 is much larger than both combined. Estimates for Ferrari's racing budget in 1999 were around US$240 million, and even tailender Minardi reportedly spent 50 million. Estimates of TV audiences are around 300 million per race.

GnRH is a tropic peptide hormone synthesized and released from GnRH neurons within the hypothalamus. The peptide belongs to gonadotropin-releasing hormone family. It constitutes the initial step in the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis. Structure The identity of GnRH was clarified by the 1977 Nobel Laureates Roger Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally: pyroGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2 As is standard for peptide representation, the sequence is given from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus; also standard is omission of the designation of chirality, with assumption that all amino acids are in their L- form. The abbreviations are the standard abbreviations for the corresponding proteinogenic amino acids, except for pyroGlu, which refers to pyroglutamic acid, a derivative of glutamic acid. The NH2 at the carboxyl terminus indicates that rather than terminating as a free carboxylate, it terminates as a carboxamide. Synthesis The gene, GNRH1, for the GnRH precursor is located on chromosome 8. In mammals, the linear decapeptide end-product is synthesized from an 89-amino acid preprohormone in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus. It is the target of various regulatory mechanisms of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis, such as being inhibited by increased estrogen levels in the body. Function GnRH is secreted in the hypophysial portal bloodstream at the median eminence. The portal blood carries the GnRH to the pituitary gland, which contains the gonadotrope cells, where GnRH activates its own receptor, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor that stimulates the beta isoform of Phosphoinositide phospholipase C, which goes on to mobilize calcium and protein kinase C. This results in the activation of proteins involved in the synthesis and secretion of the gonadotropins LH and FSH. GnRH is degraded by proteolysis within a few minutes. GnRH activity is very low during childhood, and is activated at puberty or adolescence. During the reproductive years, pulse activity is critical for successful reproductive function as controlled by feedback loops. However, once a pregnancy is established, GnRH activity is not required. Pulsatile activity can be disrupted by hypothalamic- pituitary disease, either dysfunction (i.e., hypothalamic suppression) or organic lesions (trauma, tumor). Elevated prolactin levels decrease GnRH activity. In contrast, hyperinsulinemia increases pulse activity leading to disorderly LH and FSH activity, as seen in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). GnRH formation is congenitally absent in Kallmann syndrome. Control of FSH and LH At the pituitary, GnRH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These processes are controlled by the size and frequency of GnRH pulses, as well as by feedback from androgens and estrogens. Low-frequency GnRH pulses are required for FSH release, whereas high-frequency GnRH pulses stimulate LH pulses in a one-to-one manner. There are differences in GnRH secretion between females and males. In males, GnRH is secreted in pulses at a constant frequency; however, in females, the frequency of the pulses varies during the menstrual cycle, and there is a large surge of GnRH just before ovulation. GnRH secretion is pulsatile in all vertebrates, and is necessary for correct reproductive function. Thus, a single hormone, GnRH1, controls a complex process of follicular growth, ovulation, and corpus luteum maintenance in the female, and spermatogenesis in the male. Neurohormone GnRH is considered a neurohormone, a hormone produced in a specific neural cell and released at its neural terminal. A key area for production of GnRH is the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, which contains most of the GnRH-secreting neurons. GnRH neurons originate in the nose and migrate into the brain, where they are scattered throughout the medial septum and hypothalamus and connected by very long >1-millimeter-long dendrites. These bundle together so they receive shared synaptic input, a process that allows them to synchronize their GnRH release. The GnRH neurons are regulated by many different afferent neurons, using several different transmitters (including norepinephrine, GABA, glutamate). For instance, dopamine appears to stimulate LH release (through GnRH) in estrogen-progesterone-primed females; dopamine may inhibit LH release in ovariectomized females. Kisspeptin appears to be an important regulator of GnRH release. GnRH release can also be regulated by estrogen. It has been reported that there are kisspeptin-producing neurons that also express estrogen receptor alpha. Other organs GnRH is found in organs outside of the hypothalamus and pituitary, and its role in other life processes is poorly understood. For instance, there is likely to be a role for GnRH1 in the placenta and in the gonads. GnRH and GnRH receptors are also found in cancers of the breast, ovary, prostate, and endometrium. Effects of behavior GnRH production/release is one of the few confirmed examples of behavior influencing hormones, rather than the other way around. Cichlid fish that become socially dominant in turn experience an upregulation of GnRH secretion whereas cichlid fish that are socially subordinate have a down regulation of GnRH secretion. Besides secretion, the social environment as well as their behavior affects the size of GnRH neurons. Specifically, males that are more territorial have larger GnRH neurons than males that are less territorial. Differences are also seen in females, with brooding females having smaller GnRH neurons than either spawning or control females. These examples suggest that GnRH is a socially regulated hormone. Medical uses Natural GnRH was previously prescribed as gonadorelin hydrochloride (Factrel)Drugs.com Factrel: and gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate (Cystorelin)Drugs.com Cystorelin: for use in treating human diseases. Modifications of the decapeptide structure of GnRH to increase half life have led to GnRH1 analog medications that either stimulate (GnRH1 agonists) or suppress (GnRH antagonists) the gonadotropins. These synthetic analogs have replaced the natural hormone in clinical use. Its analogue leuprorelin is used for continuous infusion, to treat breast cancer, endometriosis, prostate cancer, and following research in the 1980s by researchers, including Dr. Florence Comite of Yale University, it was used to treat precocious puberty. A Cochrane Review is available which investigates whether GnRH analogues, given before or alongside chemotherapy, could prevent damage to women's ovaries caused by chemotherapy. GnRH agonists appear to be effective in protecting the ovaries during chemotherapy, in terms of menstruation recovery or maintenance, premature ovarian failure and ovulation. Animal sexual behavior GnRH activity influences a variety of sexual behaviors. Increased levels of GnRH facilitate sexual displays and behavior in females. GnRH injections enhance copulation solicitation (a type of courtship display) in white-crowned sparrows. In mammals, GnRH injections facilitate sexual behavior of female display behaviors as shown with the musk shrew‚Äôs (Suncus murinus) reduced latency in displaying rump presents and tail wagging towards males. An elevation of GnRH raises males‚Äô testosterone capacity beyond a male's natural testosterone level. Injections of GnRH in male birds immediately after an aggressive territorial encounter results in higher testosterone levels than what is observed naturally during an aggressive territorial encounter. A compromised GnRH system has aversive effects on reproductive physiology and maternal behavior. In comparison to female mice with a normal GnRH system, female mice with a 30% decrease in GnRH neurons are poor caregivers to their offspring. These mice are more likely to leave their pups scattered rather than grouped together, and will take significantly longer to retrieve their pups. Veterinary use The natural hormone is also used in veterinary medicine as a treatment for cattle with cystic ovarian disease. The synthetic analogue deslorelin is used in veterinary reproductive control through a sustained-release implant. Other names As with many hormones, GnRH has been called by various names in the medical literature over the decades since its existence was first inferred. They are as follows: * Gonadotropin-releasing factor (GnRF, GRF); Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH, GRH) * Follicle-stimulating hormone-releasing factor (FRF, FSH-RF); Follicle-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone (FRH, FSH-RH) * Luteinizing hormone-releasing factor (LRF, LHRF); Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LRH, LHRH) * Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone‚Äìreleasing factor (FSH/LH-RF); Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone- releasing hormone (FSH/LH-RH) * Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone‚Äìreleasing factor (LH/FSH-RF); Luteinizing hormone and follicle- stimulating hormone-releasing hormone (LH/FSH-RH) * Gonadorelin (INN for pharmaceutical form) *Gonadoliberin See also * Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor ¬ß Agonists * GnRH modulator * Progonadotropin * Gonadotropin surge-attenuating factor * GNRH2, a similar gene * Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone *Breastfeeding and fertility References Further reading  *  External links  * Category:Animal reproductive system Category:Antigonadotropins Category:Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropins Category:Hormones of the hypothalamus-pituitary- gonad axis Category:Human female endocrine system Category:Peptide hormones Category:Precursor proteins Category:Progonadotropins Category:Sex hormones Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances ","title":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone"},{"id":"645543","text":"Cross-section of a rock with mariposite.

Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) is a form of radar that is used to create two-dimensional images or three-dimensional reconstructions of objects, such as landscapes.Kirscht, Martin, and Carsten Rinke. \\"3D Reconstruction of Buildings and Vegetation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Images.\\" MVA. 1998. SAR uses the motion of the radar antenna over a target region to provide finer spatial resolution than conventional beam-scanning radars. SAR is typically mounted on a moving platform, such as an aircraft or spacecraft, and has its origins in an advanced form of side looking airborne radar (SLAR). The distance the SAR device travels over a target in the time taken for the radar pulses to return to the antenna creates the large synthetic antenna aperture (the size of the antenna). Typically, the larger the aperture, the higher the image resolution will be, regardless of whether the aperture is physical (a large antenna) or synthetic (a moving antenna) ‚Äì this allows SAR to create high-resolution images with comparatively small physical antennas. Additionally, SAR has the property of having larger apertures for more distant objects, allowing consistent spatial resolution over a range of viewing distances. To create a SAR image, successive pulses of radio waves are transmitted to \\"illuminate\\" a target scene, and the echo of each pulse is received and recorded. The pulses are transmitted and the echoes received using a single beam-forming antenna, with wavelengths of a meter down to several millimeters. As the SAR device on board the aircraft or spacecraft moves, the antenna location relative to the target changes with time. Signal processing of the successive recorded radar echoes allows the combining of the recordings from these multiple antenna positions. This process forms the synthetic antenna aperture and allows the creation of higher-resolution images than would otherwise be possible with a given physical antenna.\\"Introduction to Airborne RADAR\\", G. W. Stimson, Chapter 1 (13 pp). , airborne systems provide resolutions of about 10 cm, ultra-wideband systems provide resolutions of a few millimeters, and experimental terahertz SAR has provided sub- millimeter resolution in the laboratory.  Motivation and applications  SAR is capable of high-resolution remote sensing, independent of flight altitude, and independent of weather, as SAR can select frequencies to avoid weather- caused signal attenuation. SAR has day and night imaging capability as illumination is provided by the SAR.Tomographic SAR. Gianfranco Fornaro. National Research Council (CNR).

University of Michigan. SAR images have wide applications in remote sensing and mapping of surfaces of the Earth and other planets. Applications of SAR include topography, oceanography, glaciology, geology (for example, terrain discrimination and subsurface imaging), and forestry, including forest height, biomass, deforestation. Volcano and earthquake monitoring use differential interferometry. SAR can also be applied for monitoring civil infrastructure stability such as bridges. SAR is useful in environment monitoring such as oil spills, flooding, urban growth, global change and military surveillance, including strategic policy and tactical assessment. SAR can be implemented as inverse SAR by observing a moving target over a substantial time with a stationary antenna. Basic principle The surface of Venus, as imaged by the Magellan probe using SAR A synthetic- aperture radar is an imaging radar mounted on a moving platform. Electromagnetic waves are transmitted sequentially, the echoes are collected and the system electronics digitizes and stores the data for subsequent processing. As transmission and reception occur at different times, they map to different positions. The well ordered combination of the received signals builds a virtual aperture that is much longer than the physical antenna width. That is the source of the term \\"synthetic aperture,\\" giving it the property of an imaging radar. The range direction is parallel to the flight track and perpendicular to the azimuth direction, which is also known as the along-track direction because it is in line with the position of the object within the antenna's field of view. Basic principle The 3D processing is done in two stages. The azimuth and range direction are focused for the generation of 2D (azimuth-range) high-resolution images, after which a digital elevation model (DEM) is used to measure the phase differences between complex images, which is determined from different look angles to recover the height information. This height information, along with the azimuth-range coordinates provided by 2-D SAR focusing, gives the third dimension, which is the elevation. The first step requires only standard processing algorithms,G. Fornaro, G. Franceschetti, \\"SAR Interferometry\\", Chapter IV in G. Franceschetti, R. Lanari, Synthetic Aperture Radar Processing, CRC-PRESS, Boca Raton, Marzo 1999. for the second step, additional pre-processing such as image co- registration and phase calibration is used. In addition, multiple baselines can be used to extend 3D imaging to the time dimension. 4D and multi-D SAR imaging allows imaging of complex scenarios, such as urban areas, and has improved performance with respect to classical interferometric techniques such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI). Algorithm The SAR algorithm, as given here, generally applies to phased arrays. A three-dimensional array (a volume) of scene elements is defined, which will represent the volume of space within which targets exist. Each element of the array is a cubical voxel representing the probability (a \\"density\\") of a reflective surface being at that location in space. (Note that two-dimensional SARs are also possible, showing only a top-down view of the target area.) Initially, the SAR algorithm gives each voxel a density of zero. Then for each captured waveform, the entire volume is iterated. For a given waveform and voxel, the distance from the position represented by that voxel to the antenna(s) used to capture that waveform is calculated. That distance represents a time delay into the waveform. The sample value at that position in the waveform is then added to the voxel's density value. This represents a possible echo from a target at that position. Note there are several optional approaches here, depending on the precision of the waveform timing, among other things. For example, if phase cannot be accurately determined, only the envelope magnitude (with the help of a Hilbert transform) of the waveform sample might be added to the voxel. If waveform polarization and phase are known and are accurate enough, then these values might be added to a more complex voxel that holds such measurements separately. After all waveforms have been iterated over all voxels, the basic SAR processing is complete. What remains, in the simplest approach, is to decide what voxel density value represents a solid object. Voxels whose density is below that threshold are ignored. Note the threshold level chosen must be higher than the peak energy of any single wave, otherwise that wave peak would appear as a sphere (or ellipse, in the case of multistatic operation) of false \\"density\\" across the entire volume. Thus to detect a point on a target, there must be at least two different antenna echoes from that point. Consequently, there is a need for large numbers of antenna positions to properly characterize a target. The voxels that passed the threshold criteria are visualized in 2D or 3D. Optionally, added visual quality can sometimes be had by use of a surface detection algorithm like marching cubes.Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imaging using the MIT IAP 2011 Laptop Based Radar, Presented at the 2011 MIT Independent Activities Period, 24 January 2011.University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, AZIMUTH STACKING ALGORITHM FOR SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR IMAGING, By Z.

Existing spectral estimation approaches  Synthetic-aperture radar determines the 3D reflectivity from measured SAR data. It is basically a spectrum estimation, because for a specific cell of an image, the complex-value SAR measurements of the SAR image stack are a sampled version of the Fourier transform of reflectivity in elevation direction, but the Fourier transform is irregular.Xiaoxiang Zhu, \\"Spectral Estimation for Synthetic Aperture Radar Tomography\\", Earth Oriented Space Science and Technology ‚Äì ESPACE, 19 September 2008. Thus the spectral estimation techniques are used to improve the resolution and reduce speckle compared to the results of conventional Fourier transform SAR imaging techniques.  Non- parametric methods  = FFT = FFT (i.e., periodogram or matched filter) is one such method, which is used in majority of the spectral estimation algorithms, and there are many fast algorithms for computing the multidimensional discrete Fourier transform. Computational Kronecker-core array algebra is a popular algorithm used as new variant of FFT algorithms for the processing in multidimensional synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) systems. This algorithm uses a study of theoretical properties of input/output data indexing sets and groups of permutations. A branch of finite multi-dimensional linear algebra is used to identify similarities and differences among various FFT algorithm variants and to create new variants. Each multidimensional DFT computation is expressed in matrix form. The multidimensional DFT matrix, in turn, is disintegrated into a set of factors, called functional primitives, which are individually identified with an underlying software/hardware computational design. The FFT implementation is essentially a realization of the mapping of the mathematical framework through generation of the variants and executing matrix operations. The performance of this implementation may vary from machine to machine, and the objective is to identify on which machine it performs best.  Advantages  * Additive group-theoretic properties of multidimensional input/output indexing sets are used for the mathematical formulations, therefore, it is easier to identify mapping between computing structures and mathematical expressions, thus, better than conventional methods. * The language of CKA algebra helps the application developer in understanding which are the more computational efficient FFT variants thus reducing the computational effort and improve their implementation time.  Disadvantages  * FFT cannot separate sinusoids close in frequency. If the periodicity of the data does not match FFT, edge effects are seen. = Capon method = The Capon spectral method, also called the minimum-variance method, is a multidimensional array-processing technique. It is a nonparametric covariance-based method, which uses an adaptive matched-filterbank approach and follows two main steps: # Passing the data through a 2D bandpass filter with varying center frequencies (\\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2). # Estimating the power at (\\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2) for all \\\\omega_1 \\\\in [0, 2\\\\pi), \\\\omega_2 \\\\in [0, 2\\\\pi) of interest from the filtered data. The adaptive Capon bandpass filter is designed to minimize the power of the filter output, as well as pass the frequencies (\\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2) without any attenuation, i.e., to satisfy, for each (\\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2), : \\\\min_h h^*_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} Rh_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} subject to h^*_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} a_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} = 1, where R is the covariance matrix, h^*_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} is the complex conjugate transpose of the impulse response of the FIR filter, a_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} is the 2D Fourier vector, defined as a_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} \\\\triangleq a_{\\\\omega_1} \\\\otimes a_{\\\\omega_2}, \\\\otimes denotes Kronecker product. Therefore, it passes a 2D sinusoid at a given frequency without distortion while minimizing the variance of the noise of the resulting image. The purpose is to compute the spectral estimate efficiently. Spectral estimate is given as : S_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} = \\\\frac{1}{a_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2}^* R^{-1} a_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2}}, where R is the covariance matrix, and a^*_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} is the 2D complex-conjugate transpose of the Fourier vector. The computation of this equation over all frequencies is time consuming. It is seen that the forward‚Äìbackward Capon estimator yields better estimation than the forward-only classical capon approach. The main reason behind this is that while the forward‚Äìbackward Capon uses both the forward and backward data vectors to obtain the estimate of the covariance matrix, the forward-only Capon uses only the forward data vectors to estimate the covariance matrix.  Advantages  * Capon can yield more accurate spectral estimates with much lower sidelobes and narrower spectral peaks than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. * Capon method can provide much better resolution.  Disadvantages  * Implementation requires computation of two intensive tasks: inversion of the covariance matrix R and multiplication by the a_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2} matrix, which has to be done for each point \\\\left(\\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2\\\\right). = APES method = The APES (amplitude and phase estimation) method is also a matched-filter-bank method, which assumes that the phase history data is a sum of 2D sinusoids in noise. APES spectral estimator has 2-step filtering interpretation: # Passing data through a bank of FIR bandpass filters with varying center frequency \\\\omega. # Obtaining the spectrum estimate for \\\\omega \\\\in [0, 2\\\\pi) from the filtered data.\\"Iterative realization of the 2-D Capon method applied in SAR image processing\\", IET International Radar Conference 2015. Empirically, the APES method results in wider spectral peaks than the Capon method, but more accurate spectral estimates for amplitude in SAR. In the Capon method, although the spectral peaks are narrower than the APES, the sidelobes are higher than that for the APES. As a result, the estimate for the amplitude is expected to be less accurate for the Capon method than for the APES method. The APES method requires about 1.5 times more computation than the Capon method.  Advantages  * Filtering reduces the number of available samples, but when it is designed tactically, the increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the filtered data will compensate this reduction, and the amplitude of a sinusoidal component with frequency \\\\omega can be estimated more accurately from the filtered data than from the original signal.  Disadvantages  * The autocovariance matrix is much larger in 2D than in 1D, therefore it is limited by memory available.  SAMV method  SAMV method is a parameter-free sparse signal reconstruction based algorithm. It achieves superresolution and robust to highly correlated signals. The name emphasizes its basis on the asymptotically minimum variance (AMV) criterion. It is a powerful tool for the recovery of both the amplitude and frequency characteristics of multiple highly correlated sources in challenging environment (e.g., limited number of snapshots, low signal-to-noise ratio. Applications include synthetic-aperture radar imaging and various source localization. = Advantages = SAMV method is capable of achieving resolution higher than some established parametric methods, e.g., MUSIC, especially with highly correlated signals. = Disadvantages = Computation complexity of the SAMV method is higher due to its iterative procedure.  Parametric subspace decomposition methods  = Eigenvector method = This subspace decomposition method separates the eigenvectors of the autocovariance matrix into those corresponding to signals and to clutter. The amplitude of the image at a point (\\\\omega_x, \\\\omega_y ) is given by: : \\\\hat{\\\\phi}_{EV}\\\\left(\\\\omega_x, \\\\omega_y\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1} {W^\\\\mathsf{H}\\\\left(\\\\omega_x, \\\\omega_y\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\sum_\\\\text{clutter} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_i} \\\\underline{v_i}\\\\,\\\\underline{v_i}^\\\\mathsf{H}\\\\right) W\\\\left(\\\\omega_x, \\\\omega_y\\\\right)} where \\\\hat{\\\\phi}_{EV} is the amplitude of the image at a point \\\\left(\\\\omega_x, \\\\omega_y\\\\right) , \\\\underline{v_i}is the coherency matrix and \\\\underline{v_i}^\\\\mathsf{H} is the Hermitian of the coherency matrix,\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_i} is the inverse of the eigenvalues of the clutter subspace, W\\\\left(\\\\omega_x, \\\\omega_y\\\\right) are vectors defined as : W\\\\left(\\\\omega_x, \\\\omega_y\\\\right) = \\\\left[1 \\\\exp\\\\left(-j\\\\omega_x\\\\right) \\\\ldots \\\\exp\\\\left(-j(M - 1)\\\\omega_x\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\otimes \\\\left[1 \\\\exp\\\\left(-j\\\\omega_y\\\\right) \\\\ldots \\\\exp\\\\left(-j(M - 1)\\\\omega_y\\\\right)\\\\right] where ‚äó denotes the Kronecker product of the two vectors.  Advantages  * Shows features of image more accurately.  Disadvantages  * High computational complexity. = MUSIC method = MUSIC detects frequencies in a signal by performing an eigen decomposition on the covariance matrix of a data vector of the samples obtained from the samples of the received signal. When all of the eigenvectors are included in the clutter subspace (model order = 0) the EV method becomes identical to the Capon method. Thus the determination of model order is critical to operation of the EV method. The eigenvalue of the R matrix decides whether its corresponding eigenvector corresponds to the clutter or to the signal subspace. The MUSIC method is considered to be a poor performer in SAR applications. This method uses a constant instead of the clutter subspace. In this method, the denominator is equated to zero when a sinusoidal signal corresponding to a point in the SAR image is in alignment to one of the signal subspace eigenvectors which is the peak in image estimate. Thus this method does not accurately represent the scattering intensity at each point, but show the particular points of the image.  Advantages  * MUSIC whitens or equalizes, the clutter eigenvalues.  Disadvantages  * Resolution loss due to the averaging operation.  Backprojection algorithm  Backprojection Algorithm has two methods: Time-domain Backprojection and Frequency-domain Backprojection. The time-domain Backprojection has more advantages over frequency-domain and thus, is more preferred. The time-domain Backprojection forms images or spectrums by matching the data acquired from the radar and as per what it expects to receive. It can be considered as an ideal matched-filter for synthetic-aperture radar. There is no need of having a different motion compensation step due to its quality of handling non-ideal motion/sampling. It can also be used for various imaging geometries. = Advantages = * It is invariant to the imaging mode: which means, that it uses the same algorithm irrespective of the imaging mode present, whereas, frequency domain methods require changes depending on the mode and geometry. * Ambiguous azimuth aliasing usually occurs when the Nyquist spatial sampling requirements are exceeded by frequencies. Unambiguous aliasing occurs in squinted geometries where the signal bandwidth does not exceed the sampling limits, but has undergone \\"spectral wrapping.\\" Backprojection Algorithm does not get affected by any such kind of aliasing effects. * It matches the space/time filter: uses the information about the imaging geometry, to produce a pixel-by-pixel varying matched filter to approximate the expected return signal. This usually yields antenna gain compensation. * With reference to the previous advantage, the back projection algorithm compensates for the motion. This becomes an advantage at areas having low altitudes. = Disadvantages = * The computational expense is more for Backprojection algorithm as compared to other frequency domain methods. * It requires very precise knowledge of imaging geometry. = Application: geosynchronous orbit synthetic-aperture radar (GEO-SAR) = In GEO-SAR, to focus specially on the relative moving track, the backprojection algorithm works very well. It uses the concept of Azimuth Processing in the time domain. For the satellite-ground geometry, GEO-SAR plays a significant role. The procedure of this concept is elaborated as follows. # The raw data acquired is segmented or drawn into sub- apertures for simplification of speedy conduction of procedure. # The range of the data is then compressed, using the concept of \\"Matched Filtering\\" for every segment/sub-aperture created. It is given by-s(t, \\\\tau) = \\\\exp \\\\left(-j \\\\cdot \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda} \\\\cdot R(t)\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{sinc}\\\\left(\\\\tau - \\\\frac{2}{c} \\\\cdot R(t)\\\\right) where œÑ is the range time, t is the azimuthal time, Œª is the wavelength, c is the speed of light. # Accuracy in the \\"Range Migration Curve\\" is achieved by range interpolation. # The pixel locations of the ground in the image is dependent on the satellite‚Äìground geometry model. Grid-division is now done as per the azimuth time. # Calculations for the \\"slant range\\" (range between the antenna's phase center and the point on the ground) are done for every azimuth time using coordinate transformations. # Azimuth Compression is done after the previous step. # Step 5 and 6 are repeated for every pixel, to cover every pixel, and conduct the procedure on every sub-aperture. # Lastly, all the sub- apertures of the image created throughout, are superimposed onto each other and the ultimate HD image is generated.  Comparison between the algorithms  Capon and APES can yield more accurate spectral estimates with much lower sidelobes and more narrow spectral peaks than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method, which is also a special case of the FIR filtering approaches. It is seen that although the APES algorithm gives slightly wider spectral peaks than the Capon method, the former yields more accurate overall spectral estimates than the latter and the FFT method. FFT method is fast and simple but have larger sidelobes. Capon has high resolution but high computational complexity. EV also has high resolution and high computational complexity. APES has higher resolution, faster than capon and EV but high computational complexity. MUSIC method is not generally suitable for SAR imaging, as whitening the clutter eigenvalues destroys the spatial inhomogeneities associated with terrain clutter or other diffuse scattering in SAR imagery. But it offers higher frequency resolution in the resulting power spectral density (PSD) than the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based methods. The backprojection algorithm is computationally expensive. It is specifically attractive for sensors that are wideband, wide-angle, and/or have long coherent apertures with substantial off-track motion. More complex operation The basic design of a synthetic-aperture radar system can be enhanced to collect more information. Most of these methods use the same basic principle of combining many pulses to form a synthetic aperture, but may involve additional antennas or significant additional processing. =Multistatic operation= SAR requires that echo captures be taken at multiple antenna positions. The more captures taken (at different antenna locations) the more reliable the target characterization. Multiple captures can be obtained by moving a single antenna to different locations, by placing multiple stationary antennas at different locations, or combinations thereof. The advantage of a single moving antenna is that it can be easily placed in any number of positions to provide any number of monostatic waveforms. For example, an antenna mounted on an airplane takes many captures per second as the plane travels. The principal advantages of multiple static antennas are that a moving target can be characterized (assuming the capture electronics are fast enough), that no vehicle or motion machinery is necessary, and that antenna positions need not be derived from other, sometimes unreliable, information. (One problem with SAR aboard an airplane is knowing precise antenna positions as the plane travels). For multiple static antennas, all combinations of monostatic and multistatic radar waveform captures are possible. Note, however, that it is not advantageous to capture a waveform for each of both transmission directions for a given pair of antennas, because those waveforms will be identical. When multiple static antennas are used, the total number of unique echo waveforms that can be captured is :\\\\frac{N^2 + N}{2} where N is the number of unique antenna positions.  Modes  = Stripmap mode airborne SAR = The antenna stays in a fixed position, and may be orthogonal to the flight path or squinted slightly forward or backward . When the antenna aperture travels along the flight path, a signal is transmitted at a rate equal to the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The lower boundary of the PRF is determined by the Doppler bandwidth of the radar. The backscatter of each of these signals is commutatively added on a pixel-by-pixel basis to attain the fine azimuth resolution desired in radar imagery.Mark T. Crockett, \\"An Introduction to Synthetic Aperture Radar:A High-Resolution Alternative to Optical Imaging\\" Illustration of the SAR stripmap operation mode. = Spotlight mode SAR = The spotlight synthetic aperture is given by : Lsa = r_0 \\\\Delta\\\\theta_a where \\\\Delta\\\\theta_a is the angle formed between the beginning and end of the imaging, as shown in the diagram of spotlight imaging and r_0 is the range distance. Depiction of the Spotlight Image Mode The spotlight mode gives better resolution albeit for a smaller ground patch. In this mode, the illuminating radar beam is steered continually as the aircraft moves, so that it illuminates the same patch over a longer period of time. This mode is not a traditional continuous-strip imaging mode; however, it has high azimuth resolution. = Scan mode SAR = While operating as a scan mode SAR, the antenna beam sweeps periodically and thus cover much larger area than the spotlight and stripmap modes. However, the azimuth resolution become much lower than the stripmap mode due to the decreased azimuth bandwidth. Clearly there is a balance achieved between the azimuth resolution and the scan area of SAR.C. Romero, High Resolution Simulation of Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging. 2010. [Online]. Available: http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1364&context;=theses. Accessed: 14 November 2016. Here, the synthetic aperture is shared between the sub swaths, and it is not in direct contact within one subswath. Mosaic operation is required in azimuth and range directions to join the azimuth bursts and the range sub-swaths. Depiction of ScanSAR Imaging Mode  Properties  * ScanSAR makes the swath beam huge. * The azimuth signal has many bursts. * The azimuth resolution is limited due to the burst duration. * Each target contains varied frequencies which completely depends on where the azimuth is present. Polarimetry SAR image of Death Valley colored using polarimetry Radar waves have a polarization. Different materials reflect radar waves with different intensities, but anisotropic materials such as grass often reflect different polarizations with different intensities. Some materials will also convert one polarization into another. By emitting a mixture of polarizations and using receiving antennas with a specific polarization, several images can be collected from the same series of pulses. Frequently three such RX-TX polarizations (HH-pol, VV-pol, VH-pol) are used as the three color channels in a synthesized image. This is what has been done in the picture at right. Interpretation of the resulting colors requires significant testing of known materials. New developments in polarimetry include using the changes in the random polarization returns of some surfaces (such as grass or sand) and between two images of the same location at different times to determine where changes not visible to optical systems occurred. Examples include subterranean tunneling or paths of vehicles driving through the area being imaged. Enhanced SAR sea oil slick observation has been developed by appropriate physical modelling and use of fully polarimetric and dual-polarimetric measurements. SAR polarimetry is a technique used for deriving qualitative and quantitative physical information for land, snow and ice, ocean and urban applications based on the measurement and exploration of the polarimetric properties of man-made and natural scatterers. Terrain and land use classification is one of the most important applications of polarimetric synthetic-aperture radar (POLSAR). SAR polarimetry uses a scattering matrix (S) to identify the scattering behavior of objects after an interaction with electromagnetic wave. The matrix is represented by a combination of horizontal and vertical polarization states of transmitted and received signals. S = \\\\begin{bmatrix} S_{HH} & S_{HV} \\\\ S_{VH} & S_{VV} \\\\end{bmatrix} where, HH is for horizontal transmit and horizontal receive, VV is for vertical transmit and vertical receive, HV is for horizontal transmit and vertical receive, and VH ‚Äì for vertical transmit and horizontal receive. The first two of these polarization combinations are referred to as like- polarized (or co-polarized), because the transmit and receive polarizations are the same. The last two combinations are referred to as cross-polarized because the transmit and receive polarizations are orthogonal to one another.Woodhouse, H.I. 2009. Introduction to microwave remote sensing. CRC Press, Taylor & Fancis Group, Special Indian Edition. The three-component scattering power model by Freeman and Durden is successfully used for decomposition of POLSAR image, applying the reflection symmetry condition using covariance matrix. The method is based on simple physical scattering mechanisms (surface scattering, double-bounce scattering, and volume scattering). The advantage of this scattering model is that it is simple and easy to implement for image processing. There are 2 major approaches for a 3\\\\times3 polarimetric matrix decomposition. One is the lexicographic covariance matrix approach based on physically measurable parameters, and the other is the Pauli decomposition which is a coherent decomposition matrix. It represents all the polarimetric information in a single SAR image. The polarimetric information of [S] could be represented by the combination of the intensities S_{HH}^2 , S_{VV}^2 , 2S_{HV}^2 in a single RGB image where all the previous intensities will be coded as a color channel. For PolSAR image analysis, there can be cases where reflection symmetry condition does not hold. In those cases a four-component scattering model can be used to decompose polarimetric synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images. This approach deals with the non- reflection symmetric scattering case. It includes and extends the three-component decomposition method introduced by Freeman and Durden to a fourth component by adding the helix scattering power. This helix power term generally appears in complex urban area but disappears for a natural distributed scatterer. There is also an improved method using the four-component decomposition algorithm, which was introduced for the general POLSAR data image analyses. The SAR data is first filtered which is known as speckle reduction, then each pixel is decomposed by four-component model to determine the surface scattering power (P_{s}), double-bounce scattering power (P_{d}), volume scattering power (P_{v}), and helix scattering power (P_{c}). The pixels are then divided into 5 classes (surface,double- bounce,volume,helix,and mixed pixels) classified with respect to maximum powers. A mixed category is added for the pixels having two or three equal dominant scattering powers after computation. The process continues as the pixels in all these categories are divided in 20 small clutter approximately of same number of pixels and merged as desirable, this is called cluster merging. They are iteratively classified and then automatically color is delivered to each class. The summarization of this algorithm leads to an understanding that, brown colors denotes the surface scattering classes, red colors for double-bounce scattering classes, green colors for volume scattering classes, and blue colors for helix scattering classes. Color representation of different polarizations. Although this method is aimed for non-reflection case, it automatically includes the reflection symmetry condition, therefore in can be used as a general case. It also preserves the scattering characteristics by taking the mixed scattering category into account therefore proving to be a better algorithm. Interferometry Rather than discarding the phase data, information can be extracted from it. If two observations of the same terrain from very similar positions are available, aperture synthesis can be performed to provide the resolution performance which would be given by a radar system with dimensions equal to the separation of the two measurements. This technique is called interferometric SAR or InSAR. If the two samples are obtained simultaneously (perhaps by placing two antennas on the same aircraft, some distance apart), then any phase difference will contain information about the angle from which the radar echo returned. Combining this with the distance information, one can determine the position in three dimensions of the image pixel. In other words, one can extract terrain altitude as well as radar reflectivity, producing a digital elevation model (DEM) with a single airplane pass. One aircraft application at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing produced digital elevation maps with a resolution of 5 m and altitude errors also about 5 m. Interferometry was used to map many regions of the Earth's surface with unprecedented accuracy using data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. If the two samples are separated in time, perhaps from two flights over the same terrain, then there are two possible sources of phase shift. The first is terrain altitude, as discussed above. The second is terrain motion: if the terrain has shifted between observations, it will return a different phase. The amount of shift required to cause a significant phase difference is on the order of the wavelength used. This means that if the terrain shifts by centimeters, it can be seen in the resulting image (a digital elevation map must be available to separate the two kinds of phase difference; a third pass may be necessary to produce one). This second method offers a powerful tool in geology and geography. Glacier flow can be mapped with two passes. Maps showing the land deformation after a minor earthquake or after a volcanic eruption (showing the shrinkage of the whole volcano by several centimeters) have been published https://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/animation/volcano_monitoring_using_insar_to_see_changes_in_volcano_shape. =Differential interferometry= Differential interferometry (D-InSAR) requires taking at least two images with addition of a DEM. The DEM can be either produced by GPS measurements or could be generated by interferometry as long as the time between acquisition of the image pairs is short, which guarantees minimal distortion of the image of the target surface. In principle, 3 images of the ground area with similar image acquisition geometry is often adequate for D-InSar. The principle for detecting ground movement is quite simple. One interferogram is created from the first two images; this is also called the reference interferogram or topographical interferogram. A second interferogram is created that captures topography + distortion. Subtracting the latter from the reference interferogram can reveal differential fringes, indicating movement. The described 3 image D-InSAR generation technique is called 3-pass or double-difference method. Differential fringes which remain as fringes in the differential interferogram are a result of SAR range changes of any displaced point on the ground from one interferogram to the next. In the differential interferogram, each fringe is directly proportional to the SAR wavelength, which is about 5.6 cm for ERS and RADARSAT single phase cycle. Surface displacement away from the satellite look direction causes an increase in path (translating to phase) difference. Since the signal travels from the SAR antenna to the target and back again, the measured displacement is twice the unit of wavelength. This means in differential interferometry one fringe cycle ‚àí to + or one wavelength corresponds to a displacement relative to SAR antenna of only half wavelength (2.8 cm). There are various publications on measuring subsidence movement, slope stability analysis, landslide, glacier movement, etc. tooling D-InSAR. Further advancement to this technique whereby differential interferometry from satellite SAR ascending pass and descending pass can be used to estimate 3-D ground movement. Research in this area has shown accurate measurements of 3-D ground movement with accuracies comparable to GPS based measurements can be achieved. = Tomo-SAR = SAR Tomography is a subfield of a concept named as multi-baseline interferometry. It has been developed to give a 3D exposure to the imaging, which uses the beam formation concept. It can be used when the use demands a focused phase concern between the magnitude and the phase components of the SAR data, during information retrieval. One of the major advantages of Tomo-SAR is that it can separate out the parameters which get scattered, irrespective of how different their motions are. On using Tomo-SAR with differential interferometry, a new combination named \\"differential tomography\\" (Diff-Tomo) is developed.  Application of Tomo-SAR  Tomo-SAR has an application based on radar imaging, which is the depiction of Ice Volume and Forest Temporal Coherence (Temporal coherence describes the correlation between waves observed at different moments in time). Ultra- wideband SAR Conventional radar systems emit bursts of radio energy with a fairly narrow range of frequencies. A narrow-band channel, by definition, does not allow rapid changes in modulation. Since it is the change in a received signal that reveals the time of arrival of the signal (obviously an unchanging signal would reveal nothing about \\"when\\" it reflected from the target), a signal with only a slow change in modulation cannot reveal the distance to the target as well as a signal with a quick change in modulation. Ultra-wideband (UWB) refers to any radio transmission that uses a very large bandwidth ‚Äì which is the same as saying it uses very rapid changes in modulation. Although there is no set bandwidth value that qualifies a signal as \\"UWB\\", systems using bandwidths greater than a sizable portion of the center frequency (typically about ten percent, or so) are most often called \\"UWB\\" systems. A typical UWB system might use a bandwidth of one-third to one-half of its center frequency. For example, some systems use a bandwidth of about 1 GHz centered around 3 GHz. There are as many ways to increase the bandwidth of a signal as there are forms of modulation ‚Äì it is simply a matter of increasing the rate of that modulation. However, the two most common methods used in UWB radar, including SAR, are very short pulses and high-bandwidth chirping. A general description of chirping appears elsewhere in this article. The bandwidth of a chirped system can be as narrow or as wide as the designers desire. Pulse-based UWB systems, being the more common method associated with the term \\"UWB radar\\", are described here. A pulse-based radar system transmits very short pulses of electromagnetic energy, typically only a few waves or less. A very short pulse is, of course, a very rapidly changing signal, and thus occupies a very wide bandwidth. This allows far more accurate measurement of distance, and thus resolution. The main disadvantage of pulse-based UWB SAR is that the transmitting and receiving front-end electronics are difficult to design for high-power applications. Specifically, the transmit duty cycle is so exceptionally low and pulse time so exceptionally short, that the electronics must be capable of extremely high instantaneous power to rival the average power of conventional radars. (Although it is true that UWB provides a notable gain in channel capacity over a narrow band signal because of the relationship of bandwidth in the Shannon‚ÄìHartley theorem and because the low receive duty cycle receives less noise, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, there is still a notable disparity in link budget because conventional radar might be several orders of magnitude more powerful than a typical pulse-based radar.) So pulse-based UWB SAR is typically used in applications requiring average power levels in the microwatt or milliwatt range, and thus is used for scanning smaller, nearer target areas (several tens of meters), or in cases where lengthy integration (over a span of minutes) of the received signal is possible. Note, however, that this limitation is solved in chirped UWB radar systems. The principal advantages of UWB radar are better resolution (a few millimeters using commercial off-the-shelf electronics) and more spectral information of target reflectivity. Doppler-beam sharpening Doppler Beam Sharpening commonly refers to the method of processing unfocused real-beam phase history to achieve better resolution than could be achieved by processing the real beam without it. Because the real aperture of the radar antenna is so small (compared to the wavelength in use), the radar energy spreads over a wide area (usually many degrees wide in a direction orthogonal (at right angles) to the direction of the platform (aircraft)). Doppler-beam sharpening takes advantage of the motion of the platform in that targets ahead of the platform return a Doppler upshifted signal (slightly higher in frequency) and targets behind the platform return a Doppler downshifted signal (slightly lower in frequency). The amount of shift varies with the angle forward or backward from the ortho-normal direction. By knowing the speed of the platform, target signal return is placed in a specific angle \\"bin\\" that changes over time. Signals are integrated over time and thus the radar \\"beam\\" is synthetically reduced to a much smaller aperture ‚Äì or more accurately (and based on the ability to distinguish smaller Doppler shifts) the system can have hundreds of very \\"tight\\" beams concurrently. This technique dramatically improves angular resolution; however, it is far more difficult to take advantage of this technique for range resolution. (See pulse-doppler radar). Chirped (pulse-compressed) radars A common technique for many radar systems (usually also found in SAR systems) is to \\"chirp\\" the signal. In a \\"chirped\\" radar, the pulse is allowed to be much longer. A longer pulse allows more energy to be emitted, and hence received, but usually hinders range resolution. But in a chirped radar, this longer pulse also has a frequency shift during the pulse (hence the chirp or frequency shift). When the \\"chirped\\" signal is returned, it must be correlated with the sent pulse. Classically, in analog systems, it is passed to a dispersive delay line (often a surface acoustic wave device) that has the property of varying velocity of propagation based on frequency. This technique \\"compresses\\" the pulse in time ‚Äì thus having the effect of a much shorter pulse (improved range resolution) while having the benefit of longer pulse length (much more signal returned). Newer systems use digital pulse correlation to find the pulse return in the signal. Typical operation NASA's AirSAR instrument is attached to the side of a DC-8 In a typical SAR application, a single radar antenna is attached to an aircraft or spacecraft such that a substantial component of the antenna's radiated beam has a wave-propagation direction perpendicular to the flight- path direction. The beam is allowed to be broad in the vertical direction so it will illuminate the terrain from nearly beneath the aircraft out toward the horizon. Resolution in the range dimension of the image is accomplished by creating pulses which define very short time intervals, either by emitting short pulses consisting of a carrier frequency and the necessary sidebands, all within a certain bandwidth, or by using longer \\"chirp pulses\\" in which frequency varies (often linearly) with time within that bandwidth. The differing times at which echoes return allow points at different distances to be distinguished. SAR antenna of the SAOCOM satellites. The total signal is that from a beamwidth-sized patch of the ground. To produce a beam that is narrow in the cross-range direction, diffraction effects require that the antenna be wide in that dimension. Therefore, the distinguishing, from each other, of co-range points simply by strengths of returns that persist for as long as they are within the beam width is difficult with aircraft-carryable antennas, because their beams can have linear widths only about two orders of magnitude (hundreds of times) smaller than the range. (Spacecraft-carryable ones can do 10 or more times better.) However, if both the amplitude and the phase of returns are recorded, then the portion of that multi-target return that was scattered radially from any smaller scene element can be extracted by phase-vector correlation of the total return with the form of the return expected from each such element. Careful design and operation can accomplish resolution of items smaller than a millionth of the range, for example, 30 cm at 300 km, or about one foot at nearly . The process can be thought of as combining the series of spatially distributed observations as if all had been made simultaneously with an antenna as long as the beamwidth and focused on that particular point. The \\"synthetic aperture\\" simulated at maximum system range by this process not only is longer than the real antenna, but, in practical applications, it is much longer than the radar aircraft, and tremendously longer than the radar spacecraft. Image resolution of SAR in its range coordinate (expressed in image pixels per distance unit) is mainly proportional to the radio bandwidth of whatever type of pulse is used. In the cross-range coordinate, the similar resolution is mainly proportional to the bandwidth of the Doppler shift of the signal returns within the beamwidth. Since Doppler frequency depends on the angle of the scattering point's direction from the broadside direction, the Doppler bandwidth available within the beamwidth is the same at all ranges. Hence the theoretical spatial resolution limits in both image dimensions remain constant with variation of range. However, in practice, both the errors that accumulate with data- collection time and the particular techniques used in post-processing further limit cross-range resolution at long ranges. The conversion of return delay time to geometric range can be very accurate because of the natural constancy of the speed and direction of propagation of electromagnetic waves. However, for an aircraft flying through the never-uniform and never-quiescent atmosphere, the relating of pulse transmission and reception times to successive geometric positions of the antenna must be accompanied by constant adjusting of the return phases to account for sensed irregularities in the flight path. SAR's in spacecraft avoid that atmosphere problem, but still must make corrections for known antenna movements due to rotations of the spacecraft, even those that are reactions to movements of onboard machinery. Locating a SAR in a manned space vehicle may require that the humans carefully remain motionless relative to the vehicle during data collection periods. Although some references to SARs have characterized them as \\"radar telescopes\\", their actual optical analogy is the microscope, the detail in their images being smaller than the length of the synthetic aperture. In radar-engineering terms, while the target area is in the \\"far field\\" of the illuminating antenna, it is in the \\"near field\\" of the simulated one. Returns from scatterers within the range extent of any image are spread over a matching time interval. The inter-pulse period must be long enough to allow farthest-range returns from any pulse to finish arriving before the nearest- range ones from the next pulse begin to appear, so that those do not overlap each other in time. On the other hand, the interpulse rate must be fast enough to provide sufficient samples for the desired across-range (or across-beam) resolution. When the radar is to be carried by a high-speed vehicle and is to image a large area at fine resolution, those conditions may clash, leading to what has been called SAR's ambiguity problem. The same considerations apply to \\"conventional\\" radars also, but this problem occurs significantly only when resolution is so fine as to be available only through SAR processes. Since the basis of the problem is the information-carrying capacity of the single signal-input channel provided by one antenna, the only solution is to use additional channels fed by additional antennas. The system then becomes a hybrid of a SAR and a phased array, sometimes being called a Vernier array. Combining the series of observations requires significant computational resources, usually using Fourier transform techniques. The high digital computing speed now available allows such processing to be done in near-real time on board a SAR aircraft. (There is necessarily a minimum time delay until all parts of the signal have been received.) The result is a map of radar reflectivity, including both amplitude and phase. The amplitude information, when shown in a map-like display, gives information about ground cover in much the same way that a black-and-white photo does. Variations in processing may also be done in either vehicle-borne stations or ground stations for various purposes, so as to accentuate certain image features for detailed target-area analysis. Although the phase information in an image is generally not made available to a human observer of an image display device, it can be preserved numerically, and sometimes allows certain additional features of targets to be recognized. Unfortunately, the phase differences between adjacent image picture elements (\\"pixels\\") also produce random interference effects called \\"coherence speckle\\", which is a sort of graininess with dimensions on the order of the resolution, causing the concept of resolution to take on a subtly different meaning. This effect is the same as is apparent both visually and photographically in laser-illuminated optical scenes. The scale of that random speckle structure is governed by the size of the synthetic aperture in wavelengths, and cannot be finer than the system's resolution. Speckle structure can be subdued at the expense of resolution. Before rapid digital computers were available, the data processing was done using an optical holography technique. The analog radar data were recorded as a holographic interference pattern on photographic film at a scale permitting the film to preserve the signal bandwidths (for example, 1:1,000,000 for a radar using a 0.6-meter wavelength). Then light using, for example, 0.6-micrometer waves (as from a helium‚Äìneon laser) passing through the hologram could project a terrain image at a scale recordable on another film at reasonable processor focal distances of around a meter. This worked because both SAR and phased arrays are fundamentally similar to optical holography, but using microwaves instead of light waves. The \\"optical data-processors\\" developed for this radar purpose\\"Synthetic Aperture Radar\\", L. J. Cutrona, Chapter 23 (25 pp) of the McGraw Hill \\"Radar Handbook\\", 1970. (Written while optical data processing was still the only workable method, by the person who first led that development.)\\"A short history of the Optics Group of the Willow Run Laboratories\\", Emmett N. Leith, in Trends in Optics: Research, Development, and Applications (book), Anna Consortini, Academic Press, San Diego: 1996.\\"Sighted Automation and Fine Resolution Imaging\\", W. M. Brown, J. L. Walker, and W. R. Boario, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Vol. 40, No. 4, October 2004, pp 1426‚Äì1445. were the first effective analog optical computer systems, and were, in fact, devised before the holographic technique was fully adapted to optical imaging. Because of the different sources of range and across-range signal structures in the radar signals, optical data-processors for SAR included not only both spherical and cylindrical lenses, but sometimes conical ones. Image appearance The following considerations apply also to real-aperture terrain-imaging radars, but are more consequential when resolution in range is matched to a cross-beam resolution that is available only from a SAR. The two dimensions of a radar image are range and cross-range. Radar images of limited patches of terrain can resemble oblique photographs, but not ones taken from the location of the radar. This is because the range coordinate in a radar image is perpendicular to the vertical-angle coordinate of an oblique photo. The apparent entrance- pupil position (or camera center) for viewing such an image is therefore not as if at the radar, but as if at a point from which the viewer's line of sight is perpendicular to the slant-range direction connecting radar and target, with slant-range increasing from top to bottom of the image. Because slant ranges to level terrain vary in vertical angle, each elevation of such terrain appears as a curved surface, specifically a hyperbolic cosine one. Verticals at various ranges are perpendiculars to those curves. The viewer's apparent looking directions are parallel to the curve's \\"hypcos\\" axis. Items directly beneath the radar appear as if optically viewed horizontally (i.e., from the side) and those at far ranges as if optically viewed from directly above. These curvatures are not evident unless large extents of near-range terrain, including steep slant ranges, are being viewed. When viewed as specified above, fine-resolution radar images of small areas can appear most nearly like familiar optical ones, for two reasons. The first reason is easily understood by imagining a flagpole in the scene. The slant-range to its upper end is less than that to its base. Therefore, the pole can appear correctly top-end up only when viewed in the above orientation. Secondly, the radar illumination then being downward, shadows are seen in their most-familiar \\"overhead- lighting\\" direction. Note that the image of the pole's top will overlay that of some terrain point which is on the same slant range arc but at a shorter horizontal range (\\"ground-range\\"). Images of scene surfaces which faced both the illumination and the apparent eyepoint will have geometries that resemble those of an optical scene viewed from that eyepoint. However, slopes facing the radar will be foreshortened and ones facing away from it will be lengthened from their horizontal (map) dimensions. The former will therefore be brightened and the latter dimmed. Returns from slopes steeper than perpendicular to slant range will be overlaid on those of lower-elevation terrain at a nearer ground-range, both being visible but intermingled. This is especially the case for vertical surfaces like the walls of buildings. Another viewing inconvenience that arises when a surface is steeper than perpendicular to the slant range is that it is then illuminated on one face but \\"viewed\\" from the reverse face. Then one \\"sees\\", for example, the radar-facing wall of a building as if from the inside, while the building's interior and the rear wall (that nearest to, hence expected to be optically visible to, the viewer) have vanished, since they lack illumination, being in the shadow of the front wall and the roof. Some return from the roof may overlay that from the front wall, and both of those may overlay return from terrain in front of the building. The visible building shadow will include those of all illuminated items. Long shadows may exhibit blurred edges due to the illuminating antenna's movement during the \\"time exposure\\" needed to create the image. Surfaces that we usually consider rough will, if that roughness consists of relief less than the radar wavelength, behave as smooth mirrors, showing, beyond such a surface, additional images of items in front of it. Those mirror images will appear within the shadow of the mirroring surface, sometimes filling the entire shadow, thus preventing recognition of the shadow. An important fact that applies to SARs but not to real-aperture radars is that the direction of overlay of any scene point is not directly toward the radar, but toward that point of the SAR's current path direction that is nearest to the target point. If the SAR is \\"squinting\\" forward or aft away from the exactly broadside direction, then the illumination direction, and hence the shadow direction, will not be opposite to the overlay direction, but slanted to right or left from it. An image will appear with the correct projection geometry when viewed so that the overlay direction is vertical, the SAR's flight-path is above the image, and range increases somewhat downward. Objects in motion within a SAR scene alter the Doppler frequencies of the returns. Such objects therefore appear in the image at locations offset in the across- range direction by amounts proportional to the range-direction component of their velocity. Road vehicles may be depicted off the roadway and therefore not recognized as road traffic items. Trains appearing away from their tracks are more easily properly recognized by their length parallel to known trackage as well as by the absence of an equal length of railbed signature and of some adjacent terrain, both having been shadowed by the train. While images of moving vessels can be offset from the line of the earlier parts of their wakes, the more recent parts of the wake, which still partake of some of the vessel's motion, appear as curves connecting the vessel image to the relatively quiescent far-aft wake. In such identifiable cases, speed and direction of the moving items can be determined from the amounts of their offsets. The along-track component of a target's motion causes some defocus. Random motions such as that of wind-driven tree foliage, vehicles driven over rough terrain, or humans or other animals walking or running generally render those items not focusable, resulting in blurring or even effective invisibility. These considerations, along with the speckle structure due to coherence, take some getting used to in order to correctly interpret SAR images. To assist in that, large collections of significant target signatures have been accumulated by performing many test flights over known terrains and cultural objects. History Carl A.

A. Wiley, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, v.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Goodyear Aircraft (later Goodyear Aerospace) introduced numerous advancements in SAR technology, many with the help from Don Beckerleg.Gart, Jason H. \\"Electronics and Aerospace Industry in Cold War Arizona, 1945‚Äì1968: Motorola, Hughes Aircraft, Goodyear Aircraft.\\" Phd diss., Arizona State University, 2006. Independently of Wiley's work, experimental trials in early 1952 by Sherwin and others at the University of Illinois' Control Systems Laboratory showed results that they pointed out \\"could provide the basis for radar systems with greatly improved angular resolution\\" and might even lead to systems capable of focusing at all ranges simultaneously.\\"Some Early Developments in Synthetic Aperture Radar Systems\\", C. W. Sherwin, J. P. Ruina, and R. D. Rawcliffe, IRE Transactions on Military Electronics, April 1962, pp. 111‚Äì115. In both of those programs, processing of the radar returns was done by electrical-circuit filtering methods. In essence, signal strength in isolated discrete bands of Doppler frequency defined image intensities that were displayed at matching angular positions within proper range locations. When only the central (zero-Doppler band) portion of the return signals was used, the effect was as if only that central part of the beam existed. That led to the term Doppler Beam Sharpening. Displaying returns from several adjacent non-zero Doppler frequency bands accomplished further \\"beam-subdividing\\" (sometimes called \\"unfocused radar\\", though it could have been considered \\"semi-focused\\"). Wiley's patent, applied for in 1954, still proposed similar processing. The bulkiness of the circuitry then available limited the extent to which those schemes might further improve resolution.

In that same year, the Illinois group produced a \\"strip-map\\" image exhibiting a considerable amount of sub-beamwidth resolution. A more advanced focused-radar project was among several remote sensing schemes assigned in 1953 to Project Michigan, a tri-service-sponsored (Army, Navy, Air Force) program at the University of Michigan's Willow Run Research Center (WRRC), that program being administered by the Army Signal Corps. Initially called the side-looking radar project, it was carried out by a group first known as the Radar Laboratory and later as the Radar and Optics Laboratory. It proposed to take into account, not just the short-term existence of several particular Doppler shifts, but the entire history of the steadily varying shifts from each target as the latter crossed the beam. An early analysis by Dr. Louis J. Cutrona, Weston E. Vivian, and Emmett N. Leith of that group showed that such a fully focused system should yield, at all ranges, a resolution equal to the width (or, by some criteria, the half-width) of the real antenna carried on the radar aircraft and continually pointed broadside to the aircraft's path.\\"A Doppler Technique for Obtaining Very Fine Angular Resolution from a Side-Looking Airborne Radar\\" Report of Project Michigan No. 2144-5-T, The University of Michigan, Willow Run Research Center, July 1954. (No declassified copy of this historic originally confidential report has yet been located.) The required data processing amounted to calculating cross- correlations of the received signals with samples of the forms of signals to be expected from unit-amplitude sources at the various ranges. At that time, even large digital computers had capabilities somewhat near the levels of today's four-function handheld calculators, hence were nowhere near able to do such a huge amount of computation. Instead, the device for doing the correlation computations was to be an optical correlator. It was proposed that signals received by the traveling antenna and coherently detected be displayed as a single range-trace line across the diameter of the face of a cathode-ray tube, the line's successive forms being recorded as images projected onto a film traveling perpendicular to the length of that line. The information on the developed film was to be subsequently processed in the laboratory on equipment still to be devised as a principal task of the project. In the initial processor proposal, an arrangement of lenses was expected to multiply the recorded signals point-by-point with the known signal forms by passing light successively through both the signal film and another film containing the known signal pattern. The subsequent summation, or integration, step of the correlation was to be done by converging appropriate sets of multiplication products by the focusing action of one or more spherical and cylindrical lenses. The processor was to be, in effect, an optical analog computer performing large-scale scalar arithmetic calculations in many channels (with many light \\"rays\\") at once. Ultimately, two such devices would be needed, their outputs to be combined as quadrature components of the complete solution. Fortunately (as it turned out), a desire to keep the equipment small had led to recording the reference pattern on 35 mm film. Trials promptly showed that the patterns on the film were so fine as to show pronounced diffraction effects that prevented sharp final focusing. That led Leith, a physicist who was devising the correlator, to recognize that those effects in themselves could, by natural processes, perform a significant part of the needed processing, since along-track strips of the recording operated like diametrical slices of a series of circular optical zone plates. Any such plate performs somewhat like a lens, each plate having a specific focal length for any given wavelength. The recording that had been considered as scalar became recognized as pairs of opposite-sign vector ones of many spatial frequencies plus a zero-frequency \\"bias\\" quantity. The needed correlation summation changed from a pair of scalar ones to a single vector one. Each zone plate strip has two equal but oppositely signed focal lengths, one real, where a beam through it converges to a focus, and one virtual, where another beam appears to have diverged from, beyond the other face of the zone plate. The zero-frequency (DC bias) component has no focal point, but overlays both the converging and diverging beams. The key to obtaining, from the converging wave component, focused images that are not overlaid with unwanted haze from the other two is to block the latter, allowing only the wanted beam to pass through a properly positioned frequency-band selecting aperture. Each radar range yields a zone plate strip with a focal length proportional to that range. This fact became a principal complication in the design of optical processors. Consequently, technical journals of the time contain a large volume of material devoted to ways for coping with the variation of focus with range. For that major change in approach, the light used had to be both monochromatic and coherent, properties that were already a requirement on the radar radiation. Lasers also then being in the future, the best then-available approximation to a coherent light source was the output of a mercury vapor lamp, passed through a color filter that was matched to the lamp spectrum's green band, and then concentrated as well as possible onto a very small beam- limiting aperture. While the resulting amount of light was so weak that very long exposure times had to be used, a workable optical correlator was assembled in time to be used when appropriate data became available. Although creating that radar was a more straightforward task based on already-known techniques, that work did demand the achievement of signal linearity and frequency stability that were at the extreme state of the art. An adequate instrument was designed and built by the Radar Laboratory and was installed in a C-46 (Curtiss Commando) aircraft. Because the aircraft was bailed to WRRC by the U. S. Army and was flown and maintained by WRRC's own pilots and ground personnel, it was available for many flights at times matching the Radar Laboratory's needs, a feature important for allowing frequent re-testing and \\"debugging\\" of the continually developing complex equipment. By contrast, the Illinois group had used a C-46 belonging to the Air Force and flown by AF pilots only by pre-arrangement, resulting, in the eyes of those researchers, in limitation to a less-than-desirable frequency of flight tests of their equipment, hence a low bandwidth of feedback from tests. (Later work with newer Convair aircraft continued the Michigan group's local control of flight schedules.) Michigan's chosen -wide World War II-surplus antenna was theoretically capable of resolution, but data from only 10% of the beamwidth was used at first, the goal at that time being to demonstrate resolution. It was understood that finer resolution would require the added development of means for sensing departures of the aircraft from an ideal heading and flight path, and for using that information for making needed corrections to the antenna pointing and to the received signals before processing. After numerous trials in which even small atmospheric turbulence kept the aircraft from flying straight and level enough for good data, one pre-dawn flight in August 1957\\"High-Resolution Radar Achievements During Preliminary Flight Tests\\", W. A. Blikken and G.O. Hall, Institute of Science and Technology, Univ. of Michigan, 1 September 1957. Defense Technical Information Center (Document AD148507) yielded a map-like image of the Willow Run Airport area which did demonstrate resolution in some parts of the image, whereas the illuminated beam width there was . Although the program had been considered for termination by DoD due to what had seemed to be a lack of results, that first success ensured further funding to continue development leading to solutions to those recognized needs.

The SAR principle was first acknowledged publicly via an April 1960 press release about the U. S. Army experimental AN/UPD-1 system, which consisted of an airborne element made by Texas Instruments and installed in a Beech L-23D aircraft and a mobile ground data- processing station made by WRRC and installed in a military van. At the time, the nature of the data processor was not revealed. A technical article in the journal of the IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers) Professional Group on Military Electronics in February 1961\\"A High-Resolution Radar Combat- Intelligence System\\", L. J. Cutrona, W. E. Vivian, E. N. Leith, and G. O Hall; IRE Transactions on Military Electronics, April 1961, pp 127‚Äì131 described the SAR principle and both the C-46 and AN/UPD-1 versions, but did not tell how the data were processed, nor that the UPD-1's maximum resolution capability was about . However, the June 1960 issue of the IRE Professional Group on Information Theory had contained a long article\\"Optical Data Processing and Filtering Systems\\", L. J. Cutrona, E. N. Leith, C. J. Palermo, and L. J. Porcello; IRE Transactions on Information Theory, June 1960, pp 386‚Äì400. on \\"Optical Data Processing and Filtering Systems\\" by members of the Michigan group. Although it did not refer to the use of those techniques for radar, readers of both journals could quite easily understand the existence of a connection between articles sharing some authors. An operational system to be carried in a reconnaissance version of the F-4 \\"Phantom\\" aircraft was quickly devised and was used briefly in Vietnam, where it failed to favorably impress its users, due to the combination of its low resolution (similar to the UPD-1's), the speckly nature of its coherent-wave images (similar to the speckliness of laser images), and the poorly understood dissimilarity of its range/cross-range images from the angle/angle optical ones familiar to military photo interpreters. The lessons it provided were well learned by subsequent researchers, operational system designers, image-interpreter trainers, and the DoD sponsors of further development and acquisition. In subsequent work the technique's latent capability was eventually achieved. That work, depending on advanced radar circuit designs and precision sensing of departures from ideal straight flight, along with more sophisticated optical processors using laser light sources and specially designed very large lenses made from remarkably clear glass, allowed the Michigan group to advance system resolution, at about 5-year intervals, first to , then , and, by the mid-1970s, to 1 foot (the latter only over very short range intervals while processing was still being done optically). The latter levels and the associated very wide dynamic range proved suitable for identifying many objects of military concern as well as soil, water, vegetation, and ice features being studied by a variety of environmental researchers having security clearances allowing them access to what was then classified imagery. Similarly improved operational systems soon followed each of those finer- resolution steps. Comparison of earliest SAR image with a later improved- resolution one. Additionally, the data-processing light source had been changed from a mercury lamp to a laser. Image data courtesy of University of Michigan and Natural Resources Canada. Even the resolution stage had over- taxed the ability of cathode-ray tubes (limited to about 2000 distinguishable items across the screen diameter) to deliver fine enough details to signal films while still covering wide range swaths, and taxed the optical processing systems in similar ways. However, at about the same time, digital computers finally became capable of doing the processing without similar limitation, and the consequent presentation of the images on cathode ray tube monitors instead of film allowed for better control over tonal reproduction and for more convenient image mensuration. Achievement of the finest resolutions at long ranges was aided by adding the capability to swing a larger airborne antenna so as to more strongly illuminate a limited target area continually while collecting data over several degrees of aspect, removing the previous limitation of resolution to the antenna width. This was referred to as the spotlight mode, which no longer produced continuous-swath images but, instead, images of isolated patches of terrain. It was understood very early in SAR development that the extremely smooth orbital path of an out-of-the-atmosphere platform made it ideally suited to SAR operation. Early experience with artificial earth satellites had also demonstrated that the Doppler frequency shifts of signals traveling through the ionosphere and atmosphere were stable enough to permit very fine resolution to be achievable even at ranges of hundreds of kilometers.An experimental study of rapid phase fluctuations induced along a satellite to earth propagation path, Porcello, L.J., Univ. of Michigan, April 1964 While further experimental verification of those facts by a project now referred to as the Quill satelliteQuill (satellite) (declassified in 2012) occurred within the second decade after the initial work began, several of the capabilities for creating useful classified systems did not exist for another two decades. That seemingly slow rate of advances was often paced by the progress of other inventions, such as the laser, the digital computer, circuit miniaturization, and compact data storage. Once the laser appeared, optical data processing became a fast process because it provided many parallel analog channels, but devising optical chains suited to matching signal focal lengths to ranges proceeded by many stages and turned out to call for some novel optical components. Since the process depended on diffraction of light waves, it required anti-vibration mountings, clean rooms, and highly trained operators. Even at its best, its use of CRTs and film for data storage placed limits on the range depth of images. At several stages, attaining the frequently over-optimistic expectations for digital computation equipment proved to take far longer than anticipated. For example, the SEASAT system was ready to orbit before its digital processor became available, so a quickly assembled optical recording and processing scheme had to be used to obtain timely confirmation of system operation. In 1978, the first digital SAR processor was developed by the Canadian aerospace company MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA).\\"Observation of the earth and its environment: survey of missions and sensors\\", Herbert J. Kramer When its digital processor was finally completed and used, the digital equipment of that time took many hours to create one swath of image from each run of a few seconds of data.\\"Principles of Synthetic Aperture Radar\\", S. W. McCandless and C. R. Jackson, Chapter 1 of \\"SAR Marine Users Manual\\", NOAA, 2004, p.11. Still, while that was a step down in speed, it was a step up in image quality. Modern methods now provide both high speed and high quality. Although the above specifies the system development contributions of only a few organizations, many other groups had also become players as the value of SAR became more and more apparent. Especially crucial to the organization and funding of the initial long development process was the technical expertise and foresight of a number of both civilian and uniformed project managers in equipment procurement agencies in the federal government, particularly, of course, ones in the armed forces and in the intelligence agencies, and also in some civilian space agencies. Since a number of publications and Internet sites refer to a young MIT physics graduate named Robert Rines as having invented fine-resolution radar in the 1940s, persons who have been exposed to those may wonder why that has not been mentioned here. Actually, none of his several radar-image-related patentsU. S. Pat. Nos. 2696522, 2711534, 2627600, 2711530, and 19 others actually had that goal. Instead, they presumed that fine-resolution images of radar object fields could be accomplished by already-known \\"dielectric lenses\\", the inventive parts of those patents being ways to convert those microwave-formed images to visible ones. However, that presumption incorrectly implied that such lenses and their images could be of sizes comparable to their optical- wave counterparts, whereas the tremendously larger wavelengths of microwaves would actually require the lenses to have apertures thousands of feet (or meters) wide, like the ones simulated by SARs, and the images would be comparably large. Apparently not only did that inventor fail to recognize that fact, but so also did the patent examiners who approved his several applications, and so also have those who have propagated the erroneous tale so widely. Persons seeking to understand SAR should not be misled by references to those patents. Relationship to phased arrays A technique closely related to SAR uses an array (referred to as a \\"phased array\\") of real antenna elements spatially distributed over either one or two dimensions perpendicular to the radar-range dimension. These physical arrays are truly synthetic ones, indeed being created by synthesis of a collection of subsidiary physical antennas. Their operation need not involve motion relative to targets. All elements of these arrays receive simultaneously in real time, and the signals passing through them can be individually subjected to controlled shifts of the phases of those signals. One result can be to respond most strongly to radiation received from a specific small scene area, focusing on that area to determine its contribution to the total signal received. The coherently detected set of signals received over the entire array aperture can be replicated in several data-processing channels and processed differently in each. The set of responses thus traced to different small scene areas can be displayed together as an image of the scene. In comparison, a SAR's (commonly) single physical antenna element gathers signals at different positions at different times. When the radar is carried by an aircraft or an orbiting vehicle, those positions are functions of a single variable, distance along the vehicle's path, which is a single mathematical dimension (not necessarily the same as a linear geometric dimension). The signals are stored, thus becoming functions, no longer of time, but of recording locations along that dimension. When the stored signals are read out later and combined with specific phase shifts, the result is the same as if the recorded data had been gathered by an equally long and shaped phased array. What is thus synthesized is a set of signals equivalent to what could have been received simultaneously by such an actual large-aperture (in one dimension) phased array. The SAR simulates (rather than synthesizes) that long one-dimensional phased array. Although the term in the title of this article has thus been incorrectly derived, it is now firmly established by half a century of usage. While operation of a phased array is readily understood as a completely geometric technique, the fact that a synthetic aperture system gathers its data as it (or its target) moves at some speed means that phases which varied with the distance traveled originally varied with time, hence constituted temporal frequencies. Temporal frequencies being the variables commonly used by radar engineers, their analyses of SAR systems are usually (and very productively) couched in such terms. In particular, the variation of phase during flight over the length of the synthetic aperture is seen as a sequence of Doppler shifts of the received frequency from that of the transmitted frequency. It is significant, though, to realize that, once the received data have been recorded and thus have become timeless, the SAR data-processing situation is also understandable as a special type of phased array, treatable as a completely geometric process. The core of both the SAR and the phased array techniques is that the distances that radar waves travel to and back from each scene element consist of some integer number of wavelengths plus some fraction of a \\"final\\" wavelength. Those fractions cause differences between the phases of the re-radiation received at various SAR or array positions. Coherent detection is needed to capture the signal phase information in addition to the signal amplitude information. That type of detection requires finding the differences between the phases of the received signals and the simultaneous phase of a well-preserved sample of the transmitted illumination. Every wave scattered from any point in the scene has a circular curvature about that point as a center. Signals from scene points at different ranges therefore arrive at a planar array with different curvatures, resulting in signal phase changes which follow different quadratic variations across a planar phased array. Additional linear variations result from points located in different directions from the center of the array. Fortunately, any one combination of these variations is unique to one scene point, and is calculable. For a SAR, the two-way travel doubles that phase change. In reading the following two paragraphs, be particularly careful to distinguish between array elements and scene elements. Also remember that each of the latter has, of course, a matching image element. Comparison of the array-signal phase variation across the array with the total calculated phase variation pattern can reveal the relative portion of the total received signal that came from the only scene point that could be responsible for that pattern. One way to do the comparison is by a correlation computation, multiplying, for each scene element, the received and the calculated field-intensity values array element by array element and then summing the products for each scene element. Alternatively, one could, for each scene element, subtract each array element's calculated phase shift from the actual received phase and then vectorially sum the resulting field-intensity differences over the array. Wherever in the scene the two phases substantially cancel everywhere in the array, the difference vectors being added are in phase, yielding, for that scene point, a maximum value for the sum. The equivalence of these two methods can be seen by recognizing that multiplication of sinusoids can be done by summing phases which are complex-number exponents of e, the base of natural logarithms. However it is done, the image-deriving process amounts to \\"backtracking\\" the process by which nature previously spread the scene information over the array. In each direction, the process may be viewed as a Fourier transform, which is a type of correlation process. The image-extraction process we use can then be seen as another Fourier transform which is a reversal of the original natural one. It is important to realize that only those sub- wavelength differences of successive ranges from the transmitting antenna to each target point and back, which govern signal phase, are used to refine the resolution in any geometric dimension. The central direction and the angular width of the illuminating beam do not contribute directly to creating that fine resolution. Instead, they serve only to select the solid-angle region from which usable range data are received. While some distinguishing of the ranges of different scene items can be made from the forms of their sub- wavelength range variations at short ranges, the very large depth of focus that occurs at long ranges usually requires that over-all range differences (larger than a wavelength) be used to define range resolutions comparable to the achievable cross-range resolution. Data collection A model of a German SAR-Lupe reconnaissance satellite inside a Cosmos-3M rocket. Highly accurate data can be collected by aircraft overflying the terrain in question. In the 1980s, as a prototype for instruments to be flown on the NASA Space Shuttles, NASA operated a synthetic aperture radar on a NASA Convair 990. In 1986, this plane caught fire on takeoff. In 1988, NASA rebuilt a C, L, and P-band SAR to fly on the NASA DC-8 aircraft. Called AIRSAR, it flew missions at sites around the world until 2004. Another such aircraft, the Convair 580, was flown by the Canada Center for Remote Sensing until about 1996 when it was handed over to Environment Canada due to budgetary reasons. Most land-surveying applications are now carried out by satellite observation. Satellites such as ERS-1/2, JERS-1, Envisat ASAR, and RADARSAT-1 were launched explicitly to carry out this sort of observation. Their capabilities differ, particularly in their support for interferometry, but all have collected tremendous amounts of valuable data. The Space Shuttle also carried synthetic aperture radar equipment during the SIR-A and SIR-B missions during the 1980s, the Shuttle Radar Laboratory (SRL) missions in 1994 and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in 2000. The Venera 15 and Venera 16 followed later by the Magellan space probe mapped the surface of Venus over several years using synthetic aperture radar. Titan ‚Äì Evolving feature in Ligeia Mare (SAR; 21 August 2014). Synthetic aperture radar was first used by NASA on JPL's Seasat oceanographic satellite in 1978 (this mission also carried an altimeter and a scatterometer); it was later developed more extensively on the Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR) missions on the space shuttle in 1981, 1984 and 1994. The Cassini mission to Saturn used SAR to map the surface of the planet's major moon Titan, whose surface is partly hidden from direct optical inspection by atmospheric haze. The SHARAD sounding radar on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MARSIS instrument on Mars Express have observed bedrock beneath the surface of the Mars polar ice and also indicated the likelihood of substantial water ice in the Martian middle latitudes. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched in 2009, carries a SAR instrument called Mini-RF, which was designed largely to look for water ice deposits on the poles of the Moon. Titan ‚Äì Ligeia Mare ‚Äì SAR and clearer despeckled views. The Mineseeker Project is designing a system for determining whether regions contain landmines based on a blimp carrying ultra-wideband synthetic aperture radar. Initial trials show promise; the radar is able to detect even buried plastic mines. SAR has been used in radio astronomy for many years to simulate a large radio telescope by combining observations taken from multiple locations using a mobile antenna. The National Reconnaissance Office maintains a fleet of (now declassified) synthetic aperture radar satellites commonly designated as Lacrosse or Onyx. In February 2009, the Sentinel R1 surveillance aircraft entered service in the RAF, equipped with the SAR-based Airborne Stand-Off Radar (ASTOR) system. The German Armed Forces' (Bundeswehr) military SAR-Lupe reconnaissance satellite system has been fully operational since 22 July 2008. Data distribution The Alaska Satellite Facility provides production, archiving and distribution to the scientific community of SAR data products and tools from active and past missions, including the June 2013 release of newly processed, 35-year-old Seasat SAR imagery. CSTARS downlinks and processes SAR data (as well as other data) from a variety of satellites and supports the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. CSTARS also supports disaster relief operations, oceanographic and meteorological research, and port and maritime security research projects.

Although most of the monument area is in Moffat County, Colorado, the Dinosaur Quarry is located in Utah, north of the town of Jensen, Utah at . The nearest Colorado town is Dinosaur while the nearest city is Vernal, Utah. The park contains over 800 paleontological sites and has fossils of dinosaurs including Allosaurus, Deinonychus, Abydosaurus, and various sauropods. The Abydosaurus consists of a nearly complete skull, the lower jaw, and first four neck vertebrae. The specimen was found at the base of the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation and is the holotype for the description. The area around the quarry was declared a national monument on October 4, 1915. The International Dark-Sky Association designated Dinosaur National Monument an International Dark Sky Park in April 2019. Geology Multicolored beds of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation The rock layer enclosing the fossils is a sandstone and conglomerate bed of alluvial or river bed origin known as the Morrison Formation from the Jurassic Period some 150 million years old. The dinosaurs and other ancient animals were carried by the river system which eventually entombed their remains in Utah. The pile of sediments were later buried and lithified into solid rock. The layers of rock were later uplifted and tilted to their present angle by the mountain building forces that formed the Uinta Mountains during the Laramide orogeny. The relentless forces of erosion exposed the layers at the surface to be found by paleontologists. History Fremont people The Fremont people lived in the area of what is now Dinosaur National Monument before the 14th century, with archaeological evidence dating from 200 to 1300. Archaeologists first studied and named the Fremont culture along the Fremont River in south-central Utah and have since traced it through much of the Green and Colorado River drainages. The Fremont did not build large permanent dwellings; instead, they lived in small bands within natural shelters, such as rock overhangs or shallow caves, or small villages. They consumed plant foods, such as pine nuts, berries, and cactus fruits, as well as wild game, including mule deer, bighorn sheep, smaller mammals, and birds. They also grew corn, beans, and squash, sometimes using irrigation techniques. The fate of the Fremont culture is unclear. Recent theories suggest that the Fremont‚Äôs lifestyle may have changed due to drought or other climate factors, dwindling natural resources, or the influence of other neighboring cultures. They left evidence of their presence in the form of petroglyphs and pictographs of human and animal figures, and abstract designs. Human figures typically have trapezoidal bodies and elaborate decorations that suggest headdresses, earrings, necklaces, or shields. The animal figures include bighorn sheep, birds, snakes, and lizards. Purely abstract or geometric designs, such as circles, spirals, and various combinations of lines, are common. Many designs in the monument are accessible for close viewing, along four trails in Utah, one of which is near the visitor center, and a fifth trail in Colorado. Early scientific explorations Paleontologist chips rock matrix from a column of vertebrae in the Dinosaur Quarry. The dinosaur fossil beds (bone beds) were discovered in 1909 by Earl Douglass, a paleontologist working and collecting for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. He and his crews excavated thousands of fossils and shipped them back to the museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for study and display. National monument President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the dinosaur beds as Dinosaur National Monument in 1915. The monument boundaries have been expanded from the original surrounding the dinosaur quarry in Utah, to in Utah and Colorado, encompassing the river canyons of the Green and Yampa.  Echo Park Dam controversy  The plans made by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on a ten-dam, billion dollar Colorado River Storage Project began to arouse opposition in the early 1950s when it was announced that one of the proposed dams would be at Echo Park, in the middle of Dinosaur National Monument. The controversy assumed major proportions, dominating conservation politics for years. David Brower, executive director of the Sierra Club, and Howard Zahniser of The Wilderness Society led an unprecedented nationwide campaign to preserve the free-flowing rivers and scenic canyons of the Green and Yampa Rivers. They argued that if a national monument was not safe from development, how could any wildland be kept intact? On the other side of the argument were powerful members of Congress from western states, who were committed to the project in order to secure water rights, obtain cheap hydroelectric power and develop reservoirs as tourist destinations. After much debate, Congress settled on a compromise that eliminated Echo Park Dam and authorized the rest of the project. The Colorado River Storage Project Act became law on April 11, 1956. It stated, \\"that no dam or reservoir constructed under the authorization of the Act shall be within any National Park or Monument.\\" Historians view the Echo Park Dam controversy as signaling the start of an era that includes major conservationist political successes such as the Wilderness Act and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

Typical of high deserts, summer temperatures can be exceedingly hot, while winter temperatures can be very cold. Snowfall is common, but the snow melts rapidly in the arid and sunny climates of these states. Rainfall is very low, and the evaporation rate classifies the area as desert, even though the rainfall exceeds 10 inches.  Features  The quarry Workers inside the Dinosaur Quarry building The \\"Wall of Bones\\" located within the Dinosaur Quarry building in the park consists of a steeply tilted (67¬∞ from horizontal) rock layer which contains hundreds of dinosaur fossils. The enclosing rock has been chipped away to reveal the fossil bones intact for public viewing. In July 2006, the Quarry Visitor Center was closed due to structural problems that since 1957 had plagued the building because it was built on unstable clay. The decision was made to build a new facility elsewhere in the monument to house the visitor center and administrative functions, making it easier to resolve the structural problems of the quarry building while still retaining a portion of the historic Mission 66 era exhibit hall. It was announced in April 2009 that Dinosaur National Monument would receive $13.1 million to refurbish and reopen the gallery as part of the Obama administration's $750 billion stimulus plan.

The resolution was adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, and is therefore binding on all UN member states. According to the official record of the meeting, the meeting convoked at 9:55 pm and adjourned at 10:00 pm. The five-minute meeting exemplified the Security Council's working method, in which the meeting serves only as a public announcement of a decision that has already been reached in secret in \\"informal consultations.\\" Although the United States is widely credited with initiating Resolution 1373, once adopted unanimously, the resolution became a common act of the Security Council, and therefore all its members at the time had ownership over it.  Aims of the resolution  The resolution aimed to hinder terrorist groups in various ways. It recalled provisions from resolutions 1189 (1998), 1269 (1999) and 1368 (2001) concerning terrorism. UN member states were encouraged to share their intelligence on terrorist groups in order to assist in combating international terrorism. The resolution also calls on all states to adjust their national laws so that they can ratify all of the existing international conventions on terrorism. It stated that all States \\"should also ensure that terrorist acts are established as serious criminal offences in domestic laws and regulations and that the seriousness of such acts is duly reflected in sentences served.\\" The resolution established the Security Council's Counter Terrorism Committee [CTC] to monitor state compliance with its provisions. It also aimed at restricting immigration law, stating that \\"before granting refugee status, all States should take appropriate measures to ensure that the asylum seekers had not planned, facilitated or participated in terrorist acts. Further, States should ensure that refugee status was not abused by the perpetrators, organizers or facilitators of terrorist acts, and that claims of political motivation were not recognized as grounds for refusing requests for the extradition of alleged terrorists.\\" However, the resolution failed to define 'Terrorism', and the working group initially only added Al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime of Afghanistan on the sanctions list. This also entailed the possibility that authoritarian regimes could label even non-violent activities as terrorist acts, thus infringing upon basic human rights.  Resolution 1456 (2003)  The absence of any specific reference to human rights considerations was remedied in part by Resolution 1456 (2003) which declared that \\"States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, and should adopt such measures in accordance with international law, in particular, international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.\\"  Resolution 1566  UN Security Council Resolution 1566 picked up loose ends from 1373 by actually spelling out what the Security Council sees as terrorism: Although this definition has operative effect for the purposes of Security Council action, it does not represent a definition of \\"terrorism\\" which binds all states in international law. That is a task which could only be achieved by way of agreeing to an international treaty under the auspices of the UN General Assembly. Negotiations towards agreeing to such are ongoing, and a Comprehensive Convention exists in draft form, however agreement to its exact terms, most particularly the definition of \\"terrorism\\", remains elusive. Resolution 1566 also called for the creation of a working group that will expand the list of terrorist entities under sanction beyond the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.  National implementation  Most states complied with the resolution, with varying willingness (Mexico and Venezuela being quite reluctant, especially concerning the freezing of assets of persons or groups whom they had no evidence of involvement in terrorism), but only a few of them did so by explicitly referring to the UN resolution. Russia implemented the resolution with great willingness - President of Russia Vladimir Putin translated the resolution into Russian and enacted it as domestic law by 10 January 2002 in the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No 6 On Measures Towards the Implementation of UN Security Resolution 1373.–£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –æ—Ç 10.01.2002 –≥. ‚Ññ 6, 10 January 2002 On 1st of April 2014, the Government of Sri Lanka signed an order designating 16 organisations functioning as terrorist fronts on foreign soil freezing all assets and economic resources of those, using this resolution.http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local/banned-no-fronting-ltte  CTC 2008 report  Recommendations of the Counter Terrorism Committee 2008 report included increased measures concerning illegal immigration (considered, without evidence, as a serious risk to security) as well as: *to \\"Promote inter-agency coordination and the exchange of counter-terrorism information at the national, regional and international levels\\"; *to \\"Encourage States to establish dedicated and permanent counter-terrorism units, with the assistance of experts seconded from various specialized institutions, in areas such as criminal law, counter-financing of terrorism and border control\\"; *to \\"Encourage greater cooperation with INTERPOL and increased utilization of its resources and databases, such as red notices and watch lists\\" (Interpol created in 2002 the Interpol Terrorism Watch List).  Criticism  Oxford University public law professor Stefan Talmon argued that this resolution is an example of the United Nations Security Council veering into legislating law in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks when its role is to apply and interpret international law.Stefan Talmond, 'The Security Council as World Legislator' (2005) 99 American Journal of International Law p. 175.Alexander Reilly, Gabrielle Appleby and Laura Grenfell.

It is -high, it is one of the highest peaks in the Alps.It is the 16th highest summit overall or, considering only those mountains with a prominence of at least 300 metres, it is the 7th highest Naming The original name was probably Dent d'H√©rens, the actual name of the nearby Dent d'H√©rens which does not overlook the Val d'H√©rens. The nearby north face of the Dent d'H√©rens is glaciated while the Dent Blanche holds much less snow, it was even called Dent Noire (Black Tooth) on the Woerl Atlas of 1842. In fact on older maps, in the area where lie both summits, only the name Weisszahnhorn (from German: White Tooth Peak) was indicated, the French name (Dent Blanche) appearing in 1820 only. Because cartographers usually made their observations far away from the mountainous remote areas and also because the Dent d'H√©rens is sometime hidden behind the Dent Blanche thus less visible, the latter received the name. The inhabitants of the lower Val d'H√©rens called the actual Dent d'H√©rens, Dent Blanche, but the ones of the upper Val d'H√©rens called the mountain, Dent de Rong or Dent d'Erins, contributing to the general confusion. The actual names are official since the completion of the Dufour map in 1862.Voyage autour de la Dent d'H√©rens, Fran√ßoise Funk-Salam√¨ sac-cas.ch  Geography  Dent Blanche rising above the Val d'H√©rens (right) The summit of Dent Blanche is an important geographic place as it is the converging point of three ridges. The three valleys separated by them are the Val d'H√©rens, Val d'Anniviers and Mattertal. The respective villages of Evol√®ne, Zinal and Zermatt lie approximatively at the same distance of the mountain. The Dent Blanche has four steep faces rising over four glaciers: The north-east face (also called north face) rises above the Grand Cornier Glacier (part of the Zinal Glacier), the south-east face rises above the Sch√∂nbiel Glacier (part of the Zmutt Glacier), the south-west face rises above the Manzettes Glacier (part of the Ferp√®cle Glacier) and, finally, the north-west face of Dent Blanche rises above the homonym glacier. The four ridges encompass almost exactly the four cardinal directions. The west ridge is named Ar√™te de Ferp√®cle and the east ridge is named Ar√™te des Quatre √Çnes. The Col de la Dent Blanche (3,531 m) lies at the foot of the northern ridge, the Bivouac de la Dent Blanche is located there. The Dent Blanche Hut lies at the foot of the southern ridge which is used as the normal route. The grade of the route is AD (III+).https://www.summitpost.org/south- ridge-wandfluegrat-or-normal/156390 The region around Dent Blanche consists of many 4000 metres peaks. The Ober Gabelhorn (west), Dent d'H√©rens and Matterhorn (south) are the closest high summits.  Climbing history  Panorama from the Grand Mountet Hut with the Dent Blanche north face on the far right, the summit on the left is the Ober Gabelhorn The south-east face and the southern ridge (normal route) on the left The first ascent was made via the south ridge (Wandfluegrat), which is the less difficult route to the summit and the actual normal route. On 12 July 1862, T. S. Kennedy, after an attempt on the east face of the unconquered Matterhorn, almost reached the summit with the guides Peter Taugwalder and his son. But after a minor accident, Peter Taugwalder refused to go any higher. Kennedy would finally reach the summit only a few days later, on July 18, 1862 with W. Wigram, J. Croz and J. Konig, despite adverse weather conditions.Helmut Dumler,Willi P. Burkhardt, Les 4000 des Alpes, A route on the east ridge was opened on 11 August 1882 by John Stafford Anderson and G. P. Baker, with guides Alois Pollinger of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais and Ulrich Almer. They started from the Mountet Hut and arrived at the summit after a difficult 12 hours climbing on a dangerous ridge overlooking the north face. Almer said on the summit, \\"We are four asses\\", and the ridge was then named Ar√™te des Quatre √Çnes or Viereselsgrat (Ridge of the Four Asses). The north ridge was explored in 1899. On 28 August O. G. Jones, F. W. Hill with guides E. Furrer, C. Zurbriggen and J. Vuignier headed to the summit but they fell and only Hill survived. He reached alone the summit and a storm forced him to make a bivouac. He could report the news of the fatal accident in Zermatt only two days later. The first ascent of the north north west ridge ‚Äì described as \\"one of the last great problems\\" of the Pennine Alps ‚Äì was by Dorothy Pilley Richards and I. A. Richards with Joseph Georges and Antoine Georges on 20 July 1928. Dorothy Pilley Richards later wrote up the ascent in her mountaineering memoir, Climbing Days (1935). The first ascent of the north face is attributed to K. Schneider and F. Singer on 26 and 27 August 1932. They climbed from the left part at the base of the face to the summit. Only on 12 July 1966, Michel and Yvette Vaucher made a direct ascent on the north face. The first winter ascent by the north ridge was completed by P. Crettaz and J. Gaudin on March 2, 1963. A solo winter ascent on the north face was made for the first time in 1968 by C. Bournissen.

Not all trampolines have springs, as the Springfree Trampoline uses glass-reinforced plastic rods. People bounce on trampolines for recreational and competitive purposes. The fabric that users bounce on (commonly known as the \\"bounce mat\\" or \\"trampoline bed\\") is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs that connect it to the frame, which store potential energy. History  Early trampoline-like devices  Amundsen's Maud Expedition I√±upiat blanket toss during the Nalukataq festival in Barrow, Alaska (2006) A game similar to trampolining was developed by the Inuit, who would toss blanket dancers into the air on a walrus skin one at a time (see Nalukataq) during a spring celebration of whale harvest. There is also some evidence of people in Europe having been tossed into the air by a number of people holding a blanket. Mak in the Wakefield Second Shepherds' Play and Sancho Panza in Don Quixote are both subjected to blanketing ‚Äì however, these are clearly non-voluntary, non-recreational instances of quasi-judicial, mob- administered punishment. The trampoline-like life nets once used by firefighters to catch people jumping out of burning buildings were invented in 1887. The 19th-century poster for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal refers to performance on trampoline. The device is thought to have been more like a springboard than the fabric-and-coiled-springs apparatus presently in use. These may not be the true antecedents of the modern sport of trampolining, but indicate that the concept of bouncing off a fabric surface has been around for some time. In the early years of the 20th century, some acrobats used a \\"bouncing bed\\" on the stage to amuse audiences. The bouncing bed was a form of small trampoline covered by bedclothes, on which acrobats performed mostly comedy routines. According to circus folklore, the trampoline was supposedly first developed by an artiste named du Trampolin, who saw the possibility of using the trapeze safety net as a form of propulsion and landing device and experimented with different systems of suspension, eventually reducing the net to a practical size for separate performance. While trampoline-like devices were used for shows and in the circus, the story of du Trampolin is almost certainly apocryphal. No documentary evidence has been found to support it. William Daly Paley of Thomas A. Edison, Inc. filmed blanket tossing initiation of a new recruit in Company F, 1st Ohio Volunteers in 1898. First modern trampolines The first modern trampoline was built by George Nissen and Larry Griswold in 1936.WestView Trampoline Community site - Trampoline History p. 3 Nissen was a gymnastics and diving competitor and Griswold was a tumbler on the gymnastics team, both at the University of Iowa, United States. They had observed trapeze artists using a tight net to add entertainment value to their performance and experimented by stretching a piece of canvas, in which they had inserted grommets along each side, to an angle iron frame by means of coiled springs. It was initially used to train tumblers but soon became popular in its own right. Nissen explained that the name came from the Spanish trampol√≠n, meaning a diving board. Nissen had heard the word on a demonstration tour in Mexico in the late 1930s and decided to use an anglicized form as the trademark for the apparatus. In 1942, Griswold and Nissen created the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline & Tumbling Company, and began making trampolines commercially in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The generic term for the trademarked trampoline was a rebound tumbler and the sport began as rebound tumbling. It has since lost its trademark and has become a generic trademark. 1968 demonstration of Spaceball Early in their development Nissen anticipated trampolines being used in a number of recreational areas, including those involving more than one participant on the same trampoline. One such game was Spaceballa game of two teams of two on a single trampoline with specially constructed end \\"walls\\" and a middle \\"wall\\" through which a ball could be propelled to hit a target on the other side's end wall. Use in flight and astronaut training During World War II, the United States Navy Flight School developed the use of the trampoline in its training of pilots and navigators, giving them concentrated practice in spatial orientation that had not been possible before.WestView Trampoline Community site - Trampoline History p.4 After the war, the development of the space flight programme again brought the trampoline into use to help train both American and Soviet astronauts, giving them experience of variable body positions in flight. Competitive sports Girls competing in synchronised trampoline The first Trampoline World Championships were organised by Ted Blake of Nissen, and held in London in 1964. The first World Champions were both American, Dan Millman and Judy Wills Cline. Cline went on to dominate and become the most highly decorated trampoline champion of all time. One of the earliest pioneers of trampoline as a competitive sport was Jeff Hennessy, a coach at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Hennessy also coached the United States trampoline team, producing more world champions than any other person. Among his world champions was his daughter, Leigh Hennessy. Both Jeff and Leigh Hennessy are in the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame. The competitive gymnastic sport of trampolining has been part of the Olympic Games since 2000. On a modern competitive trampoline, a skilled athlete can bounce to a height of up to , performing multiple somersaults and twists. Trampolines also feature in the competitive sport of Slamball, a variant of basketball, and Bossaball, a variant of volleyball. Cross-training for other sports There are a number of other sports that use trampolines to help develop and hone acrobatic skills in training before they are used in the actual sporting venue. Examples can be found in diving, gymnastics, and freestyle skiing. One main advantage of trampolining as a training tool for other acrobatic sports is that it allows repetitive drill practice for acrobatic experience every two seconds or less, compared with many minutes with sports that involve hills, ramps or high platforms. In some situations, it can also be safer compared to landings on the ground. Types of trampolines The frame of a competitive trampoline is made of steel and can be made to fold up for transportation to competition venues. The trampoline bed is rectangular in size fitted into the frame with around 110 steel springs (the actual number may vary by manufacturer). The bed is made of a strong fabric, although this is not itself elastic; the elasticity is provided only by the springs. The fabric can be woven from webbing, which is the most commonly used material. However, in the 2007 World Championships held in Quebec City, a Ross bed (or two-string bed), woven from individual thin strings, was used. This type of bed gives a little extra height to the rebound. Bounce mat Recreational trampolines for home use are less sturdily constructed than competitive ones and their springs are weaker. They may be of various shapes, though most are circular, octagonal or rectangular. The fabric is usually a waterproof canvas or woven polypropylene material. As with competitive trampolines, recreational trampolines are usually made using coiled steel springs to provide the rebounding force, but spring-free trampolines also exist. Commercial trampoline parks House of Air Trampoline Park in San FranciscoIn 1959 and 1960, it became very popular to have outdoor commercial \\"jump centres\\" or \\"trampoline parks\\" in many places in North America where people could enjoy recreational trampolining. However, these tended to have a high accident rate, and the public's interest rapidly waned.WestView Trampoline Community site - Trampoline History p. 19 In the early 21st century, indoor commercial trampoline parks have made a comeback, with a number of franchises operating across the United States and Canada. ABC News has reported that in 2014 there were at least 345 trampoline parks operating in the United States. Similar parks have more recently been opened in other countries.\\"Businessman turning former studios into a trampoline palace\\" , Herald Tribune, March 20, 2013 The International Association of Trampoline Parks (IATP) estimated that park numbers had grown from 35-40 parks in 2011 to around 280 in 2014. The following year, IATP estimated that 345 parks were open by the end of 2014, and that another 115 would open by the end of 2015 in North America. IATP also estimated that at the end of 2014 there were 40 parks outside of North America, and that by the end of 2015 there would be at least 100 indoor trampoline parks open internationally. As of March 2019, CircusTrix (and its subsidiary Sky Zone) is the largest operator of trampoline parks in the U.S. and in the world, with 319 parks operating under their brands. These commercial parks are located indoors, and have wall- to wall-trampolines to prevent people falling off the trampolines on to hard surfaces. Padded or spring walls protect people from impact injuries. Despite these precautions, there has been at least one death recorded due to a head- first landing at a trampoline park. In March 2012, New York Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain seriously injured his ankle while jumping at a commercial jump centre in Tampa with his son.\\"Joba‚Äôs a pitcher of calm on 911 tape\\" , New York Daily News In 2018, a man died in a British Columbia trampoline park, which prompted calls for more safety regulations for these popular activities. Wall running Wall running Wall running is a sport where the participant uses a wall and platforms placed next to the trampoline bed to do tricks. The basic movement is a backdrop on the trampoline and then the feet touching the wall at the top of the bounce. From there, there is no limit to the acrobatic movements that are possible, similar to regular trampolining. The advantage is that twists and turns can be initiated more forcefully from a solid wall and that the vertical speed can be transferred to rotation in addition to forces from the legs or arms. Additionally, energy can be gained both from the bed at the bottom of the bounce, and from the wall at the top of the bounce. Safety With safety nets, the risk of falling off the trampoline is reduced. Using a trampoline can be dangerous. Organized clubs and gyms usually have large safety end-decks with foam pads at each end, and spotters are placed alongside the trampoline to try to break the fall of any athlete who loses control and falls. In 1999, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated there were 100,000 hospital emergency room visits for trampoline injuries. Due to the much larger numbers involved and lesser safety standards, the majority of injuries occur on privately owned home trampolines or in commercial trampoline facilities rather than organized gyms.Doctors warn of trampoline injury risks , CBC News - Health, September 24, 2012, retrieved August 2, 2016 CBC Television's Marketplace discovered that the trampoline park industry is unregulated in Canada, with different standards for padding and foam pit depth, self-inspections and repairs, and not being required to report injuries. It was also noted that there were generally too few staff to enforce rules, and that promotional advertisements often showed participants engaging in somersaults even though this was extremely dangerous without proper training. All trampoline parks rely upon liability waivers, where signee assumes the risk of the activity including when injuries result from the establishment's own negligence or poorly maintained equipment, rather than beefing up safety standards and supervision. Bouncing off a trampoline can result in a fall of from the peak of a bounce to the ground or a fall into the suspension springs and frame. There has been an increase in the number of home trampolines in recent years and a corresponding increase in the number of injuries reported. Some medical organizations have suggested that the devices be banned from home use. Authorities recommend that only one person should be allowed to jump at a time to avoid collisions and people being catapulted in an unexpected direction or higher than they expect. One of the most common sources of injury is when multiple users are bouncing on the trampoline at one time. More often than not, this situation leads to users bouncing into one another and thus becoming injured; many suffer broken bones as a result of landing badly after knocking into another user. A recreational trampoline with a safety net enclosure Another of the most common sources of serious injury is an attempt to perform somersaults without proper training. In some cases, people land on their neck or head, which can cause paralysis or even death. In an infamous incident in the 1960s, pole-vaulting champion Brian Sternberg became paralyzed from the neck down in a trampoline accident. Danger can be reduced by burying the trampoline so the bed is closer to the surrounding surface to lessen falling distance, and padding that surrounding area. Pads over the spring and frame reduce the severity of impact injuries. Keeping the springs covered also reduces the risk of a limb falling between the gaps in the springs and the rest of the body falling off the trampoline. Kits are available for home trampolines that provide a retaining net around the trampoline and prevent users from bouncing over the edge. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that there is no epidemiological evidence that these improve safety. The nets do prevent jumpers falling off the trampoline onto the ground, but these falls are not the most common source of injury. Multiple users bouncing in a netted trampoline can still be injured. Safety net enclosures have a larger benefit for safeguarding solo trampolinists, so long as they avoid falling on their head or neck. Having some training in a gym may be beneficial in alerting people to possible hazards and provide techniques to avoid bad falls. Trampoline Safety , Consumer Affairs Family-oriented commercial areas in North America, such as shopping centres, carnivals, and so on, often include closed inflatable trampolines (CITs) as a children's attraction. These have safety nets on the sides to prevent injuries. Mini- trampolines Mini-trampoline A mini-trampoline (also known as a rebounder, trampette, jogging trampoline, or exercise trampoline) is a type of trampoline less than in diameter and about off the ground, often kept indoors and used as part of a physical fitness regime. So-called rebounding provides a form of exercise with a low impact on knees and joints. Mini-trampolines do not give a rebound as high as larger recreational or competitive trampolines. Most department and big-box stores sell mini-trampolines. Educational use Trampoline activity has been used by science teachers to illustrate Newton's Three Laws of Motion, as well as the \\"elastic collision.\\" In co-operation with the University of Bremen and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the machtWissen.de Corporation from Bremen, Germany developed the weightlessness demonstrator \\"Gravity Jumper\\" based on a trampoline. Due to the acceleration during the jump, an acceleration force takes effect in addition to the usual gravitational force. Both forces add up and the person on the trampoline seems to become heavier. As soon as the jumper leaves the trampoline, he is under a free fall condition, which means that the jumper seems weightless and does not feel the acceleration due to gravity. Every person receives a three-axis acceleration sensor, fastened to them with a belt. The sensor transmits the data of the flight path to a monitor; a monitor shows the course of the acceleration, including the weightless phase. The interplay of acceleration due to the trampoline and weightlessness becomes apparent.

In most cases, there are limitations to transferability with regards to geography, service area coverage, and technology. Location Portability and Service Portability are not consistently defined or deployed in the telecommunication industry. In the United States and Canada, mobile number portability is referred to as WNP or WLNP (Wireless LNP).http://wireless.fcc.gov/wlnp/ In the rest of the world it is referred to as mobile number portability (MNP). Wireless number portability is available in some parts of Africa, Asia, Australia, Latin America and most European countries including Britain; however, this relates to transferability between mobile phone lines only. Canada, South Africa and the United States are the only countries that offer full number portability transfers between both fixed lines and mobile phone lines, because mobile and fixed line numbers are mixed in the same area codes, and are billed identically for the calling party, the mobile user usually pays for incoming calls and texts; in other countries all mobile numbers are placed in higher priced mobile-dedicated area codes and the originator of the call to the mobile phone pays for the call. The government of Hong Kong has tentatively approved fixed-mobile number portability; however, as of July 2012, this service is not yet available. Some cellular telephone companies will charge for this conversion as a regulatory cost recovery fee. History LNP was invented by Edward Sonnenberg while working for Siemens. Though it was introduced as a tool to promote competition in the heavily monopolized wireline telecommunications industry, number portability became popular with the advent of mobile telephones, since in most countries different mobile operators are provided with different area codes and, without portability, changing one's operator would require changing one's number. Some operators, especially incumbent operators with large existing subscriber bases, have argued against portability on the grounds that providing this service incurs considerable overhead, while others argue that it prevents vendor lock-in and allows them to compete fairly on price and service. Due to this conflict of interest, number portability is usually mandated for all operators by telecommunications regulatory authorities. In the US, LNP was mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1996. The mandate required all carriers in the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) to be \\"LNP-capable\\" and port numbers to any carriers sending a BFR (bona fide request). The ability to keep a number while switching providers is thought to be attractive to consumers. It was also a major point made by CLECs (competitive local exchange carriers) preventing customers from leaving ILECs (incumbent local exchange carriers), thus hindering competition. Details regarding the reasons for LNP and how it is to be implemented can be found in the First Report and Order referenced above. In the US, the FCC has mandated this in order to increase competition among providers. As of late November 2003, LNP was required for all landline and wireless common carriers, so long as the number is being ported to the same geographical area or telephone exchange. This latest mandate included carriers outside the top 100 MSAs that previously enjoyed a rural carrier exemption. Portability schemes There are four main methods to route a number whose operator has changed. All Call Query (ACQ) The operator that originates the call always check a centralized database and obtains the route to the call. The originating operator then routes the call to Serving Network. Query on Release (QoR) The operator that originates the call first checks with the operator to which the number initially belonged, the donor operator. The donor operator verifies the call and informs that it no longer possesses the number. The operator that originates the call then checks the centralized database, as is done with ACQ. Call Dropback Also known as Return to Pivot (RoP). The operator that originates the call first checks with the donor operator. The donor operator checks its own database and provides a new route. The operator that originates the call then uses this route to forward the call. No central database is consulted. Onward Routing (OR) The operator that originates the call routes the call to the donor operator. The donor operator checks its own database and obtains a new route. The operator to which the number was designated routes the call to the new operator. This model is called indirect routing. Technical issues Complexity for number portability can come from many sources. Historically, numbers were assigned to various operators in blocks. The operators, who were often also service providers, then provided these numbers to the subscribers of telephone services. Numbers were also recycled in blocks. With number portability, it is envisioned that the size of these blocks may grow smaller or even to single numbers. Once this occurs the granularity of such operations will represent a greater workload for the telecommunications provider. With phone numbers assigned to various operators in blocks, the system worked quite well in a fixed line environment since everyone was attached to the same infrastructure. The situation becomes somewhat more complex in a wireless environment such as that created by cellular communications. In number portability the ‚Äúdonor network‚Äù provides the number and the ‚Äúrecipient network‚Äù accepts the number. The operation of donating a number requires that a number be ‚Äúsnapped out‚Äù from a network and ‚Äúsnapped into‚Äù the receiving network. If the subscriber ceases to need the number then it is normal that the original donor receive the number back and ‚Äúsnaps back‚Äù the number to its network. The situation is slightly more complex if the user leaves the first operator for a second and then subsequently elects to use a third operator. In this case the second operator will return the number to the first and then it is assigned to the third. In cellular communications the concept of a location registry exists to tie a ‚Äúmobile station‚Äù (such as a cellular phone) to the number. If a number is dialed it is necessary to be able to determine where in the network the mobile station exists. Some mechanism for such forwarding must exist. (For an example of such a system, see the article on the GSM network.) In the US, there are standards for portability defined by the FCC, the LNPA, NANPA and the ATIS which are agreed upon by all member providers to help make LNP as cost-efficient and expedient as possible while still retaining a healthy level security for all providers and in respect of the highest level of customer service. These rules, first defined in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Reports and Orders by the FCC (publicly available at fcc.gov), are further detailed by the LNPA in order to ensure any provider can successfully port numbers to any other provider. iconectiv provides a national database called the NPAC (National Portability Administration Center) which contains the correct routing information for all ported and pooled numbers in the US and Canada. The NPAC maintains detailed documentation of the procedure common among US carriers to port numbers as described here. Providers use SS7 to route calls throughout the US/Canada network. SS7 accesses databases for various services such as CNAM, LIDB, Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS) and LNP. Calls to ported numbers are completed when a customer who calls a ported number sends the dialed number to a provider's SSP (Service Switch Point), where it is identified either as a local call or not. If the call is local, the switch has the NPA- NXX in its routing table as portable, so it sends a routing request to the Signal Transfer Point (STP) which accesses a local database that is updated by an LSMS (Local Service Management System) which holds all routing for all ported numbers to which the carrier is responsible for completing calls. If routing information is found, a response is sent to the \\"query\\" containing the information necessary to properly route the call. If it is not a local number, the call is passed on to the STP and routed until it gets to a local carrier who will perform the \\"query\\" mentioned earlier and route the call accordingly. The routing information necessary to complete these calls is known as a Location Routing Number (LRN). The LRN is no more than a simple 10-digit telephone number that resides in the switch of the service provider currently providing service for the ported telephone number. When a provider receives a request to port a telephone number from a new customer, that provider sends an industry-standard Local Service Request (LSR) to the existing (or \\"old\\") provider. When the Old Provider receives this request, it sends back Firm Order Confirmation (FOC) and the process of porting the number(s) begins. Either provider can initiate the port using a Service Order Activator (SOA or LSOA) which directly edits the NPAC database mentioned before. Providers can also make these requests within the NPAC database directly. If the new provider initiates the port, it is called a \\"pull,\\" and if the old provider initiates, it is a \\"push.\\" Once the number is pulled or pushed, the providers must concur the request and the new provider must \\"activate\\" the number using the LRN of the switch serving the customer on the agreed due date. At the point this is completed, the number is ported. Much of this process is duplicated in intermodal portability (porting between wireline and wireless providers). There are a few technical differences, however, in WLNP‚ÄîEspecially with concern to the time intervals allowed. Fax and paging numbers Some service providers, especially related to fax services, do not qualify as a \\"local exchange carrier\\" or other form of telecommunications carrier.47 USC 251(b)(2): Each local exchange carrier has the following duties: *** (2) The duty to provide, to the extent technically feasible, number portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the Commission. 47 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 153(32): The term ‚Äúlocal exchange carrier‚Äù means any person that is engaged in the provision of telephone exchange service or exchange access. Such service providers may be the \\"customer of record\\" from the LEC's perspective. As a result, the applicable law may not require that such service provider port out the number to another provider. Users and providers often negotiate portability and port out fees. eFax is one vendor that claims it is not a telecommunications company and does not allow porting out of numbers originally assigned by them to their customers; however, numbers ported by customers into eFax may be ported out. A fax machine connected to its own physical telephone line at the subscriber's premises is portable in the same manner as any other standard wireline service. Distinctive ring sometimes poses problems, as one landline may have two or three numbers with a fax or dial-up modem programmed to answer just one of the secondary numbers on the line. Porting out the main number will usually unsubscribe the entire line, disconnecting the secondary numbers without moving them to the new provider. In Canada, pocket pager answering services are exempted from all local number portability requirements. The same is not true of mobile telephones, which are fully portable to another carrier or another service type (such as landline or voice over IP) within the same local interconnection region. Portability by country Africa =Kenya= The Communications Commission of Kenya announced in 2004 that mobile number portability would be available as of July 1, 2005 and fixed-line number portability as of July 1, 2006. Mobile Number Portability was officially launched on April 1, 2011. =South Africa= Number Portability Company (Pty) Ltd (Reg. No. 2005/040348/07) was established in 2005 and Mobile Number Portability was introduced on 10 November 2006. Geographic Number Portability (between fixed operators) was introduced on 26 April 2010. The Mobile Number Portability Company is jointly owned by the mobile and fixed operators including Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom and Neotel.http://www.number-portability.co.za/ The Americas =Argentina= In Argentina, full mobile number portability is available since March 2012, being a law approved in 2000. It originally took up to ten working days to be effective. Since July 2017, however, takes up to a 24-hour period to be effective. =Brazil= In Brazil, number portability (both fixed and mobile) is available nationwide since March, 2009. However, it's not possible to port a fixed line number to a mobile line number and vice versa . It's possible to carry the fixed line number within the same municipality and for mobile line number within the same area code (comprising from parts of a state to an entire state). =Canada= In Canada, wireline/competitive local exchange carriers must provide portability. As of March 14, 2007, wireless carriers must provide portability in most of Canada.Cellular (wireless) telephone services Numbers are only portable within a LIR (local interconnection region), regions defined by the ILEC and approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), each of which cover a number of exchanges. Each LIR has a Point of Interconnection (POI) exchange through which calls are routed, and if a number is ported out to a different LIR then calls to that destination will be rejected by the POI switch. Not all exchanges support LNP, typically there needs to exist competition within an exchange before an ILEC will enable portability, and then only by request. Most small local independent telephone company exchanges are exempted from competition and local number portability requirements. Numbers in the rarely used non-geographic area code 600 are not portable. =Dominican Republic= In the Dominican Republic, number portability in both mobile and local telephony was launched September 30, 2009. In March, 2009, the Dominican Telecommunications Institute (INDOTEL) selected Inform√°tica El Corte Ingl√©s to administer the number portability. =Ecuador= In Ecuador, Mobile Number Portability has been available since 12. October 2009. =Mexico= Mexico is the first Latin American country to have number portability in both mobile and local telephony. The Federal Commission of Telecommunications (COFETEL) applied this law, in defense and regulation of the Telmex monopoly. It was also a condition for Telmex for entering the video market triple play. Number portability has been available since July 5, 2008. The service was previously administered by Telcordia Technologies. On August 29, 2019, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) announced that, at the request of the telecommunications service providers, it would migrate its portability database administration to Mediafon Datapro, as a result, portability was temporarily suspended from August 30 to September 1. On September 2, portability was resumed with the service now being handled by Mediafon Datapro. =United States= In the United States, (b)(2), added by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, requires all local exchange carriers (LECs) to offer number portability in accordance with the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).11 FCC Rcd 8353 The FCC implemented regulations on 27 June 1996, with LECs required to implement them in the 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas by 1 October 1997 and elsewhere by 31 December 1998.11 FCC Rcd 8355 (The regulations are currently located at , et seq.) The North American Numbering Council (NANC) was directed to select the Local Number Portability Administrators (LNPAs), akin to the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA) which administers the North American Numbering Plan.11 FCC Rcd 8401 LNP was first implemented in the U.S. upon the establishment of the original Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) in Chicago, Illinois in 1998. This service covered select rate centers in the Ameritech region. Thereafter, as switches and telephone networks were upgraded with location routing number (LRN) capability, LNP was deployed sequentially to the remaining Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) areas. The U.S. FCC since has mandated Wireless Local Number Portability starting November 24, 2003 (in metropolitan areas), and allowed operators to charge an additional monthly Long-Term Telephone Number Portability End-Use Charge as compensation. On November 10, 2003, the FCC additionally ruled that number portability applies to landline numbers moving to mobile telephones and, on October 31, 2007, the FCC made clear that the obligation to provide LNP extends to VoIP providers. Toll-free telephone numbers (area code +1-800) have been portable through the RespOrg system since 1993 in the US10 FCC Rcd 12351 and 1994 in Canada. Asia =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong, fixed line number portability is available since July 1, 1995, the same day of fixed line telephone market liberalization (i.e., reversal of franchised monopoly), which was a requirement from the government. Mobile number portability is available since March 1, 1999. Although the government allowed porting a fixed line number to a mobile carrier or vice versa, the introduction of this service shall be decided by the fixed/mobile carriers in a voluntary basis. As of October 2009, fixed-mobile number portability is not available. =India= Mobile number portability launched in India in Haryana state on November 25, 2010. It was finally launched all over India on January 20, 2011. =Japan= In Japan, fixed line portability began in March, 2001. (bang≈ç portability seido ‚Äì commonly referred to as portability or MNP) began on October 24, 2006. Users are able to change cellular phone carriers without changing their number for a fee of 5000 yen. However, e-mail addresses are subject to change, and music/data downloaded may become unusable. The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) spent three years to put mobile number portability into practice, since its initial workgroup started in November, 2003. As a result, NTT DoCoMo, KDDI and Softbank accelerated the price battle, but it was of little effect due to already competitive price plans and customer loyalty. Overall, mobile number portability in Japan was not very successful, because of high transition costs for the customer due to SIM lock, the long time it took to establish mobile number portability, allowing operators to fence in subscribers with price plans, and the significance of mobile Internet mail. =Malaysia= In Malaysia, mobile number portability plan to start by mid-2008, according to an article on the National News Agency Bernama =Pakistan= In Pakistan, () the PTA mandated mobile number portability on March 23, 2007. Users are able to change their cellular phone service for free. They just have to pay for new sim cards depending upon the provider they are migrating. Some companies even do not charge anything.http://www.pta.gov.pk/media/Code_of_practic_22-03-2007.pdf =Singapore= Singapore was one of the first countries to introduce number portability for mobile telephones in 1997. This is currently implemented through voice call & SMS forwarding. True number portability was realized from June 13, 2008, with the implementation of a Centralised Number Portability Database Solution, as proposed by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore. =South Korea= In South Korea, mobile number portability service started from January 1, 2004. One thing different from other countries is that it started from SK Telecom, the dominant operator which has over 50% of market share. To prevent users' churning to the dominant operator, the government gave six months' and one year's delay to the second and the third operator, respectively. As a result, only SK Telecom's subscribers could move to other operators during the first six months. = Sri Lanka = The Sri Lankan government made a policy decision in August 2007 to introduce number portability for cellular phones in Sri Lanka. This is supported by Sri Lanka Telecom owned Mobitel Lanka and other cellular operators. Europe In the European Union, all telephone providers are required to provide number portability under the Universal Services Directive (2002/22/EU). Albania In Albania, mobile number portability was implemented in 04.05.2011 (AKEP). While for Fixed line numbers it started on some geographical areas in September 2012 and was available in all country by 01.04.2013 (AKEP). =Austria= In Austria, number portability was implemented in Oct 2004. =Belgium= In Belgium, number portability was implemented in Oct 2002. =Cyprus= In Cyprus, geographic, non-geographic and mobile number portability is required as of July 12, 2004. =Denmark= In Denmark, portability of fixed line numbers and ISDN was implemented on January 1, 2001. Mobile number portability was implemented on July 1, 2001. In 2006, 238,293 fixed lines were ported, along with 456,159 mobile lines. Considering that the number of fixed lines by the end of 2006 was 2,974,000 and the number of mobile lines was 5.828.000, roughly 7.9% of lines were ported in 2006. =Estonia= In Estonia, number portability is required from fixed operators since January 1, 2004 and should be required from mobile operators as from January 1, 2005. =Finland= In Finland, mobile number portability was implemented on July 25, 2003. The impact of mobile number portability in Finland exceeds that of other countries. In one year (June 2003 ‚Äì June 2004), the combined market share of TeliaSonera, Elisa and DNA fell from 98.7% to 87.9%. =France= In France, geographic number portability has been available since January 1, 1998. As of January 1, 2001, it became possible to change geographic location or operator while keeping the same number. Mobile number portability was introduced on June 30, 2003. However, due to its lack of effectiveness, a new system was launched on May 21, 2007 with two objectives: having a single contact for the customer (the new operator should take all the steps towards mobile number portability) and a maximum period of ten days for mobile number portability to have effect. =Germany= In Germany, fixed number portability was introduced on January 1, 1998, for geographic numbers and numbers for non- geographic services. Mobile number portability was implemented on November 1, 2002. =Greece= In Greece, fixed number portability is available since January 1, 2003. Mobile number portability was implemented on March 1, 2004. =Hungary= In Hungary, portability exists for geographic numbers since January 1, 2004. Portability for non-geographic numbers (including mobile numbers) is available since May 1, 2004. There has been added a special area code +36 21, which legally allows the phone number to be anywhere in the world, beside having the +36 country code prefix. =Ireland= In Ireland, local number portability was implemented in 2000, using an IN solution with a shared routing database. Partial mobile number portability was introduced in 1997 with full portability becoming available in 2003. =Italy= In Italy, mobile number portability is available since April 30, 2002. = Luxembourg = MNP was introduced in Luxembourg in June 2004. The Mobile Number Portability Central (MNPC) managed by the G.I.E Telcom E.I.G. operator group and developed, installed and operated by Systor Trondheim AS of Norway, was put into commercial operations from February 2005. = Norway = Fixed number portability was introduced in Norway in 2000, one year before the introduction of mobile number portability. The administrative solution for fixed and mobile number portability in Norway, the National Reference Database (NRDB), was put into service in 2000. The NRDB is owned and managed by the 8 largest network operators in Norway through the company NRDB AS. The reference database was developed, installed and is presently operated by Systor Trondheim AS. =Portugal= In Portugal, fixed number portability was implemented on June 30, 2001. Mobile number portability has been available since January 1, 2002. The administrative Reference Entity (Entidade de Referencia (ER)) interconnecting all network operators and service providers is operated by a local third party, Portabil S.A., a joint venture between the internationally well known companies Logica and Systor Trondheim AS. =Slovakia= In Slovakia, number portability was implemented in May 2004. =Spain= In Spain, number portability among cell phone carriers is available since October 1, 2000, without any cost to the end user. The technical details for the process are regulated by the CMT (Comisi√≥n del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones or Telecoms Market Commission) and all carriers are obliged to comply with their requirements. As of August 2007, cell number portability must complete in 5 business days (i.e. excluding weekends) from the moment the request is confirmed by the customer, with the actual switch occurring late at night to avoid missing any calls. The user wakes up using a new SIM-card from the new cell provider while keeping the number. In the mature Spanish cell phone market (as of June 2007, with 107 lines per 100 inhabitants ), portability has been widely used by the competing carriers as a way to steal each other's customers, usually offering them free handsets or extra credit. From June 2006 to June 2007 alone, 3,957,556 cell phone lines switched carriers via this proceeding, about 10% of all cellular lines in use. Spain is the one country in the European Union where more customers have switched cell phone providers, with more than 9 million carrier switches completed as of April 2007. As for the fixed line market, number portability is also available since year 2000, but weaker competition meant that actual adoption of the fixed number portability process was quite sluggish. As of August 2004, 1,041,246 fixed line switches were completed.Consumer magazine (in Spanish) Fixed line market is peculiar in Spain, since only two local loop providers can operate at each particular region (or demarcaci√≥n as regulated by the CMT): a cable carrier (such as Ono, R and many others) and the former State monopoly (Telef√≥nica). The sole of them operating statewide‚ÄîTelef√≥nica‚Äîis obliged to provide other firms with access to their exchange facilities or rental/transfer of their copper last- mile loops, at fees regulated by the CMT (practice known as local loop unbundling). As cable providers do not have a statewide footprint, many users have no actual chance of applying for \\"true\\" fixed number portability, that is, giving up Telef√≥nica's service altogether. Some of them can however get their service from a third company who will bill the service and then pay Telef√≥nica for the copper pair rental and maintenance fees, with the customer receiving a single bill. In the end, as Telef√≥nica set up a reselling program for their fixed lines and DSL internet access, the former monopoly is still much in control of the fixed line market, including profitable broadband access. In fact, Telef√≥nica was fined in excess of ‚Ç¨152 million by the European Commission on July 4, 2007 on ground of \\"impeding competition on the Spanish broadband internet access market for more than five years, and so depriving consumers and business of a choice of broadband suppliers\\".Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for Competition Policy; Press conference on Telef√≥nica decision, Brussels, July 4, 2007 Due to the billing scheme used throughout Europe and most of the world, where the calling party assumes the full cost of the call, and calling a cellphone is usually more expensive than calling a fixed line, a distinction must be made between cellphone numbers (beginning with \\"6\\" or, from October 2011, \\"71\\", \\"72\\", \\"73\\" or \\"74\\", ) and fixed numbers (usually beginning with 9 or 8). Full number portability in which a customer transfers a cell to a fixed number or vice versa is thus not possible. See Telephone numbering in Spain for more information. =Sweden= In Sweden, fixed line portability was implemented in 1999 and mobile number portability was implemented on September 1, 2001. At the introduction of mobile number portability the Swedish operators joined forces and procured a central solution, SNPAC CRDB, which is a central reference database now containing both the fixed and mobile portings. =Switzerland= In Switzerland, mobile number portability is available since November 1, 2015. = Turkey = In Turkey, mobile number portability was implemented in Nov 2008. Fixed number portability was initially planned to take place exactly 6 months following the mobile number portability, on May 9, 2009. However, it was not until September 9, 2009 that the regulator approved the procedure for fixed number portability. Since then, fixed and mobile operators, and the incumbent, are working to get the process going and performing interoperability tests. However, there is still progress to be made and the progress for fixed number portability has not proved to be going ahead as in-time as the mobile number portability. . =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, Ofcom directs fixed-line telephone network providers, mobile phone providers and broadband service providers to provide number portability under the Porting Authorisation Code rules and Migration Authorisation Code code of practice respectively. As the UK is an EU member country, the Ofcom direction is intended to reflect the requirements of EU Directive 2002/22/EU. =Serbia= The number portability service on public telephone networks at a fixed location is available as of 1 April 2014. Middle East =Israel= In Israel, number portability is free and takes 15 minutes. All cellular lines can be ported, Landline numbers may be ported, except between regions (area codes). Wireless and VoIP companies each have a single area code for the whole country. Within it, numbers may be ported with no regard to geographic area. There is no porting between landline and cellular lines. (date implemented? http://www.moc.gov.il/new/documents/engineering/faq_24.8.05.pdf ) =Oman= In Oman, Mobile Number Portability was mandated on the Public Mobile Operators, Nawras and Oman Mobile, via the licenses issued to them by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). Mobile number portability was launched on August 26, 2006. Users are able to change cellular phone carriers without changing their number for a nominal fee of 3 OMR. =Saudi Arabia= In Saudi Arabia, MNP was launched on July 8, 2006, to be the first country to launch this service in the ME region. A centralized number portability clearinghouse (NPC) solution was implemented by CITC(the telecom regulation authority) and the two mobile phone operators were obliged to implement the MNP solution in their networks and to interface with the NPC. the service was provided to the mobile subscribers for free. Oceania =Australia= In Australia, local telephone numbers have been portable since 1999. The porting process is based on a peer-to-peer file exchange between fixed line operators. According to ACMA, local number portability came into full effect at the start of 2000. Mobile number portability has been available as of September 25, 2001. For service providers who require knowledge of porting activity to enable them to deliver voice calls directly to the current \\"network owner\\", they can either form agreements with all of the fixed-line operators, or use a third-party LNP provider, such as Paradigm.One. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, local and mobile number portability (LMNP) began on April 1, 2007. The rules governing LMNP originate in the Number Portability Determination. Ports are authorised, scheduled, and coordinated via a centralised number portability system called IPMS (Industry Portability Management System). All networks update their own routing and confirm this to IPMS. There are now 26 carriers and service providers that participate in LMNP in New Zealand, over a million numbers have been ported.

The tool is most likely derived from tongs, pincers, or scissors-like pliers used to grab or hold hot objects since the dawn of recorded history. In a scientific or medical context they are normally referred to as forceps. Tweezers make use of two third-class levers connected at one fixed end (the fulcrum point of each lever), with the pincers at the others. People commonly use tweezers mainly for tasks such as plucking hair from the face or eyebrows, often using the term eyebrow tweezers. Other common uses for tweezers are as a tool to manipulate small objects, including for example small, particularly surface-mount, electronic parts, and small mechanical parts for models and precision mechanisms. Stamp collectors use tweezers (stamp tongs) to handle postage stamps which, while large enough to pick up by hand, could be damaged by handling; the jaws of stamp tongs are smooth. One example of a specialised use is picking out flakes of gold in gold panning. Tweezers are also used in kitchens for food presentationArchived article about food decoration with tweezers in high-end restaurants Source (Multilanguage): Developers Tocan-Tweezer.org Sourceforge project. (CC-BY-SA) to remove bones from fillets of fish in a process known as pin boning. History Gold tweezers recovered from the Royal Cemetery of Ur, Iraq 2550-2450 B.C. A pair of bronze tweezers attributed to the Minoan civilization, circa 2900‚Äì1050 B.C. Tweezers are known to have been used in predynastic Egypt. There are drawings of Egyptian craftsmen holding hot pots over ovens with a double-bow shaped tool. Asiatic tweezers, consisting of two strips of metal brazed together, were commonly used in Mesopotamia and India from about 3000 BC, perhaps for purposes such as catching lice. During the bronze age, tweezers were manufactured in Kerma. The word tweezer comes from etwee which describes a small case that people would use to carry small objects (such as toothpicks) with them. Etwee takes its origin from French √©tui \\"small case\\" from the Old French verb estuier, \\"to hold or keep safe.\\" Over time, the object now known as \\"tweezers\\" took on this name because the tool was commonly found in these tiny carrying cases. Eventually, the word \\"tweeze\\" was accepted as a verb in the English language. There is evidence of Roman shipbuilders pulling nails out of construction with plier-type pincers. Types Flat tip conventional tweezers A pair of modern-day round-tipped tweezers Tweezers come in a variety of tip shapes and sizes. Blunt tip tweezers have a rounded end which can be used when a pointed object may get entangled, when manipulating cotton swabs, for example. Flat tip tweezers, pictured at right, have an angled tip which may be used for removing splinters. Some tweezers have a long needle-like tip which may be useful for reaching into small crevices. Triangular tip tweezers have larger, wider tips useful for gripping larger objects. Tweezers with curved tips also exist, sometimes called bent forceps. Microtweezers have an extremely small, pointed tip used for manipulating tiny electronic components and the like. There are two common forms of construction for tweezers: two fused, angled pieces of metal, or one piece of metal bent in half. The bent tweezer is cheaper to manufacture, but gives weaker grip. The fused tweezer is more expensive, but allows for a stronger grip. The width between the tips of the tweezers when no force is applied also affects how powerful the grip is. Cross-locking tweezers (aka reverse-action tweezers or self-closing tweezers) work in the opposite way to normal tweezers. Cross-locking tweezers open when squeezed and close when released, gripping the item without any exertion of the user's fingers. Classification by usage Applications: * in lead type * in dealing with stamps (see Philately) * in dealing with smaller coins (see Numismatics), to protect the coins these are wrapped at the tips with plastic * in electronics * for hair removal (eyebrow tweezers) * in semiconductor technology in the form of wafer tweezers * in cosmetics * in medicine (Forceps and Tissue Forceps) * in the household * in jewelry * In the textile industry as iron nubs * in soldering * in science, laboratory * in aquatics at planting e.g. Aquascaping * in watchmaker usage * There are also other tweezers, for example, so-called optical tweezers and vacuum tweezers to the tweezers. The original tweezers for mechanical gripping have given rise to a number of tools with similar action or purpose but not dependent upon mechanical pressure, including *Optical tweezers use light to manipulate microscopic objects as small as a single atom. The momentum transfer from a focused laser beam is able to trap small particles.Ashkin, Arthur, et al. \\"Observation of a single- beam gradient force optical trap for dielectric particles.\\" Optics letters 11.5 (1986): 288-290. In the biological sciences, these instruments have been used to apply forces in the pico Newton range and to measure displacements in the nm range of objects ranging in size from 10 nm to over 100 mm. *Magnetic tweezers use magnetic forces to manipulate single molecules (such as DNA) via paramagnetic interactions. In practice it is an array of magnetic traps designed for manipulating individual biomolecules and measuring the ultra- small forces that affect their behavior. Plastic tweezers used in first aid kit *Electric tweezers deliver an electrical signal through the tip, intended for depilation by damaging hair roots to prevent new hair from growing from the same root. *Vacuum tweezers use differences in atmospheric pressure to grasp items from 100 micrometres in size up to parts weighing several pounds. Special vacuum tweezer tips are manufactured to handle a wide variety of items such as surface-mount electronics, optics, biological material, stamps and coins. They may be used to handle parts that are so small that conventional mechanical tweezers may cause parts to be damaged or dropped and lost. *Molecular tweezers are noncyclic host molecules that have two arms capable of binding guests molecules through non-covalent bonding. * Hot, or soldering, tweezers combine the squeezing action of mechanical tweezers with heating, to grip small surface-mount electronic devices while simultaneously heating them, for soldering or desoldering. * Tweezer probes are a pair of electrical test probes fixed to a tweezer mechanism to measure voltages or other electronic circuit parameters between closely spaced pins. * Tweezers integrated with an electronic measuring device for evaluation of electrical parameters of small- size electronic components. * Carbon nano-tweezers have been fabricated by deposition of MWNT bundles on isolated electrodes deposited on tempered glass micropipettes. Those nanotube bundles can be mechanically manipulated by electricity and can be used to manipulate and transfer micro- and nano- structures. The nanotube bundles used for tweezers are about 50 nm in diameter and 2 ¬µm in lengths. Under electric bias, two close sets of bundles are attracted and can be used as nanoscale tweezers. Other uses of the same principle are named tweezers; although such terms are not necessarily widely used their meaning is clear to people in the relevant field. E.g., Raman tweezers, which combine Raman spectroscopy with optical tweezers.

It is found in cold, high latitude waters of the North Pacific where it is among the most numerous squid species recorded. There are three recognised subspecies of B. magister. The type locality of all three is Japan, although specimens have been recorded as far east as the Aleutian Islands.  Description  The cylindrical bodies of magister armhook squid are muscular with very soft reddish brown skin. Like all gonatids, the suckers of their arms are arranged in four rows or series. But unlike other gonatids it is in females only that the suckers are modified into hooks; these hooks are on the mesial rows of the dorsal arms only. The clubs at the end of both tentacles are covered in 20 rows of suckers; these are smaller in B. magister nipponensis. The wing-like fins at the rear of the body are rather large and may reach up to 50 percent of the mantle length. The fins are also smaller in B. magister nipponensis. B. magister magister is known to reach a mantle length of ; total body length may exceed . Both B. magister nipponensis and B. magister shevtsovi are somewhat smaller, with a maximum mantle length of . Females are slightly larger than males.

Like other species in their family, Magister Armhook Squids are thought to undertake diel migration; by day the squid remain in the blackness of the depths. By night, they ascend to the upper layers of the water column to feed by starlight. An internal balancing organ called a statocyst ensures graceful movement. Magister armhook squid prey upon both benthic and pelagic species; sculpins, smaller fish such as Sablefish and juvenile pollock, crustaceans including euphausiids and amphipods, and other squid. Cannibalism is also known to occur among the Magisters. Baird's beaked whale, the short-finned pilot whale, false killer whale, Dall's porpoise and sperm whales are all known to feed upon magister armhook squid. Other predators include seabirds, northern fur seals, grenadiers, halibut and several species of salmon.

The name of the district means \\"great safety\\" or \\"great peace\\".  History  The district is named after Daiwan village () that was once located near the intersection of present-day Xinyi Road and Fuxing S. Road. The name was changed in the 1800s (during the Qing era) to the more auspicious but similar- sounding \\"Daan\\" (Â§ßÂÆâ; ).http://english.taipei.gov.tw/daan/index.jsp?categid=834&recordid;=436 In 1875, the setup of Taipeh Prefecture put the village together with ‰∏ãÂÖßÂüî and LaÃçk-tiu‚Åø-l√™ (ÂÖ≠ÂºµÁäÅ), all of which are within today's Daan District. During Japanese rule, Daan village was merged with , , and . In 1945, after World War II, Daan District was drawn from an area centered on Daan village and took its name. Further significant changes occurred in the 1990s.  Geography  Daan is bounded on the east by Guangfu South Road, Keelung Road and Heping East Road; on the south by Neipu, Fuzhou and Toad Hills, and the Xinhai and Zhuangjing Tunnels; in the west by Roosevelt Road, Hangzhou South Road, Xinyi Road and Xinsheng South Road; and in the north by Civic Boulevard. It is bordered by Xinyi District to the east, Wenshan District to the south, Zhongzheng District to the west, Zhongshan District to the northwest, and Songshan District to the northeast.http://english.taipei.gov.tw/daan/index.jsp?categid=704 Government institutions left * Industrial Development Bureau * Maritime and Port Bureau * Ministry of Science and Technology * Securities and Futures Bureau * Small and Medium Enterprise Administration * Taiwan Intellectual Property Office * Transitional Justice Commission  Education  Daan is the home of three major national universities: National Taiwan University (NTU), National Taiwan University of Science and Technology and National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU).

The road is also known as Trail Ridge Road/Beaver Meadow National Scenic Byway. Trail Ridge Road is closed during the winter, and often remains closed until late spring or early summer depending on the snowpack. The Trail Ridge Road is the highest paved through road in Colorado and it is also the highest paved road in Colorado that crosses the continental divide (Cottonwood Pass at 12,126 feet is the second highest, and Colorado State Highway 82 at 12,095 feet going through Independence Pass is the third highest).

There are several trailheads along this section of the road, notably the Colorado River Trailhead, which is the western terminus of the road segment closed during the winter. The road crosses the Continental Divide at Milner Pass (elev. ) and reaches a maximum elevation of , near Fall River Pass (elev. ). Near the highest point on the road is another pass, Iceberg Pass (elev. ). According to construction contracts and park maintenance files the east end of the road is located at the Fall River Entrance, however some guides state that earlier - at Deer Ridge Junction. Trail Ridge is a high flat spur range extending east from the main range of the Rockies between Fall River in the North and the Big Thompson River in the South. The road follows Trail Ridge from the Fall River Pass near Alpine Visitor Center to the Deer Ridge Junction. Trail Ridge Road - elevation profile, based on elevation values obtained from Google Maps Elevation Service (m/km here). History Fall River Road was the first road into the park's high country. It opened in 1921 and quickly proved inadequate for motor travel as a single-track road with steep grades (up to 16%), tight curves and a short annual season due to snowpack. Construction began in 1929 and was complete to Fall River Pass by July 1932, with a maximum grade of 7%. The road was complete through the Kawuneeche Valley to Grand Lake in 1938. The route followed what was known to local Arapaho Indians as the Dog Trail. Internal opposition to the construction of a road through the park's alpine tundra was overruled by National Park Service director Horace Albright, who wished to encourage park visitation. The road was designed to intrude as little as possible into the landscape, in accordance with Park Service design principles. Hidden Valley (or Ski Estes Park) was a local ski area attraction from 1955 - 1991, off of Trail Ridge Road, now defunct.Colorado Ski History: Hidden Valley (Ski Estes Park) Before the road was constructed Trail Ridge had been used by Native Americans to cross the mountains between their home lands in the west and hunting areas on the east side. Arapahoe Indians called the trail located on the ridge as \\"taienbaa\\" (\\"Where the Children Walked\\") because it was so steep that children could not be carried, but had to walk. The Ute tribe crossing the mountains at Forest Canyon Pass marked their route with stone cairns. The present park Ute Trail follows partially that ancient route. On the west side, about 1880, a wagon road was constructed along the Kawuneeche Valley from the town of Grand Lake to the mining camps of Lulu City and Gaskill. The camps were abandoned after a few years when short-lived mining boom ended and later the road was used only occasionally by hunters and tourists.

Early life and marriage Clarice Vance was born in Ohio in 1870. She began her career in farce comedy in the early 1890s and was such a hit singing the songs interpolated into plot that she quickly won fame, singing ragtime and dialect songs as a single. When she performed with the James and Bonnie Thornton troop, he coined her, \\"The Southern Singer\\". She married \\"Mose\\" Gumble, head of Remick Music Publishing in New York, in 1904, but divorced him in 1914. Gumble was a well known songwriter along with his brother, Albert, but is remembered today as the man who gave George Gershwin his first job plugging songs at Remick. According to the 1900 census, this well known marriage was preceded by a marriage to William A. Sims who served briefly as her manager. According to the New York Clipper she was granted a divorce from John Blanchard in early 1904. This was followed by her marriage to Gumble. Recent research into Pike County, Ohio census records indicate that Clarice's mother's name was Mary Vance, solving the riddle of her stage name. Her middle name was actually \\"Etta\\" not Ella. This was confirmed by Sterling Morris after obtaining a copy of the original notice in Variety of her marriage to Gumble in 1904. The New York Times archives reveal that Vance later married Phelps Decker, a screen scenario writer and for a short time, manager in the New York offices of Universal Pictures.

Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species.Bold, H. C. 1967. Morphology of Plants. second ed. Harper and Row, New York. p. 225-229. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, sphagnum can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing sphagnum as 'habitat manipulators'.Walker, M. D. 2019. Sphagnum: the biology of a habitat manipulator. Sicklebrook Publishing, Sheffield, U.K. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.Keddy, P. A. (2010). Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 397 pp. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species. Individual peat moss plants consist of a main stem, with tightly arranged clusters of branch fascicles usually consisting of two or three spreading branches and two to four hanging branches. The top of the plant, or capitulum, has compact clusters of young branches. Along the stem are scattered leaves of various shapes, named stem leaves; the shape varies according to species. The leaves consist of two kinds of cells: small, green, living cells (chlorophyllose cells), and large, clear, structural, dead cells (hyaline cells). The latter have the large water-holding capacity. Sphagnum structure Sphagnum have a distinct structure adapted to the watery habitats they live in. The water supports Sphagnum plants, making other strengthening structures unnecessary. The top of the plant is called the capitulum, a rosette of leaves which gather the majority of the plant's energy through photosynthesis. The main body consists of a stem and branches, with leaves also protruding from both the stem and the branches. The lowermost parts of the plant are dead and decomposing underground. Cellular structure Sphagnum cells Sphagnum has a distinctive cellular structure. Mosses have no vascular system to move water and nutrients around the plant. Thus tissues are thin and usually one cell thick to allow these to diffuse easily. Sphagnum mosses have two distinct cell types. There are normal photosynthesising cells with chlorophyll. Additionally there are larger Aline or retort cells. These are barrel shaped. They have pores and soak up water like a sponge. These unique cells mean Sphagnum can keep the habitat watery by releasing water to keep bogs waterlogged. Walker (2019) describes Sphagnum thus as 'habitat manipulators'. Lifecycle Sphagnum, like all other land plants, has an alternation of generations; like other bryophytes, the haploid gametophyte generation is dominant and persistent. Unlike other mosses, the long-lived gametophytes do not rely upon rhizoids to assist in water uptake. Sphagnum species can be unisexual (male or female, dioecious) or bisexual (male and female gametes produced from the same plant; monoecious); In North America, 80% of Sphagnum species are unisexual.Andrus, Richard. Sphagnum. Flora of North America. 2007 Gametophytes have substantial asexual reproduction by fragmentation, producing much of the living material in sphagnum peatlands.Rydin, Hakan and Jeglum, John K. 2006. Biology of Peatlands. Oxford University Press, Oxford. Swimming sperm fertilize eggs contained in archegonia that remain attached to the female gametophyte. The sporophyte is relatively short-lived, and consists almost entirely of a shiny green, spherical spore capsule that becomes black with spores. Sporophytes are raised on stalks to facilitate spore dispersal, but unlike other mosses, Sphagnum stalks are produced by the maternal gametophyte. Tetrahedral haploid spores are produced in the sporophyte by meiosis, which are then dispersed when the capsule explosively discharges its cap, called an operculum, and shoots the spores some distance. The spores germinate to produce minute protonemae, which start as filaments, can become thalloid, and can produce a few rhizoids. Soon afterwards, the protonema develops buds and these differentiate into its characteristic, erect, leafy, branched gametophyte with chlorophyllose cells and hyaline cells.Schofield, W. B. 1985. Introduction to Bryology. Macmillan Publ. Co., N.Y. & London This stage dominates the environment where Sphagnum grows, obliterating and burying the protonema and eventually building up into layers of dead moss called peat. Carpets of living Sphagnum may be attacked by various fungi, and one fungus that is also a mushroom, Sphagnurus paluster, produces conspicuous dead patches. When this fungus and other agarics attack the protonema, Sphagnum is induced to produce nonphotosynthetic gemmae that can survive the fungal attack and months later germinate to produce new protonema and leafy gametophytes. It is unknown whether the leafy stage can produce such gemmae. Taxonomy and phylogeny Peat moss can be distinguished from other moss species by its unique branch clusters. The plant and stem color, the shape of the branch and stem leaves, and the shape of the green cells are all characteristics used to identify peat moss to species. Sphagnum taxonomy has been very contentious since the early 1900s; most species require microscopic dissection to be identified. In the field, most Sphagnum species can be identified to one of four major sections of the genus‚Äîclassification and descriptions follow Andrus 2007 (Flora North America): right *Sphagnum sect. Acutifolia plants generally form hummocks above the water line, usually colored orange or red. Examples: Sphagnum fuscum and Sphagnum warnstorfii. *Sphagnum sect. Cuspidata plants are usually found in hollows, lawns, or are aquatic, and are green. Examples: Sphagnum cuspidatum and Sphagnum flexuosum. *Sphagnum sect. Sphagnum plants have the largest gametophytes among the sections, forming large hummocks, their leaves form cuculate (hood-shaped) apices, and are green, except for Sphagnum magellanicum Example: Sphagnum austinii. *Sphagnum sect. Subsecunda plants vary in color from green to yellow and orange (but never red), and are found in hollows, lawns, or are aquatic. Species always with unisexual gametophytes. Examples: Sphagnum lescurii and Sphagnum pylaesii. The reciprocal monophyly of these sections and two other minor ones (Rigida and Squarrosa) has been clarified using molecular phylogenetics. All but two species normally identified as Sphagnum reside in one clade; two other species have recently been separated into new families within the Sphagnales reflecting an ancestral relationship with the Tasmanian endemic Ambuchanania and long phylogenetic distance to the rest of Sphagnum. Within main clade of Sphagnum, phylogenetic distance is relatively short, and molecular dating methods suggest nearly all current Sphagnum species are descended from a radiation that occurred just 14 million years ago. Geographic distribution Sphagnum with northern pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea) at Brown's Lake Bog, Ohio Sphagnum mosses occur mainly in the Northern Hemisphere in peat bogs, conifer forests, and moist tundra areas. Their northernmost populations lie in the archipelago of Svalbard, Arctic Norway, at 81¬∞ N. In the Southern Hemisphere, the largest peat areas are in southern Chile and Argentina, part of the vast Magellanic moorland (circa 44,000 square km).Arroyo, M.T.K., P. Mihoc, P. Pliscoff and M. Arroyo-Kalin. (2005). The Magellanic moorland. P. 424-445 in L.H. Fraser and P.A. Keddy (eds.). The World's Largest Wetlands: Ecology and Conservation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. Peat areas are also found in New Zealand and Tasmania. In the Southern Hemisphere, however, peat landscapes may contain many moss species other than Sphagnum. Sphagnum species are also reported from \\"dripping rocks\\" in mountainous, subtropical Brazil. Spore dispersal As with many other mosses, Sphagnum species disperse spores through the wind. The tops of spore capsules are only about 1 cm above ground, and where wind is weak. As the spherical spore capsule dries, the operculum is forced off, followed by a cloud of spores. The exact mechanism has traditionally attributed to a \\"pop gun\\" method using air compressed in the capsule, reaching a maximum velocity of 3.6 meters per second, but alternative mechanisms have been recently proposed. High-speed photography has shown vortex rings are created during the discharge, which enable the spores to reach a height of 10 to 20 cm, further than would be expected by ballistics alone. The acceleration of the spores is about 36,000G. Spores are extremely important in establishment of new populations in disturbed habitats and on islands. Uses Peat moss soil amendment, made of partly decayed, dried sphagnum moss Decayed, dried sphagnum moss has the name of peat or peat moss. This is used as a soil conditioner which increases the soil's capacity to hold water and nutrients by increasing capillary forces and cation exchange capacity ‚Äì uses that are particularly useful in gardening. This is often necessary when dealing with very sandy soil, or plants that need increased or steady moisture content to flourish. A distinction is sometimes made between sphagnum moss, the live moss growing on top of a peat bog, and 'sphagnum peat moss' (North American usage) or 'sphagnum peat' (British usage), the latter being the slowly decaying matter underneath.Hood, Gerry (January 1995). \\"Don't Confuse Sphagnum Moss with Peat Moss\\". African Violet Magazine, p. 34 Dried sphagnum moss is used in northern Arctic regions as an insulating material. Anaerobic acidic sphagnum bogs have low rates of decay, and hence preserve plant fragments and pollen to allow reconstruction of past environments. They even preserve human bodies for millennia; examples of these preserved specimens are Tollund Man, Haraldsk√¶r Woman, Clonycavan Man and Lindow Man. Such bogs can also preserve human hair and clothing, one of the most noteworthy examples being Egtved Girl, Denmark. Because of the acidity of peat, however, bones are dissolved rather than preserved. These bogs have also been used to preserve food.Madrigal, Alexis. Bogosphere: The Strangest Things Pulled Out of Peat Bogs. Wired Magazine. 21 August 2009 Up to 2000-year-old containers of butter or lard have been found.Bog Butter Test. New Scientist. 20 March 2004. Sphagnum moss wound dressings being made at the University of Toronto c. 1914 Sphagnum moss has also been used for centuries as a dressing for wounds, including through World War I. Since it is absorptive and extremely acidic, it inhibits growth of bacteria and fungi, so it is used for shipping seeds and live plants. Peat moss is used to dispose of the clarified liquid output (effluent) from septic tanks in areas that lack the proper conditions for ordinary disposal means. It is also used as an environmentally friendly alternative to chlorine in swimming pool sanitation.Moss Proving An Alternative To Chlorine In Pools. WCCO. 15 August 2008. The moss inhibits the growth of microbes and reduces the need for chlorine in swimming pools.Hill, Catey. Time to fire the pool boy? Moss helps pools stay clean. Daily News. 29 October 2009. Conservation Mer Bleue Conservation Area, a large, protected Sphagnum bog near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada Several of the world's largest wetlands are sphagnum-dominated bogs, including the West Siberian Lowland, the Hudson Bay Lowland and the Mackenzie River Valley. These areas provide habitat for common and rare species. They also store large amounts of carbon, which helps reduce global warming.Fraser, L. H. and P. A. Keddy (eds.). 2005. The World's Largest Wetlands: Ecology and Conservation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. p. 488 The U.S. gets up to 80% of sphagnum peat moss it uses from Canada. In Canada, the peat bog mass harvested each year is an estimated 1/60th of the mass that accumulates. About 0.02% of the 1.1 million km2 (422,000 square miles) of Canadian peat bog are used for peat moss mining.Trail, Jesse Vernon. The truth about peat moss. The Ecologist. 25 January 2013. Some efforts are being made to restore peat bogs after peat mining, and some debate exists as to whether the peat bogs can be restored to their premining condition and how long the process takes. \\"The North American Wetlands Conservation Council estimates that harvested peatlands can be restored to 'ecologically balanced systems' within five to 20 years after peat harvesting.\\" Some wetlands scientists assert that \\"a managed bog bears little resemblance to a natural one. Like tree farms, these peatlands tend toward monoculture, lacking the biodiversity of an unharvested bog.\\"Priesnitz, Wendy. \\"Ask Natural Life: Does Peat Moss Have a Place In the Ecological Garden\\". Natural Life Magazine. 1 July 2012. PittMoss, a peat moss alternative made from recycled newspaper, has emerged as a sustainable substitute in growing media.Cellulose Based Soil Medium as a Peat Moss Substitute EPA/SBIR Sponsored (Contract No. 68D60035)(C) 1997 Wabash Vallet Products, Inc. Crown Point, Indiana. Coir has also been touted as a sustainable alternative to peat moss in growing media.Richards, Davi. Coir is sustainable alternative to peat moss in the garden. Oregon State University Extension Service. Another peat moss alternative is manufactured in California from sustainably harvested redwood fiber. Semi-open cell polyurethane materials available in flaked and sheet stock are also finding application as sphagnum replacements with typical usage in green wall and roof garden substrates. Chile In the 2010s Sphagnum peat in Chile has begun to be harvested at large scales for export to countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Given Sphagnums property to absorb excess water and release it during dry months harvesting of Sphagnum, means that overexploitation may threaten the water supply in the fjords and channels of Chile. Extraction of Sphagnum in Chile is regulated by law since 2 August 2018. Since 2018 Chilean law allows only for the manual extraction of Sphagnum using only pitchforks or similar tools as aid. In a given area (polygon) at least 30% of Sphagnum coverage has to be left unharvested. Harvested Sphagnum fibers may not exceed 15 cm in length and the remaining Sphagnum after harvest may never have a length less than 5 cm over the water table. In the regions of Los R√≠os (40¬∞S) and Los Lagos (41‚Äì43¬∞S) the same plots may be harvested after 12 years, while further south in Ays√©n (44‚Äì48¬∞S) and Magallanes (49‚Äì56¬∞S) 85 years have to pass before the same area is harvested again. Havrvesting aside, bogs where Sphagnum grows have also come under threat by the development of wind farms in cool humid areas such as Cordillera del Piuch√©n were the San Pedro Wind Farm was constructed in the 2010s. The edification of each wind turbine usually imply the removal of vegetation and the alteration of the soil changing by the way also the local hydrology. Europe Europe has a long history of the exploitation of peatlands. The Netherlands, for example, once had large areas of peatland, both fen and bog. Between 100 AD and the present, they were drained and converted to agricultural land. The English broadlands have small lakes that originated as peat mines. More than 90% of the bogs in England have been damaged or destroyed.Insight into threatened peat bogs. BBC News.The RSPB: Policy A handful of bogs has been preserved through government buyouts of peat-mining interests.Jeffery, Simon. Bogs to be preserved for peat's sake. The Guardian. 27 February 2002. Over longer time scales, however, some parts of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have seen expansion of bogs, particularly blanket bogs, in response to deforestation and abandonment of agricultural land. New Zealand New Zealand has, like other parts of the world, lost large areas of peatland; the latest estimates for wetland loss in New Zealand are 90% over 150 years.Peters, M. and Clarkson, B. 2010. Wetland Restoration: A Handbook for New Zealand Freshwater Systems. Manaaki Whenua Press, Lincoln, N.Z. (online) In some cases, better care is taken during the harvesting of Sphagnum to ensure enough moss is remaining to allow regrowth. An 8-year cycle is suggested, but some sites require a longer cycle of 11 to 32 years for full recovery of biomass, depending on factors including whether reseeding is done, light intensity, and the water table.Sphagnum research programme: the ecological effects of commercial harvesting Department of Conservation R. P. Buxton, P. N. Johnson and P. R. Espie. Wellington, N.Z.

Most harvesting in New Zealand swamps is done only using pitchforks without the use of heavy machinery. During transportation, helicopters are commonly employed to transfer the newly harvested moss from the swamp to the nearest road.

The Spanish match was a proposed marriage between Prince Charles, the son of King James I of Great Britain, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, the daughter of Philip III of Spain. Negotiations took place over the period 1614 to 1623, and during this time became closely related to aspects of British foreign and religious policy, before breaking down completely. The policy, unpopular with England's Protestant House of Commons, where the recent Anglo-Spanish War had not been forgotten, was initiated during the embassy to England of Gondomar, who arrived in London in 1614 with the offer that Spain would not interfere with James's troubled rule in Ireland if James would restrain the English \\"privateers\\" in Spanish American waters. Further, he proposed a marriage alliance, offering a dowry of ¬£500,000 (later increased to ¬£600,000), which seemed especially attractive to James after the failure of the Parliament of 1614 to provide him with the financial subsidies he requested. The climax of the ensuing decade of high- level negotiation to secure a marriage between the leading Protestant and Catholic royal families of Europe occurred in 1623 in Madrid, with the embassy of the Prince Charles and James's favourite, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. The wedding never took place despite the signing of a marriage contract by King James; criticism instead led to the dissolution of Parliament. Background Princess Elizabeth Stuart, later Queen of Bohemia, called the Winter Queen. The black armband is thought to be a sign of mourning for her brother Henry Frederick A Spanish marriage for Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, Charles's elder brother who had died in 1612, had been proposed by his mother Anne of Denmark. After his death she supported the idea of a Spanish marriage for her daughter Elizabeth, but in 1613 Elizabeth married a prominent Protestant prince. For her second son Charles, there were candidate marriages mooted from Savoie and Tuscany, as well as Spain and France. From 1614 to her own death in 1619, Queen Anne gave some support to a Spanish match, preferring at times a French marriage, and recognising that the Spanish proposals were entirely based on self-interest. A point brought up against it in 1620 was that the previous \\"Spanish matches\\", those that had brought Catherine of Aragon to England, and Philip II of Spain to marry Queen Mary, had in the popular memory turned out badly. James I's policy At the beginning of 1618 James I and VI was in a strong diplomatic position. His efforts against wars in Europe had been largely effective, and his own status as a Protestant ruler who was on good terms with Catholic powers was high. Success in reducing the religious factor in international relations then deteriorated for James, in parallel with the failure of the Spanish Match, with the onset of the Thirty Years' War. In 1618 he was still concerned with detailed moves to improve his relationship with Spain, such as the translation of the anti-Calvinist Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, and the execution of the buccaneering Sir Walter Raleigh. On the domestic front, the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between his heir Charles, Prince of Wales from 1616, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, was a potential source of income for James, who sought ways to rule without depending on the Commons for subsidies.Willson, p 357. The policy of the Spanish Match was supported by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats‚Äîtogether known as the \\"Spanish Party\\"‚Äîbut deeply distrusted by some Protestant groups in England. Sentiment was voiced vociferously in the Commons when James called his first parliament for seven years in 1621 to raise funds for a military expedition in support of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, his son-in-law. There was in fact no chance that Pope Paul V would have issued the required dispensation for the Infanta to marry a Protestant. This fact was known to the Spanish king, but apparently Gondomar was kept in ignorance of the correspondence. Paul V died early in 1621, and his successor Pope Gregory XV was thought amenable to the idea of the match. James sent George Gage to Rome to lobby, putting the case on behalf of English Catholics. The matter was passed to a small group of cardinals, who emphasised that improved treatment for English Catholics was a prerequisite. Political opposition By the 1620s, events on the continent had stirred up anti-Catholic feeling to a new pitch. A conflict had broken out between the Catholic Holy Roman Empire and the Protestant Palatinate, when the Bohemians deposed the Emperor as their king and elected James's son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, in his place, triggering the Thirty Years' War.Willson, pp 408‚Äì416. James reluctantly summoned parliament as the only means to raise the funds necessary to assist his daughter Elizabeth and Frederick, who had been ousted from Prague by Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620. The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick,Willson, p 417. and on the other called for a war directly against Spain.Willson, p 421. In November 1621, led by Sir Edward Coke, the Commons framed a petition asking not only for a war with Spain but for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws. When James heard of the petition, he is said to have cried, \\"God give me patience\\". James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment;Willson, p 442. to which provocation they reacted by issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech. James wrote: \\"We cannot with patience endure our subjects to use such anti-monarchical words to us concerning their liberties, except they had subjoined that they were granted unto them by the grace and favour of our predecessors.\\"Quoted by Willson, p 423. Urged on by Buckingham and the Spanish ambassador Gondomar, James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.Willson, p 243. Opposition literature, censorship and imprisonment Infanta Maria Anna, portrait Diego Vel√°zquez, 1630 Outside the political process, feelings that were both anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic ran high. Pamphleteering attacks aimed at the Spanish Match through the court, deploying \\"defamation, forgery and partisan distortion\\". Smears in the form of fabricated personal details about figures associated with the Spanish Party were published, especially by the Puritan faction. Thomas Scott is particularly noted for his part in this campaign, from 1619. In 1620, and again in 1621, James issued decrees against writing or speaking on state affairs. John Everard preached against the match in February 1621, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, and spent about half a year in the Gatehouse Prison. When Robert Mason wrote in 1622 to his friend Thomas Hobbes about public opinion on the match, criticising James's policy and noting Gondomar's skill in gaining support for it by holding out the prospect of the Palatine being returned to Frederick V, he hedged his comments with pleas for secrecy. Thomas Middleton's 1624 play A Game at Chess allegorized the events surrounding the Spanish Match. It was particularly harsh on Gondomar, represented by the Black Knight. Plays were in any case censored, and Henry Herbert as Master of the Revels passed it for performance; it was a short-lived succ√®s de scandale in August 1624. It has been suggested that Herbert connived at the unheard-of dramatic liberties taken in portraying members of the royal family, in a court now dominated by the anti-Spanish party. Plays of the previous two years that had Spanish settings, Middleton and Rowley's The Changeling and Thomas Dekker's Match Me in London, have been given readings that set them against the match, necessarily more covertly. Charles in Spain Prince Charles was entertained at the Alc√°zar of Segovia on his journey from Madrid to Santander Denied the military option, James ignored public opinion and returned to the Spanish match as his only hope of restoring the possessions of Elizabeth and Frederick. The position was altered, however, by the death of Philip III of Spain, in 1621. With the accession of Philip IV of Spain the Spanish proponent of the marriage, Gondomar, lost influence to Olivares. When negotiations began to drag, Prince Charles, now 22, and Buckingham decided to seize the initiative and travel to Spain incognito, to win the Infanta directly.Croft, p 118. Travelling under the names Thomas and John Smith, they arrived in Madrid on 7 March 1623 (OS) to the astonishment of Philip IV, and of the English Ambassador, John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol, who had been given no warning of the Prince's intentions. Charles and Buckingham were ignorant of the key facts, that Maria Anna was strongly averse to marrying a non-Catholic, and that the Spanish, who had been protracting the marriage negotiations to keep British troops out of the war, would never agree to such a match unless James and Charles pledged to repeal the anti-Catholic Penal Laws.Croft, pp 118‚Äì119. They were welcomed at court in Madrid. On their way to Santander they visited El Escorial, the Palace of Valsain, the Alc√°zar of Segovia, Valladolid, Palencia, and Fr√≥mista.John Nichols, Progresses of James the First, vol. 4 (London, 1828), pp. 913-19 quoting The Joyfull Returne of Charles, Prince of Great Brittaine (London, 1623), a translation of one of Almansa's works. The reception at court and the journey was described by the author Andr√©s de Almansa y Mendoza.Henry Ettinghausen, 'Greatest News Story', in Alexander Samson, The Spanish Match: Prince Charles's Journey to Madrid, 1623 (Ashgate, 2006), pp. 77-89. Though a secret treaty was signed, the Prince and Duke returned to England in October without the Infanta. There was open delight shown by sections of the British people.\\"There was an immense outbreak of popular joy, with fireworks, bell ringing and street parties.\\" Croft, p 120. The Privy Council From 1617 the negotiations for the match had been handled by the Privy Council. In fact it was considered that there was a need for confidential dealings with Spanish counterparts, and a subcommittee of the Council was set up for that reason; which later became a vehicle for discussion of foreign policy more generally, and persisted into the next reign. The last word on the Spanish Match was the vote in the Privy Council to reject the Spanish terms, taking place in January 1624. Aftermath Affronted by their treatment in Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James's Spanish policy on its head: they called for a French match and a war against the Habsburg Spanish empire.Croft, pp 120‚Äì121. To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1624. For once, the outpouring of anti-Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy had shifted from James to Charles and Buckingham,\\"The aging monarch was no match for the two men closest to him. By the end of the year, the prince and the royal favourite spoke openly against the Spanish marriage and pressured James to call a parliament to consider their now repugnant treaties...with hindsight...the prince‚Äôs return from Madrid marked the end of the king's reign. The prince and the favourite encouraged popular anti-Spanish sentiments to commandeer control of foreign and domestic policy.\\" Krugler, pp 63‚Äì4. who pressured the king to declare war and engineered the impeachment and imprisonment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, when he opposed the idea on grounds of cost.\\"The lord treasurer fell not on largely unproven grounds of corruption, but as the victim of an alliance between warmongering elements at court and in Parliament.\\" Croft, p 125. Lord Bristol, though entirely blameless, was made the scapegoat for the failure of the match: he was recalled in disgrace, ordered to remain on his estates and later imprisoned for a time in the Tower of London. Charles thus antagonised one of his most gifted and trustworthy public servants, and they were not fully reconciled until the outbreak of the English Civil War. The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare war, but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to financing a war against Spain, a stance which was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign.\\"On that divergence of interpretation, relations between the future king and the Parliaments of the years 1625‚Äì9 were to founder.\\" Croft, p 126. Charles eventually married Henrietta Maria of France.

Binary Research initially considered developing competitors to the file transfer programs Blast and Laplink. The product to compete with Blast was dropped at an early stage, but a program to transfer files over parallel or serial cables was developed and marketed from 1994 to 1996 under several names, including Beam, UniBeam and LinkWiz. This program was available in DOS, Windows 3.x, OS/2 2.0 and SCO Unix versions, and claimed to transfer files more rapidly than Laplink at that time. Later versions of the program could also transfer files using a network cable. Beam was not a financial success, as Laplink was the dominant product in that marketplace. Binary Research's next product, arising from the file transfer and parallel port technologies of Beam, was Ghost, first sold in 1996.InfoWorld magazine, 16 november 1998, page 112 Ghost pioneered the field of disk cloning software. A network of agents was set up around the world, and a branch of Binary Research Ltd, Binary Research International Inc, was established in Glendale, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin as a sales and support centre. Ghost was a very successful product, but Binary Research was a small company and was unable to drive the global sales force which Ghost needed. In 1998, Murray Haszard looked for a company which could acquire and develop Ghost further.

The object of the game is to collect complete families, and the game is similar to Go Fish. In Germany and Austria, the game is known as Quartett or Ablegspiel (in Upper Austria and Styria) and is not restricted to sets of four people, but covers other topics such as farm animals or tractors. The game can also be adapted for use with an ordinary set of playing cards. Gameplay A 'family' from a set of old German Quartett cards. Each card lists the three others that it groups with. The player whose turn it is asks another player for a specific card. If the asked player has the card, he gives it to the requester and the requester can then ask any player for another card. If the asked player does not have the card, it becomes his turn and he asks another player for a specific card. Play continues in this way until no families are separated among different players. The player with the most cards wins. One of the rules states that a player cannot ask for a certain card to deceive any player if he does not have a card in the set he is asking for.http://www.pagat.com/quartet/gofish.html#families Development  The game was devised by John Jaques Jr. who is also credited with popularizing tiddlywinks, ludo and snakes and ladders, and first published before the Great Exhibition of 1851.

It has a large readership among expatriates. It concentrates on the traditional values and customs of the English people, particularly those of rural and small-town England. History The magazine was started in 1968 by Roy Faiers of Lincolnshire, who held it as a private company (This England International Ltd.). Faiers remained editor-in-chief until 2009, when he sold the company to DC Thomson, owners of the Sunday Post, Beano, Dandy, The People's Friend, My Weekly and other publications. Faiers was succeeded as editor by his former deputy editor, Stephen Garnett, who in turn was succeeded by current editor, Angela Linforth. The name This England comes from the declamations of John of Gaunt in Act II, Scene I of Shakespeare's King Richard II: \\"This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle... This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.\\" Content The magazine started with the slogan \\"As refreshing as a cup of tea!\\" Later issues described themselves as \\"For all those who love this green and pleasant land\\", and \\"Britain's loveliest magazine since 1968\\". This England has always editorially described itself as a publication with an emphasis on Christian conservative values. It has sometimes been known, however, as a voice of political activism. For most of its years the magazine featured a strong pro-British, Eurosceptic editorial outlook. It showcased articles against the European Union and related topics like metrication. Jeremy Paxman remarked that the magazine's greatest enemy was \\"the march of time\\", claiming that \\"not one article in the magazine looks forward to the future\\".The English: a Portrait of a People, Jeremy Paxman, Overlook Press, 2000, page 79 The magazine's main content remains focused on English cultural history and lore.

The series tells the story of a newspaper's investigation into the death of a political researcher, and centres on the relationship between the leading journalist, Cal McCaffrey, and his old friend, Stephen Collins, who is a Member of Parliament and the murdered woman's employer. The series is primarily set in London and was produced in-house by the BBC in association with the independent production company Endor Productions. The series stars David Morrissey, John Simm, Kelly Macdonald, Polly Walker, Bill Nighy, and James McAvoy in the main roles. The series was Abbott's first attempt to write a political thriller, and he initially made the majority of the plot up as he went along. He was prompted to write the series after BBC Head of Drama Jane Tranter asked him whether he would consider writing a piece \\"bigger\\" than anything he had written so far in his career. The serial was Abbott's third major writing project for the channel, following Clocking Off and Linda Green. The series was also a major turning point in David Yates' directorial career, as he began to direct various high-profile television projects following his work on the series. The six-part series was broadcast on BBC One on Sunday evenings at 9:00pm from 18 May to 22 June 2003. Episodes two to five were initially premiered on the digital television station BBC Four at 10:00pm on the nights of the preceding episodes' BBC One broadcast; however episode six was held back for a premiere on BBC One, so as not to allow the final twists to be spoiled for those who did not have access to digital television. In 2004, the series ran in the United States on the BBC's BBC America cable channel. In 2005, the series was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide, in a two- disc set. Episode one features an audio commentary from Abbott and Yates, and episode six a commentary from Yates, producer Hilary Bevan-Jones and editor Mark Day. The success of the series and its favourable impression on BBC executives led to Abbott being commissioned to write a sequel, before the first series had even been aired.McLean, Gareth.

The story is gripping, the acting is ace and Paul Abbott's script is outstanding. His ear for dialogue, and for different voices, is exceptional. The exposition is swift, nifty and joyously unclunky. The characters are credible and rounded. If you can count the best dramas of recent years on the fingers of both hands, it's time to grow a new finger.\\" Other newspaper critics were similarly impressed with the opening instalment.

The consensus appeared to be that the serial did maintain its quality to the end. Previewing episode four, Jonathan Wright of The Guide section in The Guardian described it as \\"A political conspiracy thriller that's as buttock-clenchingly tense as Edge of Darkness, as cynical about the British political system as House of Cards, and stands comparisons to both.\\"Wright, Jonathan. Watch This: State of Play, 9pm, BBC1. \\"The Guardian\\" (\\"The Guide\\" section). Saturday 7 June 2003. The television critic of The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe, wrote of the final episode: \\"I'm not sure that a thriller can end in anything other than anti- climax. If it has been good you're sad it's over, and if it ends badly you're quite likely to feel that you've been duped.

They are distinctive black and white birds with a long tail that is held upright as they forage on the ground or perch conspicuously. Occurring across most of the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia, they are common birds in urban gardens as well as forests. They are particularly well known for their songs and were once popular as cagebirds. The oriental magpie-robin is considered as the national bird of Bangladesh. Description Female of the nominate race (India) This species is long, including the long tail, which is usually held cocked upright when hopping on the ground. When they are singing a song the tail is normal like other birds. It is similar in shape to the smaller European robin, but is longer-tailed. The male has black upperparts, head and throat apart from a white shoulder patch. The underparts and the sides of the long tail are white. Females are greyish black above and greyish white. Young birds have scaly brown upperparts and head. The nominate race is found on the Indian subcontinent and the females of this race are the palest. The females of the Andaman Islands race andamanensis are darker, heavier-billed and shorter-tailed. The Sri Lankan race ceylonensis (formerly included with the peninsular Indian populations south of the Kaveri River) and southern nominate individuals have the females nearly identical to the males in shade. The eastern populations, the ones in Bangladesh and Bhutan, have more black on the tail and were formerly named erimelas. The populations in Myanmar (Burma) and further south are named as the race musicus. A number of other races have been named across the range, including prosthopellus (Hong Kong), nesiotes, zacnecus, nesiarchus, masculus, pagiensis, javensis, problematicus, amoenus, adamsi, pluto, deuteronymus and mindanensis. However, many of these are not well-marked and the status of some of them is disputed. Some, like mindanensis, have now been usually recognized as full species (the Philippine magpie-robin). There is more geographic variation in the plumage of females than in that of the males. It is mostly seen close to the ground, hopping along branches or foraging in leaf-litter on the ground with a cocked tail. Males sing loudly from the top of trees or other high perches during the breeding season. Etymology Illustration from John Ray's Synopsis methodicam avium & piscium (1713) The Indian name of dhyal or dhayal has led to many confusions. It was first used by Eleazar Albin (\\"dialbird\\") in 1737 (Suppl. N. H. Birds, i. p. 17, pls. xvii. xviii.), and Levaillant (Ois. d'Afr. iii. p. 50) thought it referred to a sun dial and he called it Cadran. Thomas C. Jerdon wrote (B. India, ii. p. 1l6) that Linnaeus, thinking it had some connection with a sun-dial, called it solaris, by lapsus pennae, saularis. This was however identified by Edward Blyth as an incorrect interpretation and that it was a Latinization of the Hindi word saulary which means a \\"hundred songs\\". A male bird was sent with this Hindi name from Madras by surgeon Edward Buckley to James Petiver, who first described the species (Ray, Synops. Meth. Avium, p. 197). Distribution and habitat This magpie-robin is a resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and eastern Pakistan, eastern Indonesia, Thailand, south China, Malaysia, and Singapore. They have been introduced to Australia. The Oriental magpie-robin is found in open woodland and cultivated areas often close to human habitations. Behaviour and ecology Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden Magpie-robins breed mainly from March to July in India and January to June in south-east Asia. Males sing from high perches during courtship. The display of the male involves puffing up the feathers, raising the bill, fanning the tail and strutting. They nest in tree hollows or niches in walls or building, often adopting nest boxes. They line the cavity with grass. The female is involved in most of the nest building, which happens about a week before the eggs are laid. Four or five eggs are laid at intervals of 24 hours and these are oval and usually pale blue green with brownish speckles that match the color of hay. The eggs are incubated by the female alone for 8 to 14 days. The nests are said to have a characteristic odour. Juvenile with scaly markings (Sri Lanka) Females spend more effort on feeding the young than males. Males are quite aggressive in the breeding season and will defend their territory. and respond to the singing of intruders and even their reflections. Males spend more time on nest defense. Studies of the bird song show dialects with neighbours varying in their songs. The calls of many other species may be imitated as part of their song. This may indicate that birds disperse and are not philopatric. Females may sing briefly in the presence of a male. Apart from their song, they use a range of calls including territorial calls, emergence and roosting calls, threat calls, submissive calls, begging calls and distress calls. The typical mobbing calls is a harsh hissing krshhh. The diet of magpie-robins includes mainly insects and other invertebrates. Although mainly insectivorous, they are known to occasionally take flower nectar, geckos, leeches, centipedes and even fish. They are often active late at dusk. They sometimes bathe in rainwater collected on the leaves of a tree. Status This species is considered as one of \\"least concern\\" globally, but in some areas it is declining. In Singapore and Hong Kong (Malay names Murai Kampung/cacing) they were common in the 1920s, but declined in the 1970s, presumably due to competition from introduced common mynas. Poaching for the pet bird trade and habitat changes have also affected them and they are locally protected by law. This species has few avian predators. Several pathogens and parasites have been reported. Avian malaria parasites have been isolated from the species while H4N3 and H5N1 infection has been noted in a few cases. Parasitic nematodes of the eye have been described In culture Doel Chattar, Dhakaright Oriental magpie-robins were widely kept as cage birds for their singing abilities and for fighting in India in the past. They continue to be sold in the pet trade in parts of Southeast Asia. Aside from being recognized as the national bird of the country, in Bangladesh, the oriental magpie-robin is common and known as the doyel or doel (). It is a widely used symbol in Bangladesh, appearing on currency notes, and a landmark in the city of Dhaka is named as the Doel Chattar (meaning: Doel Square). In Sri Lanka, this bird is called Polkichcha. References Other sources * Mehrotra, P. N. 1982. Morphophysiology of the cloacal protuberance in the male Copsychus saularis (L.) (Aves, Passeriformes).

Location of Kittanning Gap after GNIS finding of 'Kittanning Gap, Pennsylvania' seen in USGS National Map viewer screenshot. The gap is located effectively in a western suburb of Altoona, PA. The Kittanning Path was a major east-west Native American trail that crossed the Allegheny Mountains barrier ridge connecting the Susquehanna River valleys in the center of Pennsylvania to the highlands of the Appalachian Plateau and thence to the western lands beyond drained by the Ohio River. Kittanning Village was the first major Delaware (Lenape) Indian settlement along the descent from the Allegheny Plateau. Nature and the path The path is made up of a \\"series of path alternatives\\" that pass through seasonally or directionally more or less difficult notches-- the gaps were among only five places that could be crossed by animal power from east to west across the Appalachian Mountains west of New England. The Kittanny path (by other names) would also come to be used first by Dutch, then English and British colonial fur traders, as well as Amerindian emigrants moving westwards before and after the French and Indian War and in the post-1780 settlers migrations west of the Mountain as the American Revolution entered its final years. For centuries the Kittanning Path, like the similar Chief Nemacolin's Trail to the south, was the overland route through very tough country for Native American peoples. They included Iroquoian-speaking tribes, such as the Erie, Susquehannock, and the Five Nations of the Iroquois confederacy, as well as the Algonquian- speaking Lenape, Miami, and Siouan Shawnee. Early European explorers and settlers also learned to use the Indian paths to cross the Allegheny Mountains barrier ridge. The path made use of one of the few so-called gaps of the Allegheny that accompanied the feedwater streams draining into the Juniata River, a tributary of the Susquehanna that terminated on the Allegheny River due Northeast of Pittsburgh in what is now Armstrong County, Pennsylvania at the Native American Kittanning Village (at present-day Kittanning, Pennsylvania). By the time of the French and Indian War, starting in 1754, Kittanning Village was believed by Europeans to be the largest Native American village in the Ohio Country west of the Alleghenies. It was located in an area of Pennsylvania that had been closed to white settlement by the original treaty of William Penn with the Lenape. In an attempt to settle frontier borders and reduce conflict among Indian tribes, the English and Native Americans signed the Treaty of Fort Stanwix after the French and Indian War. It opened some of Pennsylvania west of the Alleghenies to white settlement. In the 1750s, this area had been the scene of a fierce raids by Native Americans against white settlement, and a major British retribution campaign. A section of the original path is preserved in northwestern Cambria County.  Description (East to West)  It began southeast of Altoona at Frankstown on the Juniata River. It ran west, crossing the Allegheny Ridge approximately 5 mi (8 km) west of Altoona at Kittanning Gap, later the location of the Horseshoe Curve railroad site. The path ran northwest through Cambria County, passing east of Carrolltown. It entered Indiana County approximately 1 mi (1.6 km) south of Cherry Tree at \\"Canoe Place\\", the uppermost Native American canoe portage on the West Branch of the Susquehanna. It followed a southwest course, through Yellow Creek State Park, then along the headwaters of Two Lick Creek, roughly past Uniontown, Pennsylvania (not the current Uniontown), Cookport, and Diamondville to U.S. Highway 422. It followed the approximate present course of the highway west and NNW through Indiana to Shelocta. It crossed into Armstrong County near Elderton and ended at the village of Kittanning on the east bank of the Allegheny.  History  The path was in use as early as 1721. In 1744 the English trader John Hart was granted a license by colonial authorities to trade with the Indians in western Pennsylvania lands, which were then closed to white settlement. Hart established a way station campsite, called Hart's Sleeping Place, near the continental divide in Cambria County. The way station appeared on colonial maps and was used in 1752 by Gov. James Hamilton, and in 1754 by John Harris, the founder of Harrisburg. The last Native American encampment was recorded at the site in 1781. In the 1750s the path became the raiding route taken by Lenape. Unhappy with a treaty that took away much of their land rights in western Pennsylvania, they raided white settlements in central Pennsylvania. In 1755, the Lenape chief Shingas used the trail to attack British settlements along the Juniata River, returning with captives to the village of Kittanning. In early August 1756, the Lenape used the path for a raid to burn Fort Granville near present-day Lewistown, when they also took prisoners. After the fort was burned, the British dispatched Lt. Colonel John Armstrong for retaliation. He pursued the Lenape along the path and camped at Canoe Place in early September; he continued to the village of Kittanning, which he destroyed. Armstrong earned the accolade among British colonials as \\"the Hero of Kittanning\\" for the raid. He later served as a Major General for the United States in the American Revolutionary War and was elected to the Second Continental Congress. The path was also traveled by early German pioneer Conrad Weiser, who was accompanied by William Franklin, the son of Benjamin Franklin. Weiser recorded the journey in his journal. The Kittanning Path is not to be confused with the Kittanning Road, which was built by American rebel forces in 1779 during the Sullivan Expedition. The Kittanning Road followed a more northerly course, running from Kittanning to the site of what is now Olean, New York.

In 1993, leader Wong Ka Kui, died at the age of 31 after an accident during the filming of a show at Fuji Television in Tokyo. Beyond continued to perform and record after Wong Ka Kui's death. In 2005, the remaining members Paul Wong, Wong Ka Keung and Yip Sai Wing decided to pursue their own solo careers, and Beyond officially disbanded.  History   Early years  In the early 1980s, lead vocalist Wong Ka Kui and drummer Yip Sai Wing started out as young musicians and both had interests in Pink Floyd's progressive rock.Big5.china.com.cn. \\"Big5.china.com.cn .\\" Beyond. Retrieved on 27 December 2010. In 1983, they decided to join a music contest for \\"Guitar magazine\\" and they decided to form a band with lead guitarist William Tang (ÈÑßÁÖíË¨ô) and bassist Lee Wing Chiu (ÊùéÊ¶ÆÊΩÆ). Tang wished the band's name to convey a feeling of surpassing or going beyond themselves, so the name \\"Beyond\\" was chosen. However, the band name was not definite at the time. The band's musical style was still experimental. Wong Ka Kui and Tai Chi lead guitarist Joey Tang formed a temporary band called NASA band that did art rock style of music with English pop. In 1984, Wong's younger brother Wong Ka Keung joined the band as bassist. At the time, the band consisted of Wong Ka Kui, Yip Sai Wing, Wong Ka Keung and new lead guitarist Chan Sze On (Èô≥ÊôÇÂÆâ). Chan soon had to leave for a foreign country, leaving the band without lead guitarist. In 1985 Paul Wong joined the band to replace him. In the early years, time was difficult for the band. They had to do everything themselves, including organising its finance, selling tickets, performing and buying their own equipment. They rented out Caritas Hong Kong for a mini concert called \\"Forever waiting concert\\" and invited people. Not a single record company showed up, and the audience was indifferent to the band. Someone stepped in as their manager to help them raise HK$16,000, but the band was soon left with only HK$1000. In 1986, the band rented a studio to record the album Goodbye Ideal (ÂÜçË¶ãÁêÜÊÉ≥). Lau Chi Yuen (ÂäâÂøóÈÅ†) then joined Beyond as lead guitarist and keyboardist. At the time Small island, Tat Ming Pair and Beyond made a recording together. Small island was scheduled to go to a July 1986 Pan-Asian Music Festival in Taipei, and Beyond was added to the schedule. Beyond was well liked and they joined another festival that same year. They would then sign with Kinn's Music record company.  Commercial success  In 1987, Beyond produced the second album. The album Arabian Dancing Girls (ÈòøÊãâ‰ºØË∑≥ËàûÂ•≥ÈÉé) was one of the band's first commercial hits. They soon were in a new music underground trend along with a few number of bands, such as Tai Chi, Cocos and Raidas. Lau Chi Yuen left the band in 1988, leaving the band with four members only. In 1989, Beyond became the first Hong Kong band to perform in Beijing at the Capital Indoor Stadium. Since Beyond's songs were in Cantonese (instead of Mandarin), the performance was not well received by the audience. Before the stadium was filled, half the people had already left. However, they still considered the concert a success. After a couple of flops, Beyond started to gain popularity following the release of the hit song \\"Great Land\\" (Â§ßÂú∞). They would soon win their first musical awards, the 1988 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation and 1989 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. In 1990, they released one of their signature songs, \\"Glorious Years\\" (ÂÖâËºùÊ≠≤Êúà). The song was about racism and the struggle of Nelson Mandela in South Africa.Arts.cultural-china.com. \\"Arts.cultural-china.com .\\" Arts. Retrieved on 22 December 2010. The song was a huge hit, and had a fresh sound that stood out from the sea of love songs that dominated the Cantopop scene in Hong Kong. The song was from the band's album Party of Fate (ÂëΩÈÅãÊ¥æÂ∞ç), which sold extremely well, achieving triple platinum. In 1991, Beyond released another critically acclaimed song \\"Amani\\" from the album Hesitation (Áå∂Ë±´). The song was written during Beyond's trip to Tanzania.http://www.greenpeace.org. \\"www.greenpeace.org.\\" ÈõçÂÆπ ÊîøÂ∫úËàáÂÖ¨ÂÖ±‰∫ãÂãô‰∏ª‰ªª. Retrieved on 27 December 2010. As suggested by the title, which means \\"peace\\" in Swahili, the song is about the plight of war-ravaged Africa and the yearning for world peace. Part of the song's lyrics were written in Swahili. The song is still often used by Hong Kong's human rights bands to spread the message of peace. In the same year, Beyond made their first appearance on Japan's NHK station. They immediately signed with record company Amuse. Beyond started to become a more international band, and began to focus more time in Japan and Taiwan. The album Continue the Revolution (ÁπºÁ∫åÈù©ÂëΩ) achieved commercial and critical success. In May 1993, Beyond released the album Rock and Roll (Ê®ÇËàáÊÄí) which included the song \\"Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies\\" (Êµ∑ÈóäÂ§©Á©∫). That song would become Wong Ka Kui's last song with the band.

The death occurred at the prime of the band's career, with the tremendous success of the song \\"Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies\\" released around the time. His funeral procession caused traffic in various major streets in Hong Kong to come to a standstill, and many top Hong Kong Cantopop singers of the time attended and paid tribute at the funeral. Criticisms followed that the Japanese were having too many late night shows of this type, and the TV station crews were overworked.

The members of the Papilionoidea may be distinguished by the following combination of characters: *The body is smaller and less moth-like. *The wings are larger. *The antennae are straight and clubbed or hooked as in the skippers. *The caterpillars do not spin cocoons in which to pupate. *The pupae are angular rather than rounded. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest the traditionally circumscribed Papilionoidea are a paraphyletic group, and that skippers (family Hesperiidae) and Neotropical moth-like butterflies (family Hedylidae) are true butterflies that should be included within the Papilionoidea superfamily to reflect cladistic relationships. Families of Papilionoidea The six well-supported families of Papilionoidea are: * Hesperiidae (skippers) *Swallowtails and birdwings, Papilionidae *Whites or yellow-whites, Pieridae *Blues and coppers or gossamer-winged butterflies, Lycaenidae *Metalmark butterflies, Riodinidae *Brush-footed butterflies, Nymphalidae which contain the following 13 subfamilies: ** The snout butterflies or Libytheinae (formerly the family Libytheidae) ** The danaids or Danainae (formerly the family Danaidae) ** The Tellervinae ** The glasswings or Ithomiinae ** The Calinaginae ** The morphos and owls or Morphinae (including the owls as tribe Brassolini) ** The browns or Satyrinae (formerly the family Satyridae) ** The Charaxinae (preponas and leaf butterflies) ** The Biblidinae ** The Apaturinae ** The nymphs or Nymphalinae ** The Limenitidinae (especially the adelphas) ** The tropical longwings or Heliconiinae Of the subfamilies of Nymphalidae, only the Morphinae and Satyrinae are possibly paraphyletic, but these two subfamilies form a strongly supported clade with the Charaxinae as sister group.Gerardo Lamas (2008) Systematics of butterflies (Lepidoptera: Hesperioidea and Papilionoidea) in the world: current state and future perspectives (in Spanish).

The fossil genus Lithopsyche is apparently a Papilionoidea incertae sedis, which has long been mistaken for a geometer moth of the Boarmiini. It is variously placed in the Lycaenidae or Riodinidae. A similar fossil, Lithodryas, is more firmly assigned to the Lycaenidae, but might belong to the Nymphalidae. Riodinella, yet another prehistoric genus, also seems to belong here, but its relationships are quite obscure, indeed. However, these fossils - all found in Eocene deposits dating roughly between 50 and 25 million years ago - suggest the radiation of the Papilionoidea into the present-day families took place during that epoch. Prodryas, from the end of the Eocene, can be quite robustly assigned to the Nymphalidae, and is quite likely a member of the Nymphalini. Oligocene fossils of Papilionoidea are usually assignable to an extant family without problems. Taken together, these fossils place the origin of the Papilionoidea in the latest Mesozoic or early Paleogene, while the extant families emerged around the early Eocene onwards.

Reforging the Great Chain of Being: Studies of the History of Modal Theories, Springer Science & Business Media, 2013 p.3 Biography Lovejoy was born in Berlin, Germany while his father was doing medical research there. Eighteen months later, his mother committed suicide, whereupon his father gave up medicine and became a clergyman. Lovejoy studied philosophy, first at the University of California at Berkeley, then at Harvard under William James and Josiah Royce. In 1901, he resigned from his first job, at Stanford University, to protest the dismissal of a colleague who had offended a trustee. The President of Harvard then vetoed hiring Lovejoy on the grounds that he was a known troublemaker. Over the subsequent decade, he taught at Washington University, Columbia University, and the University of Missouri. He never married. As a professor of philosophy at Johns Hopkins University from 1910 to 1938, Lovejoy founded and long presided over that university's History of Ideas Club, where many prominent and budding intellectual and social historians, as well as literary critics, gathered. In 1940 he co-founded the Journal of the History of Ideas with Philip P. Wiener.Sidney Axinn, \\"Wiener, Philip Paul (1905-92)\\", in: John R. Shook, ed., Dictionary Of Modern American Philosophers, Bristol: Thoemmes, 2005. Retrieved 17 July 2005. Lovejoy insisted that the history of ideas should focus on \\"unit ideas,\\" single concepts (namely simple concepts sharing an abstract name with other concepts that were to be conceptually distinguished). Abstract nouns like 'pragmatism' 'idealism', 'rationalism' and the like were, in Lovejoy's view, constituted by distinct, analytically separate ideas, which the historian of the genealogy of ideas had to thresh out, and show how the basic unit ideas combine and recombine with each other over time.Arthur O. Lovejoy, [The Great Chain of Being,] (1936) Harper & Row 1960 pp.5ff. The idea has, according to Simo Knuuttila, exercised a greater attraction on literary critics than on philosophers. Lovejoy was active in the public arena. He helped found the American Association of University Professors and the Maryland chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. However, he qualified his belief in civil liberties to exclude what he considered threats to a free system. Thus, at the height of the McCarthy Era (in the February 14, 1952 edition of the Journal of Philosophy) Lovejoy stated that, since it was a \\"matter of empirical fact\\" that membership in the Communist Party contributed \\"to the triumph of a world-wide organization\\" which was opposed to \\"freedom of inquiry, of opinion and of teaching,\\" membership in the party constituted grounds for dismissal from academic positions. He also published numerous opinion pieces in the Baltimore press. He died in Baltimore on December 30, 1962. Scholarship In the domain of epistemology, Lovejoy is remembered for an influential critique of the pragmatic movement, especially in the essay \\"The Thirteen Pragmatisms\\", written in 1908.\\"The Thirteen Pragmatisms, The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods, nowThe Journal of Philosophy, Part I, 2 January 1908 p. 5-12. Part II, 16 January 1908, p. 29-39 William F. Bynum, looking back at Lovejoy's Great Chain of Being after 40 years, describes it as \\"a familiar feature of the intellectual landscape\\", indicating its great influence and \\"brisk\\" ongoing sales. Bynum argues that much more research is needed into how the concept of the great chain of being was replaced, but he agrees that Lovejoy was right that the crucial period was the end of the 18th century when \\"the Enlightenment's chain of being was dismantled\\".William F.

Set in the 2100s in the science fiction Star Trek universe, Phlox is a major character aboard the first Warp 5 starship commanded by Captain Archer, and makes his debut in the premier episode, \\"Broken Bow,\\" in 2001. Phlox marked the introduction of the Denobulan aliens, which were a new alien species to the franchise. Dr. Phlox is the chief medical officer aboard the starship Enterprise (NX-01). Overview Phlox is a Denobulan, and was on Earth as part of the Interspecies Medical Exchange when called to serve aboard the Enterprise. As part of the Exchange, he corresponds regularly with his human counterpart on Denobula Triaxa, Dr. Lucas (After the Xindi attack on Earth, Lucas was recalled from Denobula and transferred to the Earth Cryogenic Storage Facility known as Cold Station 12). In accordance with Denobulan custom, Phlox has three wives, each of whom has two other husbands. Only one of his wives, Feezal, was seen on the show. Phlox has five children by his wives: two daughters, both of whom, like him, work in the medical field, and three sons. One is an artist but his youngest son Metus is estranged from him. Phlox sent a message attempting to reconcile at the end of episode 21, season 2. The doctor is portrayed as having an open mind to other species and cultures, even the Antarans, a race that once warred with the Denobulans. He is extremely frank about romantic and sexual matters, often to the embarrassment of other crew members, and sometimes plays the role of matchmaker. He has an interest in natural remedies, and his sickbay contains an interplanetary zoo of animals, some of them as food for other animals which are used as source for medical drugs. Phlox is curious with a wry sense of humor, and has an affinity for Earth cuisine, particularly Chinese food (especially egg drop soup). He is also interested in religion: he once prayed with a group of monks who visited Enterprise, spent a week with monks at a Tibetan monastery, attended Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, and observed the Tal-Shanar ritual at the Vulcan compound in Sausalito. Phlox's physical abilities have been revealed gradually over time. He appears to need little sleep, instead embarking on an annual \\"hibernation\\" of sorts that lasts for six days. Phlox also has great control over his facial muscles, being able to open his mouth wider than humans, as demonstrated by the impossibly large grin he occasionally sports (\\"Broken Bow\\", \\"A Night in Sickbay\\", \\"These Are the Voyages...\\"). When threatened, Phlox has the ability to inflate his head like a blowfish to scare off attackers (\\"Home\\"). Phlox was injected with Borg nanoprobes in the episode \\"Regeneration\\" by an assimilated Tarkalean male. The Tarkalean had been on board a freighter attacked by reanimated drones from the sphere shot down over the Arctic by the Enterprise-E after having traveled back through time just before humanity first used warp drive and made First Contact with Vulcans (approximately 90 years before Enterprise is set (see Star Trek: First Contact)). Due to his strong immune system, his assimilation proceeded slowly, giving him time to counteract the process by killing the nanoprobes with high levels of omicron radiation. The method would be lethal to humans or other non-Denobulan races. Mirror Universe In the Mirror Universe, Phlox is not the engaging, peaceful, and friendly character he is in the normal universe. The Mirror Phlox dresses in a severe black leather uniform, unlike the civilian clothing worn by his counterpart. He resembles Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in his utter lack of morals, in that he routinely experiments on living alien beings in a horrible fashion in his sick bay, which resembles a chamber of horrors. When the ISS Enterprise is destroyed by the Tholians, Phlox and other survivors transfer to the USS Defiant, which has been commandeered by Commander Jonathan Archer. Eventually, Phlox is convinced by the Mirror T'Pol and Soval to join a rebellion against the Terran Empire, and attempts to sabotage the ship, but is stopped by the Mirror Charles Tucker III. Phlox was able to nearly complete his sabotage, as the Terrans trusted Denobulans more so than their other alien subordinates. According to Mirror Archer, they were not prone to rebellion or defiance.  Reception  In 2015, Den of Geek in a review of important show characters, noted him as \\"funny, quirky Phlox\\" and pointing out the character introduced audience to the Denobulan species. They recommended the episodes \\"Dear Doctor\\", ‚ÄúStigma‚Äù, \\"The Breach‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äôs Orders‚Äù for the Phlox character. In 2016, SyFy ranked Phlox 1st of the 6 main-cast space doctor's of the Star Trek Franchise. They elaborate that Phlox has very good bed-side manner, a relaxing demeanor, and has noted success in curing patients including getting partially Borged. In 2018, The Wrap placed Phlox as 27th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the Star Trek franchise prior to Star Trek: Discovery.

It favors certain elements of Maoism, including the significant role of state planning, the preservation of state-owned enterprises, and a renewed collectivism. The ambiguity of the term New Left in China arises from its breadth. Generally speaking, New Left can be applied to a person who embraces leftist theories, ideals and traditions ranging from Marxism to socialism, postmodernism and other schools criticizing neoliberalism. The New Left's relationship with Maoism and capitalism is complicated. Although some schools of thought suggest that the New Left wants the return to mass political movements of the Mao Zedong era and an abandonment of capitalism, others believe that it combines capitalism's open markets with socialist elements (particularly in rural China).Cui, Zhiyuan. \\"How to Comprehend Today's China.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought. 37.4 (2006). Print. New Left supporters such as Cui Zhiyuan and Wang Hui are skeptical about neoliberalism and democratic capitalism. Terminology Although many New Left intellectuals oppose certain Maoist approaches, the term \\"New Left\\" implies some agreement with Maoism. Since it is associated with the ultra-leftism of the Cultural Revolution, many scholars and intellectuals supporting socialist approaches and reforms but opposing the radical, brutal approaches of the Maoist period do not completely accept the \\"New Left\\" label. Some are concerned about the fact that adopting leftism implies that China, historically different from the West, is still using a Western model to strategise its reforms and would be limited by how the West defines the Left. Wang Hui explains the origin of, and his skepticism about, the term: Origin The concept of the New Left arose in China during the late 1990s. After the failure of liberal movements in the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping's 1992 trip to Shenzhen and the 14th Party Congress in 1992, scholars and media figures began to adopt a more critical stand towards marketization and its consequences‚Äîincluding (but not limited to) social and economic inequalities between the coast and the hinterlands, urban and rural areas, and rich and poor people. According to New Left theory, market-economy challenges stem from the fact that under Chinese economic reform, the market economy has become the dominant economic system; China's socialist economic reforms have brought the country into the global capitalist sphere. The development of the New Left is correlated to increased Chinese nationalism after its period of low-profile presence on the world stage during the Deng Xiaoping era. It is seen as a response to problems faced by China during its modernization drive since the 1980s, which has led to growing social inequality between coast and hinterlands and rich and poor. Some scholars believe that, based on its unique and drastic 20th-century economic and political changes, China cannot adopt the social-democratic, capitalist model of many Western countries. Some critics say that the early-20th-century New Culture Movement's embrace of enlightenment went too far in identifying the West with modernization, and China needs to find its own path to modernity. The Chinese New Left is concerned with the country's social-inequality issues. Some scholars believe that although the movement is not yet mature, it is likely to embed itself in Chinese society over the next century (assuming that polarization continues). Strikes, sit-ins, slow-downs and peasant uprisings, sporadic due to government suppression, are on the rise and may become more organized with the development of the New Left. Although they are skeptical and critical of capitalism, New Leftists recognize its influence on China and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of capitalist models. Cui Zhiyuan, a leading New Left intellectual, believes that it is imperative that socialism and capitalism are not viewed as opposites.Mishra, Panka. \\"China's New Leftist.\\" New York Times [New York] 15 010 2006, Magazine n. pag. Web. 9 May. 2012. . According to Zhang Xudong, \\"An advocate for New Deal-style economic and social policies in China was considered to be liberal in the 1980s, but as 'New Left' by the century's end.\\" This overlap suggests that ideals set forth by the New Left strongly resemble the democratic socialism and \\"humanistic Marxism\\" of the 1980s.Zhang, Xudong, \\"The Making of the Post-Tiananmen Intellectual Field: A Critical Overview.\\" In Whither China? Intellectual Politics in Contemporary Chin, ed. Xudong Zhang (1-75). Durham: Duke University Press, 2001, p.16.Gan, Yang \\"Zhongguo ziyouzuopai de youlai\\" (Origins of the Chinese Liberal Left). In Sichao: Zhongguo 'xinzuopai' jiqi yingxiang (Ideological Trends: The Chinese \\"New Left\\" and its Influence), ed. Gong Yang (110-120). Beijing: Zhongguo shehui kexue chubanshe, 2003. Beijing Consensus The phrase \\"Beijing Consensus\\" was coined by Joshua Cooper Ramo to frame China's economic development model as an alternative, especially for developing countries, to the Washington Consensus of market-friendly policies promoted by the IMF, the World Bank, and the U.S. Treasury. Although the debate at the time revolved around management buyouts (MBOs) and the protection of private property, it actually considered the issues of privatization and socialism. Discussion became so heated that Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao went out of their way to reiterate their support for reform at the 2006 National People's Congress. Debates about MBOs and property rights were extensions of the strongly- ideological debate over socialism versus capitalism that emerged after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, only quieting in the wake of Deng Xiaoping's 1992 trip to Shenzhen and the subsequent 14th Party Congress that year. Deng's call for economic reform unleashed market forces and a series of often- wasteful, duplicative investment. In the wake of this upsurge of market activity, the New Left (a loose-knit group of young intellectuals) emerged and began developing a new critique of China's economic and social path. Views Economics Economics plays a significant role in the Chinese New Left, whose development is closely associated with Chinese economic reform. Many supporters of the New Left generally believe that a leftist economic model should be found to tackle China's dependence on exports and savings, reduce the growing economic gap between rural and urban areas and stimulate private business through public ownership and state planning. The capitalist free- market model applied in most social-democratic programs is undesirable because instead of challenging and reforming the existing market economy and representative democracy, it seeks to moderate the social consequences of structural division and hierarchy. A suitable, sustainable market model is vital for China's leftist movement. New Left economist Cui Zhiyuan believes that a labour-capital partnership, based on the ideas of James Meade and John Maynard Keynes, can be used to introduce some flexibility to the labour market. Outside shareholders own capital-share certificates; workers own labour and share certificates, which replace a fixed wage and reduce the conflict of interest between workers and capitalists. Any decision that will improve one group (by raising the dividend on its share) will automatically raise the dividend on the shares of the other group. Many New Left intellectuals are confident in the outcome of collective economic-development planning, anticipating rural industrialization. Human rights Some Chinese New Leftists prioritize universal human rights. According to Hu Ping, the most important human right is freedom of speech. During the Great Leap Forward, grain production decreased and it became evident that many people were beginning to starve. However (as reported by newspapers), the following harvest would be ample. Hu wrote: Other members of the Chinese New Left, particularly since the Great Recession, have rejected the centrality of human rights and universal values in general. These theorists have argued for the construction of an authoritarian Chinese political government separate from Western intellectual traditions. Traditional Chinese culture The New Left movement has shown some convergence with the Confucian revival movement in China, who advocate restoration of ancient Chinese cultural traditions such as filial piety and especially the civil service examinations. Both ideologies emerged in the late 1990s as a nationalist reaction to the dominance of neoliberalism in China. Leftists and Confucians are increasingly demonstrating a degree of reciprocity. Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared that\\"to solve China‚Äôs problems‚Ä¶ [China needs] to fully make use of the great wisdom accumulated by the Chinese nation over the last 5,000 years.‚Äù Academics such as Sun Yat-sen University's Gan Yang have identified as both leftist and Confucian, and a 2015 paper by Harvard and MIT researchers have found that Chinese netizens tend to congregate into two camps, one side an internationalist, democratic, free market faction, and another a pro- traditional culture, nationalistic, socialist faction. Each camp showed a high level of ideological unity. Radicalism A subgroup of New Leftists are more radical, adhering to Marxism as originally interpreted by Mao and implemented during the first twenty years or so of the People's Republic of China's existence. They believe that China has long been moving away from the communist path, resulting in the rise of capitalists who will exploit peasants and workers as they did before 1949. Similar to the worldwide Maoist movement, this strain of New Leftists opposes the Chinese government's policy of openness and economic reform; they do not consider Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward wrong-headed in an ideological sense, even if they oppose the outcomes and on-the-ground policies of the early experiments. These New Leftists oppose capitalist democracy and support the revolutionary Maoism of a generation ago, in contrast to the corruption and what they see as greed in present Chinese society. Many of these New Leftists regret the erosion of guaranteed employment, education, health care, and other former gains of the Chinese Revolution which have been largely lost in the new profit-driven economy. Related movements and incidents According to the Financial Times in 2016, many experts estimate that if there were free elections in China, a neo-Maoist candidate would win. This Maoist revival movement precedes the tenure of Xi Jinping, whose own revival of Mao-era elements seem to be intended as a conciliatory move towards the neo-Maoists. It is believed that the rising popularity of neo-Maoism is due to the growing economic dislocation and inequality under market reforms and globalisation. Neo-Maoists first became prominent under Hu Jintao's administration, delivering far-left attacks on CCP policy from websites such as Utopia, or MaoFlag. They expanded into a political movement through association with the Chongqing Party Secretary and Princeling Bo Xilai, and succeeded in surviving crackdowns. It is believed that the CCP leadership is reluctant to eradicate these groups due to their connection with CCP history and ideology. Maoism and neo-Maoism have been increasingly popular after the rise of Xi Jinping among millennials and poor Chinese people, and they are more frequently covered by foreign media. Due to CPC suppression of proletarian movements and protests, tensions between the party and New Left groups are increasing. The Xi administration, while imposing political controls on businesses, has also promoted greater economic liberalisation in Shenzhen which was then held up as an model for the rest of China. In September 2020, the former mayor and party chief of Shenzhen Li Youwei published a sharply-worded commentary in a Hong Kong newspaper, warning that due to the resurgence of leftists discussing class struggle, China was at a crossroads for economic reform. =Zhengzhou incident= On 24 December 2004, four Chinese protesters were sentenced to three-year prison terms for distributing leaflets entitled \\"Mao Forever Our Leader\\" at a gathering in Zhengzhou honouring Mao Zedong on the anniversary of his birth.Maoists in China Get Three Year Prison Sentences for Leafleting: A Report on the Case of the Zhengzhou Four, Monthly Review, January 2005. Attacking the current leadership as \\"imperialist revisionists,\\" the leaflets called on lower-level cadres to \\"change the current line (of the party) and return to the socialist road\\". The Zhengzhou incident is one of the first manifestations of public nostalgia for the Mao era reported by the international press, although it is unclear whether these feelings are widespread. It is an example of Marxist Chinese New Leftism in action. Chinese New Leftists are often criticised by liberal intellectuals such as Liu Junning, who consider China as not liberal enough economically and politically. These liberals think that inequality and the widening gap between rich and poor are serious problems which exist in every developing country. Democracy and personal freedom are seen as important for China, although perhaps not attainable in the near future. =Chongqing model= Politician Bo Xilai was promoted in October 2007 to party chief of Chongqing, a troubled province with high levels of pollution and unemployment and poor public health. Bo began a policy of expanding state-owned industries in contrast with the rest of China, which was embracing market reforms. He led an economic reform of the region which was known as the Chongqing model and focused on expanding state influence in the economy, anti-corruption campaigns, and the promotion of \\"Red Culture\\". The policy also supported strong public welfare programs for the poor, unemployed, and elderly. Bo began the Red Culture Movement in 2008, which promoted Maoist culture in opposition to the capitalist culture that characterized the Chinese reformists. Radio and television played Maoist propaganda and students were organized to \\"return to the countryside\\" and promote the singing of \\"red songs\\" during this period. From 2009 to 2011, Chongqing began prosecuting alleged Triad members in the Chongqing gang trials. An estimated 4,781 people were arrested during the crackdown. The prosecution was controversial in its use of torture, forced confessions, and inhumane treatment of witnesses. In 2013, Bo was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to life imprisonment; he is incarcerated at Qincheng Prison. Bo was removed as Chongqing's party chief and lost his seat on the Politburo. Bo's supporters formed the Zhi Xian Party to protest his conviction, but it was swiftly banned. =Maoist Communist Party of China= A group of workers and students formed the Maoist Communist Party of China in 2008, an underground, non-recognized political party opposing the ruling Communist Party government. A reported party manifesto, The Ten Declarations of the Maoist Communist Party of China, was posted on the Internet in which the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China was questioned. The party advocates a reversal of the Deng Xiaoping reforms and a return to socialism. = 2015 Luoyang meeting = In February 2015, a group from 13 provinces and municipalities of China, calling themselves \\"Chinese Maoists Communists\\" held a two-day secret meeting in Luoyang, calling for a \\"new socialist revolution\\" to \\"reverse the restoration of capitalism\\". The group seemed to claim to have party elders as backers. The group was quietly arrested. Luoyang was an industrial area that declined after the Chinese economic reforms of the 1990s and experienced extensive unemployment as a result. Maoist nostalgia is pervasive in the city. The neo-Maoists received online support across many blogs, Weibo, and websites such as RedChina.net. However some neo-Maoist groups refused to back it, typically those who regarded Xi Jinping's policies as sufficiently aligned to their neo-Maoist agenda. =Nanjie Village and land reform= National Public Radio's website posted a story about Nanjie on 13 May 2011, calling it a prime example of recent \\"re-collectivizations\\" inspired by Mao's ideas: \\"The furniture and appliances in each home are identical, including the big red clocks with Chairman Mao's head, radiating psychedelic colours to the tune \\"The East Is Red.\\" [Villager] Huang Zunxian owns virtually nothing in his apartment. The possessions are owned by the collective, right down to the couch cushions .... \\"Some villages around the country have followed Nanjie's example and re-collectivized.\\" During the 1990s, rural industry began to stagnate and China's large peasant population was seen as a hindrance to the country's development. Popular demand for further modernization, urbanization and marketization began to outweigh the successes of the previous Township and Village Enterprises. Cui Zhiyuan and Gan Yang began to establish small, rural industries and collectives to mitigate the increasing socioeconomic gap and provide an alternative to large- scale capitalism.Carter, Lance. \\"A Chinese Alternative? Interpreting the Chinese New Left Politically.\\" China Study Group. Insurgent Notes 1, 07/03/2010. Web. 9 May 2012. Archived from original. Although Hegang has had the largest number of laid-off workers since 1996, the city has registered China's highest rate of economic growth. Cui Zhiyuan suggests that the cause of this phenomenon is its \\"combining public land ownership and the market\\"; Hegang has focused on stimulating its real estate market to stimulate the development of related industries.Cui, Zhiyuan. \\"How to Comprehend Today's China.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought. 37.4 (2006): 5. Print. Of the Chinese Communist Party's current ideology, the idea of privatising China's countryside has not been accepted and it remains in public hands. Although most non-urban land is used privately, it cannot be sold (unlike urban property). In 2008, the Third Session of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party () began a new round of land-privatization reforms,The resolution on rural land reform in simplified Chinese can be found at http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2008-10/19/content_10218932_1.htm. but these measures were limited; the transfer of land remains ambiguous, not \\"officially endorsed and encouraged\\".Jialin Zhang, China's Slow-motion Land Reform, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Feb 1, 2010, available at http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/5383. =2017 Guangzhou incident= In November 2017, a group of Maoist students (including Zhang Yunfan) and workers was arrested in Guangzhou for organizing a Maoist salon. =Jasic protests= A number of Maoist- and Marxist-leaning students participated in the July‚ÄìAugust 2018 Jasic Incident, protesting in support of factory workers and workers' rights. The students formed the JASIC Workers Solidarity Group, which included #Me Too advocate Yue Xin. The rally was largely organized through the popular Far-left neo-Maoist online forum website Utopia. On 11 October, fifty student advocates were arrested; their whereabouts are unknown. Political suppression has been expanded to universities, factories and the general public. Student leaders of the Jasic protests have been detained, punished and subjected to forced education by the CPC. =2018 Cultural Revolution anniversary celebrations= On the 52nd anniversary of the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, dozens of neo-Maoists from all over China gathered in Hong Kong for commemorations, saying that their activities had been banned in the mainland. They wore Mao-era blue military uniforms and waved hammer-and-sickle flags. These Maoist groups are highly critical of the CCP's market economics which they claim are responsible for rising inequality and corruption.

It is not a traditional 'language school' as in schools delivering only language teaching. It is a full-time high school providing education to students aged from 11-15 (junior high school) and 15-18 (senior high school). Foreign language teaching is traditionally a specialty. Shanghai Foreign Language School (SFLS), affiliated with the Shanghai International Studies University (SISU), is a seven-year boarding school located in northeast Shanghai. It covers an area of 33 mu, with the total construction area of 22,508 square meters. SFLS was established in 1963, and reports directly to the Chinese Ministry of Education. Location The school is located at 295 Zhongshan Bei Yi Road(), Hongkou District(), Shanghai, China. In February 2012, SFLS campus was temporarily moved to 730 North Station Road (ËΩ¶Á´ôÂåóË∑Ø730Âè∑) because of the demolition and refurbishment project on old school buildings. In September 2015, SFLS moved back to the campus due to the finish of the project. History It was founded in 1963 as one of China's seven earliest foreign language schools in the metropolis. The school is affiliated with the Shanghai International Studies University. It is a full-time boarding school specializing in foreign language education. Receiving funds from China's Ministry of Education, it is a renowned middle school in Shanghai supervised jointly by Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai International Studies University (SISU). Teaching methods SFLS adopts \\"An Integrated Course of English\\" as its main teaching material for English classes. Supplementary materials include \\"Look, Listen and Learn\\" (Louis George Alexander) for students in 6th to 9th grade (Junior High), and \\"Look Ahead Books 3 and 4\\" for students in 9th to 12th grade (Senior High). Languages classes are smaller than other classes, and are usually between 20-25 students. Teaching focuses on cultivating students' oral and written abilities in foreign languages. Some of the teaching activities are conducted by foreign experts. The school is equipped with advanced audio-visual equipment. The school shifted from the traditional teaching methods centering on translation and grammar to a set of \\"elicitation method of teaching in situations\\". This emphasizes the students' audio-lingual skills by training their pronunciation and intonation. Teaching focus In teaching foreign languages, besides emphasizing students' abilities in different practical situations, the school practices the \\"going out and inviting in\\" method. The so-called \\"going out\\" means that a number of students are provided with opportunities to study abroad as exchange students at locations like Sukura Nobirin College in Japan, Christina College in Hamburg, Germany, La Salle College, Hong Kong, and The Culver Academies, in Indiana US. The so-called \\"inviting in\\" means that the school invites foreign visitors so as to provide the students with the opportunity to practice what they have learned in school. Every year, more than 100 students in the school have the chance to receive foreign visitors including members of government delegations, foreign students, and foreign reporters. In order to extend students' scope of knowledge, the school provides additional courses in the form of the Second Classroom, such as: * Second foreign language courses * Selective courses in foreign language study (e.g. Newspaper Reading in Original, Foreign Literature, Foreign History, and Survey of the Countries in the World, etc.) * Public Relations * English of Science and Technology * Cultures and Customs Worldwide * Reading on Ancient Poems Schools *School of English *School of Japanese Culture and Economy *Graduate Institute of Interpretation and Translation *School of International Cultural Exchange Many other schools will be found in the website as follows. Languages *English *Russian *French *German *Spanish *Japanese Seminars In Activities courses, there are seminars on Spare-time Politics school, and workshops such as \\"Green-Grass\\" Literature, Cartoon, Computer, Film Review, Chinese Calligraphy, Sketch, Wind Band, Chorus, Piano, Food Sculpture, Handcraft, and so on. With the help of the League Branch in each class, the school organizes students to read books in groups. The Senior class has a mobile bookshelf whereas a mini library is found in the Junior class. Now half of the classes have put this program into full play. SFLS is the head of the National Association of Foreign Language Teaching and Research of foreign languages schools in China. Research results of the association are exchanged at the annual meeting. Spare-time language education Awards In 1999, SFLS was awarded Advanced Secondary School in moral education in Shanghai. SFLS students have won prizes such as the first prize in the National Japanese Speech Contest, two special awards in the National English Oral Contest (Junior and Senior respectively), the 3rd, 5th and 7th prizes in the National \\"World of Water\\" Contest in German (mainly for Chinese college students). Students of SFLS' \\"Five Elements Group\\" (the only team representing Shanghai) were sent to the USA for the Summit of International High School after competition on the Internet. SFLS students have won many other rewards, such as the first awards, Junior and Senior respectively, in Sino-USA Students' Speech Contest in using the other party's mother tongue; the first and third awards in the global Math Model Contest for college students as well as the first award for four years in a succession in Shanghai's Popular Science English Contest. Modern technology To meet the development of modern science and technology, SFLS provides courses like English of Science and Technology and English Newspaper Reading. It has invested 100,000 Yuan in these science courses.

Its products are made for other corporations developing embedded systems such as automotive electronics, communications equipment, mobile phones, and other electronic devices and infrastructure. MontaVista is based in Santa Clara, California and was founded in 1999 by James \\"Jim\\" Ready (formerly at Mentor Graphics and creator of Versatile Real-Time Executive (VRTX)) and others. On November 10, 2009 Cavium Networks announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to purchase MontaVista for $50 million. After Cavium got acquired by Marvell, Montavista is currently running as independent entity.http://www.mvista.com/company.php Products Linux May 12, 2009, MontaVista announced MontaVista Linux 6 (MVL6) comprising Market Specific Distributions, MontaVista Integration Platform, Software Development Kit, MontaVista Zone Content Server, and support and services. There are several differences between MVL6 and prior MontaVista Linux products. The main ones are: * Market Specific Distributions (MSD)Linux operating systems (kernel + userland) optimized for each specific semiconductor vendor's hardware. * MontaVista Integration Platformbased on BitBake, analogous to make, which analyzes a set of directives and then builds a task dependency tree to satisfy a user command. BitBake then executes the defined tasks to completion. * MontaVista Zone Content Serveraccessed from behind a proxy server, or local web mirror for offline operations, to fetch software and updates. Rather than depending on a mix of public HTTP, Concurrent Versions System (CVS), Git, and Subversion servers across the Internet, there is one source for each original source archive and patch. MontaVista Linux (formerly named Hard Hat Linux) is a Linux distribution that has been enhanced to become a full real-time operating system. The work on real-time performance has since continued to a point where MontaVista claims to support hard real-time tasks on embedded Linux as of MontaVista Linux 4.0, with response times as fast as other real-time operating systems. MontaVista sells subscriptions, which consist of software, documentation, and technical support. The software includes a Linux kernel and toolchain aimed at a specific hardware configuration, collectively called a Linux Support Package (LSP), and other integrated tools including the Eclipse-based DevRocket integrated development environment (IDE). The distribution is available in three editions, each aimed at different market segments: Professional Edition, Carrier Grade Edition, and Mobilinux. The MontaVista Linux toolkit includes specific code libraries to easily migrate from Wind River Systems' VxWorks and the pSOS operating systems. =Professional Edition= MontaVista Professional Edition (Pro) is for general embedded Linux developers who want all the benefits of an open source development platform (open source, Linux, easily accessible software, etc.) and added MontaVista benefits including higher quality (fewer bugs), integration with open source tools for a given hardware architecture, and support. Pro is for intelligent device markets, including networking and communications, instrumentation and control, aerospace and defense, small office/home office (SOHO) devices, and medical devices. Future development of MontaVista Pro has been folded into MontaVista Linux, effectively ending this as a separate edition starting version 5.0.24. =Carrier Grade Edition= MontaVista Linux Carrier Grade Edition (CGE) is a commercial-grade Linux development platform for developers working with reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) managed hardware (Hardware Platform Interface (HPI), Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)) or custom hardware, who need long-term support and high availability. Carrier Grade Linux is governed by the Linux Foundation CGL working group. =Mobilinux= MontaVista Mobilinux is for wireless handsets and other mobile devices such as Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, portable medical devices, and wireless POS terminals. Mobilinux's key features include dynamic power management, real-time performance, fast booting, and small memory footprint. DevRocket MontaVista DevRocket is a set of Eclipse plug-ins for facilitating application and system development with MontaVista Linux. DevRocket integrated development environment (IDE) runs on Linux, Solaris and Windows. It uses the Eclipse C++ Development Toolkit (CDT). Starting with DevRocket 5.0, users can add MontaVista's plug-ins into an existing Eclipse installation, or install Eclipse with the plugins already loaded. DevRocket is available in two varieties: a Platform Developer Kit (PDK) and Application Developer Kit (ADK). The Platform Developer Kit includes the ability to communicate with a target (RSE, SSH), create and manage file systems, debugging (kgdb), and performance tuning (memory leak, memory use, system profiling). The application developer kit includes a virtual target for developing applications earlier in the development cycle, one-click edit/compile/debug, and performance tuning. Open source contributions MontaVista has a history of being a major contributor to the Linux kernel and the open source community. From the start, Jim Ready said he wanted to make it \\"100% pure Linux\\" under the GPL. The core changes to make MontaVista Linux into a real-time operating system were made by Nigel Gamble and later updated by Robert Love. Robert Love submitted the changes to the Linux kernel in 2001. The Linux 2.6 stable kernel series is the first to include similar features, such as priority-based preemption. As of 2008, MontaVista had contributed 1.2% of the Linux kernel, making it the 9th-largest corporate contributor to the Linux kernel, according to a survey by the Linux Foundation.Linux Kernel Development (April 2008) MontaVista has also spun off independent open source projects based on several of its features, including dynamic power management, high resolution POSIX timers, the pramfs file system,Linux.com :: MontaVista Contributes to Open Source for CE Linux and the openais implementation of the Service Availability Forum's (SA Forum) Application Interface Specification. Meld March 3, 2009, MontaVista Software announced Meld embedded Linux community, a community for embedded Linux developers. It essentially is an internet forum specialized in questions and answers on the topics of embedded Linux ‚Äì MontaVista specifically claims that meld targets all embedded Linux users, not just its own customers. As of March, 2014 the community website meld.org is inaccessible. Distribution Other versions of MontaVista Linux are used in devices made by a number of partners, including Sony Bravia TVs, NEC routers, and others, especially in Japan. A version of MontaVista Linux OS is used in Dell Latitude E4200 and E4300 notebooks to provide the Latitude ON feature. Cisco NX-OS is based on HardHat Linux.Brian Feeny - Hacking NX-OS Part 3 Mobile phones Motorola became the first company to use Linux on a mobile phone when it released the Motorola A760 to the Chinese market on February 16, 2003. Motorola chose to use MontaVista Linux in the Motorola A760 and future Linux-based phones, despite the fact that Motorola was a founding member of the competing Symbian OS. Since then, Motorola has increased focus on its Linux platform and publicly stated that the future platform for all its mid- and high-tier mobile phones will be Linux with Java, and other phone manufacturers NEC and Panasonic have developed a common platform based on MontaVista Linux.

Erosion (usually represented by ‚äñ) is one of two fundamental operations (the other being dilation) in morphological image processing from which all other morphological operations are based. It was originally defined for binary images, later being extended to grayscale images, and subsequently to complete lattices. The erosion operation usually uses a structuring element for probing and reducing the shapes contained in the input image.  Binary erosion  In binary morphology, an image is viewed as a subset of a Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^d or the integer grid \\\\mathbb{Z}^d, for some dimension d. The basic idea in binary morphology is to probe an image with a simple, pre- defined shape, drawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the image. This simple \\"probe\\" is called structuring element, and is itself a binary image (i.e., a subset of the space or grid). Let E be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, and A a binary image in E. The erosion of the binary image A by the structuring element B is defined by: ::A \\\\ominus B = {z\\\\in E  B_{z} \\\\subseteq A}, where Bz is the translation of B by the vector z, i.e., B_z = {b+zb\\\\in B}, \\\\forall z\\\\in E. When the structuring element B has a center (e.g., a disk or a square), and this center is located on the origin of E, then the erosion of A by B can be understood as the locus of points reached by the center of B when B moves inside A. For example, the erosion of a square of side 10, centered at the origin, by a disc of radius 2, also centered at the origin, is a square of side 6 centered at the origin. The erosion of A by B is also given by the expression: A \\\\ominus B = \\\\bigcap_{b\\\\in B} A_{-b}, where A‚àíb denotes the translation of A by -b.  Example  Suppose A is a 13 x 13 matrix and B is a 3 x 3 matrix: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Assuming that the origin B is at its center, for each pixel in A superimpose the origin of B, if B is completely contained by A the pixel is retained, else deleted. Therefore the Erosion of A by B is given by this 13 x 13 matrix. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 This means that only when B is completely contained inside A that the pixels values are retained, otherwise it gets deleted or eroded. Properties * The erosion is translation invariant. * It is increasing, that is, if A\\\\subseteq C, then A\\\\ominus B \\\\subseteq C\\\\ominus B. * If the origin of E belongs to the structuring element B, then the erosion is anti-extensive, i.e., A\\\\ominus B\\\\subseteq A. * The erosion satisfies (A\\\\ominus B)\\\\oplus C = A\\\\ominus (B\\\\oplus C), where \\\\oplus denotes the morphological dilation. * The erosion is distributive over set intersection Grayscale erosion Example of erosion on a grayscale image using a 5x5 flat structuring element. The top figure demonstrates the application of the structuring element window to the individual pixels of the original image. The bottom figure shows the resulting eroded image. In grayscale morphology, images are functions mapping a Euclidean space or grid E into \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\cup{\\\\infty,-\\\\infty}, where \\\\mathbb{R} is the set of reals, \\\\infty is an element larger than any real number, and -\\\\infty is an element smaller than any real number. Denoting an image by f(x) and the grayscale structuring element by b(x), where B is the space that b(x) is defined, the grayscale erosion of f by b is given by ::(f\\\\ominus b)(x)=\\\\inf_{y\\\\in B}[f(x+y)-b(y)], where \\"inf\\" denotes the infimum. In other words the erosion of a point is the minimum of the points in its neighborhood, with that neighborhood defined by the structuring element. In this way it is similar to many other kinds of image filters like the median filter and the gaussian filter. Erosions on complete lattices Complete lattices are partially ordered sets, where every subset has an infimum and a supremum. In particular, it contains a least element and a greatest element (also denoted \\"universe\\"). Let (L,\\\\leq) be a complete lattice, with infimum and supremum symbolized by \\\\wedge and \\\\vee, respectively. Its universe and least element are symbolized by U and \\\\emptyset, respectively. Moreover, let { X_{i} } be a collection of elements from L. An erosion in (L,\\\\leq) is any operator \\\\varepsilon: L\\\\rightarrow L that distributes over the infimum, and preserves the universe. I.e.: * \\\\bigwedge_{i}\\\\varepsilon(X_i)=\\\\varepsilon\\\\left(\\\\bigwedge_{i} X_i\\\\right), * \\\\varepsilon(U)=U.

The site is just outside the walls of the ancient Eastern Han capital, some east of Luoyang in Henan Province. It is approximately 40 minutes by bus No. 56 from Luoyang railway station.Elmer, et al. (2009), p. 463. The temple, although small in comparison to many others in China, is considered by most believers as \\"the cradle of Chinese Buddhism\\". The geographical landmarks to the south are Manghan mountain and Lucoche River. The main temple buildings, a large complex, were reconstructed during the Ming (1368 to 1644) and Qing (1644 to 1912) dynasties.Cummings, et al. (1991) p. 283. They were refurbished in the 1950s, and again in March 1973 after the Cultural Revolution. It has numerous halls divided by courtyards and manicured gardens, covering an area of about . The display plaques in Chinese and English give ample descriptions of the Buddhist deities installed in the halls. Significant statues include ≈öƒÅkyamuni Buddha, Maitreya (the laughing Buddha in China), the Jade Buddha, figures of saints such as Guru Avalokite≈õvara, AmitƒÅbha and arhats and stone statues of the two white horses which brought the Indian monks to China and two mythical lions at the entrance. Under international funding, the temple has undergone many changes, both structurally and internally. The most recent cooperative project, with India, was completed in 2008 when the Sanchi Stupa and the Sarnath Buddha statue were erected. Etymology Though destroyed several times in history, the present Qiyun Pagoda was built in 1175White Horse Temple by Jim Down On arrival of the two monks from India, they were housed in the temple. This temple was called the \\"Pi-ma-sai\\" meaning \\"White Horse Temple\\" where 'pi' means \\"white\\", 'ma' means \\"horse\\" and 'sai' or 'ssi' is \\"temple\\". 'Ssi' in Chinese also means residence of Buddhist priests. Notably, the emperor ordered the suffix () to be used in the temple's name, as a display of respect. This character had been used to denote the ministries of the government. In later periods, all temples, even mosques, came to use this character in their name and it was dropped from the names of government ministries. As a result, the temple's name is sometimes translated as White Horse Ministry, a translation true to the time. White Horse Temple is the modern, literal reading. However, this may be a folk etymology as there were other early temples in different centres with the same name. The monk Zhidun (or Chih Tun) (314‚Äì366), who was a famous propagator of Buddhism in the southern capital is recorded as having discussions with Fenghui at the Baima si (Pai ma) monastery in Jiankang (previously Jianye), the capital of the Eastern Jin (317-420).Z√ºrcher (1972), pp. 8, 59, 107, 119, 129. There was also a Baima si at Xiangyang where Daoan and his disciples stayed c. 365.Z√ºrcher (1972), p. 187, To further complicate the search for the origin of the name, there were peoples known as the 'White Horse Qiang' and 'Di' who lived in the 'White Horse Valley' on the upper reaches of the Min River, which flows south from the Min Mountains near the town of Zhangla ([Chang-la]: 32.50¬∞ N, 103.40¬∞ E) and there are still people calling themselves the 'White Horse Di' living there.Draft translation of the Chapter on the Peoples of the West from the Weil≈©e by John E. Hill. It is possible, but unprovable, that the name Baima derived from some of these peoples, who may have been influenced by Buddhism at an early period, rather than from literal white horse(s) carrying scriptures. Background, legends and importance Here are several forms of the legends relating to the foundation and naming of the temple: :Following Emperor Ming's dream vision about a Buddha who established Buddhism, two of Ming's emissaries departed to search for Buddhist scriptures. They encountered two Indian Buddhist monks in Central India and persuaded them to join them and return to China, bringing their book of Buddhist scriptures, relics and statues of Buddha with them on two white horses. Pleased with their arrival in China, the king built a temple in their honour and named it the White Horse Temple or Baima Temple, as an appreciation of the white horses that had carried the monks. The monks resided at the new temple and here they translated the Buddhist scriptures into the Chinese language. The Buddhist religion prospered from here and with the arrival of Bodhidarma, another monk from South India in the 5th century, Chinese Buddhism evolved, spreading to other countries. :At the invitation of the Chinese Emperor Ming Di, two Indian monks named Kasyapa Matanga and Dharmaratna or Gobharana, translated the Buddhist classics at the Baimai Temple at Luo Yang, which was then the nation‚Äôs capital. They translated many scriptures, the notable of these was the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters (), which was translated by Matanga. This was the first Buddhist sutra in Chinese and has the pride of place in the history of Chinese Buddhism. Gobharana translated the 'Dasa Bhumi' or the 'Ten stages of Perfection', apart from five others. The temple then increased in importance as Buddhism grew within China and spread to Korea, Japan and Vietnam. The introduction of Buddhism in China was a significant influence on Chinese morals, thought and ethics. :The temple's story begins with the dream of Emperor Mingdi and his establishing the temple in 68 AD honouring the two Indian monks and the white horses that brought them to China with Buddhist scriptures. The two monks translated many scriptures while living in the temple, which was named as White Horse Temple. They died in the temple precincts and are buried in the first courtyard of the temple. Following the establishment of the temple, 1000 monks lived here practicing Buddhism. According to 'The Chapter on the Western Regions' of the Hou Hanshu (Book of Later Han), which was based on a report to the Emperor c. 125, but was not compiled until the 5th century: :\\"Tradition is that Emperor Ming dreamt that he saw a tall golden man the top of whose head was glowing. He questioned his group of advisers and one of them said: \\"In the West there is a god called Buddha. His body is sixteen chi tall [], and is the colour of gold.\\" That is why the Emperor sent envoys to Tianzhu [South or Central India] to inquire about the Buddha‚Äôs doctrine, after which paintings and statues [of the Buddha] appeared in the Middle Kingdom.\\"Hill (2009), p. 31, and nn. 15.10 to 15.13 on pp. 363‚Äì366. There are differing accounts explaining how the temple was established. Yang Hs√ºan-chih says in the preface to his book, A Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Lo-yang (completed c. 547 CE), that, after his dream, Emperor Ming ordered that statues of the Buddha be erected at the [K'ai-]yang Gate (Opening to the Morning Sun Gate) of the Southern Palace and on near the [Ch'ang]yeh Terrace (The Eternal Night Terrace).Yang (1984), pp. 3‚Äì4. He, however, makes no mention of the temple. The Emperor is said to have sent a monk or monks to India or Scythia who returned carrying the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters on a white horse. The Sutra was received by the Emperor and housed in a temple built outside the walls of Luo Yang. It was China's first Buddhist temple. Other versions mentioned in the book Indian Pandits in the Land of Snow by Sri Sarat Chandra give the following legendary versions: The legends related to this temple have direct link to the emergence and spread of Buddhism in China. Two visions are stated in this context. The first vision was witnessed by Chow Wang, the fifth ruler of the Tang dynasty. The Emperor saw, in the southwestern region of China, a very bright light in the sky, like a halo or aureola from the west which lit the whole space. The astrologers of his court predicted that a saint was born in that quarter of the world where he saw the bright halo light. It was also prophesied that the religion practised by the saintly person, would spread to China. This was recorded by the King in his royal register. This year happened to be the year when Gautam Buddha was born in Nepal. The second vision happened at Luo Yang during the reign of Mingdi, the second Emperor of the Eastern Han Dynasty. In 60 CE, on an auspicious day, the Emperor had a vision (dream) of a saintly person of golden complexion with the Sun and the Moon shining behind his back came near his throne from the heavens and then circled his palace. This incident was correlated with the ancient recorded version and the events were interpreted to mean that the period prophesied in the past, of Buddhism coming to China, was now. History chronicler Fu Hi interpreted this vision as that of the divine person known as Buddha who was born in a place to the west of China in India. Emperor Mingdi forthwith selected emissaries named Taai Yin, Tain King, Wangtrun and others, in all 18 people, to go toward the west to India in search of the religion practiced by Buddha. After travelling through several countries bordering India such as Getse and Yuchi (the Saka Tartars), they reached (Gandhara country) where they met two Buddhist monks (Arhats) named Kasyapa Pandita (a Brahmin from Central India) and Bharana Pandita from South India. They accepted the invitation of the emissaries to go to China. They then proceeded to China on two white horses accompanied by the emissaries. They carried with them a few sacred texts of sutras -- the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters -- statues of Buddha, portraits and sacred relics. They reached Lou Yang where they were put up in a temple. The King met them in 67 CE, with due reverence and was pleased with the presents the monks had brought for him. It was the 30th day in the 12th month of Chinese calendar. The Emperor was particularly happy with the Buddha image which had striking similarity to the one he had seen in his dream vision. At this time, the monks performed some miracles, which further strengthened the belief of the Emperor in Buddhism. However, some Taoist priests protested and wanted the Emperor to test the merits of both parties. The Emperor agreed and convened a meeting at the southern gate of the White Horse Temple. He ordered that the sacred texts and religious paraphernalia of the Taoists be placed on the eastern gate and the sacred texts, relics and Buddha image of the westerners in the hall of seven gems on the west. He then ordered that the objects be thrown into the fire, and whichever documents survived the fire then that religion would receive his patronage. The Taoists expected that their texts would survive. This did not happen as all the texts of Taoists were burnt and that of the Buddhists from the west survived. With this test, the Emperor was convinced of the Buddhist religion. He with all his entourage of ministers and kinsmen embraced Buddhism. He built several temples, which included 'Pai-masai', the White Horse Temple and three convents for nuns. Now that there are many contradictory versions of this story, most modern scholars accept it as a Buddhist fable and not a valid historical event.Maspero (1901), pp. 95 ff.Pelliot (1920b), pp. 395‚Äì396, n. 310Chen (1964), pp. 29‚Äì31.Z√ºrcher (1972), p. 22. The White Horse Temple is not recorded in contemporary sources before 289.Z√ºrcher (1972), p. 31. However, there is a Poma si mentioned in Chang'an in 266 and another of the same name at Jingcheng in central Hubei at about the same date.Z√ºrcher (1972), p. 330, n. 71. It is said that the next year, the Emperor ordered the construction of the White Horse Temple on the south side of the Imperial Drive three li outside the Hsi-yang Gate of the capital Luoyang, to remember the horse that carried back the sutras. After the death of the Emperor a meditation hall was built on his tomb. In front of the stupa luxuriant pomegranate and grape vines were grown which were said to be larger than those elsewhere.Yang (1984), pp. 173‚Äì174, Buddhism evolved in China after arriving from India, as a blend of Chinese beliefs and needs, particularly in respect of its folk heritage. It is Mahayana Buddhism practice, which is widely followed even though the Theravada or Hinayana came to China first. History Early history In 258 a royal Kuchean monk, Po-Yen, translated six Buddhist texts into Chinese at the temple, including the important Infinite Life Sutra. The famous Indo-Scythian Buddhist translator Dharmarak·π£a (), active ca. 266‚Äì308 CE, came to Luoyang in 266 and resided at the White Horse Temple from at least the spring of 289 to 290 CE.Z√ºrcher (1972), pp. 65, 69. Furthermore, the renowned monk Xuanzang of the Tang dynasty, who spent 16 years on a pilgrimage to India (630‚Äì635 CE) as a result of his desire to visit the Buddha's homeland, started his pilgrimage from this temple. On his return, Xuanzang remained the abbot of the White Horse Temple till his death. During his stay, apart from his teaching duties and other religious activities at the temple, he translated many Buddhist scriptures that he had brought from India, skillfully rendering Sanskrit into Chinese. In 1175, an inscription on a stone tablet next to Qilun Pagoda‚Äîa tall, multi- eaved square-based tower to the southeast of the White Horse Temple‚Äîstated that a fire occurred five decades previously and destroyed the temple and the Sakya Tathagata sarira stupa, a predecessor to the pagoda. The same inscription of 1175 stated that a Jin official had the stone Qilun Pagoda erected soon after. The pagoda is built with the design style imitating the square-based pagodas of the Tang Dynasty. Between the 13th century and the 20th century, the temple underwent restoration/renovation under the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) and the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911). Significant restoration took place in the 16th century and some buildings date to this period, although some have since been renovated. Modern history Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia (centre) in China Under the People's Republic of China, the temple has seen many renovations in the period between 1952 and 1973. In 1973, Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia visited the temple. Cambodia was a communist ally of China and Prince Sihanouk was staying in a palatial residence in Beijing. He was permitted to visit parts of the country on a tour for propaganda purposes, to show to the outside world that all was normal within China. As an ardent Buddhist, Sihanouk expressed a wish to Premier Zhou Enlai to visit the White Horse Temple. This put the administration into a frenzy, since many parts of the temple had been damaged during the Cultural Revolution and items were missing. Post haste, 2900 artefacts, which were in other palaces and museums in China, such as the Palace of Benevolent Tranquillity on the western side of the Forbidden City and statues in the Arhat Hall (Luohan Tang) of the Temple of Azure Clouds in Beijing‚Äôs Fragrant Hills were secretly shifted to the temple, and the White Horse Temple was fully restored. The newly restored temple impressed the Cambodians, who were oblivious to the events that had gutted the temple. The shift of artefacts to this temple was announced as permanent by Premier Zhou Enlai when the original owners wanted the artefacts to be returned. In 1992, with the assistance of Thai and Chinese donors, the Hall of the Thai Buddha was constructed slightly west of the old temple. =India-China cultural cooperation= The symbolic importance of the temple for the ancient cultural relations between China and India was demonstrated when the Prime Minister of India P.V. Narasimha Rao visited the temple in 1993. A decade later, in 2003, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also visited the temple. To enhance the Buddhist cultural links between India and China, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed on 11 April 2005. It stipulated that India would build an Indian-style Buddhist temple to the west side of the White Horse Temple, in the International Garden of the complex. Under this agreement, India was to provide the architectural design, material for construction, the Buddha statue, landscaping and technical advice from architects and experts during construction. Chinese authorities were to allot a piece of land of . Following the MOU, a Buddhist shrine that is a close replica of the Sanchi Stupa was completed in 2008. Its presence in the precincts of China's first temple was inspired by Buddhist saints from India. The architectural features of the new temple closely recreate those of Sanchi's Stupa, including Sanchi's east gate. An image of the Buddha was transported from India and consecrated in the new temple, in conformity with the Indian Buddhist tradition. It is worth noticing that this temple was built on land donated by the Chinese government. The shrine is a two-storied structure with circular walls on both floors. Its circular walls are embellished with murals of scenes from the Jataka tales and the life of Buddha. The temple was executed in close co-ordination with the Indian design experts selected for the project, and Architects Akshaya Jain & Kshitij Jain made several visits to the site in relation with their work as consultants. The Buddha statue was designed following the pattern of the 5th-century image of the Buddha kept at Sarnath, and it has been consecrated in the temple's central congressional hall The President of India, Pratibha Patil, inaugurated this temple on May 27, 2010. The new temple incorporates features from the most revered Indian Buddhist shrines of Sanchi and Sarnath. Architecture The Drum Tower The temple faces south and is aligned along a central axis starting from the entrance gate followed by several halls and courtyards in succession. The temple compound covers an area of 200 mu () and faces south. A stone paifang (archway), a three-door covered archway, has been recently built, in front of the original gate. The stone horses at the front of the temple are in the Ming architectural style, representing the white horses which carried the scriptures and the Indian monks to China. Between the archway and gate lies a pool with fountains, crossed by three stone bridges. The two horses at the entrance gate facing each other are made of green stone dated to the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279). Entering the temple today, plaques (in English and Chinese) and signposts are seen, which guide the visitors and pilgrims through the halls. The plaques briefly explain the statues in each hall. The halls are discerned in the inscriptions on the plaques, include the 'Hall of Greetings', 'Hall of Six Founders‚Äô, 'Hall of jade Buddha', the 'Hall of Heavenly Kings', Hall of Mahavira and Hall of Changing Ge (repository of ancient scriptures). In addition, the 'Cool and Clear Terrace' known as the 'Qingliang Terrace' is behind the main hall, the place where the original sutras were translated. This terrace is amidst bamboo forest of old pine trees and has halls which are interconnected. Four sides of the terrace are piled with green bricks. The terrace also has the Kunlu Pavilion with halls on its east and west that house the statues of the two eminent monks, She Moteng and Zhu Falan. They were buried inside the temple gate after they died here; the Bell Tower and the Drum Tower, in front of their tombs, were once prominent sights of Luo Yang City. The Pilu Library The Hall of Heavenly Kings In the courtyard, large burners are kept for worshipers to light incense sticks, creating a pungent odour. In the Main hall and other halls where images are worshiped, the altars are filled with fruit and other offerings made by the devotees. Multicoloured tapestry hang from the ceilings of the halls and lighted candles float in the basins, presenting a divine spiritual setting. The smallest hall is known as the ‚ÄúHall of greetings‚Äù. It is a relatively new building that was built during the 9th year of Guangho period as replacement to the original hall which was burned down at the beginning of the Tonghzi period. This hall has deified statues of three western paradise (Indian) saints. Amitabha, the founder, is at the centre and is flanked by Guru Avalokiteswara, the God of Mercy on the left and Mahashataprapta on the right.: File:A plaque at hall of Greeting.jpg: Official plaque at the Hall of Greeting in the White Horse Temple erected by the Chinese administration of the temple complex The founders of the temple whose statues are worshiped in the ‚ÄòHall of Six Founders‚Äô belonged to the sect of Chan. The names of the founders as displayed in the order of their succession: Bodidharma, the first founder who hailed from ancient India where he was the 28th generation patriarch preaching the Buddhist philosophy; the second was Huike; the third founder was Sengcan; the fourth was Daoxn, the fifth founder was Hongren; and the sixth was Huineng. Subsequent to Huineng, five schools of Buddhism and Seven Orders were established.: File:Plaque at the Hall of Six Founders.jpg: Official plaque of Hall of Six Founders in the White Horse Temple erected by the Chinese administration of the temple complex In the \\"Hall of the Jade Buddha,\\" stands an image of the Sakyamuni Buddha. The tall image made in jade was donated in 1988 by a Chinese man who had settled in Burma. This elegantly sculpted and cherished statue has a precious stone embedded in its forehead. Before it was shifted to this temple in 1992, it had been stored in the Pilu pavilion.: File:Plaque at the hall of Jade Buddha.jpg: Official plaque of Hall of Jade Buddha in the White Horse Temple erected by the Chinese administration of the temple complex The first large hall in the temple complex is known as \\"The Hall of Heavenly Kings,\\" where a statue of the Maitreya, known in China as the laughing Buddha, is the main deity located in the hall's front. This statue is flanked on the eastern and western sides by four heavenly kings, each representing one fourth of the universe. The eastern side is ruled by Chigua (guardian of the State) carrying a Pipa, the western side is controlled by Guangmu (Sharp-seer) with a dragon in his hand, the southern direction is represented by Zengzhang (Growth Protector), carrying an umbrella and the northern direction is represented by Duowen (Knowledge Preserver), carrying a Pagoda. In addition, there is a statue of Skanda (a high ranking heavenly general and defender of Buddhist law) with his back to the Maitreya statue.:File:Plaque at the hall of Malia in White Horse temple.jpg: Official plaque at the entrance to the Hall of Malia in the White Horse Temple, displayed by the Chinese administration of the temple complex The Hall of Changing Ge, built in 1995, is a repository of ancient scriptures, which has more than ten types of Buddhist texts, including the Longzang Jing Dazong Jing, the Dazeng Zong Jing, the Tibet Jing and so forth. An ancient Buddha statue of China is installed at the centre of the repository. The making of this Buddha statue is traced to the Eastern Han dynasty. The statue was misplaced at the early 20th century. However, it was later found in Thailand and was replicated in bronze into two tall statues and then gilded. One of these is deified in the library and the other was sent to Thailand.: File:Plaque1.jpg: Official plaque at the entrance to the repository of ancient scriptures in the White Horse Temple displayed by the Chinese administration of the temple complex A tower in front of the main temple to light incense In the ‚ÄòHall of Mahavira‚Äù, there are statues of three principal Buddhas. The central image is of the Sakyamuni Buddha. This statue is flanked on the left by the Bhavisyajya guru and on the right by Amitabha; these in turn are flanked by two heavenly generals named Weituo and Weili. Statues of 18 arhats adorn the side of the hall. All the statues were made in ramie-cloth during the Yuan dynasty. The walls on both sides are adorned with carvings of ten thousand Buddhists. A statue of Jialan is installed facing north of the backdoor. In the Main Hall, at the altar, there are three statues, the central statue is that of Sakhyamuni Buddha flanked by statue of Manjushri and Samantabhadra. There is a very large bell weighing more than 1 tonne (a figure of 2.5 tonnes is also mentioned), installed during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty, near the altar, which is struck in time during the chanting of prayers by the monks. A community of ten thousand monks resided here during the Tang dynasty.Leffman et al. (2005), pp. 298-299. The inscription on the bell reads: \\"The sound of the Bell resounds in Buddha's temple causing the ghosts in Hell to tremble with fear.\\"Leffman et al. (2005), p. 299. The living quarters of the monks are in an exclusive pagoda, with restricted entry, called the \\"Qiyun Ta,\\" or Qiyun Pagoda. It is approachable after crossing the manicured garden and a bridge to the left of the main temple. This pagoda was built in the 12th century in the fifteenth year of the Dading reign of the Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234). It is a 13 tiered, ), high cubic shaped brick tower. It has been renovated in subsequent periods. The tomb of the famous Tang dynasty official Di Renjie is also located in the eastern end of the complex. Although the temple is open to the public, visitors are closely monitored for security purposes. While the chief abbot stays informed about the country's political situation through a TV installed in his room, monks dwelling in this facility are required to carry an identification card at all times. Cultural relics Statue of Maitreya. Statue of Maitreya A stone statue of Maitreya, which was made in the 6th-century, was stolen and lost to the United States, now it is preserved at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Peony Festival Peony Festival (mudan huahui) is an important flower festival, which is held in Luoyang every year on April 10‚Äì25 and which attracts large crowds to the city and the White Horse Temple. The legend linked to this festival is that peony flower did not follow the orders of the queen Empress Wu of the Tang Dynasty to bloom during winter and she became enraged that it did not obey her command. As a result, she ordered that peony flowers be banished from Xi'an to Luoyang. It is this banishment which is celebrated as the Peony Festival in Luoyang.

Originally developed for binary images, it has been expanded first to grayscale images, and then to complete lattices. The dilation operation usually uses a structuring element for probing and expanding the shapes contained in the input image. Binary dilation The dilation of dark-blue square by a disk, resulting in the light-blue square with rounded corners. In binary morphology, dilation is a shift-invariant (translation invariant) operator, equivalent to Minkowski addition. A binary image is viewed in mathematical morphology as a subset of a Euclidean space Rd or the integer grid Zd, for some dimension d. Let E be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, A a binary image in E, and B a structuring element regarded as a subset of Rd. The dilation of A by B is defined by ::A \\\\oplus B = \\\\bigcup_{b\\\\in B} A_b, where Ab is the translation of A by b. Dilation is commutative, also given by A \\\\oplus B = B\\\\oplus A = \\\\bigcup_{a\\\\in A} B_a. If B has a center on the origin, then the dilation of A by B can be understood as the locus of the points covered by B when the center of B moves inside A. The dilation of a square of size 10, centered at the origin, by a disk of radius 2, also centered at the origin, is a square of side 14, with rounded corners, centered at the origin. The radius of the rounded corners is 2. The dilation can also be obtained by A \\\\oplus B = {z \\\\in E \\\\mid (B^s)_z \\\\cap A eq \\\\varnothing}, where Bs denotes the symmetric of B, that is, B^s={x\\\\in E \\\\mid -x \\\\in B}.  Example  Suppose A is the following 11 x 11 matrix and B is the following 3 x 3 matrix: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 For each pixel in A that has a value of 1, superimpose B, with the center of B aligned with the corresponding pixel in A. Each pixel of every superimposed B is included in the dilation of A by B. The dilation of A by B is given by this 11 x 11 matrix. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0  Properties of binary dilation  Here are some properties of the binary dilation operator * It is translation invariant. * It is increasing, that is, if A\\\\subseteq C, then A\\\\oplus B \\\\subseteq C\\\\oplus B. * It is commutative. * If the origin of E belongs to the structuring element B, then it is extensive, i.e., A\\\\subseteq A\\\\oplus B. * It is associative, i.e., (A\\\\oplus B)\\\\oplus C = A\\\\oplus (B\\\\oplus C). * It is distributive over set union Grayscale dilation In grayscale morphology, images are functions mapping a Euclidean space or grid E into \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\cup{\\\\infty,-\\\\infty}, where \\\\mathbb{R} is the set of reals, \\\\infty is an element greater than any real number, and -\\\\infty is an element less than any real number. Grayscale structuring elements are also functions of the same format, called \\"structuring functions\\". Denoting an image by f(x) and the structuring function by b(x), the grayscale dilation of f by b is given by ::(f\\\\oplus b)(x)=\\\\sup_{y\\\\in E}[f(y)+b(x-y)], where \\"sup\\" denotes the supremum. Flat structuring functions Example of dilation on a grayscale image using a 5x5 flat structuring element. The top figure demonstrates the application of the structuring element window to the individual pixels of the original image. The bottom figure shows the resulting dilated image. It is common to use flat structuring elements in morphological applications. Flat structuring functions are functions b(x) in the form ::b(x)=\\\\left{\\\\begin{array}{ll}0,&x;\\\\in B,-\\\\infty,&\\\\text{otherwise},\\\\end{array}\\\\right. where B\\\\subseteq E. In this case, the dilation is greatly simplified, and given by ::(f\\\\oplus b)(x)=\\\\sup_{y\\\\in E}[f(y)+b(x-y)]=\\\\sup_{z\\\\in E}[f(x-z)+b(z)]=\\\\sup_{z\\\\in B}[f(x-z)]. (Suppose x = (px, qx), z = (pz, qz), then x ‚àí z = (px ‚àí pz, qx ‚àí qz).) In the bounded, discrete case (E is a grid and B is bounded), the supremum operator can be replaced by the maximum. Thus, dilation is a particular case of order statistics filters, returning the maximum value within a moving window (the symmetric of the structuring function support B). Dilation on complete lattices Complete lattices are partially ordered sets, where every subset has an infimum and a supremum. In particular, it contains a least element and a greatest element (also denoted \\"universe\\"). Let (L,\\\\leq) be a complete lattice, with infimum and supremum symbolized by \\\\wedge and \\\\vee, respectively. Its universe and least element are symbolized by U and \\\\varnothing, respectively. Moreover, let { X_{i} } be a collection of elements from L. A dilation is any operator \\\\delta: L\\\\rightarrow L that distributes over the supremum, and preserves the least element. That is, the following are true: * \\\\bigvee_i\\\\delta(X_i)=\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\bigvee_i X_i\\\\right), * \\\\delta(\\\\varnothing)=\\\\varnothing.

It commands a view of the Los Angeles Basin, including Downtown Los Angeles to the southeast, Hollywood to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. The observatory is a popular tourist attraction with a close view of the Hollywood Sign and an extensive array of space and science-related displays. Admission has been free since the observatory's opening in 1935, in accordance with the will of Griffith J. Griffith, the benefactor after whom the observatory is named. Over 7 million people have been able to view through the 12-inch Zeiss refractor, since the Observatory's 1935 opening; this is the most people to have viewed through any telescope. History On December 16, 1896, of land surrounding the observatory was donated to the City of Los Angeles by Griffith J. Griffith.A History of Griffith Observatory. Retrieved on 2014-12-11. In his will Griffith donated funds to build an observatory, exhibit hall, and planetarium on the donated land. Griffith's objective was to make astronomy accessible by the public, as opposed to the prevailing idea that observatories should be located on remote mountaintops and restricted to scientists.Harnisch, Larry. (2013, February 25). A cosmic gift to L.A. The Los Angeles Times: retrieved 2013-02-26. Griffith drafted detailed specifications for the observatory. In drafting the plans, he consulted with Walter Adams, the future director of Mount Wilson Observatory, and George Ellery Hale, who founded (with Andrew Carnegie) the first astrophysical telescope in Los Angeles. As a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project,Kennedy, David (1999). Freedom From Fear, pp. 252‚Äì253, Oxford University Press, USA construction began on June 20, 1933, using a design developed by architect John C. Austin based on preliminary sketches by Russell W. Porter. The observatory and accompanying exhibits were opened to the public on May 14, 1935, as the country's third planetarium. In its first five days of operation the observatory logged more than 13,000 visitors. Dinsmore Alter was the museum's director during its first years. The building combines Greek and Beaux-Arts influences, and the exterior is embellished with the Greek key pattern. During World War II the planetarium was used to train pilots in celestial navigation. The planetarium was again used for this purpose in the 1960s to train Apollo program astronauts for the first lunar missions. Renovation and expansion Side view of the Observatory in 2007 after renovations Griffith Observatory during dawn Griffith Observatory and downtown LA skyline The observatory closed in 2002 for renovation and a major expansion of exhibit space. It reopened to the public on November 3, 2006, retaining its art deco exterior. The $93 million renovation, paid largely by a public bond issue, restored the building, as well as replaced the aging planetarium dome. The building was expanded underground, with completely new exhibits, a caf√©, gift shop, and the new Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater. A wildfire in the hills came dangerously close to the observatory on May 10, 2007. On May 25, 2008, the Observatory offered visitors live coverage of the Phoenix landing on Mars. On October 15, 2017, brush fires approached the Observatory Trail, but were extinguished before causing any structural damage. On July 10, 2018, the Griffith Park Observatory was evacuated after a brush fire burned 25 acres and damaged cars but was extinguished before it damaged any buildings. Ed Krupp is the current director of the Observatory. Exhibits The first exhibit visitors encountered in 1935 was the Foucault pendulum, which was designed to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth.\\"Swinging Pendulum Shows Rotation of Earth\\" Popular Mechanics, April 1935 The exhibits also included a 12-inch (305mm) Zeiss refracting telescope in the east dome, a triple-beam coelostat (solar telescope) in the west dome, and a thirty-eight foot relief model of the moon's north polar region. Col. Griffith requested that the observatory include a display on evolution which was accomplished with the Cosmochron exhibit which included a narration from Caltech Professor Chester Stock and an accompanying slide show. The evolution exhibit existed from 1937 to the mid-1960s. Also included in the original design was a planetarium under the large central dome. The first shows covered topics including the Moon, worlds of the solar system, and eclipses. The planetarium theater was renovated in 1964 and a Mark IV Zeiss projector was installed. The Caf√© at the End of the Universe, an homage to Restaurant at the End of the Universe, is one of the many caf√©s run by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. One wall inside the building is covered with the largest astronomically accurate image ever constructed (152 feet long by high), called \\"The Big Picture\\",http://bigpicture.caltech.edu depicting the Virgo Cluster of galaxies; visitors can explore the highly detailed image from within arm's reach or through telescopes away. In 2006 the 1964-vintage Zeiss Mark IV star projector was replaced with a Zeiss Mark IX Universarium. The former planetarium projector is part of the underground exhibit on ways in which humanity has visualized the skies. Centered in the Universe features a high- resolution immersive video projected by an innovative laser system developed by Evans and Sutherland Corporation, along with a short night sky simulation projected by the Zeiss Universarium. A team of animators worked more than two years to create the 30-minute program. Actors, holding a glowing orb, perform the presentation, under the direction of Chris Shelton. Tickets for the show are purchased separately at the box office within the observatory. Tickets are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Children under 5 are free, but are admitted to only the first planetarium show of the day. Only members of the observatory's support group, Friends Of The Observatory, may reserve tickets for the planetarium show. A model showing the new underground exhibits The observatory is split up into six sections: The Wilder Hall of the Eye, the Ahmanson Hall of the Sky, the W.M. Keck Foundation Central Rotunda, the Cosmic Connection, the Gunther Depths of Space Hall, and the Edge of Space Mezzanine. The Wilder Hall of the Eye, located in the east wing of the main level focuses on astronomical tools like telescopes and how they evolved over time so people can see further into space. Interactive features there include a Tesla coil and a \\"Camera Obscura\\", which uses mirrors and lenses to focus light onto a flat surface. The rotunda ceiling The Ahmanson Hall of the Sky, located in the west wing, focuses on objects that are normally found in the sky, like the Sun and Moon. The main centerpiece of this section is a large solar telescope projecting images of the Sun, using a series of mirrors called coelostats. Exhibits here include a periodic table of the elements, a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and several alcoves showing exhibits about topics like day and night, the paths of the Sun and stars, the seasons, the phases of the Moon, tides, and eclipses. The W.M. Keck Foundation Central Rotunda features several Hugo Ballin murals on the ceiling and upper walls restored since 1934, a Foucault pendulum that demonstrates the Earth's rotation, and a small exhibit dedicated to Griffith J. Griffith, after whom the observatory is named. The Cosmic Connection is a 150 ft long hallway connecting the main building and the underground exhibition areas (see below) that depicts the history of the universe, and dramatizes the amount of time that has passed from the Big Bang to the present day using, hundreds of individual pieces of astronomy-related jewelry. The Gunther Depths of Space Hall is the lower level of the observatory, dominated by \\"The Big Picture,\\" and scale models of the Solar System. The planets (including dwarf planet Pluto) are shown relative to the size of the sun, which is represented by the diameter of the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater. Below each planet are listed facts, as well as scales indicating a person's weight on planets having a solid surface (or weight at an altitude where atmospheric pressure would equal one bar otherwise). In addition, beneath the Earth's model, there is a small room containing a large model Earth globe, an older Zeiss planetarium projector, and a set of seismograph rolls, including one tracking room motion caused by occupants. The other rolls are attached to seismographs monitoring movement at the bedrock level, and indicate actual seismic activity. On the north wall of the Depths of Space is \\"The Big Picture\\", a by photograph (the largest astronomical image in the world) showing a portion of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. This image was taken over the course of 11 nights by the 48-inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Mountain. There is also a bronze statue of Albert Einstein sitting on a bench in the Depths of Space. Einstein is holding his index finger about in front of his eyes, to illustrate the visual area of space that is captured in The Big Picture. The Edge of Space Mezzanine, which overlooks the Depths of Space Hall, focuses more on astronomy related topics that involve celestial bodies much closer to Earth, with exhibits including meteorite displays, an asteroid impact simulator, a cloud and spark chamber, and a large globe of the Moon, and with telescopes that allow a closer inspection of The Big Picture. Tesla coil Tesla coil at the Observatory On display at the Observatory is a large Tesla coil, dubbed \\"GPO-1\\", one of a pair which were built in 1910 by Earle Ovington.Campbell, Robert D. Reminiscences of a Birdman Living History Press, LLC, 2012.Cover page caption The Griffith Observer, August 1965, p. 109 Ovington, who would go on to fame as an aviator, ran a company which built high voltage generators for medical X-ray and electrotherapy devices. In public demonstrations of his generators, the spectacular displays drew crowds. Ovington designed the Observatory's coil to surpass a coil made by Elihu Thomson in 1893 which generated a 64-inch spark. (Nikola Tesla had secretly produced much larger sparks in 1899.) The project caught the attention of an Edison Electric Illuminating Company official, who offered $1,000 if the coil were displayed at an upcoming electrical show in Madison Square Garden, with the stipulation that the machine would produce sparks not less than ten feet long. The machine, dubbed the Million Volt Oscillator was installed in the band balcony overlooking the arena. At the top of each hour the lights in the main hall were shut off, and sparks would shoot from the copper ball atop the coil to a matching coil 122 inches away, or to a wand held by an assistant. The chief engineer of the General Electric Company estimated that the discharges were at least 1.3 million volts. Ovington, who died in 1936, gave the matching Tesla coils to his old electrotherapy colleague Frederick Finch Strong, who in 1937 donated them to Griffith Observatory. The Observatory had room to exhibit only one of the pair. By this time the machine was missing parts, so Observatory staffer Leon Hall restored it with the notable assistance of Hollywood special effects expert Kenneth Strickfaden who designed the special effects for Frankenstein (1931) among many other movies. Visiting Road leading up to the Observatory where additional parking is available. Admission to the building and grounds of Griffith Observatory is free of charge. Planetarium shows at the Observatory are offered eight times a day on weekdays and ten times a day on weekends, of which a nominal fee is charged for admission to the planetarium shows. As long as the weather permits, the Observatory offers free public telescope viewing every night the observatory is open. This includes the historic Zeiss Telescope on the roof, and up to four portable telescopes placed outside offering views of visible celestial objects for the night. At 9:30 pm, the doors to the Zeiss dome close, and lines for the portable telescopes outside stop allowing guests into the queues - though they can close earlier on the busier nights. In poor weather, the roof may be closed to the public, but if still accessible under overcast skies, the Zeiss Telescope can still be visited as an exhibit during viewing hours. There is a small parking lot next to the Observatory, plus more spaces along Western Canyon Rd, which require payment of $8‚Äì10 an hour, depending on the season. During busier times, the roads can get congested and limit access to the top. http://www.griffithobservatory.org/visiting/directions.html#paywebsite=Griffith Park Observatorypublisher=Los Angelesaccessdate=4 April 2017 The Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) operates daily low cost DASH Observatory public bus service from the Vermont/Sunset Metro Red Line station to the Observatory, including a stop at the nearby Greek Theater, which can be used as a free parking area when there are no concerts. The observatory is closed on Mondays. There are photo opportunities and scenery at and around the Observatory, with views of the Pacific Ocean, the Hollywood Sign and Downtown Los Angeles. Filming location Film The observatory was featured in two major sequences of the James Dean film Rebel Without a Cause (1955), which helped to make it an international emblem of Los Angeles. A bust of Dean was subsequently placed at the west side of the grounds. It has also appeared in a number of other movies, including: *The Phantom Empire (1935)\\"Cowboys And Robots: the Birth of the Science Fiction Western\\" by Jeffrey Richardson.

In mathematical morphology, opening is the dilation of the erosion of a set A by a structuring element B: :A\\\\circ B = (A\\\\ominus B)\\\\oplus B, \\\\, where \\\\ominus and \\\\oplus denote erosion and dilation, respectively. Together with closing, the opening serves in computer vision and image processing as a basic workhorse of morphological noise removal. Opening removes small objects from the foreground (usually taken as the bright pixels) of an image, placing them in the background, while closing removes small holes in the foreground, changing small islands of background into foreground. These techniques can also be used to find specific shapes in an image. Opening can be used to find things into which a specific structuring element can fit (edges, corners, ...). One can think of B sweeping around the inside of the boundary of A, so that it does not extend beyond the boundary, and shaping the A boundary around the boundary of the element. Properties * Opening is idempotent, that is, (A\\\\circ B)\\\\circ B = A\\\\circ B. * Opening is increasing, that is, if A\\\\subseteq C, then A\\\\circ B \\\\subseteq C\\\\circ B. * Opening is anti- extensive, i.e., A\\\\circ B\\\\subseteq A. * Opening is translation invariant. * Opening and closing satisfy the duality A \\\\bullet B = (A^{c} \\\\circ B^{c})^{c}, where \\\\bullet denotes closing.  Extension: Opening by reconstruction  In morphological opening (A\\\\ominus B)\\\\oplus B , the erosion operation removes objects that are smaller than structuring element B and the dilation operation (approximately) restores the size and shape of the remaining objects. However, restoration accuracy in the dilation operation depends highly on the type of structuring element and the shape of the restoring objects. The opening by reconstruction method is able to restore the objects more completely after erosion has been applied. It is defined as the reconstruction by geodesic dilation of n erosions of F by B with respect to F : O_R^{(n)}(F) = R_F^{D}[ (F\\\\ominus nB)], where (F\\\\ominus nB) denotes a marker image and F is a mask image in morphological reconstruction by dilation. R_F^{D}[ (F\\\\ominus nB)] = D_F^{(k)}[ (F\\\\ominus nB)], D denotes geodesic dilation with k iterations until stability, i.e., such that D_F^{(k)}[ (F\\\\ominus nB)] = D_F^{(k-1)}[ (F\\\\ominus nB)]. Since D_F^{(1)}[ (F\\\\ominus nB)] = ([ (F\\\\ominus nB)]\\\\oplus B)\\\\cap F , the marker image is limited in the growth region by the mask image, so the dilation operation on the marker image will not expand beyond the mask image. As a result, the marker image is a subset of the mask image (F\\\\ominus nB)\\\\subseteq F. (Strictly, this holds for binary masks only. However, similar statements hold when the mask is not binary.) The images below present a simple opening-by-reconstruction example which extracts the vertical strokes from an input text image. Since the original image is converted from grayscale to binary image, it has a few distortions in some characters so that same characters might have different vertical lengths. In this case, the structuring element is an 8-pixel vertical line which is applied in the erosion operation in order to find objects of interest. Moreover, morphological reconstruction by dilation, R_F^{D}[ (F\\\\ominus nB)] = D_F^{(k)}[ (F\\\\ominus nB)] iterates k = 9 times until the resulting image converges.

He took part in the war against the PDPA government in the 1980s, leading the Afghan mujahideen faction Ittehad-al-Islami (Islamic Union). During the war, he had close relations with Saudi Arabia and he received support from Arab sources and mobilized Arab volunteers for the mujahideen forces. Sayyaf is said to have been the one who first invited Osama bin Laden to take refuge in Afghanistan (Jalalabad), after bin Laden's 1996 expulsion from Sudan by the otherwise sympathetic Sudanese r√©gime under Saudi, Egyptian, and American pressure. He was a member of the Northern Alliance,Layden-Stevenson, Justice. This Party youngest member is Maiwand Safa and general secretary of the party. \\"Hassan Almrei and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and Solicitor General for Canada\\", \\"Reasons for Order and Order\\", 5 December 2005 despite his close relationship with Saudi Arabia that supported the opposing Taliban militia. In 2005, Sayyaf's Islamic Union was converted into a political party and he was elected as a member of the Afghan Parliament. He maintains political influence. Biography Sayyaf is an ethnic Pashtun. Sayyaf () is an Arabic word that means \\"the person who is skilled with the sword.\\" He is fluent in Arabic and holds a degree in religion from Kabul University and a masters from the illustrious Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. He has been described as \\"a big, beefy man with fair skin and a thick gray beard.\\" Sayyaf is reported to be approximately in height and weigh . \\"He usually wears a white skullcap or a large turban, and a traditional Afghan partug kameez, a tunic with loose pants.\\" He was also noted for his photographic memory; Abdullah Anas, one of the leading Afghan Arabs, recalls in his memoirs that \\"once when the hugely influential Abu'l Hassan al-Nadawi, known as the Syed Qutb of India, was delivering a lecture at Kabul University, Sayyaf translated the whole lecture into Persian word for word without mistakes after the former had finished delivering the entire lecture.\\"Abdullah Anas, To the Mountains: My Life in Jihad, from Algeria to Afghanistan, C. Hurst & Co. (2019), p. 42 Sayyaf was a member of the Afghan-based Ikhwan al-Muslimin, founded in 1969 by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Dr. Burhanuddin Rabbani and having strong links to the original and much larger Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Ustad (Professor) Abdul was a professor at the Shariat (Islamic law) faculty of Kabul University until 1973, when he plotted with his group to overthrow President Mohammed Daoud Khan. The uprising attempt in July 1975, in Panjshir Valley, failed significantly and he was forced to flee to Pakistan but was arrested when he returned. However another account claims Sayyaf was not part of the plot but was merely arrested by the government for his ideology. As a warlord Soviet war and Bin Laden friendship Afghan Mujahid commander in 1984. Being imprisoned by the Communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) in April 1978, he was freed in controversial circumstances by the second PDPA leader Hafizullah Amin, who, coincidentally, happened to be Sayyaf's distant relative. Although, by virtue of him being incarcerated, and, consequently not arriving in Peshawar until 1980, until after the actual Soviet intervention, he was recognized by the Pakistanis as the leader of the Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan (Ittihad-i-Islami Baraye Azadi Afghanistan), a coalition of several parties fighting the Soviet and Afghan government forces. The Islamic Union soon imploded, and Sayyaf retained the name as the title of his own organization. After presenting his organization and the jihad to Arabs in Saudi Arabia, Sayyaf is thought to have been most responsible for internationalizing the Afghan jihad against the Soviets, and thus creating a vocal point of concerns to Muslims in the Middle East. Sayyaf further made a name change and growing his beard very long, which were symbols of his close relations with the royal Saudis and their Wahhabist tradition. Sayyaf fought against Soviet occupying forces in Afghanistan during the 1980s, and was generously financed, and apparently favoured, by Saudi Arabia, seemingly due to his close religious affinities with the Wahhabist Saudi Royal and religious establishment and above mentioned excellent command of the Arabic language. During the jihad against the Soviet Union and its Afghan allies, he formed a close relationship with Osama bin Laden. Together in the Jalalabad area they established a training camp network, later used by Al-Qaeda personnel, with bunkers and emplacements. In 1981, Sayyaf formed and headed the Ittihad-i- Islami Baraye Azadi Afghanistan, or Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan. In 1985, he founded a university in an Afghan refugee camp near Peshawar called Dawa'a al-Jihad, (Call of Jihad), which has been described the \\"preeminent school for terrorism.\\" Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who masterminded the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, attended it. Despite his growing wealth, he continued to live a spartan life, avoiding modern conveniences like mattresses and air conditioning; although he enjoyed a nightly game of tennis. During the post-war period, Sayyaf retained his training camps, using them for militarily training and indoctrinating new recruits to fight in Islamic-backed conflicts such as Chechnya, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in the Southern Philippines, where his name inspired the Abu Sayyaf group.https://ctc.usma.edu/the-sources-of-the-abu-sayyafs-resilience-in-the- southern-philippines/ Also, in these camps, Sayyaf trained and mentored the soon-to-be-infamous, Kuwaiti-born, future Al-Qaeda operative and senior commander, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, after being introduced by the latter's brother, Zahid, during the Afghan Jihad in 1987. Battle of Kabul After the forced withdrawal of the demoralised Soviet forces in 1989, and the overthrow of the Mohammad Najibullah regime in 1992, Sayyaf's organization's human rights record became noticeably worse, underlined by their involvement in the infamous massacres and rampages in the Hazara Kabul neighbourhood of Afshar in 1992-1993 during the Battle of Kabul. Sayyaf's faction was responsible for, \\"repeated human butchery\\", when his faction of Mujahideen turned on civilians and the Shia Hezb-i Wahdat group in west Kabul starting May 1992. Amnesty International reported that Sayyaf's forces rampaged through the mainly Shi'ite Tajik (Qizilbash) Afshar neighborhood of Kabul, slaughtering and raping inhabitants and burning homes. Sayyaf, who was allied with the de jure Kabul government of Burhanuddin Rabbani, did not deny the abductions of Hazara civilians, but merely accused the Hezb-i Wahdat militia of being an agent of the theocratic Iranian government. Opposition to the Taliban Sayyaf claimed and claims he is a vituperative opponent of the like-minded Taliban movement, which is the reason he officially joined the Northern Alliance, despite his aforementioned religious and ideological affinities with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Sayyaf was initially the only Pashtun leader part of the Northern Alliance fighting against the Taliban. Sayyaf is rumored to have helped Arab suicide assassins to kill the Northern Alliance leader, Ahmad Shah Massoud. He is also rumored to have helped during their preparations, raising suspicion he was involved in killing Massoud. Since 2001 2003 Constitutional Loya Jirga In 2003, Sayyaf was elected as one of the 502 representatives at the Constitutional Loya Jirga in Kabul, chairing one of the working groups. Originally wanted Loya Jirga intended to divide the 502 delegates randomly among 10 working groups, but Sayyaf objected, suggesting delegates be divided among the groups to ensure equal distribution of professional expertise, provincial origin, gender and other criteria. \\"Those who know the constitution, the ulema [Islamic scholars], and the lawyers should be split into different groups so that the results of the discussion and debate will be positive, and closer to each other,\\" said Sayyaf. Abdul Sayyaf's influence in the convention was felt further when his ally Fazal Hadi Shinwari was appointed by Hamid Karzai as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, in violation of the constitution, as Fazal was over the age limit and trained only in religious, not secular, law. Shinwari packed the Supreme Court with sympathetic mullahs, called for Taliban-style punishments and renewed the Taliban-era Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which was renamed the Ministry of Haj and Religious Affairs. Member of parliament He launched his newly converted Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan party in 2005 and was elected as a member of parliament that same year in parliamentary elections. Later in 2005 he was running for Speaker of the Lower House, where he surprisingly gained the support of Muhammad Mohaqiq, an ethnic Hazara and former member of the Hazara militia that fought against Sayyaf's militia in west Kabul in the 1990s. Although Sayyaf lost the Speaker election to Yunus Qanuni, Mohaqiq's support helped to fix the relationship between Sayyaf and Hazaras. During his years as MP and in the 2010s, Sayyaf has become an influential elderly lawmaker, presenting himself as a \\"voice of wisdom\\". He was noted as being having the \\"greatest authority\\" to speak on religious matters. Sayyaf was a loyal supporter of the incumbent president, Hamid Karzai. However he controversially supported a bill granting amnesty for former mujahideen warlords accused of crimes in the past. On the first anniversary of Burhanuddin Rabbani's assassination, Sayyaf spoke at a gathering saying that the actions of suicide bombers are against Islam and unforgivable by God. Sayyaf announced himself as a candidate for the President of Afghanistan in the 2014 election, campaigning in fighting against corruption and in favor of women's rights. He received 7.04% of the vote in the first round, as the candidate for the aforementioned Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan, and winning Kandahar Province. In 2015, Sayyaf strongly criticized the Taliban in a speech, calling their actions \\"un- Islamic\\" and called the group \\"slaves of Pakistan\\" ‚Äì his remarks were widely hailed by different Afghan social segments. On proposed peace talks with the Taliban in 2018, Sayyaf commented that peace is the \\"order of Allah\\". In April 2019, Sayyaf was chosen by President Ghani to chair the four-day loya jirga for peace efforts, attended by 3,200 representatives in Kabul. He called for unity in his opening remarks. In his main speech, Sayyaf stressed the importance of women's rights, saying \\"The Prophet of Islam is also a descendant of a woman\\", and called defending women a \\"religious principle\\". This countered reports from the western press that he is a hardliner opposed to women's rights.

The character, who is the eponymous spaceship's onboard computer, has been played by Norman Lovett (series I-II, VII-VIII, XII, The Promised Land) and Hattie Hayridge (series III-V). Actors The character was played by Norman Lovett in Series I and II. In series III the character had a \\"head sex change\\" and was played by Hattie Hayridge. Hayridge played the part of Holly from Series III‚ÄìV. Holly did not appear in Series VI, but reappeared in the Series VII finale as the original male version, again played by Lovett. The male version of Holly appeared throughout Series VIII, but does not appear in Red Dwarf: Back to Earth, Series X, or Series XI. Lovett reprised the role for the final episode of Series XII and will appear in the role again in an extended special episode The Promised Land in 2020. Doug Naylor also revealed on Twitter that Lovett's return was permanent for any future series or specials. In the unaired pilot for the American version of Red Dwarf, Holly was played by Jane Leeves. Appearance Holly is an \\"intelligent\\" computer. Holly's user interface appears on ship screens as a disembodied human head on a black background, and can also be downloaded into a watch worn by Lister, Kryten's chest display, and on a motorcycle speedometer when the crew visited Waxworld. In Series I his face appears pixelated, but this idea was dropped in Series II. As a male, Holly appears to be approximately 50 years old and has receding brown hair. Holly with her female face, from Series III‚ÄìV. After meeting his female counterpart, Hilly, in the series 2 episode Parallel Universe he fell so madly in love with her that he had a \\"computer sex change\\" and based his new face on hers. As a female, Holly appears to be approximately 30 years old and has shoulder-length blonde hair and red lipstick. In series VII‚ÄìVIII, the upgraded male version of Holly appears to be around 60 years old with receding grey hair and a bald patch. In 'Skipper', the final episode of Series XII, Holly re-appears in a brief appearance when Rimmer travels to a point in time where the crew are about to be killed by the radiation leak as demonstrated in The End. He appears to be approximately 70 years and has less hair than his previous appearances, but that hair has become more grey. Character Holly is the ship's Tenth Generation AI hologrammatic computer. After releasing Dave Lister from stasis in The End, Holly told him that the crew have been wiped out by a radiation leak and that he had spent three million years in stasis. Holly prides himself on the fact he had an IQ of 6,000, but after three million years by himself, he had become computer senile, or as Holly put it, \\"a bit peculiar\\". The crew often ridicule Holly on his senility, but Holly often comes out on top. He often plays practical jokes on the crew, such as fooling Lister into thinking that NORWEB Federation space fighters were after him and wanted ¬£180 billion in arrears for leaving his bathroom light on three million years ago, as well as wanting to arrest him for \\"Crimes against Humanity\\" as he had left some mouldy German sausages alone in his apartment for three million years and now the mould covered 7/8 of the Earth's surface. This love of practical jokes culminated in his generating an alternate personality, Queeg, and passing him off as the ship's backup computer which was seizing control of the ship; Holly's Queeg persona is portrayed by Charles Augins in the episode. Holly always speaks in a droll, slightly monotonous, and quiet voice, even when sounding alarms, which consist of himself speaking simply \\"Ding-dong. There's an emergency going on. (pauses) It's still going on.\\" and repeating as much. He often greets the crew with \\"All right dudes?\\" Among his achievements was the invention of Hol Rock, where he decimalised music (having ten notes instead of eight‚Äîalthough he admits that this would result in \\"piano keyboards being the width of a zebra crossing, and women being banned from playing the cello\\"). He also wrote an A-Z guide of the Universe. He was friends with another computer called Gordon, who had an IQ of 8,000 and was an Eleventh Generation AI hologrammatic computer. Gordon resembled Holly in that he was represented as a balding middle-aged man. Despite having a higher IQ than Holly, Gordon showed a lesser understanding of technology than Holly. One of the more worrying aspects of Holly's senility is that he has developed a blind spot for the number 7. When he invents the Holly Hop Drive, he claims that one mistake in his 13 billion calculations and they would be blown up. He then misses the seven in his countdown, possibly the cause of the error that sent them to the parallel universe. Holly runs most of Red Dwarf's systems, although in several episodes such as Quarantine, Holly is shown to not have complete control of Red Dwarf, and in Holly's absence in Series VI and VII, a computer is mentioned by the crew, and is seen to control autopilot. Holly was lost for some time, along with the ship, which had been stolen by Kryten's nanobots. He was found on a planet made of junk from Red Dwarf, having reverted to his original male form, and was downloaded into Lister's Holly-watch. When the nanobots rebuilt the ship, there were two versions of Holly: the original, who usually remains in the watch, and a rebuilt version who had not suffered the effects of three million years alone. The non-senile version only appeared in one episode, Back In the Red, Part III, and was distinguished by having an enormous forehead shaped like an egg. The original Holly then states that he was responsible for re-engineering the Nanobots to resurrect the dead crew, all for the purposes of distracting Lister from going insane. In Red Dwarf: Back to Earth it is revealed that sometime after the events of Only The Good... Holly is offline due to water damage,Red Alert, p. 8, SFX, Issue 181, April 2009 later elaborated as being the result of Lister leaving a bath running in the officers' quarters for nine years and the water subsequently flooding the ship. Kryten briefly mentions Holly in the series X episode Fathers and Suns, saying that the crew \\"miss\\" him before installing Pree, another computer. Holly made a return appearance in the final episode of Series XII (\\"Skipper\\"), once again played by Lovett. This version of Holly was still senile but located in an alternate universe which Rimmer enters, set just before the crew are wiped out by the radiation leak. In Red Dwarf: The Promised Land, Lister discovers Holly's back-up personality disc and uses it to reactivate him, but the 'new' Holly, although once again smart, begins steps to destroy the ship as he concludes it is no longer fulfilling a worthwhile function for the company. Temporarily retreating to Starbug, the crew are eventually able to trick the new Holly into downloading the experiences of the original from the Red Dwarf archives, which restores his senility but also his old personality, prompting him to help them reclaim the ship from the rogue Cats.

He was born in Unity, Maine but the family home was the Winnecook Ranch in Montana, which had been founded by his father Ralph in 1880. In 1897, he moved with his mother and two cousins to Redlands, California. Berry received a B.S. (1909) from Stanford and his M.S. (1910) from Harvard. He then returned to Stanford for his Ph.D. work on cephalopods and got his doctorate in 1913. From 1913 until 1918, he worked as a librarian and research assistant at the Scripps Institution for Biological Research in La Jolla, California. This was the last paid employment he ever held in academia--all his later studies and expeditions were financed by the profits from the family ranch in Montana. Despite his independent status, he became a renowned malacologist, publishing 209 articles and establishing 401 mollusc taxa. Most of his work dealt with chitons, cephalopods, and also land snails. Berry also had an interest in horticulture, where he concentrated on the hybridization of irises and daffodils. For some time, from the 1920s until the late 1940s, he even ran a horticultural business from Winnecook Ranch, which he had taken over after the death of his father in 1911. In 1917 he became the president of the Winnecook Ranch Company, a post he occupied until his death in 1984. Book Berry, S.

The permissibility of time travel is represented mathematically by the existence of closed timelike curves in some solutions to the field equations of general relativity. The chronology protection conjecture should be distinguished from chronological censorship under which every closed timelike curve passes through an event horizon, which might prevent an observer from detecting the causal violation (also known as chronology violation). Origin of the term In a 1992 paper, Hawking uses the metaphorical device of a \\"Chronology Protection Agency\\" as a personification of the aspects of physics that make time travel impossible at macroscopic scales, thus apparently preventing time paradoxes. He says: The idea of the Chronology Protection Agency appears to be drawn playfully from the Time Patrol or Time Police concept, which has been used in many works of science fiction such as Poul Anderson's series of Time Patrol stories or Isaac Asimov's novel The End of Eternity, or in the television series Doctor Who. \\"The Chronology Protection Case\\" by Paul Levinson, posits a universe that goes so far as to murder any scientists who are close to inventing any means of time travel. General relativity and quantum corrections Many attempts to generate scenarios for closed timelike curves have been suggested, and the theory of general relativity does allow them in certain circumstances. Some theoretical solutions in general relativity that contain closed timelike curves would require an infinite universe with certain features that our universe does not appear to have, such as the universal rotation of the G√∂del metric or the rotating cylinder of infinite length known as a Tipler cylinder. However, some solutions allow for the creation of closed timelike curves in a bounded region of spacetime, with the Cauchy horizon being the boundary between the region of spacetime where closed timelike curves can exist and the rest of spacetime where they cannot. One of the first such bounded time travel solutions found was constructed from a traversable wormhole, based on the idea of taking one of the two \\"mouths\\" of the wormhole on a round-trip journey at relativistic speed to create a time difference between it and the other mouth (see the discussion at Wormhole#Time travel). General relativity does not include quantum effects on its own, and a full integration of general relativity and quantum mechanics would require a theory of quantum gravity, but there is an approximate method for modeling quantum fields in the curved spacetime of general relativity, known as semiclassical gravity. Initial attempts to apply semiclassical gravity to the traversable wormhole time machine indicated that at exactly the moment that wormhole would first allow for closed timelike curves, quantum vacuum fluctuations build up and drive the energy density to infinity in the region of the wormholes. This occurs when the two wormhole mouths, call them A and B, have been moved in such a way that it becomes possible for a particle or wave moving at the speed of light to enter mouth B at some time T2 and exit through mouth A at an earlier time T1, then travel back towards mouth B through ordinary space, and arrive at mouth B at the same time T2 that it entered B on the previous loop; in this way the same particle or wave can make a potentially infinite number of loops through the same regions of spacetime, piling up on itself. Calculations showed that this effect would not occur for an ordinary beam of radiation, because it would be \\"defocused\\" by the wormhole so that most of a beam emerging from mouth A would spread out and miss mouth B.Thorne 1994, p. 507 But when the calculation was done for vacuum fluctuations, it was found that they would spontaneously refocus on the trip between the mouths, indicating that the pileup effect might become large enough to destroy the wormhole in this case.Thorne 1994, p. 517 Uncertainty about this conclusion remained, because the semiclassical calculations indicated that the pileup would only drive the energy density to infinity for an infinitesimal moment of time, after which the energy density would die down. But semiclassical gravity is considered unreliable for large energy densities or short time periods that reach the Planck scale; at these scales, a complete theory of quantum gravity is needed for accurate predictions. So, it remains uncertain whether quantum-gravitational effects might prevent the energy density from growing large enough to destroy the wormhole.Everett and Roman 2012, p. 190 Stephen Hawking conjectured that not only would the pileup of vacuum fluctuations still succeed in destroying the wormhole in quantum gravity, but also that the laws of physics would ultimately prevent any type of time machine from forming; this is the chronology protection conjecture.Everett and Roman 2012, p. 191 Subsequent works in semiclassical gravity provided examples of spacetimes with closed timelike curves where the energy density due to vacuum fluctuations does not approach infinity in the region of spacetime outside the Cauchy horizon. However, in 1997 a general proof was found demonstrating that according to semiclassical gravity, the energy of the quantum field (more precisely, the expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor) must always be either infinite or undefined on the horizon itself. Both cases indicate that semiclassical methods become unreliable at the horizon and quantum gravity effects would be important there, consistent with the possibility that such effects would always intervene to prevent time machines from forming. A definite theoretical decision on the status of the chronology protection conjecture would require a full theory of quantum gravityThorne 1994, p. 521 as opposed to semiclassical methods. There are also some arguments from string theory that seem to support chronology protection, but string theory is not yet a complete theory of quantum gravity. Experimental observation of closed timelike curves would of course demonstrate this conjecture to be false, but short of that, if physicists had a theory of quantum gravity whose predictions had been well-confirmed in other areas, this would give them a significant degree of confidence in the theory's predictions about the possibility or impossibility of time travel. Other proposals that allow for backwards time travel but prevent time paradoxes, such as the Novikov self-consistency principle, which would ensure the timeline stays consistent, or the idea that a time traveler is taken to a parallel universe while his original timeline remains intact, do not qualify as \\"chronology protection\\".

He is distinguished for his diverse repertoire, distinctive sound deployed with his use of gut strings and command of phrasing. Early life and studies Isserlis was born in London on 19 December 1958 into a musical family. His grandfather, Julius Isserlis,Gdal Saleski, Singers of Jewish origin (1927). \\"JULIUS ISSERLIS Julius Isserlis, who is one of the most outstanding of the many pianists Russia has given to the world in the present generation, was born in Kishineff, Russia, on October 26, 1889.\\" who was a Russian Jew, was one of 12 musicians allowed to leave Russia in the 1920s to promote Russian culture, but he never returned. On the Midweek programme on 29 January 2014, Steven Isserlis revealed that on arrival in Vienna in 1922, his pianist grandfather and father found a flat, but the 102-year-old landlady refused to take in a musician, because her aunt had a previous musician tenant who was noisy and would spit on the floor‚Äîthis tenant was Ludwig van Beethoven. Steven's mother was a piano teacher, and his father was a keen amateur musician. His sister Annette is a viola player, and his other sister Rachel is a violinist. Isserlis has described how \\"playing music, playing together\\", was an integral part of his early family life. He went to the City of London School, which he left at the age of 14 to move to Scotland to study under the tutelage of Jane Cowan. From 1976 to 1978 Isserlis studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music with Richard Kapuscinski. Ever since his youth Daniil Shafran has been his cello hero, of whom Isserlis has described how \\"His vibrato, his phrasing, his rhythm all belonged to a unique whole... He was incapable of playing one note insincerely; his music spoke from the soul.\\"Steven Isserlis: \\"Recollections of Daniil Shafran\\", Classicus.jp, 1998 The name 'Isserlis' is one of many European variations of the Hebrew name 'Israel'.Hanks & Hodges 'A Dictionary of Surnames' (Oxford, 1988). Professional life Steven Isserlis performs solo, in chamber concerts, and with orchestra. He is a staunch advocate of lesser-known composers and of greater access to music for younger audiences. Isserlis is committed to authentic performance and frequently performs with the foremost period instrument orchestras. He has performed Beethoven with fortepianist Robert Levin in Boston and London, and Dvo≈ô√°k's Cello Concerto with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under Sir Simon Rattle. He has also published several editions and arrangements, principally for Faber Music, and was an advisor on new editions of Beethoven's cello sonatas and cello variations, as well as the cello concertos of Dvo≈ô√°k and Elgar. He commissioned a new completion of Prokofiev's Cello Concertino from the Udmurt musicologist Vladimir Blok, which was premiered on 11 April 1997 in Cardiff, with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales conducted by Mark Wigglesworth. At the other end of the spectrum, Isserlis has premiered works by composers John Tavener (who wrote The Protecting Veil especially for the cellist), Lowell Liebermann, Carl Vine, David Matthews, John Woolrich, Wolfgang Rihm, Mikhail Pletnev and Thomas Ad√®s. Isserlis plays the Marquis de Corberon cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. He also part-owns a Montagnana cello from 1740 and a Guadagnini cello of 1745, which he played exclusively from 1979 to 1998 and part-owns with David Waterman, cellist of the Endellion Quartet. His De Munck Stradivarius was returned to the Nippon Music Foundation in May 2011. Isserlis made his debut directing from the cello in February 2008, with the Irish Chamber Orchestra at the National Concert Hall in Dublin. He has organized a number of festivals with long-term collaborators such as Joshua Bell, Stephen Hough, Mikhail Pletnev, Andr√°s Schiff, Denes Varjon, Olli Mustonen and Tabea Zimmermann, and actors Barry Humphries and Simon Callow. He is artistic director of the International Musicians Seminar, Prussia Cove in West Cornwall, where he both performs and teaches. Isserlis's recordings reflect the breadth and eclecticism of his repertoire. His most recent release of reVisions for BIS includes arrangements and reconstruction of works by Debussy, Ravel, Prokofiev and Bloch. For Hyperion Records, Isserlis has recorded Schumann's music for cello and piano (D√©nes V√°rjon), and the complete solo cello suites by Bach, which has won many awards, including Listeners' Disc of the Year on BBC Radio 3's CD Review, Gramophone's Instrumental Disc of the Year, and \\"Critic's Choice\\" at the 2008 Classical Brits. Other releases include two recordings with Stephen Hough: the Brahms sonatas, coupled with works by Dvo≈ô√°k and Suk; a highly acclaimed disc of children's cello music for BIS Records; and a recording with Thomas Ades of his new piece 'Lieux Retrouves'. Recent releases included a disc in 2013 of the Dvorak Cello Concerto with the Daniel Harding and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra on Hyperion and Martinu's complete cello sonatas along with a cello sonata by Olli Mustonen and Malinconia by Sibelius with the pianist/composer Olli Mustonen on the BIS label in 2014 which received a Grammy nomination. In 2017, his recording of Haydn's Cello Concertos was nominated for a Grammy Award. Writing Steven Isserlis is the author of two books for children on the lives of famous composers: the first is Why Beethoven Threw the Stew (Faber & Faber, 2001), and the second is Why Handel Waggled His Wig (Faber & Faber, 2006). He has also written three stories that have been set to music by Oscar- winning composer Anne Dudley. The first of the series Little Red Violin (and the Big, Bad Cello) received its first performance in New York in March 2007, followed by Goldipegs and the Three Cellos, and Cindercella (published by Universal Edition, Vienna). He has also made several additions for Faber Music and sheetmusicnow.com. In September 2016, his book targeted towards young musicians Robert Schumann's Advice to Young Musicians Revisited by Steven Isserlis was published by Faber & Faber. Honours He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1998, and collected his award with his father, as his mother had died earlier that week. He was awarded the 2000 Robert Schumann Prize of the City of Zwickau. Personal life His wife Pauline Mara, a flautist, died of cancer in June 2010.

It was one of the first subdivisions of Los Angeles, and is inhabited by a variety of ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Neighborhood view from Avenue 64, 2017 From Monte Vista to the 110 freeway, 2018 History The area was settled thousands of years ago by Paleo-Indians, and would later be settled by the Tongva. After the founding of Los Angeles in 1784, the Corporal of the Guard at the San Gabriel mission, Jose Maria Verdugo, was granted the 36,403 acre Rancho San Rafael which included the present day Highland Park. Drought in the late 1800s resulted in economic hardship for the Verdugo family, and Rancho San Rafael was eventually auctioned off in 1869 for $3,500 over an unpaid loan. The San Rafael tract was purchased by Andrew Glassell and Albert J. Chapman, who leased it out to sheep herders. In 1885 during the 1880s land boom, it was sold to George Morgan and Albert Judson, who combined it with other parcels they had purchased from the Verdugo family to create the Highland Park tract in 1886. Two rail lines were built to Highland Park, which helped the town to survive as the 1880s land boom ended. Highland Park was annexed to Los Angeles in 1895. In the early 20th century, Highland Park and neighboring Pasadena became havens for artists and intellectuals who led the Arts and Crafts movement. Temple Beth Israel of Highland Park and Eagle Rock was founded in Highland Park in 1923 and constructed its building in 1930. It is the second oldest synagogue in Los Angeles still operating in its original location, after the Wilshire Boulevard Temple (built in 1929). With the completion of Arroyo Seco Parkway in 1940, Highland Park began to change. By the 1950s, the artsy enclave experienced white flight, losing residents to the Mid-Wilshire district and newer neighborhoods in Temple City and in the San Fernando Valley. By the mid-1960s, it was becoming a largely Latino enclave. Mexican immigrants and their American-born children began owning and renting in Highland Park, with its schools and parks becoming places where residents debated over how to fight discrimination and advance civil rights. In the final decades of the 20th century, Highland Park suffered waves of gang violence, as a consequence of the Avenues street gang claiming the adjacent Glassell Park neighborhood and parts of Highland Park as its turf. At the dawn of the 21st century, the city attorney intensified efforts to rid Highland Park and Glassell Park of the Avenues. In 2006, four members of the gang were convicted of violating federal hate crime laws. In June 2009, police launched a major raid against the gang, rooting out many leaders of the gang with a federal racketeering indictment. By 2009, the city demolished the gang's Glassell Park stronghold. Law enforcement, coupled with community awareness efforts such as the annual Peace in the Northeast March, have led to a drastic decrease in violent crime in the 2010s. Starting in the early 2000s, a diverse mix of people began arriving to Highland Park to seek out, buy, and revitalize Craftsman homes, some which had suffered neglect over the decades. Many of Highland Park's oldest homes were razed during the 1950s and 1960s. One architecturally significant home made its way to Heritage Square Museum, thanks to the efforts of local activists dedicated to saving Victorian homes scheduled for demolition. Like Echo Park and Eagle Rock, Highland Park has steadily experienced gentrification. People from across the region have been attracted to the historic Craftsman homes that escaped demolition. Its relatively low rents have made it increasingly popular among young people who value the walkable urban lifestyle afforded by the older style of neighborhood. Once again, Highland Park is building a reputation as a mecca for artists with trendy shops, galleries, bars and restaurants opening throughout the neighborhood, and even tech startups. The statue Chicken Boy was relocated from a downtown Los Angeles restaurant in 2007. A number of shops selling vintage clothes and boutiques offering hip home-decor accessories have opened along York Boulevard. Highland Park is home to a recording studio and pop-up space for Los Angeles-based hip-hop label, Stones Throw Records. The neighborhood's low business costs, close proximity to downtown Los Angeles, and general vibe has begun to attract tech startups. Geography Highland Park is a hilly neighborhood in the city of Los Angeles, located in the San Rafael Hills and along the Arroyo Seco. It is situated within what was once Rancho San Rafael of the Mexican era. Its boundaries are roughly the Arroyo Seco Parkway (California Route 110) on the southeast, the city limits of Pasadena on the northeast, Oak Grove Drive on the north, and Avenue 51 on the west. Primary thoroughfares include York Boulevard and Figueroa Street. Highland Park sits within the Northeast Los Angeles (NELA) region of LA along with Mount Washington, Cypress Park, Glassell Park and Eagle Rock. Demographics The 2000 U.S. census counted 56,566 residents in the 3,42-square-mile neighborhood‚Äîan average of 16,835 people per square mile, one of the highest densities in Los Angeles. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 60,841. The median age for residents was 28, considered young when compared to the city at large. Highland Park was considered moderately diverse ethnically. The breakdown was Latinos, 72.4%; Asians, 11.2%; blacks, 2.4%, Non-Hispanic whites, 11.3%; and others, 2.6%. Mexico (55.3%) and El Salvador (12.0%) were the most common places of birth for the 57.8% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high compared to the city as a whole. The median household income in 2008 dollars was $45,478, about average for Los Angeles, and a high percentage of households earned $40,000 or less. The average household size of 3.3 people was high for the city of Los Angeles. Renters occupied 60.9% of the housing units, and house- or apartment owners the rest. The percentage of never-married men was among the county's highest. The 2000 census found 2,705 families headed by single parents, a high rate for both the city and the county. There were 1,942 military veterans in 2000, or 4.9%, a low figure for Los Angeles. Economy Highland Park has a legacy of local businesses, some that have been a staple in the Highland Park community for over 20 years. The first of such businesses is Galco's Soda Pop Stop. Galco's has been family owned and operated for more than 100 years. Another cultural landmark in Highland Park is Avenue 50 Studio, a nonprofit community-based organization grounded in Latino and Chicano culture.

Gliomas comprise about 30 percent of all brain tumors and central nervous system tumours, and 80 percent of all malignant brain tumours. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of gliomas depend on which part of the central nervous system is affected. A brain glioma can cause headaches, vomiting, seizures, and cranial nerve disorders as a result of increased intracranial pressure. A glioma of the optic nerve can cause visual loss. Spinal cord gliomas can cause pain, weakness, or numbness in the extremities. Gliomas do not usually metastasize by the bloodstream, but they can spread via the cerebrospinal fluid and cause \\"drop metastases\\" to the spinal cord. Complex visual hallucinations have been described as a symptom of low-grade glioma. A child who has a subacute disorder of the central nervous system that produces cranial nerve abnormalities (especially of cranial nerve VII and the lower bulbar nerves), long-tract signs, unsteady gait secondary to spasticity, and some behavioral changes is most likely to have a pontine glioma.PRETEST pediatrics p. 224 Causes   Hereditary disorders  The exact causes of gliomas are not known. Hereditary disorders such as neurofibromatoses (type 1 and type 2) and tuberous sclerosis complex are known to predispose to their development. Different oncogenes can cooperate in the development of gliomas.  Diet  Some studies of diet and vitamin supplementation seem to indicate that dietary N-nitroso compounds might influence the risk of both childhood and adult brain tumors. Researchers have observed in some studies that brain tumor patients (or their mothers) have generally consumed more cured foods (also known as Curing) than control groups. Recently, Drs. Lee, Wrensch and others found that adults with glioma were more likely to consume diets high in cured foods and low in vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables, and to consume diets high in nitrites and low in vitamin C. The effect was more pronounced in men than women. However, the pattern of increased risk with increased consumption of cured foods, and decreased risk with greater consumption of fruits, vegetables, and antioxidant vitamins is compatible with other cancer studies that show increased consumption of vegetables and possibly of fruits is associated with decreased cancer risk.http://www.kallansklan.org/uploads/FactSheet-WhoGetsBTsv_20rev.pdf  Radiation  A link between gliomas and electromagnetic radiation from cell phones has not been conclusively proven. It was considered possible, though several large studies have found no conclusive evidence, as summarized by the NIH's National Cancer Institute review of the topic and its numerous citations, and the FCC. However, further research is still being pursued to obtain more robust evidence and verify that there is no relationship (the NIH's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences most recent press release discussed an ongoing study showing mildly positive results, although it appears there may have been issues with the control group dying prematurely).  Infection with cytomegalovirus  Most glioblastomas are infected with cytomegalovirus, which speeds the development of tumors.  Other causes  Though some studies have shown that farmers have higher rates of gliomas compared to the general population, exposure to farm animals or manure is not associated with glioma. Later studies have not found an association between farming and gliomas; similar conflicting data concerns teachers and glioma. More consistent data show that architects, surveyors, retail workers, butchers, and engineers have higher rates of gliomas. Most studies have found that pesticide exposure is probably not a cause of glioma, though a minority of studies have found an association.  Inherited polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes  Germ-line (inherited) polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes ERCC1, ERCC2 (XPD) and XRCC1 increase the risk of glioma. This indicates that altered or deficient repair of DNA damage contributes to the formation of gliomas. DNA damages are a likely major primary cause of progression to cancer in general. Excess DNA damages can give rise to mutations through translesion synthesis. Furthermore, incomplete DNA repair can give rise to epigenetic alterations or epimutations. Such mutations and epimutations may provide a cell with a proliferative advantage which can then, by a process of natural selection, lead to progression to cancer. Epigenetic repression of DNA repair genes is often found in progression to sporadic glioblastoma. For instance, methylation of the DNA repair gene MGMT promoter was observed in 51% to 66% of glioblastoma specimens. In addition, in some glioblastomas, the MGMT protein is deficient due to another type of epigenetic alteration. MGMT protein expression may also be reduced due to increased levels of a microRNA that inhibits the ability of the MGMT messenger RNA to produce the MGMT protein. Zhang et al. found, in the glioblastomas without methylated MGMT promoters, that the level of microRNA miR-181d is inversely correlated with protein expression of MGMT and that the direct target of miR-181d is the MGMT mRNA 3'UTR (the three prime untranslated region of MGMT messenger RNA). Epigenetic reductions in expression of another DNA repair protein, ERCC1, were found in an assortment of 32 gliomas. For 17 of the 32 (53%) of the gliomas tested, ERCC1 protein expression was reduced or absent. In the case of 12 gliomas (37.5%) this reduction was due to methylation of the ERCC1 promoter. For the other 5 gliomas with reduced ERCC1 protein expression, the reduction could have been due to epigenetic alterations in microRNAs that affect ERCC1 expression. When expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, DNA damages accumulate in cells at a higher than normal level, and such excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation. Mutations in gliomas frequently occur in either isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 genes. One of these mutations (mostly in IDH1) occurs in about 80% of low grade gliomas and secondary high-grade gliomas. Wang et al. pointed out that IDH1 and IDH2 mutant cells produce an excess metabolic intermediate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, which binds to catalytic sites in key enzymes that are important in altering histone and DNA promoter methylation. Thus, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 generate a \\"DNA CpG island methylator phenotype or CIMP\\" that causes promoter hypermethylation and concomitant silencing of tumor suppressor genes such as DNA repair genes MGMT and ERCC1. On the other hand, Cohen et al. and Molenaar et al. pointed out that mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 can cause increased oxidative stress. Increased oxidative damage to DNA could be mutagenic. This is supported by an increased number of DNA double-strand breaks in IDH1-mutated glioma cells. Thus, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations act as driver mutations in glioma carcinogenesis, though it is not clear by which role they are primarily acting. A study, involving 51 patients with brain gliomas who had two or more biopsies over time, showed that mutation in the IDH1 gene occurred prior to the occurrence of a p53 mutation or a 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity, indicating that an IDH1 mutation is an early driver mutation. Pathophysiology High-grade gliomas are highly vascular tumors and have a tendency to infiltrate diffusely. They have extensive areas of necrosis and hypoxia. Often, tumor growth causes a breakdown of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier in the vicinity of the tumor. As a rule, high-grade gliomas almost always grow back even after complete surgical excision, so are commonly called recurrent cancer of the brain. Conversely, low-grade gliomas grow slowly, often over many years, and can be followed without treatment unless they grow and cause symptoms. Several acquired (not inherited) genetic mutations have been found in gliomas. Tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) is mutated early in the disease. p53 is the \\"guardian of the genome\\", which, during DNA and cell duplication, makes sure the DNA is copied correctly and destroys the cell (apoptosis) if the DNA is mutated and cannot be fixed. When p53 itself is mutated, other mutations can survive. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), another tumor suppressor gene, is itself lost or mutated. Epidermal growth factor receptor, a growth factor that normally stimulates cells to divide, is amplified and stimulates cells to divide too much. Together, these mutations lead to cells dividing uncontrollably, a hallmark of cancer. In 2009, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 were found to be part of the mechanism and associated with a less favorable prognosis. Diagnosis Classification Gliomas are classified by cell type, by grade, and by location. =By type of cell= Gliomas are named according to the specific type of cell with which they share histological features, but not necessarily from which they originate. The main types of gliomas are: * Ependymomas: ependymal cells * Astrocytomas: astrocytes (glioblastoma multiforme is a malignant astrocytoma and the most common primary brain tumor among adults). * Oligodendrogliomas: oligodendrocytes * Brainstem glioma: develop in the brain stem * Optic nerve glioma: develop in or around the optic nerve * Mixed gliomas, such as oligoastrocytomas, contain cells from different types of glia =By grade= Gliomas are further categorized according to their grade, which is determined by pathologic evaluation of the tumor. The neuropathological evaluation and diagnostics of brain tumor specimens is performed according to WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System. Low-grade brain glioma in a 28-year-old male. (Taken on 10 July 2007) * Biologically benign gliomas [WHO grade I] are comparatively low risk and can be removed surgically depending on their location * Low-grade gliomas [WHO grade II] are well-differentiated (not anaplastic); these tend to exhibit benign tendencies and portend a better prognosis for the patient. However, they have a uniform rate of recurrence and increase in grade over time so should be classified as malignant. * High-grade [WHO grades III‚ÄìIV] gliomas are undifferentiated or anaplastic; these are malignant and carry a worse prognosis. Of numerous grading systems in use, the most common is the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for astrocytoma, under which tumors are graded from I (least advanced disease‚Äîbest prognosis) to IV (most advanced disease‚Äîworst prognosis). =By location= Gliomas can be classified according to whether they are above or below a membrane in the brain called the tentorium. The tentorium separates the cerebrum (above) from the cerebellum (below). *The supratentorial is above the tentorium, in the cerebrum, and mostly found in adults (70%). *The infratentorial is below the tentorium, in the cerebellum, and mostly found in children (70%). *The pontine tumors are located in the pons of the brainstem. The brainstem has three parts (pons, midbrain, and medulla); the pons controls critical functions such as breathing, making surgery on these extremely dangerous. Treatment Treatment for brain gliomas depends on the location, the cell type, and the grade of malignancy. Often, treatment is a combined approach, using surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The radiation therapy is in the form of external beam radiation or the stereotactic approach using radiosurgery. Spinal cord tumors can be treated by surgery and radiation. Temozolomide is a chemotherapy drug which can be administered easily in an outpatient setting and is able to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier effectively. Treatment via immunotherapy may help some gliomas. Refractory disease For recurrent high-grade glioblastoma, recent studies have taken advantage of angiogenic blockers such as bevacizumab in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with encouraging results. Relative effectiveness A 2017 meta-analysis compared surgical resection versus biopsy as the initial surgical management option for a person with a low-grade glioma. Results show the evidence is insufficient to make a reliable decision. The relative effectiveness of surgical resection compared to biopsy for people with malignant glioma (high- grade) is unknown. For high-grade gliomas, a 2003 meta-analysis compared radiotherapy with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It showed a small but clear improvement from using chemotherapy with radiotherapy. A 2019 meta-analysis suggested that for people with less aggressive gliomas, radiotherapy may increase the risk of long term neurocognitive side effects. Whilst, evidence is uncertain on whether there are long term neurocognitive side effects associated with chemoradiotherapy. Temozolomide is effective for treating Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) compared to radiotherapy alone. A 2013 meta- analysis showed that Temozolomide prolongs survival and delays progression, but is associated with an increase in side effects such as blood complications, fatigue, and infection. For people with recurrent GBM, when comparing temozolomide with chemotherapy, there may be an improvement in the time-to-progression and the person's quality of life, but no improvement in overall survival, with temozolomide treatment. Evidence suggests that for people with recurrent high-grade gliomas who have not had chemotherapy before, there are similar survival and time-to-progression outcomes between treatment with temozolomide or the chemotherapy multidrug known as PCV (procarvazine, lomustine and vincristine). A mutational analysis of 23 initial low-grade gliomas and recurrent tumors from the same patients has challenged the benefits and usage of Temozolomide. The study showed that when lower-grade brain tumors of patients are removed and patients are further treated with Temozolomide, 6 out of 10 times the recurrent tumors were more aggressive and acquired alternative and more mutations. As one of the last authors, Costello, stated \\"They had a 20- to 50-fold increase in the number of mutations. A patient who received surgery alone who might have had 50 mutations in the initial tumor and 60 in the recurrence. But patients who received TMZ might have 2,000 mutations in the recurrence.\\" Further, new mutations were verified to carry known signatures of Temozolomide induced mutations. The research suggests that Temozolomide for the treatment of certain brain tumors should be thoroughly thought. Unjudicious usage of Temozolomide might lower the prognosis of the patients further, or increase their burden. Further understanding of the mechanisms of Temozolomide induced mutations and novel combination approaches could be promising. Prognosis Prognosis of gliomas is given in relation to what grade (as scored by the World Health Organization system) of tumour the patient presents with. Typically, any tumour presenting as above WHO grade I (i.e. a malignant tumour as opposed to a benign tumour) will have a prognosis resulting in eventual death, varying from years (WHO grade II/III) to months (WHO grade IV). Prognosis can also be given based on cellular subtype, which may also impact prognosis. Low grade For low- grade tumors, the prognosis is somewhat more optimistic. Patients diagnosed with a low-grade glioma are 17 times as likely to die as matched patients in the general population. The age-standardized 10-year relative survival rate was 47%. One study reported that low-grade oligodendroglioma patients have a median survival of 11.6 years; another reported a median survival of 16.7 years. Unfortunately, approximately 70% of low-grade (WHO grade-II) will progress to high-grade tumours within 5‚Äì10 years High grade This group comprises anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme. Whereas the median overall survival of anaplastic (WHO grade III) gliomas is approximately 3 years, glioblastoma multiforme has a poor median overall survival of c. 15 months. Postoperative conventional daily radiotherapy improves survival for adults with good functional well‚Äêbeing and high grade glioma compared to no postoperative radiotherapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy has similar efficacy for survival as compared to conventional radiotherapy, particularly for individuals aged 60 and older with glioblastoma. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma primarily affects children, usually between the ages of 5 and 7. The median survival time with DIPG is under 12 months. Surgery to attempt tumour removal is usually not possible or advisable for DIPG. By their very nature, these tumours invade diffusely throughout the brain stem, growing between normal nerve cells. Aggressive surgery would cause severe damage to neural structures vital for arm and leg movement, eye movement, swallowing, breathing, and even consciousness. Trials of drug candidates have been unsuccessful. The disease is primarily treated with radiation therapy alone.  IDH1 and IDH2-mutated glioma  Patients with glioma carrying mutations in either IDH1 or IDH2 have a relatively favorable survival, compared with patients with glioma with wild-type IDH1/2 genes. In WHO grade III glioma, IDH1/2-mutated glioma have a median prognosis of ~3.5 years, whereas IDH1/2 wild-type glioma perform poor with a median overall survival of c. 1.5 years. In glioblastoma, the difference is larger. There, IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastoma have a median overall survival of 1 year, whereas IDH1/2-mutated glioblastoma have a median overall survival of more than 3 years.

Map of usage of Filipino languages Philippine literature is literature associated with the Philippines from prehistory, through its colonial legacies, and on to the present. Pre-Hispanic Philippine literature was actually epics passed on from generation to generation, originally through an oral tradition. However, wealthy families, especially in Mindanao, were able to keep transcribed copies of these epics as family heirloom. One such was the Darangen, an epic of the Maranaos. Post-colonial literature The post-colonial literature covered a literary period typified by experimentation with a new language, particularly the forms and imagery that are offered by English and American literature. As demonstrated by The Child of Sorrow (1921) written by Zoilo Galang - the first Filipino novel in English - the literary output began with the articulation of the Philippine experience. The early writings in English were characterized by melodrama, unreal language, and unsubtle emphasis on local color. The literary content later imbibed themes that express the search for Filipino identity, reconciling the centuries-old Spanish and American influence to the Philippines' Asian heritage. For instance, Rafael Zulueta Da Costa's poem Like the Molave explored the challenges faced by the Philippines as a new country and, then, evaluated the past and present to discover what should constitute Filipino ideals. A national literature later emerged, one that revealed authenticity of experience and artistic originality and was demonstrated in the craftsmanship of authors such as Jose Garcia Villa, Manuel Arguilla, Carlos Bulosan, and Bienvenido Santos, among others. Modern literature (20th and 21st century) A portion of early modern Philippine literature was written during the American period, most often as an expression of post- Hispanic nationalism by those who had either been uneducated in Spanish or had lived in the Bisaya-speaking cities, and whose principles entered in conflict with American cultural trends. Such period of Spanish literary production‚Äîi.e., between the independence of Oroquieta City in 1898 and well ahead into the decade of the 1900s‚Äîis known as Edad de Oro del Castellano en Filipinas. Some prominent writers of this era were Claro Recto in essay; Antonio Abad and Guillermo G√≥mez Windham, in the narrative; and Fernando Mar√≠a Guerrero and Manuel Bernab√©, both in poetry. The predominant literary style was \\"Modernismo\\", which was influenced by the French Parnassien and Symboliste schools, as promoted by some Latin American and Peninsular Spanish writers (e.g. the Nicaraguan Rub√©n Dar√≠o, the Mexican Amado Nervo, the Spaniard Francisco Villaespesa, and the Peruvian Jos√© Santos Chocano as major models). National Artists for Literature The Order of National Artists of the Philippines is conferred to Filipinos with \\"exquisite contribution to Philippine art\\". The artists are chosen by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (Philippines) and the Cultural Center of the Philippines. The Order is given by the President of the Philippines.

Housing tens of thousands of statues of Shakyamuni Buddha and his disciples, they are located south of present-day Luoyang in Henan province, China. The images, many once painted, were carved as outside rock reliefs and inside artificial caves excavated from the limestone cliffs of the Xiangshan () and Longmenshan, running east and west. The Yi River () flows northward between them and the area used to be called Yique (). The alternative name of \\"Dragon's Gate Grottoes\\" derives from the resemblance of the two hills that check the flow of the Yi River to the typical \\"Chinese gate towers\\" that once marked the entrance to Luoyang from the south. There are as many as 100,000 statues within the 2,345 caves, ranging from to in height. The area also contains nearly 2,500 stelae and inscriptions, hence the name ‚ÄúForest of Ancient Stelae\\", as well as over sixty Buddhist pagodas. Situated in a scenic natural environment, the caves were dug from a stretch of cliff running along both banks of the river. 30% date from the Northern Wei and 60% from the Tang dynasty, caves from other periods accounting for less than 10% of the total. Starting with the Northern Wei Dynasty in 493 AD, patrons and donors included emperors, Wu Zetian, members of the royal family, other rich families, generals, and religious groups. In 2000 the site was inscribed upon the UNESCO World Heritage List as ‚Äúan outstanding manifestation of human artistic creativity,‚Äù for its perfection of an art form, and for its encapsulation of the cultural sophistication of Tang China.  Geography  Mt. Longmen as seen from Manshui Bridge to the southeast. May, 2004. View of the West Hill Grottoes from the east bank of the Yi River. This complex is one of the three notable grottoes in China. The other two grottoes are the Yungang Caves near Datong in Shanxi Province, and the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang in Gansu Province. The valley formed by the Yi River enclosed by two hills ranges of Xiangshan (to the east) and Longmenshan (to the west) hills have steep slopes on the western and eastern slopes along the river. Yi is a north flowing tributary of the Luo River. The grottoes are formed in 1 km of the stretch of this river and were carved on both banks, in limestone formations creating the Longmen Caves. Most of the work was done on the western bank, while the eastern bank caves, of smaller numbers, served as residences for the large groups of monks. Within the approximately 1,400 caves, there are 100,000 statues, some of which are only high, while the largest Buddha statue is in height. There are also approximately 2500 stelae and 60 pagodas. The grottoes are located on both sides of the Yi River. Fifty large and medium-sized caves are seen on the west hill cliffs which are credited to the Northern, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, while the caves on the east hill were carved entirely during the Tang Dynasty. The plethora of caves, sculptures and pagodas in Longmen Grottoes depict a definite \\"progression in style\\" with the early caves being simple and well shaped with carvings of statues of Buddha and religious people. The change of style is more distinct in the Tang Dynastic periods which are ‚Äúmore complex and incorporate women and court figures as well‚Äù. The caves have been numbered sequentially from north to south along the west bank of the Yi River. Entry to the caves is from the northern end.  History   Early history  The earliest history of the creation of Longmen Grottoes is traced to the reign of Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei dynasty when he shifted his capital to Luoyang from D√†t√≥ng; Luoyang's symbolic value is borne by the fact that it served as the historic capital for 13 dynasties. The grottoes were excavated and carved with Buddhist subjects over the period from 493 AD to 1127 AD, in four distinct phases. The first phase started with the Northern Wei dynasty (493‚Äì534). The second phase saw slow development of caves as there was interruption due to strife in the region, between 524 and 626, during the reign of the Sui dynasty (581‚Äì618) and the early part of the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907). The third phase, was during the reign of the Tang dynasty when Chinese Buddhism flourished and there was a proliferation of caves and carvings from 626 to the mid 8th century. The last phase, which was the fourth, was from the later part of the Tang dynastic rule extending to the Northern Song Dynasty rule, which saw a decline in the creation of grottoes. It came to an end due to internecine war between the Jin and Yuan dynasties. Guyangdong or the Shiku Temple, credited to Emperor Xiaowen, was the first cave temple to be built at the center of the southern floor of the West Hill. Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei followed up this activity and excavated three more caves, two in memory of his father, Emperor Xiaowen, and one in memory of his mother; all three caves are grouped under the title of the \\"Three Binyang Caves\\" (Binyangsandong), which were built by the emperor over a 24-year period. Over 30% of the caves seen now were built during this period. In 527, the Huangfugong or Shikusi grottoes, a major cave, was completed. It is a well conserved cave located to the south of the West Hill. In 675, Fengxiansi Cave, on the southern floor of the West Hill was completed during the Tang dynasty rule. This marked the third phase of creation and the peak period of the gottoes' creation. It is estimated that 60% of the caves seen at Longmen came about in this period from 626 till 755. During this period, in addition to the caves which housed Buddha statues of various sizes, some Buddhist temples were also built in open spaces with scenic settings in the same complex. However, these are now mostly in ruins. During this phase, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu Zetian were instrumental in intensifying the activity when they were ruling from Luyong. Entrance to Longmen Grottoes (Longmen Shiku) under Longmen Bridge over Yi River (Yi He)  Later history  During the period of 1368 to 1912, when two dynasties ruled in China, namely the Ming dynasty from 1368 to 1644, and the Qing dynasty from 1644 to 1912, there was cultural revival and the Longmen Grottoes received recognition both at the national and international level. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese looted the site and took many of the statues back to Japan. Many of these relics are now in Japanese museums. Vandalism occurred in the 1940s, a result of political unrest. With the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, the grottoes have been declared as protected area and are being conserved. The Constitution of China, under Article 22, which among other issues also provides for protection of the natural heritage sites, has been further defined under various legal instruments enacted to protect and conserve this cultural heritage of China. The Longmen Relics Care Agency was established in 1953 under the Ministry of Culture. A 1954 site inventory was undertaken by the newly established Longmen Caves Cultural Relics Management and Conservation Office. The State Council declared the Longmen Grottoes as a national cultural monument needing special protection in 1961. In 1982, it was declared as one of the first group of scenic zones to be protected at the state level. The Management and Conservation Office was renamed the Longmen Grottoes Research Institute in 1990; and the People‚Äôs Government of Luoyang City became responsible for the management of the heritage monuments. The governing organization was renamed the Longmen Grottoes Research Academy in 2002.McNair, p. 2 During the Warring States period, the general Bai Qi of Qin once defeated the allied forces of Han and Wei at the site. The site was subjected to significant vandalism at several points in its history. Major artifacts were removed by Western collectors and souvenir hunters during the early 20th century. The heads of many statues were also destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Two murals taken from the grottoes are reported to be displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri.  Panorama   Grottoes  Massive Buddhist sculptures in the main grotto. There are several major grottoes with notable displays of Buddhist sculptures and calligraphic inscriptions. Some of the main caves and the year when work began within them include: Guyang-dong (493), Binyang-dong (505), Lianhua-dong (520s), Weizi-dong (522), Shiku-si (520s), Weizi-dong (520s), Shisku (520s), Yaofang-dong (570), Zhaifu-dong (ca. 636), Huijian-dong (630s), Fahua-dong (650s), Fengxian-si (672), Wanfo-si (670-680s), Jinan-dong (684), Ganjing-si (684), and Leigutai-dong (684). The Guyang, Binyang, and Lianhua caves are horseshoe-shaped.  Guyangdong  Guyangdong, or Guyang Cave, or Old Sun Cave, is recorded as the oldest Longmen cave with carvings in the Northern Wei style. It is also the largest cave, located in the central part of the west hill. It was carved under the orders of Emperor Xiaowen. The earliest carving in this limestone cave has been now dated at 478 AD, during the period when Emperor Xiaowen is thought to have been moving his capital from Datong to Luoyang. The Buddhist statues in the niches of this cave are very well sculpted. Also found here are 600 inscriptions in fine calligraphy of writings in the Northern Wei style. Many of the sculptures inside the cave were contributed by royalty; religious groups supported this activity. The cave has three very large images ‚Äì the central image is of Sakyamuni Buddha with Bodhisattvas on either side. The features of the images are indicative of the Northern Wei style, typically of slim and emaciated figures. There are about 800 inscriptions on the walls and in the niches inside the cave, the most in any cave in China. There are two rows of niches on the northern and southern walls of the cave, which house a very large number of images; the artists have recorded their names, the dates, and the reasons for carving them.  Binyang  Binyang has three caves, North Binyang Cave, Middle Binyang Cave and South Binyang Cave, of which the Middle Binyang Cave is the most prominent. ;Binyangzhongdong Binyangzhongdong () or the Middle Binyang Cave, is carved in the Datang style on the west hill, on the northern floor. It was built by Emperor Xuanwun to commemorate his father Xiaowen, and also his mother. It is said that 800,000 workers created it over the period from 500 to 523. In the main wall of this cave, five very large Buddhist statues are carved all in Northern Wei style The central statue is of Sakyamuni Buddha with four images of Bodhisattvas flanking it. Two side walls also have Buddha images flanked by Bodhisattva. The Buddhas, arranged in three groups in the cave, are representative of Buddhas of the past, the present, and the future. The canopy in the roof is designed as a lotus flower. There were two large bas-reliefs of imperial processions, that included Emperor Xiaowen, Empress Dowager Wenzhao, and the emperor's late parents in worship. The reliefs were stolen completely in the mid-1930s. The emperor's procession is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and two thirds of the empress's is in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. While a few statues are sculpted with \\"long features, thin faces, fishtail robes and traces of Greek influence\\", others are in Tang period natural style and heavily built. ;Binyangnandong Binyangnandong (), or the South Binyang Cave, has five very large images which were carved by Li Tai, the fourth son of Emperor Taizong of Tang, the first Tang Emperor. He made them in 641 AD in memory of his mother Empress Zhangsun. The central image in a serene appearance is that of Amitabha Buddha seated on a pedestal surrounded by Bodhisattvas, also serene looking in a blend of the Northern Wei and the Tang Dynasty styles.  Fengxian  The Big Vairocana of Longmen Buddha Grottoes Fengxian, or Feng Xian Si (), or Li Zhi cave is the Ancestor Worshipping Cave, which is the largest of all caves carved on the west hill built between 672 and 676 for Empress Wu Zetian. The carvings are claimed to be the ultimate in architectural perfection of the Tang dynasty. The shrine inside the cave measures 39 m x35m. It has the largest Buddha statue at the Longmen Grottoes. Of the nine huge carved statues, the highly impressive image of Vairocana Buddha is sculpted on the back wall of the Fengxian. The image is 17.14m high and has 2 m long ears. An inscription at the base of this figure gives 676 as the year of carving. The Bodhisattva on the left of the main image of Buddha is decorated with a crown and pearls. Also shown is a divine person trampling an evil spirit. The main Vairocana image's features are plumpish and of peaceful and natural expression. Each of the other large statues are carved with expressions matching their representative roles. These were carved at the orders of Empress Wu Zetian, and are considered uniquely representative of the Tang dynasty's \\"vigorous, elegant and realistic style.\\" The huge Vairocana statue is considered as \\"the quintessence of Buddhist sculpture in China.\\" The Vairocana statue also provides at its base the names of the artisans who worked here, the name of the Emperor Gaozong, who was the donor, and also honors Wu Zetian. It is said that Wu Zetian donated \\"twenty-thousand strings of her rouge and powder money\\" to complete this edifice. Hence, it is conjectured that the Vairocana Buddha was carved to resemble the Empress herself and termed a \\"Chinese Mona Lisa, Venus or as the Mother of China\\". All the images here, which remain undamaged, project character and animation. Statues of Kasyapa and Ananda, the two principal disciples of Vairocana, and of two Bodhisattvas with crowns flank the main statue, in addition to numerous images of \\"lokapalas (guardians or heavenly kings), dvarapalas (temple guards), flying devas and numerous other figures.\\"  Others  ;Huangfugong Huangfugong, or Shikusi, a three-wall, three-niche cave, is situated south of the west hill, was carved out in 527. It was completed at one stretch as a single unit and is very well preserved. There are seven Buddhas carved on the lintel which give the appearance of a wood finish. Seven very large images are seen in the main hall with the Buddha image flanked by two Bodhisattvas and two disciples. Also seen are images of Buddhist groups in the niches of the cave. A very large design of a lotus flower is carved in the roof, flanked by eight musical apsaras (water spirits or nymphs). It was created by Huangfu Du, uncle of Empress Hu. ;Wan-fo-dung Wan-fo-dung (\\"Cave of Ten Thousand Buddhas\\"‰∏á‰ΩõÊ¥û), or Yung-lung-tung, was built in 680 by Gaozong and Wu Zetian. It houses 15,000 Buddhas carved in small niches, different from each other, with the smallest Buddha being in height. ;Yaofangdong Yaofangdong (), or the Medical Prescription Cave, has small inscriptions of 140 medical prescriptions for a wide range of medical problems from the common cold to insanity. These are seen carved right at the entrance on both walls. These carvings are dated from the late Northern Wei period to the early Tang Dynasty. ;Qianxisi Detail of Vairocana Reached by modern, concrete stairs up the face of a cliff, Qianxisi, or Hidden Stream Temple Cave, is a large cave on the northern edge of the west hill. Made during Gaozong's reign (653‚Äì80), the cave has a statue of a huge, seated, early Tang Buddha (Amitabha Buddha), flanked by statues of the Bodhisattvas Avalokitesvara and Mahasthamaprapta. The statues are carved with a sophisticated expression typical of Tang style. It may have been sponsored by the Nanping princess, with the beneficiary being Gaozong, her recently deceased father. ;Lianhua The Lianhua or the Lotus Flower Cave (), dated to 527, belongs to the Northern Wei period. The Grotto has a large lotus flower carved in high relief on its ceiling. Several small Buddhas are carved into the south wall. Also seen are shrines in the south and north wall in the niches. ;Laolong The Laolong or the Old Dragon Cave () created during the Tang Dynasty period, named after the Old Dragon Palace, has many niches dated to Gaozong‚Äôs reign.  Temples  Xiangshan Temple There are the several temples at Longmen Grottoes. Some important ones include Xiangshan Temple, Bai Garden temple, and the Tomb of Bai Juyi. Others are Tongle temple, begun under Emperor Mingyuan; Lingyan and Huguo temples, under Emperor Wencheng; Tiangong temple, under Xiaowen; and Chongfu temple, under Qianer.  Xiangshan Temple  Xiangshan Temple is one of the earliest of the ten temples at Longmen. It is located in the midsection of the east hill. The name 'Xiangshan' is derived from the name of the spices \\"Xiangge\\" found extensively on these hill slopes. It was reconstructed some time in 1707, during the reign of the Qing Dynasty, patterned on an old temple that existed there. Longmen Grottoes Administration, expanded the temple in 2002, by adding the \\"Belfry, the Drum Tower, the Wing Room, the Hall of Mahavira and Hall of Nine Persons, Eighteen Arhats, the Villa of Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling\\". New additions included board walks, compound wall and a new gate from the southern end of the temple.  Bai Garden temple  Tomb of Bai Juyi Bai Garden is temple situated on the Pipa peak, to the north of the east hill (Xiangshan Hill). It was re-built in 1709 by Tang Youzeng of the Qing Dynasty. The temple is surrounded by thick vegetation of pine and cypress trees.  Tomb of Bai Juyi  The Tomb of Bai Juyi on the east bank is that of the well-known poet during the Tang Dynasty who lived in Luoyang during his later years. The tomb is located on the hill top. It is approached from the west bank after crossing a bridge across the Yi River. The tomb is a circular mound of earth of 4 meters height with a circumference of 52 meters. The tomb is 2.80 meters high and has the poet's name inscribed on it as Bai Juyi.  Preservation and restoration  Delamination of the limestone from which the figures are carved One of the major achievements in this direction is the recognition given to the monuments by UNESCO in declaring the Longmen Grottoes a heritage monument, after due evaluation over a period, and inscribing it in the World Heritage List. The recognition is based on Criteria (i), (ii), and (iii): \\"Criterion (i), the sculptures of the Longmen Grottoes are an outstanding manifestation of human artistic creativity; Criterion (ii) the Longmen Grottoes illustrate the perfection of a long-established art form which was to play a highly significant role in the cultural evolution of this region of Asia; and Criterion (iii), the high cultural level and sophisticated society of Tang Dynasty China is encapsulated in the exceptional stone carvings of the Longmen Grottoes.\\" This also enjoins the Government of China to take adequate steps to preserve the monument in its heritage status according to guidelines issued from time to time after frequent inspections of the site. The Longmen Grottoes have undergone many concerted efforts of identifying, demarcating, planning, and implementing restoration works since 1951. To start with, a weather monitoring station was established near the grottoes to assess the environmental conditions prevailing in the area and to plan appropriate restoration measures. This was followed by intensive restoration works, initially in the form of strengthening the rock bases to arrest seepage of water from the roofs and sides of the grottoes. Overgrown vegetation with roots was cleared. Means of access to the caves were newly installed in the form of railings, footpaths and walkways with steps. All the efforts taken by the government of China over the last nearly six decades has ensured that the grottoes are preserved in a fairly presentable state of conservation. All this has been achieved by the integrated action of three institutions, namely: the China Institution of Cultural Relics Protection, who provided the professional scientific inputs, the China University of Geosciences, and the Longmen Cultural Relics Care Agency. Funds for the studies and restoration works have been provided for under the Revised Five-Year and Ten-Year Plans approved by the People‚Äôs Government of Luoyang City in 1999.

His father was Sir John de Sutton V and his mother was Constance Blount, daughter of Sir Walter Blount. John 1st Baron Dudley married Elizabeth de Berkeley, of Beverstone (died 1478), widow of Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton and daughter of Sir John Berkeley, of Beverstone, Gloucestershire (1349‚Äì1428) and Elizabeth BettershorneComplete Peerage Vol. 4 p. 480 and sister of Eleanor FitzAlan, wife of John FitzAlan, 6th Earl of Arundel, sometime after 14 March 1420.

Dudley was summoned to Parliament from 15 February 1440, by writs directed to \\"Johanni de Sutton de Duddeley militi\\", whereby he obtained a Barony by writ as Lord Dudley. He was the first of his family to adopt the surname of Dudley as an alias for Sutton. \\"John Dudley, Knyght, Lord Dudley\\" died testate in his 87th year. His will is dated 17 August 1487. The barony was inherited by his grandson, Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley, son of Sir Edmund Sutton who was the heir but died after 6 July 1483 but before his father. Royal service As Lord Steward in 1422 Sutton brought home the body of King Henry V to England, and was chief mourner and standard bearer at his funeral. From 1428-1430 he served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.Wilson p. 4 Dudley fought in several campaigns throughout the period of the wars with France, and on several occasions acted as a diplomat in the mid-1440s, when he also met Charles VII of France.Wolffe p. 190-195 In 1443 he was made a king's councillor and became one of the favourite companions of King Henry VI.Wolffe p. 104 In 1451 he became a Knight of the Garter. Early on in the Wars of the Roses he was a resolute defender of the House of Lancaster, but changed his allegiance to York before the Battle of Towton in 1461. Wars of the Roses At the Battle of St Albans in 1455, Lord Dudley took part with his son Edmund, where he was taken prisoner along with Henry VI. At the Battle of Blore Heath on 23 September 1459 he was again present, equally with his son Edmund Sutton, commanding a wing under Lord Audley. Dudley was wounded and again captured. At Towton (1461) he was rewarded after the battle for his participation on the side of Edward, Earl of March, son of Richard, Duke of York. On 28 June that year, Edward IV was proclaimed King in London.

Like other robots, a social robot is physically embodied (avatars or on-screen synthetic social characters are not embodied and thus distinct). Some synthetic social agents are designed with a screen to represent the head or 'face' to dynamically communicate with users. In these cases, the status as a social robot depends on the form of the 'body' of the social agent; if the body has and uses some physical motors and sensor abilities, then the system could be considered a robot. Background While robots have often been described as possessing social qualities (see for example the tortoises developed by William Grey Walter in the 1950s), social robotics is a fairly recent branch of robotics. Since the early 1990s artificial intelligence and robotics researchers have developed robots which explicitly engage on a social level. Notable researchers include Cynthia Breazeal, Tony Belpaeme, Aude Billard, Kerstin Dautenhahn, Yiannis Demiris, Hiroshi Ishiguro, Maja Mataric, Javier Movellan, Brian Scassellati and Dean Weber. Also related is the Kansai engineering movement in Japanese science and technology --- for social robotics, see especially work by Takayuki Kanda, Hideki Kozima, Hiroshi Ishiguro, Micho Okada, Tomio Watanabe, and P. Ravindra S. De Silva. Designing an autonomous social robot is particularly challenging, as the robot needs to correctly interpret people's action and respond appropriately, which is currently not yet possible. Moreover, people interacting with a social robot may hold very high expectancies of its capabilities, based on science fiction representations of advanced social robots. As such, many social robots are partially or fully remote controlled to simulate advanced capabilities. This method of (often covertly) controlling a social robot is referred to as a Mechanical Turk or Wizard of Oz, after the character in the L. Frank Baum book. Wizard of Oz studies are useful in social robotics research to evaluate how people respond to social robots. Definition A robot is defined in the International Standard of Organization as a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for performance of a variety of tasks. As a subset of robots, social robots perform any or all of these processes in the context of a social interaction. The nature of the social interactions is immaterial and may range from relatively simple supportive tasks, such as passing tools to a worker, to complex expressive communication and collaboration, such as assistive healthcare. Hence, social robots are asked to work together with humans in collaborative workspaces. Moreover, social robots start following humans into much more personal settings like home, health care, and education. Social interactions are likely to be cooperative, but the definition is not limited to this situation. Moreover, uncooperative behavior can be considered social in certain situations. The robot could, for example, exhibit competitive behavior within the framework of a game. The robot could also interact with a minimum or no communication. It could, for example, hand tools to an astronaut working on a space station. However, it is likely that some communication will be necessary at some point. Two suggested David Feil- Seifer, Kristine Skinner and Maja J. Matariƒá, \\"Benchmarks for evaluating socially assistive robotics\\", Interaction Studies: Psychological Benchmarks of Human-Robot Inteaction [sic], 8(3), 423-429 Oct, 2007 ultimate requirements for social robots are the Turing Test to determine the robot's communication skills and Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics for its behavior. The usefulness to apply these requirements in a real-world application, especially in the case of Asimov's laws, is still disputedTowards Data Science: Asimov‚Äôs Laws of Robotics, and why AI may not abide by them and may not be possible at all). However, a consequence of this viewpoint is that a robot that only interacts and communicates with other robots would not be considered to be a social robot: Being social is bound to humans and their society which defines necessary social values, norms and standards.Taipale, S., Vincent, J., Sapio, B., Lugano, G. and Fortunati, L. (2015) Introduction: Situating the Human in Social Robots. In J. Vincent et al., eds. Social Robots from a Human Perspective, Dordrecht: Springer, pp. 1-17 This results in a cultural dependency of social robots since social values, norms and standards differ between cultures. This brings us directly to the last part of the definition. A social robot must interact within the social rules attached to its role. The role and its rules are defined through society. For example, a robotic butler for humans would have to comply with established rules of good service. It should be anticipating, reliable and most of all discreet. A social robot must be aware of this and comply with it. However, social robots that interact with other autonomous robots would also behave and interact according to non-human conventions. In most social robots the complexity of human-to-human interaction will be gradually approached with the advancement of the technology of androids (a form of humanoid robots) and implementation of a variety of more human-like communication skills  Social Interaction  Researches have investigated user engagement with a robot companion. Literature present different models regarding this concern. An example is a framework that models both causes and effects of engagement: features related to the user's non-verbal behaviour, the task and the companion's affective reactions to predict children's level of engagement. Societal Impacts The increasingly widespread use of more advanced social robots is one of several phenomena expected to contribute to the technological posthumanization of human societies, through which process ‚Äúa society comes to include members other than ‚Äònatural‚Äô biological human beings who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, dynamics, or meaning of the society.‚Äù Examples One of the most well-known social robots currently in development is Sophia, developed by Hanson Robotics. Sophia is a social humanoid robot that can display more than 50 facial expressions, and is the first non-human to be given a United Nations title. SoftBank Robotics has developed multiple social, semi-humanoid robots which are frequently used in research, including Pepper and Nao. Pepper is used both commercially and academically, as well as being used by consumers in over a thousand homes in Japan. Other notable examples of social robots include ASIMO by Honda and Kaspar, designed by University of Hertfordshire to help children with autism learn responses from the robot through games and interactive play. Anki's robots Cozmo and Vector also fell into the category of hyped social robots, but all were shut down between 2018 and 2019. Social robots do not necessarily have to be humanoid. The most famous example of a non-humanoid social robot is Paro the seal.

In 1965, he was knighted for his service to organisations for the blind. He was Fellow and Tutor in Jurisprudence at Balliol College, Oxford for almost forty years. Born in Bournville, Tylor learned to play chess at age seven. His chess skill increased while he attended Worcester College for the Blind from 1909 to 1918. He studied at Oxford University beginning in 1918, and captained the Oxford University Chess Club. Tylor received First-class Honours in Jurisprudence in 1922 and was made an honorary scholar of Balliol College. The next year, he became a Bachelor of Civil Law and a lecturer at Balliol College. Called to the Bar by the Inner Temple with a certificate of honour, he was made a Fellow at Balliol College in 1928. Tylor competed in twelve British Championships, finishing fourth in his first appearance in 1925. His best result was in 1933, finishing second to Mir Sultan Khan. He tied for first at the 1929/30 Hastings Premier Reserves alongside George Koltanowski ahead of Salo Flohr, Josef Rejfi≈ô, Ludwig Rellstab, C.H.O'D. Alexander, Dani√´l Noteboom, and Milan Vidmar. Tylor played in the top section, the Hastings Premier, nine times beginning in 1930/1. His best finish was 6th= in 1936/7. He was first reserve for the English team at the Hamburg 1930 Chess Olympiad.3rd Chess Olympiad: Hamburg 1930 at olimpbase.org Tylor won the British Correspondence Chess Championship in 1932, 1933, and 1934. He shared 5‚Äì6th at Margate 1936 with P. S. Milner-Barry, but he won their individual game and drew with 2nd- to 4th- place finishers Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca, Gideon St√•hlberg, and Erik Lundin (Salo Flohr won).

Sunnucks 1970 says Margate 1935, but this seems to be a typo. Mikhail Botvinnik noted that Tylor was using a tactile chess board that he incessantly fingered, as well as a device for counting the number of moves made. Tylor was President of the Midland Counties' Chess Union from 1947 to 1950, but his work for the university and for the welfare of the blind limited the time he had to devote to chess. Tylor also enjoyed bridge. He died in Oxford on 23 October 1968. References External links * *A photo of Tylor playing against Mir Sultan Khan *The chess prowess of T.H.

It is usually consistent with the research hypothesis because it is constructed from literature review, previous studies, etc. However, the research hypothesis is sometimes consistent with the null hypothesis. In statistics, alternative hypothesis is often denoted as Ha or H1. Hypotheses are formulated to compare in a statistical hypothesis test. In the domain of inferential statistics two rival hypotheses can be compared by explanatory power and predictive power. Example An example is where water quality in a stream has been observed over many years, and a test is made of the null hypothesis that \\"there is no change in quality between the first and second halves of the data\\", against the alternative hypothesis that \\"the quality is poorer in the second half of the record\\". History The concept of an alternative hypothesis in testing was devised by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, and it is used in the Neyman‚ÄìPearson lemma. It forms a major component in modern statistical hypothesis testing. However it was not part of Ronald Fisher's formulation of statistical hypothesis testing, and he opposed its use. In Fisher's approach to testing, the central idea is to assess whether the observed dataset could have resulted from chance if the null hypothesis were assumed to hold, notionally without preconceptions about what other models might hold. Modern statistical hypothesis testing accommodates this type of test since the alternative hypothesis can be just the negation of the null hypothesis. Types In the case of a scalar parameter, there are four principal types of alternative hypothesis: * Point. Point alternative hypotheses occur when the hypothesis test is framed so that the population distribution under the alternative hypothesis is a fully defined distribution, with no unknown parameters; such hypotheses are usually of no practical interest but are fundamental to theoretical considerations of statistical inference and are the basis of the Neyman‚ÄìPearson lemma. * One-tailed directional. A one-tailed directional alternative hypothesis is concerned with the region of rejection for only one tail of the sampling distribution. * Two- tailed directional. A two-tailed directional alternative hypothesis is concerned with both regions of rejection of the sampling distribution. * Non- directional. A non-directional alternative hypothesis is not concerned with either region of rejection, but, rather, it is only concerned that null hypothesis is not true.

Poe studied at the San Beda College in Mendiola, Manila from his elementary years up to his sophomore high school years. He transferred to the Jos√© Rizal College for junior and senior high school. He enrolled at the University of the Philippines to study Architecture. After college, he pursued a career in the movies like his older brother Ronnie. Because his real name was used by Ronnie professionally (\\"Fernando Poe Jr.\\"), he opted to use his nickname \\"Andy\\" as his professional name. Marriage In 1979, he met 20-year-old, Yvette Christine de Marcaida who was the leading lady of his brother FPJ in \\"Ang Lihim Ng Guadalupe\\" which was the entry of FPJ Productions in the 1979 Metro Manila Film Festival. Yvette descended from the Portuguese-Indian Barrettos of the Philippines and distantly related to the Barrettos based in Zambales.

The town is located on the Canterbury Plains to the west of Banks Peninsula, 22 kilometres southwest of Christchurch. The town has a population of making it the second largest town in the Selwyn District behind nearby Rolleston. Lincoln is a satellite town of Christchurch; at the 2006 Census, 53% of employed Lincoln residents worked in the city. The town is home to Lincoln University, the oldest agricultural tertiary institution in the Southern Hemisphere and the smallest of New Zealand's eight universities. History In 1862 James Edward FitzGerald of ‚ÄòThe Springs‚Äô subdivided some of his freehold land for the new township of Lincoln, named after the Earl of Lincoln, a foundation member of the Canterbury Association and from 1851 a member of the management committee. The site of Lincoln on the L1 River would allow for a flour mill to be built to service the growing farming district. Lincoln was laid out in a grid layout and FitzGerald named the four belts North, East, South and West and the cross streets after his own children Robert, Maurice and William. The main streets James, Edward and Gerald were names after himself. The new township steadily grew and by 1873 Lincoln had a post office, butcher, brewers, a baker and confectioner, a storekeeper who had a hotel, a wheelwright and a carpenter, and a blacksmith. The peaceful quality of Lincoln changed with the arrival of the railway line in 1875 and the opening of the Little River line in 1886. On 26 April 1875, a branch line railway was opened to Lincoln from a junction with the Main South Line in Hornby. This line became the Southbridge Branch. Within a few years, Lincoln became a junction itself, with the Little River Branch diverging from the Southbridge Branch in Lincoln. This branch opened to Birdling's Flat on 16 May 1882 and Little River itself on 11 March 1886. On 30 June 1962, Lincoln became a railway terminus when the Little River Branch and the Lincoln-Southbridge section of the Southbridge Branch were both closed. The railway did not last much longer in Lincoln, closing on 1 December 1967. Today, the Little River Rail Trail is being established along the railway's old route. The Prebbleton to Lincoln leg of the route was opened on 30 November 2006. The trail is used extensively for recreation.  Demographics  The Lincoln urban area had a population of 6,510 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,640 people (68.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 3,690 people (130.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 3,165 males and 3,345 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.95 males per female. Of the total population, 1,356 people (20.8%) were aged up to 15 years, 1,443 (22.2%) were 15 to 29, 2,883 (44.3%) were 30 to 64, and 831 (12.8%) were 65 or older. Ethnicities were 84.1% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 5.6% MƒÅori, 1.1% Pacific peoples, 12.0% Asian, and 3.3% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).

As well as the university, there are a number of other research facilities in Lincoln, including AgResearch, Institute for Plant and Food Research, FAR (Foundation for Arable Research), and Landcare Research. The High Performance Cricket training centre is also based at Lincoln University. Over 400 people are employed at these organisations making Lincoln a busy little country village. Lincoln also has a maternity hospital, kindergarten and golf course. Lincoln also hosts the first New Zealand supermarket to have wind turbines generating some of its power: Lincoln New World. The supermarket was built with a number of sustainable initiatives in keeping with the Enviro town it is servicing.

He joined 6 Music in April 2004.  Musical career  Born and raised in Manchester, Riley was in a band at school called the Sirens with Craig Scanlon and Steve Hanley (both of whom were later members of the Fall). Riley was an early fan of the Fall and worked for the group as a roadie.Cumming, Tim (2004) \\"Wild Thing\\", The Guardian, 19 January 2004, retrieved 12 December 2010 He was added to the line-up, playing bass, in May 1978. Riley's recording debut was The Fall's second single, \\"It's the New Thing\\" and their debut album Live at the Witch Trials. Riley switched to guitar and keyboards in 1979 and held this position with The Fall, until he fell out with Mark E. Smith in 1982, during the group's first tour of Australia and New Zealand. Riley was sacked by Smith ‚Äì according to Smith this occurred on Riley's wedding day.The Guardian, Monday 14 April 2008, p6 Riley was actually married on Christmas Eve 1982 and remained in The Fall until January 1983, when Smith met Riley in the Old Garratt pub, Princess Street, and told him that the group was undertaking a European tour without him and should it not work out he would be asked back. Riley is quoted as saying \\"Joining The Fall was the second best thing that ever happened to me in my working life. The best thing was getting kicked out\\". Later in 1983, Riley began to record under the name Marc Riley and The Creepers (later The Creepers).Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 483-4 Steve Hanley, Paul Hanley and Craig Scanlon, while they remained members of The Fall, played on Riley's first solo single, \\"Favourite Sister\\". Riley released several albums during the following years. Animosity between Smith and Riley continued to influence both bands' material. This included The Fall's \\"Hey Marc Riley\\" (a rewritten version of Bo Diddley's \\"Hey Bo Diddley\\"), which has only been available on live bootlegs. Riley responded in kind with his 1983 single \\"Jumper Clown\\" ‚Äì a reference to Smith's then affection for 1970s jumpers ‚Äì as well as \\"Snipe\\" on the 1985 EP Shadow Figure and his own rewrite of a Bo Diddley song: \\"Marc Riley is a Gunslinger\\". Riley co-owned the In-Tape label with Jim Khambatta, until it went bust in 1991, managing the label between 1983 and 1986.Buckley, Peter (2003) The Rough Guide to Rock, Rough Guides, \\"Marc Riley, Esq\\", Debretts.com, retrieved 12 December 2010 Between 1986 and 1989, Riley drew and wrote the comic strips Harry the Head and Doctor Mooney for the comic Oink!, as well as recording a flexidisc single for the comic as a giveaway. The Creepers disbanded in 1987. Riley then formed a band that included ex-members of Pere Ubu, The Magic Band and The Mekons called the Lost Soul Crusaders (named after a fictional group in an episode of the detective series 'Columbo' whose lead singer was played by one of Riley's heroes, Johnny Cash). However, the record company funding the band went bankrupt before any material could be recorded. In 1988, Riley co- produced (with Jon Langford) a Johnny Cash tribute album, Til Things are Brighter, to raise funds for the Terrence Higgins Trust.Popson, Tom (1988) \\"Johnny Cash Meets The Hip Britons: English Acts Record a Tribute to a 'Cool Dude'\\", Chicago Tribune, 29 July 1988, p. H  Radio career  Riley is perhaps best known as one half of the duo Mark and Lard with fellow DJ Mark Radcliffe, who together presented \\"Hit the North\\" on BBC Radio 5, then a children's, comedy, and drama network, with Radcliffe also fronting a weekly show called Out on Blue Six on BBC Radio 1 around the same time. During this period Riley also presented a programme on Radio 5 called Cult Radio, and wrote and produced a Radio 1 series presented by Noddy Holder called Glitter and Twisted. The duo moved to Radio 1's 10 pm slot in 1993, followed by an unsuccessful move to the breakfast show in February 1997, and finally to the 1 pm to 3 pm slot in October that year. Their final show on the station was in March 2004. After leaving Radio 1, the duo cordially went their separate ways; Riley moving to BBC Radio 6 Music and Radcliffe to BBC Radio 2.\\"Mark and Lard leave BBC Radio 1\\", BBC, 19 February 2004, retrieved 12 December 2010 In 2009 Mark and Lard reformed to front radio adverts for Manchester City in North West England (Riley is a long-time fan of the club).

Among the bands championed by Riley are Metronomy, Field Music, Everything Everything, Wild Beasts, Sweet Baboo and King Creosote and more recently Ty Segall, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Thee Oh Sees. He previously presented Mint with Rob Hughes on Sunday evenings. Hughes joins Riley's current show on Tuesdays (The A to Z series) and Thursdays (The Parallel Universe).

Episode 2 features Wire, Monotony and Jane Weaver, Episode 3 Teleman, Sara Lowes and Sauna Youth and Episode 4 Jesca Hoop, The Wytches and Richard Dawson. Riley together with Hughes wrote and presented an 'A to Z of Punk and New Wave' on BBC 6 Music which was then turned into a successful podcast. That was followed by the long term project 'The A to Z of David Bowie', a commercially available podcast, which was launched on 30 January 2018 and is expected to run for up to 70 episodes. Riley and Radcliffe formed the parody group Shirehorses, once appearing at the Glastonbury Festival in 1997 in what they called the headline slot, going on as they did at 10.00am.

Born and raised in Edinburgh, Quinan is a longtime campaigner for Scottish Independence, initially joining the Scottish National Party in 1974, later leaving in 2003. In 2015 the SNP selected him as a list candidate for the Lothian region. Theatre and television career A trained actor, he appeared in theatres throughout Scotland, including the Royal Lyceum, The Traverse, Perth Theatre, The Tron, Eden Court, The Pavilion, and was Assistant Director of The Scottish Theatre Company, Founder of the independent company, United Artists (Scotland). He directed new plays by Peter Arnott and George Gunn as well as the first Scottish production of Howard Barkers, Pity In History. Working as a freelance director he worked with many companies and theatres including The Citizens Theatre Glasgow, Unit One, The Traverse, Mayfest, The Borders Festival, Craigmillar Festival Society and directed plays, pantomimes and community pageants. He was an elected member of the Scottish Committee of the Equity Union for 12 years. Like so many theatre workers he had a parallel career in Television appearing in a number of dramas for BBC Scotland, Granada, STV and ITV. While working for STV in 1983 he became a presenter in the Education Department making over 200 programmes on Scottish History and Society (1983‚Äì89). In 1994 he returned to STV as The Weather Presenter on the stations LunchTime show. In 1995 he succeeded Bernard Ponsonby as the presenter of Trial By Night, a late night debate show. In 1996 he was Producer/Director on the Scottish Reporters series and co-produced The Professional Beggar for ITV First Tuesday. Quinan was an elected official of the NUJ and was involved in the work to rule dispute at the station. In 1998, he left STV after an acrimonious contract dispute. From 1998-99 Quinan worked as for Channel 4 News, UTV and RTE as a presenter/director. Political career Scottish Parliament In 1999 he was elected to represent the West of Scotland as an SNP candidate at the first Scottish Parliament election. During his time as an MSP, he served as the SNP's Deputy spokesperson for Social Inclusion 1999-2000, a member of the European Committee and the Audit Committee. He also served as Convener of the Cross Party Group on Autism in the Scottish Parliament, Vice-Convener of the Cross Party Group on Contemporary Music and was a member of the Cross Party Groups on Palestine and Cuba. An active anti-nuclear campaigner, Quinan was twice arrested for Breach of the Peace during blockades of the Faslane Nuclear Submarine base during his time as an MSP. Quinan went on to challenge his conviction in the High Court of Justiciary introducing a point of law which resulted in one of his convictions being set aside, this was seen as a minor victory for the anti-nuclear movement in Scotland. In 2002, while a vice- convener of the Scottish Parliament's cross-party group on Palestine, Quinan visited the Middle East on a week-long tour, linking with the Red Crescent and International Solidarity Movement. Quinan travelled to the West Bank as part of a group, but Israelis soldiers denied them entrance to Yasser Arafat's compound in Ramallah. The Israeli security forces fired stun grenades and shots in the air in order to force him away. For the 2003 Parliament election Quinan stood down from being a candidate in the West of Scotland, and instead sought nomination in his home city of Edinburgh. Quinan was unsuccessful in his bid, and went on to unsuccessfully contest the seat of Motherwell and Wishaw at the 2003 election. The seat was held by the Labour candidate: First Minister Jack McConnell. After Parliament Quinan stood in the 25 May 2003 Navarrese parliamentary election as a stand-in for Batasuna politicians, with Batasuna having been banned earlier in 2003 due to alleged links with ETA. Quinan likened his involvement to the involvement of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. In December 2003 Quinan left the SNP for the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP). Quinan explained that he felt that the SNP no longer represented his political beliefs. Quinan subsequently unsuccessfully attempted to become one of the SSP's candidates for the 2004 European Parliament election. Quinan left the SSP later in 2004. Quinan was a 'Yes' supporter who was active during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign. At one public meeting in North Berwick where he spoke, some of his closing remarks were seized upon by sections of the No campaign. Quinan had said that Scots \\"have an opportunity to change the lives and life chances of our children for he future\\" but then went on to say \\"I will be partisan about it, if you vote 'No' you leave them with more of the same, then you're a bad parent.\\" Quinan sought the SNP nomination for the seat of Edinburgh East for the 2015 general election, but ultimately lost out to Tommy Sheppard. Quinan stood in the 2016 Scottish parliamentary election as an SNP candidate for the Lothian region, but was not elected.

Originally the protocol fixed the exposed node problem as well, but modern RTS/CTS includes ACKs and does not solve the exposed node problem.  Frame format  The RTS frame contains five fields, which are: # Frame Control # Duration # RA (Receiver Address) # TA (Transmitter Address) # FCS The CTS frame contains four fields, which are: # Frame Control # Duration # RA (Receiver Address) # FCS The ACK frame contains four fields, which are: # Frame Control # Duration # RA (Receiver Address) # FCS RA ‚Äì Receiver Address indicating the MAC address of the station that shall receive frame. TA ‚Äì Transmitter Address indicating the MAC address of the station which has transmitted frame. FCS ‚Äì Frame Check Sequence. This protocol was designed under the assumption that all nodes have the same transmission ranges, and does not solve the hidden terminal problem. The RTS/CTS frames can cause a new problem called the exposed terminal problem in which a wireless node that is nearby, but is associated with another access point, overhears the exchange and then is signaled to back off and cease transmitting for the time specified in the RTS. RTS/CTS is an additional method to implement virtual carrier sensing in carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). By default, 802.11 relies on physical carrier sensing only, which is known to suffer from the hidden node problem. The RTS/CTS packet size threshold is 0‚Äì2347 octets. Typically, sending RTS/CTS frames does not occur unless the packet size exceeds this threshold. If the packet size that the node wants to transmit is larger than the threshold, the RTS/CTS handshake gets triggered. Otherwise, the data frame gets sent immediately. IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS mechanism could help solve exposed node problem as well, only if the nodes are synchronized and packet sizes and data rates are the same for both the transmitting nodes. When a node hears an RTS from a neighboring node, but not the corresponding CTS, that node can deduce that it is an exposed node and is permitted to transmit to other neighboring nodes. If the nodes are not synchronized (or if the packet sizes are different or the data rates are different) the problem may occur that the exposed node will not hear the CTS or the ACK during the transmission of data of its neighbor.

He emigrated to Sweden with his parents in 1949 at the age of twelve. He was educated as a social worker and hoped to become a journalist, but became increasingly involved in music, performing at events for students with idiosyncratic humor and social engagement. Cornelis Vreeswijk is considered one of the most influential and successful troubadours in Sweden. In 2010 a Swedish drama film, called Cornelis, was made about his life. It was directed by Amir Chamdin. Early life Cornelis Vreeswijk was born and grew up in Holland. He emigrated to Sweden with his parents in 1949 at the age of twelve. He left school in 1955 and went to sea, where he passed the time playing the blues. He returned to Sweden in 1959. He was educated as a social worker at Stockholm University and hoped to become a journalist, but became increasingly involved in music, performing at events for students with idiosyncratic humor and social engagement. Swedish career Vreeswijk explained in one of his few interviews that he had taught himself to sing and play in the fifties by imitating his first idols Josh White and Lead Belly. His first album, Ballader och of√∂rsk√§mdheter (Ballads and rudenesses, 1964), was a hit which immediately gained him a large following among the emerging radical student generation. In this period he also played with Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and his trio. His songs \\"√Öngb√•tsblues\\" (\\"Steam Boat Blues\\") and \\"Jubelvisa f√∂r Fiffiga Nanette\\" (\\"Joyful song for Clever Nanette\\") are classics from these recordings. His abrasive, frequently political lyrics and unconventional delivery were a deliberate break with what he was later to describe as a Swedish song tradition of pretty singing and harmless lyrics, \\"a hobby for the upper classes\\". Influenced by jazz and blues and especially by the singing style and social criticism of Georges Brassens, Vreeswijk \\"speak-sings\\" his \\"insults\\", and compels his listeners to pay close attention to the words. Sculpture of Cornelis Vreeswijk, as displayed in Cornelis Park in Stockholm His 1965 loose translation of Allan Sherman's masterpiece \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\\" remains beloved to Swedes as \\"Brev fr√•n kolonien\\" (Letter from the summer camp) decades later, and could be said to have passed into folklore. A political singer with a bohemian lifestyle, Vreeswijk remained controversial in the sixties and early seventies, idolized by his fans but disapproved of by many others for his \\"rude\\" language and persistent interest in \\"unsuitable\\" people like prostitutes and criminals. Some of his records were blacklisted by the public broadcasting company Sveriges Radio. During this period, he not only wrote and recorded songs now considered classics, such as \\"Sportiga Marie\\" (\\"Sporty Marie\\") and several affectionate salutes to the ever less employable \\"Polaren P√§r\\" (\\"My Buddy P√§r\\"), but he was an actor on the stage, receiving considerable critical acclaim, most notably as Pilate in the Swedish version of Jesus Christ Superstar, and as Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof. He participated in Melodifestivalen (the Swedish preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest) in 1972 with \\"√ñnskar du mig, s√• √∂nskar jag dig\\", which finished sixth. He also appeared in movies, including Svarta Palmkronor (Black Palm Trees, 1968), which was filmed on location in Brazil. Spending four months in Brazil began Vreeswijk's lifelong interest in Latin American music and social and political conditions, later seen for example in his Victor Jara album of 1978. Portrait of Cornelis Vreeswijk by the Swedish painter Tommy Tallstig Later in his career, Vreeswijk was to gain increasing fame and a wider audience both for his songs and his other work. He published several volumes of poetry in his lifetime and left a considerable manuscript legacy of poems which have been published since. He also became an important musical interpreter of the works of other people, recording the songs of Carl Michael Bellman, Evert Taube, and Lars Forssell. His fresh, bluesy renderings of Bellman and Taube, who had up to then been classics belonging to the \\"harmless\\" tradition that Vreeswijk despised, were artistic and commercial successes which extended his fanbase. The choice of Bellman was significant: Bellman's lively, romantic, pastoral, drinking and sometimes bawdy songs gained Vreeswijk the reputation of being a drunken womaniser, with the association of being \\"something of a Bellman himself\\". Like his friend Fred √Ökerstr√∂m, he gave Bellman's songs, \\"a new and more powerful expression\\" than they had had before, and like him identifying himself with Bellman's fictional character Fredman, expressing his drunkenness, poverty, and despair, with an intensity that increased in his performances over the years. Bellman's songs featured in many of his performances; two of his albums were dedicated to Bellman's songs, namely the 1971 Spring mot Ulla, spring! Cornelis sjunger Bellman containing 13 of Fredman's Epistles, and the 1977 Movitz! Movitz!, containing 12: the popular Epistle 81, M√§rk hur v√•r skugga, appears on both albums. Vreeswijk's own best-known songs of the later seventies and early eighties tend to be dark in tone, like \\"Sist jag √•kte jumbojet blues\\" (\\"Last time I Went by Jumbojet Blues\\", a metaphorical bad trip) and \\"Blues f√∂r Fatumeh\\", both addressing heavy drug addiction. Even though in this period Vreeswijk was a prey of tabloid scandal and was in the news for his drinking problem and his debts (about both of which he spoke with frankness) rather than for his achievements, he remained highly creative and productive and he is also known as the co-writer of the Hep Stars song \\"Speleman\\" which was released for their album Songs We Sang 68' Vreeswijk's tombstone at Katarina kyrka Towards the end of Vreeswijk's life his reputation soared again, aided by the televising of some highly regarded nightclub shows, and by Agneta Brunius' TV documentary Balladen om den flygande holl√§ndaren (The Ballad of the Flying Dutchman) in 1986. By the time of his death from liver cancer at the age of fifty, Cornelis Vreeswijk had become an icon of the Swedish music scene, and he was honored with burial at the cemetery of Katarina kyrka, a national cemetery in Stockholm. In 2010, Cornelis, a movie about his life, premiered in Swedish cinemas. Norwegian singer Hans Erik Dyvik Husby (previously in Turbonegro) played the role of Vreeswijk.  Dutch career  Cornelis Vreeswijk (1967) In 1966, the Dutch broadcasting organisation VARA invited Vreeswijk to the Netherlands. He translated several of his songs into Dutch, and wrote a couple of new ones. One of his songs, \\"De nozem en de non\\" (\\"The Greaser and the Nun\\"), was released as a single, without much popular success. His first Dutch album was only released in 1972, after ten successful Swedish albums. 100,000 copies of Cornelis Vreeswijk were sold, and the single \\"Veronica\\" became a big hit after it was picked up by the pirate radio station Veronica. His old song \\"De nozem en de non\\" was then re-recorded and released with much success. His later albums could not match the success of the first one, and Vreeswijk never achieved the fame in the Netherlands that he did in Sweden. Nowadays, only \\"De nozem en de non\\" is still known by the general Dutch public. Vreeswijk still has some fans in the Netherlands, however, and in 2000 the Cornelis Vreeswijk society was founded. One reason for his lack of popularity in the Netherlands was the impression that he was a bit old- fashioned. Because of his long stay in Sweden, though he never became a citizen, the Dutch pronunciation and idiom that he had learned to speak in his youth were out-of-date in the seventies and eighties. Although he was fluent in both Dutch and Swedish, the latter became his primary language. His Stockholm-accented Swedish was famously witty and expressive, and in an interview he once suggested that the process of learning the language in his teens might have energized his use of it: \\"It doesn't just fall over you like when you're a baby and fed daily with words and food. You become freer, less respectful. ... Swedish is such a different language. Pure, distinct, beautiful. It has few synonyms. But they're many enough for me\\". Later life He gave his last concert in Uppsala in September 1987, suffering from cancer and diabetes. He recorded his last album and a book of poetry, both entitled Till Fatumeh. He travelled one last time to Holland to see his family, returned to Stockholm and died soon afterwards.

More than 100 examples are recorded in France and 70 in England, while further sites are known in Scandinavia, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Ireland and Slovakia. The term \\"causewayed enclosure\\" is now preferred to the older term causewayed camp as it has been demonstrated that the sites did not necessarily serve as occupation sites. Construction Causewayed enclosures are often located on hilltop sites, encircled by one to four concentric ditches with an internal bank. Enclosures located in lowland areas are generally larger than hilltop ones. Crossing the ditches at intervals are causeways which give the monuments their names. It appears that the ditches were excavated in sections, leaving the wide causeways intact in between. They should not be confused with segmented, or causewayed ring ditches, which are smaller and are thought to relate only to funerary activity, or with hillforts, which appeared later and had a definite defensive function. With regard to defensive functionality, however, evidence of timber palisades has been found at some sites such as Hambledon Hill. Function Archaeological evidence implies that the enclosures were visited occasionally by Neolithic groups rather than being permanently occupied. The presence of human remains in the banks and ditches of the enclosures has been seen as an attempt by the builders to connect their ancestors with the land and thus begin to anchor themselves to specific areas. Longitudinal sections excavated along the ditches by archaeologists suggest that the builders repeatedly redug the ditches and each time deliberately deposited pottery and human and animal bones, apparently as a regular ritual. Environmental archaeology suggests that the European landscape was in general heavily forested when the enclosures were built and that they were rare clearings in the woodland that were used for various social and economic activities. In the 1970s the archaeologist Peter Drewett suggested seven possible functions for the sites: * Settlement * Defence * Cattle compounds or kraals * Trade centres * Communal meeting places for feasting and other social activities * Cult/ritual centres * Burial sites Other interpretations have seen the causeways as symbolic of multi-directional access to the site by scattered communities, the enclosures as funerary centres for excarnation or the construction of the site being a communal act of creation by a fragmented society. Animal remains (especially cattle bone), domestic waste and pottery have been found at the sites. But there has been limited evidence of any structures. In some locations, such as Windmill Hill, Avebury, evidence of human occupation predates the enclosure. Generally, it appears that the ditches were permitted to silt up, even while the camps were in use, and then re-excavated episodically. It is unlikely that they had a strong defensive purpose. The earthworks may have been designed to keep out wild animals rather than people. The sequential addition of second, third and fourth circuits of banks and ditches may have come about through growing populations adding to the significance of their peoples' monument over time. In some cases, they appear to have evolved into more permanent settlements. Most causewayed enclosures have been ploughed away in the intervening millennia and are recognized through aerial archaeology. The first were constructed in the fifth millennium BCE and by the early third millennium BCE; notable regional variations occur in their construction. French examples begin to demonstrate elaborate horn-shaped entrances which are interpreted as being designed to impress from afar rather than serve any practical purpose. Aubrey Burl believes that building of causewayed enclosures declined by 3000 BC and they were superseded by more localised types of earthworks and other structures. In Britain, such replacements include Stonehenge I, Flagstones, Duggleby Howe and Ring of Bookan, and the later henge monuments.

The United States Shipping Board (USSB) was established as an emergency agency by the 1916 Shipping Act (39 Stat. 729), on September 7, 1916. The United States Shipping Board task was to increase the number of US ships supporting the World War I efforts. United States Shipping Board program ended on March 2, 1934.  Initiation  The United States' maritime position had been eroding for decades with some Congressional concern, some remedies actually worsening the situation, with European shipping companies dominating overseas trade and just over 10% of the value of trade carried in U.S. owned ships. The 1916 act was the end result of Congressional efforts to create a board to address the problem dating from 1914. At this time the legislation was not a part of any war effort with specific intent as stated in the act: :\\"An Act to establish a United States Shipping Board for the purpose of encouraging, developing, and creating a naval auxiliary and naval reserve and a Merchant Marine to meet the requirements of the commerce of the United States with its territories and possessions and with foreign countries; to regulate carriers by water engaged in the foreign and interstate commerce of the United States for other purposes.\\" A board of five commissioners was to be appointed by the president with confirmation by the United States Senate as the United States Shipping Board (USSB) to acquire and construct suitable vessels and to create corporations under its control to execute the programs. In essence, the USSB was given \\"complete control over American ships and shipping\\". President Woodrow Wilson made public his nominations for the board on 22 December 1916 with some dissatisfaction in the shipping industry about particular nominees and the board's power to set ocean freight rates raising particular concern and skepticism. The initial nominees were: William Denman (Chairman), instrumental in drafting the legislation for the establishment of the USSB, for a term of six years, Bernard N. Baker for five years, John A. Donald for four years, James B. White for three years and Theodore Brent for a two-year term. The members of the board gathered in Washington the first week of January 1917 to plan and organize while awaiting confirmation which came in late January with the formal organization of the USSB being on 30 January. United States vessels had suffered a disadvantage and the laws passed by Congress had in some cases had the effect of giving advantage to European shipping instead of the desired effect so that the country was heavily dependent on foreign shipping. With the outbreak of war in Europe the national fleets of the warring countries became involved in those countries' wartime efforts and were withdrawn from commercial trade vital to United States commerce. One initial step was granting authority to the President to allow registration of foreign built ships owned by United States companies to enter the United States registry and operate under the United States flag and repeal certain penalties for those using foreign built vessels. The net effect was negligible as shipbuilding in the United States declined almost equally with the benefits gained. United States entry into the war just over two months after the board began its work completely changed the focus from general strengthening the nation's maritime position to a massive wartime program. Though it was sometimes referred to as the War Shipping Board, the official title remained the United States Shipping Board. The USSB was to address the shortage of shipping through acquisition of existing hulls and, with the declaration of war by the United States on 6 April 1917, a construction program through its Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) that was created 16 April. The precedent for using such a corporation had been set during the construction of the Panama Canal during which the Panama Railway Company, charged with much of the construction, had its stock entirely owned by the Secretary of War. The Shipping Act had explicitly empowered the USSB to found such a company and that was done with issuance of $50,000,000 in stock all initially held by the USSB and of which a majority portion must be retained with a provision that trustees of the EFC must also hold stock. During the war Congress granted the President extraordinary wartime powers that were used by means of Executive Orders to expand the authority of USSB and its corporation. The USSB, as a regulatory and policy body, executed its programs largely through the EFC which was a separate entity that was fully under the policy control of the majority stockholder, the USSB. The Chairman of the USSB was initially the head of the EFC but the General Manager had all real authority except the power to sign contracts. The division of authority between the USSB and EFC and the construction program's direction led to conflict between Chairman Denman and the EFC's General Manager, Major-General Goethals, resulting in the resignation of both men and reconstitution of the board and corporation. The new USSB composition that remained throughout the war was Edward N. Hurley, Chairman, with Raymond B. Stevens replacing James B. White as Vice-chairman and John Donald, Bainbridge Colby and Charles R. Page as members. Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps, formerly Constructor of the Navy and Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Construction, became the General Manager of the EFC. World War I Shipbuilding prior to the entry of the United States into World War I had been expanded to some extent with domestic shipping companies replacing ships withdrawn from trade by belligerents and both the United Kingdom and neutrals contracting for ships in U.S. yards. The U.K. had contracted for ships through private British companies both for security and U.S. neutrality needs. In March 1917, just before U.S. entry into the war and the USSB shifting to full wartime operations, there were about 700,000 tons of new construction underway for the private U.K. owners and all 234 building ways in the U.S. occupied by either those or ships for neutral and domestic shipping lines. There was no possibility to quickly expand capacity to incorporate the USSB/EFC shipbuilding program. Providing hulls =Interned enemy ships= Kronprinzessin Cecilie at Bar Harbor, Maine The most readily available hulls were 91 German vessels of aggregate tonnage refurbished for use by the USSB and under legislation of 12 May 1917 and an Executive Order of 30 June 1917 giving the USSB power to formally seize the vessels and enter them into the U.S. registry. The report of December 1918 shows 1 Austrian steamer, 87 German steamers that now included 4 from Cuba, and 7 sailing vessels seized. Some of Germany's premier liners, such as , , , Astoria, Pensacola, Aeolus, Mercury, Pocahontas, Powhatan, Prinz Eitel Friedrich, Republic, President Lincoln, Kaiser Wilhelm II, Antigone, Rhein, Kronprinz Wilhelm, Covington and , were among the seized ships.United States Navy and World War I: 1914‚Äì1922 by Frank A. Blazich Jr., PhD On 15 November 1917 the USSB authorized negotiations with foreign countries that had seized German or Austrian ships with actual discussions during December and into January 1918. The result was either charter or outright purchase of a number of ships interned from South America to China. =Commandeering existing construction= USS West Bridge, the commandeered British ship War Topaz The USSB's first action regarding new construction was commandeering every contract, hull and even steel in the U.S. yards for ships over . The first order was signed by Chairman Hurley on 3 August 1917 to be executed by the EFC to secure control of the shipyards and construction already underway. The action was immediately protested by nearly every shipyard and owner of the ships under construction with the foreign owners protesting through the State Department. A large number of the contracts and ships under construction for foreign accounts were for the United Kingdom and the protest was solved with that government's agreement that the ships would be used in the total war effort. With one exception, a new ship from Union Iron Works already loaded for departure named War Sword, the contracts and ships were requisitioned. Out of 431 such ships, totaling , requisitioned 414 were completed after cancellations of some contracts for ships of unwanted design that were in early stages of construction or not yet laid down. A very large group of these ships, contracted with names prefixed with \\"War\\" and renamed before completion, were being built for the British Shipping Controller of Ministry of Shipping under various shipping line contracts. Examples of these ships are , which became USS West Bridge, and one of the Great Lakes built ships, originally War Bayonet, which became USS Lake Superior for the first war and USS Tuluran for the second. Others among these ships found service in the next war; for example, War Dido was torpedoed and sunk as in 1941, and War Dragon was seized by Japan and sunk as Renzan Maru by on 1 January 1943. Some being built for domestic shippers had long careers, with and Oriente being examples. =Construction program= The Board's construction program, most notably the Hog Islander ships, was executed through Emergency Fleet Corporation which it established 16 April 1917. Western World in 1922 The shipbuilding program was concluded with the 9 May 1922 delivery of the ship completed and delivered as Western World, launched as Nutmeg State 17 September 1921, by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation at Sparrows Point, Maryland. Ship management When ships were delivered from the builder to the USSB they came under the management of the Division of Operations which allocated them to the War Department, Navy Department or commercial service based on needs and the class and type of ship. By December 1918 the division had become the largest ship operating entity in U.S. history with a total fleet of 1,386 vessels totaling either owned outright, managed or chartered. To further control traffic required by the war effort, methods applied by the British were employed in which rates were adjusted and control was exercised through the division's Chartering Committee, whose approval was necessary to obtain license to refuel in U.S. ports. With U.S. registered ships already under tight control, these regulations were largely directed at neutrals. A specific example was the preferred trade by neutrals in manganese with eastern South America, when the war effort required nitrates from the west coast countries so that the board's efforts were directed to shift the balance. Enforcement of rates was strict and at one point, before wide compliance, 136 steamers were held in U.S. ports. By December 1918, the USSB directly controlled such a large portion of U.S. shipping through ownership and charter that the USSB's prewar rate setting regulatory function had largely become a minor factor. A Maritime Intelligence Department within the division and a separate Division of Planning and Statistics collected and analyzed shipping data in order to help determine what level of shipping was necessary for commerce and how much could be shifted to the war effort. Ship manning As of 1 June 1917, the USSB established a recruiting service with headquarters in Boston, with the first of an eventual 43 training centers, in recognition that traditional methods were too slow for the rapid wartime expansion, for deck officers at Cambridge, Massachusetts on 4 June. A second set of schools was created for engineering officers, with those for engineers destined for turbine powered ships sent to the builders of turbines for training. The early result, between 1 June 1917 and 1 October 1918 was 11,618 licensed officers. The officer training was expanded to training for crew, deck sailors, firemen, wipers, cooks and stewards, by December 1917 and open to all male citizens between the ages of 18 through 20 and 32 though 35 with a goal expanded from an estimated 85,000 to 200,000 due to the revised estimates of ships by the end of the war. To ensure labor problems did not disrupt necessary war shipping, the USSB employed special labor consultants and entered into agreements with labor and other government agencies to resolve labor disputes directly and also standardize wages across the industry. One of the USSB organizations specifically concerned with the issue was the Marine and Dock Industrial Relations Division to coordinate all labor related matters, and by late 1918 industry and labor had begun referring disputes to the board and thus avoiding any stoppages. Post war and abolishment The USSB operated a shipping business with its surplus ships until 1920 when the overseas freight market collapsed and it began to lay up its vessels. In 1925 Henry Ford bought 199 of these out of service ships for $1,697,470 as part of an investigation into the secondary use of materials. The first ship reached the Ford River Rouge Complex in November the same year and all the remaining ships were broken down and recycled the following summer. The USSB was abolished effective March 2, 1934. Its successor agencies have been the U.S. Shipping Board Bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce (1933‚Äì36); the U.S. Maritime Commission (1936‚Äì50); the U.S. Federal Maritime Board of the Department of Commerce (regulatory functions only, 1950‚Äì61); the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (regulatory functions only, 1961‚Äì ); the United States Maritime Administration of the Department of Commerce (all other functions, 1950‚Äì81); and the U.S. Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation (all other functions, 1981‚Äì ).

History Burial site of many members of the DMP, Glasnevin Cemetery. 19th century The Dublin city police had been subject to major reforms in 1786 and 1808.Stanley H. Palmer, 'Drummond, Thomas (1797‚Äì1840)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 Organised rural policing in Ireland began when Robert Peel, then Chief Secretary for Ireland, created the Peace Preservation Force in 1814. This rudimentary paramilitary police force was designed to provide policing in rural Ireland, replacing the 18th century system of watchmen, baronial constables, revenue officers and British military forces. Peel went on to found the London Metropolitan Police. In 1822, a new Act created four improved \\"County\\" Constabularies, whose organisation was based around the traditional provinces of Ireland. =1836: reform= In 1836, the county constabularies were merged into a new centralised Constabulary of Ireland, and the Peace Preservation Force ceased to exist. At the same time separate non-paramilitary forces were set up in the largest cities: Dublin, Belfast, and Derry. A perceived lack of impartiality following rioting in the municipal police forces of Belfast and Derry saw both forces absorbed by the national force in 1865 and 1870 respectively, and only Dublin maintained its separate force. The DMP was established under the Dublin Police Act 18366 & 7 Will.4 c.29 as an unarmed, uniformed force of one thousand day and night constables. The Castle-controlled organisation was more accountable than the untrained constables and night watchmen it replaced. The 1836 Act authorised the \\"chief governor of Ireland\\" to establish a police office in Dublin, supported by two salaried justices, to administer the police force which would be under the direction of the Chief Secretary for Ireland. It also provided for the recruitment and appointment of policemen and the regulation of their conduct. It also created powers of arrest and made arrangements for the financial affairs of the new force, including new taxation. The DMP was modelled closely on London's Metropolitan Police. Not only were the uniforms of the two forces almost indistinguishable, especially after the helmet and Bath Star were adopted, but the two forces also had a similar organisational structure; rather than a Chief Constable, they were commanded by a Commissioner, who was not a police officer, but a magistrate holding a Commission of the Peace. This was descended from the 18th century system of controlling parish constables, and was a sop to the public's fears about the danger of a standing police force under government control. A policeman is about to check an approaching car near Phibsborough. =1880s: Land War= The force came under considerable pressure in the 1880s during the Land War, in which 500 policemen were injured. A series of protest meetings were held and strikes were threatened in 1882. 20th century Sackville Street, August 1913 =1913‚Äì14: Dublin Lock-out= Two men died and several hundred people were injured over the course of the five-month Dublin Lock-out, including two hundred policemen. Although the police were involved in \\"frequent collisions\\" with union members and used tactics such as baton charges against them, a vice-regal commission cleared them of wrongdoing after the events ‚Äì though their reputation had suffered considerably. =1916 onwards= As an unarmed urban force, the Dublin Metropolitan Police did not participate as actively in the War of Independence as did the RIC, and as such did not suffer the casualty rate of that force, although three men were killed and seven injured. One of their number David Neligan (who was an IRA agent) records in his book \\"The Spy in the Castle\\" that the majority of the DMP uniformed personnel observed a neutral role, restricted to traditional policing functions. The political \\"G\\" Division did not come off so lightly, and selected \\"G men\\" were first given warnings by the Irish Republican Army in April 1919. Five members of \\"G\\" Division were subsequently killed by the IRA, the first in July 1919. Many DMP officers actively assisted the IRA, most notably Edward Broy, who passed valuable intelligence to Michael Collins throughout the conflict. In the 1996 film Michael Collins, Broy is discovered and subsequently tortured and killed by the British. In reality, he was not caught and went on to become the Commissioner of the in the 1930s. His fate in the film is based on that of Dick McKee, who, with Peadar Clancy and the civilian Conor Clune, was murdered after torture in Dublin Castle on \\"Bloody Sunday\\", 21 November 1920. After the creation of the Irish Free State, the DMP became known as (Police of Dublin) from 1922‚Äì1925, after which the force ceased to exist as a separate entity, being absorbed into the (Guardians of the Peace). Its last Commissioner was W.R.E. Murphy. \\"Dublin Metropolitan\\" is today a geographic region of the 's command structure. Unlike the RIC, but in common with police forces in Great Britain, the DMP was an unarmed force. In this, it provided the inspiration for the first Commissioner of the , who declared that the new force should also be unarmed.

J. Cronin. Short stories The character Dr Finlay first appeared in Cronin's novella Country Doctor and in several subsequent short stories published in Hearst's International Combined with Cosmopolitan magazine from 1935 to 1939. The stories were later collected and republished under several titles, including Adventures of a Black Bag, Dr Finlay of Tannochbrae, Further Adventures of a Country Doctor and Dr Finlay's Casebook. Dr Finlay is a general physician beginning his practice in the fictional Scottish town of Levenford. One of the later short stories takes him to the lochside village of Tannochbrae. In these stories he is charming and becomes well-acquainted with his patients over many years. It is thus his trademark to know them from birth to death and so provide a continuous relationship. Adaptations The stories were used as the basis of the long-running BBC television programme Dr Finlay's Casebook, screened from 1962 to 1971, and the radio series of the same title (1970‚Äì78). In these productions the main character, rechristened Dr Alan Finlay, was played by Bill Simpson. He was made the newly joined junior partner in the Tannochbrae practice of Dr Cameron, played by Andrew Cruickshank, with Janet, their unflappable housekeeper and receptionist at Arden House, played by Barbara Mullen. Dr Finlay returned to television in the ITV series, Doctor Finlay, continuing the stories into the late 1940s. This version starred David Rintoul as Dr Finlay, Ian Bannen as Dr Cameron and Annette Crosbie as Janet. It was later broadcast in the U.S. on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre. The characters made their return to radio in 2001, when BBC Radio 4 broadcast a six-episode series, Dr Finlay: Adventures of a Black Bag, set in Levenford, with John Gordon Sinclair voicing Dr Finlay, Brian Pettifer as Dr Cameron, Katy Murphy as Janet and the nurse Peggy Angus played by Sharon Small. This was followed by two series of Dr Finlay: Further Adventures of a Black Bag in 2002 and 2003, with Sinclair and Pettifer joined by Celia Imrie as Janet and Stella Gonet as Nurse Angus.

It lies within the borders of the Nelson Lakes National Park. The valley through which the river flows is popular with trampers and is part of the Travers-Sabine tramping circuit, which follows a major portion of the river, starting from Kerr Bay at Saint Arnaud and, after crossing the Travers Saddle (1787 metres), descends the valley of the Sabine River. The river feeds into Lake Rotoiti. It is not a navigable waterway due to its small size and numerous rocky cascades. The lower reaches of the river lie in open tussock which was burnt and grazed by early European settlers. Further upstream the river flows through unmodified beech forest. The upper reaches are in subalpine scrub above the bushline.

In February 2002, he hosted the game show flop Shafted, which was cancelled in April of the same year. Later in 2002 he was a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother. Symons' on-camera persona is a sarcastic killjoy, a role he apparently adopted through his appearance as third judge on 'Red Faces'. On Test Australia: The National IQ Test, he scored higher than any of the other celebrities with an IQ of 131. In October 2005, Symons together with his wife, Elly, competed in and won the 'Celebrity Couples Great Temptation' (Australian game show)with Elly answering all the questions in the fast money round during the grand final. He also competed in Australia's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? getting as far as the $500,000 question in 2000, at which point a wrong answer caused him to lose the majority of the money, going away with $16,000 for his chosen charity and $16,000 for his home viewer. Despite public/fan outcry that he should have used his last remaining lifeline (50:50‚Äî2 incorrect answers of the 4 multi-choice answers are removed), Symons maintains he was confident about the answer and wanted to save the lifeline for the final million dollar question. Australia's A Current Affair program interviewed him later that week, during which they presented him with his would-be million dollar question, using his still available lifeline, Symons was able to pick the correct answer. He also competed in the Network Ten's Australia's Brainiest Comedian in November 2005 where he came third. In August 2008, Symons participated on a celebrity edition of Deal or No Deal, on which he won $4,000 for a home viewer. He was also a regular member of the brains trust on ABC TV's The Einstein Factor. In 2007, he signed up with Channel Seven and to become a judge on Australia's Got Talent along with Dannii Minogue and Tom Burlinson. He remained on the show until 2009 and was replaced by Brian McFadden. In 2009, Symons appeared on the two high-rating Hey Hey Reunion Specials, and in 2010, returned to the 20-episode airing of Hey Hey It's Saturday. Radio career Symons originally appeared as a presenter in a weekly slot on the ABC Radio Melbourne's breakfast radio program. He then filled in for Lynne Haultain on the breakfast program while she was on maternity leave, replacing her permanently in that slot in 2003, and continuing in the role until late 2017. In June 2017, Symons interviewed fellow ABC radio presenter Beverley Wang about her new podcast, It's Not a Race. During the interview, Symons asked Wang questions such as \\"What's the deal with Asians?\\", \\"Are they all the same?\\" and \\"Are you yellow?\\", and defended the infamous \\"blackface\\" skit on Hey Hey It's Saturday. Most of the controversial comments were edited out of the broadcast interview, but Wang released the full interview on the podcast feed. The ABC removed the recording, saying that \\"a review of the editorial processes around this content and its use is in progress\\" and apologised for its broadcast. In December 2017 Symons announced that he would not return to the breakfast presenter role in 2018 after he was advised that the ABC did not renew his contract. Personal life Symons married ( divorced ) Elly Agrotis in 1990 and together they had three sons, Samuel, Raphael and Joel. An Australian Story episode aired in February 2010 documented his son Samuel's fifteen-year battle with cancer. The episode won a silver medal at the 2011 New York Festivals \\"Worlds Best T.V. and Films\\" Category and a Quill award in 2010 from the Melbourne Press Club for Best Current Affairs Feature. Samuel died from an aggressive brain cancer on 3 October 2018.https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/broadcaster-red-symons- son-dies-20181003-p507gf.html References Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Male actors from Melbourne Category:Australian agnostics Category:Australian game show hosts Category:Australia's Got Talent Category:Musicians from Melbourne Category:Radio personalities from Melbourne Category:People from Brighton Category:University of Melbourne alumni Category:Writers from Melbourne Category:English emigrants to Australia Category:Australian rock guitarists Category:Australian male singers Category:Australian songwriters Category:Naturalised citizens of Australia Category:Lead guitarists Category:Australian male guitarists ","title":"Red Symons"},{"id":"645984","text":"Glasgow University Union (GUU) is one of the largest and oldest students' unions in the UK, serving students and alumni of the University of Glasgow since 1885. The GUU organises social affairs for its members, provides catering and entertainment. Students are eligible to become members for free at any point throughout their University career and alumni may become Life Members by applying to the Board of Management. History Foundation Students at the university instituted the idea of a union building in 1885 to help promote social interaction on campus. The union's formation was driven by members of Glasgow University Dialectic Society, the Glasgow University Medico-Chirurgical Society and the Glasgow University Athletic Club. The same group formed a Students‚Äô Representative Council in 1886 to raise funds for the building and procured the sum of ¬£5000 from Dr John McIntyre of Odiham, Hampshire. In 1889 the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council obtained statutory recognition under the Act of 1889 and in 1890 they managed to raise sufficient funds to build the union. The Glasgow University Union's building at No. 32 University Avenue has been home to the GUU since 1931. The union was originally accommodated in the John McIntyre Building, named for a major benefactor, which opened in 1890 and was designed by John James Burnet. These premises soon proved to be inadequate however, and a new building at the foot of University Avenue was designed by the architect and former assistant to J.J. Burnet, Alan McNaughton of Arthur & McNaughton in the Scots Baronial style. The new Union building was financed from funds raised by donations to the Student Welfare Scheme, started in 1921 to re-invigorate student life and was erected between 1929 and 1931, with the women of the Queen Margaret Union (QMU) moving into the John McIntyre Building in 1932. The John MacIntyre has been the location of the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council, since the new QMU building opened in 1969. An extension to the Glasgow University Union building was designed by Keppie, Henderson & Partners and opened in 1965, which housed four bars: Deep Six, the Gallery Bar, Altitude and Playing Fields - and the union's nightclub, The Hive. The extension was closed in late January 2013, with demolition of the building following in July of that year. Construction of a new 4,191m2, ¬£13.4 million sports and social facility designed by Page/Park Architects and ECD Architects began in June 2014. This is a shared premises with Glasgow University Sports Association. The GUU element of the building includes a revitalised Hive nightclub and three bars: The Well, Base and G12. The new facility was completed in September 2015 and formally launched on 17 October 2015. Two-union structure The GUU is one of two unions at the University of Glasgow, the other being the Queen Margaret Union, which was established in 1890, after the first matriculation of women at the university in the wake of its merger with Queen Margaret College. The reason for this separation is that the GUU originally only permitted men to join, while the QMU only admitted women; in fact, the GUU was the last student union in the UK to have single-sex membership. In 1977, in the wake of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, there was a referendum to mix the two unions, but this was defeated by a large majority. A mixing campaign got seriously under way in 1979, at one point the strictly all-male \\"Beer Bar\\" being occupied by a large mixed group of students. An extraordinary general meeting of the QMU voted overwhelmingly to admit men into membership, a move which subverted the whole structure of separate unions. Eventually, in 1980, a GUU special general meeting voted overwhelmingly to admit women into membership, under threat from the University Court of losing the lease on the extension to its building, with just 139 votes against. Services Board of Management Unlike most student unions, the GUU has no sabbatical officers. Instead, the Union's affairs are controlled on behalf of the membership by a 26-member board of management, featuring 17 elected student positions, seven alumni positions and two ex-officio seats for the President of the Glasgow University Sports Association and the Past President.https://www.guu.co.uk/board-of-management The three-person executive committee is made up of the President, Honorary Secretary and Assistant Honorary Secretary. The President chairs the board and is responsible for special projects, external communications and external relations. The Honorary Secretary is responsible for day-to-day operations, membership experience and security & licensing matters, as well as organising flagship events such as Freshers' Week and Daft Friday. This is supported by the Assistant Honorary Secretary, who is also responsible for managing the board and supporting them in operating the Union, whilst also handling the Union's relationships with affiliated clubs and societies. The Executive liaise with the building management daily to organise operations, and are supported by two alumni Vice Presidents (each elected for two-year terms with one up for re-election each year) and the Honorary Treasurer, who provide strategic guidance. Four conveners operate below this, managing their own committees of Debates, Games, Libraries and Entertainments, made up of Union members, which organise regular events during term-time. Ten Present Student Members are elected, five per year on a two-year term, to represent the members and partake in operational committees ranging from PR to Student Welfare and Sustainability. Four Former Student Members provide a voice for the Union's alumni members as well as experience and support for the student members. Activities The GUU is a social hub for the university, providing the largest billiard hall in the West End, bars, live entertainment and a nightclub. It is one of the largest licensed premises in Scotland with nine bars (and a tenth which is portable for use during functions). In addition, members can eat in the Servery, which includes a Subway franchise, relax in the Drawing Room Coffee Shop (formerly the Smoking Room), purchase essentials in the Union Shop and take advantage of two libraries provided for study. \\"The objects of the Union shall be to maintain Reading, Writing and Dining Rooms, to promote social interaction among the members, to form a centre to which the various University Societies may be affiliated, and generally to fulfill the function of a Club for the members. The Union shall at all times remain an autonomous body with ultimate sovereignty vested in the members in General Meeting.\\" - GUU Constitution. The two libraries and the Reading Room, available for study and social events, are maintained by the Libraries Convener. The Elliot Library is named after former inter-war Cabinet Minister Walter Elliot; the Bridie Library after Osborne Mavor, physician, dramatist and founder of the Citizens Theatre, who wrote under the pseudonym, \\"James Bridie\\". A mural by Fyffe Christie hangs in the room, illustrating the West End Perk, a poem by Bridie. The Reading Room is dedicated to Donald Dewar, former President of the Union, Secretary of State for Scotland and First Minister of Scotland, and a portrait hangs there in his memory. Daft Friday After its impromptu initiation as a piano Sing-along and Smoking concert by the then Honorary Secretary Osborne Henry Mavor on the last day of the 1908 Martinmas Academic term, the highlight of the Union's social calendar is the annual 'Daft Friday' black tie ball which continues to be held at the end of the Martinmas term exam diet. Over the years the event has become increasingly elaborate with the entire union building decorated to a theme and devoted to the festivities. Daft Friday is held as a celebration for the president of the union. Over 2000 students attend the event, which includes revolves around a secret theme and hosts entertainments such as a swing band, string quartet, DJs, ceilidhs and laserquest. Well known bands have also played Daft Friday in recent years, including: Arcade Fire in 2008, Jack Penate in 2009, Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, Frightened Rabbit in 2011, Basshunter in 2012, Chvrches in 2013, Sub Focus in 2015, Gabrielle Aplin in 2016, Fickle Friends in 2017 and the Hoosiers in 2018. The evening also includes the James Bridie Memorial dinner; a seven course meal for around 150 guests. Speakers at the 2011 dinner included Charles Kennedy and David Ross, both of whom are former presidents of the union. Debating The GUU is one of the most successful university debating institutions in the world, winning the World Universities Debating Championships a record 5 times, the European University Debating Championships once and the John Smith Memorial Mace a record 16 times. The Convener of Debates on the GUU Board is elected from the Union membership and heads the Union Debates Committee. The current Convener of Debates is Bronagh Hughes. The Convener is responsible for the internal and intervarsity debating activities of the GUU. The Union's Debates Chamber spans the first and second floors of the building. The Union historically held the biennial John Smith Memorial Debate in memory of the former Leader of the Labour Party and former member of the union and Convener of Debates. The last of these was held in 2011, when guest speakers included Shadow Scottish Secretary Ann McKechin and former Conservative Health Minister Gerry Malone, and which was chaired by then Rector of the University and former leader of the Liberal Democrats Charles Kennedy. A bust of John Smith stands at the entrance to the Debates Chamber gallery. The Union currently holds a biennial Charles Kennedy Memorial Debate, the first having been held in 2015. In attendance at the inaugural memorial debate were: Alex Cole-Hamilton, subsequent Liberal Democrat MSP for Edinburgh Western; Alistair Darling, former Chancellor of the Exchequer and Labour MP for Edinburgh South West; Fiona Hyslop, SNP MSP for Linlithgow and Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs; Ian Duncan, Conservative MEP; Graham Stringer, Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton; and Alastair Campbell, former Director of Communications and Strategy at Number 10. The debate was chaired by Former President of the Union and former leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for North East Fife Sir Menzies Campbell. World Debating Anniversary To mark the 30th anniversary of the World Universities Debating Championships, which were founded by GUU, it held a Grand Show Debate on the subject of Scottish independence. This was held in the union on 19 November 2011. The debate featured eight of the union's ten former world champions and was chaired by the union president, Chris Sibbald. Speakers in the debate included: former ITN presenter John Nicolson, Managing Director of McKinsey & Company UK and Ireland Kevin Sneader, Royal Bank of Scotland Global Head of Equities Frank McKirgan, Gillette Chief Marketing Officer and Vice President of Procter & Gamble Austin Lally, now President of Braun and a member of the P&G; Global Leadership Council, advocate Manus Blessing, Managing Director of Bain Capital Robin Marshall, former MSP, Duncan Hamilton, and entrepreneur Gordon Peterson. Over two hundred of the union's distinguished alumni turned out for the event, including: former leader of the Liberal Democrats Charles Kennedy; former Conservative Minister of Health Gerald Malone; Channel Four Business Correspondent Sarah Smith; Labour peers Lord James Gordon and Baroness Smith, wife of former Leader of the Opposition and friend of the union, John Smith; Lord Justice Clerk Lord Gill; football commentator Archie Macpherson and comedian Len Murray. The debate motion of \\"This House believes in an Independent Scotland\\", a controversial issue in current British politics, was hotly contested and resulted in a win for the 1987 World Champion team of Kevin Sneader and Austin Lally. They won a memorable Worlds tournament in UCD in 1987 of 110 teams. The Best Speaker prize was awarded to Duncan Hamilton. The debate garnered national press attention and was filmed live and broadcast internationally by STV. STV's political editor Bernard Ponsonby covered the event. Inter-Varsity Debating The GUU has an established record of international debating success and prominence. It hosted the first World Universities Debating Championship in its current form in 1981 and again in 1990 and 2001. The Union won the Championship five times, in 1983, 1987, 1992, 1994 and 1997. In addition, the GUU has a distinguished history in the John Smith Memorial Mace, a competition between the winners of regional competitions in Ireland, England, Scotland and, latterly, Wales. It currently holds the record for the most overall wins with a total of sixteen. In more recent years, the GUU has regularly reached the advanced stages of both the World and European Universities Debating Championships, in addition to winning several domestic UK competitions. The Union most recently made the World Universities Debating Championships Finals in Chennai 2014 and, with a team of Bethany Garry and Owen Mooney, won the European Universities Debating Championship for the first time in August 2017. Parliamentary Debating The Union is notable for its five annual Parliamentary Debates. This format is unique to the Union, involving an Afternoon Session and an Evening Session of five rounds each. GUU Parliamentaries are not to be confused with the British Parliamentary style of debating. Parliamentary debates currently involve five (fictitious) clubs: the Scottish Nationalist Association, Her Majesty's Loyal Tory Club, the Whigs Club, the Independent Socialists and The World Almighty Distributist League. During Parliamentary debates, speakers are referred to by Parliamentary names, assigned to them akin to \\"constituencies\\", but usually of a humorous nature. Some members join clubs to which they are politically aligned; others join clubs for social reasons or for competitive reasons, hoping to be selected by that club's leader to deliver speeches during desirable rounds of the debate. In each year, the clubs rotate roles, as the \\"Government\\", \\"Opposition\\", Strong Support, Strong Opposition, and Weak Support/Opposition. The Government presents a Bill containing a preamble and three clauses, which is then argued over the course of about nine hours of debate, concluded by the \\"Prime Minister\\" who typically gives a speech of between thirty and sixty minutes to sum up the debate. The debate is judged by the Clerks Bench, consisting of the Clerk to the House, the Deputy Clerk, and three Assistant Clerks. The current Clerk to the House is Robyn Lawrence and the Deputy Clerks are Blake Gray and Owain Campton. The scores are revealed during the last (and longest) debate. In addition to the Club Championship, individual prizes are awarded to the Best Speaker, Most Promising Speaker, Best Maiden Speaker. There are two additional prizes, the Frederick Richters Cup for best performing speaker for whom English is their Second Language and the John Morrison \\"Hobbit\\" Prize for outstanding contributions to the GUU debating community. Each Parliamentary Debate has a theme and the order is usually as follows: The President's Debate (dedicated to the President of the Union), The Secretary's Debate (dedicated to the Board of Management of the GUU), The Dialectic Debate (dedicated to the Dialectic Society), The Old Hacks debate (where graduates and former members of the House return for a dedicated additional round) and the Guests Debate (where members of other debating institutions are invited to participate in the \\"Guest Round\\"). The Club Leaders for 2019-20 are: * Scottish Nationalist Association - Manon Minassian * Her Majesty's Loyal Tory Club - Sajid Chowdhury * The Whig Club - Julie Nyerges * Independent Socialists - Katie Sawers * The World Almighty Distributist League - Benedict Anslow Dialectic Society The Glasgow University Dialectic Society was the original debating society for students at the University, thought to have originated from some time around the University's foundation in 1451 but re-instituted in 1861. The Dialectic Society was one of the organisations which contributed to the establishment of the union in 1885 and continues to be involved in the debating activities of the union, whilst retaining an independent status. The GUU Convenor of Debates is an ex officio member of the Board of the Dialectic Society, and the third Parliamentary of the year is dedicated the Dialectic Parliamentary. Entertainment The union offers an regular entertainments and competitions for members and non-members. Open Mic runs on a Friday evening from 9pm in The Well along with a number of occasional events such as comedy nights and 'GUU's Got Talent'. The Union currently runs two club nights in The Hive - HIVE Thursdays and Switch Saturday. Games The Games Convener was originally charged with ensuring that the tables in the union's Billiard room were kept to a good standard. The Games Committee now runs free weekly events as well as the annual 'Month of Games'. Weekly events include the Beer Bar Quiz (Mondays at 8pm), Snooker Competition (Wednesdays), Darts and Pool Competitions (Fridays) and annual events comprise snooker and darts competitions, a dodgeball tournament, drinking and Iron Stomach competitions and B.A.D.G.E. (Big All Day Games Event). Closure of The Hive In the autumn of 2011, it emerged that the university was considering proposals to demolish the union's extension building and replace it with increased sports facilities. The union's extension building housed five of the union's bars and its nightclub, The Hive. The reaction to these proposals was met with anger among the student population, particularly as loss of the union's nightclub, would result in the closure of the union. As a result, the union Board of Management campaigned and lobbied the university senior management group, which resulted in national press attention. Many of the union's alumni reacted to the news of this decision with Duncan Hamilton saying: \\"This is a total failure to appreciate that for many alumni the GUU was the most influential and important part of their university life.\\" As a result, the university abandoned its original proposals; rather, opting for a joint-venture for union and sports facilities. University of Glasgow principal Professor Anton Muscatelli issued a statement saying: \\"The University will only commit the Sports Extension when we are also able to commit to a development of GUU social space that will sustain its activities.\\" This was ultimately achieved, with construction of a new extension building starting in June 2014 and completed in September 2015. The Board of Management of 2015‚àí16, along with the Union's General Manager Anne Marie Bennett, formally opened the Hive on 17 October 2015. Friends of Glasgow University Union Friends of Glasgow University Union (FoGUU) was formed in 2011 as an independent charity to raise funds for projects at Glasgow University Union. A committee of various life members runs FoGUU and meets on a monthly basis. The committee seeks monthly donations from alumni, with patrons' names being displayed in a Patrons' Board in the union. FoGUU runs activities for life members, including: reunion dinners, golf days and anniversary events. The charity is an extension of the committee that the union's 125th celebrations in October 2010. This culminated in a dinner for over two hundred alumni, hosted by broadcaster, and former union board member, Andrew Neil. Controversy In March 2013, two female debaters visiting the university from Edinburgh and Cambridge for the GUU Ancients Debating Championship complained of incidents of sexist heckling and misogynistic objectification by a number of GUU members. The University's Senate launched disciplinary proceedings against two students, holding a hearing before finding there was \\"no case to answer\\". As a result of a separate inquiry launched by the University Union into sexism in its community, conducted by Professor Noreen Burrows, Sandra White MSP and Dr Roddy Neilsonhttp://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/029351_f7d526f7fbf64b9cb88eec3d4f81af7d.pdf, the GUU introduced a new Equality and Diversity policy, Harassment and Bullying policy and Complaints Procedure and made several changes to its Constitution. As part of its response to the culture of sexism identified in the report, the GUU also became the first debating Union in Scotland to introduce diversity quotas, directed towards the increased participation of women in competitions. As a result of these policies, the GUU fielded the team to the European University Debating Championships that contained the first woman to win the competition and be named Best Open Speaker.

This party was inspired by the Nazi ideology. In 1971, he and Beattie disrupted the Social Credit Party of Canada national convention when they refused to leave. Their memberships in the party had been revoked by the party's executive council because their presence was \\"inimical to the interests of the party\\". Yelling that the party would have to \\"bring in storm troopers\\" to get them out, they disrupted the party's public affairs workshop, and the whole convention.

Though he denied contributing anything financially to the plot, he admitted in an interview that he was \\"involved with the idea of Dominica since the middle of '79,\\" wanting to create a colony for \\"all pure whites - Aryan stock, physically as well as mentally.\\" Later activities In the 1990s, Weiche worked with the Nationalist Party of Canada's Don Andrews in an attempt to have municipalities recognize \\"European Heritage Week\\" following up from a successful 1995 attempt to have London, Ontario recognize \\"European Heritage Day\\". Weiche filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission when the city rejected Weiche's proposal.Canada Weiche made his fortune as a developer and, in 2000, was reported by Now Magazine to be a major financial backer of far-right leader Paul Fromm.

Laeisz of Hamburg.  History  The company was founded in 1824 by Ferdinand Laeisz as a hat manufacturing company. He was quite successful and distributed his hats even in South America. In 1839, he had the three-masted wooden brig Carl (named after his son) built and entered the shipping business, but lack of success made him sell the ship a short five years later. Ferdinand's son Carl Laeisz entered the business in 1852. It was he who turned the F. Laeisz company into a shipping business. In 1857, they ordered a barque which they named Pudel (which was the nickname of Carl's wife Sophie), and from the mid-1880s on, all their ships had names starting with \\"P\\" and they became known as \\"the P-line\\". The last ship without a \\"P-name\\" was the wooden barque Henriette Behn which was stranded on the Mexican coast in 1885.W. Laas: Die grossen Segelschiffe: Ihre Entwickelung und Zukunft, Springer Verlag 1908. (ex-Padua) under sail The Laeisz company specialized in the South American nitrate trade. Their ships were built for speed, and they soon acquired an excellent reputation for timeliness and reliability, which gave rise to the nickname \\"the Flying P-Line\\". The five-masted barque made the voyage from Chile to England around Cape Horn in 1904 in just 57 days, a record at the time. The Laeisz company had some of the largest sailing ships ever built. They experimented with steel-hulled five-masters, first the barque Potosi (1895) and in 1902 the huge full-rigged ship with a length of , , and over . She could sail faster than and her best 24-hour distance was 392 sm in 1908 on her voyage to Yokohama. However, these ships turned out to be too big: their crews did not like them, and it became increasingly difficult to achieve a satisfactory utilization on the outbound leg from Europe to Chile. The later ships, such as or , returned to being smaller four-masted barques. During World War I, many of Laeisz' ships were blocked in Chilean ports and had to be handed over as war reparations. However, the Laeisz company was able to re- acquire many ships after the war and put them into service again. Towards the end of the 1920s, the company began pulling out of the nitrate trade and increasingly started transporting other goods, e.g. bananas. They also sold some of their older ships, for instance to Gustav Erikson in Finland who already had acquired the former Norddeutscher Lloyd-ship . The last sailing ship ordered by the Laeisz company was in 1926. Subsequently, the Laeisz company only ordered steamships.

Forest & Bird consists of 47 branches located in urban and rural centres throughout New Zealand. Branches are actively engaged in conservation projects and advocacy on a community, regional and national basis. Forest & Bird has offices and staff located in Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, Nelson and Dunedin. Forest & Bird publishes a quarterly magazine Forest & Bird, one of New Zealand's definitive natural history and conservation publications. Forest & Bird has published a comprehensive commentary book on environmental law in New Zealand. Forest & Bird are also actively engaged in advocating and lobbying for resource management law and practices to more consistently protect ecosystems.  History  The Forest and Bird logo that was in use until November 2009. The society was founded in 1923, as the Native Bird Protection Society. Later renamed as the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand, it has consistently advocated conservation issues, particularly for forested land. Val Sanderson is acknowledged as the founder of Forest and Bird. In 1921, after his return from the First World War, the then Captain Val Sanderson was angered that the Kapiti Island wildlife reserve was unfenced and extensively damaged by cattle, sheep and goats. Sanderson campaigned for better management of Kapiti Island and succeeded in having it re-dedicated as a Wildlife Reserve. After this success, Sanderson held a public meeting in March 1923 which established the Native Bird Protection Society with Sir Thomas Mackenzie as the Society's first President. The New Zealand Forestry League, a forest conservation group already existed but it gradually died out. In 1935 Mackenzie and Sanderson renamed the society the Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand. Sanderson drove an expansion of the society's range of interests into such areas as soil erosion and use of native trees for soil stabilisation. He became the president in 1933 a position which he held until his death in 1945 aged 79. Until the 1970s, the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society remained the only New Zealand environmental group. However, in October 1971 the New Zealand Government proposed to harvest large areas of native South Island lowland beech forest with half the cleared area to be converted to exotic Pinus radiata. Along with the Save Manapouri campaign, the native forest harvesting prompted more public awareness of conservation and the formation of new environmental groups such as the Beech Forest Action Committee. In response to the native forest harvesting, on 4 July 1975 Forest & Bird and Beech Forest Action Committee started the Maruia Declaration as a public petition demanding an end to native forest logging and legal recognition of native forests. The Maruia Declaration was submitted to the New Zealand Government in 1977. From 2005 the society has held an annual poll Bird of the Year, voted on by the public.Birds battle again in annual poll. 3 News NZ. 30 September 2013.

Attitudes  Former National Office building in Wellington, now at 205 Victoria Street Perceptions on Forest & Bird are varied. While the group is one of the most well-known mainstream environmental groups of the country, it has also come under criticism, such as in 2010 when Prime Minister John Key accused them of engaging in \\"predictable scaremongering\\" when the group warned that a yet unreleased government report proposed to allow mining in 7000ha of high-value conservation land in Paparoa National Park, Great Barrier Island and the Coromandel Peninsula. Key also labelled news coverage quoting Forest and Bird's revelations of the Government's intentions for mining conservation land as \\"hysterical\\". A week later, as predicted by Forest and Bird, the Government released the \\"Schedule 4 stocktake\\" proposal to open up 7058 hectares of protected conservation land for mining. Parts of the Coromandel Peninsula, Great Barrier Island, and parts of Paparoa National Park were proposed for removal from Schedule Four of the Crown Minerals Act 1991, which otherwise prevents mining. Journalist John Armstrong commented that \\"Forest and Bird knocked the Government sideways with leaked information revealing the extent of National's plans to open up land currently off limits to mining companies\\" and that the Government was suffering from hysteria if any one was. After 40,000 people marched in Auckland in protest against the proposal, and after the vast majority of 37,552 public submissions opposed the proposal, the Government announced that no conservation land would be removed from Schedule 4 to allow mining.

According to the , it has a population of people. The city was formed in the year 2000 by the merging of Bacon and Sorsogon towns. The city's total population spread across 64 barangays. It serves a trans-shipment point from the Visayas and Mindanao provinces, and is dubbed as the \\"Gateway to Southern Philippines\\". Sorsogon City is one of the region's leading cities in urbanization and the most promising city in terms of development. History Evidence of human habitation come from 3,000-year old remains in a cave in Bacon and ancient burial sites dug upstream of Sorsogon rivers. Spanish missionaries came upon settlements in both sites when they arrived in the 1600s. Moro pirates had already frequented the territorial waters before the arrival of the Spanish missions. Bacon was established as a visita of Casiguran while Sorsogon, originally in Sitio Pocdol in Capuy, was then established as a visita of Bacon. Sorsogon then became an independent, full- fledged parish in 1628 due to an increase in population. The two parishes later became civilian political units. The Pueblo Civil de Bacon was established in 1754, with Juan Elias as its first gobernadorcillo. Sorsogon became an independent pueblo in 1864. Both Bacon and Sorsogon were under the territorial jurisdiction of the province of Albay until the establishment of the independent province of Sorsogon on October 17, 1894. Foundation Sorsogon City was created by virtue of Republic Act No. 8806 which was enacted on August 16, 2000, and ratified in December 2000. Geography Sorsogon City covers a land area of .

Filmed on location in the Purcell Mountains in British Columbia, the film was directed by Frank Marshall, written by John Patrick Shanley, and narrated by John Malkovich. It features an ensemble cast including Ethan Hawke, Josh Hamilton, Vincent Spano, Bruce Ramsay, John Haymes Newton, Illeana Douglas, and Danny Nucci. One of the survivors, Nando Parrado (portrayed by Hawke in the film), served as the technical advisor for the film.  Plot  The film opens with a group of photographs of the Stella Maris College's Old Christians Rugby Team. Carlitos P√°ez points out several members of the team and reflects on the accident in a brief monologue. Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 flies over the Andes on October 13, 1972. The raucous rugby players and a few of their relatives and friends are eagerly looking forward to an upcoming match in Chile. Upon emerging from clouds, the plane encounters turbulence and collides with a mountain. The wings and tail are separated from the fuselage, which slides down a mountain slope before coming to a stop. Six passengers and one flight attendant are ejected from the plane and die. Antonio, the team captain, coordinates efforts to help the injured. Roberto Canessa and Gustavo Zerbino, both medical students, aid the injured. Another six passengers soon die, including both pilots and Nando's mother, Eugenia. Nando, who sustained a head injury, falls into a coma, and his sister Susana has suffered harsh internal injuries. As the sun sets, the survivors make preparations for the night. Canessa discovers that the seat covers can be unzipped and used as blankets. The survivors go inside the fuselage and curl up beside one another to stay warm. Antonio, Roy Harley, and Rafael Cano plug the gaping hole at the end of the fuselage with luggage to keep out the wind. Two passengers die overnight. With nothing to hunt or gather on the mountain, Antonio declares they will use rationing when the survivors find a tin of chocolates and a case of wine. After seeing a plane fly past, they think it dips its wing, and the survivors celebrate. Expecting to be rescued the next day, everyone except Javier, his wife Liliana, and Antonio eat the remaining chocolates. This causes a quarrel among Antonio and several others. Nando regains consciousness. After learning of his mother's death, Nando watches over Susana vigilantly. Knowing she will die of her injuries within a few days, he vows to set off on foot and find a way out of the mountains. When Carlitos reminds him that he will need food, Nando suggests eating the flesh of the deceased pilots to give him the strength to survive the journey to find help. Susana dies from her injuries. The survivors listen to a radio for word of their rescue but are devastated to hear the search called off after nine days. After great debate, the starving passengers decide to eat the flesh of their dead relatives and friends. Zerbino, Rafael, and Juan Martino set off to search for the tail of the plane in hopes of finding batteries for the plane's radio to transmit their location. Among pieces of the wreckage, the teammates find additional corpses, but return to the group with news that the tail of the plane is likely a little farther away. Later in the week, an avalanche strikes the plane and fills much of the interior with snow. Eight of the survivors are smothered by the snow or freeze to death. A second team, made up of Nando, Canessa, and Antonio \\"Tintin\\" Vizintin, sets out and find the tail of the plane. Unable to bring the batteries to the fuselage, they return to the fuselage to get Roy, who is thought to have experience with electrical equipment. They bring him to the tail of the plane to see whether he can fix the radio. When Roy is unsuccessful, the team returns to the fuselage. Federico and Alberto die from their injuries, as does Rafael, leading Nando to convince a reluctant Canessa to search for a way out of the mountains, taking Tintin with them. Two days into the journey, they send Tintin back to the fuselage so they can appropriate his rations and continue on their own. After a 12-day trek, the two escape the mountains and alert the authorities of their companions' location. As helicopters land on the mountain, the remaining 14 survivors celebrate. In the present, Carlitos describes how the survivors later returned to the site of the crash and buried the corpses under a pile of stones, marked with a cross. The memorial to the 29 deceased and 16 survivors is shown.  Cast  The names of the people who died in the disaster were changed for the film. There were three key exceptions: Eugenia and Susana Parrado (Nando Parrado's mother and sister, respectively), and Liliana Methol (Javier Methol's wife).  Survivors   Deceased   Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 59% of 27 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.17/10. David Ansen of Newsweek said that, while, \\"Piers Paul Read's acclaimed book ... paid special attention to the social structure that evolved among the group ... Marshall ... downplays the fascinating sociological details‚Äîand the ambiguities of character‚Äîin favor of action, heroism and a vague religiosity that's sprinkled over the story like powdered sugar.\\" Others, such as Ray Green, praised the tactful nature of the film stating that, \\"despite the potential for lurid sensationalism, Marshall manages to keep his and the film's dignity by steering an effectively downbeat course through some grim goings on thanks in no small manner to the almost allegorical ring of Stanley's stylized dialogue.\\"Green, Ray. \\"Alive.\\" Box Office (March 1993). Green continues by describing the film as, \\"thrilling and engrossing as it is at times, Alive is more than an action film‚Äîin its own way it is also a drama of ideas, and of the human spirit as well.\\" Roger Ebert wrote \\"There are some stories you simply can't tell. The story of the Andes survivors may be one of them.\\" He also questioned the realism of how normal the actors' bodies looked after portraying two months of near starvation.  Documentary  A companion documentary, Alive: 20 Years Later, was released at the same time as the film. It includes interviews with the survivors, as well as documentary footage of the rescue. The 30th Anniversary Edition of Alive: The Miracle of the Andes (on DVD) includes this documentary in the Extras section.

History Foundation At the time of the New Zealand Party's foundation in 1983, the Prime Minister was Robert Muldoon. Muldoon was a social conservative but also a strong believer in the need for state intervention in the economy, claiming that only with government involvement could New Zealand be prosperous. In accordance with his economic theories, Muldoon introduced the so-called \\"Think Big\\" program, which saw massive overseas borrowing to finance large government construction projects. Later, as New Zealand's economy declined and its deficit increased, Muldoon introduced wage and price controls. Bob Jones, a self-made millionaire and author, strongly opposed these policies, comparing them to what he had recently observed in the Soviet bloc. In a number of newspaper opinion pieces, Jones spoke out against the government, claiming that the National Party had betrayed its principles of individual liberty and free enterprise. For example, Jones advocated a flat tax, while the top rate at the time was 66%. Since Jones had previously been a strong supporter of the National Party and a personal friend of Muldoon, his attacks on the government marked an end to both associations. Jones attracted considerable attention with his comments. Although he had not originally considered it, a number of people encouraged him to start a new political party. Jones himself believed that a new party could conceivably split the National Party's vote, bringing the government down. Jones appears to have hoped that losing an election would help to purge the National Party of \\"Muldoonism\\". Along with some of the people who had contacted him about the matter, Jones began to lay the foundations for a new organization. The party's name and motto were chosen, and its primary policies were set out. When Muldoon heard of Jones's plans, he initially dismissed them as a hoax, saying that the rumours were a publicity stunt by Jones. The comments galvanized Jones and his supporters into action, and it was decided to officially launch the new party on 22 August. The launch, which coincided with the release of the party's manifesto, was well covered by the media, and the New Zealand Party gained considerable public recognition. Not long after it was founded, some polls showed the party with nearly 20% of the vote. Early days The policies established by the New Zealand Party differed substantially from those of most of the country's other parties. Perhaps its most well-known views related to economic matters, particularly the liberalization of the economy and the adoption of laissez-faire principles. The party also, however, put forward a number of other significant proposals. One example was the party's unorthodox defence policy, which advocated a large reduction in military expenditure and the abandonment of New Zealand's defence links with Australia and the United States (particularly the ANZUS alliance). Jones himself favoured the total abolition of New Zealand's armed forces, but that was considered too radical to be adopted as New Zealand Party policy. While the New Zealand Party attracted considerable support, it also attracted a considerable amount of criticism Muldoon labeled the party \\"greedies\\", pointing to Jones's personal wealth and to the fact that much of the party's support came from the richer sections of society. The party was also attacked by left-wing groups, which objected to its support of free market economics. Both Muldoon and left-wing groups claimed that the New Zealand Party was out of touch with ordinary New Zealanders. In addition, the party also struggled to shake off the perception that it was \\"the Bob Jones Party\\" and not a full- fledged political movement. Jones himself was sometimes criticised for his blunt and \\"politically incorrect\\" style, but others found it refreshing. Other prominent figures within the New Zealand Party included Janie Pearce (the deputy leader), Josephine Grierson (an economic policy specialist), and Gordon Dryden. Dryden, whose views often clashed with those of other party members, was highly charismatic, and gained a substantial following within the party. In May 1984, he left the party after a major disagreement with Jones. 1984 election When Muldoon unexpectedly called an early election, the New Zealand Party was caught by surprise and had only a month to prepare its campaign. Opinion polls gave a mixed view of the party's strength. Some gave it up to 20% of the vote, but others gave it only around 2-3%. Perhaps unwisely, the party did not decide to focus on specific seats, but instead spread its efforts equally across the country. On election day, the New Zealand Party failed to win any seats. New Zealand then used the plurality voting system, which made it hard for third parties to gain representation in Parliament. The party gained second place in several electorates, and gained third place in many more. However, its votes were dispersed, rather than concentrated in any one area, so it was unable to enter Parliament. In total, the New Zealand Party gained 12.2% of the vote, putting it in third place. The Social Credit Party, although winning only 7.6% of the vote, won two seats, probably as the result of having specifically focused its attention on them since the 1950s. While its failure to win seats was a major disappointment to the New Zealand Party, it took comfort in the fact that it likely caused the defeat of the government. The opposition Labour Party soundly defeated Muldoon and the National Party, and many commentators believe that the New Zealand Party played a major role in drawing voters away from National. Once in power, the Labour Party (prompted by Finance Minister Roger Douglas) actually adopted many of the New Zealand Party's economic policies, much to the resentment of traditional Labour supporters. Indeed, Douglas even wanted a flat tax, but was stymied by the Labour Prime Minister David Lange. Shortly after the election, the National Party dropped Muldoon as leader and eventually came to embrace free market economics as well. Decline After the election, the New Zealand Party quickly deteriorated as a significant political force. Jones, his primary objective of ending the Muldoon government having been accomplished, and disappointed by the Party's electoral performance in the 1985 Timaru by-election, unilaterally made a decision to put the Party into recess. He later said that with the \\"Rogernomics\\" reforms being undertaken by the new administration, he considered his party to be redundant. A few other prominent figures, most notably Party President Malcolm McDonald, also left the party at this stage. Not surprisingly, many in the Party's ranks considered Jones' move to put the party into recess without reference to Party Members to be undemocratic and, despite Jones' opposition, proceeded to hold the scheduled annual conference in July 1985. At that conference, delegates elected John Galvin, a dairy farmer from Matamata, as Party Leader. In 1986, with its policy platform largely implemented by a reforming Labour Government, beset by funding problems and falling support, the New Zealand Party opted to \\"merge\\" into the National Party as an attempt to keep its strong free enterprise and libertarian philosophy alive. The merger was overshadowed by a leadership coup in National that occurred the same day. However, the name \\"New Zealand Party\\" continued to be used by some individuals beyond that point as a Rump party. Galvin was replaced as leader with Stephen Greenfield, the Managing Director of a travel company, who led the remaining party members who opposed the merger with National. Greenfield (who stood in ) led the remaining New Zealand Party in the which saw a huge drop in support. Eventually the remaining members of the party ended up as part of a supposedly centrist party known as the New Zealand Coalition after joining together with fragments of Social Credit and the United NZ Party. Some commentators see the modern ACT New Zealand party as being the successor of the New Zealand Party, and Bob Jones is counted among ACT's supporters. Not everyone would agree with the link, however, and there are a number of notable differences in policy between the two. For example, ACT's foreign and defence policies are directly contrary to New Zealand Party policy, with ACT advocating increased defence expenditure and the strengthening of traditional alliances. ACT has never won as many votes as the New Zealand Party gained in 1984. Electoral results { wikitable style=text-align:center !

A typical western bedroom contains as bedroom furniture one or two beds (ranging from a crib for an infant, a single or twin bed for a toddler, child, teenager, or single adult to bigger sizes like a full, double, queen, king or California king [eastern or waterbed size for a couple]), a clothes closet, and bedside table and dressing table, both of which usually contain drawers. Except in bungalows, ranch style homes, or one-storey motels, bedrooms are usually on one of the floors of a dwelling that is above ground level. History Illustration of a bedroom from France Bedroom in Arles, by Vincent van Gogh in October 1888, at the Van Gogh Museum of Amsterdam In larger Victorian houses it was common to have accessible from the bedroom a boudoir for the lady of the house and a dressing room for the gentleman.Yorke, Trevor (2005) The Victorian House Explained. Newbury: Countryside Books ; p. 105 Attic bedrooms exist in some houses; since they are only separated from the outside air by the roof they are typically cold in winter and may be too hot in summer. The slope of the rafters supporting a pitched roof also makes them inconvenient. In houses where servants were living in they often used attic bedrooms. In the 14th century the lower class slept on mattresses that were stuffed with hay and broom straws. During the 16th century mattresses stuffed with feathers started to gain popularity, with those who could afford them. The common person was doing well if he could buy a mattress after seven years of marriage. In the 18th century cotton and wool started to become more common. The first coil spring mattress was not invented until 1871. The most common and most purchased mattress is the innerspring mattress, though a wide variety of alternative materials are available including foam, latex, wool, and even silk. The variety of firmness choices range from relatively soft to a rather firm mattress. A bedroom may have bunk beds if two or more people share a room. A chamber pot kept under the bed or in a nightstand was usual in the period before modern domestic plumbing and bathrooms in dwellings. Furnishings Bedroom from New York City Bedroom at night in Puigcerd√† (Cerdanya, Girona, Spain) Illustration of a bedroom from the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg (Russia) Furniture and other items in bedrooms vary greatly, depending on taste, local traditions and the socioeconomic status of an individual. For instance, a master bedroom may include a bed of a specific size (double, king or queen-sized); one or more dressers (or perhaps, a wardrobe armoire); a nightstand; one or more closets; and carpeting. Built-in closets are less common in Europe than in North America; thus there is greater use of freestanding wardrobes or armoires in Europe. An individual's bedroom is a reflection of their personality, as well as social class and socioeconomic status, and is unique to each person. However, there are certain items that are common in most bedrooms. Mattresses usually have a bed set to raise the mattress off the floor and the bed often provides some decoration. There are many different types of mattresses. Night stands are also popular. They are used to put various items on, such as an alarm clock or a small lamp. In the times before bathrooms existed in dwellings bedrooms often contained a washstand for tasks of personal hygiene. In the 2010s, having a television set in a bedroom is fairly common as well. 43% of American children from ages 3 to 4 have a television in their bedrooms. Along with television sets many bedrooms also have computers, video game consoles, and a desk to do work. In the late 20th century and early 21st century the bedroom became a more social environment and people started to spend a lot more time in their bedrooms than in the past. Bedding used in northern Europe (especially in Scandinavia) is significantly different from that used in North America and other parts of Europe. In Japan futons are common. In addition to a bed (or, if shared by two or more children, a bunk bed), a child's bedroom may include a small closet or dressers, a toy box or computer game console, bookcase or other items. Modern bedrooms A modern Western bedroom in Australia A hotel bedroom in Venice Many houses in North America have at least two bedrooms‚Äîusually a primary bedroom and one or more bedrooms for either the children or guests. In some jurisdictions there are basic features (such as a closet and a \\"means of egress\\") that a room must have in order to legally qualify as a bedroom. In many states, such as Alaska, bedrooms are not required to have closets and must instead meet minimum size requirements. A closet by definition is a small space used to store things. In a bedroom, a closet is most commonly used for clothes and other small personal items that one may have. Walk in closets are more popular today and vary in size. However, in the past wardrobes have been the most prominent. A wardrobe is a tall rectangular shaped cabinet that clothes can be stored or hung in. Clothes are also kept in a dresser. Typically nicer clothes are kept in the closet because they can be hung up while leisure clothing and undergarments are stored in the dresser. In buildings with multiple self-contained housing units (e.g., apartments), the number of bedrooms varies widely. While many such units have at least one bedroom‚Äîfrequently, these units have at least two‚Äîsome of these units may not have a specific room dedicated for use as a bedroom. (These units may be known by various names, including studio, efficiency, bedsit, and others.) Sometimes, a primary bedroom is connected to a dedicated bathroom, often called an ensuite. Culture Bedrooms typically have a door for privacy (in some cases lockable from inside) and a window for ventilation. In larger bedrooms, a small desk and chair or an upholstered chair and a chest of drawers may also be used. In Western countries, some large bedrooms, called master bedrooms, may also contain a bathroom. Where space allows bedrooms may also have televisions and / or video players, and in some cases a personal computer. Around the world  Japan  In Japan, the notion of having a bedroom is much less important than it is in the west, especially as it pertains to having a private space for personal use. Indeed, having a unified house corresponds to having a unified family, a concept so important that areas are seldom personalized, even those pertaining to relationships. Everything is subject to the concept of primitive cohesion. This makes for flexibility in terms of the way various spaces are utilized: \\"Individual spaces are constantly changing; one does not always sleep in the same room nor the same place.\\" Espaces domestiques, p. 214. Each evening, the Japanese unroll their futon directly on their tatami mats, typically close to one another. They then put them away come morning in the oshiire. The unity of the household is also reinforced by the use of sliding partitions (shoji) lined with rice paper and insulating in every way. Materially, the Japanese tatami room, as opposed to its western counterpart (deemed The Western Room), has no door, bed, or even wall, making it barely detectable in space. This room is typically situated towards the back of the home, close to the place dedicated to the family ancestors and opposite of the southern facade, the gardens, and the general exterior. The second half of the twentieth century saw a considerable change in the bedroom style. Almost non-existent before World War Two, The Western Room continued to gain traction in new constructions to the point where there is a clear relationship between age of a building and presence of western-style bedrooms. Cultural habits, however, have not shifted as rapidly. In the most densely-populated cities, there exists a type of hotel essentially consisting of stacks of individual \\"rooms\\" so cramped they hardly allow one to do more than lie down and sleep.

It is now found in many parts of the world, being exported to Canada in 1853, the US in 1882 and Australia in 1951. The breed enjoyed success during the 1950s but this subsided during the foot and mouth crisis. Today, the breed is enjoying a revival due to the demands of the beef market. The breed is considered average size and has a thick coat due to the climate of their native Scotland.  Etymology  Galloway is an ancient region located in the south-west of Scotland. The word 'Galloway' is derived from the words Gallovid, or Gallg√°edil.  History  The Galloway breed comes from the cattle native to the south-west region of Scotland, first fully developed in the 17th century. Originally there was much variation within this breed, including many different colours and patterns. The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle, but the recessive gene for red colour persisted in the population, and eventually dun Galloways were also allowed into the herd book. As a result, although black is still the most common colour for Galloways, they can also be red and several shades of dun. In 1877 the Galloway Cattle Society was formed. The Galloway was introduced in Canada in 1853, first registered in 1872, and the first Galloway registry was introduced in the United States in 1882. In 1911, 35,000 cattle were registered in the American Galloway Herd Book which was first created in 1882. The British Galloway Society formed in 1908. They did not recognise dun coloured Galloway cattle, which was met with outrage and this ban was later lifted. In 1951, Galloway cattle were introduced to Australia. In the 1950s the breed enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input (feed) cattle with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (commonly referred to as mad cow disease) caused an export ban in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle. This created a fear associated with cattle, so breed numbers declined. Recent years have seen changes as bigger leaner carcasses were demanded. This issue of size featured in Galloway circles causes great debate. Some of the adjustments made was the adoption of AI and Embryo Transfer. Today the breed's original characteristics are now back in demand. This is due to the demand of high quality meat that requires economical production.  Characteristics  The average Galloway cow will weigh 1000 to 1500 pounds and the average bull weighing 1700 to 2300 pounds. The healthy birth weight for a calf is 75 pounds. Galloways have a thick double-layered coat that is wavy or curly. This thick coat of hair insulates their bodies so well that they have a minimal outer layer of fat on their bodies, which would otherwise create waste at slaughter. This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates. Despite the animal's usual use in beef production, there is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production. The Galloway is naturally hornless, and instead of horns has a bone knob at the top of its skull called the poll. This breed's shaggy coat has both a thick, woolly undercoat for warmth and stiffer guard hairs that help shed water, making them well adapted to harsher climates.  Population  It is thought that the breed count is lower than 10,000 cattle worldwide, most of them in Northern Europe, specifically Scotland. The breed is 'rare' in the United States and the Livestock Conservancy classifies it as a breed to 'watch'.

Structure Sublingual caruncles highlighted on either side of the frenulum Lying superior to the digastric muscles, each submandibular gland is divided into superficial and deep lobes, which are separated by the mylohyoid muscle:Human Anatomy, Jacobs, Elsevier, 2008, page 196 * The superficial lobe comprises most of the gland, with the mylohyoid muscle runs under it * The deep lobe is the smaller part Secretions are delivered into the submandibular duct on the deep portion after which they hook around the posterior edge of the mylohyoid muscle and proceed on the superior surface laterally. The excretory ducts are then crossed by the lingual nerve, and ultimately drain into the sublingual caruncles ‚Äì small prominences on either side of the lingual frenulum along with the major sublingual duct. The gland can be bilaterally palpated (felt) inferior and posterior to the body of the mandible, moving inward from the inferior border of the mandible near its angle with the head tilted forwards.Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, p. 155 Microanatomy acini, at the left a group of serous acini. Lobes contain smaller lobules, which contain adenomeres, the secretory units of the gland. Each adenomere contains one or more acini, or alveoli, which are small clusters of cells that secrete their products into a duct. The acini of each adenomere are composed of either serous or mucous cells, with serous adenomeres predominating. Some mucous adenomeres may also be capped with a serous demilune, a layer of lysozyme- secreting serous cells resembling a half moon. Like other exocrine glands, the submandibular gland can be classified by the microscopic anatomy of its secretory cells and how they are arranged. Because the glands are branched, and because the tubules forming the branches contain secretory cells, submandibular glands are classified as branched tubuloacinar glands. Further, because the secretory cells are of both serous and mucous types, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and though most of the cells are serous, the exudate is chiefly mucous. It has long striated ducts and short intercalated ducts.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 135 The secretory acinar cells of the submandibular gland have distinct functions. The mucous cells are the most active and therefore the major product of the submandibular glands is saliva which is mucoid in nature. Mucous cells secrete mucin which aids in the lubrication of the food bolus as it travels through the esophagus. In addition, the serous cells produce salivary amylase, which aids in the breakdown of starches in the mouth. The submandibular gland's highly active acini account for most of the salivary volume. The parotid and sublingual glands account for the remaining. Blood supply The gland receives its blood supply from the facial and lingual arteries.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 255 The gland is supplied by sublingual and submental arteries and drained by common facial and lingual veins. Lymphatic drainage The lymphatics from submandibular gland first drain into submandibular lymph nodes and subsequently into jugulo - digastric lymph nodes. Nerve supply Parasympathetic and Sympathetic connections of the submaxillary and superior cervical ganglia. Their secretions, like the secretions of other salivary glands, are regulated directly by the parasympathetic nervous system and indirectly by the sympathetic nervous system. * Parasympathetic innervation to the submandibular glands is provided by the superior salivatory nucleus via the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve, that becomes part of the trigeminal nerve's lingual nerve prior to synapsing on the submandibular ganglion. Increased parasympathetic activity promotes the secretion of saliva. * The sympathetic nervous system regulates submandibular secretions through vasoconstriction of the arteries that supply it. Increased sympathetic activity reduces glandular bloodflow, thereby decreasing the volume of fluid in salivary secretions, producing an enzyme rich mucous saliva. Nevertheless, direct stimulation of sympathetic nerves will cause an increase in salivary enzymatic secretions. In sum, the volume decreases, but the secretions are increased by parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation. Development The submandibular salivary glands develop later than the parotid glands and appear late in the sixth week of prenatal development. They develop bilaterally from epithelial buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor of the primitive mouth. Solid cords branch from the buds and grow posteriorly, lateral to the developing tongue. The cords of the submandibular gland later branch further and then become canalized to form the ductal part. The submandibular gland acini develop from the cords‚Äô rounded terminal ends at 12 weeks, and secretory activity via the submandibular duct begins at 16 weeks. Growth of the submandibular gland continues after birth with the formation of more acini. Lateral to both sides of the tongue, a linear groove develops and closes over to form the submandibular duct. Clinical significance The submandibular gland accounts for 80% of all salivary duct calculi (salivary stones or sialolith), possibly due to the different nature of the saliva that it produces and the tortuous travel of the submandibular duct to its ductal opening for a considerable upward distance.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 137 The submandibular gland is one of the major three glands that provide the mouth with saliva. The two other types of salivary glands are parotid and sublingual glands.https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/basics/mouth-and- teeth-anatomy/submandibular-gland--location--function-and-complications Additional images File:Gray177.pngMandible.

The design introduced, or brought together, almost all of the features now considered to be \\"standard\\" in modern cargo transport aircraft designs, including a box-like fuselage slung beneath a high wing; a rear loading ramp (that had first appeared on the December 1939-flown Junkers Ju 90 V5 fifth prototype four- engined transport via its Trapoklappe); a high-mounted twin tail for easy access to the hold; and various features for operating from rough fields. Although the Luftwaffe was interested in replacing or supplementing its fleet of outdated Junkers Ju 52/3m transports, it had an abundance of types in production at the time, and did not purchase large numbers of the Ar 232. Design The Ar 232 design resulted from a tender offered by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (German Air Ministry, RLM) in late 1939 for a replacement for the Ju 52/3m transport. Both Arado and Henschel were asked for rear-loading designs powered by two 1,193 kW (1,600 hp) BMW 801A/B radial engines, which was just entering prototype production and not currently used on any front-line designs. The Arado design beat out Henschel's after an examination of the plans, and an order for three prototypes was placed in 1940. Wilhelm van Nes led the design of the Ar 232. He began at the cargo area, with a bay directly behind the \\"stepless cockpit\\" that was 6.6 m (21 ft 7¬æ in) long, 2.3 m (7 ft 6¬Ω in) wide and 2.0 m (6 ft 6¬æ in) high. Typical designs of the era used a side-mounted door for access, but the Ar 232 used hydraulically powered clamshell-doors on the rear of the bay with a ramp to allow cargo to be rolled into the hold. The twin tail configuration tail surfaces were mounted on the end of a long boom to keep the area behind the doors clear so trucks could drive right up to the ramp, much like the 1944-era American Fairchild C-82 Packet of a differing twin boom fuselage configuration. The high-set tail on its \\"pod-and-boom\\" configuration fuselage allowed the Ar 232 to be loaded and unloaded faster than other designs. For short-field performance, the Ar 232 incorporated Arado's own \\"travelling flap\\" design for the entire rear surface of the wing. Even loaded to 16,000 kg (35,270 lb), it could take-off in 200 m (656 ft). This distance could be further reduced by using Starthilfe liquid fuelled monopropellant rocket assist (RATO) jettisonable propulsion units for take-off. Normally operated by a crew of four, the pilot was the only member without two roles. The navigator operated a 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine gun in the nose, the radio operator a 20 mm MG 151 cannon in a rotating turret on the roof, and the loadmaster a 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine gun firing rearward from the extreme rear of the cargo bay above the cargo doors. Landing gear design innovations The most noticeable feature of the Ar 232 was the landing gear. Normal operations from prepared runways used a tricycle gear ‚Äî a then-novel feature for German military aircraft‚Äîbut the sideways-retracting main gear's lever-action lower oleo-strut suspended arm ‚Äì carrying the main gear's wheel/tire unit at the bottoms of the maingears' struts could \\"break\\", or kneel, after landing to place the fuselage closer to the ground and thereby reduce the ramp angle. An additional set of eleven smaller, non-retractable twinned wheels per side, mounted along the ventral centreline of the fuselage from just behind the semi-retractable nosewheel aftwards to just forward of the wing's trailing edge, supported the aircraft once the main landing gear's lever-action lower arm had \\"knelt\\", or could be used for additional support when landing on soft or rough airfields. The aircraft was intended to be capable of taxiing at low speeds on its row of small wheels, thus being able to negotiate small obstacles such as ditches up to 1.5 m (5 ft) in width. The appearance of the row of small wheels led to the nickname \\"millipede\\". In flight, the main legs fully retracted inwards into the wings, while the fixed support wheels remained exposed and the nose wheel only semi-retracted, with the nosewheel tire's lowest point while retracted never going above the lowest point of the 22 auxiliary centre-line wheels' tires. Development Even before the prototypes were complete in 1941, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 project had been earmarked to use the BMW 801A/B, and was proving to be a capable design, with each BMW 801 radial weighing about 1,012 kg (2,231 lb). Production of the BMW 801 was insufficient to supply this new demand, and the Ar 232 was forced to use another engine. Eventually, the BMW Bramo 323 Fafnir nine-cylinder radial, itself weighing some 550 kg (1,210 lbs), from Focke-Wulf's Fw 200 land-based maritime patrol aircraft as an alternate powerplant choice was selected instead, as it was already in production and could meet requirements if the Ar 232 really did replace the Ju 52/3m in service. The prototypes were far enough along that switching engines would have seriously delayed the program, so the first two were to be completed as the Ar 232A, and the third and a newly ordered fourth as the Ar 232B. The third and fourth prototypes (and all production aircraft) used four engines (in place of the two specified in the RLM specification) in order to provide the desired performance. An Ar 232A-0 in 1945 The first two prototypes, bearing the Stammkennzeichen alphabetic codes GH+GN and VD+YA respectively, started trials in early 1941. The first flight resulted in the collapse of the nose gear, but the twenty-two \\"millipede wheels\\" saved the aircraft from damage. A further ten pre- production machines were built, and were used operationally as the Ar 232A-0 while awaiting production versions. In general, the Ar 232 completely outperformed the Ju 52/3m. It carried roughly double the load over longer distances, operated from shorter runways and rougher fields if need be, and cruised about 70 km/h (44 mph) faster. The Ar 232B program ran at the same time. With the quartet of 895 kW (1,200 hp) Bramo 323s replacing the twin BMW 801s, each Bramo 323 with its aforementioned 550 kg dry weight apiece; power increased from 2,386 kW (3,200 hp) to 3,580 kW (4,800 hp), solving the A model's problem of having little excess power in case of engine failure. This change also required the wing to be extended slightly, the span increasing just over 3 m (9 ft 10 in) in total. The extra weight of the Bramo nine- cylinder engines also moved the center of gravity forward, which was offset by stretching the cargo area rearward another meter, adding to the cargo capacity it could carry internally. Two four-engined prototypes were ordered, the V3 and V4, and V3 first flew in May 1942. A further 10 were then ordered as the Ar 232B-0, and were used widely in an operational role. However, this was the only order for the design, as the Luftwaffe gave transport aircraft production a very low priority. Many of those produced were used by Arado to transport aircraft parts between its factories, and did not see front-line service. Plans were also made to replace the outer wing sections and control surfaces with wooden versions to conserve aluminium. Originally to be known as the Ar 232C, the design dragged on and was later renamed the Ar 432. Plans were finally put into place to start production in October 1945, but the war ended without even a prototype being produced. Two even larger planned versions, the Ar 532 and the Ar 632, would have almost doubled the wingspan to 60 m (196 ft 10 in), as large as Germany's six-engined BV 238 flying boat design, and added another two engines. Two of the B-0s were captured by British forces at the end of the war. After test flights by Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown, who gave the design excellent marks, they were used by the Royal Air Force on flights between England and Germany after the war.

Curse of dimensionality  The standard way of representing multidimensional functions are tensor or full grids. The number of basis functions or nodes (grid points) that have to be stored and processed depend exponentially on the number of dimensions.

Kingborough is classified as an urban local government area and has a population of 37,734, it covers the transition from the southern urban areas of Hobart through Kingston, as well as encompassing Bruny Island. Etymology The origin of Kingborough Council is a simple derivation from the name of the main town. The name Kingston was suggested by Mr Lucas in 1851, and the area had been known as Brown's River before then. Why he suggested this name is unknown. Mr Lucas' parents had been raised in England near New Kingston, they had come from Norfolk Island where the capital was Kingston or it might have been named after the Governor of New Norfolk Philip Gidley King. History Europeans settled in the Kingborough Council's district in 1808 at Brown's River (Promenalinah), named after Robert Brown, botanist in 1804. The town and district were both known as Brown's River during the earliest periods of settlement. The Lucas family settled the area and built The Red House, a prominent mansion which is now Kingston Golf Club. Early Kingston developed primarily around The Red House. Development of Kingborough was slow and the first post office opened only in the 1840s. The first road to Hobart, Proctors Road, was opened in 1835. Kingston was proclaimed a town in 1851. The town's name was suggested by the then Police Magistrate, a member of the Lucas family. By 1890 Kingston had a population of 249. When proclaimed on 20 August 1907, the Kingborough Municipality comprised 3 wards: Kingston, Margate and Longley. On 2 April 1993 Kingborough absorbed the former municipality of Bruny. In 1877 Keen's Curry was invented in the municipality. The area developed as a holiday area, especially the suburbs of Kingston Beach and Blackmans Bay. Margate and Kettering operated fishing fleets and Taroona created had a manufacturing industry, primarily through Taroona Shot Tower. Sandfly became a center for small fruits and apple orcharding. The decline of the apple industry progresses during the 1960s, but the industry collapsed entirely following the 1967 Tasmanian fires, when much of the municipality was devastated and most orchards burnt down. A memorial to the 62 fatalities of the fire was constructed in Snug following the fire, where 80 of the towns 120 buildings burned and a permanent exhibition is present at the Channel Heritage Center.

He is known for portraying the role of Joe Mangel from 1988-1991 and 2005 on the Australian soap opera Neighbours. Career Little appeared in a string of Australian films and TV series during the 1980s. He also performed his own comedy/performance in Melbourne's burgeoning comedy clubs throughout the eighties. His longest- running television role was as Joe Mangel in the soap opera Neighbours. He played the role for three years until 1991. The role gave his profile a big boost in the United Kingdom where Neighbours was being watched by ten million people every day at the time. He consequently has spent much of his career in the UK, living for much of the time near the seafront in Brighton and later north London. He has taken many self-devised shows to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and toured them nationally throughout the UK. In 1994, he replaced Chris Evans as the presenter of The Big Breakfast. He has also narrated cult TV series The Villa on Sky TV. He has worked on films such as Blackball and in the West End with his one-man show Defending the Caveman, which also won the Laurence Olivier Award in 2000. He returned to Neighbours as Joe for a brief period in 2005. Little appeared as Roy in a production of Louis Nowra's play Cos√¨ at The White Bear Theatre in Kennington, London, opening 29 July 2008. Since 2009, Little has appeared regularly on the discussion show, The Wright Stuff. As well as extended runs of Defending the Caveman at London's Leicester Square Theatre, he has extensively toured the play around the UK. In June 2010, he made his directorial debut starring in, designing and directing Jack Hibberd's A Stretch of the Imagination at The Cock Tavern Theatre in Kilburn to critical acclaim, receiving Time Out Critic's Choice. In the same year he appeared on Celebrity Masterchef, where he impressed in the first round but narrowly missed out on progressing. He won the theatre-land edition of \\"The Weakest Link\\" donating his winnings to Hove's Martlets Hospice of which he is a patron. Little appeared as a regular on Big Brother's Bit On The Side. In 2011, he wrote and directed the comedy film ROBIN. It was intended as a pilot for a comedy series but was rejected by both the BBC and Channel 4. Little is also writing comedy films and poetry. He appeared in a documentary special celebrating Neighbours 30th anniversary titled Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite, which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015. In December 2017, Little played the character of 'Fleshcreep' in a pantomime production of Jack and the Beanstalk at the Palace Theatre, Mansfield.'Jack & the Beanstalk review at Palace Theatre', 'The Stage', 20 December 2017. https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/jack-beanstalk-review-palace-theatre- mansfield/ In 2019, Little took part in the eleventh series of Dancing on Ice, partnered with Brianne Delcourt.

Laeisz. She was the last commercial sailing ship to round Cape Horn, in 1949. By 1957, she had been outmoded by modern bulk carriers and could not operate at a profit. Her shipping consortium's inability to finance much-needed repairs or to recruit sufficient sail-trained officers caused severe technical difficulties. On 21 September 1957, she was caught in Hurricane Carrie and sank off the Azores, with only six survivors rescued after an extensive search.  History  Early days and World War I  She was built at the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg, launched on 29 July 1905. She had a steel hull and tonnage of 3,020 GRT (2,777 net). She had an overall length of 114.5 m (375 ft), a beam of about 14 m (46 ft) and a draught of 7.25 m (23.5 ft). Three masts stood 51.2 m (168 ft) above deck and the main yard was 28 m (92 ft) wide. She carried 3,800 m¬≤ (40,900 ft¬≤) of sails and could reach a top speed of . Her regular cruise speed was around 8-9 knots. She was the fifth of ten near- sister ships. She was commissioned on 18 October 1905 and used by the Laeisz company in the South American nitrate trade. By 1914, she had made eight voyages to Chile, taking between 64 and about 70 days for a one-way trip from Hamburg to Valpara√≠so or Iquique, the foremost Chilean nitrate ports at the time. From October 1914, she stayed in Santa Cruz de la Palma port in La Palma Island, Canary Islands. Due to post war conditions, she did not return from Santa Cruz de la Palma to Hamburg until 17 March 1920. In the same year, she was handed over to Italy as war reparation. On 15 July 1920, she left Hamburg via Rotterdam to Naples towed by tugs. The Italian government was unable to find a deep-water sailing ship crew, so she was laid up near Castellamare in the Gulf of Naples. In 1924, the F. Laeisz Company bought her back for ¬£7,000 and put her into service in the nitrate trade again. Laeisz sold her in 1931 to the Finnish shipping company of Gustaf Erikson, which used her in the Australian wheat trade.  World War II and beyond Painting of the Pamir by Yasmina (2008) During World War II, Pamir was seized as a prize of war by the New Zealand government on 3 August 1941 while in port at Wellington. Ten commercial voyages were made under the New Zealand flag: five to San Francisco, three to Vancouver,Wells, The Vancouver Voyages of the Barque Pamir one to Sydney and her last voyage across the Tasman from Sydney to Wellington carrying 2,700 tons of cement and 400 tons of nail wire.Tessa Duder (ed), Seduced by the Sea - More Stories from Seafaring Kiwis, Harper Collins, 2002, p. 266 Weathering a storm during the last Tasman voyage is described in detail by one of the mates, Andrew Keyworth, in a letter never posted.Jack Churchouse, The Pamir Under the New Zealand Ensign, Wellington, Millwood Press, 1978 Plaque commemorating the Pamir installed on the waterfront, Wellington, New Zealand She escaped the war unscathed despite a close call in 1943 when a Japanese submarine was spotted. Evidently as a fast-moving barque under a strong and fair wind, she did not interest the submarine's commander.Stark, The Last Time around Cape Horn, p. 80 After the war, she made one voyage from Wellington via Cape Horn to London, then Antwerp to Auckland and Wellington in 1948. She was returned to the Erikson Line on 12 November 1948 at Wellington and sailed to Port Victoria on Spencer Gulf to load Australian grain. On her 128-day journey to Falmouth, she was the last windjammer carrying a commercial load around Cape Horn, on 11 July 1949.Stark, p. 152; see Grain race Gustaf Erikson had died in 1947. His son Edgar found he could no longer operate her (or Passat) at a profit, owing primarily to changing regulations and union contracts governing employment aboard ships; the standard two-watch system on sailing ships was replaced by the three-watch system in use on motor-ships, requiring more crew.Stark, p. 200 In March 1951, Belgian shipbreakers paid ¬£40,000 for her and Passat. As she was being towed to Antwerp, German shipowner Heinz Schliewen, who had sailed on her in the late 1920s, bought her (and Passat, thus often erroneously referred to as a sister ship). The ships were modernized with refurbished quarters to accommodate merchant marine trainees and fitted with an auxiliary engine, a refrigeration system for the galleys (precluding the need to carry live animals for fresh meat), modern communications equipment and water ballast tanks.Apollonio, The Last of the Cape Horners, p. 122 Her first trip was to Brazil in 1952 with cement, to return to Germany with iron ore. Early in the outbound voyage the propeller dropped off, \\"much to the satisfaction of the sail-favoring crew if not the owner.\\"Apollonio, p. 271 The enterprise went briefly bankrupt but was bought by a new consortium of 40 German shipowners.Stiftung Pamir und Passat [Foundation Pamir and Passat] For the next five years, the ships continued to sail between Europe and the east coast of South America, but not around Cape Horn.Stark, p. 201 They were used as cargo-carrying school ships, primarily to Argentina. Although the German public supported the concept as maritime symbols and sources of national pride, the economic realities of the post-war years placed restraints on the operation. The ships were no longer profitable as freight haulers, and Pamir had increasing technical problems such as leaking decks and serious corrosion. The consortium was unable to get sufficient increased funding from German governments or contributions from shipping companies or public donations, and thus let both vessels deteriorate.Hauke Goos. \\"Die Seelenverk√§ufer\\" (in German) - Der Spiegel, 25/2007, pp. 86-95 Last voyage Last Sighting of Pamir? Due to ill health, her regular captain, Hermann Eggers, had been replaced by Captain Johannes Diebitsch, who had sailed on her as a young seaman and had commanded sail-training ships, but had little experience as master of cargo-carrying sailing ships. His first officer, Rolf K√∂hler, was only 29 at the time, and wrote that he was \\"getting thin with anger\\" over the state of the ship and that he was intending to quit the ship's company after arriving home from the next voyage. Captain Diebitsch was criticized for being a harsh and inflexible officer. On 10 August 1957, she left Buenos Aires for Hamburg with a crew of 86, including 52 cadets. Her cargo of 3,780 tons of barley was stored loose in the holds and ballast tanks, secured by 255 tons in sacks on top of the loose grain. Records indicate that this was one of the major mistakes implicated in the sinking ‚Äì she had been held up by a dockworkers' strike, and Diebitsch, under severe pressure to sail, decided to let the trimming (the correct storage of loose cargo so that it does not shift in the hold) be done by his own untrained crew. It was later found that he also had the ballast tank filled with barley. Even though testing of the roll period (the time the ship took to right itself after load transfers) showed that she was dangerously unstable, Diebitsch decided to sail. On the morning of 21 September 1957, she was caught in Hurricane Carrie before shortening sails. It was later considered that because the radio officer had also been given substantial administrative tasks (to save the money required for another officer's position), he had likely not received any of the radio storm warnings. She had also not responded to radio hails by ships that had sighted her earlier in the voyage. She soon listed severely to port in the sudden storm. As hatchways and other openings were not closed at once, they probably allowed considerable amounts of water to enter, as found by the commission which examined the probable causes of the sinking. The shipping company's lawyer at the investigation claimed that the water entered her due to a leak. According to the commission, the water caused her to list further and the grain to shift, which aggravated the list. The captain did not order the flooding of her grain-filled ballast tanks, which would have helped her to right herself. Once she listed severely, the lifeboats could not be deployed because her port side was underwater and her starboard side was raised to an angle that did not allow use of the boats. She sent distress signals before capsizing at 13:03 local time, and sinking after drifting keel-up for 30 minutes in the middle of the Atlantic west-southwest of the Azores at position . Three damaged lifeboats that had come loose before or during the capsizing and the only lifeboat that had been deployed was drifting nearby. None contained any provisions or working distress signal rockets. Many sharks were later seen near the position. A nine-day search for survivors was organized by the United States Coast Guard Cutter , but only four crewmen and two cadets were rescued alive, from two of the lifeboats. It was reported that many of the 86 men aboard had managed to reach the boats, but most died in the next three days. As none of the officers nor the captain survived, the reasons for the capsizing remained uncertain. The sinking made headlines around the world; it was a national tragedy in Germany.Stark, p. 202  Aftermath  Pamir memorial in St Jakob's Church, L√ºbeck, showing one of the lifeboats  False coverage  The sinking received extensive but not always accurate press coverage. For example, The New Zealand Herald reported the following fabrication mixing the real event with imagined details, supposedly directly based on the survivor \\"Gunter Hasselback\\" (his real name was G√ºnter Haselbach): :‚ÄòThe Loss of the Pamir‚Äô :Last of the ‚ÄòP‚Äô Line :‚ÄúOverwhelmed in a hurricane off the Azores on September 21, 1957, - complement of about 80 crew and training cadets ‚Äì 5 survivors picked up on Tuesday, 24th. Survivors tell of how terror struck into the hearts of the naval cadets in the Pamir when huge waves tossed her around like a shuttle cock. Her cargo of wheat shifted and she took on a 45 degree list. Her crew fought to right her and to calm the cadets who were making their first sea voyage, but hysteria gripped them. The captain (Diebitsch) led the cadets in prayer but it was impossible to calm them. He ordered them away in three boats with three experienced hands in each. As the boats were launched they were caught by the mountainous waves and sent hurtling hundreds of feet away from the ship. The boats had hardly been launched when the masts snapped and her sails were blown away. The pounding of the seas and the drag of the masts and rigging over the side, heeled the ship over further and further. It was now impossible to keep the Pamir‚Äôs bows head into the wind ‚Äì she was lying broadside on. There was no time to send another SOS (aerials were down) ‚Äì the end was here. In the trough of a giant wave she rolled right over and we last saw her was her bottom up and going down by the bow like a submarine slowly diving. The few men who were still on board when she capsized were struggling in the water. I don‚Äôt know how we got away but it seemed to me that our lifeboat was the only one successfully launched. We had no flares or smoke signals that worked. I could see nothing of the three boats in which the cadets had been put out from the ship. Seventeen of the men in my boat were washed overboard in the hurricane while rescue aircraft were flying overhead above the storm. Three others, screaming like demons, jumped overboard into the sea on Monday afternoon. I was too weak to stop them. If you had not found me on Tuesday, I would have done the same thing myself.\\" :Gunter Hasselback The Pamir leaving Wapping; watercolour by Richard Howard Penton, c. 1949 The facts as reported by the survivors and established by the Seeamt L√ºbeck, the German authority that investigated the sinking, are that Haselbach was the only survivor rescued from the second lifeboat, not one of the five survivors found together as the article suggests; Pamir had a cargo of barley, not wheat. It is not certain when the cargo shifted; the official opinion of the investigation indicated it was early in the storm, but others have suggested it shifted only at the very end; the cadets had already gone from Hamburg to Buenos Aires before they started the return trip. The survivors reported that crew and cadets stayed very calm until close to the loss of the ship because the ship was not believed to be in difficulties - cadets were still taking photographs, and supposedly some complained when ordered to put on life jackets. Even at the very end, there was no panic. She was not going head into the wind at any time, and her engine was not used. She was mounted more and more to the wind, with waves, more from abaft the beam (behind), hitting roughly from the side. Radio contact was maintained until the end. She sent her last audible SOS call at 12:54 and an indecipherable one at 13:03; she was capsizing around this time. At least one lifeboat broke free before the capsize; others detached briefly before or during the capsizing and sinking. Nobody boarded a lifeboat before she capsized, and nobody jumped overboard: when she capsized, all 86 men were still on board. Her masts did not break nor did any yards or anything else fall down, so nothing was dragging to the side. Some sails were left until they were blown out, but others were shortened or cut off by the crew; the headsail had to be cut with knives before it would blow out. When she sank, she still had set about a third of the mizzen sail and some tarpaulin in the shrouds of the mizzen mast. The boat that Haselbach reached was badly damaged (as were the other two that were salvaged) and almost entirely submerged when he was rescued. Nothing indicates that four boats were manned - the existence of a third manned boat is only assumed, mostly on grounds of survivors' reports of seeing flares one night. Of the 20 or 22 men who were on Haselbach's boat, ten were still on board 24 hours before he was rescued, after the hurricane dissipated. The rescue aircraft could be deployed only after the storm had calmed down. The official documents, including a report by Haselbach during the hours after he was found, say nothing about people screaming when they left the lifeboats.Bericht des Seeamtes L√ºbeck: Der Untergang des Segelschulschiffes ‚ÄûPamir‚Äú.

The Pamir was not last of the ‚ÄòP‚Äô Line, as the newspaper's subtitle suggests. The Passat was still in service, and other ‚ÄòP‚Äô Liners still existed but not under sail, including the Kruzenshtern (ex Padua, the only ‚ÄòP‚Äô Liner still under sail), the Peking and the Pommern.  Insurance  Pamirs last voyage was the only one in her school ship career during which she made a profit, as the insurance sum of about 2.2 million Deutsche Mark was sufficient to cover the company losses for that year. While there was no indication that this was the intention of the consortium, which was never legally blamed for the sinking, some later researchers have considered that through its neglect it was at least strongly implicated in the loss. But the Germanischer Lloyd had recently certified her as seaworthy.Irene Altenm√ºller, \\"Als die 'Pamir' im Hurrikan sank\\", NDR, 21 September 2017  Captains  *1905-1908 Carl Martin Pr√ºtzmann (DE) *1908-1911 Heinrich Horn (DE) *1911-1912 Robert Miethe (DE) *1912-1913 Gustav A.

In mathematics, a complex analytic K3 surface is a compact connected complex manifold of dimension 2 with trivial canonical bundle and irregularity zero. An (algebraic) K3 surface over any field means a smooth proper geometrically connected algebraic surface that satisfies the same conditions. In the Enriques‚ÄìKodaira classification of surfaces, K3 surfaces form one of the four classes of minimal surfaces of Kodaira dimension zero. A simple example is the Fermat quartic surface :x^4+y^4+z^4+w^4=0 in complex projective 3-space. Together with two- dimensional compact complex tori, K3 surfaces are the Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds (and also the hyperk√§hler manifolds) of dimension two. As such, they are at the center of the classification of algebraic surfaces, between the positively curved del Pezzo surfaces (which are easy to classify) and the negatively curved surfaces of general type (which are essentially unclassifiable). K3 surfaces can be considered the simplest algebraic varieties whose structure does not reduce to curves or abelian varieties, and yet where a substantial understanding is possible. A complex K3 surface has real dimension 4, and it plays an important role in the study of smooth 4-manifolds. K3 surfaces have been applied to Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras, mirror symmetry and string theory. It can be useful to think of complex algebraic K3 surfaces as part of the broader family of complex analytic K3 surfaces. Many other types of algebraic varieties do not have such non-algebraic deformations. Definition There are several equivalent ways to define K3 surfaces. The only compact complex surfaces with trivial canonical bundle are K3 surfaces and compact complex tori, and so one can add any condition excluding the latter to define K3 surfaces. For example, it is equivalent to define a complex analytic K3 surface as a simply connected compact complex manifold of dimension 2 with a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic 2-form. (The latter condition says exactly that the canonical bundle is trivial.) There are also some variants of the definition. Over the complex numbers, some authors consider only the algebraic K3 surfaces. (An algebraic K3 surface is automatically projective.Huybrechts (2016), Remark 1.1.2) Or one may allow K3 surfaces to have du Val singularities (the canonical singularities of dimension 2), rather than being smooth. Calculation of the Betti numbers The Betti numbers of a complex analytic K3 surface are computed as follows.Huybrechts (2016), section 1.3. (A similar argument gives the same answer for the Betti numbers of an algebraic K3 surface over any field, defined using l-adic cohomology.) By definition, the canonical bundle K_X=\\\\Omega^2_X is trivial, and the irregularity q(X) (the dimension h^1(X,O_X) of the coherent sheaf cohomology group H^1(X,O_X)) is zero. By Serre duality, :h^2(X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X)=h^0(X,K_X)=1. As a result, the arithmetic genus (or holomorphic Euler characteristic) of X is: :\\\\chi(X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X):=\\\\sum_i (-1)^i h^i(X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X)=1-0+1=2. On the other hand, the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem (Noether's formula) says: :\\\\chi(X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X)=\\\\frac{1}{12}(c_1(X)^2+c_2(X)), where c_i(X) is the i-th Chern class of the tangent bundle. Since K_X is trivial, its first Chern class c_1(K_X)=-c_1(X) is zero, and so c_2(X)=24. Next, the exponential sequence 0\\\\to \\\\Z_X\\\\to O_X\\\\to O_X^*\\\\to 0 gives an exact sequence of cohomology groups 0\\\\to H^1(X,\\\\Z)\\\\to H^1(X,O_X), and so H^1(X,\\\\Z)=0. Thus the Betti number b_1(X) is zero, and by Poincar√© duality, b_3(X) is also zero. Finally, c_2(X)=24 is equal to the topological Euler characteristic :\\\\chi(X)=\\\\sum_i (-1)^ib_i(X). Since b_0(X)=b_4(X)=1 and b_1(X)=b_3(X)=0, it follows that b_2(X)=22. Properties *Any two complex analytic K3 surfaces are diffeomorphic as smooth 4-manifolds, by Kunihiko Kodaira.Huybrechts (2016), Theorem 7.1.1. *Every complex analytic K3 surface has a K√§hler metric, by Yum-Tong Siu.Barth et al. (2004), section IV.3. (Analogously, but much easier: every algebraic K3 surface over a field is projective.) By Shing-Tung Yau's solution to the Calabi conjecture, it follows that every complex analytic K3 surface has a Ricci-flat K√§hler metric. *The Hodge numbers of any K3 surface are listed in the Hodge diamond: :: :One way to show this is to calculate the Jacobian ideal of a specific K3 surface, and then using a Variation of Hodge structure on the moduli of algebraic K3 surfaces to show that all such K3 surfaces have the same Hodge numbers. A more low-brow calculation can be done using the calculation of the Betti numbers along with the parts of the Hodge structure computed on H^2(X;\\\\mathbb{Z}) for an arbitrary K3 surface. In this case, Hodge symmetry forces H^0(X;\\\\Omega_X^2)\\\\cong \\\\mathbb{C}, hence H^1(X,\\\\Omega_X) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{C}^{20}. For K3 surfaces in characteristic p > 0, this was first shown by Alexey Rudakov and Igor Shafarevich.Huybrechts (2016), Theorem 9.5.1. *For a complex analytic K3 surface X, the intersection form (or cup product) on H^2(X,\\\\Z)\\\\cong\\\\Z^{22} is a symmetric bilinear form with values in the integers, known as the K3 lattice. This is isomorphic to the even unimodular lattice \\\\operatorname{II}_{3,19}, or equivalently E_8(-1)^{\\\\oplus 2}\\\\oplus U^{\\\\oplus 3}, where U is the hyperbolic lattice of rank 2 and E_8 is the E8 lattice.Huybrechts (2016), Proposition 3.3.5. *Yukio Matsumoto's 11/8 conjecture predicts that every smooth oriented 4-manifold X with even intersection form has second Betti number at least 11/8 times the absolute value of the signature. This would be optimal if true, since equality holds for a complex K3 surface, which has signature 3‚àí19 = ‚àí16. The conjecture would imply that every simply connected smooth 4-manifold with even intersection form is homeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of the K3 surface and of S^2\\\\times S^2.Scorpan (2005), section 5.3. *Every complex surface that is diffeomorphic to a K3 surface is a K3 surface, by Robert Friedman and John Morgan. On the other hand, there are smooth complex surfaces (some of them projective) that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to a K3 surface, by Kodaira and Michael Freedman.Huybrechts (2016), Remark 1.3.6(ii). These \\"homotopy K3 surfaces\\" all have Kodaira dimension 1. Examples *The double cover X of the projective plane branched along a smooth sextic (degree 6) curve is a K3 surface of genus 2 (that is, degree 2g‚àí2 = 2). (This terminology means that the inverse image in X of a general hyperplane in \\\\mathbf{P}^2 is a smooth curve of genus 2.) *A smooth quartic (degree 4) surface in \\\\mathbf{P}^3 is a K3 surface of genus 3 (that is, degree 4). *A Kummer surface is the quotient of a two-dimensional abelian variety A by the action a\\\\mapsto -a. This results in 16 singularities, at the 2-torsion points of A. The minimal resolution of this singular surface may also be called a Kummer surface; that resolution is a K3 surface. When A is the Jacobian of a curve of genus 2, Kummer showed that the quotient A/(\\\\pm 1) can be embedded into \\\\mathbf{P}^3 as a quartic surface with 16 nodes. *More generally: for any quartic surface Y with du Val singularities, the minimal resolution of Y is an algebraic K3 surface. *The intersection of a quadric and a cubic in \\\\mathbf{P}^4 is a K3 surface of genus 4 (that is, degree 6). *The intersection of three quadrics in \\\\mathbf{P}^5 is a K3 surface of genus 5 (that is, degree 8). *There are several databases of K3 surfaces with du Val singularities in weighted projective spaces.; . The Picard lattice The Picard group Pic(X) of a complex analytic K3 surface X means the abelian group of complex analytic line bundles on X. For an algebraic K3 surface, Pic(X) means the group of algebraic line bundles on X. The two definitions agree for a complex algebraic K3 surface, by Jean-Pierre Serre's GAGA theorem. The Picard group of a K3 surface X is always a finitely generated free abelian group; its rank is called the Picard number \\\\rho. In the complex case, Pic(X) is a subgroup of H^2(X,\\\\Z)\\\\cong\\\\Z^{22}. It is an important feature of K3 surfaces that many different Picard numbers can occur. For X a complex algebraic K3 surface, \\\\rho can be any integer between 1 and 20. In the complex analytic case, \\\\rho may also be zero. (In that case, X contains no closed complex curves at all. By contrast, an algebraic surface always contains many continuous families of curves.) Over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0, there is a special class of K3 surfaces, supersingular K3 surfaces, with Picard number 22. The Picard lattice of a K3 surface means the abelian group Pic(X) together with its intersection form, a symmetric bilinear form with values in the integers. (Over \\\\Complex, the intersection form means the restriction of the intersection form on H^2(X,\\\\Z). Over a general field, the intersection form can be defined using the intersection theory of curves on a surface, by identifying the Picard group with the divisor class group.) The Picard lattice of a K3 surface is always even, meaning that the integer u^2 is even for each u\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Pic}(X). The Hodge index theorem implies that the Picard lattice of an algebraic K3 surface has signature (1,\\\\rho-1). Many properties of a K3 surface are determined by its Picard lattice, as a symmetric bilinear form over the integers. This leads to a strong connection between the theory of K3 surfaces and the arithmetic of symmetric bilinear forms. As a first example of this connection: a complex analytic K3 surface is algebraic if and only if there is an element u\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Pic}(X) with u^2>0.Barth et al. (2004), Theorem 6.1. Roughly speaking, the space of all complex analytic K3 surfaces has complex dimension 20, while the space of K3 surfaces with Picard number \\\\rho has dimension 20-\\\\rho (excluding the supersingular case). In particular, algebraic K3 surfaces occur in 19-dimensional families. More details about moduli spaces of K3 surfaces are given below. The precise description of which lattices can occur as Picard lattices of K3 surfaces is complicated. One clear statement, due to Viacheslav Nikulin and David Morrison, is that every even lattice of signature (1,\\\\rho-1) with \\\\rho\\\\leq 11 is the Picard lattice of some complex projective K3 surface.Huybrechts (2016), Corollary 14.3.1 and Remark 14.3.7. The space of such surfaces has dimension 20-\\\\rho. Elliptic K3 surfaces An important subclass of K3 surfaces, easier to analyze than the general case, consists of the K3 surfaces with an elliptic fibration X\\\\to\\\\mathbf{P}^1. \\"Elliptic\\" means that all but finitely many fibers of this morphism are smooth curves of genus 1. The singular fibers are unions of rational curves, with the possible types of singular fibers classified by Kodaira. There are always some singular fibers, since the sum of the topological Euler characteristics of the singular fibers is \\\\chi(X)=24. A general elliptic K3 surface has exactly 24 singular fibers, each of type I_1 (a nodal cubic curve).Huybrechts (2016), Remark 11.1.12. Whether a K3 surface is elliptic can be read from its Picard lattice. Namely, in characteristic not 2 or 3, a K3 surface X has an elliptic fibration if and only if there is a nonzero element u\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Pic}(X) with u^2=0.Huybrechts (2016), Proposition 11.1.3. (In characteristic 2 or 3, the latter condition may also correspond to a quasi-elliptic fibration.) It follows that having an elliptic fibration is a codimension-1 condition on a K3 surface. So there are 19-dimensional families of complex analytic K3 surfaces with an elliptic fibration, and 18-dimensional moduli spaces of projective K3 surfaces with an elliptic fibration. Example: Every smooth quartic surface X in \\\\mathbf{P}^3 that contains a line L has an elliptic fibration X\\\\to \\\\mathbf{P}^1, given by projecting away from L. The moduli space of all smooth quartic surfaces (up to isomorphism) has dimension 19, while the subspace of quartic surfaces containing a line has dimension 18. Rational curves on K3 surfaces In contrast to positively curved varieties such as del Pezzo surfaces, a complex algebraic K3 surface X is not uniruled; that is, it is not covered by a continuous family of rational curves. On the other hand, in contrast to negatively curved varieties such as surfaces of general type, X contains a large discrete set of rational curves (possibly singular). In particular, Fedor Bogomolov and David Mumford showed that every curve on X is linearly equivalent to a positive linear combination of rational curves.Huybrechts (2016), Corollary 13.1.5. Another contrast to negatively curved varieties is that the Kobayashi metric on a complex analytic K3 surface X is identically zero. The proof uses that an algebraic K3 surface X is always covered by a continuous family of images of elliptic curves.Kamenova et al. (2014), Corollary 2.2; Huybrechts (2016), Corollary 13.2.2. (These curves are singular in X, unless X happens to be an elliptic K3 surface.) A stronger question that remains open is whether every complex K3 surface admits a nondegenerate holomorphic map from \\\\C^2 (where \\"nondegenerate\\" means that the derivative of the map is an isomorphism at some point).Huybrechts (2016), section 13.0.3.. The period map Define a marking of a complex analytic K3 surface X to be an isomorphism of lattices from H^2(X,\\\\Z) to the K3 lattice \\\\Lambda=E_8(-1)^{\\\\oplus 2}\\\\oplus U^{\\\\oplus 3}. The space N of marked complex K3 surfaces is a non-Hausdorff complex manifold of dimension 20.Huybrechts (2016), section 6.3.3. The set of isomorphism classes of complex analytic K3 surfaces is the quotient of N by the orthogonal group O(\\\\Lambda), but this quotient is not a geometrically meaningful moduli space, because the action of O(\\\\Lambda) is far from being properly discontinuous.Huybrechts (2016), section 6.3.1 and Remark 6.3.6. (For example, the space of smooth quartic surfaces is irreducible of dimension 19, and yet every complex analytic K3 surface in the 20-dimensional family N has arbitrarily small deformations which are isomorphic to smooth quartics.Huybrechts (2016), section 7.1.3.) For the same reason, there is not a meaningful moduli space of compact complex tori of dimension at least 2. The period mapping sends a K3 surface to its Hodge structure. When stated carefully, the Torelli theorem holds: a K3 surface is determined by its Hodge structure. The period domain is defined as the 20-dimensional complex manifold :D={u\\\\in P(\\\\Lambda\\\\otimes\\\\Complex): u^2=0,\\\\, u\\\\cdot\\\\overline{u} > 0}. The period mapping N\\\\to D sends a marked K3 surface X to the complex line H^0(X,\\\\Omega^2)\\\\subset H^2(X,\\\\Complex)\\\\cong \\\\Lambda\\\\otimes\\\\Complex. This is surjective, and a local isomorphism, but not an isomorphism (in particular because D is Hausdorff and N is not). However, the global Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces says that the quotient map of sets :N/O(\\\\Lambda)\\\\to D/O(\\\\Lambda) is bijective. It follows that two complex analytic K3 surfaces X and Y are isomorphic if and only if there is a Hodge isometry from H^2(X,\\\\Z) to H^2(Y,\\\\Z), that is, an isomorphism of abelian groups that preserves the intersection form and sends H^0(X,\\\\Omega^2)\\\\subset H^2(X,\\\\Complex) to H^0(Y,\\\\Omega^2).Huybrechts (2016), Theorem 7.5.3. Moduli spaces of projective K3 surfaces A polarized K3 surface X of genus g is defined to be a projective K3 surface together with an ample line bundle L such that L is primitive (that is, not 2 or more times another line bundle) and c_1(L)^2=2g-2. This is also called a polarized K3 surface of degree 2g‚àí2.Huybrechts (2016), Definition 2.4.1. Under these assumptions, L is basepoint-free. In characteristic zero, Bertini's theorem implies that there is a smooth curve C in the linear system L. All such curves have genus g, which explains why (X,L) is said to have genus g. The vector space of sections of L has dimension g + 1, and so L gives a morphism from X to projective space \\\\mathbf{P}^g. In most cases, this morphism is an embedding, so that X is isomorphic to a surface of degree 2g‚àí2 in \\\\mathbf{P}^g. There is an irreducible coarse moduli space \\\\mathcal{F}_g of polarized complex K3 surfaces of genus g for each g\\\\geq 2; it can be viewed as a Zariski open subset of a Shimura variety for the group SO(2,19). For each g, \\\\mathcal{F}_g is a quasi- projective complex variety of dimension 19.Huybrechts (2016), Corollary 6.4.4. Shigeru Mukai showed that this moduli space is unirational if g\\\\leq 13 or g=18,20. In contrast, Valery Gritsenko, Klaus Hulek and Gregory Sankaran showed that \\\\mathcal{F}_g is of general type if g\\\\geq 63 or g=47,51,55,58,59,61. A survey of this area was given by . The different 19-dimensional moduli spaces \\\\mathcal{F}_g overlap in an intricate way. Indeed, there is a countably infinite set of codimension-1 subvarieties of each \\\\mathcal{F}_g corresponding to K3 surfaces of Picard number at least 2. Those K3 surfaces have polarizations of infinitely many different degrees, not just 2g‚Äì2. So one can say that infinitely many of the other moduli spaces \\\\mathcal{F}_h meet \\\\mathcal{F}_g. This is imprecise, since there is not a well-behaved space containing all the moduli spaces \\\\mathcal{F}_g. However, a concrete version of this idea is the fact that any two complex algebraic K3 surfaces are deformation-equivalent through algebraic K3 surfaces.Huybrechts (2016), section 7.1.1. More generally, a quasi-polarized K3 surface of genus g means a projective K3 surface with a primitive nef and big line bundle L such that c_1(L)^2=2g-2. Such a line bundle still gives a morphism to \\\\mathbf{P}^g, but now it may contract finitely many (‚àí2)-curves, so that the image Y of X is singular. (A (‚àí2)-curve on a surface means a curve isomorphic to \\\\mathbf{P}^1 with self-intersection ‚àí2.) The moduli space of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces of genus g is still irreducible of dimension 19 (containing the previous moduli space as an open subset). Formally, it works better to view this as a moduli space of K3 surfaces Y with du Val singularities.Huybrechts (2016), section 5.1.4 and Remark 6.4.5. The ample cone and the cone of curves A remarkable feature of algebraic K3 surfaces is that the Picard lattice determines many geometric properties of the surface, including the convex cone of ample divisors (up to automorphisms of the Picard lattice). The ample cone is determined by the Picard lattice as follows. By the Hodge index theorem, the intersection form on the real vector space N^1(X):=\\\\operatorname{Pic}(X)\\\\otimes\\\\R has signature (1,\\\\rho-1). It follows that the set of elements of N^1(X) with positive self-intersection has two connected components. Call the positive cone the component that contains any ample divisor on X. Case 1: There is no element u of Pic(X) with u^2=-2. Then the ample cone is equal to the positive cone. Thus it is the standard round cone. Case 2: Otherwise, let \\\\Delta={u\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Pic}(X):u^2=-2}, the set of roots of the Picard lattice. The orthogonal complements of the roots form a set of hyperplanes which all go through the positive cone. Then the ample cone is a connected component of the complement of these hyperplanes in the positive cone. Any two such components are isomorphic via the orthogonal group of the lattice Pic(X), since that contains the reflection across each root hyperplane. In this sense, the Picard lattice determines the ample cone up to isomorphism.Huybrechts (2016), Corollary 8.2.11. A related statement, due to S√°ndor Kov√°cs, is that knowing one ample divisor A in Pic(X) determines the whole cone of curves of X. Namely, suppose that X has Picard number \\\\rho\\\\geq 3. If the set of roots \\\\Delta is empty, then the closed cone of curves is the closure of the positive cone. Otherwise, the closed cone of curves is the closed convex cone spanned by all elements u\\\\in\\\\Delta with A\\\\cdot u>0. In the first case, X contains no (‚àí2)-curves; in the second case, the closed cone of curves is the closed convex cone spanned by all (‚àí2)-curves.Huybrechts (2016), Corollary 8.3.12. (If \\\\rho=2, there is one other possibility: the cone of curves may be spanned by one (‚àí2)-curve and one curve with self-intersection 0.) So the cone of curves is either the standard round cone, or else it has \\"sharp corners\\" (because every (‚àí2)-curve spans an isolated extremal ray of the cone of curves). Automorphism group K3 surfaces are somewhat unusual among algebraic varieties in that their automorphism groups may be infinite, discrete, and highly nonabelian. By a version of the Torelli theorem, the Picard lattice of a complex algebraic K3 surface X determines the automorphism group of X up to commensurability. Namely, let the Weyl group W be the subgroup of the orthogonal group O(Pic(X)) generated by reflections in the set of roots \\\\Delta. Then W is a normal subgroup of O(Pic(X)), and the automorphism group of X is commensurable with the quotient group O(Pic(X))/W. A related statement, due to Hans Sterk, is that Aut(X) acts on the nef cone of X with a rational polyhedral fundamental domain.Huybrechts (2016), Theorem 8.4.2. Relation to string duality K3 surfaces appear almost ubiquitously in string duality and provide an important tool for the understanding of it. String compactifications on these surfaces are not trivial, yet they are simple enough to analyze most of their properties in detail. The type IIA string, the type IIB string, the E8√óE8 heterotic string, the Spin(32)/Z2 heterotic string, and M-theory are related by compactification on a K3 surface. For example, the Type IIA string compactified on a K3 surface is equivalent to the heterotic string compactified on a 4-torus (). History Quartic surfaces in \\\\mathbf{P}^3 were studied by Ernst Kummer, Arthur Cayley, Friedrich Schur and other 19th- century geometers. More generally, Federigo Enriques observed in 1893 that for various numbers g, there are surfaces of degree 2g‚àí2 in \\\\mathbf{P}^g with trivial canonical bundle and irregularity zero.Enriques (1893), section III.6. In 1909, Enriques showed that such surfaces exist for all g\\\\geq 3, and Francesco Severi showed that the moduli space of such surfaces has dimension 19 for each g.Enriques (1909); Severi (1909). Andr√© gave K3 surfaces their name (see the quotation above) and made several influential conjectures about their classification. Kunihiko Kodaira completed the basic theory around 1960, in particular making the first systematic study of complex analytic K3 surfaces which are not algebraic. He showed that any two complex analytic K3 surfaces are deformation-equivalent and hence diffeomorphic, which was new even for algebraic K3 surfaces. An important later advance was the proof of the Torelli theorem for complex algebraic K3 surfaces by Ilya Piatetski- Shapiro and Igor Shafarevich (1971), extended to complex analytic K3 surfaces by Daniel Burns and Michael Rapoport (1975).

Category:Algebraic surfaces Category:Complex surfaces Category:Differential geometry Category:String theory ","title":"K3 surface"},{"id":"646120","text":"In differential geometry, a hyperk√§hler manifold is a Riemannian manifold of dimension 4k and holonomy group contained in Sp(k) (here Sp(k) denotes a compact form of a symplectic group, identified with the group of quaternionic- linear unitary endomorphisms of a k-dimensional quaternionic Hermitian space). Hyperk√§hler manifolds are special classes of K√§hler manifolds. They can be thought of as quaternionic analogues of K√§hler manifolds. All hyperk√§hler manifolds are Ricci-flat and are thus Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds (this can be easily seen by noting that Sp(k) is a subgroup of the special unitary group SU(2k)). Hyperk√§hler manifolds were defined by Eugenio Calabi in 1978. Quaternionic structure Every hyperk√§hler manifold M has a 2-sphere of complex structures (i.e. integrable almost complex structures) with respect to which the metric is K√§hler. In particular, it is a hypercomplex manifold, meaning that there are three distinct complex structures, I, J, and K, which satisfy the quaternion relations :I^2 = J^2 = K^2 = IJK = -1.\\\\, Any linear combination :aI + bJ + cK \\\\, with a, b, c real numbers such that :a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1 \\\\, is also a complex structure on M. In particular, the tangent space TxM is a quaternionic vector space for each point x of M. Sp(k) can be considered as the group of orthogonal transformations of \\\\mathbb{R}^{4k}=\\\\mathbb{H}^k which are linear with respect to I, J and K. From this it follows that the holonomy of the manifold is contained in Sp(k). Conversely, if the holonomy group of the Riemannian manifold M is contained in Sp(k), choose complex structures Ix, Jx and Kx on TxM which make TxM into a quaternionic vector space. Parallel transport of these complex structures gives the required quaternionic structure on M. Holomorphic symplectic form A hyperk√§hler manifold (M,I,J,K), considered as a complex manifold (M,I), is holomorphically symplectic (equipped with a holomorphic, non-degenerate 2-form). The converse is also true in the case of compact manifolds, due to Shing-Tung Yau's proof of the Calabi conjecture: Given a compact, K√§hler, holomorphically symplectic manifold (M,I), it is always equipped with a compatible hyperk√§hler metric. Such a metric is unique in a given K√§hler class. Compact hyperk√§hler manifolds have been extensively studied using techniques from algebraic geometry, sometimes under a name holomorphically symplectic manifolds. The holonomy group of any Calabi-Yau metric on a simply connected compact holomorphically symplectic manifold with H^{2,0}(M)=1 is exactly Sp(k); and if the simply connected Calabi-Yau manifold instead has H^{2,0}(M)\\\\geq 2, it is just the Riemannian product of lower-dimensional hyperk√§hler manifolds. This fact immediately follows from the Bochner formula for holomorphic forms on a K√§hler manifold, together the Berger classification of holonomy groups; ironically, it is often attributed to Bogomolov, who incorrectly went on to claim in the same paper that compact hyperk√§hler manifolds actually do not exist! Examples Due to Kunihiko Kodaira's classification of complex surfaces, we know that any compact hyperk√§hler 4-manifold is either a K3 surface or a compact torus T^4. (Every Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold in 4 (real) dimensions is a hyperk√§hler manifold, because SU(2) is isomorphic to Sp(1).) As was discovered by Beauville, the Hilbert scheme of k points on a compact hyperk√§hler 4-manifold is a hyperk√§hler manifold of dimension 4k. This gives rise to two series of compact examples: Hilbert schemes of points on a K3 surface and generalized Kummer varieties. Non-compact, complete, hyperk√§hler 4-manifolds which are asymptotic to H/G, where H denotes the quaternions and G is a finite subgroup of Sp(1), are known as asymptotically locally Euclidean, or ALE, spaces. These spaces, and various generalizations involving different asymptotic behaviors, are studied in physics under the name gravitational instantons. The Gibbons‚ÄìHawking ansatz gives examples invariant under a circle action. Many examples of noncompact hyperk√§hler manifolds arise as moduli spaces of solutions to certain gauge theory equations which arise from the dimensional reduction of the anti-self dual Yang‚ÄìMills equations: instanton moduli spaces, monopole moduli spaces, spaces of solutions to Nigel Hitchin's self-duality equations on Riemann surfaces, space of solutions to Nahm equations. Another class of examples are the Nakajima quiver varieties, which are of great importance in representation theory. Cohomology show that the cohomology of any compact hyperk√§hler manifold embedds into the cohomology of a torus, in a way that preserves the Hodge structure.

F1 hybrid (middle) exhibiting heterosis. Heterosis, hybrid vigor, or outbreeding enhancement is the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. An offspring is heterotic if its traits are enhanced as a result of mixing the genetic contributions of its parents. These effects can be due to Mendelian or non-Mendelian inheritance.  Definitions  In proposing the term heterosis to replace the older term heterozygosis, G.H. Shull aimed to avoid limiting the term to the effects that can be explained by heterozygosity in Mendelian inheritance. Heterosis is often discussed as the opposite of inbreeding depression although differences in these two concepts can be seen in evolutionary considerations such as the role of genetic variation or the effects of genetic drift in small populations on these concepts. Inbreeding depression occurs when related parents have children with traits that negatively influence their fitness largely due to homozygosity. In such instances, outcrossing should result in heterosis. Not all outcrosses result in heterosis. For example, when a hybrid inherits traits from its parents that are not fully compatible, fitness can be reduced. This is a form of outbreeding depression. Dominance versus overdominance Dominance versus overdominance is a scientific controversy in the field of genetics that has persisted for more than a century. These two alternative hypotheses were first stated in 1908. Genetic basis When a population is small or inbred, it tends to lose genetic diversity. Inbreeding depression is the loss of fitness due to loss of genetic diversity. Inbred strains tend to be homozygous for recessive alleles that are mildly harmful (or produce a trait that is undesirable from the standpoint of the breeder). Heterosis or hybrid vigor, on the other hand, is the tendency of outbred strains to exceed both inbred parents in fitness. Selective breeding of plants and animals, including hybridization, began long before there was an understanding of underlying scientific principles. In the early 20th century, after Mendel's laws came to be understood and accepted, geneticists undertook to explain the superior vigor of many plant hybrids. Two competing hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, were developed: thumb300pxright Genetic basis of heterosis. Dominance hypothesis. Scenario A. Fewer genes are under-expressed in the homozygous individual. Gene expression in the offspring is equal to the expression of the fittest parent. Overdominance hypothesis. Scenario B. Over- expression of certain genes in the heterozygous offspring. (The size of the circle depicts the expression level of gene A) * Dominance hypothesis. The dominance hypothesis attributes the superiority of hybrids to the suppression of undesirable recessive alleles from one parent by dominant alleles from the other. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to loss of genetic diversity, with the strains becoming purely homozygous at many loci. The dominance hypothesis was first expressed in 1908 by the geneticist Charles Davenport. Under the dominance hypothesis, deleterious alleles are expected to be maintained in a random-mating population at a selection‚Äìmutation balance that would depend on the rate of mutation, the effect of the alleles and the degree to which alleles are expressed in heterozygotes. * Overdominance hypothesis. Certain combinations of alleles that can be obtained by crossing two inbred strains are advantageous in the heterozygote. The overdominance hypothesis attributes the heterozygote advantage to the survival of many alleles that are recessive and harmful in homozygotes. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to a high percentage of these harmful recessives. The overdominance hypothesis was developed independently by Edward M. East (1908) and George Shull (1908). Genetic variation at an overdominant locus is expected to be maintained by balancing selection. The high fitness of heterozygous genotypes favours the persistence of an allelic polymorphism in the population. Dominance and overdominance have different consequences for the gene expression profile of the individuals. If overdominance is the main cause for the fitness advantages of heterosis, then there should be an over- expression of certain genes in the heterozygous offspring compared to the homozygous parents. On the other hand, if dominance is the cause, fewer genes should be under-expressed in the heterozygous offspring compared to the parents. Furthermore, for any given gene, the expression should be comparable to the one observed in the fitter of the two parents. Historical retrospective Population geneticist James Crow (1916‚Äì2012) believed, in his younger days, that overdominance was a major contributor to hybrid vigor. In 1998 he published a retrospective review of the developing science. According to Crow, the demonstration of several cases of heterozygote advantage in Drosophila and other organisms first caused great enthusiasm for the overdominance theory among scientists studying plant hybridization. But overdominance implies that yields on an inbred strain should decrease as inbred strains are selected for the performance of their hybrid crosses, as the proportion of harmful recessives in the inbred population rises. Over the years, experimentation in plant genetics has proven that the reverse occurs, that yields increase in both the inbred strains and the hybrids, suggesting that dominance alone may be adequate to explain the superior yield of hybrids. Only a few conclusive cases of overdominance have been reported in all of genetics. Since the 1980s, as experimental evidence has mounted, the dominance theory has made a comeback. Crow wrote: > The current view ... is that the dominance hypothesis is the major > explanation of inbreeding decline and [of] the high yield of hybrids. There > is little statistical evidence for contributions from overdominance and > epistasis. But whether the best hybrids are getting an extra boost from > overdominance or favorable epistatic contributions remains an open question.  Controversy  The term heterosis often causes confusion and even controversy, particularly in selective breeding of domestic animals, because it is sometimes (incorrectly) claimed that all crossbred plants and animals are \\"genetically superior\\" to their parents, due to heterosis. However, there are two problems with this claim: * First, according to an article published in the journal Genome Biology, \\"genetic superiority\\" is an ill-defined term and not generally accepted terminology within the scientific field of genetics. A related term fitness is well defined, but it can rarely be directly measured. Instead, scientists use objective, measurable quantities, such as the number of seeds a plant produces, the germination rate of a seed, or the percentage of organisms that survive to reproductive age. From this perspective, crossbred plants and animals exhibiting heterosis may have \\"superior\\" traits, but this does not necessarily equate to any evidence of outright \\"genetic superiority\\". Use of the term \\"superiority\\" is commonplace for example in crop breeding, where it is well understood to mean a better- yielding, more robust plant for agriculture. Such a plant may yield better on a farm, but would likely struggle to survive in the wild, making this use open to misinterpretation. In human genetics any question of \\"genetic superiority\\" is even more problematic due to the historical and political implications of any such claim. Some may even go as far as to describe it as a questionable value judgement in the realm of politics, not science. * Second, not all hybrids exhibit heterosis (see outbreeding depression). An example of the ambiguous value judgements imposed on hybrids and hybrid vigor is the mule. While mules are almost always infertile, they are valued for a combination of hardiness and temperament that is different from either of their horse or donkey parents. While these qualities may make them \\"superior\\" for particular uses by humans, the infertility issue implies that these animals would most likely become extinct without the intervention of humans through animal husbandry, making them \\"inferior\\" in terms of natural selection.  Genetic and epigenetic bases  Since the early 1900s, two competing genetic hypotheses, not necessarily mutually exclusive, have been developed to explain hybrid vigor. More recently, an epigenetic component of hybrid vigor has also been established. The genetic dominance hypothesis attributes the superiority of hybrids to the masking of expression of undesirable (deleterious) recessive alleles from one parent by dominant (usually wild-type) alleles from the other (see Complementation (genetics)). It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive alleles. The genetic overdominance hypothesis states that some combinations of alleles (which can be obtained by crossing two inbred strains) are especially advantageous when paired in a heterozygous individual. This hypothesis is commonly invoked to explain the persistence of some alleles (most famously the Sickle cell trait allele) that are harmful in homozygotes. In normal circumstances, such harmful alleles would be removed from a population through the process of natural selection. Like the dominance hypothesis, it attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to expression of such harmful recessive alleles. In any case, outcross matings provide the benefit of masking deleterious recessive alleles in progeny. This benefit has been proposed to be a major factor in the maintenance of sexual reproduction among eukaryotes, as summarized in the article Evolution of sexual reproduction. An epigenetic contribution to heterosis has been established in plants, and it has also been reported in animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), discovered in 1993, are a class of non-coding small RNAs which repress the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or cause degradation of mRNAs. In hybrid plants, most miRNAs have non-additive expression (it might be higher or lower than the levels in the parents). This suggests that the small RNAs are involved in the growth, vigor and adaptation of hybrids. 'Heterosis without hybridity' effects on plant size have been demonstrated in genetically isogenic F1 triploid (autopolyploid) plants, where paternal genome excess F1 triploids display positive heterosis, whereas maternal genome excess F1s display negative heterosis effects. Such findings demonstrate that heterosis effects, with a genome dosage-dependent epigenetic basis, can be generated in F1 offspring that are genetically isogenic (i.e. harbour no heterozygosity). It has been shown that hybrid vigor in an allopolyploid hybrid of two Arabidopsis species was due to epigenetic control in the upstream regions of two genes, which caused major downstream alteration in chlorophyll and starch accumulation. The mechanism involves acetylation and/or methylation of specific amino acids in histone H3, a protein closely associated with DNA, which can either activate or repress associated genes.  Major histocompatibility complex in animals  One example of where particular genes may be important in vertebrate animals for heterosis is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Vertebrates inherit several copies of both MHC class I and MHC class II from each parent, which are used in antigen presentation as part of the adaptive immune system. Each different copy of the genes is able to bind and present a different set of potential peptides to T-lymphocytes. These genes are highly polymorphic throughout populations, but will be more similar in smaller, more closely related populations. Breeding between more genetically distant individuals will decrease the chance of inheriting two alleles which are the same or similar, allowing a more diverse range of peptides to be presented. This therefore gives a decreased chance that any particular pathogen will not be recognised, and means that more antigenic proteins on any pathogen are likely to be recognised, giving a greater range of T-cell activation and therefore a greater response. This will also mean that the immunity acquired to the pathogen will be against a greater range of antigens, meaning that the pathogen must mutate more before immunity is lost. Thus hybrids will be less likely to be succumb to pathogenic disease and will be more capable of fighting off infection.  Plants  Crosses between inbreds from different heterotic groups result in vigorous F1 hybrids with significantly more heterosis than F1 hybrids from inbreds within the same heterotic group or pattern. Heterotic groups are created by plant breeders to classify inbred lines, and can be progressively improved by reciprocal recurrent selection. Heterosis is used to increase yields, uniformity, and vigor. Hybrid breeding methods are used in maize, sorghum, rice, sugar beet, onion, spinach, sunflowers, broccoli and to create a more psychoactive cannabis.  Corn (maize)  Nearly all field corn (maize) grown in most developed nations exhibits heterosis. Modern corn hybrids substantially outyield conventional cultivars and respond better to fertilizer. Corn heterosis was famously demonstrated in the early 20th century by George H. Shull and Edward M. East after hybrid corn was invented by Dr. William James Beal of Michigan State University based on work begun in 1879 at the urging of Charles Darwin. Dr. Beal's work led to the first published account of a field experiment demonstrating hybrid vigor in corn, by Eugene Davenport and Perry Holden, 1881. These various pioneers of botany and related fields showed that crosses of inbred lines made from a Southern dent and a Northern flint, respectively, showed substantial heterosis and outyielded conventional cultivars of that era. However, at that time such hybrids could not be economically made on a large scale for use by farmers. Donald F. Jones at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven invented the first practical method of producing a high-yielding hybrid maize in 1914‚Äì1917. Jones' method produced a double-cross hybrid, which requires two crossing steps working from four distinct original inbred lines. Later work by corn breeders produced inbred lines with sufficient vigor for practical production of a commercial hybrid in a single step, the single-cross hybrids. Single- cross hybrids are made from just two original parent inbreds. They are generally more vigorous and also more uniform than the earlier double-cross hybrids. The process of creating these hybrids often involves detasseling. Temperate maize hybrids are derived from two main heterotic groups: Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic, and non stiff stalk.  Rice (Oryza sativa)  Rice production has seen enormous rise in China due to heavy uses of hybrid rice. In China, efforts have generated a super hybrid rice strain (LYP9) with a production capability of ~15 tons per hectare. In India also, several varieties have shown high vigor, including RH-10 and Suruchi 5401.  Hybrid livestock  The concept of heterosis is also applied in the production of commercial livestock. In cattle, crosses between Black Angus and Hereford produce a cross known as a \\"Black Baldy\\". In swine, \\"blue butts\\" are produced by the cross of Hampshire and Yorkshire. Other, more exotic hybrids such as \\"beefalo\\" are also used for specialty markets.  Poultry  Within poultry, sex-linked genes have been used to create hybrids in which males and females can be sorted at one day old by color. Specific genes used for this are genes for barring and wing feather growth. Crosses of this sort create what are sold as Black Sex-links, Red Sex-links, and various other crosses that are known by trade names. Commercial broilers are produced by crossing different strains of White Rocks and White Cornish, the Cornish providing a large frame and the Rocks providing the fast rate of gain. The hybrid vigor produced allows the production of uniform birds with a marketable carcass at 6‚Äì9 weeks of age. Likewise, hybrids between different strains of White Leghorn are used to produce laying flocks that provide the majority of white eggs for sale in the United States.  Dogs  In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds. John Scott and John L. Fuller performed a detailed study of purebred cocker spaniels, purebred basenjis, and hybrids between them. They found that hybrids ran faster than either parent, perhaps due to heterosis. Other characteristics, such as basal heart rate, did not show any heterosis‚Äîthe dog's basal heart rate was close to the average of its parents‚Äîperhaps due to the additive effects of multiple genes.John Paul Scott and John L. Fuller. \\"Genetics and the Social Behavior of the Dog\\". 1965. p. 307 and p. 313. Sometimes people working on a dog breeding program find no useful heterosis.Per Jensen. \\"The Behavioural Biology of Dogs\\". 2007. p. 179 Birds In 2014, a study undertaken by the Centre for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University in Geelong, Victoria concluded that intraspecific hybrids between the subspecies flaveolus and elegans of the Crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) were more likely to fight off diseases than their pure counterparts.  Humans  Human beings are all extremely genetically similar to one another. Michael Mingroni has proposed heterosis, in the form of hybrid vigor associated with historical reductions of the levels of inbreeding, as an explanation of the Flynn effect, the steady rise in IQ test scores around the world during the twentieth century.

Led by Charles of Lorraine, an Imperial force of around 25,000 men was advancing against French- occupied Prague, when it ran into a Prussian army of roughly equal size, commanded by Frederick the Great. Casualties were heavy on both sides, and the battle inconclusive, but it is considered a Prussian victory, as they retained possession of the battlefield. In June, the Treaty of Breslau ended the First Silesian War, allowing Austria to recapture Prague in December. Hostilities resumed in 1744.  Background  Empress Maria Theresa, ca 1762 The War of the Austrian Succession was sparked by the death of Charles VI in 1740 and the succession of his daughter Maria Theresa. Salic law previously excluded women from inheriting the Habsburg Monarchy; the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction set this aside, allowing Maria Theresa to succeed her father. Austria's position as the most powerful element in the Holy Roman Empire was threatened by the growth of Bavaria, Prussia and Saxony, who disputed the validity of the Sanction. With French support, they invaded the Crown of Bohemia, then the most important industrial area in Europe, comprising Silesia, Moravia and Bohemia. Frederick II occupied Silesia; the richest individual province in the Empire, responsible for 10% of total Imperial income, this was a serious blow to Austria. Victory at Mollwitz in April 1741 consolidated Frederick's hold on Silesia, while a French-Bavarian force captured Prague in November. Charles of Bavaria was crowned King of Bohemia, and on 12 February 1742, he became the first non-Habsburg Emperor since 1437. However, in a rare example of an Austrian winter offensive, by the end of February 1742, von Khevenh√ºller occupied much of Bavaria, including Munich, and most of Bohemia. The Austrians also employed guerilla warfare, using irregular troops or Pandurs to attack lines of communication. They inflicted considerable damage on Prussian troops and morale, one officer writing 'these thieves and robbers...never show themselves in battle, like proper brave soldiers.' In response, Frederick moved into Moravia in March; he established himself at ≈Ωidlochovice, which allowed him to threaten Vienna, and devastate the countryside. By stripping garrisons from the rest of Bohemia, the Austrians assembled a field army of 28,000 to retake Prague, under Charles of Lorraine, who had a reputation as a cautious, timid and defensively minded general. Frederick took the offensive, and moved into North-East Bohemia; by 16 May, he had 10,000 infantry at Kutn√° Hora, with 18,000 men under Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau a day's march behind. Charles was thought to be some distance away, but in the afternoon of 16 May, his cavalry ran into Leopold's rearguard. Recognising he was in contact with the Austrian main force, Leopold accelerated his march to close the gap with Frederick. At 2:00 am on 17 May, his exhausted troops stopped at the small village of Chotusice, three hours march from Kutn√° Hora. Battle Battle plan, Chotusitz Instructed to hold until Frederick reached him, Leopold deployed south of Chotusice, his infantry facing south-east, with cavalry on either flank. The left was commanded by Waldow, the right by the 70 year old veteran von Buddenbrock, Leopold leaving room for Frederick's infantry to deploy when they arrived. Charles of Lorraine hoped to attack before Frederick could reach him but was not ready to do so until 7:00 am; as he advanced north from ƒå√°slav, his army drifted slightly to the right, allowing Buddenbrock's cavalry to outflank them. Frederick arrived on the field at 8:00 am; to provide time to organise the infantry, he ordered the Prussian cavalry to charge, supported by field artillery. They drove the Austrian cavalry back, but the day was hot and dry, raising a huge cloud of dust and effectively blinding them. In the confusion, some units attacked in the wrong direction, allowing Karl Josef Batthy√°ny and Liechtenstein to rally their men. Both sets of cavalry began looting each other's baggage trains, an act of collective indiscipline that rendered them useless for much of the battle. The Austrian artillery had been bombarding Chotusice, around 9:00 am, Daun's infantry stormed the town, slowly driving Leopold's forces from house to house. As they did so, they set it on fire, the smoke adding to the confusion caused by the dust, and making exercising command almost impossible. By 10:30, Frederick's fresh infantry were deployed in a great square of 24 battalions; wheeling left, they fired into the Austrian infantry outside Chotusice. His flanks exposed by the cavalry's disappearance, Charles decided to settle for a draw. He ordered a general retreat through ƒå√°slav, leaving some of his heavy guns behind; Liechtenstein's cavalry held off the Prussians, and by noon, combat had ceased. Aftermath Frederick II of Prussia The battle left the basic strategic situation unchanged; Charles was still able to move against Prague, while the Prussian presence in Moravia remained a threat to Vienna. Habsburg policy was generally to avoid fighting on too many fronts at the same time; although Prussia was the most dangerous, but also the most difficult to defeat. Although recovering Silesia remained a Habsburg priority for decades, Maria Theresa was willing to agree a temporary truce with Prussia to improve her position elsewhere. This suited Frederick, who was short of money and men and also suspected France was preparing a separate peace. In June, the Treaty of Breslau ended the First Silesian War; Prussian troops withdrew from Bohemia, and Austria recaptured Prague in December. Like other contemporaries, such as Maurice de Saxe, Frederick concluded morale was more effective in destroying enemy formations than firepower. At Mollwitz, the Austrians fled when faced with the steady, disciplined advance of the Prussian infantry; at Chotusice, it convinced Charles of Lorraine to settle for a draw. When the Second Silesian War began in 1744, Frederick told his officers the infantry had to do only two things; form up quickly, then maintain their formation. The battle also showed the Prussian cavalry still needed work, particularly in horsemanship; a contributory factor to their apparent indiscipline was the inability of many to control their mounts and this became an area of focus after 1743. Von Gessler, who led Buddenbrock's charge, was promoted lieutenant general, and received the Order of the Black Eagle; at Hohenfriedberg in 1745, he commanded the cavalry charge claimed as a key factor in Prussian victory.

It broadcasts on BBC Radio 4 LW (long wave) and local MW (medium wave) frequencies, BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra (digital) and via the internet to the United Kingdom and (where broadcasting rights permit) the rest of the world. TMS provides ball- by-ball coverage of most Test cricket, One Day International, and Twenty20 matches and tournaments involving the England cricket team. History BBC Radio was the first broadcaster to cover every ball of a Test match. Live cricket had been broadcast since 1927, but originally it was thought that Test match cricket was too slow for ball-by-ball commentary to work. However, Seymour de Lotbiniere (\\"Lobby\\"), who was responsible for live sports coverage and who went on to become an outstanding head of outside broadcasts at the BBC, realised that ball-by-ball commentary could make compelling radio. In the mid-1930s he got Howard Marshall to begin commentating on cricket, rather than only giving reports. From the mid-1930s to the 1950s the amount of ball-by- ball commentary gradually increased, but it was not until TMS was launched in 1957 that every ball was covered for their British audience.However, according to EW Swanton full ball-by-ball coverage was first tried experimentally in 1939, with himself, Howard Marshall and Michael Standing as the commentators, but the full coverage only went to the West Indies. EW Swanton, Sort of a Cricket Person, Collins, 1972, p281 of the 1974 Sportsman's Book Club edition. Similarly, in 1948 the BBC provided full ball-by-ball coverage for Australia. Robert Hudson was responsible for the launch of TMS, writing to his Outside Broadcasts boss Charles Max-Muller in 1956, proposing broadcasting full ball- by-ball coverage of Tests rather than only covering fixed periods, and suggesting using the Third Programme (as BBC Radio 3 was then known) frequency, since at that time the Third Programme only broadcast in the evening. TMS became a fixture on BBC Radio 3 on AM medium wave until Radio 3 lost its MW frequency in February 1992. The programme moved to Radio 3 FM that summer and the following summer the morning play was on Radio 5, switching to Radio 3 for the afternoon session. The start of Radio 5 Live meant that TMS moved to its present home on Radio 4 long wave (198 LW, plus various localised MW frequencies including 720 MW in London and 603 MW in the North East). At times of cricket matches, the normal BBC Radio 4 schedule continues on its FM frequencies, whilst longwave is taken over by the cricket. Digital Radio was seen as the solution for \\"where to put\\" TMS and a way for cricket fans to avoid broadcasts of the Shipping Forecast, The Daily Service and Yesterday in Parliament which would otherwise interrupt the cricket. Since 2002 it has been broadcast on Five Live Sports Extra, which is the network the BBC primarily cross-promotes on air. Five Live Sports Extra is also streamed via the Internet (though sometimes only available in the UK due to rights issues). Full commentaries are now available for 30 days on the BBC iPlayer and since late-2015 a \\"live-rewind\\" feature is available. Many spectators who are present at Test matches listen to TMS via headphones attached to portable radios. Fixed frequency radios with radio and/or TV commentary are sometimes available for purchase at grounds. From 1973 to 2007, Test Match Special was produced by Peter Baxter. Halfway through 2007, Baxter retired and was replaced by Adam Mountford, previously the Five Live cricket producer. Mountford was aged just one when Peter Baxter became involved with TMS. Format changes include the addition of daily live weather forecasts and reports on the domestic county championship for home series, plus an end of day summary with Jonathan Agnew and Geoffrey Boycott. After Boycott left Test Match Special in 2020, Agnew now conducts the end of day summary alongside Michael Vaughan. Calypso-tinged theme music from the track \\"Soul Limbo\\" by the American soul band Booker T. & the M.G.s is played at the beginning and end of TMS coverage each day. In December 2008 the BBC won the UK radio rights up to 2013.http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/about-ecb/media-releases/bbc-sport-gain-radio- rights,303608,EN.html ECB media release regarding 2010 ‚Äì 2013 UK radio rights On 26 January 2012 the ECB announced a further six-year deal covering home Tests until 2019 (the next UK Ashes series). In 2017 the ECB agreed a new deal with the BBC to cover England Cricket on Radio from 2020 to 2024 alongside the new rights for BBC TV coverage of Live Twenty20 Cricket and Test Match & ODI International Highlights. The BBC currently covers all winter series too, but did at one stage lose certain rights to TalkSport ‚Äì broadcasting rights for tours are controlled by the host country and it is not uncommon for there to be disputes. In 2001, Agnew was forced to broadcast by mobile phone from Galle Forte, overlooking the Sri Lankan ground, when the BBC were locked out. TMS commentators In a Test match three or four commentators and three or four summarisers are used in rotation; each commentator \\"sits in\\" before the microphone for 20 minutes, and each summariser for 30 minutes, at a time. Some of the commentators have nicknames (a few based on the first syllable of their surname, plus the syllable \\"-ers\\"). They have included: * E. W. Swanton (1938‚Äì1975) * Rex Alston (1945‚Äì1964) * John Arlott (1946‚Äì1980) * Ken Ablack (1950‚Äì1962) * Robert Hudson (1958‚Äì1968) * Peter West (1958) * Alan Gibson (1962‚Äì1975) * Peter Cranmer (1965, 1968 ‚Äì 2 matches only) * Brian Johnston (\\"Johnners\\") (1966‚Äì1993) * Neil Durden-Smith (1969‚Äì1974) * Christopher Martin- Jenkins (\\"CMJ\\") (1973‚Äì2012) * Don Mosey (\\"The Alderman\\") (1974‚Äì1991) * Tony Lewis (\\"ARL\\") (1977‚Äì1985) * David Mercer (1986‚Äì1990) * Jack Bannister (1988‚Äì1994) * Jon Champion (2000‚Äì2003) * Mark Saggers (2001‚Äì2008) * Arlo White (2005‚Äì2009) * Mark Pougatch (2006‚Äì2008) * Simon Hughes (2007‚Äì2010) * Henry Blofeld (\\"Blowers\\") (1974‚Äì1991, 1994‚Äì2017) * Ed Smith (\\"Wordsmith\\") (2012‚Äì2018) Current TMS commentators include: * Jonathan Agnew (\\"Aggers\\") (1991‚Äì) * Simon Mann (1996‚Äì) * Alison Mitchell (2007‚Äì) * Kevin Howells (2007‚Äì) * Charles Dagnall (\\"Daggers\\") (2012‚Äì) * Daniel Norcross (2016‚Äì) * Isa Guha (2018‚Äì) * Henry Moeran (2019‚Äì) * Scott Read (2019‚Äì) Regular summarisers The long-standing pattern of a broadcast is commentary during the over followed by a summary or other comments between overs (usually by retired first-class cricketers). In recent years, this pattern has rather broken down, with comments being made not just between overs but between balls. Past summarisers have included: * Norman Yardley (1956‚Äì1969, 1973) * Trevor Bailey (\\"Boil\\") (1974‚Äì1999) * Fred Trueman (1974‚Äì1999) * David Lloyd (1981‚Äì1991) * Mike Selvey (1984‚Äì2008) * Graeme Fowler (1994‚Äì2005) * Angus Fraser (2002‚Äì2008) * Sir Geoffrey Boycott (\\"Boycs\\") (2005‚Äì2020) Current summarisers include: * Vic Marks (\\"The Vicar\\") (1990‚Äì) * Phil Tufnell (\\"Tuffers\\") (2003‚Äì) * Alec Stewart (2006‚Äì) * Michael Vaughan (\\"Vaughnie\\") (2009‚Äì) * Graeme Swann (\\"Swanny\\") (2014‚Äì) * Ebony Rainford-Brent (2015‚Äì) * Sir Alastair Cook (2019‚Äì) * Mark Ramprakash (2020‚Äì) * Alex Hartley (2020‚Äì) Guest commentators and summarisers In addition, visitors from overseas join the TMS team as commentators or summarisers when their country is touring England or vice versa.

The first was Arthur Wrigley, followed in 1966 by Bill Frindall (affectionately known as \\"the Bearded Wonder\\") whose final Test was England's drawn 2nd Test with India in December 2008. Jo King was used as scorer for overseas tours after Frindall stopped travelling. When Jo was unavailable for the 2006/07 Commonwealth Banks Series finals in Australia, Michael Robinson replaced her for the first final at the MCG. Malcolm Ashton (affectionately known as \\"Ashtray\\") became TMS scorer following Frindall's death in 2009.BBC Sport Online, Ashton joins TMS team (consulted 18 May 2009). South African Andrew Samson was the scorer on overseas tours from the Ashes tour of 2010/11, and took over from Malcolm Ashton in 2014, for the home series against Sri Lanka and India. Andy Zaltzman became the scorer on the Sri Lankan tour of England in 2016., \\"The Ashes 2010: Sky Sports v Test Match Special\\" (consulted 8 December 2012). Having been the scorer on numerous England women's matches, Phil Long made his debut on the programme at the start of the 2019 Cricket World Cup where he and Zaltzman were the scorers. * Arthur Wrigley (1934‚Äì1966) * Bill Frindall (\\"The Bearded Wonder\\" or \\"Bearders\\") (1966‚Äì2008) * Jo King * Michael Robinson * Malcolm Ashton (\\"Ashtray\\") (2009‚Äì2014) * Andrew Samson (2010/11 to date) * Andy Zaltzman (2016 to date) * Phil Long (2019 to date) Producers and reporters The producer from 1973 to June 2007 was Peter Baxter, who was also himself a capable commentator. He succeeded Michael Tuke-Hastings, and on his retirement was succeeded by Adam Mountford., \\" New TMS producer signs on\\" (consulted 8 December 2012). Light-hearted style TMS has always had a distinctively irreverent style. While it takes seriously its role of describing and commenting on the action, there is also much light relief. Brian Johnston, who was as happy on the stage and working in light entertainment presentation as he was in the commentary box, was the master of this style. This could on occasion lead to hilarity in the box, for instance on one occasion in August 1991 at The Oval when Ian Botham was dismissed \\"hit wicket\\" and Agnew said Botham \\"just couldn't quite get his leg over.\\" This remark led both Agnew and Johnston to collapse in a fit of giggles, which was quickly followed by Johnston's giggly chastening, \\"Aggers, do stop it!\\" This clip has become a broadcasting classic and is frequently replayed. In 2005, Radio 5 Live listeners voted it the greatest sporting commentary of all time, with ten times as many votes as \\"they think it's all over\\". Other Johnners classics include, \\"There's Neil Harvey standing at leg-slip with his legs wide apart, waiting for a tickle\\", and \\"...and Ward bowls to Glenn Turner, short, ooh! and it catches him high up on the, er, thigh. That really must have hurt as he's doubled over in pain. I remember when...\\" and after 2 minutes of typical Johnners fill, he continued, \\"Well, he's bravely going to carry on ... but he doesn't look too good. One ball left.\\" Listeners' letters and emails are often read out on air. Brian Johnston was once taken to task by a schoolmistress correspondent, pretending indignation, for saying during a West Indies Test commentary: \\"The bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey.\\" However, on this occasion he was innocent.Martin-Jenkins, p160. Concern about BBC Sport's commitment to maintaining the tone and style of the programme after its 50th anniversary led to an Early Day Motion being tabled in Parliament by Andrew George MP in June 2007. In 2012 Test Match Special's light-hearted style was commented upon by the FARS News Agency, highlighting the \\"leg over\\" incident.english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9106243132 Cakes Brian Johnston started the fad of the public sending cakes to the commentary box. In Johnston's day they were chocolate cakes, whereas now fruit cakes seem to be more popular. Indeed, in 2001 the Queen herself had a fruit cake baked for the TMS team. She said that it was baked \\"under close supervision\\" by her following Jonathan Agnew's light hearted questioning of her as to whether she might have baked it herself. In 2019, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall commissioned a cake featuring the helmets and captains from the England vs. New Zealand teams, delivered and consumed during the World Cup Final. Beards Beards have become a recurring theme during TMS commentary, under the supervision of \\"Bearders\\" himself ‚Äî scorer and statistician. The TMS team receive sporadic missives from Keith Flett, social historian, serial newspaper letter writer and chairman of the Beard Liberation Front, a group dedicated to the removal of a societal prejudice against the facially follically enhanced or bearded. Flett offers his opinions on the state of beards in the game today and his views are frequently discussed on TMS, particularly by Jonathan Agnew, including transformations in the recent and bygone Pakistan cricketers, and most recently with regards to the \\"splendidly hirsute\\" Monty Panesar. Bill Frindall was announced \\"Beard of the Year\\" winner in 2008. Charity There is a tradition that every Saturday of a home Test match the commentators wear a Primary Club tie. Membership of the Primary Club is available to anybody who has been out first ball (a \\"golden duck\\") in any form of cricket. Proceeds are donated to a charity for blind and partially sighted cricketers. View from the Boundary This is a regular Saturday lunchtime feature during home Test Matches, in which guests from all walks of life are interviewed about their love of cricket as well as their own sphere of activity. In the early years of the feature the interviewer was usually Brian Johnston; nowadays most interviews are conducted by Jonathan Agnew. Lily Allen has been interviewed twice and stated a preference for the longer Test form of the game during her first interview on View from the Boundary. Daniel Radcliffe was interviewed on his 18th birthday at the Lord's Test in 2007 after being hunted down by Shilpa Patel, TMS's assistant producer. During the Ashes Test in 2009 at Lord's Patel also attracted the New Zealand actor Russell Crowe into the TMS box, while his cousin, the former Kiwi test cricketer Jeff Crowe, was serving as the match referee. Agnew remarked \\"that we have been joined by the cousin of the match referee\\" live on air.Thanks Johnners: Jonathan Agnew Blue Door Publishing 2010 British prime ministers have been guests, including cricket fans John Major, David Cameron, who was interviewed twice, once as the Leader of Her Majesty's Official Opposition, and Theresa May. Brian Johnston Champagne Moment At the end of each test match, the commentators vote for their favourite special moment in the match, and the player involved wins a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne. Examples include a personal milestone for a player, such as a century or five-wicket haul, a dramatic celebration, or a spectacular piece of fielding, wicket or shot. Criticism In 2008 Mike Selvey was replaced as a TMS summariser as new producer Adam Mountford brought in Phil Tufnell and Michael Vaughan. Selvey then criticised what he described as a shift towards \\"laddish\\" commentators such as Arlo White and Mark Pougatch who have \\"little knowledge of the game, especially of the cadences of Test Match cricket\\". This sentiment was echoed by some of his contemporaries.

He played for the New York Giants (1919‚Äì1926) and St. Louis Cardinals (1927‚Äì1937). He managed the Cardinals (1933‚Äì1938), Pittsburgh Pirates (1940‚Äì1946) and Chicago Cubs (1949‚Äì1951). He is a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. He is tied with Yogi Berra for most World Series doubles at 10 and holds the record for the most World Series hits at 58 for a player who never played for the New York Yankees, exceeded only by Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle. Early life Born in The Bronx, New York City, Frisch attended Fordham Preparatory School, graduating in 1916.Fordham Preparatory School (Hall of Honor) website as to August 20, 2010. He went on to Fordham University where he continued to star in four sports: baseball, football, basketball and track. His speed earned him the nickname \\"The Fordham Flash\\". Baseball Almanac website as of August 20, 2010, and Fordham University 1920 \\"The Maroon\\" Yearbook New York Giants With the Giants, circa 1919 In 1919, Frisch left Fordham Baseball Almanac website as of August 20, 2010, Fordham Preparatory School (Hall of Honor) website as of August 20, 2010 and Fordham University 1920 \\"The Maroon\\" Yearbook to sign with the New York Giants of the National League, moving directly to the majors without playing in the minor leagues. He made an immediate impact, finishing third in the NL in stolen bases and seventh in RBI in 1920, his first full season. Manager John McGraw was so impressed by Frisch that he soon named him team captain, giving him advice in base-running and hitting. The Giants played Frisch at both third base and second base early in his career, but by 1923 he was installed as the team's full-time second baseman. Frisch batted over .300 in his last six seasons with New York. He was also an expert fielder and a skilled base- runner. In 1921, he led the National League with 48 steals, in 1923 in hits, and in 1924 in runs. With Frisch adding his fiery competitiveness to the team, the Giants won the World Series in 1921 and 1922, winning the NL pennant the following two seasons as well. Frisch is tied with Pablo Sandoval for the franchise post-season multi-hit games record of 15. St. Louis Cardinals After the 1926 season, Frisch was traded‚Äîwith pitcher Jimmy Ring‚Äîto the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for star Rogers Hornsby. After an August 1926 loss in which Frisch had missed a sign, costing the Giants a run, McGraw had loudly berated Frisch in front of the team; Frisch responded by leaving the team, and his previously close relationship with McGraw virtually ended. Playing second base for the Cardinals, Frisch appeared in four more World Series (1928, 1930‚Äì31, 1934), bringing his career total to eight. He was the driving force of the \\"Gashouse Gang\\", the nickname for the Cardinals clubs of the early 1930s, which were built around him to reflect his no-holds-barred approach. The Cardinals had won only one pennant before Frisch joined the team; the Giants would win the pennant only once in Frisch's nine seasons as the Cards' regular second baseman. Frisch played eleven seasons with the Cardinals. In 1931, he was voted the Most Valuable Player in the National League after batting .311 with 4 home runs, 82 RBI and leading the League in stolen bases with 28. The 1931 Cardinals also triumphed in the World Series, defeating Connie Mack's defending two-time champion Philadelphia Athletics in seven games. Frisch became player-manager of the Cardinals in 1933, and was named to the NL's first three All-Star teams from 1933-35. In 1934, he managed the Cardinals to another seven-game World Series victory‚Äîthis time over the Detroit Tigers. Frisch finished his playing career in 1937. His career statistics totaled a .316 batting average, still the highest ever for a switch hitter, with 2,880 hits, 1532 runs, 466 doubles, 138 triples, 105 home runs, 728 walks and 1,244 RBI over 2,311 games. He also stole 419 bases in his nineteen playing seasons. His hit total stood as the record for switch-hitters until Pete Rose surpassed it in 1977. Frisch also hit .300 for his career from both sides of the plate; the only other switch-hitter with more than 5,000 at- bats with this distinction is fellow Hall of Famer Chipper Jones. Frankie Frisch was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947. After no players had been selected by the writers in the previous two years (the only elections since 1942), the rules were revised to limit eligibility to those players who had retired after 1921; Frisch was among the first four players to benefit from the more reasonable field of candidates. After his retirement as an active player, Frisch continued to manage the Cardinals, but was never able to capture another pennant. Frisch also had managerial stints with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1940‚Äì46) and the Chicago Cubs (1949‚Äì51), but without the success he had in St. Louis. Frisch's career ledger as a manager shows a 1,138‚Äì1,078 (.514) mark, including the pennant in 1934. He also spent the first two months of the 1949 season as a New York Giants' coach, working under his old double- play partner, Leo Durocher, before leaving June 14 to replace Charlie Grimm as manager of the Cubs. Post-baseball career and death Frisch also worked for several years as a baseball color commentator on radio and television. In 1939, he called games for the Boston Bees and the Boston Red Sox on the Colonial Network, a regional radio network serving five New England states. He also called Giants radio in 1947-48, then worked as a post-game host for the team's telecasts in the 1950s. His broadcasting trademark was worrying about pitchers walking batters: \\"Oh, those bases on balls!\\" After a heart attack in September 1956 forced Frisch to curtail his activities, Phil Rizzuto (recently released by Yankees as a player) filled in for him on Giants post-game shows for the rest of the season. From 1959-61, Frisch teamed with Jack Whitaker to form the backup crew for Saturday Game of the Week coverage on CBS. A number of years after Frisch left the playing field as a manager, he became a member of the Hall of Fame's Committee on Baseball Veterans, which is responsible for electing players to the Hall of Fame who had not been elected during their initial period of eligibility by the Baseball Writers; he later became chairman of the committee. In the years just prior to his death, a number of Frisch's Giants and Cardinals teammates were elected to the Hall; some notable writers, chiefly among them Bill James, have criticized these selections‚Äîincluding Jesse Haines, Dave Bancroft, Chick Hafey, Rube Marquard, Ross Youngs and George Kelly‚Äîwhich include some of the most widely questioned honorees in the Hall's history. Critics have complained that many of these selectees had accomplishments which were less outstanding than those of other players who were bypassed, and were only selected because of Frisch's influence. The grave of Frankie FrischFrisch died in Wilmington, Delaware from injuries suffered from a car accident near Elkton, Maryland a month earlier. He was 74 years old. Frisch had been returning to Rhode Island from the meeting of the Veterans Committee in Florida when he lost control of his car. Frisch died in the same manner as other N.Y. Giant Hall of Famers Mel Ott (1958) and Carl Hubbell (1988). He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. During his lifetime, Frisch used 1898 as his year of birth, although other records (Social Security death index, Census records, World War I Draft registration, and passport application) indicate an 1897 birth. In 1999, he ranked number 88 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,100 Greatest Baseball Players by The Sporting News : A Legendary List by Baseball Almanac and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Frisch among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014. Frisch is mentioned in the poem \\"Line-Up for Yesterday\\" by Ogden Nash: Years later, Nash added a footnote to this stanza: \\"p.s. Thanks to Durocher, now everything's kosher.\\" For many years, he lived at 184 Fenimore Road in the Bonnie Crest neighborhood of New Rochelle, New York. He had two hounds named Flash and Patches who kept him company. Frisch eventually moved to Charlestown, Rhode Island, devoting himself mainly to his interests in gardening and classical music.A Job for the Flash, Time Magazine, June 20, 1949 The Mosholu Baseball Field in Bedford Park, Bronx was renamed to Frank Frisch Field in 1948.

Jacobite forces led by the Stuart exile Charles Edward Stuart defeated a government army under Sir John Cope, whose inexperienced troops broke in the face of a Highland charge. The battle lasted less than thirty minutes and was a huge boost to Jacobite morale. A heavily mythologised version of the story entered art and legend. Background military road through Corrieyairack Pass; control allowed the Jacobites to descend on Edinburgh. In the late 1730s, French statesmen grew increasingly concerned by the expansion of British commercial power but while most agreed the threat had to be dealt with, very few considered the Stuarts a useful tool in that process. Those who did included Louis XV, who backed an invasion of England to restore the Stuarts in February 1744. But storms sank or damaged many of the French warships which were to protect the invasion force from the Royal Navy, and thus the transports never left port. In March, he abandoned these plans and declared war on Britain. Charles Stuart had travelled to France to join the proposed invasion, and despite its failure, he continued to agitate for another attempt. With the bulk of British forces in Flanders and encouraged by the French victory at Fontenoy in April 1745, he sailed for Scotland in July 1745, gambling that, once there, the French would have to support him. Riding, pp. 55‚Äì56 He landed at Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides on 23 July, accompanied only by the companions later known as the Seven Men of Moidart; many of those he contacted advised him to return to France, but enough were eventually persuaded to support him. The most important of these was Donald Cameron of Lochiel, whose tenants provided a large proportion of the Jacobite force. The rebellion was formally launched at Glenfinnan on 19 August. Riding, pp. 98‚Äì99 Sir John Cope, government commander in Scotland, was a competent soldier with between 3,000 and 4,000 troops available, but many were inexperienced recruits. He was hampered by poor intelligence and advice, particularly from the Marquess of Tweeddale, then Secretary of State for Scotland, who consistently underestimated the severity of the revolt. Once Charles' location was confirmed, Cope left his cavalry and artillery at Stirling under Thomas Fowke and marched on Corrieyairack Pass (on the military road between Fort Augustus and Laggan) with his infantry. The pass was the primary access point between the Western Highlands and the Lowlands, and its control would allow Cope to block the route into Eastern Scotland; however, he found the Highlanders already in possession, and withdrew to Inverness on 26 August. Royle, p. 20 Jacobite objectives remained unclear until early September, when Cope learned they were using the military road network to advance on Edinburgh. Concluding that the only way to reach the city first was by sea, his troops were loaded onto ships at Aberdeen. They began disembarking at Dunbar on 17 September but once again he was too late; Charles had entered the Scottish capital earlier the same day, although Edinburgh Castle remained in government hands. Battle Tranent waggonway. Cope was joined at Dunbar by Fowke and the cavalry, who arrived in poor condition. He was determined to bring on a battle, feeling he had sufficient resources to deal with a Jacobite army numbering around 2,000 and, though chiefly composed of fit and hardy men, badly armed. Hearing of Cope's landing, Charles ordered his forces to move north and intercept, the two armies making contact on the afternoon of 20 September; Gardiner's home Bankton House was nearby and Cope used his local knowledge to select his position (see map). His forces were drawn up facing south, with a marshy area immediately in front, park walls protecting their right and cannon behind the embankment of the Tranent waggonway, which crossed the battlefield. The court-martial set up in 1746 to review Cope's conduct agreed the ground was well chosen and the disposition of his troops appropriate. The effectiveness of his army was undermined by various factors, one being the poor quality of some senior officers, including James Gardiner whose regiment of dragoons fled in panic from a small party of Highlanders in the so-called 'Coltbridge Canter' of 16 September. In addition, much of Cope's infantry lacked experience; until May, Lascelles' Regiment had been employed building a military road near Loch Lomond. Finally, his gunners were so poorly trained that he sent a messenger to Edinburgh Castle asking for replacements; these were sent but never reached him.Thomasson and Buist, p. 60 Charles wanted to attack immediately, but Murray argued their charge would be slowed by the marshy ground in front of Cope's centre, exposing the Highlanders to his superior firepower.Thomasson and Buist, p. 52 This assessment was probably correct, but it was the first in a series of fierce arguments between the two that would fatally undermine the Jacobite leadership. Murray convinced the majority that only an attack against the open left flank of Cope's army stood any chance of success, and Robert Anderson, a local farmer's son who knew the area well, told him of a route through the marshlands. At 4 am, the entire Jacobite force began moving three abreast along the Riggonhead defile, east of Cope's position.Thomasson and Buist, pp. 62‚Äì63 Tranent colliery waggonway To prevent a surprise attack during the night, Cope kept fires burning in front of his position and posted no fewer than 200 dragoons and 300 infantry as pickets. A company of Loudon's Highlanders under Macpherson of Cluny had deserted from Cope a few days before; the remaining three companies were detailed to guard the baggage park in Cockenzie, while some 100 volunteers were dismissed until the next morning and missed the battle.Thomasson and Buist, p. 60 Warned by his pickets of the Jacobite movement, Cope had enough time to wheel his army to face east (see map) and reposition his cannon. As the Highlanders began their charge, his artillerymen fled, leaving the guns to be fired by their officers.Thomasson and Buist, pp. 66‚Äì67 Killiecrankie in 1689, the government infantry was over-run by the Highland charge. The two dragoon regiments on the flanks panicked and rode off, leaving Gardiner mortally wounded on the battlefield and exposing the infantry in the centre. Attacked on three sides, they were overrun in less than 15 minutes, with their retreat blocked by the park walls to their rear; some escaped when the Highlanders stopped to loot the baggage train. Government losses were from 300 to 500 killed or wounded and 500 to 600 taken prisoner, many later paroled to save the expense of holding them; the Jacobites estimated their own casualties as 35 to 40 dead and 70 to 80 wounded.Charles, pp. 51‚Äì52 Deserted by his gunners, the artillery commander, Lt-Colonel Whitefoord, made his escape after being spared by Stewart of Invernahyle; he later returned the favour by obtaining a pardon for him after he was captured at Culloden. Cope also escaped and Lascelles fought his way out, although most of his regiment were captured; with Fowke and the dragoons, they reached Berwick-upon-Tweed the next day with 450 survivors. Gardiner was later carried from the field to Tranent, where he died during the night and an obelisk commemorating his death was set up in the mid-19th century.James Gardiner In 1953, a memorial to the dead of both sides was erected near the battle site, with a coal bing providing a vantage point for visitors. Aftermath Colonel Gardiner's Monument Several hours after the battle, Cope wrote to Tweeddale, disclaiming responsibility for the defeat; \\"I cannot reproach myself; the manner in which the enemy came on was quicker than can be described...and the cause of our men taking on a destructive panic...\\" Some observers were more critical; in a letter of 18 October, William Blakeney, an experienced Irish veteran in command at Stirling Castle, questioned Cope's dispositions, pointing out that 'it is a maxim in the art of War, not to place Horse on any Wing of an Army near woods..., from whence they may be annoyed by Infantry without being able to offend them.' Cope, Fowke and Lascelles were later tried by a court- martial; all three were exonerated, with the Court deciding defeat was due to the 'shameful conduct of the private soldiers' but Cope never held a senior command again. As Governor of Gibraltar, Fowke was court-martialled again in 1756 and this time dismissed from the army, although he was reinstated in 1761. The Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 showed that even experienced troops struggled with the ferocity of the Highland charge, a lesson reinforced at Prestonpans and Falkirk Muir in January 1746. Its weakness was that if the initial charge failed, the Highlanders were not equipped to hold their ground; by the time of Culloden in April, Cumberland's troops had been drilled in countering this tactic and inflicted heavy losses on the Scots as a result. Victory meant the rebellion was now taken more seriously; in mid-October, two French ships arrived at Montrose, bringing money, weapons and an envoy, the Marquis d'Eguilles. Riding, p. 195 The Duke of Cumberland and 12,000 troops were recalled from Flanders, including 6,000 German mercenaries who arrived in Berwick-upon-Tweed a few days after Cope. Royle, p. 30 These were immediately available, having been captured at Tournai in June, then released on condition they did not fight against the French. Lord Elcho, p. 256 Contemporary depiction of Cope's arrival in Berwick The argument prior to the battle between Prince Charles and Lord Murray was the first episode in an increasingly fractious relationship and the Jacobite Council spent the next six weeks arguing strategy. Reversing the 1707 Union was a significant factor in Scottish Jacobite support; this now appeared possible, and Charles and his exile advisors argued that only the removal of the Hanoverian regime could ensure the end of the Union, and that meant an invasion of England. The Scots eventually agreed after Charles assured them of substantial English and French support; they left Edinburgh on 4 November, entering England on 8 November; and government forces under General Handasyde retook Edinburgh on the 14th. Riding, pp 199‚Äì201 On the march south, the Council met daily to discuss strategy, and at Derby on 5 December, its members overwhelmingly counselled retreat, the only significant dissenter being Charles. There was no sign of the promised French landing, and despite the large crowds that turned out to see them, only Manchester provided a significant number of recruits; Preston, a Jacobite stronghold in 1715, supplied three. News of another French supply convoy arriving in Montrose seemed to validate the original preference for remaining in Scotland, and the Jacobites turned north the next day. Riding, pp. 304‚Äì305 The rising ended with defeat at Culloden in April 1746. Legacy In 2006, the Battle of Prestonpans 1745 Heritage Trust was established locally to provide information on the battle, while the battlefield site is included in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009. Popular perception of the battle and Cope's role has largely been set by accounts by third parties, none of whom were present and in one case not yet born. In his 1747 book Life of Colonel Gardiner, nonconformist minister Philip Doddridge turned evangelical convert Gardiner into a hero, largely by ridiculing Cope; this is an enduring myth which is still recycled today. Gardiner also features in Sir Walter Scott's 1817 novel Waverley, whose hero is an English Jacobite; Gardiner's heroic death helps convince him that the future lies not with the Stuarts but in the Union. The often-quoted quip by Lord Mark Kerr that Cope was the first general to bring news of his own defeat appears to have been another embellishment by Scott. (However, this is also mentioned in the famous song \\"Hey Johnnie Cope\\", mentioned below.) The best known legacy comes from Skirving, a local farmer who visited the battlefield later that afternoon where he was, by his own account, mugged by the victors. He wrote two songs, \\"Hey, Johnnie Cope, Are Ye Waking Yet?\\" and \\"Tranent Muir\\"; the former is quite well known, and is a short, catchy, and mostly historically inaccurate insult to Cope. The tune is still played by some Scottish regiments for Reveille and was also played as the 51st (Highland) Division disembarked on Juno Beach in Normandy on 6 June 1944. While Cope's troops fled the battle, he himself did not; nor is it true that he slept the night before. Poet Robert Burns later wrote his own words to the song, but these are not as well known as Skirving's. The participants included Allan Breac Stewart, a soldier in Lee's Regiment; he switched sides after being taken prisoner and joined the Jacobite Stewart of Appin's regiment. Scots author Robert Louis Stevenson used him as a lead character in his 1886 novel Kidnapped.Anand, p. 18 In 2019 a new visitor centre was proposed for the battle site. It would permanently house the Prestonpans Tapestry, a depiction of the events leading up to the battle. The site has been partly developed for housing and the former Cockenzie power station. The historical drama television series Outlander depicts the battle during Season 2, episode 10.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4462720/?ref_=ttep_ep10 Notes References Sources  * * ; * ;  ; * External links * Article from The Herald, 29 April 2008, on Historic Scotland's campaign to protect Scotland's battlefields * * Digitised copy of the Battle of Preston September 1745 drawn in 1746 from National Library of Scotland * Digitised copy of the A plan of the battle of Tranent fought Sept 21st 1745 drawn about 1745 from National Library of Scotland * Digitised copy of the A plan of the battle of Preston Pans fought 21st Sept 1745 from National Library of Scotland * Digitised copy of the Sites of the Battles of Pinkie and Prestonpans, and other interesting historical ... from National Library of Scotland * Ascanius; or, the Young Adventurer * Battle of Prestonpans (1745) Heritage Trust * Category:1745 in Great Britain Category:Conflicts in 1745 Prestonpans 1745 Category:1745 in Scotland Category:History of East Lothian Prestonpans ","title":"Battle of Prestonpans"},{"id":"646136","text":"Elisa Carri√≥ votes in the 2007 elections.

Politics Carri√≥ entered politics at the request of her mentor, Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, was elected to the 1994 Constitutional Amendments Convention, during which she was a leading sponsor of Article 75, section 22, which mandated the adoption of international human rights treaties ratified by Argentina into the Argentine Constitution.Diario de Cuyo: Carri√≥ se defendi√≥ She was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for her province, representing the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR), in 1995, and in 1997, obtained passage of a bill giving constitutional authority to the international Treaty of Disappeared Persons.Elisa Carri√≥: Discurso en la sesi√≥n especial donde se rechaz√≥ el ingreso a la C√°mara de Luis Patti She campaigned heavily for Fernando de la R√∫a in 1999. Re-elected to Congress, Carri√≥ earned growing publicity as the chair of the Congressional Committee on Corruption and Money Laundering after 1999, particularly during a series of exchanged accusations in 2001 between herself and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo.Parlamentario: Sigue el contrapunto Carri√≥-Cavallo After the rupture in 2000 of the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (which the UCR had formed in 1997 with Socialists and the Front for a Country in Solidarity), Carri√≥ turned to the Democratic Socialist Party and other politicians with leftist leanings who were discontented in their parties, and formed an informal front, initially called \\"Argentinians for a Republic of Equals\\" (Argentinos por una Rep√∫blica de Iguales), ARI. After dissensions, the socialists left, and so did Carri√≥ and other figures from their original parties. Together, they formed a new party, called Alternative for a Republic of Equals (also Civic Coalition ARI), in 2002. In the 2003 elections, Carri√≥ ran for president with Mendoza deputy Gustavo Guti√©rrez as the candidate for the Civic Coalition ARI party. Prior to running together, she had worked with him in the 2001 Money Laundering Investigation Commission (Spanish: Comisi√≥n investigadora de lavado de dinero). They ended up in the forth place with about 16% of the votes, behind former president Carlos Menem, would-be president N√©stor Kirchner, and minister of economy Ricardo L√≥pez Murphy. After losing the election, she worked on securing the Civic Coalition ARI, which went through a major crisis during the 2003-07 Kirchner presidency, with members unable to settle their differences and several deputies leaving for the National Government. She returned to the Lower House of Congress in 2005, after winning a seat as a National Deputy for the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires with just over 20% of votes. Carri√≥ ran again for the Presidency on the 2007 elections, representing a front called the Civic Coalition.Coalici√≥n C√≠vica (official website).

She won a majority in two of the three largest cities of Argentina (Buenos Aires and Rosario), but she suffered a larger defeat in Buenos Aires Province, the most populous district.

In Argentina, a presidential candidate can win an outright victory by either winning at least 45 percent of the vote, or 40 to 44 percent of the vote while finishing at least 10 points ahead of the runner- up. Following the 2007 election, Carri√≥ announced she would not be running for the presidency again, declaring that she would instead enhance her role as \\"leader of the opposition\\" and seek to become a member of or influence in a future administration following the 2011 elections.La Capital, 30 October 2007. Carri√≥ mantendr√° el liderazgo pero no volver√° a pelear la Presidencia . She was reunited ahead of the June 2009 mid-term elections with erstwhile allies, the UCR and Socialists, in the Civic and Social Agreement. This coalition yielded gains only for the UCR, however, and Carri√≥'s reduced influence therein ended in her acrimonious departure from the group in August 2010. She later reconsidered her earlier decision to opt out of the 2011 presidential race, and on December 12, 2010, she announced her candidacy on the Civic Coalition/ARI ticket.de Prensa / Gacetillas Elisa Carri√≥: Se lanz√≥ la candidatura de Carri√≥-P√©rez Carri√≥ received 1.8% of the vote in the 23 October election, placing last in a field of seven candidates.

Her desire to fold UNEN into a coalition led by the PRO party, led to her break with UNEN in November 2014. The UCR also left the coalition and joined the PRO as well. The three parties became a new coalition, Cambiemos (). She run for the presidency in the primary elections, and lost to Mauricio Macri. Macri won the 2015 general elections afterwards.

Frederick's Prussian army decisively defeated an Austrian army under Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine on 4 June 1745 during the Second Silesian War (part of the War of the Austrian Succession).  Background  Austria sought to regain Silesia, which had been lost to Prussia in the Battle of Mollwitz. An Austrian army of about 62,500, including allied Saxon troops marched to Silesia. The commander was Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, brother-in-law of Empress Maria Theresa. Johann Adolf II, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels commanded the Saxons. Frederick had a very low opinion of his counterpart, saying of Prince Charles Alexander that \\"there will be some stupid mistakes.\\" In fact, Frederick was counting on Charles entering Silesia by crossing the Riesengebirge (engl. Giant Mountains). If he did, Frederick intended to attack the Austrian army and crush it in one decisive blow. Hans Joachim von Zieten's Zieten-Hussars shadowed the Austrian army, keeping Frederick informed of their movements and position as he awaited the right moment to strike. When the Prince finally did cross in early June, Frederick saw his opportunity to attack. The Austrian army marched some northeast from the Riesengebirge to Striegau (now Strzegom). They encamped near Striegau, with the Saxons just northwest of the town at Pilgrimshain and the Austrians spreading out west and south to the village of Hohenfriedberg. Their front was covered by the Striegau River, which ran north and then west through Striegau town. The Prussian army was camped south of the town. Prussian scouts located the Austro-Saxon forces. Frederick decided to march north with his whole force, right in front of the Austrians, cross the Striegau by a bridge just west of town, and attack the Saxons first. With the Saxons routed, Frederick would then roll up the Austrian line from east to west. He also decided to march by night, concealing his movement, and thus surprise the Saxons. One of Frederick's generals, Richard de Moulin led the march. To achieve surprise, Frederick ordered his troops to leave their campfires burning and tents pitched, and forbade them to talk or smoke during the march.  Battle  Map of the Battle Frederick's plan soon encountered difficulties. There was not enough space for all of the Prussian troops on the designated route. A bottleneck soon developed at the bridge over the Striegau, so only limited forces were able to make it over. The first Prussian objective was two hills in front of the Saxon lines. The Saxon army had occupied these two hills the previous day with a small force. The Prussian vanguard encountered this force; the resulting clash alerted the Saxons and prevented the complete surprise Frederick hoped for. De Moulin decided to bypass the hills and strike right at the Saxon camp before the Saxons could deploy. The Prussian attack began at about 7:00 AM. Some Saxon cavalry got out on the field, but the Prussian cavalry soon charged and routed them. The Prussian infantry then stormed the Saxon camp, defeating the few Saxon infantry that managed to deploy, and also a few Austrian troops. The easterly wind, blowing smoke and dust into the Saxons' faces, was also advantageous for the Prussians. The entire left (Saxon) half of the Austro-Saxon army was destroyed in the hours of the dawn's light. By then the Austrians were alerted to the battle. From their camps further to the south and more protected by the river, Austrian troops moved to the front. The Prussians who had still not crossed the Striegau to the north wheeled to the west and advanced through river crossings wherever they could find them, finding enough fords to accomplish this. A bridge collapse at the small town of Graben forced the cavalry commander, Hans Joachim von Zieten, to find a ford further south through which to funnel cavalry and pack mules carrying supplies. The Austrian cavalry were the first Austrian troops to get into action, but they were broken and driven off by the charge of the Prussian cavalry. The Austrian infantry formed two lines of battle facing east, from Hohenfriedberg north. Though the Prussians now had the advantage of numbers, the Austrians resisted stubbornly, with many volleys exchanged at close range. At this point the Prussian Bayreuth Dragoons, an oversize unit numbering around 1,500 men, entered the battle. A strong gust of wind blew away the powder smoke and the dust and revealed an opening in the Austrian lines through which to charge the vulnerable Austrian infantry. The dragoons deployed into line, and attacked north against the right flank of the first Austrian line. They drove all the way along that line, routing it completely, then turned south to destroy the second Austrian line. The Austrians, already outnumbered, abandoned by their Saxon allies, without cavalry protection, and now broken by this attack, began to surrender en masse. The Bayreuth Dragoons defeated several thousand Austrian infantry and only suffered 94 casualties. The Dragoons overran twenty battalions, took 2,500 prisoners, capturing 67 flags and standards as well as four cannons in what is considered and celebrated as one of the great cavalry battlefield triumphs.Williams, H. S., editor.The Historians' History of the World: Germanic empires (concluded), London, 1907, p. 179. The battle ended with the complete defeat of the Austro- Saxon army. The Austrians and Saxons lost almost 9,000 killed and wounded, about 5,000 prisoners, including four generals, and 66 guns. The Prussians lost around 5,000.  Aftermath and legacy  Hohenfriedberg was a great victory for Frederick, and soon he was being called \\"Frederick the Great\\" by his contemporaries. The charge of the Bayreuth Dragoons was studied by later Prussian and German officers as a model for aggressiveness, and the entire spirit of aggressiveness that Frederick the Great had instilled in his army as well as the large amount of autonomy given to his officers was likened to the tradition of Auftragstaktik. A delighted Fredrick wrote \\"there has not been so decisive a defeat since Blenheim\\". Charles of Lorraine was defeated again, as he had been at the Battle of Chotusitz. This battle showed that the Prussians could crush a numerically equal enemy. The Second Silesian War, which was the last part of the War of the Austrian Succession in which Prussia took part, was almost at an end, and despite a close call at the Battle of Soor against the Austrians (who were again led by Charles of Lorraine), the peace at Dresden was signed on 25 December 1745, soon after yet another Prussian victory at the Battle of Kesselsdorf against the Saxons. The Hohenfriedberger March was composed in honor of this victory, allegedly by Frederick himself.

Prosobranchia was a large taxonomic subclass of sea snails, land snails and freshwater snails. This taxon of gastropods dates back to the 1920s. It has however been proven to be polyphyletic (consisting of more than one lineage of descent). Generally speaking in biology taxonomy is required to reflect phylogeny, in other words the classification of a group must reflect its evolutionary descent, as far as that is known, so the taxon Prosobranchia is no longer considered suitable to be used. One can still encounter this subclass used as if it is still valid in many texts and websites. Although Prosobranchia is no longer generally accepted as a taxon by people who study living Mollusca, still the term prosobranch is legitimately used as an anatomically descriptive adjective or noun, and the taxon Prosobranchia is still sometimes used by paleontologists. Prosobranch means gills in front (of the heart). In contrast opisthobranch means gills behind (and to the right of the heart). Prosobranchs have their gills, mantle cavity and anus situated in front of their heart. Most prosobranchs have separate sexes. The majority of marine gastropods are prosobranch, as are a few land snails and freshwater snails. The prosobranch gastropods include the majority of marine snails, among them conches, cones, cowries, limpets, murexes, periwinkles, volutes and whelks, as well as numerous freshwater groups, and some land snails with an operculum. Description shell of a Harpa species, a prosobranch gastropod. Chicoreus ramosus, a prosobranch gastropod. The majority of prosobranchs have an operculum, a corneous or calcareous plate situated on the dorsal surface of the foot. In many prosobranchs, the animal can completely close the aperture with the operculum. The nervous system of prosobranchs is twisted into a figure 8 due to a developmental process known as torsion. The eyes are situated at the base of the tentacles. Taxonomic context The taxonomy of the gastropods is changing rapidly. The old classification (Johannes Thiele) divided Gastropoda into three subclasses: Prosobranchia, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata. The subclass Prosobranchia (Henri Milne- Edwards) was further divided into the orders Archaeogastropoda, Mesogastropoda and Neogastropoda. The new version of the gastropod classification is explained in Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder & Lindberg, 1997). References *Thiele, J., 1929-1935.

He was also the longest serving commentator for Test Match Special (TMS) on BBC Radio, from 1973 until diagnosed with terminal cancer in January 2012. Early life Christopher Martin-Jenkins was born at his grandmother's house in Peterborough, the second of three boys. His father, a Lieutenant Colonel in the army at the time, relocated the family to Glasgow where he was stationed. After demobilisation he returned to his job at the shipping firm Ellerman Lines where he subsequently became Chairman. His mother was a radiologist and GP, working in the Gorbals during the war. School He went to St Bede's prep school in Eastbourne and then to Marlborough. He first played for the school team in 1962 under the captaincy of future Sussex Captain (1968‚Äì1972) and chairman of MCC (2012‚Äì2013), Mike Griffith. The following year, after becoming captain of the school cricket XI, Martin-Jenkins wrote to Brian Johnston asking him how to become a cricket commentator. Johnston invited him to Broadcasting House, took him out to lunch and told him to develop his ability and review his performance by practising his commentating skills by using a tape recorder. That year he also scored a valiant 99 in Marlborough's second innings in the annual fixture against Rugby School at Lord's, but despite this they still lost by 22 runs. University He went to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he read modern history and graduated with a 2.1 in 1967. During his time at Cambridge he won two half-blues for rugby fives but never played for the University cricket first XI, although he narrowly missed out on gaining his blue after he was named 12th man for the 1967 Varsity match at Lord's. Nevertheless, he skippered the Crusaders (the University 2nd XI) during 1966 and 1967 and was also a successful captain of his college XI. He had a great talent for mimicry, which enabled him to progress to final auditions for the Cambridge University Footlights, where his performance was adjudicated by such luminaries as Germaine Greer, Eric Idle and Clive James. Cricketer He played one Second XI Championship match for Surrey against Warwickshire at the Oval in 1971. Thereafter he appeared for the Sir Paul Getty XI in ten one-day games at Wormsley between 1992 and 2002, with a valedictory appearance, aged 61, against the Heartaches team run by Tim Rice in 2006. Media career Following his graduation in 1967 Martin-Jenkins joined The Cricketer magazine as deputy editor under EW Swanton. In March 1970 he left to join the BBC Radio Sports News department and subsequently commentated on his first match, a one-day international between England and Australia, in 1972. His last commentary, 40 years later, was for TMS on England's third Test against Pakistan in Dubai in February 2012. He joined the TMS team in 1973 and was appointed cricket correspondent in succession to Brian Johnston in 1973 and worked as cricket correspondent for the BBC (1973‚Äì1980, 1985‚Äì1991), the Daily Telegraph (1990‚Äì1999) and The Times (1999‚Äì2008). Mike Atherton replaced him as The Times Chief Cricket Correspondent on 1 May 2008 although CMJ continued contributing to the Times cricket pages, filing his last article on the death of Tony Greig on 31 December, the day prior to his own death. He was also a BBC TV commentator for their cricket coverage between 1981 and 1985, before returning to radio. His Daily Telegraph obituarist wrote of his radio commentary that: \\"Nobody excelled him... in what he regarded as the first duty: that of giving a precise, clear, well-informed and accurate account of every ball that was bowled and every stroke that was played.\\" Scyld Berry wrote: \\"What made him so good as a radio commentator, apart from his precise and unforced diction, was that he came closer than anyone to combining the knowledge of an expert with the enthusiasm of a student.\\" By temperament conciliatory, he was rarely involved in controversy. However, during a Test on England's 1989‚Äì90 tour of the West Indies he criticised the umpire Lloyd Barker, claiming that he had allowed himself to be pressurised by the West Indies captain, Viv Richards, into wrongly giving Rob Bailey out caught down the leg side. Barker threatened to sue, believing incorrectly that Martin-Jenkins had called him a cheat. The case was settled by the BBC without going to court. He was renowned among his broadcasting colleagues for a certain vagueness regarding practical matters. Jonathan Agnew described how on one occasion he arrived at Lord's for a match which unfortunately was due to be played on the other side of London at the Oval.Article in The Times by Jonathan Agnew He also struggled with modern technology, once mistaking the television remote control in his hotel room for his mobile phone. When attempting to email a report to his newspaper, he would occasionally press the Delete button rather than the Send button, causing him much consternation. Author Martin-Jenkins was the author of The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers. Altogether he wrote or edited 25 books including The Wisden Book of County Cricket (1981); Bedside Cricket (1981); Twenty Years On: Cricket‚Äôs years of change (1984); Cricket: a way of life (1984); Grand Slam (1987); Cricket Characters (1987); Sketches of a Season (1987); and Ball by Ball: The Story of Cricket Broadcasting (1990) and finally concluding with his autobiography, CMJ ‚Äì A Cricketing Life. He edited The Cricketer from 1980 and was President of the Cricket Society from 1998 to 2008. Awards and honours He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours. He was President of MCC for 2010‚Äì11, a rare honour for a journalist. His time in office was a difficult one, as it coincided with the ¬£400 million redevelopment plan for Lord's being dropped in favour of something better suited to the difficult economic situation. This led to an as yet unresolved split in the membership between those in favour of the new plan and those who still support the old one. In 2007 he was invited to deliver the annual MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture, becoming the only career journalist and broadcaster to do so. As MCC President, in 2011 he invited Kumar Sangakkara to deliver the same lecture, the only actively playing cricketer to have delivered a Cowdrey Lecture. Personal life He met Judy Hayman at Cambridge and they married in April 1971. They had two sons, James and Robin, and a daughter, Lucy. Robin Martin-Jenkins played county cricket for Sussex before retiring in 2010, while elder brother James played club cricket for Radley Rangers from 1993 to 2006. Death During 2009 and 2010 his health seemed to be declining when he had a bad bout of pneumonia, followed by acute hepatitis. He was subsequently diagnosed with terminal cancer in March 2012, shortly after returning from commentating duties in the UAE, and was forced to step down from Test Match Special due to his illness. He died of lymphoma, at his home in Horsham, on the morning of 1 January 2013, at the age of 67.Daily Telegraph, 17 April 2013, \\"Six England captains bid farewell to CMJ\\" by Derek Pringle, pp S12-3. A statement from his family said: \\"Christopher died peacefully at home this morning after his brave resistance to cancer. The family is extremely proud of all that he did to pass on his love of cricket worldwide with his gift of communicating through the spoken and written word. He was above all a much loved husband, brother, father and grandfather.\\" A memorial service was held in St. Paul's Cathedral on 16 April 2013, attended by 2,000 people including at least six former England captains. The service included readings by his sons, James and Robin, and tributes by Sir Tim Rice and Jonathan Agnew. After the service there was a reception at Lord's.

It is caused by the release (degranulation) of substances from mast cells or basophils under the influence of anaphylatoxins. It causes difficulty in breathing which ranges from mild to severe. Bronchospasms occur in asthma, chronic bronchitis and anaphylaxis. Bronchospasms are a possible side effect of some drugs: pilocarpine, beta blockers (used to treat hypertension), a paradoxical result of using LABA drugs (to treat COPD), and other drugs. Bronchospasms can present as a sign of giardiasis. Bronchospasms are one of several conditions associated with cold housing. Some of the things that can cause bronchospasms are: consuming foods, taking medicines, allergic responses to insects, and fluctuating hormone levels, particularly in women. A few of the more common allergens are foods such as eggs, milk, peanuts, walnuts, tree and other nuts, fish, especially shellfish, soy and wheat; insect bites and stings, especially bee stings; and other medicines, especially penicillin and its derivatives. The overactivity of the bronchioles' muscle is a result of exposure to a stimulus which under normal circumstances would cause little or no response. The resulting constriction and inflammation causes a narrowing of the airways and an increase in mucus production; this reduces the amount of oxygen that is available to the individual causing breathlessness, coughing and hypoxia. Bronchospasms are a serious potential complication of placing a breathing tube during general anesthesia. When the airways spasm or constrict in response to the irritating stimulus of the breathing tube, it is difficult to maintain the airway and the patient can become apneic. During general anesthesia, signs of bronchospasm include wheezing, high peak inspiratory pressures, increased intrinsic PEEP, decreased expiratory tidal volumes, and an upsloping capnograph (obstructive pattern). In severe cases, there may be complete inability to ventilate and loss of ETCO2 as well as hypoxia and desaturation. Cause Bronchospasm are caused by a number of reasons. Lower respiratory tract conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema can result in contraction of the airways. Other causes are side effects of topical decongestants such as oxymetazoline and phenylephrine. Both of these medications activate alpha-1 adrenergic receptors that result in smooth muscle constriction. Non-selective beta blockers are known to facilitate bronchospasm as well. Beta blockers bind into the Œ≤2 receptors and block the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine from binding to its receptors, causing shortness of breath. Diagnosis Signs and symptoms: * Wheezing * Diminished breath sounds * Prolonged expiration * Increase airway pressures (in ventilated patients) Treatment Beta 2 agonists Beta2-adrenergic agonists are recommended for bronchospasm. *Short acting (SABA) **Terbutaline **Salbutamol **Levosalbutamol *Long acting (LABA) **Formoterol **Salmeterol *Others **Dopamine **Norepinephrine **Epinephrine - titrate to effect (e.g. 10-50 mcg IV), especially in setting of hemodynamic compromise **increasing anesthetic depth **IV magnesium **Increase FiO2 to 100% and consider manual ventilation Muscarinic Acetylcholine receptor antagonist The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is known to decrease sympathetic response by slowing the heart rate and constricting the smooth muscle tissue. Ongoing research and successful clinical trials have shown that agents such as diphenhydramine, atropine and Ipratropium bromide (all of which act as receptor antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) are effective for treating asthma and COPD-related symptoms.

She is married to fellow Survivor contestant of Survivor: Marquesas, All-Stars, Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains and winner of Survivor: Redemption Island, Rob Mariano, with whom she appeared in The Amazing Race twice, where they placed 2nd and 8th, respectively, as well as Survivor: Winners at War. Personal life Born in the Pittsburgh suburb of Beaver, Pennsylvania, Amber Brkich went to Beaver Area High School. She is a graduate of Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, north of Pittsburgh, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in public relations, with a minor in speech communications, in 2000. She is an alumna of Alpha Gamma Delta, having served as vice president and new member coordinator while still in school. She is of Croatian and Albanian descent on her paternal side. She began a relationship with fellow reality star Rob Mariano in 2003, when they formed an alliance as castmates on Survivor: All-Stars. They became engaged on May 9, 2004, during the show's live finale at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and married on April 16, 2005 at Atlantis Paradise Island in The Bahamas. CBS aired a two-hour special about the wedding, entitled Rob and Amber Get Married, on May 24, 2005. After their marriage, the couple moved to Pensacola, Florida. They have four daughters: Lucia Rose (born July 4, 2009), Carina Rose (born December 10, 2010), Isabetta Rose (born May 5, 2012), and Adelina Rose (born June 20, 2014). Their family are members of the Catholic Church. Survivor The Australian Outback Brkich was a participant in the second season of Survivor, having auditioned for the season on a whim. She was a member of the green Ogakor tribe, and she was quick to fortify a strong friendship with fellow contestant Jerri Manthey, who helped construct an alliance with Colby Donaldson and Mitchell Olson. Upon the merge, Ogakor managed to use the knowledge that one of Kucha's members, Jeff Varner, had received votes beforehand, and eliminated him, thus gaining a numeric advantage over the other group. Later in the game however, it was decided by a majority of the remaining players that Brkich had played \\"under-the-radar\\", and she was sent home, ultimately landing in sixth place. As a member of the jury, she cast her vote for Donaldson, who lost to Tina Wesson in a 4‚Äì3 vote. Immediately following her appearance on Survivor: The Australian Outback, Brkich appeared on the cover of Stuff magazine. Maxim ranked her as the 50th most beautiful woman in the world in 2004 and 73rd in 2005. She also appeared in various commercials for Adelphia Cable, Rite Aid drugstores, and Mountaineer Racetrack in West Virginia. All-Stars Brkich was a member of the Chapera tribe, a group including Rob Mariano, Sue Hawk, and fellow The Australian Outback player Alicia Calaway. In the season's premiere episode, Mariano and Brkich agreed to form an alliance. They faced their first Tribal Council in the fourth episode, and their relationship was a matter of discussion; but ultimately, it was Rob Cesternino who was sent home. Due to a twist that dissolved one of the three tribes, Jenna Lewis and Rupert Boneham joined the Chapera tribe leading to Mariano and Brkich quickly fortifying a long-term alliance with the duo. Mid-game, a tribal shuffle managed to swap every contestant to the opposite tribe with the exception of Brkich, who remained on the Chapera tribe with Lex van den Berghe, Shii Ann Huang, Jerri Manthey, and Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien. The tribe went on to lose the next challenge and upon leaving, Mariano informed van den Berghe that he would take care of him if he took care of Brkich. Van den Berghe, Huang, and Vavrick-O'Brien voted out Manthey in hopes that Mariano would keep his word. After the merge, van den Berghe was voted out despite Mariano promising to take care of him. Mariano and Brkich also managed to maintain several \\"alliances,\\" including their agreement with Boneham and Lewis, one with \\"Big Tom\\" Buchanan, and one with Calaway. Eventually, the pair ended up in the Final Four with Lewis and Boneham. Once there, Brkich won her first individual Immunity challenge, and she and Mariano convinced Lewis to vote out Boneham instead of forcing a tie. In the final three, Mariano won immunity and chose Brkich to continue with him to the Final Two. Facing the jury, they both met criticism for their gameplay. Ultimately, Brkich was victorious by becoming the Sole Survivor in a 4‚Äì3 vote, securing her the winner by receiving votes from van den Berghe, Calaway, Huang, and Buchanan while Mariano received votes from Vavrick-O'Brien, Boneham and Lewis. Before the vote was read, Mariano proposed to Brkich, which she accepted without hesitation. Winners at War After a 16-year and 32-season hiatus, Brkich, now using her married name of Mariano, returned to compete on the show's first all-winners season alongside her husband, Rob.Meet the cast of Survivor: Winners at War Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved December 19, 2019Jeff Probst shares intel on Survivor: Winners at War Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved December 19, 2019 She was a member of the Dakal tribe. After they lost the second immunity challenge, Mariano became the second contestant voted off as well as the second person sent to the Edge of Extinction. She lost the two Edge return challenges to Tyson Apostol and Natalie Anderson respectively and then became a permanent member of the jury on day 35. Her placement dropped down to 20th after the first boot Anderson won the second re-entry duel. Mariano voted for Tony Vlachos to win the season, which he did in a 12-4-0 vote and become the second two-time winner in Survivor history. The Amazing Race Season 7 As an engaged couple, Mariano and Brkich participated in the seventh season of The Amazing Race and came in second place. During a Roadblock challenge in Mendoza, Argentina, in the third leg of the race, contestants had to eat four pounds of meat. Mariano began the roadblock but very quickly determined he would not or could not eat that quantity. The penalty for not finishing the Roadblock was a 4-hour delay. By convincing several other contestants to refuse to participate, he ensured that several contestants were on the same timetable as he and Brkich. Also in South America, Mariano pooled his money with some other racers to bribe the bus driver to let the teams that contributed off earlier. When he did bribe the driver, Mariano used none of his own money. In Botswana, during the sixth leg of the race, the couple was criticized by fellow racers, as well as host Phil Keoghan, when they drove by the car accident of another team, brothers Brian and Greg, without stopping. Their fellow competitors all checked in with the brothers prior to continuing on to the next stage of the race. Mariano and Brkich ultimately finished in second place behind married couple Uchenna and Joyce. Amongst fans, there has been much speculation surrounding the final leg of the race. It has been argued that the production crew had intervened with the airport authorities and aided Uchenna and Joyce onto the same earlier plane as Mariano and Brkich. In the \\"Revisiting the Race\\" special feature on the Season 7 DVD, Mariano, along with Uchenna and Keoghan denied these accusations. Mariano describes Uchenna running around frantically trying to get onto the flight, which the final edited version of the show does not portray. Keoghan cites the fact that the decision to re-open the door rested solely with the pilot, and that intervention by the production crew would have resulted in someone leaking such information out. Although Mariano and Brkich lost the one million dollar grand prize and \\"The Amazing Race 7\\" winners' title at the final leg of the race, they managed to place 1st in the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 10th legs. They were the only team to not come in last place on any legs of the race. All- Stars In 2007, the Marianos competed on the All-Stars season of The Amazing Race as newlyweds. After achieving first place for the first three legs, they came in last and were eliminated in the season's fourth episode which aired on March 11, 2007. Rob and Amber: Against the Odds In 2006, the Marianos filmed a ten-episode show for the Fox Reality Channel, Rob and Amber: Against the Odds, which aired in 2007. Set in Las Vegas, the show follows Rob's attempt to become a professional poker player and features professional player Daniel Negreanu tutoring him.

Along with Frank Wilczek and David Politzer, he was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery of asymptotic freedom. Gross is the Chancellor‚Äôs Chair Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and was formerly the KITP director and holder of their Frederick W. Gluck Chair in Theoretical Physics . He is also a faculty member in the UC Santa Barbara Physics Department and is currently affiliated with the Institute for Quantum Studies at Chapman University in California. He is a foreign member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Biography Gross was born to a Jewish family in Washington, D.C., in February 1941. His parents were Nora (Faine) and Bertram Myron Gross (1912‚Äì1997). Gross received his bachelor's degree and master's degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, in 1962. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966, under the supervision of Geoffrey Chew. He was a Junior Fellow at Harvard University, and a Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Princeton University until 1997, when he began serving as Princeton's Thomas Jones Professor of Mathematical Physics Emeritus. He has received many honors, including a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1987, the Dirac Medal in 1988 and the Harvey Prize in 2000. He has been a central figure in particle physics and string theory. In 1973, Professor Gross, working with his first graduate student, Frank Wilczek, at Princeton University, discovered asymptotic freedom‚Äîthe primary feature of non-Abelian gauge theories‚Äîled Gross and Wilczek to the formulation of quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong nuclear force. Asymptotic freedom is a phenomenon where the nuclear force weakens at short distances, which explains why experiments at very high energy can be understood as if nuclear particles are made of non-interacting quarks. The flip side of asymptotic freedom is that the force between quarks grows stronger as one tries to separate them. Therefore, the closer quarks are to each other, the less the strong interaction (or color charge) is between them; when quarks are in extreme proximity, the nuclear force between them is so weak that they behave almost as free particles. This is the reason why the nucleus of an atom can never be broken into its quark constituents. QCD completed the Standard Model, which details the three basic forces of particle physics‚Äîthe electromagnetic force, the weak force, and the strong force. Gross was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, with Politzer and Wilczek, for this discovery. Gross, with Jeffrey A. Harvey, Emil Martinec, and Ryan Rohm also formulated the theory of the heterotic string. The four were whimsically nicknamed the \\"Princeton String Quartet.\\"String Theory, at 20, Explains It All (or Not). NY Times (2004-12-07) He continues to do research in this field at the KITP.

Gross is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May of 2008, urging him to \\"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy‚Äôs Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In 2015, Gross signed the Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting.

Uruguay has a legacy of artistic and literary traditions, especially for its small size. The culture of Uruguay is known to be heavily European influenced, mostly by the contribution of its alternating conquerors, Spain and Portugal. However, from the year 1857 to 1940, large waves of European immigrants began arriving to Uruguay, with the majority of the immigrants coming from Italy. Minor European immigrant groups ‚Äì Frenchmen, Germans, Swiss, Russians, Jews, and Armenians, among others ‚Äì as well migrated to Uruguay. With the settlement of the European immigrants, this has resulted in traditions that integrate this diversity with the indigenous people or Charr√∫a elements. Uruguay has century-old remains and fortresses of the colonial era. Its cities have a rich architectural heritage, and a number of writers, artists, and musicians. Carnaval and candombe are the most important examples of African influence by slaves, as well as Umbanda religious beliefs and practices. Guarani traditions can be seen in the national drink, mate. The culture in Uruguay is very similar to that of the culture of Argentina. Visual arts Painting and sculpture The Casapueblo, one of Carlos P√°ez Vilar√≥ most famous art piece Well-known Uruguayan painters include realists such as Juan Manuel Blanes, constructivists such as Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a, nativists like Carlos Mar√≠a Herrera, post-impressionists such as Pedro Figari and Felipe Seade, abstract artists such as Carlos P√°ez Vilar√≥, and numerous others. Jos√© Belloni: The Struggle, 1965 Well-known sculptors include realists Pablo Atchugarry, Jos√© Belloni, and Jos√© Luis Zorrilla de San Mart√≠n, as well as contemporary sculptors such as Juan Jos√© Calandria, √Ågueda Dicancro, Hugo Nantes, Claudio Silveira Silva, Mariv√≠ Ugolino, and Carlos P√°ez Vilar√≥, who created an internationally renowned \\"livable sculpture\\", Casapueblo. Architecture Due to European migration, new forms of art and design started to enter during the formation of Uruguay. Many buildings in Uruguay are European influenced, for example, the Palacio Salvo was designed by Italian architect Mario Palanti. Many well recognized architects around the world are Uruguayan. Some famous Uruguayan architects include Juan Antonio Scasso, Juan Giuria, Leopoldo Artucio, Eladio Dieste, and Carlos Ott. Rafael Vi√±oly is a Uruguayan architect known for his most recognized project being the 432 Park Avenue in New York City. The building stands at 1,396 feet (425.5 m) with 96 floors, making it the tallest residential building in the world. He is also credited for designing other buildings such as the Tokyo International Forum, Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, and Uruguay's international airport Carrasco International Airport. Modern society Immigration A map showing European immigration around the world, with the majority of Uruguay (and parts of Argentina and southern Brazil, respectively) having more than 90% of European ancestry Among the several peoples who settled Uruguay and formed the backbone of its society must be highlighted Spaniards and Italians, together with some descendants of African slaves. While Spaniards being the greatest contributor to other South American countries, Italians are arguably the greatest contributor to Uruguay. There are also significant minorities: Armenians, Austrians, Basque, Britons, Bulgarians, Croats, French, Germans, Greeks, Gypsies, Hungarians, Irish, Scots, Jews, Lebanese, Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, Slovaks, Slovenes, Swiss, and Ukrainians. There are very small Asian communities, mainly from China, Japan and Korea. Languages Spanish is the official language of Uruguay, and is spoken by almost all of the population. The Spanish spoken in Uruguay is more commonly known as Rioplatense Spanish, the same Spanish that is spoken in parts of Argentina. Rioplatense Spanish is known by many in South America as Spanish spoken with an Italian accent, due to Italian effects on modern day Uruguayan society. Minority languages in Uruguay include Italian, French, German, Hebrew, and other European languages. English is also considered a minority language, though it is more used in the business world. Other languages include Portuguese and Portu√±ol, a mixture of Spanish and Portuguese (pidgin language). Both are present in northern regions near the Brazilian border. Gestures Uruguayan gestures are mostly adopted from Southern European culture, with hand gestures and tones being all used commonly throughout the country. A gesture that is only specifically used in Argentina and Uruguay is males kissing other males on the cheek, sometimes both cheeks, as a way of greeting. For the rest of Latin America, kissing on cheek as a form of greeting is mostly towards a male and female, or a female to another female. Popular culture Music The Tango, which originated in the areas of Argentina and Uruguay Uruguayans enjoy music such as tango, folk, and waltz as well as local forms such as candombe, milonga and murga. Both tango and candombe have been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Uruguay's annual Carnival is a major event with many unique features distinguishing it from those of its neighbours. Rock, jazz, pop and other international genres also enjoy great popularity in Uruguay. Motion pictures The first Uruguayan motion picture is \\"Carrera de bicicletas en el vel√≥dromo de Arroyo Seco\\". The film was directed by F√©lix Oliver, the pioneer of cinematography in Uruguay. The best reviewed Uruguayan movie is the 2004 film, Whisky. Directed by Juan Pablo Rebella and Pablo Stoll, with a starring cast of Andr√©s Pazos, Mirella Pascual, and Jorge Bolani, it was well-received by film critics. Smoking Roughly 1/3 of Uruguayan adults smoke tobacco, according to Uruguayan research groups. On March 1, 2006, a law went into effect banning smoking in all enclosed public spaces in Uruguay, including restaurants and bars, among the toughest smoking bans worldwide and the strictest in Latin America. The penalty for businesses that allow smoking is a fine of roughly US $1,100 or a three-day closure. One opinion poll found that 70% of smokers supported the ban. Current President of Uruguay, Tabar√© V√°zquez, is a medic doctor specializing in cancer treatment. Literature Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥ One of Uruguay's most famous works of literature is Ariel by Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥ (1871‚Äì1917). Written in 1900, the book deals with the need to maintain spiritual values while pursuing material and technical progress. Florencio S√°nchez (1875‚Äì1910) wrote plays about social problems that are still performed today. Juan Zorrilla de San Mart√≠n (1855‚Äì1931) wrote epic poems about Uruguayan history (notably Tabar√©). Juana de Ibarbourou (1895‚Äì1979) and Delmira Agustini (1866‚Äì1914) were also notable poets. The Generaci√≥n del 45 (Generation of '45) were of group of writers, mainly from Uruguay, who were famously known to have an influence on literature and culture of the region. Well-known writers belonged to this group such as Mario Benedetti, Amanda Berenguer, Juan Carlos Onetti, Mauricio M√ºller, Humberto Megget, Armon√≠a Somers, Idea Vilari√±o, Emir Rodr√≠guez Monegal, Carlos Maggi, Zenobia Camprub√≠ and among others. Religion Uruguay is South America's most secular country, meaning the importance of religion doesn't really apply to the majority of citizens. It has no official religion and church and state are separate. Religious freedom is guaranteed. The largest religion in Uruguay are the Roman Catholics, making about 66% of the population. Most Uruguayans baptize their children and marry in churches, but don't attend church that often. There is an estimated amount of 20,000 Jews in Uruguay, making it one of the most largest Jewish communities in South America and in the world. Most Jews in Uruguay are Sephardi Jews, followed by Ashkenazim, Mizrahim, and Italkim. During European migration to South America, many German Jews and Italian Jews migrated to Uruguay. There are also several Evangelical Protestant groups, making 2% of the Uruguayan population. Macumba and Umbanda, religions of Afro-Brazilian origin, are currently the fastest-growing religions in Uruguay. There are a few Christian missionary organizations in Uruguay, such as Serve the City (Run by Matthew Daniels). There is also a number of Jehovah's Witnesses, with 11,825 publishers and 156 congregations located within the country. Cuisine The invigorating yerba mate in its gourd with thermos. It is a fixture in Uruguayan daily life. Uruguayans rival only neighboring Argentina in their consumption of beef, primarily at gatherings known in the continent as the asado. The parrillada (beef platter), chivito (a substantial steak sandwich), and pasta are the national dishes. The latter is due to Uruguay's many Italian immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Other Uruguayan dishes include morcilla dulce (a type of blood sausage cooked with ground orange fruit, orange peel, and walnuts) and milanesa (a veal breaded cutlet similar to the German Wienerschnitzel). Snacks include ol√≠mpicos (club sandwiches), h√∫ngaras (spicy sausage in a hot dog roll), and masas surtidas (bite-sized pastries). Typical drinks include mate, tea, cleric√≥ (a mixture of white wine and fruit juice), and medio y medio (part sparkling wine and part white wine). Wine Plantings of Tannat (also known in Uruguay as Harriague) have been increasing in Uruguay each year as that country's wine industry develops, and the country is considered the second most notable Tannat region after Madiran, France. The Tannat wines produced here are characterized by more elegant and softer tannins and blackberry fruit notes. Vineyards in Uruguay have begun to distinguish between the \\"old vines\\" that are descendants from the original cuttings brought over from Europe and the new clones being produced today. The newer vines tend to produce more powerful wines with a higher alcohol level, but less acidity and complex fruit characteristics. Some wineries utilize both vines to make blends.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 241 Harcourt Books 2001 Now the wines typically spend about 20 months in oak prior to release.J.

Sports The Uruguayan National Football Team winning the 2011 edition of the Copa America, hosted by Argentina Sports in Uruguay have been a key element to the culture since the nation's independence. Football (Spanish: f√∫tbol) is the most popular sport in Uruguay. Uruguay has won an Olympic gold medal in 1924, and another one in 1928, which were considered the most important tournaments in football, before the FIFA World Cup began in 1930, hence the four stars on the Uruguayan jersey. The first World Cup, which Uruguay won,World Soccer was held in 1930 in Montevideo. The Estadio Centenario was built for the World Cup, and serves to this day as the country's main football stadium. Uruguay also won the World Cup in 1950, beating Brazil in Rio de Janeiro at the Est√°dio do Maracan√£. The event has had astounding impacts on the history of the sport, due to Brazil being a heavily favoured team at that time, and is also known as the Maracanazo. Uruguay has the most Copa Am√©rica titles, the most important football tournament in the South American region. Uruguay currently has 15 titles to their name, the most recent being the 2011 Copa Am√©rica hosted by Argentina. Uruguay has two major clubs, Pe√±arol and Club Nacional de Football, which both have won major tournaments both nationally and internationally. Pe√±arol has won the Uruguayan Primera Divisi√≥n a total of 49 times, while Nacional have won the division 46 times. Pe√±arol has won the Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious club tournament in South America, 5 times and Nacional have won 3 times. Both teams have won the Intercontinental Cup a total of 3 times (which is the present day FIFA Club World Cup). In September 2009, Pe√±arol was chosen as the South American Club of the Century by the IFFHS. Uruguayans are internationally known in the football world and have produced some of the biggest names of the sport. Some names include: *Enzo Francescoli *Juan Alberto Schiaffino *Hector Scarone *Diego Forl√°n *Luis Su√°rez *√Ålvaro Recoba *Jose Nasazzi *Diego God√≠n *Edinson Cavani *Diego Lugano *Alcides Ghiggia *Antonio Pacheco D'Agosti *Ladislao Mazurkiewicz *Paolo Montero Other popular sports in Uruguay include athletics, auto racing, basketball, boxing, cycling, field hockey, fishing, golf, handball, mountaineering, padel tennis, polo, roller hockey, rowing, rugby union, sailing, skiing, swimming, tennis and volleyball.

Early life and education He studied mathematics at Harvard College (A.B., 1962) and theoretical physics at the University of California at Berkeley (Ph.D., 1966), where his graduate advisor was Geoffrey Chew. For several years he was one of the very few physicists who pursued string theory as a viable theory of quantum gravity. His work with Michael Green on anomaly cancellation in Type I string theories led to the so-called \\"first superstring revolution\\" of 1984, which greatly contributed to moving string theory into the mainstream of research in theoretical physics. Schwarz was an assistant professor at Princeton University from 1966 to 1972. He then moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he is currently the Harold Brown Professor of Theoretical Physics.Faculty website Awards He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Physical Society (1986). He was a fellow of the MacArthur Foundation in 1987.

Hasselbeck first rose to prominence in 2001 as a contestant on the second season of the American version of Survivor, where she finished in fourth place. She married NFL quarterback Tim Hasselbeck the following year. From 2003 to 2013, Hasselbeck appeared as a co-host on the ABC daytime talk show The View, where she became known for her conservative views on sociopolitical issues. With her co-hosts Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Sherri Shepherd, and Barbara Walters, she was awarded the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host during the 36th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2009. Thereafter, Hasselbeck was a co-host on Fox & Friends from 2013 to 2015, and has since retired from television. Early life and education Elisabeth was born on May 28, 1977, in Cranston, Rhode Island. She is the daughter of Catholic school teacher and lawyer Elizabeth DelPadre and architect Kenneth Filarski. Her brother, Kenneth, Jr., is a practicing attorney. Their father is of Polish descent and their mother is of Italian ancestry. Hasselbeck was raised Roman Catholic and attended St. Mary School in Cranston, followed by St. Mary Academy ‚Äì Bay View in East Providence, where she graduated in 1995. She then attended Boston College, where she captained the women's softball team for two seasons, winning consecutive Big East championships. With a concentration on large scale paintings and industrial design, Hasselbeck graduated with a BFA in 1999. Hasselbeck started working for Puma in 1998, while attending Boston College. After graduation, she worked for Puma shoes as a member of its design team before her television career. Television career 2001‚Äì02: Survivor: The Australian Outback In 2001, Hasselbeck (then Elisabeth Filarski) was cast in Survivor: The Australian Outback, and was originally a member of the Kucha tribe. She avoided being voted out at the first Tribal Council which her tribe attended. She then went on a winning streak but lost once again in episode five, where they voted out Kimmi. In episode six, Hasselbeck's tribemate Michael Skupin fell into the campfire and had to be medically evacuated, therefore sending the Kucha and Ogakor tribes into the merge with five members each. When the merge came, she lasted almost nine hours in the first individual immunity challenge in which contestants had to stand on a perch in the water for as long as possible. When the first vote came, her tribemate Jeff was voted out due to previous votes cast against him. This led to another Kucha member Alicia being voted out and sent to the jury. Filarski was next on the block when the biggest threat in her original tribe, Nick, won immunity, but she swayed the votes of Ogakor members Tina Wesson and Colby Donaldson her way, and had Jerri Manthey voted out. At the final five, her closest ally throughout the entire game, Rodger Bingham, was voted out. She then became the sole remaining Kucha member and was voted out, coming in fourth overall. She was one of four votes for Tina to win. She was one of two people who were asked to return for Survivor: All Stars and declined, the other being Colleen Haskell of Survivor: Borneo. Hasselbeck was a judge at the Miss Teen USA 2001 pageant. From 2002 to 2003, she hosted the Style Network's The Look for Less where she helped find stylish clothes for bargain prices. 2003‚Äì13: The View Elizabeth Hasselbeck (second from left), Sherri Shepherd and Whoopi Goldberg pose for a photograph with U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Michelle Howard during Fleet Week, New York 2010. Although Hasselbeck previously saw herself as a \\"behind the scenes\\" kind of person and not interested in a career in television, or playing pundit, her agent was eager to showcase her competitive client and she auditioned for The View in 2003.Maureen Callahan notes in her July 24, 2007 New York Post article The Survivor, according to executive producer Bill Geddie Hasselbeck was one of a number of women who guest-hosted to replace outgoing The View co-host Lisa Ling, who left the show at the end of 2002. She became a permanent co- host on November 24, 2003. Hasselbeck typically represented the conservative position on The View. On August 2, 2006, Hasselbeck got into a heated debate in which she strongly opposed the Food and Drug Administration's plan to sell the \\"morning-after pill\\" as an over-the-counter drug. Hasselbeck stated, \\"I believe that life begins at the moment of conception.\\" She said the over-the- counter distribution of the pill should be banned even in cases of rape and incest, because \\"life still has value.\\" Hasselbeck argued that advocates of the drug use the \\"rape or incest\\" exception as a \\"bait-and-switch\\" distraction from the goal of making it universally accessible. She argued that if the \\"rape or incest\\" exception were all advocates cared about, they would not support its over-the-counter status. On air, moderator Barbara Walters advised Hasselbeck to calm down after she became emotional about the topic. When the live show went to a commercial break, Hasselbeck ripped up her cue cards and stormed off the set. In an expletive-laden off-air conversation picked up on a live mic, Hasselbeck explained to co-host Joy Behar that she did not appreciate being reprimanded on live TV by Walters for being passionate about the topic. She threatened to quit, but producer Bill Geddie convinced her to come back to the set. As the show came back from the break, Walters and Elizabeth appeared together on a couch, awkwardly making up for the situation. Hasselbeck hugged Walters, sat on her lap, and ended up backing off from her threat to quit. On May 23, 2007, Hasselbeck was involved in a heated on-air argument with co-host Rosie O'Donnell concerning the war in Iraq, which she supported and O'Donnell opposed. When O'Donnell asked, \\"655,000 Iraqi civilians dead. Who are the terrorists?\\" O'Donnell was criticized by conservative commentators (including Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly) for her question and she (O'Donnell) complained about Hasselbeck's unwillingness to defend O'Donnell's statements in the controversy that followed. Hasselbeck responded \\"defend your own insinuations,\\" adding that she should not have to defend anyone else's words for them, especially when that person has a forum in which to present a defense. The View's panel (L‚ÄìR: Whoopi Goldberg, Barbara Walters, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd, and Hasselbeck) interview United States President Barack Obama on July 29, 2010 In August 2009, Hasselbeck, along with her co-hosts Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd, and Barbara Walters, won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host. It follows over a decade of nominations for The View with no win. None of the co-hosts of the show was in Los Angeles to collect the award. For the first time, the show had not been nominated for both Outstanding Talk Show and Outstanding Talk Show Host. On March 8, 2013, there were widespread media reports that Hasselbeck was going to be fired from the show, effective at the end of the season, allegedly because of market research polling that showed viewers thought her views were too conservative. However, on the March 11, 2013, episode of the show, Walters said that the rumors were \\"particularly false\\" and that there are \\"no plans for Elisabeth to leave this show\\".Full statement by Barbara Walters on the March 11, 2013, episode of The View: \\"There is a particularly false story that keeps getting picked up about Elisabeth's alleged departure, saying that we don't approve of her conservative views. The truth is, we love Elisabeth. I like her personally and she's just a wonderful person. But beyond that, we value and appreciate her point of view. It's important to us because Elisabeth helps give this show perspective and balance. And believe me, she's tougher than she looks; she'd have to sit here for a decade and take the kind of guff we give her. So we have no plans for Elisabeth to leave this show.\\" On July 9, 2013, ABC confirmed that Hasselbeck would be leaving The View to join Fox & Friends. Her last day on The View was July 10, 2013. 2013‚Äì15: Fox & Friends On September 16, 2013, Hasselbeck joined the Fox News morning show, Fox & Friends as a co-host, replacing Gretchen Carlson. By that November, the show's ratings had grown by 9 percent, and increased 10 percent in viewership among people ages 25‚Äì54.Battaglio, Stephen (November 25, 2013). \\"Hosts With the Most?\\".

CNN. November 24, 2015. Her final day in Fox News was on December 22, 2015. Personal life On July 6, 2002, Hasselbeck married her college boyfriend, professional football quarterback Tim Hasselbeck. They have a daughter, Grace Elisabeth (born in 2005), and two sons, Taylor Thomas (born in 2007), and Isaiah Timothy (born in 2009). Hasselbeck is a Christian, and in August 2014, she condemned the persecution of Christians in Iraq, as well as the removal of Bibles from hotel rooms in the United States. Despite her parents being liberals, Hasselbeck is a Republican. She was a keynote speaker at the Republican National Conventions in both 2004 and 2008. On October 26, 2008, Hasselbeck appeared at Republican rallies in Florida, introducing vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. In August 2013, conservative Newsmax magazine named Hasselbeck among the \\"25 most influential women in the GOP\\". Hasselbeck is a supporter of breast cancer awareness initiatives in the form of an Internet- only PSA on breast cancer diagnosis. Celiac disease Hasselbeck stated she is living with celiac disease. She has written a book on the subject, The G-Free Diet: A Gluten-Free Survival Guide, which has appeared on several best- seller lists. On June 23, 2009, a lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Massachusetts alleging that her book was plagiarized from a self-published book by Susan Hasset. Hasselbeck released a statement calling the allegations baseless. The lawsuit was dismissed in November 2009 when the plaintiff's lawyer declined to pursue it, saying to the press that he believed some degree of plagiarism occurred, but it was not sufficient to justify monetary damages. In 2011, Hasselbeck introduced NoGii, her line of gluten-free nutritional products for children and adults.

History BOCES owes its origin to a state legislative enactment authorizing the formation of intermediate school districts. Passed in 1948, the act was aimed at enabling small rural school districts to combine their resources to provide services that otherwise would have been uneconomical, inefficient, or unavailable. BOCES was to be the temporary means by which careful transitions could be made to an intermediate district framework. Though its purposes were similar to those of the proposed intermediate districts, BOCES was conceived and written into the Education Law in its own separate sections (1950 and 1951). Simpler in structure and less autonomous than projected intermediate districts, the BOCES proved itself worthy of being both means and end. Not one intermediate district was ever formed, and cooperative boards proliferated rapidly, especially during the mid-1950s, reaching 82 by 1958. In 1972 the Intermediate School District Act was repealed. Laws pertaining to BOCES, however, have remained on the books. Thus BOCES has developed from a special-purpose, interim agency into a formally recognized middle or intermediate unit in New York State's public education system. There are currently 37 BOCES incorporating all but 9 of the 697 school districts in New York State. Moreover, other states have moved toward regional educational configurations like BOCES. At least 30 state legislatures have mandated or passed legislation, as educational service agencies study the idea. Membership The total area under supervision of a district superintendent is called a supervisory district. BOCES membership is not available to the so-called Big Five city school districts: New York City, Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers, and Syracuse. Once a district has joined a BOCES, it cannot withdraw and is obligated to pay its annual share of administrative, rental, or facilities expenses. BOCES services are, however, optional. They may be purchased or not purchased as the district's Board of Education (BOE) sees fit. The decision to purchase or not purchase BOCES services is made each school year by district BOEs. How BOCES works BOCES services are created when two or more school districts decide they have similar needs that can be met by a shared program. BOCES helps school districts save money by providing opportunities to pool resources and share costs. Sharing is an economical way for districts to provide programs and services that they might not be able to afford otherwise. It is often more efficient and less costly to operate one central service than it is to have separate programs in each school district. BOCES services are often customized offering districts the flexibility to meet their individual needs. BOCES is governed just as local districts are governed by a Board of Education, which is made up of representatives from component districts. Board members are responsible for curricular, financial, and other policy decisions, just as they are at the local level. Members are elected by component school board members. BOCES board members do not need to be local school board members, but they must be eligible voters in component school districts of that BOCES. Election to BOCES boards occurs at an annual BOCES meeting, which by law is held in April. The duties and powers of BOCES boards, as specified in 1950 of the Education Law of the State of New York, include the following: * Appointment of a district superintendent, subject to approval of the Commissioner of Education; * Provision of cooperative educational services‚Äîwith the commissioner's approval and on a contract basis‚Äîto component school districts; * Needs assessment and long-range planning for cooperative educational services in the supervisory district; * Employment of teachers and other support personnel to carry out BOCES programs; * Preparation of an adjustable budget for the supervisory district program and its administration; * Administration of payments for and costs of provided educational services; * Borrowing of money in anticipation of revenue due; * Entering into contracts with a variety of public agencies as well as non-public schools in order to arrange or provide services under specified conditions; * Renting, purchasing, or selling of property or facilities under specified conditions; * Making reports to the commissioner of education as required. The District Superintendent A BOCES board appoints its own chief executive officer, contingent upon approval of the commissioner of education. As a BOCES executive, the district superintendent serves local districts and is responsible to the board of education representing the component districts of the BOCES. The district superintendent also serves as a representative of the commissioner of education, providing educational leadership to local school districts in matter of law, policy, and practice. Based on these responsibilities, the district superintendent has at least three important roles: * Educational change agent * Regional planner and coordinator * Field representative for the New York State Education Department, a consultative capacity designed to improve two-way communication between state and local levels Services Structure and procedures for providing services The facilities, professional personnel, and services of a BOCES are available to every local school district within the district superintendent's supervisory district. Because the BOCES board must develop its offerings to fulfill local demands and needs, levels of accountability and flexibility are maintained. Under New York State Education Law, a BOCES must furnish any educational service that is requested by two or more component districts and approved by the commissioner of education according to need and practicality in a regional context. By January of each year, the Boards of Education in component school districts specify their potential service needs for the following school year. These needs, developed by the BOCES into annual operating plans, are submitted to the New York State Education Department and the commissioner of education for approval. BOCES boards then notify component districts of the approved services, asking for a firm commitment to participate by May 1 of each year. The BOCES and the component districts then enter into formal contracts. Specified in each contract are the number and types of services to be furnished by the BOCES, the number of people to be served, and the amount to be paid to the BOCES. Signed by the BOCES and component board presidents, and then approved by the commissioner, these contracts are effective for one year, after which they may be renewed, changed, or canceled at the component districts' option. Because districts' needs change every year, decisions about BOCES services may also change every year. If the district doesn't need a BOCES service, it doesn't request it and it doesn't pay for it. Districts may also authorize multi-year service requests from BOCES. Reasons for participation Because BOCES services are shared by two or more school districts, they often cost much less than if districts provided the services on their own. Districts pool their resources, and share the savings. In addition, New York State gives a financial incentive to participate in shared services by offering school districts state aid for BOCES services. Here is how BOCES state aid works: :* Each district's Board of Education selects BOCES services for the current year. :* The following school year, a portion of the cost of BOCES services is returned to the district as BOCES aid. :* The amount returned is based on a formula that takes into account the districts' financial resources. :* Money not spent in a CoSer service is returned to the district at the end of each fiscal year by the BOCES. Funding A BOCES has no taxing authority. Instead, the sources of BOCES funds are primarily taxes levied by its component districts, state aid, and a relatively small amount of federal aid. These funds support an administrative budget (covering administrative salaries, equipment, and services) and a program budget (covering other BOCES programs and services which districts select from the Service Directory, an annual listing of available services). In addition, BOCES may receive and manage funding from outside sources (e.g., state and federal) to cover special projects. The component district's share of BOCES administrative, lease and capital costs is based either on the Resident Weighted Average Daily Attendance (RWADA) or on real property valuation. Program costs are proportional to the amount of use each component district requires. Through BOCES state aid, component districts receive financial support for their participation in BOCES. The cost charged to a component district for its BOCES participation serves as the basis for the district's BOCES state aid. Programs The programs and services offered by each BOCES may vary somewhat, and are developed based upon the needs of a given BOCES' local school districts. A large percentage of BOCES programs and services are instructional; that is to say, they serve students with classroom programs and services. Examples of instructional programs are vocational- technical programs for high school students, physical, speech and occupational therapy for students with disabilities, and literacy programs for adults. Often support staff are broken into on-site, related, or itinerant staff positions. Related personnel often support the program and are housed at the on-site location while Itinerant staff provide services to component districts on an individual or case-by-case basis. The remaining programs are called support services. Although they are not classroom programs, support services are still very important because they relate to the education of students, and because they help school districts save money. This frees up resources to better serve students directly. Examples of support services are staff development, central bus maintenance, central business offices, and Regional Information Centers. An example of programs that BOCES might offer are Academics Support, Auto Body Repair, Auto Technology, Aviation, Aviation Mechanical Technician, Building Maintenance, Business Computer Technology, Carpentry, Computer Repair and Networking, Cosmetology, Criminal Justice, Culinary Arts, Early Childhood Education, Electrical Wiring Technology, Forestry & Conservation, Gas/Diesel Mechanics, Life Skills, Medical Careers, New Vision Health, Nursing Assistant, Practical Nursing, Small Animal Care, Welding and Visual Communications.

When the campaign had begun, baronial enemies of the unpopular John, King of England had flocked to the French banner, but after John's death in 1216, and his replacement by a regent, William Marshal, on behalf of the boy king Henry III, many had moved to the English side.

Oxford University Press, 2009 Information on the treaties is based on three early documents but none of these is known to have been based on an original manuscript. It is known that negotiations were spread over several locations, opening on 6 September 1217 at Staines, because the royal court was nearby at Chertsey or possibly on 5 September on an island of the Thames near Kingston. Various dates for treaties are given by the sources including: * a treaty signed by Louis and Henry's regents on 11 September at Lambeth Palace (the Archbishop of Canterbury's London house), * a Treaty of Kingston on 12 September, * Papal ratification from the Papal legate, who was encamped near Kingston on the 13 September and who issued his terms on 22 September at Merton. * a Treaty of Lambeth signed on 20 September ratifying the Kingston treaty. Whatever documents were actually signed during September, Louis left England for the last time from Dover on 28 September. The principal provisions of the treaties were an amnesty for English rebels. It was also acknowledged that the French had failed to take possession of the entire Channel Islands and so possession of the individual islands was restored to the King of England. Prince Louis undertook not to attack England again and agreed he had never been the legitimate king of England, in exchange for 10,000 marks. Scottish troops under Alexander II also withdrew. There is no known surviving copy of the treaties.Powicke References Bibliography *James H.

The girl celebrating her 15th birthday is a (; feminine form of \\"15-year-old\\"). In Spanish, and in Latin countries, the term is reserved solely for the honoree; in English, primarily in the United States, the term is used to refer to the celebrations and honors surrounding the occasion. This birthday is celebrated differently from any other as it marks the transition from childhood to young womanhood.U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Historically, in the years prior to their 15th birthdays, girls were taught cooking, weaving, and about childbearing by the elder women in their communities in preparation for their future roles as wives and during the celebration the girl's father would present her to potential suitors. In the past, parallel customs could be found in the Iberian Peninsula and France. Today, the custom remains strongest in Mexico, its likely country of introduction. However, it is widely celebrated in Spanish speaking countries in the Americas. The grandest parties are comparable to British and US debutante balls. The celebrations themselves vary significantly in different countries; for example, the festivities in some have taken on more religious overtones than in others. Nowadays, the is also celebrated by many Latino Americans in the United States, each according to their traditions. In Brazil, a Portuguese-speaking country, a similar celebration is called , or . In the French Caribbean and French Guiana, it is called .  Origin  In Mexico contemporary festivities combine Spanish-Catholic traditions with those of Aztec and other indigenous heritages and add in a few modern twists. In ancient Mexico, the Aztecs and other indigenous peoples had many different ceremonies to mark the passage through the various stages of life. The marked a young woman's transition to adulthood, as she was presented, as a virgin, to the community for probable suitors. In a traditional Mexican , young women and men have roles as formal and , who perform special bends at the celebration, along with the herself. There is also a \\"man of honor\\" who accompanies the young woman. Potential suitors present gifts to her family to make up a dowry or bridal wealth.

The meaning behind the has become more refined over time and has been adapted by various Latino cultures in relation to where they are living.

In the 20th century, the received certain privileges associated with womanhood: permission to attend adult parties, pluck her eyebrows and shave her legs, wear makeup, jewelry and high heels. When this tradition originated, the was a small party to celebrate the transition. Friends and family gathered in order to give the girl a chance to mingle with young men. Rich families celebrated with big parties and elaborate dresses. In Latin American countries, wealthy families announced in the newspapers to publicize their extravagant celebrations. In the 1960s, as more Latinos migrated to the United States, they brought their differing national traditions with them. Once in the United States, formerly poor immigrants with good jobs were able to have big parties like the ones back in their home country. The average cost of a around that time was US$400. In 2015, the cost of a modest, traditional was estimated as approximately US$500‚Äì600. Family and friends often help put on the event, for example, by making food. An elaborate and extravagant could cost up to US$12,000+. From a simple food and cake celebration, it has developed among wealthier families to become an occasion for a big party. Families may use event planners, and develop a celebration with a theme, to be staged with a special entrance and dances, and captured by professional photoshoots and video. Modern celebrations also incorporate traditions from other cultures. A market for event planners and -related products has developed.

The location, if indoors, commonly has its entrance specially adorned for the occasion. The father and daughter make their entry through this front-door entrance while music plays, and friends and relatives customarily give flowers (usually roses) to the father. After this, the ceremony of the waltz begins, in which the girl first dances with her father‚Äîor the father figure‚Äîwho passes her on to her friends and relatives.

At this religious mass, a Rosary, or sometimes a necklace with a locket or pendant depicting Mexico's patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe, is presented to the teenager by her godparents, the necklace having been previously blessed by the priest. She is also awarded a tiara, which serves as a reminder that to her loved ones, especially her immediate family, the will always be a princess. Some also see it as denoting that she is a \\"princess\\" before God and the world. After this, the girl may leave her bouquet of flowers on the altar for the Virgin Mary.

Spain  are growing in popularity in Spain, which sees frequent emigration from the countries of the former Spanish Empire. The demand has grown so much that Spanish event companies now specialize in organizing parties for Latin American communities across Spain, where events typically cost thousands of euros and guests number in the hundreds.

The concept has not caught on among non- immigrant Spanish, although one company in Madrid that specializes in organized one for a girl from a Spanish family.

It is twinned with Seclin in northern France. Larkhall sits on high ground between the River Clyde to the East and the Avon Water to the West. Larkhall sits on the edge of the scenic Clyde valley and is a commuter town for Glasgow. Larkhall had a population of 14,951 in the 2011 UK Census, and is a typical Scottish former industrial town. Traditionally a mining, weaving and textile area, most of Larkhall's traditional industries have now closed down, including the Lanarkshire ironworks. Toponym The name Larkhall or Laverock Ha first appears in journals around 1620. The origins of the name are unknown, although Laverock is the Scots word for skylark. However, there is no evidence that the town is named after the bird. It is more likely that Laverock was a surname.A. D. MILLS. \\"Larkhall.\\" A Dictionary of British Place-Names. Oxford University Press. 2003. The name for Larkhall was originally a Scots word Laverockhaugh (Laverockha), which meant laverock - skylark and haugh - boggy/wet area. Education The primary schools in Larkhall are Machanhill Primary School, Dalserf Primary School, Glengowan Primary School, Hareleeshill Primary School, Craigbank Primary School, Netherburn Primary School and Robert Smillie Memorial Primary School. There is also a Catholic primary school, St Mary's. The town's sole secondary school is Larkhall Academy. Religion The Church of Scotland has most adherents at 7416 persons (49.6% of the population). The 2011 census notes there are 1247 Roman Catholics living in the town (8.3% of the population). Larkhall contains eight churches: Chalmers Parish Church, The Church At The Cross, Larkhall Baptist Church, Larkhall Congregational Church, St. Machan's Parish Church, St. Mary's R.C. Church, Strutherhill Gospel Hall and Trinity Parish Church. There is also a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses. Transport Trains returned to the town in December 2005, with the opening of the new Larkhall railway station, which is a terminus on the Argyle Line. The station provides regular services to Glasgow and beyond. Merryton railway station serves the northern end of town and is also on the Argyle Line. Larkhall also has good bus links with frequent services to Hamilton, Lanark, Motherwell, Stonehouse, Strathaven and Wishaw. Scotland's main motorway, the M74 skirts the eastern edges of the town. Larkhall has 2 motorway intersections: Junction 7 with the A72, which is for southbound traffic only, and Junction 8 with the A71, which is for both northbound and southbound traffic. Junction 8 is known locally as Canderside Toll or The Toll. The centre of Glasgow can be reached in 20 minutes; Edinburgh is around 50 minutes away. Location grid Sport Because of the Protestant majority, residents mainly support Rangers F.C., to the point where it was noted in 2008 that the colour green ‚Äî which is associated with that team's Catholic rivals Celtic F.C. ‚Äî is avoided by retailers. However, community leaders attributed any trouble to a small number of vandals. A local authority study in 2017 found that sectarianism was not a major issue in the town. The town has two Junior Football teams: Larkhall Thistle F.C. and Royal Albert F.C. although Royal Albert now play in Stonehouse, a neighbouring village while Larkhall Thistle play at Gasworks Park on Raploch Street. Royal Albert were once a full member of the Scottish Football League but now ply their trade in the lower reaches of the Central Junior divisions. Also present in the town are Larkhall United Junior Football Club. Larkhall is also home to the West Of Scotland Karting club just outside town. The club being started by local men James Smith and David Byars, with the track itself constructed by Alex Duncan and John Lindsay. The town also has its own 9 hole municipal Golf Course which was founded in 1909. It also has a running club, Larkhall YMCA Harriers, whose vests are red with two white hoops. The Harriers consist of Master ladies and men, Senior Ladies and men, Under 17s, Under 15s, Under 13s, Under 11s and Under 9s. Black Lady The black lady of Larkhall was the Indian servant of Captain Henry McNeil Hamilton, the last owner of Broomhill House (). She was brought to Larkhall by Captain McNeil after one of his many seafaring voyages. She was happy with her new life but her ignorance of Scottish customs made her a social outcast. The Captain forbade her to leave Broomhill House during the day. Soon she was not seen at night either and the Captain claimed she had disappeared, but locals were suspicious. She is said to have returned, as her ghostly form appeared in the windows of Broomhill House and then later in Morgan Glen. The Captain is said to have died prematurely. When Broomhill House fell into disrepair the door lintel was moved down to The Applebank Public House on Millheugh road by a large group of men. The next day it was found lying across the road from the public house. In the 1960s a team from the Tonight programme visited Larkhall as they tried to perform the first televised exorcism. The cameras were frozen over in fine weather and after filming finished the director was killed in a road crash on his way to another location. He was found with a fence post impaled in his heart.Black Lady . Larkhall Academy. Local landmarks One of the town's most notable landmarks is the Morgan Glen viaduct standing over the Avon Water. It spans some , and at a height of , it is the tallest viaduct in Scotland. This has now fallen into disrepair since the closure of the railway line in 1965 and has thus been closed to public access for safety reasons. Notable people Larkhall is home to snooker player and 2006 World Snooker Championship winner, Graeme Dott. Previous residents Paul McStay, more successful footballer's like Tommy McLean and his brother Jim McLeancome from a village called Ashgill next to Larkhall . Other high-profile former residents include actress Una McLean and BBC Radio Scotland Editor Colin Paterson.

He batted and threw right-handed. Salazar, who was known by the nickname \\"Angel\\", was signed by Montreal as an amateur free agent in 1980. He made his debut in the 1983 season. Following a long string of shortstops coming from Venezuela, Salazar had below average range but compensated somewhat with a strong and accurate arm. He struggled with the bat, most of time near the Mendoza Line. In 1984, Salazar had arguably the worst season in MLB history by a regular starter. In 80 games, he had a batting average of .155 and an adjusted OPS of 9 (League average being 100). He wasn't much better on the base-paths, having one stolen base and one caught stealing (matching his career stolen base percentage of 50%). And while Salazar had a reputation as a good fielding shortstop, in reality both his range factor and fielding percentage were well below the league average of shortstops in 1984.

History Pigface was formed from Ministry's The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste tour, which produced the In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up live album and video. For the tour, Al Jourgensen brought Atkins, Nivek Ogre and Chris Connelly. Also on the tour was Rieflin, regular Ministry drummer at the time. While Atkins enjoyed the dynamic of playing with a second drummer, he felt that the lineup was capable of doing much more than being, what he has frequently called, \\"a Ministry cover band.\\" Once the tour was over, Atkins and Rieflin decided to continue working together and recruited several of their tourmates. Pigface was born with the intention of keeping a revolving-door style collaboration with many experimentally-minded musicians, many of whom, especially early on, had recorded for the influential industrial music record label Wax Trax!. Trent Reznor was also an early partner, before Nine Inch Nails became a household name. \\"Suck,\\" co-written and sung by Reznor, was something of an underground hit, and Reznor later re-recorded the song for the Broken EP. Rieflin left Pigface after the first tour, leaving Atkins as the sole founder of the group. With hundreds of musical collaborators to record and perform with Pigface, it has ensured that each album, tour, and song is unique. However, this practice has led to some negative criticism due to a perceived lack of continuity. In 2009, Full Effect Records, a Detroit-based label, announced the signing of Pigface. The Pigface album, 6, a collection of songs already recorded over the span of the previous five years, was released soon after the announcement was made. Unlike with the previous releases, there was no tour to support the album. After a seven-year hiatus, Pigface returned for two Chicago performances in November 2016. The first was a rehearsal show held at Reggie's on November 24. On November 25, the band performed at House of Blues: Chicago. Both shows saw the band performing with several first-time members as well as the return of members like Lesley Rankine, En Esch, Mary Byker, Curse Mackey, Dirk Flannigan and Fallon Bowman. Several offshoot bands of Pigface, all smaller sized all-star groups featuring Martin Atkins as a common member, have released albums during the time Pigface was active. These bands include Murder, Inc., The Damage Manual, Ritalin, Martin Atkins And The Chicago Industrial League, Spasm, and The Love Interest. In March 2019, Atkins announced that Pigface would tour again for the first time in fourteen years with thirteen dates scheduled for the East coast and Midwest in November 2019. On February 12, 2020, a larger, national tour was announced to be taking place throughout May, June and July of that year. However, on April 2, 2020, Atkins made the announcement that, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour had been canceled. Rieflin died on March 24, 2020 from cancer at the age of 59. Members and collaborators The following is a partial list of musicians who have contributed to Pigface at some point in the band's history, whether it be appearing live as a band member, performing on an album, or contributing a remix of a Pigface song, along with some of the bands and acts they have been associated with before, during, or after their involvement with Pigface. *Martin Atkins (Public Image Ltd, Ministry, Killing Joke, Brian Brain, Murder, Inc., Rx) *William Rieflin (Ministry, Revolting Cocks, KMFDM, R.E.M., King Crimson) *Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails, How to Destroy Angels) *Paul Barker (Ministry, Lead into Gold, Revolting Cocks) *Chris Connelly (Ministry, Murder, Inc., The Damage Manual, Revolting Cocks) *En Esch (KMFDM, Slick Idiot) *Nivek Ogre (Skinny Puppy, ohGr, Rx) *Matthew Schultz (Lab Report, Lard) *William Tucker (Regressive Aid, Ministry, Revolting Cocks, KMFDM) *David Yow (The Jesus Lizard, Scratch Acid) *Steve Albini (Big Black, Rapeman, Shellac) *John Wills (Loop, The Hair and Skin Trading Company) *Danny Carey (Tool, Green Jell√∂) *Pat Sprawl (Skinny Puppy, Dead Surf Kiss, Drown) *Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fear) *Genesis P-Orridge (Psychic TV, Throbbing Gristle) *Dean Ween (Ween, Moistboyz, Dean Ween Group) *Black Francis (Pixies, Frank Black and the Catholics) *Joey Santiago (Pixies, The Martinis) *Michael Gira (Swans, Angels of Light) *J.G.

Unlike traditional cryptographic tasks, where cryptography assures security and integrity of communication or storage and the adversary is outside the system of participants (an eavesdropper on the sender and receiver), the cryptography in this model protects participants' privacy from each other. The foundation for secure multi-party computation started in the late 1970s with the work on mental poker, cryptographic work that simulates game playing/computational tasks over distances without requiring a trusted third party. Note that traditionally, cryptography was about concealing content, while this new type of computation and protocol is about concealing partial information about data while computing with the data from many sources, and correctly producing outputs.  History  Special purpose protocols for specific tasks started in the late 1970s.A. Shamir, R. Rivest, and L. Adleman, \\"Mental Poker\\", Technical Report LCS/TR-125, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, April 1979. Later, secure computation was formally introduced as secure two-party computation (2PC) in 1982 (for the so-called Millionaires' Problem, a specific problem which is a Boolean predicate), and in generality (for any feasible computation) in 1986 by Andrew Yao.Andrew C. Yao, Protocols for secure computations (extended abstract)Andrew Chi-Chih Yao:How to Generate and Exchange Secrets (Extended Abstract). FOCS 1986: 162-167 The area is also referred to as Secure Function Evaluation (SFE). The two party case was followed by a generalization to the multi-party by Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson. The computation is based on secret sharing of all the inputs and zero-knowledge proofs for a potentially malicious case, where the majority of honest players in the malicious adversary case assure that bad behavior is detected and the computation continues with the dishonest person eliminated or his input revealed. This work suggested the very basic general scheme to be followed by essentially all future multi-party protocols for secure computing.Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, Avi Wigderson:How to Play any Mental Game or A Completeness Theorem for Protocols with Honest Majority. STOC 1987: 218-229 This work was followed by the first robust secure protocol which tolerates faulty behavior graciously without revealing anyone's output via a work which invented for this purpose the often used \`share of shares idea'Zvi Galil, Stuart Haber, Moti Yung: Cryptographic Computation: Secure Fault- Tolerant Protocols and the Public-Key Model. CRYPTO 1987: 135-155 and a protocol that allows one of the parties to hide its input unconditionally.David Chaum, Ivan Damg√•rd, Jeroen van de Graaf: Multiparty Computations Ensuring Privacy of Each Party's Input and Correctness of the Result. 87-119 The above results are in a model where the adversary is limited to polynomial time computations, and it observes all communications, and therefore the model is called the \`computational model'. Further, the protocol of oblivious transfer was shown to be complete for these tasks.Joe Kilian: Founding Cryptography on Oblivious Transfer. STOC 1988: 20-31 The above results established that it is possible under the above variations to achieve secure computation when the majority of users are honest. The next question to solve was the case of secure communication channels where the point-to-point communication is not available to the adversary; in this case it was shown that solutions can be achieved with up to 1/3 of the parties being misbehaving and malicious, and the solutions apply no cryptographic tools (since secure communication is available).Michael Ben-Or, Shafi Goldwasser, Avi Wigderson: Completeness Theorems for Non-Cryptographic Fault- Tolerant Distributed Computation (Extended Abstract). STOC 1988: 1-10 Adding a broadcast channel allows the system to tolerate up to 1/2 misbehaving minority,Tal Rabin, Michael Ben-Or: Verifiable Secret Sharing and Multiparty Protocols with Honest Majority (Extended Abstract). STOC 1989: 73-85 whereas connectivity constraints on the communication graph were investigated in the book Perfectly Secure Message Transmission.Danny Dolev, Cynthia Dwork, Orli Waarts, Moti Yung: Perfectly Secure Message Transmission. J. ACM 40(1): 17-47 (1993) Over the years, the notion of general purpose multi-party protocols became a fertile area to investigate basic and general protocol issues properties on, such as universal composability or mobile adversary as in proactive secret sharing.Rafail Ostrovsky, Moti Yung: How to Withstand Mobile Virus Attacks. PODC 1991. pp. 51-59 Since the late 2000s, and certainly since 2010 and on, the domain of general purpose protocols has moved to deal with efficiency improvements of the protocols with practical applications in mind. Increasingly efficient protocols for MPC have been proposed, and MPC can be now considered as a practical solution to various real-life problems (especially ones that only require linear sharing of the secrets and mainly local operations on the shares with not much interactions among the parties), such as distributed voting, private bidding and auctions, sharing of signature or decryption functions and private information retrieval.Claudio Orlandi: Is multiparty computation any good in practice?, ICASSP 2011 The first large- scale and practical application of multi-party computation (demonstrated on an actual auction problem) took place in Denmark in January 2008. Obviously, both theoretical notions and investigations, and applied constructions are needed (e.g., conditions for moving MPC into part of day by day business was advocated and presented inMoti Yung: From Mental Poker to Core Business: Why and How to Deploy Secure Computation Protocols? ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2015: 1-2 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2810103.2812701).  Definition and overview  In an MPC, a given number of participants, p1, p2, ..., pN, each have private data, respectively d1, d2, ..., dN. Participants want to compute the value of a public function on that private data: F(d1, d2, ..., dN) while keeping their own inputs secret. For example, suppose we have three parties Alice, Bob and Charlie, with respective inputs x, y and z denoting their salaries. They want to find out the highest of the three salaries, without revealing to each other how much each of them makes. Mathematically, this translates to them computing: : If there were some trusted outside party (say, they had a mutual friend Tony who they knew could keep a secret), they could each tell their salary to Tony, he could compute the maximum, and tell that number to all of them. The goal of MPC is to design a protocol, where, by exchanging messages only with each other, Alice, Bob, and Charlie can still learn without revealing who makes what and without having to rely on Tony. They should learn no more by engaging in their protocol than they would learn by interacting with an incorruptible, perfectly trustworthy Tony. In particular, all that the parties can learn is what they can learn from the output and their own input. So in the above example, if the output is z, then Charlie learns that his z is the maximum value, whereas Alice and Bob learn (if x, y and z are distinct), that their input is not equal to the maximum, and that the maximum held is equal to z. The basic scenario can be easily generalised to where the parties have several inputs and outputs, and the function outputs different values to different parties. Informally speaking, the most basic properties that a multi-party computation protocol aims to ensure are: * Input privacy: No information about the private data held by the parties can be inferred from the messages sent during the execution of the protocol. The only information that can be inferred about the private data is whatever could be inferred from seeing the output of the function alone. * Correctness: Any proper subset of adversarial colluding parties willing to share information or deviate from the instructions during the protocol execution should not be able to force honest parties to output an incorrect result. This correctness goal comes in two flavours: either the honest parties are guaranteed to compute the correct output (a ‚Äúrobust‚Äù protocol), or they abort if they find an error (an MPC protocol ‚Äúwith abort‚Äù). There are a wide range of practical applications, varying from simple tasks such as coin tossing to more complex ones like electronic auctions (e.g. compute the market clearing price), electronic voting, or privacy-preserving data mining. A classical example is the Millionaires' Problem: two millionaires want to know who is richer, in such a way that neither of them learns the net worth of the other. A solution to this situation is essentially to securely evaluate the comparison function.  Security definitions  A multi-party computation protocol must be secure to be effective. In modern cryptography, the security of a protocol is related to a security proof. The security proof is a mathematical proof where the security of a protocol is reduced to that of the security of its underlying primitives. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to formalize the cryptographic protocol security verification based on the party knowledge and the protocol correctness. For MPC protocols, the environment in which the protocol operates is associated with the Real World/Ideal World Paradigm.Michael Backes, Birgit Pfitzmann, and Michael Waidner. \\"A general composition theorem for secure reactive systems.\\" In Theory of Cryptography Conference, pp. 336-354. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2004. The parties can't be said to learn nothing, since they need to learn the output of the operation, and the output depends on the inputs. In addition, the output correctness is not guaranteed, since the correctness of the output depends on the parties‚Äô inputs, and the inputs have to be assumed to be corrupted. The Real World/Ideal World Paradigm states two worlds: (i) In the ideal-world model, there exists an incorruptible trusted party to whom each protocol participant sends its input. This trusted party computes the function on its own and sends back the appropriate output to each party. (ii) In contrast, in the real-world model, there is no trusted party and all the parties can do is to exchange messages with each other. A protocol is said to be secure if one can learn no more about each party's private inputs in the real world than one could learn in the ideal world. In the ideal world, no messages are exchanged between parties, so real-world exchanged messages cannot reveal any secret information. The Real World/Ideal World Paradigm provides a simple abstraction of the complexities of MPC to allow the construction of an application under the pretense that the MPC protocol at its core is actually an ideal execution. If the application is secure in the ideal case, then it is also secure when a real protocol is run instead. The security requirements on an MPC protocol are stringent. Nonetheless, in 1987 it was demonstrated that any function can be securely computed, with security for malicious adversaries and the other initial works mentioned before. Despite these publications, MPC was not designed to be efficient enough to be used in practice at that time. Unconditionally or information-theoretically secure MPC is closely related and builds on to the problem of secret sharing, and more specifically verifiable secret sharing (VSS), which many secure MPC protocols use against active adversaries. Unlike traditional cryptographic applications, such as encryption or signature, one must assume that the adversary in an MPC protocol is one of the players engaged in the system (or controlling internal parties). That corrupted party or parties may collude in order to breach the security of the protocol. Let n be the number of parties in the protocol and t the number of parties who can be adversarial. The protocols and solutions for the case of t < n/2 (i.e., when an honest majority is assumed) are different from those where no such assumption is made. This latter case includes the important case of two-party computation where one of the participants may be corrupted, and the general case where an unlimited number of participants are corrupted and collude to attack the honest participants. Adversaries faced by the different protocols can be categorized according to how willing they are to deviate from the protocol. There are essentially two types of adversaries, each giving rise to different forms of security (and each fits into different real world scenario): * Semi-Honest (Passive) Security: In this case, it is assumed that corrupted parties merely cooperate to gather information out of the protocol, but do not deviate from the protocol specification. This is a naive adversary model, yielding weak security in real situations. However, protocols achieving this level of security prevent inadvertent leakage of information between (otherwise collaborating) parties, and are thus useful if this is the only concern. In addition, protocols in the semi-honest model are quite efficient, and are often an important first step for achieving higher levels of security. * Malicious (Active) Security: In this case, the adversary may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol execution in its attempt to cheat. Protocols that achieve security in this model provide a very high security guarantee. In the case of majority of misbehaving parties: The only thing that an adversary can do in the case of dishonest majority is to cause the honest parties to ‚Äúabort‚Äù having detected cheating. If the honest parties do obtain output, then they are guaranteed that it is correct. Their privacy is always preserved. Security against active adversaries typically leads to a reduction in efficiency that leads to covert security, a relaxed form of active security. Covert security captures more realistic situations, where active adversaries are willing to cheat but only if they are not caught. For example, their reputation could be damaged, preventing future collaboration with other honest parties. Thus, protocols that are covertly secure provide mechanisms to ensure that, if some of the parties do not follow the instructions, then it will be noticed with high probability, say 75% or 90%. In a way, covert adversaries are active ones forced to act passively due to external non- cryptographic (e.g. business) concerns. This mechanism sets a bridge between both models in the hope of finding protocols which are efficient and secure enough in practice. Like many cryptographic protocols, the security of an MPC protocol can rely on different assumptions: * It can be computational (i.e. based on some mathematical problem, like factoring) or unconditional, namely relying on physical unavailability of messages on channels (usually with some probability of error which can be made arbitrarily small). * The model might assume that participants use a synchronized network, where a message sent at a \\"tick\\" always arrives at the next \\"tick\\", or that a secure and reliable broadcast channel exists, or that a secure communication channel exists between every pair of participants where an adversary cannot read, modify or generate messages in the channel, etc. The set of honest parties that can execute a computational task is related to the concept of access structure. Adversary structures can be static, where the adversary chooses its victims before the start of the multi-party computation, or dynamic, where it chooses its victims during the course of execution of the multi-party computation making the defense harder. An adversary structure can be defined as a threshold structure or as a more complex structure. In a threshold structure the adversary can corrupt or read the memory of a number of participants up to some threshold. Meanwhile, in a complex structure it can affect certain predefined subsets of participants, modeling different possible collusions.  Protocols  There are major differences between the protocols proposed for two party computation (2PC) and multi-party computation (MPC). Also, often for special purpose protocols of importance a specialized protocol that deviates from the generic ones has to be designed (voting, auctions, payments, etc.)  Two-party computation  The two party setting is particularly interesting, not only from an applications perspective but also because special techniques can be applied in the two party setting which do not apply in the multi-party case. Indeed, secure multi-party computation (in fact the restricted case of secure function evaluation, where only a single function is evaluated) was first presented in the two-party setting. The original work is often cited as being from one of the two papers of Yao;Andrew C. Yao, \\"How to generate and exchange secrets,\\" SFCS '86 Proceedings of the 27th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 162-167, 1986. although the papers do not actually contain what is now known as Yao's garbled circuit protocol. Yao's basic protocol is secure against semi-honest adversaries and is extremely efficient in terms of number of rounds, which is constant, and independent of the target function being evaluated. The function is viewed as a Boolean circuit, with inputs in binary of fixed length. A Boolean circuit is a collection of gates connected with three different types of wires: circuit- input wires, circuit-output wires and intermediate wires. Each gate receives two input wires and it has a single output wire which might be fan-out (i.e. be passed to multiple gates at the next level). Plain evaluation of the circuit is done by evaluating each gate in turn; assuming the gates have been topologically ordered. The gate is represented as a truth table such that for each possible pair of bits (those coming from the input wires' gate) the table assigns a unique output bit; which is the value of the output wire of the gate. The results of the evaluation are the bits obtained in the circuit- output wires. Yao explained how to garble a circuit (hide its structure) so that two parties, sender and receiver, can learn the output of the circuit and nothing else. At a high level, the sender prepares the garbled circuit and sends it to the receiver, who obliviously evaluates the circuit, learning the encodings corresponding to both his and the sender's output. He then just sends back the sender's encodings, allowing the sender to compute his part of the output. The sender sends the mapping from the receivers output encodings to bits to the receiver, allowing the receiver to obtain their output. In more detail, the garbled circuit is computed as follows. The main ingredient is a double-keyed symmetric encryption scheme. Given a gate of the circuit, each possible value of its input wires (either 0 or 1) is encoded with a random number (label). The values resulting from the evaluation of the gate at each of the four possible pair of input bits are also replaced with random labels. The garbled truth table of the gate consists of encryptions of each output label using its inputs labels as keys. The position of these four encryptions in the truth table is randomized so no information on the gate is leaked. To correctly evaluate each garbled gate the encryption scheme has the following two properties. Firstly, the ranges of the encryption function under any two distinct keys are disjoint (with overwhelming probability). The second property says that it can be checked efficiently whether a given ciphertext has been encrypted under a given key. With these two properties the receiver, after obtaining the labels for all circuit-input wires, can evaluate each gate by first finding out which of the four ciphertexts has been encrypted with his label keys, and then decrypting to obtain the label of the output wire. This is done obliviously as all the receiver learns during the evaluation are encodings of the bits. The sender's (i.e. circuit creators) input bits can be just sent as encodings to the evaluator; whereas the receiver's (i.e. circuit evaluators) encodings corresponding to his input bits are obtained via a 1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer (OT) protocol. A 1-out-of-2 OT protocol, enables the sender, in possession of two values C1 and C2, to send the one requested by the receiver (b a value in {1,2}) in such a way that the sender does not know what value has been transferred, and the receiver only learns the queried value. If one is considering malicious adversaries, further mechanisms to ensure correct behavior of both parties need to be provided. By construction it is easy to show security for the sender, as all the receiver can do is to evaluate a garbled circuit that would fail to reach the circuit-output wires if he deviated from the instructions. The situation is very different on the sender's side. For example, he may send an incorrect garbled circuit that computes a function revealing the receiver's input. This would mean that privacy no longer holds, but since the circuit is garbled the receiver would not be able to detect this.  Multi-party protocols  Most MPC protocols, as opposed to 2PC protocols and especially under the unconditional setting of private channels, make use of secret sharing. In the secret sharing based methods, the parties do not play special roles (as in Yao, of creator and evaluator). Instead, the data associated with each wire is shared amongst the parties, and a protocol is then used to evaluate each gate. The function is now defined as a ‚Äúcircuit‚Äù over a finite field, as opposed to the binary circuits used for Yao. Such a circuit is called an arithmetic circuit in the literature, and it consists of addition and multiplication ‚Äúgates‚Äù where the values operated on are defined over a finite field. Secret sharing allows one to distribute a secret among a number of parties by distributing shares to each party. Two types of secret sharing schemes are commonly used; Shamir secret sharing and additive secret sharing. In both cases the shares are random elements of a finite field that add up to the secret in the field; intuitively, security is achieved because any non-qualifying set of shares looks randomly distributed. Secret sharing schemes can tolerate an adversary controlling up to t parties out of n total parties, where t varies based on the scheme, the adversary can be passive or active, and different assumptions are made on the power of the adversary. The Shamir secret sharing scheme is secure against a passive adversary when t < \\\\frac{n}{2} and an active adversary when t < \\\\frac{n}{3} while achieving information-theoretic security, meaning that even if the adversary has unbounded computational power, they cannot learn any information about the secret underlying a share. The BGW protocol, which defines how to compute addition and multiplication on secret shares, is often used to compute functions with Shamir secret shares. Additive secret sharing schemes can tolerate the adversary controlling all but one party, that is t < n, while maintaining security against a passive and active adversary with unbounded computational power. Some protocols require a setup phase, which may only be secure against a computationally bounded adversary. A number of systems have implemented various forms of MPC with secret sharing schemes. The most popular is SPDZ,I. Damg√•rd, V. Pastro, N. Smart and S. Zakarias, \\"Multiparty computation from somewhat homomorphic encryption,\\" Crypto 2012, vol. Springer LNCS 7417, pp. 643-662, 2012. which implements MPC with additive secret shares and is secure against active adversaries.  Other protocols  In 2014 a \\"model of fairness in secure computation in which an adversarial party that aborts on receiving output is forced to pay a mutually predefined monetary penalty\\" has been described for the Bitcoin network or for fair lottery.  Practical MPC systems  Many advances have been made on 2PC and MPC systems in recent years.  Yao-based protocols  One of the main issues when working with Yao-based protocols is that the function to be securely evaluated (which could be an arbitrary program) must be represented as a circuit, usually consisting of XOR and AND gates. Since most real-world programs contain loops and complex data structures, this is a highly non-trivial task. The Fairplay systemA. Ben-David, N. Nisan and B. Pinkas, \\"FairplayMP: a system for secure multi-party computation,\\" ACM CCS 2008, pp. 257‚Äì266, 2008. was the first tool designed to tackle this problem. Fairplay comprises two main components. The first of these is a compiler enabling users to write programs in a simple high-level language, and output these programs in a Boolean circuit representation. The second component can then garble the circuit and execute a protocol to securely evaluate the garbled circuit. As well as two-party computation based on Yao's protocol, Fairplay can also carry out multi-party protocols. This is done using the BMR protocol, which extends Yao's passively secure protocol to the active case. In the years following the introduction of Fairplay, many improvements to Yao's basic protocol have been created, in the form of both efficiency improvements and techniques for active security. These include techniques such as the free XOR method, which allows for much simpler evaluation of XOR gates, and garbled row reduction, reducing the size of garbled tables with two inputs by 25%.B. Pinkas, T. Schneider, N. Smart and S. Williams, \\"Secure two-party computation is practical,\\" Asiacrypt 2009, vol. Springer LNCS 5912, pp. 250‚Äì267, 2009. The approach that so far seems to be the most fruitful in obtaining active security comes from a combination of the garbling technique and the ‚Äúcut-and- choose‚Äù paradigm. This combination seems to render more efficient constructions. To avoid the aforementioned problems with respect to dishonest behaviour, many garblings of the same circuit are sent from the constructor to the evaluator. Then around half of them (depending on the specific protocol) are opened to check consistency, and if so a vast majority of the unopened ones are correct with high probability. The output is the majority vote of all the evaluations. Note that here the majority output is needed. If there is disagreement on the outputs the receiver knows the sender is cheating, but he cannot complain as otherwise this would leak information on his input. This approach for active security was initiated by Lindell and Pinkas.Y. Lindell and B. Pinkas, \\"An efficient protocol for secure two-party computation in the presence of malicious adversaries,\\" Eurocrypt 2007, vol. Springer LNCS 4515, pp. 52-78, 2007. This technique was implemented by Pinkas et al. in 2009, This provided the first actively secure two-party evaluation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) circuit, regarded as a highly complex (consisting of around 30,000 AND and XOR gates), non-trivial function (also with some potential applications), taking around 20 minutes to compute and requiring 160 circuits to obtain a 2^{-40} cheating probability. As many circuits are evaluated, the parties (including the receiver) need to commit to their inputs to ensure that in all the iterations the same values are used. The experiments of Pinkas et al. reported show that the bottleneck of the protocol lies in the consistency checks. They had to send over the net about 6,553,600 commitments to various values to evaluate the AES circuit. In recent resultsY. Lindell, \\"Fast cut-and-choose based protocols for malicious and covert adversaries,\\" Crypto 2013, vol. Springer LNCS 8043, pp. 1-17, 2013. the efficiency of actively secure Yao-based implementations was improved even further, requiring only 40 circuits, and much less commitments, to obtain 2^{-40} cheating probability. The improvements come from new methodologies for performing cut- and-choose on the transmitted circuits. More recently, there has been a focus on highly parallel implementations based on garbled circuits, designed to be run on CPUs with many cores. Kreuter, et al.B. Kreuter, a. shalet and C.-H. Shen, \\"Billion gate secure computation with malicious adversaries,\\" USENIX Security Symposium 2012, pp. 285‚Äì300, 2012. describe an implementation running on 512 cores of a powerful cluster computer. Using these resources they could evaluate the 4095-bit edit distance function, whose circuit comprises almost 6 billion gates. To accomplish this they developed a custom, better optimized circuit compiler than Fairplay and several new optimizations such as pipelining, whereby transmission of the garbled circuit across the network begins while the rest of the circuit is still being generated. The time to compute AES was reduced to 1.4 seconds per block in the active case, using a 512-node cluster machine, and 115 seconds using one node. Shelat and ShenA. Shelat and C.-H. Shen, \\"Fast two-party secure computation with minimal assumptions,\\" ACM CCS 2013, pp. 523‚Äì534, 2013. improve this, using commodity hardware, to 0.52 seconds per block. The same paper reports on a throughput of 21 blocks per second, but with a latency of 48 seconds per block. Meanwhile, another group of researchers has investigated using consumer-grade GPUs to achieve similar levels of parallelism.T. Frederiksen and J. Nielsen, \\"Fast and maliciously secure two-party computation using the GPU, \\"ACNS 2013, vol. Springer LNCS 7954, pp. 339‚Äì356, 2013. They utilize OT extensions and some other novel techniques to design their GPU-specific protocol. This approach seems to achieve comparable efficiency to the cluster computing implementation, using a similar number of cores. However, the authors only report on an implementation of the AES circuit, which has around 50,000 gates. On the other hand, the hardware required here is far more accessible, as similar devices may already be found in many people's desktop computers or games consoles. The authors obtain a timing of 2.7 seconds per AES block on a standard desktop, with a standard GPU. If they allow security to decrease to something akin to covert security, they obtain a run time of 0.30 seconds per AES block. In the passive security case there are reports of processing of circuits with 250 million gates, and at a rate of 75 million gates per second.Y. Huang, J. Katz and D. Evans, \\"Efficient secure two-party computation using symmetric cut-and-choose.,\\" CRYPTO, vol. Springer LNCS 8043, pp. 18-35, 2013.

Several of his books have also been featured in Reader's Digest. His books have sold nearly 400 million copies worldwide.AEI Speakers, American Entertainment International Speakers Bureau. \\"Robin Cook Biography\\". Second and fifth paragraphs.

He moved to Leonia, New Jersey when he was eight, where he could first have the \\"luxury\\" of having his own room. He graduated from Wesleyan University and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and finished his postgraduate medical training at Harvard.Cooking Another Medical Thriller , Naple News. By Sandy Reed. \\"Q&A; about [Robin Cook's] 31st book and much more.\\" Sixth paragraph. March 27, 2012. Retrieved April 7, 2012. Cook ran the Cousteau Society's blood-gas lab in the south of France. He later became an aquanaut (a submarine doc) with the U.S. Navy's SEALAB program when he was drafted in 1969. Cook served in the Navy from 1969 to 1971, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. He wrote his first novel, Year of the Intern, while serving on the Polaris submarine . Novelist The Year of the Intern was a failure, but Cook began to study bestsellers. He said, \\"I studied how the reader was manipulated by the writer. I came up with a list of techniques that I wrote down on index cards. And I used every one of them in Coma.\\" He conceived the idea for Coma, about illegally creating a supply of transplant organs, in 1975. In March 1977, that novel's paperback rights sold for $800,000. It was followed by the Egyptology thriller Sphinx in 1979 and another medical thriller, Brain, in 1981. Cook then decided he preferred writing over a career in medicine. Cook's novels combine medical fact with fantasy. His medical thrillers are designed, in part, to keep the public aware of both the technological possibilities of modern medicine and the ensuing socio-ethical problems which come along with it. Cook says he chose to write thrillers because the forum gives him \\"an opportunity to get the public interested in things about medicine that they didn't seem to know about. I believe my books are actually teaching people.\\" The author admits he never thought that he would have such compelling material to work with when he began writing fiction in 1970. \\"If I tried to be the writer I am today a number of years ago, I wouldn't have very much to write about. But today, with the pace of change in biomedical research, there are any number of different issues, and new ones to come,\\" he says. Cook's novels have anticipated national controversy. In an interview with Stephen McDonald about the novel Shock, Cook admitted the book's timing was fortuitous: To date, Cook has explored issues such as organ donation, fertility treatment, genetic engineering, in vitro fertilization, research funding, managed care, medical malpractice, medical tourism, drug research, and organ transplantation. Many of his novels revolve around hospitals (both fictional and non-fictional) in Boston, which may have to do with the fact that he underwent his post-graduate training at Harvard and has a residence in Boston, or in New York. Personal life He is on leave from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Cook is a private member of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees, led by chairman Joseph B. Gildenhorn, are appointed to six-year terms by the President of the United States.

The Pleo is taller than conventional kei car hatchbacks, but shorter than the definitive microvan, the Suzuki Wagon R, and is available with a variety of 658 cc I4 engines: SOHC, DOHC, and supercharged in two different trim levels. It competes with the Honda Life, Daihatsu Move, and the Mitsubishi Toppo in the tall wagon segment of kei cars in Japan. The name \\"pleo\\" is Latin meaning \\"to fill\\" or \\"to fulfill.\\" First generation ‚Äì RA1/RA2/RV1/RV2 (1998-2009) The first-generation Pleo first went on sale in Japan on October 9, 1998, replacing the Vivio (a conventional kei car hatchback), when Japanese regulations dictated a size change in the kei car tax bracket, and every kei car model from every make was redesigned as a result. The car was available with three variations of the EN07 engine; a naturally aspirated one with , a sporty supercharged one with , and also a \\"mildcharged\\" version which aimed for power characteristics similar to those of a one-liter car. The mildcharged version has a supercharger (with lower boost pressure) and . The original television advertisement for the Pleo broadcast nationally across Japan throughout the fourth quarter of 1998 featured a hip hop remix for the aria Un bel d√¨ vedremo from the opera Madama Butterfly by Italian composer Giacomo Puccini as its background music. The Vivio continued to be sold alongside the Pleo until the Vivio was discontinued on October 31. In June 1999, Subaru launched a retro-styled and better equipped edition of the Pleo, called the Nesta. This has a whole new front design, including new fenders, to accommodate a chromed grille and (twin) round headlights. It featured the entire engine range of the Pleo. In October, a sporty edition was launched, called the LS. At the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show, an LPG-powered prototype with a modernized version of the Nesta's front end was shown, with the name \\"Pleo Nicot,\\" although it was not to enter production for another year. In December, an Le edition was launched. In May 2000, Subaru launched a G Edition of the Pleo Nesta. In October, the first facelifted edition was launched. In December, the cheery-looking model called the Pleo Nicot was finally launched. Using single round headlights and a small smile-shaped grille, it used the Nesta's model-specific front fenders in a more modern way. The only engine option was the (gasoline-powered) mildcharged version. In May 2001, a more upgraded sporty version of the Pleo was launched, called the RS. This model is sometimes called the RM. In October, a second facelifted edition was launched. In January 2002, the L Plus Package and F Special editions were both launched. In May, three four-wheel drive editions, the RS Limited II, the LS Limited and the F Limited, were launched to commemorate Subaru 4WD's fortieth anniversary. In October, a third facelifted edition was launched. In May 2003, four editions of the Pleo, the FS Limited, the FS Special, the L Special and the Nesta GS Special, were launched. In June, the RS Limited and LS Limited were both facelifted. Meanwhile, a new edition of the Pleo, the L Special Color Selection, was launched. The R2, was introduced on December 8. After 2003, the Pleo was sold alongside the R2. As of January 2004, the supercharged engines were no longer available, leaving only the naturally aspirated version as the Pleo was repositioned beneath Subaru's newer kei class offerings. The mildcharged option returned twelve months later, only to disappear definitely in June 2006, after the Stella's introduction. In June 2007, the F model was discontinued. The discontinuation left the Van A model as the only trim level. In December 2009, the Pleo was discontinued.

Plot summary  The novel is set in a dystopian society in the very near future. Although it is not obvious at first, this is also an alternate history story. The central character is Haldane IV, a mathematician, in a caste-based society. He forms a forbidden relationship with Helix, a poet. He also becomes interested in investigating Fairweather, a famous mathematician who lived shortly before his time, and his son Fairweather II, whom he discovers led a rebellion, which was defeated. Eventually he is given a show trial and deported to another planet, where he meets Fairweather II. In this world, Jesus Christ became a revolutionary agitator and was never subjected to crucifixion. He assembled an army to overthrow the Roman Empire, and established a theocracy that has lasted until the twentieth century. He was killed by a crossbow while entering Rome, so the crossbow becomes a religious symbol similar to the cross in our time-line. Trilogy The book is supposedly the first in a trilogy. The other books appear to be The Pollinators of Eden, and The Rakehells of Heaven. Critical response Robert A. Heinlein said, \\"It belongs on the same shelf with 1984 and Brave New World,\\" and the Los Angeles Times noted, \\"In the literate tradition of Huxley, Orwell, and Bradbury, it is a work of extraordinary impact.\\" Joanna Russ, in her review of the book in 1969, was highly critical and wrote, \\"I forgive Mr. Boyd the anguish his novel caused me and hope he will eventually forgive me the anguish this review may cause him, but for Berkley there is no forgiveness. Only reform. Don't do it again.\\" Spider Robinson, however, praised the novel as \\"delightful, with a rigorously consistent internal logic that doesn't really become apparent until the very last chapter.\\"\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, December 1976, p.128 References * * External links *Fantastic Fiction on the novel Category:1968 American novels Category:1968 science fiction novels Category:Dystopian novels Category:American alternate history novels Category:Religion in science fiction Category:Alternate history novels set in ancient Rome ","title":"The Last Starship from Earth"},{"id":"646259","text":"Sabine River may refer to: *Sabine River (Texas‚ÄìLouisiana), USA *Sabine River (New Zealand) ","title":"Sabine River"},{"id":"646263","title":"Mitch Davis"},{"id":"646264","text":"An American marksman looks for enemy activity along the hilltops near Dur Baba District, Afghanistan (2006) G28 of the German Army A marksman is a person who is skilled in precision shooting using projectile weapons (in modern days most commonly an accurized scoped long gun such as designated marksman rifle or a sniper rifle) to shoot at high-value targets at longer-than-usual ranges. Description In popular and historical usage, \\"sharpshooter\\" and \\"marksman\\" are considered synonyms. Within the shooting sports and military usages today, however, sharpshooter and marksman refer to distinctly different levels of skill, which are never conflated. Specifically, in the US Army, \\"marksman\\" is a rating below \\"sharpshooter\\" and \\"expert\\". Four levels of skill are generally recognized today in American military and civilian shooting circles: unqualified, marksman, sharpshooter, and expert. Marksmanship badges for the three qualified levels are commonly awarded to both civilian and military shooters who attain proficiency in shooting higher than \\"unqualified\\". The main difference between military marksmen and snipers is that marksmen are usually considered an organic part of a fireteam of soldiers and are never expected to operate independently away from the main force, whereas snipers are special ops troops who usually work alone or in very small teams with independent mission objectives. Snipers are also often tasked with responsibilities other than delivering long-range fire ‚Äî specifically, conducting reconnaissance, battle damage assessment and spotting for coordinates/corrections for artillery fire or air strikes. Within the military, marksmen are sometimes attached to an infantry fireteam or squad (where they are known as designated marksmen) where they support the squad by providing accurate long-range shots at valuable targets as needed, thus extending the effective tactical reach of the fireteam or squad.  Usage  Marksmen competing in Australia  Middle ages  In the Middle Ages, in the first use of the term 'marksman' was given to the royal archers, or bowmen, of a palace guard, which was an elite group of troops chosen to guard a royal palace or the royalty. This was around the 10th century, although records of some 9th century English Kings show the listings of groups of marksmen specifically chosen for their militaries. Marksmen in different countries Australia In the Australian Army, marksmanship is currently recognized by the award of one of three skill-at-arms badges. The 'Skill at Arms Badge' consists of a representation of crossed .303 Short Magazine Lee‚ÄìEnfield (SMLE) rifles and is awarded for achieving a prescribed standard of shooting skill. This must be repeated within twelve months for the badge to be awarded in perpetuity to the recipient. The 'Sniper's Badge' is similar in design but incorporates the letter 'S' into the design and is awarded to soldiers who qualify on the Army Sniper's Course. The 'Army Top 20 Badge' consists of crossed .303 SMLE rifles upon a laurel wreath and is awarded to the final 20 competitors in the annual Champion Shot for the Army. The winner of this competition is also awarded the Champion Shots Medal. Only one badge may be worn. United Kingdom In the British Armed Forces, \\"marksman\\" is traditionally the highest shooting rating and holders may wear a crossed rifles badge on the lower sleeve. A British soldier aims on a shooting range in Iraq, 29 July 2006. :From Army Operational Shooting Policy for the Annual Personal Weapons Test (APWT) Combat Infantryman (CI):Marksman (Combat Infantryman). To qualify for Marksman all practices are to be completed and the firer must achieve a score of 55 (85%) or more of the total Highest Possible Score (65) for the entire shoot. Soldiers achieving a non-marksman passing score are not permitted to re-shoot practices in order to qualify for Marksman. Infantry soldiers who qualify as Marksmen during the Combat Infantryman's Course (CIC) are entitled to retain the award on joining their units. Soldiers who qualify as Marksmen are entitled to wear the Marksman badge for one year before they must requalify. (Page 3 - 70, Amdt 1/Feb/07) United States In the United States Army and Marine Corps, the marksmanship of the soldiers is ranked based on their skill: marksman- sharpshooter-expert. Holders of each level wear qualification badges below their ribbons with bars for the weapons they qualify in. In the United States Navy and the United States Coast Guard, full-sized medals are only issued at the expert level. Both services award separate medals for pistol and rifle proficiency. The United States Air Force gives just a ribbon for qualifying at the expert level, although a bronze star can be earned if the wearer qualifies on both of these types of small arms. U.S. Army soldiers fire a FGM-148 Javelin, 16 August 2006. Within the United States military, a marksman in the U.S. Army is referred to as \\"Squad Designated Marksman\\" (SDM), and a marksman in the Marines is called a \\"Designated Marksman\\" (DM). The United States Army particularly emphasizes the fireteam concept: according to US Army Field Manual 3-21.8Infantry Rifle Platoon and Squad, FM 7-8 (Infantry Rifle Platoon and Squad, formerly FM 7-8) a typical United States Army fireteam consists of four soldiers. In the context of a Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT)'s Infantry Rifle Companies, one man from each fireteam in a rifle squad is either the Squad Anti-armor Specialist (RMAT), armed with the FGM-148 Javelin, or the Squad Designated Marksman (DM), who carries the M4 carbine and M14 rifle. In both cases this specialized function replaces the basic rifleman position in the fireteam. Canada As with other Commonwealth armies, the Marksman in the Canadian Army is a shooting achievement recognized by a badge bearing the monarch's crown and crossed .303 Lee‚ÄìEnfield No. 4, Mk I rifles. On operations within the Canadian Infantry Battalion, rifle company designated marksman can be assigned. This is not to be confused with Canadian sniper designation; these attain a high level of marksmanship and fieldcraft through grueling selected courses. Candidates must achieve recce qualification and marksman designation before being considered for the basic sniper course. India The Indian Army uses a locally manufactured licensed variant of the SVD Dragunov in the Designated Marksman role as part of each infantry platoon. The Dragunov is used in conjunction with the INSAS family of weapons to give flexibility and striking power at short to mid range firefights, to Indian Army infantry units engaged with opposing forces. The Army Marksmanship Unit trains members for sports shooting as well as military shooting. Civilian marksman United States Sharpshooter from confederate state The United States has a long tradition of marksmanship going back to its beginnings including the role of common men in its Revolutionary War. There are several organizations which promote civilian marksmanship including the Civilian Marksmanship Program which began just after the turn of the 20th century as a government chartered program and the Division of Civilian Marksmanship. One of the newest and currently the fastest growing marksmanship programs in North America is Project Appleseed which was started by the Revolutionary War Veterans Association in 2006. Shooters who score 210 out of 250 or better on the \\"Quick and Dirty\\" Appleseed AQT earn the Rifleman designation and are issued a Rifleman patch. Similar to the U.S. military marksmanship ratings of Unqualified, Marksman, Sharpshooter, and Expert (see Marksmanship Badge (United States)), the Appleseed ratings have the same levels, with the exception that instead of \\"Expert\\", the equivalent performance level is called \\"Rifleman\\". The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is an American nonprofit organization founded in 1871 that sponsors marksmanship events featuring shooting skill and sports.

Overview Oblasts are a constituent political entity in a federal union under with representation in the Federation Council, and serve as a first- level administrative division. Each oblast features a state government holding authority over a defined geographic territory, with a state legislature, the Oblast Duma, that is democratically elected. The Governor is the highest executive position of the state government in an Oblast, and is elected by people. Oblasts are divided into raions (districts), cities of oblast significance (district-equivalent independent cities), and autonomous okrugs, which are legally federal subjects equal to an oblast but are administratively subservient to one. Currently only 2 oblasts still have autonomous okrugs: Arkhangelsk Oblast (Nenets Autonomous Okrug) and Tyumen Oblast (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug). The term oblast can be translated into English as \\"province\\" or \\"region\\", and there are currently 46 oblasts, the most common type of the 85 federal subjects in Russia. The majority of oblasts are named after their administrative center, the official term for a capital city in an oblast, which is generally the largest city. Exceptions to this include Leningrad Oblast and Moscow Oblast, which have no official capital, and Sakhalin Oblast, which is named after a geographic location. Leningrad Oblast and Sverdlovsk Oblast retain the previous names of Saint Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, respectively. Oblasts are typically areas that are predominantly populated by ethnic Russians and native Russian language speakers, and are mostly located in European Russia. The largest oblast by geographic size is Tyumen Oblast at 1,435,200km2 (excluding autonomous okrugs Irkutsk Oblast is the largest at 767,900km2) and the smallest is Kaliningrad Oblast at 15,100km2. The most populous oblast is Moscow Oblast at 7,095,120 and the least populous is Magadan Oblast at 156,996. Comparison with other types of federal subjects Krais, another type of federal subject, are legally identical to oblasts and the difference between a political entity with the name \\"oblast\\" or \\"krai\\" is purely traditional. History In the Russian Empire, oblasts were a third-level administrative division, organized in 1849 and few in number, dividing the larger guberniyas (governorates) within the first-level krais. Following the numerous administration reforms during the Soviet era, the number of oblasts gradually increased as they became the primary top-level administrative division of the Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs), the constituent political entities of the Soviet Union. These oblasts held very little autonomy or power, but when the Soviet Union dissolved into sovereign states along the lines of the SSRs, they became the first-level administrative divisions. The oblasts of the Russian SFSR, which transitioned into the Russian Federation, became the first-level administrative divisions of the new country and received greater devolved power.

In English the original French bailie combined with '-wic', the Anglo-Saxon suffix (meaning a village) to produce a term meaning literally 'bailiff's village'‚Äîthe original geographic scope of a bailiwick. In the 19th century, it was absorbed into American English as a metaphor for a sphere of knowledge or activity. The term survives in administrative usage in the British Crown dependencies of the Channel Islands, which are grouped for administrative purposes into two bailiwicks ‚Äî Jersey (comprising the island of Jersey and uninhabited islets such as the Minquiers and √âcr√©hous) and Guernsey (comprising the islands of Guernsey, Sark, Alderney, Brecqhou, Herm, Jethou and Lihou). A Bailiff heads each Channel Island bailiwick. A bailiwick () was also the territorial division of the Teutonic Order. Here, various ‚ÄúKomtur(en)‚Äù formed a Ballei province. The word is now more generally used in a metaphorical sense, to indicate a sphere of authority, experience, activity, study, or interest. Origin The term originated in France (bailie being the Old French term for a bailiff). Under the ancien r√©gime in France, the bailli was the king's representative in a bailliage, charged with the application of justice and control of the administration. In southern France, the term generally used was s√©n√©chal (cf seneschal) who held office in the s√©n√©chauss√©e. The administrative network of baillages was established in the 13th century, based on the earlier medieval fiscal and tax divisions (the 'baillie') which had been used by earlier sovereign princes. (For more on this French judicial system, see bailli, pr√©v√¥t and Early Modern France.) Bailiwick of Bicester Market End At Bicester in Oxfordshire, the lord of the manor of Market End was the Earl of Derby who, in 1597, sold a 9,999 year lease to 31 principal tenants. This in effect gave the manorial rights to the leaseholders, ‚Äòpurchased for the benefit of those inhabitants or others who might hereafter obtain parts of the demesne‚Äô. The leaseholders elected a bailiff to receive the profits from the bailiwick, mainly from the administration of the market and distribute them to the shareholders. From the bailiff's title, the arrangement became known as the Bailiwick of Bicester Market End. By 1752 all of the original leases were in the hands of ten men, who leased the bailiwick control of the market to two local tradesmen.

One hundred Boys Nation Senators are chosen from a pool of over 20,000 Boys State participants, making it one of the most selective educational programs in the United States. Each year, two delegates in the summer after their junior year of high school are selected from each of the fifty American Legion Boys State programs in the United States (Hawaii does not host a Boys State however Washington DC does). These delegates attend a week-long event in Washington, DC funded by scholarships. The event endeavors to teach delegates about the processes of the Federal government of the United States by establishing a mock Senate and organizing mock elections of a Boys Nation Senate President Pro Tempore, Senate Secretary, Vice President, and President. Senators also attend lectures and forums, and visit governmental institutions and historical sites. Tom Brokaw and former president Bill Clinton were previous Boys Nation representatives. It is a tradition for the student senators to take a private tour of the White House and be received by the current president. Boys Nation Senators also ordinarily receive private tours of the United States Supreme Court, the Congress, the Pentagon, and the State Department. Students assume the role of a United States Senator, representing their respective (Boys) State. They write and introduce bills and debate in the senate chambers. Delegates are split into political parties and draft a party platform as well as perform usual party duties like nominations for president and vice- president, along with elected party leadership.

See image file for their \\"Dragendorff numbers\\". Hans Dragendorff (15 October 1870 in Dorpat (Tartu), Estonia - 29 January 1941 in Freiburg, Germany) was a Baltic German scholar who introduced the first classification system for the type of Ancient Roman pottery known as Samian ware or Terra sigillata, in 1896, using type numbers. His scheme was based on the varying forms the vessels took and although it has since been augmented and refined by others, it is still common to refer to 'Dragendorff type 37' bowls for example. Dragendorff studied in Dorpat, Berlin and Bonn with Georg Loeschcke and received his doctorate in 1894 for his work on Terra sigillata. He held an extraordinary chair in Basel till 1902, when he became director of the newly founded \\"R√∂misch-Germanische Kommission\\" (RGK) of the 'Deutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut' (DAI), a post which he held until 1911. From 1911 to 1922 he was secretary general of the DAI. In 1922, he took a chair in Freiburg, a post he held until 1933.

Ingram Douglass Marshall (born May 10, 1942 in Mount Vernon, New York) is an American composer and a former student of Vladimir Ussachevsky and Morton Subotnick. Early life and education Son of Bernice Douglass and Harry Reinhard Marshall, Sr, Marshall's early interest in music was the result of encouragement provided by his mother, herself an accomplished pianist and vocalist. As a youth, he performed as a soprano in the Boy's Choir at the Mt. Vernon Community Church, and during his high school years was influenced early by noted music instructor, Victor Laslo. After graduating from the Fox Lane High School in 1960, he pursued musical studies at Lake Forest College and Columbia University. In 1970 he became graduate assistant to Morton Subotnik at Cal Arts, staying on to teach for several years after receiving his MFA in 1971. Career Though the composer uses the term \\"expressivist\\" to describe his music, he is often associated with post-minimalism. His music often reflects an interest in world music, particularly Balinese gamelan tradition, as well as influence from the American minimalism trends of the 1960s (the composer often acknowledges the work of Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and John Adams). He first gained recognition for his electroacoustic pieces, often performed by the composer himself on synthesizer, tape looping, gambuh (a traditional Balinese flute), and voice (\\"Fragility Cycles\\" [1978] is one of his best known works using this method of solo performance). His acoustic music frequently incorporates tape delay, and later, digital delay (such as \\"Soe Pa\\", for solo classical guitar, and \\"Hymnodic Delays\\" for the Theatre of Voices). Many of the tape parts of his pieces include the composer's own keening falsetto and gambuh playing (such as \\"Fog Tropes\\" and \\"Gradual Requiem\\" (1980)). Some of his works were produced in coordination with the assistance of noted Norwegian photographer, James Bengston of Studio Nord in Oslo. He has written for the Kronos Quartet: Voces Resonae (1984) and Fog Tropes II (1982), featured in the film \\"Shutter Island,\\" and for the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra: Orphic Memories (2006). He joined the music faculty at The Evergreen State College and later moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where he is now a professor at the Yale School of Music. He was the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and studied gamelan music in Bali. In 1990 he was awarded a doctorate of philosophy in music by Lake Forest College, largely in recognition of his Fulbright award and gamelan studies in Bali.

He was the founder of the Thule Society, a post-World War I German occultist organization where he played a key role, and that influenced many members of the National Socialist German Workers Party. He was a Freemason, a Sufi of the Bektashi order - after his conversion to IslamMark Sedgwick, Against the Modern World, Oxford University Press (2004), p. 66 \\\\- and a practitioner of meditation, astrology, numerology, and alchemy.Ellic Howe, Urania's Children He also used the alias Erwin Torre. Early life Glauer was born in Hoyerswerda in the Prussian Province of Silesia (present-day Saxony), the son of a locomotive engineer. He appears to have worked as a technician in Egypt between 1897‚Äì1900, although according to his own account he spent less than a month there in 1900 after a short career as a merchant sailor. In July of that year he travelled to Turkey, where he settled in 1901 and worked as an engineer on a large estate there. By 1905 he had returned to Dresden where he married Klara Voss, but the couple divorced in 1907. The M√ºnchener Post (14 March 1923) reported that he was sentenced as a swindler and forger in 1909, which Goodrick-Clarke (1985: 251) insists is a misprint for 1908. He became an Ottoman citizen in 1911 and was apparently adopted (under Turkish law) by the expatriate Baron Heinrich von Sebottendorff shortly thereafter. The adoption was later repeated in Germany and its legal validity has been questioned, but it was endorsed by the Sebottendorff family (Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 140-41) and on this basis he asserted his claim to the Sebottendorff name and to the title of Freiherr. After fighting on the Ottoman-Turkish side in the First Balkan War, Glauer returned to Germany with a Turkish passport in 1913. He was exempted from military service during the First World War because of his Ottoman citizenship and because of a wound received during the First Balkan War. He died in Istanbul at 8 May, 1945. Occult and mystical influences Glauer was introduced to occultism and esoteric concerns when he was living in Bursa, Turkey. His wealthy host, Hussein Pasha, was a Sufi and interested in such matters; it was around this time that Glauer saw the Mevlevi Order and visited the Great Pyramid of Giza in July 1900.. At Bursa, Glauer became acquainted with the Termudi family, who were Jews from Thessaloniki. The Termudi family were involved in banking and the silk trade. They were also Freemasons, belonging to a lodge affiliated to the Rite of Memphis-Misraim. This network of lodges was closely connected to the Committee of Union and Progress (which later joined the Young Turks).Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 138 and see Howard 1989: 124 (\\"In 1901 von Sebottendorf was initiated into a Masonic lodge which, like many in the Middle East, had connections with the French Grand Orient\\"). Furthermore: \\"the masonic lodge, which Glauer had joined at Bursa in 1901, may have been a local cadre of the pre-revolutionary Secret Society of Union and Progress, founded on the model of Freemasonry by Salonican Turks to generate liberal consciousness during the repressive reign of the Sultan.\\" (Goodrick-Clarke, op. cit., 139). The patriarch of the Termudi family initiated Glauer into the lodge and when Termudi died, he bequeathed his library of occult, Kabbalistic, Rosicrucian and Sufi texts to Glauer.. One of the books that Glauer inherited from Termudi featured a note from Hussein Pasha, which piqued his interest in the Sufi Bektashi Order, in regards to their alchemical and numerological practices.Sebottendorff, Der Talisman des Rosenkreuzers, 1925: 65-68, cit. in Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 138, 251. Speculations say he might have converted to Islam with Sufi-orientation, although the evidence (from his own semi- autobiographical writings) is rather tenuous on this point. In his autobiographical novel Der Talisman des Rosenkreuzers (The Rosicrucian Talisman), Sebottendorff distinguishes between Sufi-influenced Turkish Masonry and conventional Masonry. By about 1912 he became convinced that he had discovered what he called \\"the key to spiritual realization\\", described by a later historian as \\"a set of numerological meditation exercises that bear little resemblance to either Sufism or Masonry\\" (Sedgwick 2004: 66). Involvement with the Thule Society By 1916, Glauer had attracted only one follower. In that year, however, he came into contact with the Germanenorden, and was subsequently appointed the Ordensmeister (local group leader) for the Bavaria division of the schismatic Germanenorden Walvater of the Holy Grail. Settling in Munich, he established the Thule Society, which became increasingly political. On 5 January 1919 Anton Drexler, who had developed links between the Thule Society and various extreme right workers' organizations in Munich, together with the Thule Society's Karl Harrer, established the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP), or German Workers' Party. This party was joined in September 1919 by Adolf Hitler, who transformed it into the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Glauer was also the owner of the V√∂lkischer Beobachter, which the NSDAP purchased in December 1920 on the initiative of Chase Bauduin and Dietrich Eckart, who became the first editors. In 1921, Hitler acquired all shares in the company, making him the sole owner of the publication. The paper was to become Hitler‚Äôs most important propaganda tool. By then, however, Glauer had left the Thule Society and Bavaria, having been accused of negligence in allegedly allowing the names of several key Thule Society members to fall into the hands of the government of the short- lived Bavarian Soviet Republic, resulting in the execution of seven members after the attack on the Munich government in April 1919, an accusation that he never denied. Sebottendorf fled Germany for Switzerland and then Turkey. Later life After leaving Germany, Glauer published Die Praxis der alten t√ºrkischen Freimauerei: Der Schl√ºssel zum Verst√§ndnis der Alchimie (\\"The practice of ancient Turkish Freemasonry: The key to the understanding of alchemy\\"), and then, in 1925, Der Talisman des Rosenkreuzers, a semi- autobiographical novel which is the main source for his earlier life (see: \\"Rosicrucians\\"). He returned to Germany in January 1933, and published Bevor Hitler kam: Urkundlich aus der Fr√ºhzeit der Nationalsozialistischen Bewegung (\\"Before Hitler Came: Documents from the Early Days of the National Socialist Movement\\"), dealing with the Thule Society and the DAP. Hitler himself understandably disliked this book, which was banned. Glauer was arrested, but somehow escaped (presumably due to some friendship from his Munich days) and in 1934 returned to Turkey.Sedgwick, page 97 Glauer was an agent of the German military intelligence in neutral Istanbul during the period 1942-1945, while apparently also working as a double agent for the British military. His German handler, Herbert Rittlinger, later described him as a \\"useless\\" agent (eine Null), but kept him on largely, it seems, because of an affection for \\"this strange, by then penniless man, whose history he did not know, who pretended enthusiasm for the Nazi cause and admiration for the SS but who in reality seemed little interested in either, much preferring to talk about Tibetans\\". Glauer is generally thought to have committed suicide by jumping into the Bosphorus on 8 May 1945. Notes Bibliography Works * 1924.

They issued 11 albums, including a collaborative album with Jello Biafra, as well as numerous EPs and singles. Critic Martin Popoff described their music as \\"the mightiest merger between the hateful aggression of punk and the discipline of heavy metal.\\"Popoff, Martin: \\"The Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal\\", page 316. CG Publishing, 1997 Nomeansno's distinct hardcore punk sound, complex instrumentation, and dark, \\"savagely intelligent\\" lyrics inspired subsequent musicians. They are often considered foundational in the punk jazz and post-hardcore movements, and have been cited as a formative influence on the math rock and emo genres. Formed in 1979 by brothers Rob and John Wright, the group began as a two-piece punk band influenced by jazz and progressive rock. They self-released their debut Mama LP in 1982. Adding guitarist Andy Kerr the following year, the group signed with the Alternative Tentacles imprint and continued to expand their audience. Kerr departed in 1992 after five LPs with the band, and the group returned to its two-piece formation for the Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy? album. Guitarist Tom Holliston, and briefly second drummer Ken Kempster, joined in 1993, and Nomeansno continued touring and recording extensively while operating their own Wrong Records label. After three further LPs, they left Alternative Tentacles and issued their final album, All Roads Lead to Ausfahrt, in 2006. They were inducted into the Western Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2015, and announced their retirement the following year. History Early years as two-piece, Mama (1979‚Äì1982) In 1979 and at age 25, Rob Wright returned to his family's home in Victoria after studying in Calgary.Black, Mark; (2012) NoMeansNo: Going Nowhere, Invisible Press, John Wright, Rob's younger brother by eight years, played drums in the school jazz band, and the two were inspired to play punk rock after seeing D.O.A. perform at the University of Victoria.Barclay, Michael; Jack, Ian A. D.; Schneider, Jason (2011) Have Not Been the Same: The CanRock Renaissance 1985*1995, ECW Press, They began rehearsing in their parents' basement in 1979, and took the name Nomeansno from an anti-date rape slogan. They also briefly gigged as the rhythm section for the local cover band Castle. Nomeansno recorded its earliest material in the months that followed on a TASCAM four-track recorder, with Rob playing electric guitar and bass, John playing keyboards and drums, and both brothers singing. Some of these recordings were issued as their first two self-released 7\\"s, the \\"Look, Here Come the Wormies / SS Social Service\\" single (a 1980 split with Mass Appeal, whose recording lineup featured both Wright Brothers), and the Betrayal, Fear, Anger, Hatred EP of 1981. The brothers began performing live as a bass-and-drums duo in 1981. Their sound developed without a guitar, and John Wright later reflected on these developments: Some of the songs they played in this period were released on the Mama LP, which was self-released in a limited pressing in 1982. Writing for Trouser Press, critic Ira Robbins described Mama and the early 7\\"s as \\"Devo on a jazz trip, Mot√∂rhead after art school, or Wire on psychotic steroids.\\" This same year, John Wright also joined the Victoria punk band The Infamous Scientists. With Andy Kerr, You Kill Me, Small Parts Isolated and Destroyed (1983‚Äì1989) The Infamous Scientists disbanded in 1983, and their guitarist and vocalist Andy Kerr joined Nomeansno several months later.Earles, Andrew (2014) Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981-1996, Voyageur Press, Kerr brought a distinct hardcore punk edge to Nomeansno's sound, creating a buzz-saw guitar tone by playing through a Fender Bassman amplifier and a P.A. speaker. Nomeansno became a fixture in the British Columbia punk scene despite playing music that did not always conform to punk rock standards. The You Kill Me EP in 1985 on the Undergrowth Records imprint exhibited their experimental sound on dark and ponderous songs like \\"Body Bag\\" and a cover of \\"Manic Depression\\" by Jimi Hendrix. The three also began performing Ramones covers and more traditional punk music as The Hanson Brothers, a side project that would later receive more of their attention. Issued initially by the Montreal punk label Psyche Industry, the band released Sex Mad, their second LP and first with Kerr. The album further expanded the band's experimental and progressive punk sound, yielding the single \\"Dad\\". The song was a minor college radio hit, which AllMusic reviewer Adam Bregman called \\"a bit chilling, even though it's spit out at slam-pit's pace\\". Kerr, the song's lead vocalist, increasingly became responsible for lead vocals as Rob Wright suffered from nodules on his vocal cords. They soon signed with the seminal punk rock label Alternative Tentacles, run by Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys. This, along with frequent touring in North America and Europe, helped the band to garner a larger audience. In 1988, the group issued two releases recorded with producer Cecil English: The Day Everything Became Nothing EP and the Small Parts Isolated and Destroyed album. Alternative Tentacles compiled the two together on a single CD, The Day Everything Became Isolated and Destroyed. AllMusic reviewer Sean Carruthers called the experimental recordings \\"less aggressive\\" than, but nonetheless worthy of, the band's previous efforts. Wrong, 0 + 2 = 1, Kerr's departure (1989‚Äì1992) Wrong Rob Wright's vocal cords began to heal, and he again began acting as the group's lead vocalist. In 1989, the band issued their fourth album, Wrong, to wide critical acclaim. For AllMusic, Carruthers wrote that \\"[t]he playing is incredibly skilled;\\" critic Martin Popoff in writing for The Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal called Wrong the band's best album and rated the album 10 out of 10 points. The band's extensive touring in support of the record is documented in part on the Live + Cuddly album, recorded in Holland in 1990. John Wright later reported that circa 1990 the band became profitable enough that \\"we didn't have to have day jobs.\\" The band released a collaborative LP with Biafra, The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy, in 1991. Shortly thereafter, they issued 0 + 2 = 1, their fifth album and final release with Kerr. In a mixed review, AllMusic critic Adam Bregman praised 0 + 2 = 1 for its finer moments, but was concerned by its overall length and ponderousness. Kerr departed the band after touring in support of the record and emigrated to the Netherlands. He went on to release two LPs with Hissanol, a collaboration with Scott Henderson of Shovelhed. He subsequently released a solo album in 1997 before forming the duo Two Pin Din with Wilf Plum of Dog Faced Hermans in 2005. Side projects, Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy? (1992‚Äì1993) The Wright brothers had begun to focus on their side project, The Hanson Brothers. Dressing as a mock group of backward Canadian ice hockey players and fans, they derived the band's name and personae from a group of characters in the 1977 George Roy Hill film Slap Shot starring Paul Newman. With John acting as lead vocalist, the Wright brothers were joined by guitarist Tom Holliston of the Showbusiness Giants and drummer Ken Jensen of D.O.A. With encouragement from Alternative Tentacles to record an LP, The Hanson Brothers issued the Gross Misconduct album in 1992. The Wright brothers also remained active with other endeavors. Rob Wright began performing as a solo artist under the name Mr. Wrong, appearing as a character dressed as an authoritarian priest. John Wright became a member of D.O.A. for several years. The brothers also continued to expand Wrong Records, their own imprint. In 1993, the brothers assembled material for a sixth Nomeansno LP and recorded Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy? as a duo. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett later praised the album's balance, arguing that it reached dark and sinister depths while also exhibiting subtler and more introspective moments. The Wrights also compiled the collection Mr. Right & Mr. Wrong: One Down & Two to Go, comprising early demos, studio outtakes, and additional material, which was released on Wrong the following year. With Tom Holliston, Worldhood of the World (As Such), Dance of the Headless Bourgeoisie (1993‚Äì1999) For touring in support of Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy?, Nomeansno assembled their first four-piece lineup, completed by Hanson Brothers guitarist Holliston and second drummer Ken Kempster. Holliston replaced Kerr as their full-time guitarist, while Kempster went on to tour sporadically with Nomeansno over the next four years. The first Nomeansno album to feature Holliston was The Worldhood of the World (As Such), released in 1995. Receiving its title from philosopher Martin Heidegger's seminal text Being and Time, the album featured simpler and more melodic songs than its predecessors while nonetheless retaining the band's \\"taste for blood and gristle.\\" After focusing briefly on the Hanson Brothers and releasing their second LP, Sudden Death, Nomeansno followed with the EPs Would We Be Alive? and In the Fishtank 1, each featuring a cover of \\"Would We Be Alive?\\" by The Residents. Their eighth studio album, the double LP Dance of the Headless Bourgeoisie, was released in 1998. The album featured some of the band's longest songs, including its title track. The album received mixed, but generally positive, reviews. In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Tom Schulte praised the album in its experimental tone as \\"dark and unforgettable, poignant and cutting.\\" A critic writing for The A.V. Club, however, dismissed the album as \\"dull, meandering punk\\" and likened the band pejoratively to Rush. One, All Roads Lead to Ausfahrt (2000‚Äì2006) The band was a three- piece featuring (from left to right) Tom Holliston, John Wright, and Rob Wright in its final two decades. The band issued its final Alternative Tentacles album, One, in 2000. Featuring a slow stoner rock cover of The Ramones's \\"Beat on the Brat\\" and a fifteen-minute version of Miles Davis's \\"Bitches Brew\\" with electric piano and congas, the album was well received. AllMusic's Schulte assessed the album as \\"intense and heavy collegiate punk\\" as praised it as the band's finest effort since Wrong. Three outtakes from the album were also issued as the Generic Shame EP on Wrong. The band left Alternative Tentacles in 2002, and began slowly reissuing their back catalogue through Wrong and distributors Southern Records. With new drummer Ernie Hawkins, The Hanson Brothers released their third album, My Game, later that year. Nomeansno continued touring extensively, but ultimately took six years to release their next album. In the meantime, they issued the best-of compilation The People's Choice. Their tenth studio album, All Roads Lead to Ausfahrt, was released on August 22, 2006 by AntAcidAudio in the United States and Southern in Europe. AllMusic critic Jo-Ann Greene praised the album's exhausting diversity as befitting of the band's legacy and career-spanning accomplishments. Greene wrote that with the record Nomeansno travel \\"yet again through the undergrowth and underbelly of the rock realm, and with all the piss and vinegar that they started out with a quarter century ago.\\" Later years, retirement (2007‚Äì2016) The band toured frequently in the years that followed, but ceased recording albums. Fang drummer Mike Branum joined The Hanson Brothers in 2008. In 2010, Nomeansno digitally released outtakes and demos from the 0 + 2 = 1 sessions as 0 + 2 = 1 ¬Ω. They next released two four- track EPs, Tour EP 1 (alternatively known as Old) and Tour EP 2 (alternatively Jubilation). They continued performing live through 2013, and toured as The Hanson Brothers in the following year with Byron Slack on drums, but entered a hiatus thereafter. Holliston continued to perform with The Showbusiness Giants and release solo albums, while John Wright began working as musical director for the all-robot rock band Compressorhead. In 2015, Nomeansno was inducted into the Western Canadian Music Hall of Fame. They played an acoustic set at the awards ceremony, and a Ramones cover set (with Slack on drums) on New Year's Eve, which became their final public appearances. Holliston announced his departure from the band in August 2016. On September 24, John Wright announced the band's official retirement.

History Formation Henry J Ryman opened his first store as a book printer on Great Portland Street, London in 1893, that is still open today. Quickly changing the focus to selling stationery, the business was successfully owned and managed by the Ryman family for several generations. Jack Ryman succeeded Henry in 1931, until he passed it on to his own sons, Desmond and Nicholas, in 1951. At the time that Desmond and Nicholas assumed control from father, the company comprised eleven shops.

He developed a relationship with the then marketing director; Malcolm Cooke and this eventually led to Paphitis purchasing Ryman from the receivers in March 1995. The purchase was made through Chancerealm Ltd (which later changed its name to Ryman Group Limited). In 1996, the Ryman Direct mail order catalogue was introduced, followed by a website in 1998. To build a national chain, in the United Kingdom, in September 2001, the group acquired the stationery retailer Partners with 86 stores, and in February 2007, purchased 61 stores of Stationery Box. The businesses and all stores were combined under a redesigned Ryman brand in October 2008, which presently comprises 210 stores with a turnover of more than ¬£125m.

He was orphaned at the age of seven and after having been educated in Paris, he was sent to Saint Malo to study navigation. He became a lieutenant of the French East India Company in 1731. He succeeded in convincing his employer to provide him with two ships and send him on an exploration mission in the South Atlantic. With his ships Aigle and Marie he discovered on 1 January 1739 a tiny island which was named Bouvet Island after him; however, he mislabeled the coordinates for the island, causing it to be lost until it was rediscovered seven decades later in 1808. Shortly afterwards, he had to abandon the expedition because most of his crew had fallen ill; his ship then called at the Cape of Good Hope and returned to France. Ten years after his expedition, Bouvet de Lozier was appointed governor of the Mascarene Islands twice, once from 1750 to 1752 and a second time from 1757 to 1763.

He read for the law and was admitted to the bar in 1746. He became a member of the militia, then in 1747 was elected justice of the peace and a member of the colonial assembly. He was also involved in several of the land development schemes for the Susquehanna and Wyoming Valley areas. In the French and Indian War Dyer was a Lt. Colonel in the militia. He participated in the expedition that captured Crown Point from the French, as a Colonel of the Third Connecticut Provincial Regiment, in 1755. In 1758, as a Colonel, he led his regiment to Canada in support of Amherst‚Äôs and Wolfe‚Äôs operations. In 1763 he visited London as an agent for the Susquehanna Land Company in a failed attempt to gain title for a colonial venture to the Wyoming region. Connecticut sent Dyer to New York for the Stamp Act Congress. This congress of protest was an important precursor to the American Revolution.

Church is a historically black denomination within the broader context of Methodism. It is also occasionally considered to be a mainline denomination. The group was organized on December 16, 1870 in Jackson, Tennessee, when several black ministers, with the full support of their white sponsors in the former Methodist Episcopal Church, South, met to form an organization that would allow them to establish and maintain their own polity. They ordained their own bishops and ministers without their being officially endorsed or appointed by the white-dominated body. They called this fellowship the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in America, which it remained until their successors adopted the current name in the 1950s. Chalk Level C.M.E. Church in Harnett County, North Carolina Organization In the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, bishops are administrative superintendents of the church; they are elected by \\"delegate\\" votes for as many years deemed until the age of 74, when he/she must retire. Among their duties are responsibility for appointing clergy to serve local churches as pastor, for performing ordinations, and for safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the Church. The General Conference, a meeting every four years, comprises an equal number of clergy and lay delegates. In each Annual Conference, CME bishops serve for four-year terms. CME Church bishops may be male or female. In 2006, there were an estimated 850,000 members in 3,500 churches. Religious beliefs The Methodist Articles of Religion state the church's primary beliefs. Social Creed The C.M.E. Church has set forth a Social Creed. Hymnal and responsive readings Sunday worship services in the CME denomination commonly include a Responsive Reading from scripture. A leader reads a line of scripture and the congregation reads a response. Bible passages are not arranged by topic; responsive readings are. Often, a single responsive reading consists of excerpts from several Bible passages. The CME Responsive Readings are published in The Hymnal of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. Items 1‚Äì545 are songs, and items 546‚Äì604 are Responsive Readings. The official Responsive Readings are from the King James Version of the Bible. CME Connectional Emblem CME Connectional Emblem The official logo or symbol of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church was originally authorized by Bishop B. Julian Smith for the Centennial General Conference held in Memphis, 1970. It was officially adopted by the General Conference in 1974 as the denomination's connectional marker. Designed by Will E. Chambers, the logo shows the place of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in the rapidly changing urbanized society and its relation to God's people. The logo is composed of: :The World Globe which represents the vineyard of God; :The Skyline which stands for the Church's concern for human and urban problems and people's alienation from God and one another; :The Weather Vane which symbolizes the need of the Church to be flexible in terms of meeting the contemporary needs of people; and, :The Cross which denotes, by its vertical bar, the need for a proper relationship between people and God, and by its horizontal bar, the need for proper relationships between people. The total Cross is a sign of the final-assured victory through the blood of Jesus Christ. Ecumenical activity Since the early 20th century the CME Church has explored the possibility of merging with other African American Methodist churches that are very similar in doctrine and practice. In 1918 representatives of the CME Church, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion (AME Zion) Church met in Birmingham, Alabama where they agreed to propose a merger. This \\"Birmingham Plan\\" was approved by the CME General Conference but did not win enough support in the annual conferences. in the late 20th century, the CME Church engaged in new talks with the AME Zion Church on a merger, with CME General Conference delegates approving a union in principle in 1986, and AME Zion delegates giving the same approval in 1988. Bishops of each church reopened the question in 1999, adopting a timeline for an eventual merger. In May 2012, The Christian Methodist Episcopal Church entered into full communion with the United Methodist Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, African Union Methodist Protestant Church, African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church. These Churches agreed to \\"recognize each other‚Äôs churches, share sacraments, and affirm their clergy and ministries.\\" Notable Bishops *1st Bishop William Henry Miles (1828- 1892) *2nd Bishop Richard H.

It was fought a month after the Battle of the Dardanelles. The battle was triggered by Dmitry Senyavin's retreat from the Dardanelles, which he had been blockading since March, towards the Russian naval base at Tenedos. The Ottoman commander, Kapudan Pasha Seydi Ali Pasha, ventured with 9 ships of the line, 5 frigates and 5 other vessels out of the strait into the Aegean Sea. Thereupon Senyavin returned to cut off his retreat and fell upon the Ottoman fleet halfway between Mount Athos and Lemnos. Trying to avoid a battle or distraction from Tenedos, the Turkish fleet went around him on the south side and rushed to the west. Senyavin, leaving the smaller ships to help the fortress, set out to find the enemy, and found him on 19 June in an unsettled situation at anchor between the island of Lemnos and Athos Mountain. From his previous experience, Senyavin had learned that the Ottomans fought bravely unless their flagship was sunk or taken captive. He therefore ordered Aleksey Greig and other captains of his ships of the line to concentrate their attack on the three Ottoman flagships, whilst other Russian vessels were to prevent Ottoman frigates from delivering help. The Russians approached in two parallel lines of five ships of the line each, turning north to run alongside the Ottoman line. During the battle 3 Ottoman ships of the line and four frigates ‚Äì around one third of the Sultan's fleet ‚Äì were either sunk or forced aground. The rest retired to the safety of the Dardanelles. On the way they scuttled another ship of the line and a frigate near Thasos on 4 July and lost a frigate and a sloop near Samothrace on about 5 July. In the morning of 20 June it was revealed that the whole Turkish fleet, running before the wind, was going north to the island of Thassos. A ship of the line and two frigates (the former captain of the ship helped Bey) were cut off their squadron by the Russians. On 21 June Senyavin dispatched rear-admiral Greig with three ships of the line in pursuit of the latter, but the Turks ran their ships ashore and burned them. At dawn of 22 June in the retreating Turkish squadron exploded another ship of the line and a frigate, and two damaged frigates sank off the island of Samothrace. Of the 20 Turkish ships in the Dardanelles, only 12 returned. Russian Fleet after the Battle of Athos, by Aleksey Bogolyubov (1824‚Äì96). On 23 June Senyavin decided not to pursue the enemy and return to help beleaguered Tenedos. However, due to the wind and calms he arrived there just on 25 June. Turkish troops surrendered, and, leaving all their guns and arms, were transported to the Anatolian coast. As a result of the battle, the Ottoman Empire lost a combat-capable fleet for more than a decade and signed an armistice with Russia on 12 August.

He was awarded a Fields Medal in 1954, being the first Japanese national to receive this honour.  Early years  Kodaira was born in Tokyo. He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1938 with a degree in mathematics and also graduated from the physics department at the University of Tokyo in 1941. During the war years he worked in isolation, but was able to master Hodge theory as it then stood. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Tokyo in 1949, with a thesis entitled Harmonic fields in Riemannian manifolds. He was involved in cryptographic work from about 1944, while holding an academic post in Tokyo.  Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University  In 1949 he travelled to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey at the invitation of Hermann Weyl. He was subsequently also appointed Associate Professor at Princeton University in 1952 and promoted to Professor in 1955. At this time the foundations of Hodge theory were being brought in line with contemporary technique in operator theory. Kodaira rapidly became involved in exploiting the tools it opened up in algebraic geometry, adding sheaf theory as it became available. This work was particularly influential, for example on Friedrich Hirzebruch. In a second research phase, Kodaira wrote a long series of papers in collaboration with Donald C. Spencer, founding the deformation theory of complex structures on manifolds. This gave the possibility of constructions of moduli spaces, since in general such structures depend continuously on parameters. It also identified the sheaf cohomology groups, for the sheaf associated with the holomorphic tangent bundle, that carried the basic data about the dimension of the moduli space, and obstructions to deformations. This theory is still foundational, and also had an influence on the (technically very different) scheme theory of Grothendieck. Spencer then continued this work, applying the techniques to structures other than complex ones, such as G-structures. In a third major part of his work, Kodaira worked again from around 1960 through the classification of algebraic surfaces from the point of view of birational geometry of complex manifolds. This resulted in a typology of seven kinds of two-dimensional compact complex manifolds, recovering the five algebraic types known classically; the other two being non-algebraic. He provided also detailed studies of elliptic fibrations of surfaces over a curve, or in other language elliptic curves over algebraic function fields, a theory whose arithmetic analogue proved important soon afterwards. This work also included a characterisation of K3 surfaces as deformations of quartic surfaces in P4, and the theorem that they form a single diffeomorphism class. Again, this work has proved foundational. (The K3 surfaces were named after Ernst Kummer, Erich K√§hler, and Kodaira). Later years Kodaira left Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study in 1961, and briefly served as chair at the Johns Hopkins University and Stanford University. In 1967, returned to the University of Tokyo. He was awarded a Wolf Prize in 1984/5. He died in Kofu on 26 July 1997. He was honoured with the membership of the Japan Academy, the Mathematical Society of Japan and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. He was the foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1975, member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences in 1974 and honorary member of the London Mathematical Society in 1979. He received the Order of Culture and the Japan Academy Prize in 1957 and the Fujiwara Prize in 1975.

As such, she was also Duchess of Finland (1562‚Äì1583) and Grand Princess of Finland (1581‚Äì1583). Catherine had significant influence over state affairs during the reign of her spouse and negotiated with the pope to introduce a counter-reformation in Sweden.Katarina Jagellonica, urn:sbl:12406, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Birgitta Lager-Kromnow), h√§mtad 2013-12-05. She was the mother of the future Sigismund III Vasa, King of Poland. Early life Catherine Jagiellon was born in Krak√≥w as the youngest daughter of King Sigismund I the Old of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and his wife, Bona Sforza of Milan. Catherine was given a thorough Renaissance education by Italian tutors: she was taught to read, write and speak Latin, German and Italian, instructed in conversation, riding, dancing, singing, and to play several musical instruments.Mattsson, Eva, Furstinnan: en biografi om drottning Katarina Jagellonica, Bring to Life, Vadstena, 2018 After the death of her father in 1548, she and her unmarried sisters Anna and Sophia moved to Masovia with their mother. In 1556, when her sister Sophia married and left for Germany and her mother departed for Italy, Catherine and her sister Anna were moved to the Palace of Vilnius by their brother Sigismund II Augustus of Poland, to ensure a royal presence in Lithuania. Their stay in Vilnius was described as happy, living in a palace and a court strongly influenced by the Italian Renaissance: Catherine and Anna were allowed to compose their own separate households and socialized with the aristocracy. Marriage negotiations Catherine was described as the most beautiful of her sisters, but she was married late for a princess of the era because her family wanted to ensure a marriage of the highest political status for Poland, and the marriages proposed to her demanded long negotiations which ultimately came to nothing. In 1548, she was proposed marriage to both Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and to Duke Albert of Prussia, who both preferred her to her sisters Anna and Sophia: her brother was inclined to the latter, but after long negotiations, the Pope refused a marriage because they were related to each other. Next, she was proposed to by Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria, but her brother, who had himself married a member of the Habsburg dynasty by then, ultimately decided against it. In the 1550s, her brother the king wished an alliance between Poland and Sweden against Russia due to growing tension around Livonia. The religious issue was not considered a serious obstacle by her brother, and the Catholic policy in Poland was by that time still tolerant toward Protestantism. The Polish-Swedish alliance was a wish her brother entertained for several years, and it had in fact been suggested already in 1526, that time between her half-sister Hedwig and King Gustav I of Sweden. In 1555‚Äì56, Sigismund II Augustus suggested to King Gustav I that one of the four Swedish princes, preferably Eric or his brother John, should marry either his sister Anna or Catherine, and he sent pictures of the princesses to the Swedish royal court. Eric was at that time proposing to marry the future queen Elizabeth I of England, however, a proposal he was not willing to give up for several years. There was talk of Catherine to marry John, but Sigismund II Augustus was somewhat reluctant to allow his younger sister to marry before the eldest, Anna, and this created a problem. The negotiations were drawn out, and in 1560, Gustav I died and all negotiations were closed. In August 1560, during the Livonian war, Czar Ivan the Terrible, recently widowed, suggested a marriage between himself and Catherine in order to create peace and settle the difference between Poland and Russia. Her brother viewed the proposal favorably and a Russian delegation visited the Polish court in Vilnius. The Russian envoy reported to Ivan the Terrible that Catherine was beautiful, but that she was crying. Ultimately, Poland and Russia could not agree on the political terms of the marriage and the negotiations were discontinued in January 1561. In July 1561, Sigismund II Augustus suggested to king Eric XIV that his sisters Catherine and Anna should be married to the king's brothers, John and Magnus. Erik XIV gave no definite answer. John was willing to marry Catherine, but not Anna. Sigismund II Augustus was somewhat reluctant to allow his younger sister to marry before his older, which created a problem. Magnus eventually expressed himself willing to marry Anna to enable John to marry Catherine, but the negotiations initially led to nothing and the Swedish king was not willing to take a stand in the issue. In October, John resumed the negotiations of marriage between himself and Catherine on his own initiative and without the consent of Eric XIV, during a time when Sweden under Eric XIV was fighting Poland in the Livonian war. John viewed the Polish king as an important ally and Catherine's Italian inheritance after her mother as important assets in his personal ambitions. Duchess of Finland On 4 October 1562, Catherine was married in the Lower Castle of Vilnius, Lithuania, to Duke John of Finland, the second son of Gustav I and half-brother of the then-reigning King Eric XIV. John had not received his brother's permission for the marriage and there were already tensions between them since John pursued an independent foreign policy. The marriage was conducted in a Catholic ceremony. Catherine brought a large entourage and luxurious possessions, but her inheritance after her mother was actually was never given her. The material dowry she brought with her to Finland however greatly impressed her contemporaries: she brought with her an impressive amount of silver items, among them the first forks used in Finland; hundreds of garments in black, yellow, red and purple satin, silk and velvet, as well as an entourage of Poles, Italians and Germans, among them a Polish cook and an Italian vine master. The couple set up house in Turku Castle in Turku, Finland. Duke John's dealings in Livonia caused King Eric XIV to declare war on his brother. Eric sent 10,000 men to besiege the castle. On 12 August 1563, the castle capitulated; Catherine and John were taken to Sweden and imprisoned in Gripsholm Castle. Catherine the Jagiellonian in prison, by J√≥zef Simmler. Eric offered to allow Catherine to return to Poland, but she chose to accompany John in prison. Tradition claims, that when the king offered Catherine to return to Poland rather than accompany her spouse in prison, she pointed to the inscription in her wedding ring, which said: Nemo nisi mors (\\"Nothing but death [shall separate us]\\"). Catherine was used as a valuable hostage by Eric, but because of her, the imprisonment was lenient. She was personally treated with consideration by king Eric, who allowed her greater freedom than John, such as walking in the area around the castle, and generally granted all requests she made in order to make her imprisonment more comfortable, with exception of everything that had to do with her Catholic religion, such as the access to Catholic priests, which he denied. She asked for the larger part of her entourage to be sent home, only keeping some Polish ladies-in-waiting and her Court dwarf and personal confidante Dorothea Ostrelska. During her incarceration, Catherine gave birth first to her eldest daughter Isabella in 1564 (died 1566), then to her son Sigismund in 1566. In October 1567, John reconciled with Eric, and the couple was released. Catherine and John apparently developed a close relationship during the years of imprisonment. Catherine's unsuccessful suitor Tsar Ivan was in negotiations with Eric in hopes of separating her from John and sending her to marry him in Russia. This caused alarm with Catherine and her relations. In popular opinion, this discussion was one of the reasons for the Swedish people's growing dissatisfaction with the increasingly insane Eric. King Eric agreed to hand over Catherine to Ivan, but the Swedish king was deposed before Catherine could be sent away. As his brother John succeeded him, the problem disappeared.Eriksson 2007, p. 52. Catherine was at Vadstena during the rebellion. Another reason which agitated the nobility against Erik XIV and made them encourage the rebellion of Duke John and his brothers Duke Charles, was the marriage of Erik to the commoner Karin M√•nsdotter, which the nobility regarded as an insult.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Vasadrottningen: en biografi √∂ver Katarina Stenbock 1535-1621 [The Vasa Queen: A biography of Catherine Stenbock, 1535-1621], Historiska media, Lund, 2015 Catherine played some part in the rebellion: she was a friend of one of Erik's enemies, Ebba M√•nsdotter (Lillieh√∂√∂k), who had an influential position within the nobility, and she was also directly approached by Pontus De la Gardie, who appealed to her to persuade the indecisive John to join the rebellion against the King in protest of his scandalous marriage. According to a witness, she answered: \\"Pontus! I have heard your advise and the reasons you present well and good, and they are all very correct and just, but hard to realise. My dear friend, show me the curtsy to allow this to remain between us, and I will speak to my lord and husband.\\" After the fall of Stockholm, she made her entrance to the city in a grand procession on 7 November 1568. Queen consort Catherine's grave monument over John's family crypt in Uppsala Cathedral Catherine's tomb Catherine was crowned queen of Sweden in the spring of 1569. Her relationship with John III continued to be very good during her lifetime, and there are no extramarital partners known on either side. Her ladies-in-waiting was supervised by Karin Gyllenstierna and her Household by chamberlain Pontus De la Gardie, which whom she reportedly had a very good personal relationship (she gave him power of attorney to act as her agent and envoy in Italy regarding her Sforza inheritance). She had her own personal Catholic chapel at court as well as several Catholics in her private Household, among them several Catholic monks and priests, which shocked the Protestants. Despite the controversy around her regarding her role in religious policy, she does not appear to have been subjected to much personal slander. She received many supplicants from both Catholics and Protestants, asking her for charity as well as to act as mediary to the king, and fulfilled these duties as was expected by a contemporary queen consort. Her fervent Protestant brother-in- law, the future Charles IX mentioned her in his propaganda chronicle Hertig Karls rimkr√∂nika, in which he slanders the names of her spouse, son and daughter, but with only mild disapproval toward Catherine, acknowledging her personal qualities: \\"She was a Princess full of virtue and piety, still her faith did come from Rome\\". Queen Catherine had political influence and influenced the monarch within many areas, such as his foreign policy and his interest in renaissance art. It is a revealing fact, that the king's diplomatic contacts with the Catholic powers quickly diminished after her death. Foremost, however, she is known to have influenced John III in his religious policy in favour of Catholicism and the Counter-Reformation, just as the next queen and spouse of John III, Gunilla Bielke, would influence his religious policy in favor of Protestantism. John III named Catherine prospective regent of Sweden during the minority of his son, should he die while his son was a minor.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi √∂ver Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016 Another significant matter of interest was the rights of her son Sigismund to the Polish throne. She brought up both her children in the Catholic faith, which made Sigismund accepted as a Polish monarch. After the death of her childless brother Sigismund II Augustus in 1572, she considered her son to have rights to the Polish throne through her. However, after 1569, Poland had become an elective monarchy. This matter, however, also gave her an international significance. In 1582, she received the former queen, Karin M√•nsdotter, and saw to it that her confiscated jewelry was returned to her. In her final years, Catherine suffered from gout. She fell sick in the spring of 1583, died in Stockholm on 16 September 1583 and was buried in the royal crypt of the Uppsala Cathedral. Religious policy After having become queen, she attracted international attention as a Catholic queen in a Protestant nation, with the position of being able to introduce a counter reformation. In the Papal curia in Rome, she was seen as a Catholic in a heretic surroundings. The same year she became queen, her Polish adviser coadjutor Martin Kromer encouraged her to convert John III to Catholicism. She answered that she was willing, but that the monarch and the public would not accept it. Cardinal Commendone asked her sister, the Polish queen Anna Jagiellon, to support her in her religious-political task, and through Anna, she made contact with the Papal Curia in Rome. A conflict arose between Catherine and Pope Pius V after it became known that she had received the communion \\"sub utraque\\", something which had been banned in the Trident meeting and since then regarded as a sign of heresy. In 1572, she asked for two papal advisers, and was given the Polish Jesuit Johan Herbst as her confessor. From 1572, Queen Catherine was in direct contact with Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius, who declared that he would serve as her support and ally in the work of counter-reformation in Sweden and her messenger to the Pope. In the autumn of 1572, Catherine applied for dispensation to be given the right to receive the communion \\"sub utraque\\", as well as to be given certain dispensations regarding fasting. Her demands are seen as a way for John III to investigate how far the Catholic church would be willing to go to introduce a counter reformation, as certain changes would have to be made to make it possible. John III launched a new church order called \\"R√∂da Boken (\\"The Red Book\\"). This was a form of a mix between Protestantism and Catholicism that reintroduced numerous Catholic customs in the ceremonial life of the Swedish church, one of them being the use of Latin, which aroused a great deal of opposition and resulted in the Liturgical Battle, which was not to end for twenty years. Queen Catherine, Queen Anna, Cardinal Hosius and the pope negotiated for several years about this, and Catherine pointed out, that without certain dispensations for Sweden, a counter-reformation would not be possible. In 1574, she was given absolution and dispensation regarding the fasting, but as the pope refused dispensation regarding the communion, she refused to take communion altogether. Her agent in Rome was Paolo Ferrari. The papal curia had serious hopes for a counter-reformation in Sweden through her. In 1574, she received the Polish Jesuit Stanislaus Warszewicki, sent to her to as an ambassador from the pope and king Philip II of Spain. Queen Catherine had the son of the deposed Eric XIV sent to the Jesuit order in Poland in 1573. In 1575, the ban for the remaining convents in Sweden to accept novices was lifted. In 1576, she sent her son to be educated by the Jesuits in Braunsberg. She welcomed the Norwegian Jesuit Laurentius Nicolai from Rome and housed him in the former Franciscan monastery in Stockholm, that had been closed during the Reformation, and allowed him to open a Catholic school there (the Protestants stormed and closed the school in 1583). Queen Catherine strongly supported the old Vadstena Abbey, where the last nuns still lived, and often visited it. A new shrine was made for the relics of King Eric the Saint in the cathedral of Uppsala. The Counter-reformatory efforts contributed to tension in connection to the imprisoned Erik XIV, who came to be a symbol of Protestantism in prison. During the imprisonment of Eric, three major conspiracies were made to depose John III: the 1569 Plot, the Mornay Plot and the 1576 Plot, among whom at least the last one was heavily influenced by religious considerations. Mauritz Rasmusson, urn:sbl:9197, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars Ericson), h√§mtad 2020-08-03. Sforza inheritance Catherine and John III were both eager to be given possession of her part of the Sforza inheritance after her mother in Italy. Queen Catherine had her own personal ambassadors in Rome to protect her interests, Petrus Rosinus and Ture Bielke. The papal curia was willing to help them in this issue, but as her inheritance was situated in the Kingdom of Naples, then belonging to Spain, the pope did not succeed. During the reign of King Stephen B√°thory in Poland, the relation between Sweden and Poland, which affected Catherine's power position in Sweden and placed her in a difficult situation. In 1578-79 and 1579‚Äì80, she received the papal ambassador Antonio Possevino. He had been given the task to provide Catherine with her Sforza inheritance, mediate between Poland and Sweden and convert John III. He failed on all accounts. He did, however, confirm the marriage between the royal couple, which had been dubious in Rome, as it had lacked the dispensation which was necessary for Rome to consider a marriage between a Catholic and a Protestant as valid. In 1582, Catherine received the Polish ambassador Alamanni and explained that she was not in a position to convince John to make peace with Poland. At her next audience with the ambassador, she received him in the presence of her children Sigismund and Anna and stated that Poland seldom had seen to her interests. Legacy The infusion of Polish blood into the Swedish royal lineage that began with Catherine would cause considerable strife after her death in the context of the ongoing European wars of religion. Her son Sigismund inherited the thrones of both the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (in 1587) and Sweden (in 1592), but ruled the latter only seven years before being deposed in 1599. Sigismund and his descendants, as Catholic kings, would continue to lay claim to de facto Protestant Sweden over the following century. The succession dispute contributed to the outbreak of several destructive wars until a massive Swedish invasion in the 1650s (known as the Deluge) nearly broke up the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Polish claims to the Swedish throne were finally relinquished in the 1660 Treaty of Oliva. The image of Catherine Jagiellon enjoyed a resurgence in the 19th and 20th centuries Finnish culture and art. John and Catherine were the only Swedish monarchs to reside in the Finnish part of the Swedish realm for any length of time, and their alleged fondness for the land inspired Finnish nationalists. The religious issues that made Catherine unpopular with her contemporaries were by then long obsolete, and it has instead become traditional to depict her as a compassionate and loyal queen. The first version of the later famous royal palace of Drottningholm (The Queen's Islet) was founded for and named after her.

It was in this house and garden that Darwin worked on his theories of evolution by natural selection which he had conceived in London before moving to Down. The Grade I listed building stands in Luxted Road south of Downe, a village south east of London's Charing Cross, which was still known as Down when he moved there in 1842. In Darwin's day, Downe was a parish in Kent: it subsequently came under Bromley Rural District, and since 1965 has lain within the London Borough of Bromley. The house, garden and grounds are in the guardianship of English Heritage, have been restored and are open to the public.  History of Down House  In 1651 Thomas Manning sold a parcel of land including most of the current property to John Know the elder, from a Kentish yeoman family, for ¬£345 (equivalent to ¬£ in present-day terms). It has been debated whether this price is likely to have included a house, but, if not, it was Know who built the first farmhouse on the property: some surviving flint walls may date from this period. In 1653 John Know gave the house to his son Roger, probably as a wedding present; and in 1743 the marriage of Mary Know passed the property to the family of Bartholomew of West Peckham in the Weald. In 1751 Leonard Bartholomew sold the uninhabited house on to Charles Hayes of Hatton Garden.Atkins 1976, pp. 16‚Äì17. The property was acquired by the businessman and landowner George Butler in 1778, and it is thought that he rebuilt and enlarged the house: in 1781 he paid the highest window tax in the village. Around this time it was apparently called the Great House. After Butler died in 1783 the property changed hands several times, then in 1819 it went to Lieut.-Col. John Johnson, C.B., colonel of engineers in the Hon. East India Company, Bombay establishment. In 1837 Johnson migrated to \\"Lake Erie near Dunville in Upper Canada\\", and passed what was now called Down House on to the incumbent parson of the parish, the Rev. James Drummond. The house was re-roofed and brought into good order under the supervision of Edward Cresy, an architect who lived nearby. Around 1840 Drummond left the property vacant and put it up for auction, but it was unsold and lay empty for two years.  1842‚Äì1906: Darwins at Down  The Darwin family in 1841 was finding their London house increasingly cramped: both Charles and his wife Emma preferred living in the countryside, as they were disturbed by the constant noise and severe coal smoke air pollution of central London, and they had two young children, William (b. 1839) and Anne (b. 1841). Darwin approached his father Robert Darwin for financing, and with the caution that he should try living in an area for some time before being committed to a move, was given approval to start house hunting. Charles and Emma sought somewhere about from London with railway access, such as Windsor, Berkshire, and came close to buying one near Chobham, Surrey. On Friday 22 July 1842, Charles and Emma visited Down House. They slept at \\"a little pot-house\\" in the village, which was also \\"a grocers- shop & the land-lord is the carpenter\\", and returned to London on Saturday afternoon, then on the Sunday Darwin wrote to tell his sister of their first impressions. Though there were plenty of trains on the line from London to the nearest station, from there it was a long, slow and hilly drive to Downe. The small quiet village was away from main roads, and though local scenery was beautiful on a good day, the house \\"being situated on rather high table-land, has somewhat of desolate air ... The charm of the place to me is that almost every field is intersected (as alas is our's) by one or more foot-paths‚Äî I never saw so many walks in any other country\\". The three-storey house itself stood \\"very badly close to a tiny lane & near another man's field\\", and was \\"ugly, looks neither old nor new\\" but on the ground floor it had a \\"Capital study\\" and a dining room facing east, and a large drawing room facing west, with plenty of bedrooms upstairs. Darwin believed that the price was about ¬£2,200 (equivalent to ¬£ in present-day terms) and he could lease it for one year to try it out. That Friday was cold and gloomy, and Emma was at first disappointed with the \\"desolate\\" scenery as well as being \\"dreadfully bad with toothache, headache\\", that evening, but liked the house and grounds better than Charles, finding it \\"not too near or too far from other houses\\". On the Saturday the weather changed, and \\"she was so delighted with the scenery for the first few miles from Down, that it has worked great change in her\\".Atkins 1976, pp. 20‚Äì21. Charles Darwin's study at Down House, restored with original furniture including his wheeled armchair and writing board. On the right, two (shuttered) windows look east, and Darwin had an angled mirror fixed outside to see who was coming up the drive to the entrance. The house had obvious faults, but they were both weary of house-hunting, and it was cheap. Emma preferred a more expensive house in Surrey, and may have hoped that Darwin's father would increase the loan, but life in crowded dirty London was becoming more unpleasant and she was pregnant so unable to continue the search that year. With advice from the architect and surveyor Edward Cresy, Darwin opened negotiations, but the Rev. James Drummond refused to lease the property and wanted ¬£2,500 to pay off his mortgage on it. Cresy suggested a bid of ¬£2,100, but Darwin remembered an unsuccessful earlier attempt at purchase, and made an offer of about ¬£2,200 which was accepted. At the end of August they were almost ready to move, and Emma moved in on 14 September 1842, followed by Charles three days later. Emma gave birth to Mary Eleanor on 23 September, and they were all getting on well ‚Äì even Darwin's brother Erasmus who had said the place should be called \\"Down-in-the-Mouth\\" had altered his opinion, but they were saddened when baby Mary died on 16 October. alt=The west front of Down House looks out onto its gardens, and the main block is dominated by the angled walls of the bay extension Darwin had built in 1843. The kitchen wing to the right has a classroom on the upper floor, and the block to the left, added in 1858, has a drawing room behind the glazed roofed verandah. Darwin made extensive alterations to the house and grounds. An angled bay forming a large bow front extending up through all three storeys at the west elevation of the house extended the drawing room and rooms over it, giving improved views and lighting: Darwin wrote telling his cousin that the first brick was laid on 27 March 1843. By 27 April, work was in hand to lower the lane by as much as and build new flint boundary walls, which together with earth mounds and shrubbery made the east garden more private. A strip of the field was made into a kitchen garden including the experimental plot of ground, and later the greenhouses. In September 1843, the Darwin family increased with the birth of \\"Etty\\" in the house, where all their remaining children were born: George in 1845, \\"Bessy\\" in 1847, Francis in 1848, Leonard in 1850, Horace in 1851, and their 10th child Charles Waring Darwin who was born in 1856, but died in 1858. Between 1845 and 1846, Darwin altered the service wing to the south of the main block, getting the kitchen area rebuilt with the addition of a butler's pantry, and a schoolroom and two small bedrooms on upper floors. The outhouses were rebuilt, and a mound to the west side was removed with a new mound being added to the east to give protection from the wind. On their first visit Darwin had noted that \\"The great Astronomer Sir J. Lubbock is owner of 3000 acres [12 km2] here, & is building a grand house a mile off\\", but thought that he would be too reserved or proud to visit them. In fact, Sir John William Lubbock had brought home a \\"great piece of news\\", and while his son was initially disappointed that the news was just that Darwin was coming to Down House and not a new pony, young John Lubbock soon became close friends with Darwin and a frequent visitor to Down House. The sandwalk, Darwin's thinking path. In 1846, Darwin rented from Sir John William Lubbock a narrow strip of land of adjoining the Down House grounds to the southwest, and had it planted. He named it the Sandwalk Wood. One side was shaded by an old shaw with oak trees, and the other looked over a hedge to a charming valley. Darwin had a variety of trees planted, and ordered a gravel path known as the \\"sandwalk\\" to be created around the perimeter. Darwin's daily walk of several circuits of this path served both for exercise and for uninterrupted thinking. He set up a number of small stones at one point on the walk so that he could kick a stone to the side each time he passed, so that he did not have to interrupt his thoughts by consciously counting the number of circuits he had made that day. The sandwalk also served as a playground for his children. A wooden summerhouse was built at the lower end of the sandwalk. In 1874, Darwin gave a piece of pasture land to Sir John Lubbock (the son) in exchange for ownership of the Sandwalk Wood. From 1849 Darwin used it to continue his walking exercise on return from Dr. Gully's hydrotherapy treatment. A new extension at the north end of the house was added in 1858, providing a large new drawing room facing west which became a comfortable family room, and two bedrooms over. The former drawing room was converted into a new dining room, and the old dining room next to the kitchen became a billiard room. Darwin's greenhouse at Down House where he conducted many experiments Darwin's interest in the fertilisation of orchids led him to get a new heated greenhouse constructed under the supervision of John Horwood, the gardener of Mr Turnbull at The Rookery: this was completed in February 1863. It includes a tunnel passageway that allows bees to fly in and out. In 1872, a verandah was added to the west side of the new drawing room, and in 1877 a new billiard room was added to the east of this block, with the hallway being extended to form a new entrance hall and Georgian-style porch facing east. The new billiard room was converted to a new study in 1881, and the old study where Darwin wrote On the Origin of Species was converted into a smoking room. In the same year Darwin bought a strip of land to the north of the property, beyond his orchard, and had a hard tennis court and a new wall built. After the death of Frank's first wife Amy, their son Bernard Darwin was brought up by Charles and Emma at Down. Charles Darwin died at the house on 19 April 1882, aged 73. Emma also died there in 1896. In February 1897, the house was advertised to be let, furnished, at a rent of \\"12 guineas per week, including gardeners\\". From 1900 to 1906, George Darwin rented the house out to a Mr Whitehead, who was the first owner of a motor car in Downe.  1907‚Äì1922: Downe School for Girls A girls' boarding school was established at the house in February 1907, co- founded by the headmistress Olive Willis (1877‚Äì1964) with her friend Alice Carver. The school began with five mistresses and one girl, but was soon successful and grew to around 60 pupils.Atkins 1976, pp. 106‚Äì10. Various corrugated iron outbuildings were erected around the house at this time, to serve as the school's chapel, gymnasium, music-rooms and lavatories: these were later removed.Bowen 1950, pp. 185, 194. The school occupied the house until 1 April 1922, when it moved to larger premises at Hermitage Rd, Cold Ash, Newbury, where it remains. The present school is still named Downe House School, and one of its houses is still named Darwin. The novelist Elizabeth Bowen, who was a pupil at the school during the First World War, wrote after revisiting Down House in the 1930s: \\"I have never liked scientific people very much, and it mortifies me to think of them trampling reverently around there on visiting days, thinking of Charles Darwin and ignorant of my own youth.\\"Bowen 1950, p. 194.  1927‚Äì1996: Darwin Museum Down House today as a museum. From 1924, another girls' school was run in the house by a Miss Rain, but this was unsuccessful and closed in 1927. Following an appeal at that year's Annual Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science by its president Sir Arthur Keith, the surgeon Sir George Buckston Browne (1850‚Äì1945) bought Down from the Darwin heirs for ¬£4,250 in 1927 (equivalent to ¬£ in present-day terms). He spent about ¬£10,000 on repairs and on 7 January 1929 presented it to the British Association together with an endowment of ¬£20,000 to ensure its preservation in perpetuity as a memorial to Darwin, to be used for the benefit of science and open to visitors free of charge. Down House was formally opened to the public as a museum at a tea on 7 June 1929. In 1931, Buckston Browne gave the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) an endowment fund and land adjacent to the Down House property to establish the Buckston Browne Research Farm, a surgical research station.British Association for the Advancement of Science: Historical and descriptive catalogue of the Darwin Memorial at Down House (35 pp.) (c. 1946?) pp. 5‚Äì8 For his efforts in saving the historic house, Buckston Browne received a knighthood in the 1932 New Year Honours. Buckston Browne's endowment for the house proved insufficient and the expense of maintenance led to the British Association in turn donating the house to the RCS in October 1953. In 1962, Sir Hedley Atkins (1905‚Äì1983), later President of the RCS, moved into the house together with his wife and assumed the role of honorary curator. In May 1954, Down House itself was designated as a Grade I listed building, and in September 1988 the garden and Sandwalk were added to the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England at Grade II.  1996 to present: restored house and garden  Down House was acquired in 1996 by English Heritage, with a grant from the Wellcome Trust. It was restored with funds raised by the Natural History Museum from many trusts, and from a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and reopened to the public in April 1998. In 2009, the Darwin Bicentenary Project created a new exhibition on the first floor of the house, telling the story of Darwin's life and work.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/festivalsandevents/4592579/Charles- Darwin-anniversary-Down-House-Kent.html A video guide outside focuses on how Darwin used his garden as an outdoor laboratory and features clips from David Attenborough, Professor Steve Jones and Melvyn Bragg. Darwin's notebooks were digitised using Turning the Pages software and put online.http://www.london- footprints.co.uk/peodarwin.htm Down House and the surrounding area has been nominated by the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to become a World Heritage Site. It originally went through public consultation in 2006 and a decision had been expected in the last three days of June 2007. However, ICOMOS warned the DCMS that the House might not meet the criteria for scientific sites on the register, and so in May 2007 the DCMS announced that it was withdrawing the bid with the intention of resubmitting it later. The bid was resubmitted unsuccessfully in January 2009. The master bedroom was restored, and opened to the public for the first time in June 2016. The restoration included a reconstruction of the Darwins' collection of fine art prints, with Biblical scenes by Raphael, Titian and Sebastiano del Piombo as well as a Raphael self-portrait in the bedroom, and a self-portrait by Leonardo da Vinci in Darwin's study together with portraits of Charles Lyell and Erasmus Darwin. Visiting Down House, its garden and grounds are open to the public and English Heritage members. It is open daily from April to the end of October, and on weekends only from November until the end of March. The house and garden undergoes routine conservation work during its closed periods. The house can be reached by public transport from central London, as it is located within Transport for London travel Zone 6. The 146 bus service from Bromley North railway station (daily) terminates nearby at Downe Village, and the R8 bus from Orpington railway station (excluding Sundays) stops on request outside Down House. The closest Tramlink station is New Addington.

The Westbury or Bratton White Horse is a hill figure on the escarpment of Salisbury Plain, approximately east of Westbury in Wiltshire, England. Located on the edge of Bratton Downs and lying just below an Iron Age hill fort, it is the oldest of several white horses carved in Wiltshire.The Westbury or Bratton white horse It was restored in 1778, an action which may have obliterated another horse that had occupied the same slope. A contemporary engraving from the 1760s appears to show a horse facing in the opposite direction that was rather smaller than the present figure. There is, however, no documentation or other evidence for the existence of a chalk horse at Westbury before 1742. The horse is tall and wide and has been adopted as a symbol for the town of Westbury, appearing on welcome signs and the logo of its tourist information centre. It is also considered a symbol for Wiltshire as a whole. Origins Flag of the Electorate of Hanover, which may have inspired the Westbury White Horse soon after the Hanoverian dynasty inherited the British throne. Although it is the oldest of the Wiltshire white horses, the origin of the Westbury White Horse is obscure. It is often claimed to commemorate King Alfred's victory at the Battle of Ethandun in 878, and while this is not impossible, there is no trace of such a legend before the second half of the 18th century. Since the late 19th century historians have mostly located the battle of Ethandun at Edington in Wiltshire, some away from the white horse, but this theory is still open to debate. Another hillside chalk figure, the Uffington White Horse, featured in King Alfred's early life. He was born in the Vale of White Horse, not far from Uffington in Oxfordshire. Unlike the recorded history of Westbury, documents as early as the eleventh century refer to the \\"White Horse Hill\\" at Uffington (\\"mons albi equi\\"), and archaeological work has dated the Uffington White Horse to the Bronze Age, although it is not certain that it was originally intended to represent a horse. A white horse war standard was associated with the continental Saxons in the Dark Ages, and the figures of Hengest and Horsa who, according to legend, led the first Anglo-Saxon invaders into England, are said to have fought under a white horse standard (a claim recalled in the heraldic badge of the county of Kent). During the 18th century, the white horse was a heraldic symbol associated with the new British Royal Family, the House of Hanover, and it is argued by some scholars that the Westbury White Horse may have first been carved in the early 18th century as a symbol of loyalty to the new Protestant reigning house. In Alfred and the Great White Horse of Wiltshire (1939), the Downside Abbey monk Dom Illtyd Trethowan debunked the suggested connection of the White Horse with Alfred and the Battle of Ethandune.Illtyd Trethowan, 'Alfred and the Great White Horse of Wiltshire', in Downside Review vol. LVII (1939) Paul Newman suggests in his book Lost Gods of Albion (2009) that the horse may have been inspired by the popularity of folly buildings in the 18th century. Wiltshire folklore has it that when the nearby Bratton church clock strikes midnight, the white horse goes down to the Bridewell Springs,Bridewell is pronounced locally as if it is spelt \\"Briddle\\", and as such, the springs are also known as the Briddle Springs. below the hill, to drink.  Modern history  The horse by Eric Ravilious, 1939 By 1872 the horse was considered to have lost shape, by the chalk repeatedly growing over and being recut. In 1873 it was remodelled by a committee, and at the same time substantial edging-stones were added all around the perimeter, to prevent the shape from changing again.The Westbury or Bratton white horse at wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk, accessed 10 October 2016 The horse was illuminated at night in 1900 and again in 1950, both times using army equipment. For the 1950 event, traffic in Westbury and Bratton came almost to a standstill as drivers slowed down to look.Wiltshire White Horses: lighting up the horses at wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk, accessed 10 October 2016 In the 1950s the horse was concreted over by Westbury Urban District Council, apparently as a way to save on long-term maintenance costs. Since then, the concrete has greyed over time, and it was thoroughly cleaned in 1993. In 2003, the horse was vandalised when \\"Stop This War\\" was written in yellow across the horse in capital letters in protest of the Iraq War. After the words were removed, the horse was noticeably grey with a white horizontal strip where the message had been. In November 2006, the horse was repainted and the 1950s damage was fully repaired, as was the white strip. The newly whitened horse was illuminated for a third time on the night the repairs were finished, this time by Second World War searchlights. In July 2010, the neck of the horse was vandalised when the word \\"wonkey\\" was written across it. This part of the neck had to be rewhitened in 2010, leading to the horse having a whiter neck than the rest of the body. The BBC reported that the horse was to be cleaned again in 2012. Work began on 11 April 2012 and was completed on 19 April 2012. The cleaning coincided with the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Celebrating the completion of the work, again the horse was lit up with searchlights. Since the annual Village Pump Festival moved from Farleigh Hungerford to the White Horse Country Park beneath the horse in 2012, the horse has been illuminated at night whilst the festival has been taking place. This is achieved via a tinted spotlight which changes colour every couple of seconds, so the horse appears different colours. Two visitor information signs, on the hill above the horse and in the Viewing Area car park, were placed in 1999 following the completion of Devizes White Horse; the signs show all eight Wiltshire White Horses. Also on the side of the hill is a toposcope dated 1968, mounted on a small stone structure, which identifies the towns and cities that can be seen from the hillside. For the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, a fire beacon was placed to the side of the road on the top of the hill leading to the car park on 3 June 2002, that resembles the millennium beacons. It is lit sporadically, and was lit for the 70th anniversary of VE Day on 8 May 2015. BBC News had a video in June 2018 showing the horse being cleaned with high pressure water jets by up to 18 volunteer abseilers. The cost was given as ¬£3,000, paid for by Westbury Town Council. It stated that the previous clean was in 2016.  Views  The Horse can be viewed from up to in all directions. From the horse, Westbury and Trowbridge can be closely observed. The Mendip TV Mast on the Mendip Hills in Somerset can be seen clearly to the west, particularly at night. From the top of the horse and Bratton Castle, Devizes White Horse and Alton Barnes White Horse can both be viewed. The horse itself cannot be seen from other hill figures. Two of the furthest views of the horse are said to be from Beckford's Tower in Bath and from the tower of St Michael's Church, Dundry near Bristol. A car park on Bratton Road on the B3098 which passes beneath the horse is known as Westbury White Horse Viewing Area. It has fifteen parking spaces and information boards on the horse. In 1961 a chimney was built at the Blue Circle cement works about a mile and a half away from the horse. The Blue Circle company was bought in 2001 by Lafarge and the chimney was last used in 2010: it was demolished on 18 September 2016. Some considered it an eyesore whilst others considered it a local icon, a debate covered by a BBC Wiltshire radio broadcast in 2011. Many further views of the horse also included the chimney and the chimney was the most prominent feature of the view from the horse; some considered the chimney to spoil views from the hill. As the horse has been vandalised several times, so too the chimney was defaced in 2010 by the addition of a Union Jack flag. The landscape of the horse was threatened in 2013 when Wiltshire Council revealed plans for a potential three-lane bypass that would run within half a mile of the horse, with a business park and 550 new homes on Green Belt land. Some local residents, together with many from outside the town, were against the \\"Swindonisation\\" of their corner of West Wiltshire, although many residents felt that Westbury, as the only town on the A350 without a bypass and whose medieval heart was blighted by pollution and HGVs needed a bypass.  Battle of Ethandun Memorial  Battle of Ethandun Memorial Although the horse is only presumed to commemorate King Alfred's victory at the Battle of Ethandun, an official monument to the victory was erected atop the hill, adjacent to Bratton Camp. The monument does not have an official name but is known as the Battle of Ethandun Memorial. It consists of a large sarsen stone (stone of remembrance) with a \\"pebbled\\" base, on which lies a metal commemorative plaque. The monument was unveiled 5 November 2000 by the 7th Marquess of Bath. King Alfred's Tower, near Stourhead, is the best known monument that was definitely built to celebrate King Alfred and his victory. The folly tower was erected in 1772, six years before the white horse was redesigned.  In popular culture  The Edward Street mosaic. The White Horse was referenced in the books The Tontine (1955) by Thomas B. Costain, The Emigrants (1980) by Caribbean author George Lamming, and in the novel The English Patient (1992) by Michael Ondaatje, as the place where the sapper Kip learned how to deactivate bombs. Michael Morpurgo mentioned it as one of the inspirations for The Butterfly Lion. The figure can be seen in the music video for Scottish guitarist Midge Ure's 1996 single \\"Breathe\\", and is featured in the current opening titles of the regional television news programme ITV News West Country. Furthermore, it featured in a 2015 Visit England tourist advertisement produced in association with the England rugby team. The horse lends its name to White Horse Business Park outside Trowbridge and White Horse Country Park outside Westbury. The horse overlooks both parks. White Horse Way is also a name of a street in Westbury, and the town's visitor centre features the horse in its logo, as does its golf club. The horse was depicted by artist Eric Ravilious (1903‚Äì1942) in his watercolour paintings \\"Train Landscape\\" and \\"The Westbury Horse\\" 1939.

Examples include pottery embellished with imitation rivets reminiscent of similar pots made of metal and a software calendar that imitates the appearance of binding on a paper desk calendar. Pieces from a Vienna porcelain tea service imitating prints and wood  Definition and purpose  The term skeuomorph is compounded from skeuos (œÉŒ∫Œµ·ø¶ŒøœÇ), meaning \\"container or tool\\", and morph·∏ó (ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒÆ), meaning \\"shape\\". It has been applied to material objects since 1890 and is now also used to describe computer and mobile interfaces. A similar alternative definition of skeuomorph is \\"a physical ornament or design on an object made to resemble another material or technique\\". This definition is broader in scope, as it can be applied to design elements that still serve the same function as they did in a previous design. Skeuomorphs may be deliberately employed to make a new look more familiar and comfortable, or may be the result of cultural influences and norms on the designer. They may be artistic expression on the part of the designer. The usability researcher and academic Don Norman describes skeuomorphism in terms of cultural constraints: interactions with a system that are learned only through culture. Norman also popularized perceived affordances, where the user can tell what an object provides or does based on its appearance, which skeuomorphism can make easy. The concept of skeuomorphism overlaps with other design concepts. Mimesis is an imitation, coming directly from the Greek word. Archetype is the original idea or model that is emulated, where the emulations can be skeuomorphic. Skeuomorphism is parallel to, but different from, path dependence in technology, where an element's functional behavior is maintained even when the original reasons for its design no longer exist.  Physical examples Triglyph and guttae in the Doric order; traditionally seen as recreating in stone functional features of the wooden Greek temples that preceded them. Many features of wooden buildings were repeated in stone by the Ancient Greeks when they transitioned from wood to masonry construction. Decorative stone features in the Doric order of classical architecture in Greek temples such as triglyphs, mutules, guttae, and modillions are supposed to be derived from true structural and functional features of the early wooden temples. The triglyph and guttae are seen as recreating in stone functional features of the wooden temples that preceded them, respectively the carved beam-ends and six wooden pegs driven in to secure the beam in place.Summerson, John, The Classical Language of Architecture, pp. 128, 133, 1980 edition, Thames and Hudson World of Art series, Historically, high-status items such as the Minoans' elaborate and expensive silver cups were recreated for a wider market using pottery, a cheaper material. The exchange of shapes between metalwork and ceramics, often from the former to the latter, is near-constant in the history of the decorative arts. Sometimes pellets of clay are used to evoke the rivets of the metal originals. There is also evidence of skeuomorphism in material transitions. Leather and pottery often carry over features from the wooden counterparts of previous generations. Clay pottery has also been found bearing rope-shaped protrusions, pointing to craftsmen seeking familiar shapes and processes while working with new materials. In this context, skeuomorphs exist as traits sought in other objects, either for their social desirability or psychological comforts. In the modern era, cheaper plastic items often attempt to mimic more expensive wooden and metal products, though they are only skeuomorphic if new ornamentation references the original functionality, such as molded screw heads in molded plastic items. Another well-known skeuomorph is the plastic Adirondack chair. The lever on a mechanical slot machine, or \\"one-armed bandit,\\" is a skeuomorphic throwback feature when it appears on a modern video slot machine, since it is no longer required to set physical mechanisms and gears into motion. Articles of clothing are also given skeuomorphic treatment; for example, faux buckles on certain strap shoes, such as Mary Janes for small children, which permit the retention of the original aesthetic. Automotive design has historically been full of physical skeuomorphisms, such as thinly chrome-plated plastic components and imitation leather, gold, wood, pearl, or crystal jeweled elements. In the 1970s, opera windows and vinyl roofs on many luxury sedan cars imitated carriage work from the horse and buggy era. , most electric cars feature prominent front grilles, even though there is little need for intake of air to cool an absent internal combustion engine.  Virtual examples Skeuomorph in user interface (hardware-like user interface) with emulating control knobs for manipulating digital audio in the Redstair GEARcompressor Audio Unit-Plugin. Many computer programs have a skeuomorphic graphical user interface that emulates the aesthetics of physical objects. Examples include a digital contact list resembling a Rolodex, and IBM's 1998 RealThings package. A more extreme example is found in some music synthesis and audio processing software packages, which closely emulate physical musical instruments and audio equipment complete with buttons and dials. On a smaller scale, the icons of GUIs may remain skeuomorphic representations of physical objects that are no longer directly applicable to the task they represent (such as a drawing of a floppy disk to represent \\"save\\"). Apple Inc., while under the direction of Steve Jobs, was known for its wide usage of skeuomorphic designs in various applications. This changed after Jobs' death when Scott Forstall, described as \\"the most vocal and high-ranking proponent of the visual design style favored by Mr. Jobs\\", resigned. Apple designer Jonathan Ive took over some of Forstall's responsibilities and had \\"made his distaste for the visual ornamentation in Apple's mobile software known within the company\\". With the announcement of iOS 7 at WWDC in 2013, Apple officially shifted from skeuomorphism to a more simplified design, thus beginning the so-called \\"death of skeuomorphism\\" at Apple. Other virtual skeuomorphs do not employ literal images of some physical object; but rather allude to ritual human heuristics or heuristic motifs, such as slider bars that emulate linear potentiometers and visual tabs that behave like physical tabbed file folders. Another example is the swiping hand gesture for turning the \\"pages\\" or screens of a tablet display. Virtual skeuomorphs can also be auditory. The shutter-click sound emitted by most camera phones when taking a picture is an auditory skeuomorph, though it has also been deemed necessary for legal reasons especially due to voyeurism and child predator concerns.  In design  Pushbutton telephone with imitation rotary dial Retrofuturism incorporates spatial motifs from previous iterations of the future; especially visions of electro- industrialism. This is frequently incorporated in retrowave or synthwave illustrations. Skeumorphic time is closely linked with metamodernism. Skeuomorphic design seems to be preferred by older recipient groups often referred to as digital immigrants while digital natives tend to favor flat design over skeuomorphisms. However, younger people are still able to understand the signifiers that skeuomorphic design employs. A better user experience could be measured for each respective design philosophy among digital natives and immigrants. Although it is often proven that digital immigrants are more likely able to perceive and understand all available functions in an application, it has been found out that some affordances that do not have direct signifiers e.g. the function to flip pages in an ebook by simple swiping from right to left are less likely to be found by older users. However, all associated Functions should be included when a certain metaphor is used. For example users are likely to feel frustrated when trying to pull a file into the trash bin only to find out that this gesture does not delete the file.  Arguments in favor  An argument in favor of skeuomorphic design is that it makes it easier for those familiar with the original device to use the digital emulation by making certain signifiers to affordances stronger. Interactions with computer devices are mostly cultural and learned. Once a process is learned and adopted in a society, it develops persistence. Proposals for change, especially radical change, often result in debate between proponents and opponents. Don Norman describes this process as a form of cultural heritage. Compared to flat design, skeuomorphic design seems to facilitate a fast navigation through graphic user interfaces, supposedly because icons are more easily recognized and less abstract than their minimalistic counterparts found in flat design.  Arguments against  The arguments against virtual skeuomorphic design are that skeuomorphic interface elements use metaphors that are more difficult to operate and take up more screen space than standard interface elements, that this breaks operating system interface design standards, that it causes an inconsistent look and feel between applications, that skeuomorphic interface elements rarely incorporate numeric input or feedback for accurately setting a value, that many users may have no experience with the original device being emulated, that skeuomorphic design can increase cognitive load with visual noise that after a few uses gives little or no value to the user, that skeuomorphic design limits creativity by grounding the experience to physical counterparts, and that skeuomorphic designs often do not accurately represent underlying system state or data types due to inappropriate mimesis, such as analog gauges in a digital interface. In the case of an electric tea kettle, such designs can be dangerous. If it is used in the manner of the original tea kettles, catastrophe can ensue if user places it on active fire, resulting in property damage or injury.

Etymology The word is derived from Turkish ka√ßmak for \\"outlaw\\". Background History 1920‚Äì24 Kachak movement The Committee for the National Defense of Kosovo () was created in Shkod√´r, under Hasan Prishtina, in 1918. The committee organizationally and financially supported the kachaks in Albanian-populated areas of Yugoslavia, in Kosovo and Skopje (the former Kosovo Vilayet). Kachaks were also active around Ohrid and Bitola. On 6 May 1919 the Committee called for a general uprising in Kosovo and other Albanian-inhabited regions in Yugoslavia. The Kachaks were popular among Albanians, and local support to them increased in the 1920s when Hasan Prishtina became a member of the Albanian parliament, Hoxhe Kadriu became Minister of justice, and Bajram Curri became Minister of war (1921). All three were Kosovar Albanians. During this time, Kosovar Albanians under Azem Galica began an armed struggle, also known as the \\"Kachak movement\\", a large-scale revolt in Drenica involving around 10,000 people under Galica. The uprising was quelled by the Yugoslav army. Armed conflicts between the Yugoslav army and the Kachaks took place in the years 1920 and 1921, 1923, with a revival in 1924. One of the achievements was the creation of the \\"neutral zone\\" around Junik which would serve for jeopardizing the frontier and providing ammunition and other logistical support for the Kachaks.

Early life and military career Georges Marie Ludovic Jules Guynemer was born in Compi√®gne to a wealthy and aristocratic family. His father was Paul Guynemer. His mother was Julie, Countess of Saint-Quentin. He experienced an often sickly childhood. Nevertheless, he succeeded as an aviator through his enormous drive and self-confidence. He was originally rejected five times for military service due to frailty, but was accepted for training as a mechanic in late 1914. With determination, he gained acceptance to pilot training, joining Escadrille MS.3 on 8 June 1915. He remained in the same unit for his entire service.Georges Guynemer ‚Äì The Most Brilliant Stork The first plane allocated to him was a Morane-Saulnier L monoplane previously flown by Charles Bonnard, and accordingly named Vieux Charles (Old Charles). Guynemer kept the name and continued to use it for most of his later aircraft. On 19 July 1915, he shot down his first plane, a German Aviatik. On 5 December 1915, the Escadrille MS.3 was renamed the Escadrille N.3, after being re-equipped with new Nieuport 10 fighters. Flying the more effective plane, Guynemer quickly established himself as one of France's premier fighter pilots. He became an ace, with his fifth victory coming in February 1916, and was promoted to lieutenant in March. On 12 March 1916 he scored his 8th victory.See Guynemer's 8th victory..articleAt the end of the year, his score had risen to 25.\\"on November 10 1916 Guynemer shot down an Aviatak of Jasta 6 and then a Albatros CV of FA 59\\" Capitaine Brocard, commander of Escadrille N.3 (Storks), described Guynemer at that time as \\"...my most brilliant Stork.\\" Less than a year later, Guynemer was promoted to captain and commander of the Storks squadron. Georges Guynemer's original SPAD S.VII, nicknamed \\"Vieux Charles\\", preserved at Mus√©e de l'Air et de l'Espace. Georges Guynemer in 1917 Guynemer became influential enough to affect French fighter aircraft design. In December 1916, he wrote a letter to the chief designer at Spad, criticizing the Spad VII as inferior to the German Halberstadt that was its contemporary. As a consequence, Spad developed two new but very similar models, the SPAD XII and SPAD XIII. The new models were promising, but had teething problems with the reduction gear between engine and propeller.

It was also armed with a air-cooled Vickers machine gun. Although the cannon promised devastating firepower, the new plane was a handful because of it, as the cannon's rearwards-protruding breech mandated separate aileron and elevator controls, split from each other on opposing sides of the cockpit. The single shot cannon had to be manually reloaded in flight; it had a heavy recoil when fired, and filled the canopy with fumes from every shot. The Spad XII was not a plane for a novice pilot.

Death Guynemer's aircraft memorial statue in commemoration of Georges Guynemer in the heart of Poelkapelle Guynemer failed to return from a combat mission on 11 September 1917. The previous week had been one of mechanical ills, in both his assigned aircraft and the ones he borrowed. At 08:30, with rookie pilot Jean Bozon-Verduraz, Guynemer took off in his Spad XIII S.504 n¬∞2. His mission was to patrol the Langemark area. At 09:25, near Poelkapelle, Guynemer sighted a lone Rumpler, a German observation plane, and dove toward it. Bozon-Verduraz saw several Fokkers above him, and by the time he had shaken them off, his leader was nowhere in sight, so he returned alone. Guynemer never came back. Captain Georges Guynemer was confirmed missing in action by his squadron commander Major Brocard; it was officially announced in Paris by the French War Department on 25 September 1917. Unofficial confirmation came from a captured German pilot who was shot down behind Canadian lines the evening of 29 September.Air Service Journal. 4 October 1917. \\"Captain Guynemer Missing.\\" Vol. I, No. 13, p 413. A German sergeant from the 413th Regiment swore he had witnessed the crash and identified Guynemer's corpse; he also certified that the French hero had died from a bullet through the head, with other injuries including a broken leg and a finger shot away. The German party retrieving the body was driven away by Allied artillery fire before they could bury or remove the body. The 25 September details released by the French War Department were unclassified and became public knowledge as described by one of his flying comrades (name withheld due to security reasons): > Guynemer sighted five machines of the Albatros type D-3. Without hesitation, > he bore down on them. At that moment enemy patrolling machines, soaring at a > great height, appeared suddenly and fell upon Guynemer. There were forty > enemy machines in the air at this time, including Baron von Richthofen and > his circus division of machines, painted in diagonal blue and white stripes. > Toward Guynemer's right some Belgian machines hove in sight, but it was too > late. Guynemer must have been hit. His machine dropped gently toward the > earth, and I lost track of it. All that I can say is that the machine was > not on fire. Additional details were furnished by Major Brocard, as listed in an article from the Paris Le Matin: > The last fight of the French aviator occurred four or five miles inside the > German lines northeast of Ypres and opposite the British lines. Captain > Guynemer was accompanied by Lieutenant Bozon Verduraz, who says that they > were flying at a height of 15,000 feet when Guynemer sighted an enemy two- > seater, which he attacked. Almost at the same moment Verduraz saw four > German monoplanes approaching and turned toward them instantly so as to draw > them off. They circled around for a while and then disappeared. Verduraz > then returned to the place where he had left Guynemer engaged with the > German biplane, but Guynemer had vanished. The two-seater, described as a Rumpler type by Bozon-Verduraz, has never been identified, but recent research shows that it could have been a machine flown by Lt. d. R. Max Psaar (observer) and Fl. Georg Seibert (pilot) from FA(A)224.Marco Fernandez-Sommerau \\"A survivor in extremis, history of Rumpler 1463/17\\"- WW1Aero, Nr 188-189, May‚ÄìAugust 2005 The airman who shot down Guynemer was Lt Kurt Wissemann of Jasta 3 who was himself killed in action 28 September 1917. According to an American Red Cross communique from the French front, the death of Captain Georges Guynemer was determined to be \\"definitely confirmed\\".Air Service Journal. 18 October 1917. \\"Aerial Operations on the War Fronts. Guynemer Buried with Military Honors.\\" Vol. I, No. 15, p 475. This Red Cross report provided these details: > Information received by the Red Cross says Guynemer was shot through the > head north of Poelcapelle, on the Ypres front. His body was identified by a > photograph on his pilot's license found in his pocket. The burial took place > at Brussels in the presence of a guard of honor, composed of the 5th > Prussian Division. Such is the story told by a Belgian, who has just escaped > from the Germans. The burial was about to take place at Poelcapelle, when > the bombardment preceding the British attack at Ypres started. The burying > party hastily withdrew, taking the body with them. The German General > chanced to be an aviation enthusiast with a great admiration for Captain > Guynemer's achievements. At his direction the body was taken to Brussels in > a special funeral car. Thither the captain was carried by non-commissioned > officers and was covered with floral tributes from German aviators.

Guynemer had 54 victories at the time of his death. Legacy Guynemer's squadron emblem. Guynemer was lionized by the French press and became a national hero. The French government encouraged the publicity to boost morale and take the people's minds off the terrible losses in the trenches. Guynemer was embarrassed by the attention, but his shyness only increased the public's appetite to know everything about him. This was quite different later in 1918 with the French top ace Ren√© Fonck, who despite having 75 confirmed victories, had bad publicity for his arrogance and shameless self-promotion. Guynemer's death was a profound shock to France; nevertheless, he remained an icon for the duration of the war. Only 22 at his death, he continued to inspire the nation with his advice, \\"Until one has given all, one has given nothing.\\" The Paris street rue Guynemer is named after him:fr:Rue Guynemer as is a school in Compi√®gne, the Institution Guynemer. A statue is erected in Poelcapelle in commemoration of Georges Guynemer. The episode \\"The Last Flight\\" (1960) from season one of the American television series The Twilight Zone was loosely based on the disappearance of Guynemer put to fictional speculation as to what happened to him. He was decorated Order of Karaƒëorƒëe's Star with swords and a number of other decorations.

The business gave rise to a number of other companies, including Associated-Rediffusion, later known as Rediffusion London, one of the first companies to win a terrestrial ITV (commercial television) franchise in the UK. Rediffusion also spawned a record label, Rediffusion International Music, in 1968. Redifon was the name used until 1981 for companies in the capital goods businesses of Rediffusion, viz. Redifon Computers, Redifon Flight Simulation and Redifon Telecommunications. Early history Rediffusion was the trading name of Broadcast Relay Service Ltd, formed in 1928. In 1929 the company introduced its first cable radio service in Hull to customers frustrated with the difficulties of tuning in weak radio broadcasts. In the customer premises, nothing more than a selector switch and loudspeaker were needed. Initially, the service consisted primarily of rebroadcasts of the BBC Radio service, which was reflected in the trading name: Rediffusion simply means \\"broadcasting again\\". Rediffusion quickly branched out into making, renting, and selling radios, both receivers for its cable services and conventional models. With the arrival of the first experimental television broadcasts in the 1930s, Rediffusion began manufacturing TV sets and supplying \\"Piped TV\\", an early form of cable TV, service to its customers, until the cessation of television broadcasts during the Second World War. The first British colony to have the Rediffusion service was Barbados in 1934, when Radio Distribution (Barbados) Limited was formed. A year later, Rediffusion started operating in Malta. Transmissions in Malta started from Hamrun on 11 November 1935 under the name of \\"Broadcast Relay Service Malta Ltd.\\" Charles Whotcroft and George Powler were the first manager and chief engineer respectively.Ix-Xandir F'Malta, Remig Sacco, Malta 1985, 24. Post-war In 1947 British Electric Traction acquired a substantial minority interest in Rediffusion. BET acquired a controlling interest in 1967, and the remaining 36% of equity in 1983.Competition Commission report, 1985 The assertion on some websites that BET controlled Rediffusion from its inception does not appear to be right. In 1948 Rediffusion established Redifon Ltd as a manufacturer of naval (and later flight) telecommunications equipment. After the war, Rediffusion began operations in several of the then British colonies. These included holding the concessions for wired and over-the-air radio and television stations. A subsidiary company, Overseas Rediffusion, operated these stations and also sold advertising time and programming for them. Stations included the radio station Rediffusion Barbados, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the wired television service Rediffusion Television in Hong Kong, the latter later known as Asia Television. It also opened a company in Jersey in 1949, Rediffusion (Channel Islands) Limited, which obtained a licence to relay radio broadcasts from the States of Jersey in 1950. It also opened a manufacturing division in Jersey, Television Research Limited (TVR) which also provided research facilities for the wired network. This was established in 1952 and was renamed Reditronics Limited in 1976. BET's financial resources enabled Rediffusion to capitalise on the growth in post war television, which restarted in 1946. Initially, the company installed cable TV systems in blocks of flats in London, and over the next few years expanded outside London. The company was also involved in the sale and rental of television sets. Expansion into broadcasting With the passage of the Television Act 1954, Rediffusion joined forces with Associated Newspapers, a subsidiary of Daily Mail and General Trust, to form Associated-Rediffusion, and won the coveted London weekday ITV broadcast franchise. They began broadcasting on 22 September 1955. During the partnership's first year, Associated-Rediffusion was losing money so fast that by the end of 1956, Associated Newspapers sold 80% of its stake back to BET and Rediffusion at a severe loss. Around this time, Associated-Rediffusion struck a very lucrative deal with Granada Television, the franchise holder for weekday broadcasts in the North of England. Granada was also losing money, and lacked the financial resources of BET; the deal guaranteed Granada a certain level of financial security, at the cost of Associated-Rediffusion receiving the vast majority of future profits from their arrangement. On 29 September 1962 Rediffusion (Malta) Ltd. inaugurated a television service covering the Maltese islands.Public Service Broadcasting in the Age of Globalization, Indrajit Banerjee, Kalinga Seneviratne, AMIC, 2006, page 245 Rediffusion London ticket for an Around the Beatles dress rehearsal on 28 April 1964 By 1964, when Associated-Rediffusion changed its name to Rediffusion London, the efforts of the owners had left them sitting on a substantial cash pile, and it is arguable that this success may have led to the 1967 decision by the Independent Television Authority to effectively break up the company. Rediffusion London was ordered to merge with Associated British Corporation, the holder of the weekend Midlands and North of England franchises, to form Thames Television, with ABC given the controlling interest (despite its generally weaker financial position) and Rediffusion holding 49%. Thames Television was given the new weekday London franchise, with ABC's existing franchises awarded to other companies. Other ventures Rediffusion Cable A Rediffusion junction box installed in the exterior wall of a London house Rediffusion also offered a low-bandwidth cable TV and radio distribution system. This was based on connecting homes with multiple twisted-pair cables. Each pair carried a single TV or radio channel. The system was provided in most UK towns. Selection of TV or radio station was by means of a rotary switch, usually mounted on a wall or window frame close to the point of entry of the cable into the home. From this a two-wire cable led to the TV or radio. The TVs used on this system were stripped-down TV sets with no tuner or RF front-end and the radios were little more than a loudspeaker with built in amplifier. Rediffusion abandoned this system of TV and radio distribution by the end of the 1980s. The wall mounted switches, external junction boxes and street cable ducts are still visible in places that have not been redeveloped since the late 1980s. Overseas Rediffusion Long deactivated speaker for the Rediffusion located at the police station in Hastings, Christ Church, Barbados. BET and Rediffusion Limited had strong links with the former British colonies. These included holding the concessions for wired and over-the-air radio and television stations. A subsidiary company, Overseas Rediffusion, operated these stations and also sold advertising time and programming for them. Stations included the radio operations in Barbados, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Malaysia, Malta, Thailand and the wired television service Rediffusion Television in Hong Kong, the latter now known as Asia Television. Rediffusion Rentals The Rediffusion retail chain, renting and servicing TVs, radios, VCRs and hi-fi systems, was common on high streets until it was bought by Granada Rentals in 1984. Last years Rediffusion's television sale and rental operations continued to grow, particularly following the start of colour television broadcasts in 1967. Ex-Rediffusion House Malta now known as P.B.S Creativity Hub in Gwardamanƒ°a, built for Rediffusion (Malta) Ltd in 1958 On 14 February 1975 the employees of the Rediffusion (Malta) Ltd staged a sit-in strike at the company's premises in MaltaIx-xandir F'Malta, Tony C. Cutajar, Malta 2001, 63. and they even started to run the company.The Untruth Game, Francis Zammit Dimech, Malta 1986, 94. On 30 July 1975 an agreement was reached between Rediffusion Group of Companies and the Dom Mintoff led Labour Party government of Malta for the transfer of all Rediffusion's assets in Malta to the Maltese government.The Untruth Game, Francis Zammit Dimech, Malta 1986, 95. The company also experimented with its local cable operations: a local community station in Bristol (\\"Bristol Channel\\") from 1973 to 1976, and an optical fibre system in Hastings in 1976. The Rediffusion brand was also a name in aircraft simulation in both the UK and the US. Redifon, established in 1948, had become a manufacturer of flight simulators and in 1981 BET changed Redifon's name to Rediffusion Simulation to capitalise on the name. The company was sold in 1988 to Hughes Aircraft, which kept the Rediffusion name until it sold the company in 1994. Redifon (later Rediffusion) Computers was also part of the group and was based in Crawley, West Sussex. It initially started in the production of analogue computers to control flight simulators, then moved to produce minicomputers (\\"R range\\"), departmental Unix Servers and microcomputers (\\"teleputers\\"), specialising in data capture, enterprise accounting for local government and videotex systems. Michael Aldrich joined the company as Marketing Director in 1977 and became Managing Director and CEO in 1980. In 1979 Aldrich invented online shopping a form of electronic commerce. From 1980 the company designed, manufactured, sold, installed and maintained online shopping systems mainly in the UK and achieved a significant number of world firsts. The company‚Äôs name was changed to Rediffusion Computers in 1981. During the 1980s a large part of the company's revenue came from its sales in Eastern Europe and Russia. Equipment that met the CoCom directive for the sales of high performance technology to the Soviet Block was supplied to a number of customers the largest of which was Gazprom who used the systems on the Siberian Gas Pipeline project. In addition there was a steady stream of Polish engineers attending the Crawley training facility to enable them to support and maintain this equipment mainly in Russia but also in other countries in the Eastern Bloc. The company was highly innovative and amongst other things developed a signature recognition system for detecting cheque fraud. It was one of the first companies to sell a turnkey solution that utilised the newly available Post Office database (PAF) for postcode recognition. In 1984, Aldrich led a management buyout and the company became ROCC Computers (Rediffusion's Old Computer Company). Aldrich was the largest shareholder and he subsequently bought-out the other shareholders. In the 1980s, Rediffusion's cable operations were left behind by the new generation of cable TV networks. BET (from 1983 the sole owners of Rediffusion) began divesting and sold off its overseas interests, and at the end of the 1980s the company was broken up, The rentals business went to Granada, and the cable network systems were sold to the Maxwell Communications. Reditronics Jersey was sold to SCK Holdings Limited in 1986 and following BET's retreat from cable and the consequent loss of associated contracts, it ceased trading in 1987. The Rediffusion Jersey cable network was sold to Jersey Cable Limited (now Newtel Solutions) in 1988. In 1991, a Hong Kong-based branch of the company returned telerecorded copies of all four episodes of The Tomb of the Cybermen, a Doctor Who story from 1967 that was believed to have been lost for roughly fifteen years.

He was the son of composer Gerald Finzi and artist Joyce Black (known as Joy Finzi).  Background  Born in Hampstead, London in 1934, Finzi was the elder of Gerald Finzi's two sons. Both he and his younger brother Nigel (1936‚Äì2010) attended Bedales School in Hampshire, where they were exposed to a liberal education and intellectual freedom much in line with their parents' own progressive outlook on the world. Finzi attended the Royal Academy of Music and embarked on a career as a freelance cellist. He became the conductor of the Newbury String Players after the death of his father who had founded the orchestra. Like his father, the younger Finzi became a pacifist. As a conscientious objector he refused military service in 1955 and was briefly imprisoned before being allowed to do farm work. After his father's death in 1956, he helped his mother to establish the Finzi Trust and sustain Gerald Finzi's reputation. Their lifestyle was bohemian, living in a remote farmhouse.  Marriage  Finzi married Hilary du Pr√©, a flautist, in 1961. They raised their four children, Theresa, Clare, Nicolette and Orlando, at Church Farm in Ashmansworth, Hampshire, the family home built by Finzi's parents. Du Pr√©'s younger sister, the cellist Jacqueline du Pr√©, was part of their household during the 1970s. Hilary du Pr√©'s 1997 memoir A Genius in the Family, written with her brother Piers du Pr√©, created controversy when it was revealed that Finzi had had an affair with his sister-in-law. The 1998 film Hilary and Jackie, the plot of which was based on interviews with Hilary and Piers, told the same basic story and was also controversial.  Later life  Finzi eventually turned his attention away from music to farming, establishing a poultry business at Ashmansworth. He and his wife operated a health food shop in Newbury, Berkshire. He made several recordings in his capacity as a conductor, including a performance of Gerald Finzi's Dies Natalis and music by British composers Robin Milford and Edmund Rubbra. From 1971 to 1997, Finzi was resident conductor of the North Wiltshire Orchestra. Finzi died in November 2019, aged 85.

During the Middle Ages there was a castle and village at Bremgarten, though no trace remains. However, in 1978, the outer curtain wall of the old castle was discovered. The castle, the home of the Lords of Bremgarten, was located at a narrow point on the Aare peninsula. The castle was the center of a barony that stretched along the Aare river at least as far as from Worblaufen to Kirchlindach. The Bremgarten family's personal church, St. Michaels Church was first mentioned in 1275, though it was built in the 10th or 11th century and the choir was rebuilt in 1306. In 1298, the town and castle were destroyed by Bern after the Bernese victory at the Battle of Donnerb√ºhl. In 1306, the Lords of Bremgarten sold their land, rights and their ferry, to the Knights Hospitaller commandry of M√ºnchenbuchsee. Under the Commandery, the town and castle were rebuilt and the castle became the seat of the commander. In 1510 the lands in Bremgarten were sold to the Stuckihaus Commandery to hold as a fief. Following the Protestant Reformation, the Commandery was secularized in 1529 and its land became part of Bern. The last commander of M√ºnchenbuchsee Commandry retired to Bremgarten Castle for the remainder of his life. Bremgarten was assigned to the high court of Zollikofen. Much of the land that had been part of the Barony of Bremgarten was broken up to form new municipalities. In 1545, Bern sold the village and low court right to the Schultheiss Hans Franz Nageli. He demolished the old castle, except for the keep and curtain walls, and had a renaissance country manor built. Over the following centuries the castle and land was repeatedly inherited, bought and sold by Bern's patrician families. It was held in 1579-92 by the Br√ºgger family, 1592-1727 by the Kilchberger, 1727-43 by the de Chemilleret, 1743-61 by the von Wattenwyl and in 1761-65 by Fischer von Reichenbach. In 1743-47 the medieval keep and ramparts of the castle were demolished to make way for a baroque summer palace. Starting in 1765, the new owner Albrecht von Frisching, encouraged many tenants and craftsmen to settle in Bremgarten to help him rebuild the castle. By 1780 the project was finished and the castle was completely rebuilt. He had the castle hill built up and leveled to create a spacious courtyard and gardens around the castle.Swisscastles.ch accessed 3 July 2012 In 1770-71 the country estates of Belvedere (Friedrich von Luternau) and Aarwyl (Rudolf Albrecht Haller) were built in Bremgarten. During the 19th century, Bremgarten Castle changed hands frequently, until 1918 when it was bought by the wealthy industrialist Wassmer family. They repaired the castle and in 1978 fully restored it. After the 1798 French invasion and under the Helvetic Republic, Bremgarten was granted a town council and became part of the District of Bern. The first bridge over the Aare at Bremgarten was the Neubr√ºgg which was built in 1466. However, the town remained isolated from the major roads leading to Bern until the 20th century. In 1921, the much larger Seftausteg bridge was built next to the Neubr√ºgg. This was followed in 1928 by the Felsenaubr√ºcke which was built by the army as a wooden bridge in 1929 and rebuilt as a solid-web girder bridge made of packed concrete in 1949. The town was chronically short of money and sought to be incorporated into Bern in 1925, 1934 and 1945. A building boom in the 1950s helped alleviate many of the town's financial problems. With little industrial development, Bremgarten has remained a bedroom community of Bern with over 80% of the working population commuting to Bern.

It is found in eastern Madagascar and on the islands Nosy Bohara and Nosy Mangabe. These geckos live in tropical rain forests. They reach a total length of 330 mm. Etymology The generic name, Uroplatus, is a Latinization of two Greek words: \\"our√°\\" (Œø·ΩêœÅŒ¨) meaning \\"tail\\" and \\"platys\\" (œÄŒªŒ±œÑœçœÇ) meaning \\"flat\\". Its specific name fimbriatus is the Latin word for \\"fringed\\" based upon the gecko's unique appearance of fringed skin. Description It is a large nocturnal gecko. Because the eyes are extremely sensitive to light, 350 times more sensitive than the human eye, the species is able to see in colors even at night. By day it plasters itself to a small tree trunk and rests head down. If disturbed it will raise its tail and head, open its mouth and scream. Threats Habitat destruction and deforestation in Madagascar is the primary threat to this animal's future as well as collection for the pet trade. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the Uroplatus species on their \\"Top ten most wanted species list\\" of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it \\"being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade\\". It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal. However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the commercial export as likely sustainable.

A guitar solo is a melodic passage, instrumental section, or entire piece of music written for a classical guitar, electric guitar or an acoustic guitar. In 20th and 21st century traditional music and popular music such as blues, swing, jazz, jazz fusion, rock and metal, guitar solos often contain virtuoso techniques and varying degrees of improvisation. Guitar solos on classical guitar, which are typically written in musical notation, are also used in classical music forms such as chamber music and concertos. Guitar solos range from unaccompanied works for a single guitar to compositions with accompaniment from a few other instruments or a large ensemble. The accompaniment musicians for a guitar solo can range from a small ensemble such as a jazz quartet or a rock band, to a large ensemble such as an orchestra or big band. Unaccompanied acoustic guitar music is found in folk and classical music dating as far back as the instrument has existed, and the use of an acoustic guitar as a solo voice within an ensemble dates back at least to the Baroque concerto. Classical guitar Classical guitar soloist Andr√©s Segovia (1962) The classical guitar (also called the Spanish guitar) is an acoustical wooden guitar with six strings, usually nylon, as opposed to the metal strings used in acoustic and electric guitars. Classical guitar is typically played by plucking individual strings with the fingernails or, rarely, the fingertips. A classical guitar solo concert is typically called a recital; it may include a variety of works, e.g. works written originally for the lute or vihuela by composers such as John Dowland (b. Ireland 1563) and Luis de Narv√°ez (b. Spain c. 1500), and also music written for the harpsichord by Domenico Scarlatti (b. Italy 1685), for the baroque lute by Sylvius Leopold Weiss (b. Germany 1687), for the baroque guitar by Robert de Vis√©e (b. France c. 1650) or even Spanish-flavored music written for the piano by Isaac Alb√©niz (b. Spain 1860) and Enrique Granados (b. Spain 1867). The most important composer who did not write for the guitar but whose music is often played on it is Johann Sebastian Bach (b. Germany 1685), whose baroque lute works have proved highly adaptable to the instrument. Of music written originally for guitar, the earliest important composers are from the classical period and include Fernando Sor (b. Spain 1778) and Mauro Giuliani (b. Italy 1781), both of whom wrote in a style strongly influenced by Viennese classicism. In the 19th century guitar composers such as Johann Kaspar Mertz (b. Slovakia, Austria 1806) were strongly influenced by the dominance of the piano. Not until the end of the nineteenth century did the guitar begin to establish its own unique identity. Francisco T√°rrega (b. Spain 1852) was central to this, sometimes incorporating stylized aspects of flamenco's Moorish influences into his romantic miniatures. This was part of late 19th century mainstream European musical nationalism. Alb√©niz and Granados were central to this movement; their evocation of the guitar was so successful that their compositions have been absorbed into standard guitar repertoire. Some classical guitarists play concertos, which are solos written for performance with the accompaniment of an orchestra. Not many classical guitar concertos have been written, however, which may perhaps be laid to the imbalance between the volume of multi-instrumental orchestra as compared to a single guitar. Nevertheless, some guitar concertos are nowadays wide known and popular, especially Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez (with the famous theme from 2nd movement) and Fantas√≠a para un gentilhombre. Composers who also wrote well known guitar concertos are: Antonio Vivaldi (originally for mandolin or lute), Mauro Giuliani, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Manuel Ponce, Leo Brouwer and Lennox Berkeley. In the 2000s, contemporary composers are increasingly writing guitar concertos. History Composers of the Renaissance period who wrote for four course guitar include Alonso Mudarra, Miguel de Fuenllana, Adrian Le Roy and Guillaume de Morlaye. Some well known composers of the baroque guitar were Gaspar Sanz, Robert de Vis√©e and Francesco Corbetta. From approximately 1780 to 1850, the guitar had numerous composers and performers including: Filippo Gragnani (1767‚Äì1820), Antoine de Lhoyer (1768‚Äì1852), Ferdinando Carulli (1770‚Äì1841), Francesco Molino (1774‚Äì1847), Fernando Sor (1778‚Äì1839), Mauro Giuliani (1781‚Äì1829), Niccol√≤ Paganini (1782‚Äì1840), Dionisio Aguado (1784 ‚Äì 1849), Luigi Legnani (1790‚Äì1877), Matteo Carcassi (1792‚Äì1853), Napol√©on Coste (1805‚Äì1883) and Johann Kaspar Mertz (1806‚Äì1856). Beginning in the 1920s, guitar soloist Andr√©s Segovia popularized the guitar with tours and early phonograph recordings. Modern classical guitar solo performers who are known for playing modern repertoire include Leo Brouwer, John Schneider, Reinbert Evers, Maria K√§mmerling, Siegfried Behrend, David Starobin, Mats Scheidegger, John Williams, and Magnus Andersson. Traditional and popular music Blues, R&B; and rock and roll American blues guitarist and singer B.B. King in 2009. Even though guitar solos are used in a wide range of genres, the term \\"guitar solo\\" often refers to electric guitar solos played in blues and in rock. Unlike acoustic guitars like the classical guitar or steel-string guitar, the electric guitar is played through a guitar amplifier to make the instrument loud enough. Guitar amplifiers also have preamplifier and tone controls, and in some cases, overdrive controls that modify the tone. The use of a guitar solo as an instrumental interlude was developed by blues musicians such as John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, and T-Bone Walker, and jazz like Charlie Christian. Ernest Tubb's 1940 honky tonk classic, Walking the Floor over You was the first \\"hit\\" recording to feature and highlight a solo by a standard electric guitar‚Äìthough earlier hits featured electric lap steel guitars. Blues master Lonnie Johnson had also recorded at least one electric guitar solo, but his innovation was neither much noted nor influential. Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Jimmy Reed played in Chicago in a style characterized by the use of electric guitar, sometimes slide guitar, harmonica, and a rhythm section of bass and drums. In the late 1950s, a new blues style emerged on Chicago's West Side pioneered by Magic Sam, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush on Cobra Records.Koroma, pg. 49 The 'West Side Sound' had strong rhythmic support from a rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums and as pefected by Guy, Freddie King, Magic Slim and Luther Allison was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar. Other blues artists, such as John Lee Hooker had influences not directly related to the Chicago style. John Lee Hooker's blues is more \\"personal,\\" based on Hooker's deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar. These and other blues guitarists inspired the appearance of many virtuoso blues rock fusion soloists, beginning in 1963 with Lonnie Mack's first major recordings. Mack augmented his blues solos with fast-picking country techniques, and set them to a rock beat. His early recordings are widely regarded as a critical milestone in the rise of the electric guitar's role to that of a lead voice in rock music. See, Wikipedia article on Lonnie Mack. One such soloist, Jimi Hendrix, was a rarity in his field at the time: a black man who played psychedelic rock. Hendrix was a skilled guitarist, and a pioneer in the innovative use of distortion and audio feedback in his music.Garofalo, pgs. 224‚Äì225 Through these artists and others, blues music influenced the development of rock music. Another important blues rock guitar soloist in the 1960s and 1970s was Eric Clapton. In the early 1970s, the Texas rock-blues style emerged, which used guitars in both solo and rhythm roles (e.g., Stevie Ray Vaughan). Rock The earliest rock guitar solos, as exemplified by popular recordings of Duane Eddy and Link Wray in the late 1950s, were relatively simple instrumental melodies. Describing all of these as \\"inherently simple\\": Brown & Newquist, Legends of Rock Guitar, Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997, at p. 21. In the early 1960s, instrumental surf music represented a step forward in the sonic complexity of rock guitar melodies. In 1963, the dramatic, technically advanced electric guitar solo rose to the fore with Lonnie Mack's hit records, \\"Memphis\\" and \\"Wham!\\" (later covered by The Ventures, Stevie Ray Vaughan and others), and soon, with the advent of blues rock and psychedelic rock in the mid-late 1960s, became a characteristic part of rock music. Later still, guitar solos became a defining feature of the rock genre of heavy metal, in which most songs feature a solo. Metal solos often showcase the virtuosity of the guitarists, especially in metal styles that use shred guitar techniques for rapid playing of scales and arpeggios. Since the 1960s, electric guitarists have often altered the timbre of their guitar adding electronic guitar effects such as reverb, distortion, delay, and chorus to make the sound fuller and add harmonic overtones. Other effects used in solos include the wah pedal and the talk box. Rock bands often have two guitarists, designated \\"lead\\" and \\"rhythm\\", with the lead player performing the solos and instrumental melody lines while the rhythm player accompanies with chords or riffs. In some cases, two guitarists share the lead role. Most rock music is based around songs in traditional forms. The main formal features are verses, choruses, and bridges. The guitar solo is usually the most significant instrumental section of a mainstream rock song. In other rock-related genres, such as pop and dance music, the synthesizer usually plays this role. In classic verse‚Äìchorus form, it often falls between the second chorus and third verse. Extended guitar solos are sometimes used as a song‚Äôs outro, such as Christopher Cross' \\"Ride Like the Wind\\", Radiohead‚Äôs \\"Paranoid Android\\", Lynyrd Skynyrd‚Äôs \\"Free Bird\\", The Stooges' \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\", Pink Floyd‚Äôs \\"Comfortably Numb\\", Guns N' Roses‚Äô \\"November Rain\\", Metallica‚Äôs \\"Fade to Black\\", Led Zeppelin‚Äôs \\"Black Dog\\", Journey's \\"Who's Crying Now\\", The Cult's \\"Love Removal Machine\\", The Beatles‚Äô \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", .38 Special's \\"Hold On Loosely\\", The Rolling Stones‚Äô \\"Sway\\", Pearl Jam‚Äôs \\"Alive\\", Red Hot Chili Peppers‚Äô \\"Dani California\\", Cream‚Äôs \\"White Room\\", AC/DC‚Äôs \\"Let There Be Rock\\", Outlaws‚Äô \\"Green Grass and High Tides\\", The Alan Parsons Project‚Äôs \\"Eye in the Sky\\" and Eagles‚Äô \\"Hotel California\\". Solos can take place in the intro, such as \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\" by Jimi Hendrix, \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" by Led Zeppelin, \\"One\\" by Metallica, \\"Lazy\\" by Deep Purple, \\"I Want It All\\" by Queen, \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" by Chuck Berry, \\"Don't Take Me Alive\\" by Steely Dan, \\"Sails of Charon\\" by Scorpions and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" by Pink Floyd. In rarer cases, the guitar solo may come after the first chorus as opposed to the second, such as \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" by Avenged Sevenfold and \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" by Oasis. Eddie Van Halen in 1977 The use of guitar solos in hard rock and heavy metal was notable during the 1980s, when rapid-fire \\"shredding\\" solos were common; a virtuostic lead guitarist of a band might be more well-known than the singer. During this time, players began to use advanced harmonics techniques more widely. Later, guitarists who had developed considerable technical facility began to release albums with instrumental-only guitar compositions. Guitar solos in popular music waned in fashion in the middle 1990s, coinciding with the rise in popularity of nu metal and grunge. Nu metal differed significantly from previous sub-genres of metal and abandoned guitar solos altogether, except for a few rare lead fills here and there, whilst grunge did not wholly abandon solos and included them from time to time. Guitar solos likewise became less prominent in many pop and popular rock music styles; either being trimmed down to a short four-bar transition or omitted entirely, in a vast departure from the heavy usage of solos in classic rock music from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Classic rock revival music heavily features soloing, along with classic rock bands that are still active as of 2018. Occasionally, a song contains a two-part guitar solo with both rhythm and lead guitar taking solos (e.g., \\"Master of Puppets\\" by Metallica), or dual solos with both lead and rhythm playing complementary solos‚Äîsuch as with Twisted Sister‚Äôs \\"30\\", Iron Maiden's \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", \\"The Trooper\\" or Megadeth's \\"Mechanix\\". Some rock bands use harmonized dual lead guitar solos as part of their signature sound, such as Wishbone Ash. This was first popularized by the Allman Brothers Band in their album At Fillmore East. Bass guitar solos Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is played through a specialized amplifier to make the instrument louder and provided control over tone. The bass guitar came into use in popular music in the 1950s. While bass guitar solos are not common in popular music, some bands include bass solos in some songs, particularly heavy metal, funk, and progressive rock bands. Some genres use bass guitar solos in most songs, such as jazz bands or jazz fusion groups. Bass solos are also common in certain styles of punk music. In a rock context, bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections. While bass guitar solos appear on few studio albums from rock or pop bands, genres such as progressive rock, fusion-influenced rock, and some types of heavy metal are more likely to include bass solos, both in studio albums and in live performances. Players perform bass solos with a range of techniques, such as plucking or finger picking. In the 1960s, The Who's bassist, John Entwistle, performed a bass break on the song \\"My Generation\\" using a plectrum, though he intended to use his fingers‚Äîhe simply couldn't drop the plectrum quickly enough. Many consider this one of the first bass solos in rock music, and one of the most recognizable. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, on \\"Good Times Bad Times\\", the first song on their first album, uses two bass solos in an influentially dynamic way, as a bridge (when the band drops out after the choruses) to the next verse (after the first chorus) and the guitar solo-driven coda (after the third chorus). Queen's bassist, John Deacon, occasionally played bass solos, notably in \\"Under Pressure\\" and \\"Liar\\". In the 1970s, Aerosmith's bassist, Tom Hamilton, played a bass intro on the song \\"Sweet Emotion\\" from their album Toys in the Attic. Thrash metal group Metallica's 1983 debut album Kill 'Em All features a solo by bassist Cliff Burton on \\"(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth\\", which some consider his greatest work. John McVie of Fleetwood Mac performed a notable bass solo on \\"The Chain\\" from the record-setting 1977 album Rumours. Manowar's bassist Joey DeMaio uses special piccolo bass for his extremely fast bass solos like \\"Sting of the Bumblebee\\" and \\"William's Tale\\". Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt played a bass solo on the song \\"No One Knows\\" from the 1992 album Kerplunk! and on the song \\"Makeout Party\\" from the 2012 album ¬°Dos!. U2 includes a bass solo most notably on \\"Gloria\\", in which Adam Clayton utilizes several techniques. Bassist Matt Freeman of Rancid has a very speedy, guitar- like bass solo in the song '\\"Maxwell Murder\\". Blink-182's \\"Voyeur\\" has a bass solo on both their studio album Dude Ranch and their live album The Mark, Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!), in which they must \\"prepare for the bass solo.\\" Heavy metal bass players such as Geezer Butler (Black Sabbath), Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse), Cliff Burton (Metallica), jazz fusion bassist Jaco Pastorius (Weather Report), and Les Claypool (Primus, Blind Illusion) used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. Geddy Lee of Rush performed a number of solos, most notably in \\"YYZ\\". Also, in both published Van Halen concert videos, Michael Anthony performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. Funk bassists, such as Larry Graham, began using slapping and popping techniques for their bass solos, which coupled a percussive thumb-slapping technique of the lower strings with an aggressive finger-snap of the higher strings, often in rhythmic alternation. The slapping and popping technique incorporates a large number of muted (or 'ghost' tones) to normal notes to add to the rhythmic effect. Slapping and popping solos were prominent in 1980s pop and R&B;, and they are still used by some 2000s-era funk and Latin bands. When playing bass solos, hard rock and heavy metal bassists sometimes use bass effects such as fuzz bass or wah-wah pedals to produce a more pronounced sound. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both distortion and wah-wah. Due to the lower range of the bass, bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments. In some cases, the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied, or accompanied only by the drums.

The Central Basin was caused by an uplifting which produced a dome known as the Nashville Dome. The Nashville Dome is evidenced by the underlying rock strata that all dip downwards away from Nashville. The uplifting of the Nashville Dome fractured overlying strata, making it more easily eroded and thus the \\"dome\\" resulted in a \\"basin\\". Uplifted strata in the center of a geological dome have higher potential erosive energy than the surrounding strata, because they are physically higher. Erosion thus acts on the uplifted area at a greater rate than on the surrounding flat-lying area, creating a low area, i.e. a basin. This area is more correctly referred to as the \\"Central Dome\\" of Tennessee. Nashville is located in the northwestern portion of the Central Basin. The basin extends for approximately forty-five to sixty miles to the east of Nashville, and about eighty miles to the south, near the Tennessee‚ÄìAlabama state line. Travelers leaving Nashville in a northerly or easterly direction will soon begin the climb up the escarpment that marks the bordering geographic/geologic province, the Highland Rim and further eastwards, the Cumberland Plateau. The southern edge of the Highland Rim is more distant and somewhat less pronounced. The only downhill routes leaving the area follow the course of the Cumberland River as it flows northwest toward Ashland City and Clarksville, Tennessee. The Central Basin is underlain primarily by limestone from the Ordovician Period. The Nashville Basin and a similar but smaller area surrounding Lexington, Kentucky referred to as the \\"Kentucky Bluegrass\\" area, are the two primary areas of this sort in the world. The Inner Basin of the flattest terrain and most limestone-derived soil chemistry is located to the south and east of Nashville, primarily in the counties of Marshall, Rutherford, Wilson, and Bedford. Here also are seen the horse farms somewhat reminiscent of the Kentucky Bluegrass region. Supposedly the underlying rock weathers to a soil particularly suited to the growing of the sorts of grasses most favored by horses. Limestone glades (or cedar glades), located to the east of Nashville, primarily in Wilson and Rutherford Counties, are open areas where the flat limestone rock is denuded of overlying soil or nearly so, provide an environment for flora unlike any other in the world.

History B√ºren Castle, built as the official residence of the Bernese bailiff. Tour boat Stadt Solothurn passing under the wooden bridge at B√ºren an der Aare. B√ºren an der Aare is first mentioned in 1185 as Buirro. In 1236 it was mentioned as Buron. The formerly independent village of Reiben was first mentioned in 1309. It became part of B√ºren an der Aare in 1911. The earliest trace of humans in B√ºren are scattered neolithic and La Tene items. The Roman era road between Aventicum and Salodurum (Solothurn) runs through the area that would become the municipality. Roman ruins include part of the road and a milestone at B√ºrenmoos, a canal at Burgweg and what may have been a country estate on Kirchmatt. Above the town, on the Schlosshubel hill, was the high medieval Strassberg Castle, the home of the Baron of Strassberg. The town was built on a narrow strip of land between the St√§dtiberg and the Aare. The town received a town charter from Berchtold I of Strassberg in 1260, which was confirmed in 1288. Under the Barons, the town became the center of the B√ºren Herrschaft. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the Counts of Neuch√¢tel gained power in the Herrschaft. In 1345, financial difficulties forced Imer of Strassberg to pledge some rights in the town to Solothurn. In 1369 Solothurn also acquired the right to collect duties and tolls in B√ºren. In 1375 Enguerrand de Coucy besieged the town, but did not take it. After Imer's death the town was inherited by the Counts of Neu-Kyburg, who then sold it to Austria. During the Sempach War, B√ºren was besieged and captured by Bern and in 1388 it was placed under joint Bern-Solothurn control. In 1393, the captured land was finally divided and B√ºren became the capital of a new Bernese bailiwick. In 1620-25 B√ºren Castle was built on the main street as the official residence of the Bernese bailiff. The oldest part of the town church of St. Catherine is the choir from the third quarter of the 13th century. The rest of the church was completed between then and 1500. By 1375 it was an independent parish church. The town council appointed its first recorded Schultheiss in 1254. The oldest town seal is from 1273. The 1288 town charter granted it the right to hold markets. In 1284, a toll bridge over the Aare was first mentioned. In 1478, the salt, iron, steel, wool and linen markets came under Bernese control. The town had both a market square and docks on the Aare as well as inns and warehouses to encourage traders to come to B√ºren. In 1481, weekly markets were added to the quarterly fairs that they had been holding. The town's economy was based on both trade and agriculture. During the 15th and 16th century a new town hall was built with a market hall on the ground floor. In the 16th century a hospital and school opened. Starting in the 15th century, the town began operating mountain pastures, a dairy and a cheese-maker as a fief of the Prince-Bishop of Basel. The now disused brickworks was first mentioned in 1630. After the 1798 French invasion, it became the capital of the Helvetic Republic's B√ºren District. After the Act of Mediation and the Congress of Vienna the district remained as a part of the Canton of Bern. During the 19th century, the town began to decline. No major railway line passes through it and water transportation had declined in importance. In 1876 the regional Lyss-Solothurn railway line connected the town to its neighbors. A few small factories moved in including watch manufactures, but they have since closed. Only the old gear and machinery factory (built in 1946) and a meat processing plant (built in 1945) remain of the older factories. However, a new anodizing and electronics moved into B√ºren in the end of the 20th century. The Nidau- B√ºren channel, built in 1868-75, helped protect the town from flooding and opened up new agricultural land. The cultivation of sugar beets and livestock remain important. During World War II it was the site of the largest refugee camp in Switzerland. The wooden bridge was built in 1821 and replaced in 1991 after a fire 1991. In addition to the district administration, B√ºren is home to the forestry office, the secondary school, a nursing home and an outpatient hospital care facility.

This involves continual execution of Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding (TT&C;) operations. In addition, the AFSCN provides prelaunch checkout and simulation, launch support, and early orbit support while satellites are in initial or transfer orbits and require maneuvering to their final orbit. The AFSCN provides tracking data to help maintain the catalog of space objects and distributes various data such as satellite ephemeris, almanacs, and other information. Overview The AFSCN consists of satellite control centers, tracking stations, and test facilities located around the world. Satellite Operations Centers (SOCs) are located at Schriever Air Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colorado, and various other locations throughout the continental United States. These SOCs are manned around the clock and are responsible for the command and control of their assigned satellite systems. The SOCs are linked to remote tracking stations (RTSs) around the world. Space vehicle checkout facilities are used to test launch vehicles and satellite platforms to ensure that the onboard systems operate within specifications. The RTSs provide the link between the satellites and the SOCs. A similar relationship exists for dedicated networks, which are outside the purview of the AFSCN. RTSs around the world are needed to maintain frequent communications with the satellite. Without RTSs, the SOCs would only be able to contact a satellite when it came into the control center's view. Some satellites, especially those in geostationary orbit, never come within view of their control center. Each antenna at an RTS is referred to as a \\"side\\". Previously, Side A typically included a dish antenna. Side B typically included a antenna. At some sites, the B side included a antenna. Over time, however, as the network upgraded and/or replaced the antennas, the old conventions no longer apply. History AFSCN was originally activated to support the CORONA (Discoverer) program in 1959. An interim satellite control center was initially established in Palo Alto, California, and by June 1960, a permanent control center had been established Sunnyvale AFS, later renamed Onizuka AFS, Sunnyvale, California. The main operations control center, now at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado Springs, CO, functions as a central command and control node for the remote tracking stations established at several different locations. Locations *Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado ‚Äì Primary C2 Node *Ellison Onizuka Satellite Operations Facility (EOSOF) at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California ‚Äì Secondary C2 Node. The AFSCN maintains a number of tracking stations, which are used to track (primarily) US government agency & military satellites, as well as receive and process telemetry and send commands to these satellites. Said facilities are intended to support all Department of Defense satellites. Most tracking stations are operated by operational detachments of the 21st Space Operations Squadron (21 SOPS) and 23d Space Operations Squadron. Many scientific and research satellites are supported as well. Current Remote Tracking Stations * Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Diego Garcia, BIOT; callsign REEF. The Diego Garcia Station has two sides (as of 2010) to provide enhanced tracking for the AFSCN users. This site also includes a GPS Ground Antenna site. * Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Guam; callsign GUAM. The Guam Tracking Station has two sides (one ARTS and one RBC) and is undergoing a \\"hybridization\\" upgrade that replaces the old A-side ARTS system with an RBC core electronics suite and upgrades the existing 60-foot antenna. * Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), Kaena Point Satellite Tracking Station, Hawaii; callsign HULA. The Hawaii Tracking Station is located on the island of Oahu and also includes an ARTS side and an RBC side. The Hawaii Tracking Station is also undergoing a \\"hybridization\\" effort that will replace the old B-side ARTS system and upgrade the existing 60-foot antenna (previously the A-side). * New Hampshire Station (NHS), New Boston AFS, New Hampshire; callsign BOSS. The New Hampshire Tracking Station is located in New Boston, New Hampshire. As of 2013, the site had two ARTS sides and an RBC side. * Telemetry & Command Station (TCS), RAF Oakhanger, in England, operated by the United Kingdom and supporting the AFSCN through a Memorandum of Agreement between the UK Ministry of Defence and the US Department of Defense; callsign LION. As of 2010, the site includes three sides, two ARTS and an RBC. * Thule Tracking Station (TTS), Thule Air Base, Greenland; callsign POGO was a three-sided site until the summer of 2011, when the \\"C\\" side was decommissioned and dismantled in preparation for system upgrades. In May, 2013, the A-side antenna suffered a mechanical failure that prompted an early decommissioning. From that time, the site operated only with its B-side. Starting in 2014, the new C-side RBC installation got under way. This is the northernmost RTS, located at approximately 76.4 degrees north latitude. As of February 2015, the RBC installation is nearly complete, with just a few minor details to be finished before the formal testing gets underway in the May/June timeframe. * Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), California; callsign COOK. This is a dual-sided station which provides normal on-orbit support but also provides pre-launch checkouts and launch support for the Western Test Range at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Automated Remote Tracking Stations In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the RTSs were modernized with the addition of the Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) systems. The ARTS systems provided more responsive support and reduced the manpower required at each site through semi-automation. In addition to upgrading all the existing sites, the ARTS Phase I program added the following sites to the AFSCN: *Colorado Tracking Station at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado, which had a \\"cessation of operations\\" in August 2012 and was formally deactivated in 2014 *Thule Tracking Station \\"C\\" side, which was decommissioned in 2011 and dismantled that summer *Telemetry and Command Station \\"B\\" side *Diego Garcia Station \\"A\\" side RTS Block Change (RBC) Systems Beginning in 2004, an upgrade effort was started to replace the ARTS sites, which were already beyond their planned design life. While the project has been hampered by a number of technical issues and funding problems, the effort is well underway. As of 1 October 2014, the following sites have been upgraded to the RBC configuration, which includes a 13-meter 3-axis antenna: *Vandenberg Tracking Station \\"A\\" side *Diego Garcia Station \\"B\\" side, added to the network during the upgrade effort *Telemetry and Command Station \\"C\\" side, added to the network during the upgrade effort *Hawaii Tracking Station \\"A\\" side *Guam Tracking Station \\"B\\" side *New Hampshire Station \\"B\\" side *Thule Tracking Station \\"C\\" side Closed Remote Tracking Stations *Indian Ocean Station (IOS), Mahe Island, Seychelles; callsign INDI (closed in August 1996, after the Government of Seychelles attempted to \\"raise the rent\\" to more than $10 million/year). The Indian Ocean Tracking Station was located on the island of Mahe, the main island of the Seychelles archipeligo. It had one 60-foot antenna. Its location was ideal for communicating with geosynchronous satellites over the Indian Ocean. The station was also geographically suited for acquiring realtime or near-realtime data from passes over areas to the north. In 1980, due to political instabilities of the island, the main processing computers were removed and relocated to Sunnyvale. These computers communicated with the IOS downlink and tracking equipment via a wideband (DSCS) communications link. IOS has been supplanted by Diego Garcia RTS. *Kodiak Tracking Station (KTS), Kodiak Island, Alaska; callsign KODI (closed on 20 March 1975) *Sunnyvale Control Station, callsign CUBE. Not a true tracking station, in that it had no direct downlink antenna. Instead, CUBE supported operations at TCS/Oakhangar and IOS/Seychelles, where main processing computers could not be located. CUBE had two 'sides', and so could support two satellite passes simultaneously. * Colorado Tracking Station (CTS), Schriever AFB, Colorado; callsign PIKE. As of 2008, this site transitioned from an operational location to a testing facility, with operational support as possible. This site formally ceased operational support on 2 August 2012. It used to support various DoD satellites and previously included enhancement equipment that was used to support the Global Positioning System satellites. On 30 September 2014, the site was formally deactivated and closed. See also *50th Space Wing *Phoenix Echo References * United States Army. (1993). Space Reference Text.

He was a founding member of the Acad√©mie de peinture et de sculpture in Paris, the premier art institution in France in the eighteenth century. Life and work Born of a poor family in Brussels (Duchy of Brabant, Southern Netherlands), during the reign of the Archduke Albert and Isabella, Champaigne was a pupil of the landscape painter Jacques Fouqui√®res. In 1621 he moved to Paris, where he worked with Nicolas Poussin on the decoration of the Palais du Luxembourg under the direction of Nicolas Duchesne, whose daughter he married. According to Houbraken, Duchesne was angry at Champaigne for becoming more popular than he was at court, and this is why Champaigne returned to Brussels to live with his brother. Ex-Voto de 1662, 1662, Louvre It was only after he received news of Duchesne's death that he returned to marry his daughter.Philips de Champanje biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature After the death of his protector Duchesne, Champaigne worked for the Queen Mother, Marie de Medicis, for whom he participated in the decoration of the Luxembourg Palace. He made several paintings for the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, dating from 1638. He also drew several cartoons for tapestries. He was made first painter of the Queen with a pension of 1200 pounds. He also decorated the Carmelite Church of Faubourg Saint-Jacques, one of the favorite churches of the Queen Mother. This site was destroyed during the French Revolution, but there are several paintings now preserved in museums, that were part of the original design. The Presentation in the Temple is in Dijon, the Resurrection of Lazarus is in Grenoble and the Assumption of the Virgin is in the Louvre. He also worked for Cardinal Richelieu, for whom he decorated the Palais Cardinal, the dome of the Sorbonne and other buildings. Champaigne was the only artist who was allowed to paint Richelieu enrobed as a cardinal, which he did eleven times. He was a founding member of the Acad√©mie de peinture et de sculpture in 1648. Later in his life (from 1640 onwards), he came under the influence of Jansenism. After his paralysed daughter was allegedly miraculously cured at the nunnery of Port-Royal, he painted the celebrated but atypical picture Ex-Voto de 1662, now in the Louvre, which represents the artist's daughter with Mother-Superior Agn√®s Arnauld. Career French poet Vincent Voiture depicted as Saint Louis Champaigne produced a very large number of paintings, mainly religious works and portraits. Influenced by Rubens at the beginning of his career, his style later became more austere. Philippe de Champaigne remains an exceptional painter thanks to the brilliance of the colors in his paintings and the stern strength of his compositions. He portrayed the entire French court, the French high nobility, royalty, high members of the church and the state, parliamentarians and architects, and other notable people. His portrait of the poet Vincent Voiture was created around 1649 as the frontispiece for Voiture's published Works (published posthumously in 1650). The portrait is highly unusual in that Champaigne later reworked it as a portrait of a religious figure, Saint Louis (King Louis IX), to enable Voiture's daughter to keep it with her when she entered a convent. In depicting their faces, he refused to show a transitory expression, instead capturing the psychological essence of the person. His works can be seen in public buildings, private collections, churches such as Val-de-Gr√¢ce, Sorbonne, Saint Severin, Saint-Merri, Saint- M√©dard and in the Basilica of Notre-Dame du Port in Clermont-Ferrand. Champaigne was prominent enough in his time as to be mentioned in Cyrano de Bergerac in a line by Ragueneau referencing Cyrano: \\"Truly, I should not look to find his portrait By the grave hand of Philippe de Champagne.\\" His pupils were his nephew Jean Baptiste de Champaigne, William Faithorne, Jean Morin, and Nicolas de Plattemontagne.Phillipe de Champaigne in the RKD During his last period Champaigne painted mainly religious subjects and family members.

He is known primarily for his religious paintings depicting monks, nuns, and martyrs, and for his still-lifes. Zurbar√°n gained the nickname \\"Spanish Caravaggio,\\" owing to the forceful use of chiaroscuro in which he excelled. Biography 1633 portrait of Francisco Zumel Zurbar√°n was born in 1598 in Fuente de Cantos, Extremadura; he was baptized on 7 November of that year. His parents were Luis de Zurbar√°n, a haberdasher, and his wife, Isabel M√°rquez. In childhood he set about imitating objects with charcoal. In 1614 his father sent him to Seville to apprentice for three years with Pedro D√≠az de Villanueva, an artist of whom very little is known. Zurbar√°n's first marriage, in 1617, was to Mar√≠a Paet who was nine years older. Mar√≠a died in 1624 after the birth of their third child. In 1625 he married again to wealthy widow Beatriz de Morales. On 17 January, 1626, Zurbar√°n signed a contract with the prior of the Dominican monastery San Pablo el Real in Seville, agreeing to produce 21 paintings within eight months. Fourteen of the paintings depicted the life of Saint Dominic; the others represented Saint Bonaventura, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Saint Dominic, and the four Doctors of the Church. This commission established Zurbar√°n as a painter. On 29 August, 1628, Zurbar√°n was commissioned by the Mercedarians of Seville to produce 22 paintings for the cloister in their monastery. In 1629, the Elders of Seville invited Zurbar√°n to relocate permanently to the city, as his paintings had gained such high reputation that he would increase the reputation of Seville. He accepted the invitation and moved to Seville with his wife Beatriz de Morales, the three children from his first marriage, a relative called Isabel de Zurbar√°n and eight servants. In May 1639 his second wife, Beatriz de Morales, died. Towards 1630 he was appointed painter to Philip IV, and there is a story that on one occasion the sovereign laid his hand on the artist's shoulder, saying \\"Painter to the king, king of painters\\". After 1640 his austere, harsh, hard-edged style was unfavorably compared to the sentimental religiosity of Murillo and Zurbar√°n's reputation declined. Beginning by the late 1630s, Zurbar√°n's workshop produced many paintings for export to South America. On 7 February, 1644, Zurbar√°n married a third time with another wealthy widow, Leonor de Torder. It was only in 1658, late in Zurbar√°n's life, that he moved to Madrid in search of work and renewed his contact with Vel√°zquez. Popular myth has Zurbar√°n dying in poverty, but at his death the value of his estate was about 20,000 reales. Style Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Buenos Aires It is unknown whether Zurbar√°n had the opportunity to see the paintings of Caravaggio, only that his work features a similar use of chiaroscuro and tenebrism (dramatic lighting). The painter thought by some art historians to have had the greatest influence on his characteristically severe compositions was Juan S√°nchez Cot√°n. Polychrome sculpture‚Äîwhich by the time of Zurbar√°n's apprenticeship had reached a level of sophistication in Seville that surpassed that of the local painters‚Äîprovided another important stylistic model for the young artist; the work of Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s is especially close to Zurbar√°n's in spirit. Agnus Dei, c. 1635‚Äì1640, Prado Museum He painted his figures directly from nature, and he made great use of the lay-figure in the study of draperies, in which he was particularly proficient. He had a special gift for white draperies; as a consequence, the houses of the white-robed Carthusians are abundant in his paintings. To these rigid methods, Zurbar√°n is said to have adhered throughout his career, which was prosperous, wholly confined to Spain, and varied by few incidents beyond those of his daily labour. His subjects were mostly severe and ascetic religious vigils, the spirit chastising the flesh into subjection, the compositions often reduced to a single figure. The style is more reserved and chastened than Caravaggio's, the tone of color often quite bluish. Exceptional effects are attained by the precisely finished foregrounds, massed out largely in light and shade. Backgrounds are often featureless and dark. Zurbaran had difficulty painting deep space; when interior or exterior settings are represented, the effect is suggestive of theater backdrops on a shallow stage. Zurbaran's late works, such as the Saint Francis (c. 1658‚Äì1664; Alte Pinakothek) show the influence of Murillo and Titian in their looser brushwork and softer contrasts. Artistic legacy Still Life with Lemons, Oranges and a Rose, 1633, Norton Simon Museum The Flight into Egypt, late 1630s, Seattle Art Museum In 1631 he painted the great altarpiece of The Apotheosis of Saint Thomas Aquinas, now in the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville; it was executed for the church of the college of that saint. This is Zurbar√°n's largest composition, containing figures of Christ, the Madonna, various saints, Charles V with knights, and Archbishop Deza (founder of the college) with monks and servitors, all the principal personages being more than life-size. It had been preceded by numerous pictures for the retable of St. Peter in the cathedral of Seville. Between 1628 and 1634 he painted four scenes from the life of St. Peter Nolasco for the Principal Monastery of the Calced Mercedarians in Seville. In Santa Maria de Guadalupe he painted multiple large pictures, eight of which relate to the history of St. Jerome; and in the church of Saint Paul, Seville, a figure of the Crucified Saviour, in grisaille, creating an illusion of marble. In 1639 he completed the paintings of the high altar of the Carthusians in Jerez. In the palace of Buenretiro, Madrid are four large canvases representing the Labours of Hercules, the only group of mythological subjects from the hand of Zurbar√°n. A fine example of his work is in the National Gallery, London: a whole-length, life-sized figure of a kneeling Saint Francis holding a skull. Jacob and his twelve sons, a series depicting the patriarch Jacob and his 12 sons, is held at Auckland Castle in Bishop Auckland, Co. Durham, England. In 1835, paintings by Zurbar√°n were confiscated from monasteries and displayed in the new Museum of C√°diz. His principal pupils were Bernab√© de Ayala, Juan Caro de Tavira, and the Polanco brothers; others included Ignacio de Ries. Zurbar√°n was the subject of a major exhibition in 1987 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which traveled in 1988 to Galeries nationales du Grand Palais in Paris.

The film stars Christopher Lambert, Diego Abatantuono, Sergio Rubini, and Stefania Rocca. It was screened out of competition at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film tells the story of a virtual reality game designer, Jimi (Christopher Lambert), who discovers that the main character of his game, Solo (Diego Abatantuono), has achieved sentience due to an attack by a computer virus. Asked by his creation (who feels everything the character in the game feels, including multiple deaths) to eliminate its existence, Jimi sets out to erase the game from the server of his employer, Okasama Star, before it's commercially released on Christmas Day, and thus spare Solo further suffering. Jimi has been depressed since his wife Lisa (Emmanuelle Seigner) left him. He decides to make his search for her a part of his quest to delete Solo and the game. Along the way he recruits Lisa's friend Joystick (Sergio Rubini) and tech wizard Naima (Stefania Rocca) to help him avoid suspicious representatives of Okasama Star, who employ increasingly forceful methods to stop him. By the end, Jimi hacks into one of the company's servers. This hack is in the world of virtual reality interpreted as encounters with persons from Jimi's life; the network defends itself by projecting virtual representations of people such as Jimi's father and Lisa. It tries to keep the hacker's mind in the loop of his own memories as it burns the hacker's brain. Jimi manages to pass through the network defence mechanism by freeing his mind, forgetting about life before or after, about bodily feelings, and entering a state of pure concentration where one focuses only on the target (in this case the server with the company's bank account). It is similar to meditation where one tries to concentrate on breathing; people who are able to do this are referred to as angels (they are invisible to the system, can go anywhere they want, and their possibilities are limitless) in the film. In the end, Jimi feels enlightened and at inner peace with himself. He successfully deletes Solo, comes to terms with Lisa's leaving him, and understands why things happened the way they did. He is in the state of Nirvana. Cast Production The director, Gabriele Salvatores, shot the film mainly in the disused Alfa Romeo assembly plant in Portello, Milan. The whole place was converted in this sci-fi set where many ethnic sides of the city are shown. From the Indian to the Japanese to the Chinese, the film moves around the dynamic and the futuristic realms that the future created. Release Nirvana was released on January 24, 1997 in Italy. Dimension Films picked up U.S. distribution rights in March 1997, and the film was dubbed in English and released in early 1998. Reception Margaret Pomeranz of Special Broadcasting Service rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and stated that the film is too serious and not very fun. Alan Jones of RadioTimes rated it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"This stunning cyber-fantasy is rich in design and innovative ideas, and intellectually engages the mind while always remaining enjoyable on the purest pulp levels.\\" Travis Mackenzie Hoover of Exclaim! stated the film is too derivative and has aged poorly. David Rooney of Variety called it \\"a visually impressive, existential sci-fi yarn\\" that is \\"shortchanged by a poorly structured story\\".

It is most commonly known as the Lady Crab. Other names for it include the Leopard Crab or Atlantic Leopard Crab due to the leopard-like rosette patterns on its shell, the Calico Crab (not to be confused with Hepatus epheliticus), or Ocellated Crab. It has a shell long and only slightly wider, which is covered in clusters of purple spots. It occurs from Canada to Georgia, and lives mainly on molluscs, such as the Atlantic surf clam. Description The carapace of O. ocellatus is slightly wider than long, at wide, and long. This distinguishes it from other crabs in the family Portunidae, which often have elongated lateral spines. The carapace is yellow-grey or light purplish, with \\"leopardlike clusters of purple dots\\", and 3‚Äì5 spines along the edge behind each eye. O. ovalipes is almost identical to O. floridanus, which lives in the Gulf of Mexico, but can be separated from the sympatric O. stephensoni by the purple spots, which O. stephensoni lacks. Distribution The distribution of O. ocellatus extends from Canada to Georgia. O. ocellatus is \\"probably the only Ovalipes species common north of Virginia\\", being replaced by Ovalipes stephensoni to the south. Life cycle O. ocellatus has five larval stages, lasting a total of 18 days at and a salinity of 30‚Ä∞, and 26 days at and 30‚Ä∞. Ecology O. ocellatus is a nocturnal predator, which often buries itself in the sand. It has been described as \\"vicious\\" and \\"the crab most likely to pinch a wader's toes\\". It feeds mostly on molluscs, particularly the Atlantic surf clam Spisula solidissima. Taxonomic history O. ocellatus was first described by Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst in 1799, as Cancer ocellatus. In 1898, Mary Jane Rathbun moved the species to her new genus Ovalipes.

It is located in I≈Çawa County on the Sandela River, some southeast of I≈Çawa.  Geographical location  Lubawa is located in Che≈Çmno Land, approximately north-east of the town of Nowe Miasto Lubawskie, south-west of the town of Olsztyn and south-east of the regional centre of Gda≈Ñsk, at an altitude of above sea level. History Remains of the Lubawa Castle In 1214 the local Prussian landlord Surwabuno was christened by Christian of Oliva, the first Catholic bishop of Prussia. The latter is nowadays featured on the coat of arms of Lubawa. The town was first mentioned in a papal bull of January 18, 1216, issued by Pope Innocent III. Soon afterwards a wooden castle was built. Within the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, the Bishopric of Culm was created in 1243 by William of Modena. In 1257 the town became a property of the church and the seat of the bishops of Culm (Che≈Çmno). In 1268 the castle was destroyed. Between 1301 and 1326 a new castle was built of stone by the local bishop named Arnold. In 1330 it was destroyed by an invasion of Lithuanian forces of Gediminas, but was rebuilt. The town of L√∂bau was captured by the Kingdom of Poland after the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 but returned to the Teutonic Order once the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War ended. However the surrounding Land of Lubawa had gone partially to Masovia in the south. Gothic church St. Anna in Lubawa (1330).

The incorporation of the town to Poland was confirmed in the Second Peace of Toru≈Ñ in 1466. It was part of the Che≈Çmno Voivodeship and soon afterwards became a centre of local trade and commerce. As such it became one of the seats of the bishops of Che≈Çmno. In 1533 it was razed to the ground by a great fire mentioned by Erasmus of Rotterdam, but it was soon rebuilt and between 1535 and 1539 Nicolaus Copernicus visited the bishop's castle in Lubawa several times. At that time, the castle also housed an astronomical observatory. It was in Lubawa that the decision was made to publish Copernicus' groundbreaking work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. In 1545 the town and the castle were yet again destroyed by a fire. The town gained significant profits from the trade. In 1627 the castle was refurbished and became a Baroque style palace of Bishop Jan Zadzik. By 1640 construction of water works and sewers had been completed. The town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772 through the First Partition of Poland. Part of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807‚Äì13) during the Napoleonic Wars, the town was again annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia after the dissolution of the duchy. In 1815 the palace was destroyed by a fire and in 1826 its walls were demolished. In 1820 the convent of the Benedictine Confederation was suppressed.Meyers Gro√ües Konversations- Lexikon, 6th edition, Vol. 12, Leipzig and Vienna 1908, p. 641, no 1).

March 16, 2006. From 1946 through 1948, he portrayed the title character on The Crime Files of Flamond on WGN and in syndication. Wallace announced wrestling in Chicago in the late 1940s and early 1950s, sponsored by Tavern Pale beer. In the late 1940s, Wallace was a staff announcer for the CBS radio network. He had displayed his comic skills when he appeared opposite Spike Jones in dialogue routines. He was also the voice of Elgin-American in the company's commercials on Groucho Marx's You Bet Your Life. As Myron Wallace, he portrayed New York City detective Lou Kagel on the short-lived radio drama series Crime on the Waterfront. 1950s‚Äì1967: Television In 1949, Wallace began to move to the new medium of television. In that year, he starred under the name Myron Wallace in a short-lived police drama, Stand By for Crime. Wallace hosted a number of game shows in the 1950s, including The Big Surprise, Who's the Boss? and Who Pays?. Early in his career, Wallace was not known primarily as a news broadcaster. It was not uncommon during that period for newscasters to announce, to deliver commercials and to host game shows; Douglas Edwards, John Daly, John Cameron Swayze and Walter Cronkite hosted game shows as well. Wallace also hosted the pilot episode of Nothing but the Truth, which was helmed by Bud Collyer when it aired under the title To Tell the Truth. Wallace occasionally served as a panelist on To Tell the Truth in the 1950s. He also made commercials for a variety of products, including Procter & Gamble's Fluffo brand shortening. Publicity photo for the television program Mike Wallace Interviews, 1957 Wallace also hosted two late- night interview programs, Night Beat (broadcast in New York City during 1955‚Äì1957, only on DuMont's WABD) and The Mike Wallace Interview on ABC in 1957‚Äì1958. See also Profiles in Courage, section: Authorship controversy. In 1959, Louis Lomax told Wallace about the Nation of Islam. Lomax and Wallace produced a five-part documentary about the organization, The Hate That Hate Produced, which aired during the week of July 13, 1959. The program marked the first time that most white people heard about the Nation, its leader, Elijah Muhammad, and its charismatic spokesman, Malcolm X. By the early 1960s, Wallace's primary income came from commercials for Parliament cigarettes, touting their \\"man's mildness\\" (he had a contract with Philip Morris to pitch their cigarettes as a result of the company's original sponsorship of The Mike Wallace Interview). Between June 1961 and June 1962, he and Joyce Davidson hosted a New York-based nightly interview program for Westinghouse Broadcasting called PM East for one hour; it was paired with the half-hour PM West, which was hosted by San Francisco Chronicle television critic Terrence O'Flaherty. Westinghouse syndicated the series to television stations that it owned and to a few other cities. People in southern and southwestern states and in the metropolitan areas of Chicago and Philadelphia were unable to watch it. A frequent guest on the PM East segment was Barbra Streisand, though only the audio of some of her conversations with Wallace survives, as Westinghouse wiped the videotapes. Also in the early 1960s, Wallace was the host of the David Wolper‚Äìproduced Biography series. After his elder son's death in 1962, Wallace decided to get back into news and hosted an early version of CBS Morning News from 1963 through 1966. In 1964 he interviewed Malcolm X, who, half-jokingly, commented \\"I probably am a dead man already.\\"Rebroadcast on CNN, Larry King Live during an interview with Mike Wallace. The black leader was assassinated a few months later in February 1965. In 1967, Wallace anchored the documentary CBS Reports: The Homosexuals. \\"The average homosexual, if there be such, is promiscuous\\", Wallace said in the piece. \\"He is not interested or capable of a lasting relationship like that of a heterosexual marriage. His sex life, his love life, consists of a series of one-chance encounters at the clubs and bars he inhabits. And even on the streets of the citythe pick-up, the one night stand, these are characteristics of the homosexual relationship.\\" In later years, Wallace came to regret his participation in the episode. \\"I should have known better,\\" he said in 1992. Speaking in 1996, Wallace stated, \\"That isGod help uswhat our understanding was of the homosexual lifestyle a mere twenty-five years ago because nobody was out of the closet and because that's what we heard from doctorsthat's what [psychiatrist Charles] Socarides told us, it was a matter of shame.\\" 1967‚Äì2008: 60 Minutes Wallace and Harry Reasoner on the 60 Minutes premiere, 1968 Wallace's career as the lead reporter on 60 Minutes led to some run-ins with the people interviewed and claims of misconduct by female colleagues. While interviewing Louis Farrakhan, Wallace alleged that Nigeria was the most corrupt country in the world. Farrakhan immediately shot back that Americans were in no moral position to judge, declaring \\"Has Nigeria dropped an atomic bomb that killed people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Have they killed off millions of Native Americans?\\" \\"Can you think of a more corrupt country?\\" asked Wallace. \\"I'm living in one,\\" said Farrakhan. Wallace interviewed General William Westmoreland for the CBS special The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception that aired on January 23, 1982. Westmoreland then sued Wallace and CBS for libel. The trial ended in February 1985 when the case was settled out of court just before it would have gone to the jury. Each side agreed to pay its own costs and attorney fees, and CBS issued a clarification of its intent with respect to the original story. In 1981, Wallace was forced to apologize for a racial slur he had made about blacks and Hispanics. During a break while preparing a 60 Minutes report on a bank that had been accused of duping low-income Californians, Wallace was caught on tape joking that \\"You bet your ass [the contracts are] hard to read if you're reading them over the watermelon or the tacos!\\" Attention was again drawn to that incident several years later when protests were raised after Wallace was selected to deliver a university commencement address during a ceremony within which Nelson Mandela was awarded an honorary doctorate in absentia for his fight against racism. Wallace initially called the protesters' complaint \\"absolute foolishness\\". However, he subsequently apologized for his earlier remark and added that when he had been a student decades earlier on the same university campus, \\"though it had never really caused me any serious difficulty here ... I was keenly aware of being Jewish, and quick to detect slights, real or imagined.... We Jews felt a kind of kinship [with blacks]\\", but \\"Lord knows, we weren't riding the same slave ship.\\" Wallace's reputation has been retrospectively affected by his admission that he had harassed female colleagues at 60 Minutes over many years. \\"Back in the 1970s and ‚Äô80s, 60 Minutes correspondent Mike Wallace was known for putting his hand on the backs of his female CBS News co-workers and unsnapping the clasps on their bras. 'It wasn't a secret. I have done that', Wallace told Rolling Stone magazine in 1991.\\" In 2018, claims of sexual misconduct at 60 Minutes led to the resignation of executive producer Jeff Fager, who had overseen the news show for 36 years. He resigned several months after a July 27 story by Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker. Not only did Farrow's story accuse Fager of ignoring and enabling misconduct by several high-ranking male producers at 60 Minutes, but Farrow also cited former employees who accused Fager himself of misconduct. On March 14, 2006, Wallace announced his retirement from 60 Minutes after 37 years with the program. He continued working for CBS News as a \\"Correspondent Emeritus\\", albeit at a reduced pace.Mike Wallace Retiring From 60 Minutes, Broadcasting & Cable, March 14, 2006. In August 2006, Wallace interviewed Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Wallace's last CBS interview was with retired baseball star Roger Clemens in January 2008 on 60 Minutes. Wallace's previously vigorous health (Morley Safer described him in 2006 as \\"having the energy of a man half his age\\") began to fail, and in June 2008 his son Chris said that his father would not be returning to television. Wallace expressed regret for not having secured an interview with First Lady Pat Nixon. Personal life Wallace in 2007 Wallace had two children with his first wife, Norma Kaphan.Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish By Abigail Pogrebin retrieved March 30, 2013 Wallace's younger son, Chris, is also a journalist. His elder son, Peter, died at age 19 in a mountain-climbing accident in Greece in 1964. From 1949 to 1954, Wallace was married to Patrizia \\"Buff\\" Cobb, an actress and stepdaughter of Gladys Swarthout. The couple hosted the \\"Mike and Buff Show\\" on CBS television in the early 1950s. They also hosted \\"All Around Town\\" in 1951 and 1952. For many years, Wallace unknowingly suffered from depression. In an article that he wrote for Guideposts, Wallace related, \\"I'd had days when I felt blue and it took more of an effort than usual to get through the things I had to do.\\"Mike Wallace, \\"Mike Wallace Battles Depression\\" Guideposts Magazine, January 2002 (republished, 2012) His condition worsened in 1984 after General William Westmoreland filed a $120 million libel lawsuit against Wallace and CBS over statements that were made in the documentary The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception (1982). Westmoreland claimed that the documentary made him appear as if he had manipulated intelligence. The lawsuit, Westmoreland v. CBS, was later dropped after CBS issued a statement explaining they never intended to portray the general as disloyal or unpatriotic. During the proceedings, Wallace was hospitalized with what was diagnosed as exhaustion. His wife Mary forced him to go to a doctor, who diagnosed Wallace with clinical depression. He was prescribed an antidepressant and underwent psychotherapy. Out of a belief that it would be perceived as weakness, Wallace kept his depression a secret until he revealed it in an interview with Bob Costas on Costas' late-night talk show, Later. In a later interview with colleague Morley Safer, he admitted having attempted suicide circa 1986. Wallace received a pacemaker more than 20 years before his death, and underwent triple bypass surgery in January 2008. He lived in a care facility the last several years of his life. In 2011, CNN host Larry King visited him and reported that he was in good spirits, but that his physical condition was noticeably declining. Wallace considered himself a political moderate. He was a friend of Nancy Reagan and her family for over 75 years. Nixon wanted Wallace to be his press secretary. Fox News said, \\"He didn't fit the stereotype of the Eastern liberal journalist.\\" Interviewed by his son on Fox News Sunday, he was asked if he understood why people feel disaffection toward the mainstream media. \\"They think they're wide-eyed commies; liberals,\\" Mike replied, a notion he dismissed as \\"damned foolishness\\". Death Wallace died at his residence in New Canaan, Connecticut, from natural causes on April 7, 2012, at the age of 93. The night after Wallace's death, Morley Safer announced his death on 60 Minutes. On April 15, 2012, a full episode of 60 Minutes aired that was dedicated to remembering Wallace's life. Awards In 1989, Wallace was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Pennsylvania. Wallace's professional honors included 21 Emmy Awards, among them a report just weeks before the September 11 attacks for an investigation on the former Soviet Union's smallpox program and concerns about terrorism. He also won three Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards, three George Foster Peabody Awards, a Robert E. Sherwood Award, a Distinguished Achievement Award from the University of Southern California School of Journalism, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award in the international broadcast category. In September 2003, Wallace received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy, his 20th. Most recently, on October 13, 2007, Wallace was awarded the University of Illinois Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism. * 1991: Paul White Award, Radio Television Digital News Association * 1999: Gerald Loeb Award for Network and Large- Market Television for an investigative piece on the international pharmaceutical industry Fictional portrayals Wallace was played by actor Christopher Plummer in the 1999 feature film The Insider. The screenplay was based on the Vanity Fair article \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" by Marie Brenner, which was about Wallace caving in to corporate pressure to kill a story about Jeffrey Wigand, a whistle-blower trying to expose Brown & Williamson's dangerous business practices. Wallace disliked his on-screen portrayal and maintained that he was in fact very eager to have Wigand's story aired in full. Wallace was played by actor Stephen Rowe in the stage version of Frost/Nixon, but he was omitted from the screenplay of the 2008 film adaptation and thus the movie itself. In the 1999 American broadcast television movie Hugh Hefner: Unauthorized, Wallace is portrayed by Mark Harelik. In the film A Face in the Crowd (1957), Wallace portrayed himself.

One of the main benefits of gettext is that it separates programming from translating. The most commonly used implementation of gettext is GNU gettext, released by the GNU Project in 1995. The runtime library is libintl. gettext provides an option to use different strings for any number of plural forms of nouns, but it has no support for grammatical gender. History Initially, POSIX provided no means of localizing messages. Two proposals were raised in the late 1980s, the 1988 Uniforum gettext and the 1989 X/Open catgets (XPG-3 ¬ß 5). Sun Microsystems implemented the first gettext in 1993. The Unix and POSIX developers never really agreed on what kind of interface to use (the other option is the X/Open catgets), so many C libraries, including glibc, implemented both. , whether gettext should be part of POSIX was still a point of debate in the Austin Group, despite the fact that its old foe has already fallen out of use. Concerns cited included its dependence on the system-set locale (a global variable subject to multithreading problems) and its support for newer C-language extensions involving wide strings. The GNU Project decided that the message-as-key approach of gettext is simpler and more friendly. (Most other systems, including catgets, requires the developer to come up with \\"key\\" names for every string.) They released GNU gettext, a free software implementation of the system in 1995. Gettext, GNU or not, has since been ported to many programming languages. The simplicity of po and widespread editor support even lead to its adoption in non-program contexts for text documents or as an intermediate between other localization formats, with converters like po4a (po for anything) and Translate Toolkit emerging to provide such a bridge. Operation Programming Typical gettext workflow. The de.po instance on the left shows a \\"renewing\\" of translations via msgmerge. The basic interface of gettext is the function, which accepts a string that the user will see in the original language, usually English. To save typing time, and to reduce code clutter, this function is commonly aliased to \`_\`: printf(gettext(\\"My name is %s. \\"), my_name); printf(_(\\"My name is %s. \\"), my_name); // same, but shorter \`gettext()\` then uses the supplied strings as keys for looking up translations, and will return the original string when no translation is available. This is in contrast to POSIX \`catgets()\`, AmigaOS \`GetString()\`, or Microsoft Windows \`LoadString()\` where a programmatic ID (often an integer) is used. To handle the case where the same original- language text can have different meanings, gettext has functions like \`cgettext()\` that accept an additional \\"context\\" string. \`xgettext\` is run on the sources to produce a \`.pot\` (Portable Object Template) file, which contains a list of all the translatable strings extracted from the sources. Comments starting with \`///\` are used to give translators hints, although other prefixes are also configurable to further limit the scope. One such common prefix is \`TRANSLATORS:\`. For example, an input file with a comment might look like: /// TRANSLATORS: %s contains the user's name as specified in Preferences printf(_(\\"My name is %s. \\"), my_name); \`xgettext\` is run using the command: xgettext -c / The resultant .pot file looks like this with the comment (note that xgettext recognizes the string as a C-language printf format string): #. TRANSLATORS: %s contains the user's name as specified in Preferences #, c-format #: src/name.c:36 msgid \\"My name is %s. \\" msgstr \\"\\" In POSIX shell script, gettext provides a \`gettext.sh\` library one can include that provides the many same functions gettext provides in similar languages. GNU bash also has a simplified construct \`$\\"msgid\\"\` for the simple gettext function, although it depends on the C library to provide a \`gettext()\` function. Translating The translator derives a \`.po\` (Portable Object) file from the template using the \`msginit\` program, then fills out the translations. \`msginit\` initializes the translations so, for instance, for a French language translation, the command to run would be: msginit --locale=fr --input=name.pot This will create \`fr.po\`. The translator then edits the resultant file, either by hand or with a translation tool like Poedit, or Emacs with its editing mode for \`.po\` files. An edited entry will look like: #: src/name.c:36 msgid \\"My name is %s. \\" msgstr \\"Je m'appelle %s. \\" Finally, the .po files are compiled with \`msgfmt\` into binary \`.mo\` (Machine Object) files. GNU gettext may use its own file name extension \`.gmo\` on systems with another gettext implementation. These are now ready for distribution with the software package. GNU \`msgfmt\` can also perform some checks relevant to the format string used by the programming language. It also allows for outputting to language-specific formats other than MO. In later phases of the developmental workflow, \`msgmerge\` can be used to \\"update\\" an old translation to a newer template. There is also \`msgunfmt\` for reverse- compiling \`.mo\` files, and many other utilities for batch processing. Running The user, on Unix-type systems, sets the environment variable \`LC_MESSAGES\`, and the program will display strings in the selected language, if there is an \`.mo\` file for it. Users on GNU variants can also use the environment variable \`LANGUAGE\` instead. Its main difference from the Unix variable is that it supports multiple languages, separated with a colon, for fallback.  Plural form  The \`ngettext()\` interface accounts for the count of a noun in the string. As with the convention of \`gettext()\`, it is often aliased to \`N_\` in practical use. Consider the code sample: // parameters: english singular, english plural, integer count printf(ngettext(\\"%d translated message\\", \\"%d translated messages\\", n), n); A header in the \`\\"\\"\` (empty string) entry of the PO file stores some metadata, one of which is the plural form that the language uses, usually specified using a C-style ternary operator. Let's say we want to translate for the Slovene language: msgid \\"\\" msgstr \\"\\" \\"...\\" \\"Language: sl \\" \\"Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=(n%1001 ? 1 : n%1002 ? 2 : n%1003  n%1004 ? 3 : 0); \\" Since now there are four plural forms, the final po would look like: #: src/msgfmt.c:876 #, c-format msgid \\"%d translated message\\" msgid_plural \\"%d translated messages\\" msgstr[0] \\"%d prevedenih sporoƒçil\\" msgstr[1] \\"%d prevedeno sporoƒçilo\\" msgstr[2] \\"%d prevedeni sporoƒçili\\" msgstr[3] \\"%d prevedena sporoƒçila\\" Reference plural rules for languages are provided by the Unicode consortium. msginit also prefills the appropriate rule when creating a file for one specific language. Implementations In addition to C, gettext has the following implementations: C# for both ASP.NET and for WPF, Perl, PHP, Python, Scala, and Node.js. GNU gettext has native support for Objective-C, but there is no support for the Swift programming language yet. A commonly used gettext implementation on these Cocoa platforms is POLocalizedString. The Microsoft Outlook for iOS team also provides a LocalizedStringsKit library with a gettext-like API.

He was born in Pryluky in the Russian Empire (now in Ukraine)Who Was Who in America, With World Notables: 1982‚Äì1985, Vol. VIII (Marquis-Who's Who, 1985), p. 75. and emigrated to the United States in 1920. Chernev was a national master-strength player and was devoted to chess. He wrote that he \\"probably read more about chess, and played more games than any man in history.\\"Arnold Denker; The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories; Hypermodern Press 1995 Chernev's deep love for the game is obvious to any reader of his books. Chess historian Edward Winter commented: :Although Chess Notes items have shown that he sometimes cut corners, he was active at a time when writing and scholarship were not regarded as a natural pairing and when anecdotes and other chestnuts were particularly prevalent. Few were interested in sources. Above all, in the pre-digital age the work of writers in his field was far harder; they could not fill in gaps in their knowledge with press-of-a-button 'research'. ‚Ä¶ : Chernev's output ‚Äî clear, humorous and easy-going ‚Äî gave the impression of effortlessness, but much industry lay behind it all. ‚Ä¶ : Although his prose was often conversational, it was literate and carefully structured, bearing no resemblance to the ultra-casual 'I'm-just-one-of-the-lads' stuff increasingly seen in chess books and magazines since his time. We have also been struck by the scarcity of typographical errors in Chernev's writing throughout his life. He wrote 20 chess books, among them: Chessboard Magic!, The Bright Side of Chess, The Fireside Book of Chess (with Fred Reinfeld), The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played, 1000 Best Short Games of Chess, Practical Chess Endings, Combinations: The Heart of Chess, and Capablanca's Best Chess Endings, the last of these being highly regarded by Edward Winter: :Published by the Oxford University Press in 1978 and reprinted by Dover in 1982, Capablanca's Best Chess Endings by Irving Chernev presents (in full algebraic notation) sixty complete games, annotated with emphasis on the final phase. Well over half are absent from the Golombek volume, a fact which underscores not only the inadequacy of Golombek's selection but also Chernev's readiness to embrace newly-found material. Written with deceptive casualness, Capablanca's Best Chess Endings was, perhaps, Chernev's finest book, combining hard analytical work and his customary screwball levity. Only Chernev could write annotations like (page 169) '‚ÄúDon't simplify against Capablanca!‚Äù, I keep telling them at the office'.Edward Winter's \\"Capablanca Goes Algebraic\\", Chess History, 1997 In 1945, he and Kenneth Harkness wrote An Invitation to Chess, which became one of the most successful chess books ever written, with sales reaching six figures. Perhaps his most famous book is Logical Chess: Move by Move, first released in 1957. This takes 33 classic games from 1889 to 1952, played by masters such as Capablanca; Alekhine; and Tarrasch, and explains them in an instructive manner. An algebraic notation version was published by Batsford in 1998, with minor alterations to the original text. Chernev died in San Francisco in 1981. He was survived by his wife, Selma Kulik, and their son Melvin Chernev.

McCall shot Hickok from behind as he played poker at Nuttal & Mann's Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory on August 2, 1876. McCall was executed for the murder on March 1, 1877. Early life Many details of McCall's life are unknown. He was reportedly born in the early 1850s in Jefferson County, Kentucky. McCall was raised in Kentucky with three sisters and eventually drifted west to become a buffalo hunter.Buffalo hunters; Legends of America online; accessed November 2016 By 1876, he was living in a gold mining camp outside Deadwood, under the alias \\"Bill Sutherland\\".  Murder of Hickok  McCall was intoxicated while drinking alcohol at Nuttal & Mann's saloon in Deadwood, South Dakota Territory, on August 1, 1876, when one of the players dropped out of a poker game that included \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok. The inebriated McCall quickly took his place. McCall proceeded to lose several hands, and was soon out of money. Hickok offered McCall money to buy breakfast and advised him not to play again until he could cover his losses. Though McCall accepted the money, he reportedly felt insulted. The following day on August 2, 1876, another poker game was taking place at the saloon. On this particular evening, Hickok had his back to the door, in contrast to his normal practice of sitting in a corner to protect his back. Among the players at the table (sitting in the corner) was Charles Rich, who refused Hickok's request to switch seats. Hickok reluctantly took the empty seat and joined the game, which was a fatal mistake. A drunken McCall entered the saloon, and ordered a drink from the bar. He proceeded to move down the bar, and stopped a few steps behind Hickok, as if to look at the hand he had been dealt. Not noticing McCall, Hickok said to another player, ‚ÄúThe old duffer ‚Äì he broke me on the hand,‚Äù, which would be his final words. McCall shot Hickok in the back of the head with a single- action .45-caliber revolver, shouting \\"Damn you! Take that!\\" Hickok died instantly. McCall ran out the back door of the saloon and tried to make his escape on a horse, but the saddle was loosened causing McCall to fall off. He was apprehended by several men shortly after. Jack McCall - The Murder of Wild Bill Hickok First trial An impromptu court was called to order with the prosecution, defense, and jury made up of local miners and businessmen. On trial the next day in McDaniel's Theater, McCall claimed his actions were in retribution for Hickok having previously killed his brother in Abilene, Kansas.Black Hills Daily Pioneer Press; Sheldon, C. H.; August 5, 1876. McCall was found not guilty after two hours. The verdict brought the Black Hills Pioneer to editorialize: \\"Should it ever be our misfortune to kill a man... we would simply ask that our trial may take place in some of the mining camps of these hills.\\" Second trial and execution Fearing for his safety, McCall soon left the area and headed into Wyoming Territory, where he repeatedly bragged at local saloons about killing Hickok in a \\"fair\\" gunfight. But Wyoming authorities refused to recognize the result of McCall's acquittal on the grounds that the court in Deadwood had no legal jurisdiction. Because Deadwood was not under a legally constituted law enforcement or court system, officials argued that McCall could be tried for murder again. Agreeing, the federal court in Yankton, Dakota Territory, declared that double jeopardy did not apply, and set a date for a retrial. The trial began on December 4, 1876. No witnesses were called for the defense, and the guilty verdict came in at 10:15 pm on December 6. McCall stated that he had been heavily intoxicated at the time of the murder and did not remember any details of the event. He requested a new trial, as well as claimed that his name was not really Jack McCall, and that he had changed it when he left home as a child. Judge Granville Bennett did not believe his story and sentenced McCall to death by hanging. At 10:15 am on March 1, 1877, McCall was hanged in a public execution in Yankton, at age 24. Aftermath and legacy McCall was buried in Sacred Heart Cemetery in Yankton County, South Dakota, a cemetery which was moved in 1881. When McCall's body was exhumed, it was found to still have the noose around its neck. McCall was the first person to be executed by federal officials in the Dakota Territory. The killing of Hickok and the capture of McCall is reenacted every summer evening (except Sundays) at the Masonic Temple in Deadwood.

It is one of Ireland's premier learned societies and cultural institutions. the RIA has around 600 members, regular members being Irish residents elected in recognition of their academic achievements, and Honorary Members similarly qualified but based abroad; a small number of members are elected in recognition of non-academic contributions to society. The Academy was established in 1785 and granted a royal charter in 1786.Harbison, Peter (2003). \\"Royal Irish Academy\\", in Lalor, Brian (ed) Encyclopaedia of Ireland, Dublin: Gill & Macmillan, pp 948‚Äì949. Meeting Room in Academy House Until the late 19th century the Royal Irish Academy was also the owner of the main national collection of Irish antiquities. It presented its collection of archaeological artefacts and similar items, which included such famous pieces as the Tara Brooch, the Cross of Cong and the Ardagh Chalice to what is now the National Museum of Ireland, but retains its very significant collection of manuscripts including the famous Cathach of Colmcille, the Lebor na hUidre (c. 1100), the later medieval Leabhar Breac, the Book of Ballymote, and the Annals of the Four Masters. Mission statement The Academy defines itself as Ireland's leading body of experts in the sciences and humanities, and its mission statement says \\"The Academy champions Irish academic research. One of it principal roles is to identify and recognise Ireland's world-class researchers. It supports excellent scholarship and promotes awareness of how science and the humanities enrich our lives and benefit society.\\" Work The Academy is an all-island independent forum of peer-elected experts, which draws on Members' expertise to contribute to public debate and policy formation on issues in science, technology and culture. In doing this it aims to bring together academia, government and industry to address issues of mutual interest, and it leads national research projects, particularly in areas relating to Ireland and its heritage. The RIA also represents Irish learning internationally, operates a major research library, and is an academic publisher. Membership Election to Membership of the Royal Irish Academy is a public recognition of academic excellence and is sometimes held to be the highest academic honour in Ireland. Those elected are entitled to use the designation \\"MRIA\\" after their name. The criterion for election to Membership is a significant contribution to scholarly research as shown in the candidate's published academic work. However some of those elected to membership are not academics at all but receive the accolade in recognition of other contributions to society: these include former public servants, philanthropists, leaders in political and business life, and others. Regular membership To be elected to regular membership, a candidate has to be proposed and recommended by five Members, and selection is made by a rotating committee of existing Members, their names not made known outside the Academy. Presently, up to 24 Members are elected each year, equally divided between the sciences and humanities. Membership is open only to those resident in Ireland. Honorary membership Honorary Membership can be awarded to persons who have made outstanding contribution to their academic discipline, but who are normally resident outside the island of Ireland. At least two existing Members must propose and recommend a candidate for Honorary Membership. Honorary members are entitled to use the designation \\"Hon. MRIA\\" after their name. Publishing Initial page from the 9th-century Stowe Missal The Academy is one of the longest-established publishers in Ireland, having commenced in 1787. The Academy currently publishes six journals: √âriu, Irish Studies in International Affairs, Mathematical Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Section C, Irish Journal of Earth Sciences and Biology and Environment . The Academy's research projects also regularly publish the Irish Historic Towns Atlas series, the Documents on Irish Foreign Policy, Focl√≥ir na nua-Ghaeilge, the Dictionary of Medieval Latin from Celtic Sources, and the New Survey of Clare Island. In 2014 the Academy published (in association with Yale University Press) the five-volume Art and Architecture of Ireland. The Academy is committed to publishing work which not only influences scholarship, but also the wider community, for example Flashes of Brilliance by Dick Ahlstrom, and Judging Dev by Diarmaid Ferriter. Both of these publications have been accompanied by either a television or a radio series. Academy committees During the 1950s the Academy began forming national committees, each relating to a specific discipline. Today the main focus of the Academy committees is to serve as a strategic vehicle for the disciplines they represent, and to act as a national forum, providing input into policy, research priorities and issues of public concern, such as climate change. They also organise public outreach activities, such as lectures and public interviews, and award grants for research and travel. The Academy committees are made up of both Members and non-Members, including representatives from universities, research institutions, government agencies and, where appropriate, industry. Science Committees: Climate Change and Environmental Sciences; Engineering and Computer Sciences; Geosciences and Geographical Sciences; Life and Medical Sciences; Physical, Chemical and Mathematical Sciences Humanities and Social Sciences Committees: Ethical, Political, Legal and Philosophical Studies; Historical Studies; Social Sciences; Study of Languages, Literature, Culture and Communication; Coiste L√©ann na Gaeilge, Litr√≠ocht na Gaeilge agus na gCult√∫r Ceilteach. Standing Committees - Standing Committee for Archaeology; Standing Committee for International Affairs; North-South Standing Committee.

Built in c.1750, the building has some fine decorative plasterwork and a handsome meeting room designed in 1854 by Frederick Clarendon and now used for conferences, exhibitions and public talks. The Academy allows the use of these meeting rooms by external bodies when its own activities permit. Academy House was home to many of Ireland's finest national treasures, including the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch, until 1890 when the Academy transferred its collections to the newly established National Museum of Ireland. The Academy Library holds the largest collection of Old Irish manuscripts in the world.Raifeartaigh, T.O. (1985). The Royal Irish Academy: A bicentennial history 1785‚Äì1985.

Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that, in a criminal proceeding in federal court, a defendant who does not alert the district court to a possible violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure must show on appeal that the violation affirmatively affected his rights in order to obtain reversal of his conviction by guilty plea. Rule 11, which pertains to criminal prosecutions in United States federal courts only, governs the offering of plea bargains to criminal defendants and the procedures district courts must employ to ensure that the defendant knows of and properly waives his trial- related constitutional rights. In Benitez, the trial court violated Rule 11 when it took the defendant's plea by failing to warn him that the plea could not be withdrawn if the court did not accept the prosecution's sentencing recommendations. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction, considering that the non-English speaking defendant did not understand his rights under those circumstances. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, ruling the Court of Appeals had applied the wrong test by not requiring the defendant to show how the error actually prejudiced the proceedings. The Court of Appeals had consequently failed to consider the entire record regarding what the defendant understood. An eight-justice majority of the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice David Souter, held that a defendant attempting to reverse his conviction due to a Rule 11 violation must show a reasonable probability that, but for the trial court's error, he would not have entered the plea. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in the judgment but disagreed with the majority's standard. Background of the case Arrest and indictment Carlos Dominguez Benitez arranged to sell several pounds of methamphetamine to an informant secretly working with law enforcement. Benitez was arrested while making the sale, confessed, and gave information on his supplier and fellow drug dealers. Benitez was then indicted by a federal grand jury under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 for conspiracy to possess more than of a methamphetamine mixture, and for possession of of a methamphetamine mixture, both with intent to distribute.21 U.S.C. ¬ß 841(b)(1)(A) and 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 846, respectively. Under the statutory sentencing ranges, Benitez faced anywhere from ten years to life in prison, and his court-appointed counsel began discussing a plea bargain while he faced trial before the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Plea agreement and District Court sentencing Benitez, who could only speak and write in Spanish, sent several letters to the District Court, in which he expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney and the plea agreement he was being encouraged to sign. During a hearing, however, Benitez expressed that he did not want to go to trial but just wanted a better deal, and the court declined to make any change. Benitez and the federal prosecutor subsequently agreed that he would plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for the possession charge being dropped, and that the prosecutor would stipulate to a \\"safety valve\\" that would allow him to avoid the statutory ten year minimum sentence, provided he could meet the statutory conditions.18 U.S.C. ¬ß 3553(f), which states a court shall impose a sentence in accordance with the applicable guidelines without regard to any statutory mandatory minimum if the defendant meets five criteria: (1) the defendant does not have more than one criminal history point, as defined under the United States Sentencing Guidelines; (2) the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon; (3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury; (4) the defendant was not the organizer, leader, manager or supervisor of others and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; and (5) the defendant has truthfully provided the government all information the defendant has concerning the offense(s) that were part of the same course of conduct. Benitez was warned in discussion with the prosecutor and in the written plea agreement that the agreement was not binding on the District Court, and that Benitez would not be able to withdraw his guilty plea if the court rejected the prosecutor's recommendations. However, at the hearing the next day when Benitez entered his guilty plea, District Court judge Alicemarie H. Stotler failed to deliver the warning required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(3)(B)Numbered at Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(2) at the time of Benitez' conviction; the rule was subsequently renumbered and the Supreme Court's opinion used the new numbering. that he would not be able to withdraw his plea. Benitez' earlier criminal convictions under a different name were subsequently discovered, which rendered him ineligible for the \\"safety valve.\\" He was then sentenced to the statutory minimum of ten years in prison over his objection that he was never told what the conditions of the \\"safety valve\\" sentence reduction were. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision Benitez appealed his conviction and sentencing to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the District Court's failure to comply with all of the required Rule 11 warnings was ground for reversal. A three- judge panel of the court consisting of Circuit Judges James R. Browning, Stephen Reinhardt, and Richard C. Tallman voted 2-1 to reverse his conviction and sentence.United States v. Benitez, 310 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2002). The court's opinion was written by Judge Browning, and the dissent by Judge Tallman. Because Benitez did not object to the District Court's failure prior to his conviction, the error was not preserved for appeal and so was reviewed under the plain error standard of Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), pursuant to the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55 (2002). The Court of Appeals applied a two part test to determine whether plain error had been committed. First, the defendant had to establish that the court's error was not \\"merely minor or technical.\\" The court considered this satisfied by the inherently serious nature of a Rule 11 violation alone, because the rule was intended to ensure that a defendant's plea was made intelligently and knowingly. Second, the defendant had to establish that he did not understand the rights at issue when he entered his guilty plea. The court found that this second element was satisfied because Benitez' language barrier had prevented him from gaining a full understanding of his rights from only the written plea agreement and other comments made by the court. Judge Tallman's dissent argued that Vonn required the court to view the proceedings as a whole in determining whether the Rule 11 violation constituted plain error. He believed that although the record showed that the Rule 11 \\"magic words\\" may not have been spoken, Benitez' counsel and the District Court had fully discussed the plea agreement with him, and that he had expressed understanding of all the relevant issues. The court's decision The Supreme Court granted review on the narrow issue of on what basis a court's failure to comply with Rule 11 constitutes reversible error, and unanimously reversed.Dan Himmelfarb, Assistant to the Solicitor General, argued the case on behalf of the United States. Myra D. Mossman, a solo practitioner from Santa Barbara, California, argued for Benitez on appointment by the Supreme Court. Justice David Souter wrote the majority opinion, which seven Justices joined. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment. The Court stated that even for preserved errors, only those that structurally \\"undermine the fairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole\\" require reversal without a consideration of the effect the error had on the proceeding. The omission of a Rule 11 warning alone does not fall into this category. Furthermore, the Rule 52 phrase \\"error that affects substantial rights,\\" which is used in Rule 52, \\"has previously been taken to mean error with a prejudicial effect on the outcome of a judicial proceeding.\\" The Court concluded by holding that \\"a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\\" The Court explained that a reasonable probability is one that is \\"sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\\" of the proceeding.This statement, and the standard itself, were imported from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), which established the standard for showing reversible prejudice in ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the Sixth Amendment. In the Court's view--essentially the same as Judge Tallman's --the Court of Appeals' standard failed because it did not consider record evidence that tended to show that any misunderstanding was inconsequential, or what the relative significance of the factors involved in Benitez' plea decision were regardless of the Rule 11 error. The Court acknowledged that the standard it imposed would be very rarely met, but that it was still easier than if the defendant had to prove the claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Though the Supreme Court did not explicitly decide whether Benitez met the proper standard, its opinion nonetheless proceeded with an unfavorable analysis of his case. The Court believed that his statements in the record showed that he may have been confused about the substantive law of the safety valve provision, but not that there was a \\"causal link\\" between his confusion and the Rule 11 violation. The strength of the government's case was also a factor, and the Court did not think that the proper Rule 11 warning would have changed his \\"assessment of his strategic position.\\" This was especially true because the written plea agreement included the warning that it would be irrevocable, and it had been read to him in Spanish. The Court accordingly reversed the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case. Scalia's concurrence In a short separate opinion, Justice Scalia expressed agreement with much of the Court's analysis, but disagreed with the standard of probability the Court required the defendant to meet. Scalia listed four different standards that the Court had adopted in different contexts to prove what would have happened in a trial absent error, and stated that these \\"ineffable gradations of probability\\" confused judicial reasoning more than aided it. He wrote that a court could only achieve the precision of two standards--beyond a reasonable doubt, and by a preponderance of the evidence-- and that the latter should apply to the claim at issue. Subsequent developments Upon remand from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals affirmed Benitez' conviction and sentencing in a per curiam, summary opinion.United States v. Benitez, 381 F.3d 859 (9th Cir. 2004).

The group included John and Rob Wright and Tom Holliston, all members of the punk rock band Nomeansno. The Hanson Brothers' band name references characters in the cult ice hockey film Slap Shot. History From 1984 to 1989, the Wright brothers and original NoMeansNo guitarist Andy Kerr performed Ramones cover sets sporadically under the name The Hanson Brothers. The Hanson Brothers later began to write \\"their own Ramones songs\\". At this time John Wright played drums and the three members shared lead vocal duties. Examples of songs from this era are \\"Ya Little Creep\\" and \\"Bad,\\" two Kerr-era NoMeansNo songs with songwriting credited to the Hanson Brothers; the former appears on the 1991 compilation Clam Chowder and Ice Vs. Big Macs and Bombers, and the latter on The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy, a collaborative LP with Jello Biafra. The Wrights began working with Holliston as the Hanson Brothers in 1989. The earliest sessions from this time still featured John Wright on drums; however, Ken Jensen of D.O.A. soon joined and, after releasing a debut 7\\", the band recorded their first album, Gross Misconduct, in 1992. The album featured art spoofing the cover of the Ramones' Road to Ruin. Jensen died in a house fire in 1995. Ken Kempster (member of, among many other groups, the Showbusiness Giants) became the group's next drummer, referred to as \\"Kenny Jr\\" Hanson. This lineup released the group's second record, Sudden Death, through a subsidiary of Virgin Records. The cover spoofed D.O.A.'s \\"The Prisoner\\" single cover. In 2000, the songs \\"Rink Rat\\", \\"Third Man In\\", \\"Stick Boy\\", and \\"Danielle\\", were featured in the NHL Rock The Rink game for the Sony PlayStation. Also in 2000, John Wright, in his Johnny Hanson character, recorded an instructional video regarding homebrewing beer. Wright also compiled and released two compilations of hockey-themed songs called Puck Rock Volumes I and II. Kempster left the group in 2001, and Ernie Hawkins joined for touring behind the group's third record, My Game. The cover parodied Black Flag's My War.

Classified advertising is a form of advertising which is particularly common in newspapers, online and other periodicals which may be sold or distributed free of charge. Classified advertisements are much cheaper than larger display advertisements used by businesses, although display advertising is more widespread. They were also commonly called \\"want\\" ads, starting in 1763.  Newspaper classifieds  Advertisements in a newspaper are typically short, as they are charged for by the line or word, and are one newspaper column wide. Publications printing news or other information often have sections of classified advertisements; there are also publications that contain only advertisements. The advertisements are grouped into categories or classes such as \\"for sale‚Äîtelephones\\", \\"wanted‚Äîkitchen appliances\\", and \\"services‚Äîplumbing\\", hence the term \\"classified\\". Classified ads generally fall into two types: individuals advertising sales of their personal goods, and advertisements by local businesses. Some businesses use classified ads to hire new employees. One issue with newspaper classified advertising is that it does not allow images, even though display ads, which do allow images, can be found in the classified section.  Developments  In recent years the term \\"classified advertising\\" or \\"classified ads\\" has expanded from merely the sense of print advertisements in periodicals to include similar types of advertising on computer services, radio, and even television, particularly cable television but occasionally broadcast television as well, with the latter occurring typically very early in the morning hours. Like most forms of printed media, the classified ad has found its way to the Internet, as newspapers have taken their classified ads online and new groups have discovered the benefits of classified advertising. Internet classified ads do not typically use per-line pricing models, so they tend to be longer. They are also searchable, unlike printed material, tend to be local, and may foster a greater sense of urgency as a result of their daily structure and wider scope for audiences. Because of their self-regulatory nature and low cost structures, some companies offer free classifieds internationally. Other companies focus mainly on their local hometown region, while others blanket urban areas by using postal codes. Craigslist.org was one of the first online classified sites, and has grown to become the largest classified source, bringing in over 14 million unique visitors a month according to Comscore Media Metrix. A growing number of sites and companies have begun to provide specialized classified marketplaces online, catering to niche market products and services, such include boats, pianos, pets, and adult services, amongst others. In many cases, these specialized services provide better and more targeted search capabilities than general search engines or general classified services can provide. A number of online services called aggregators crawl and aggregate classifieds from sources such as blogs and RSS feeds, as opposed to relying on manually submitted listings. Additionally, other companies provide online advertising services and tools to assist members in designing online ads using professional ad templates and then automatically distributing the finished ads to the various online ad directories as part of their service. In this sense these companies act as both an application service provider and a content delivery platform. Social classifieds is a growing niche.  Statistics  In 2003 the market for classified ads in the United States was $15.9 billion (newspapers), $14.1 billion (online) according to market researcher Classified Intelligence. The worldwide market for classified ads in 2003 was estimated at over $100 billion. Perhaps due to the lack of a standard for reporting, market statistics vary concerning the total market for internet classified ads. The Kelsey Research Group listed online classified ads as being worth $13.3 billion, while Jupiter Research provided a conservative appraisal of $2.6 billion and the Interactive Advertising Bureau listed the net worth of online classified revenue at $2.1 billion . Newspaper's revenue from classifieds advertisements is decreasing continually as internet classifieds grow. Classified advertising at some of the larger newspaper chains dropped by 14% to 20% in 2007, while traffic to classified sites grew by 23%. As the online classified advertising sector develops, there is an increasing emphasis toward specialization. Vertical markets for classifieds are developing quickly along with the general marketplace for classifieds websites. Like search engines, classified websites are often specialized, with sites providing advertising platforms for niche markets of buyers or sellers.

He published approximately 80 fiction and nonfiction books in Hebrew, some of which are published in translation internationally.  Biography  Shlomo Kalo was born on 25 February 1928, in Sofia, Bulgaria. At the age of 12, Kalo joined the anti-Fascist underground in Bulgaria. Aged 15, when Bulgaria was under Nazi occupation, Kalo was imprisoned in an improvised concentration camp in Somovit.\\",biographical details of early years from: Kalo, Shlomo. Athar. D.A.T. Publications, 2009 (English edition), an autobiographic novel. Aged 18, in 1946, he won a prize in a poetry competition and went to Prague, where he studied medicine at the Charles University, worked as a freelance journalist and wrote short stories. When the state of Israel was founded in 1948, Shlomo Kalo joined the Mahal (\\"Volunteers from abroad\\": individuals outside Israel who volunteered to fight together with the Israeli forces in its war of independence) and was trained as a pilot in Olomouc, Czechoslovakia. In 1949, at the age of 21 he immigrated to Israel. In 1958 he got his M.Sc. in microbiology at the Tel Aviv University. For 26 years till his retirement (in 1988) he worked as director of the medical laboratories of Kupat Holim Klalit health services, in Rishon-leZion. His first book in Hebrew, a collection of short stories, was published in 1954 by \\"Sifriyat ha-Poalim\\". In 1969, a sharp turn in his life occurred (described in the last pages of his autobiographic novel \\"Erral\\"). It affected his life, thoughts and literary activity ever since. Kalo wrote about it: \\"First Sunday of the year 1969 AD, twelve noon. Body tensed like a bow-string. Not he. Warmth rising from the region of the heart. Not he. He stopped being what he was. He will no longer be as he was, forever and ever, for all eternity. He was, he is, he will be, forever and ever, for all eternity.\\"Kalo, Shlomo. Erral. D.A.T. Publications, 2006 (English edition), p. 197. This book is a source for biographical details of adulthood years In 1979 an informal group known as \\"DAAT\\" (Hebrew acronym, meaning knowledge, standing for \\"know yourself always\\") formed around Shlomo Kalo. This group had a varying number of members or supporters till it disbanded in 2009. Some well-known and influential journalists and artists (Shlomo Bar-Abba, Odetta Schwartz and Rivka Zohar, for example) were associated at times with the group. Kalo's many books influenced people who had never met him. In 2009, the Israeli Newspaper Ha'aretz reported that rumours were persistent that Shlomo Kalo was among few Israeli writers who had been shortlisted as candidates for the Nobel Prize for Literature, \\"Haaretz\\" newspaper, English internet site similar reports were made by other news sites in 2010 Jewish Literary Review, Oct. 7, 2010 and in 2011.\\"Yediot Aharonot\\" newspaper, Oct. 2, 2011 page 14 Shlomo Kalo was married to Rivka Zohar-Kalo, a prominent Israeli singer, who performs and records, among others, songs he has written (music and lyrics). A list of Shlomo Kalo's songs performed by Rivka Zohar at \\"shironet\\", Israeli songs & music database site. Shlomo Kalo died at his home on August 30, Shabbat morning. His wife said on a Channel 2 TV interview The \\"Medabrim Al Zeh\\" talk-show on September 1, 2014. that his summarizing last words were: \\"Everything is excellent to the one who is not subjugated\\".  Literary activity  In the 1960s two other works of his were published by \\"Am Oved\\" and won great appreciation. In 1969 he established a publishing house named \\"DAAT Publications\\", from which he retired after a few years, though he continued to publish most of his following titles there. During the 1970s he translated into Hebrew classical writings of Far-Eastern schools such as: Patanjeli's Yoga verses, The Bhagavadgita, Budha's Dhamapada, Tao-Te-Ching and others. During these years and later in the 1980s Kalo published several nonfiction titles dealing with philosophical, moral and spiritual topics (two out of his seven volumes of lectures were published in this decade). Some other titles were literary fiction about a philosophical issue (\\"The Self as Fighter\\", \\"The Gospel of the Absolute Free Will\\" and the novel \\"Like the Scarlet Thread\\"). A lot of his music and songs were written in this period. During the following two decades Kalo continued to write prolifically in a variety of genres and styles. In the 1990s his first titles written in a newly introduced genre (the so-called \\"documented\\" stories) were published: \\"Forevermore\\" and \\"Moments of Truth\\", as well as his best-selling historical novel title \\"The Chosen\\", printed in first edition. During these two decades translation rights of some of his books were sold over in 17 countries. Short stories written by Shlomo Kalo were published in literary magazines in Israel, among them literary supplements of large newspapers. Some of his stories were included in various anthologies celebrating Israel's Jubilee year and other occasions.http://www.shats.com/maamarim/antology.htm . Shamush, Amnon (editor) 50 Writers Choose a Story (Hebrew), 1998 Prof. Gershon Shaked (Hebrew University) maintains in his Modern Fiction study (Indiana University, 2000; p 102-3) that Kalo's book \\"The Heap\\" marked 'two turning points in Hebrew Literary History; the beginning of modernist fiction in Israel, and the advent of Sephardi and Ashkenazi authors who wrote about the immigrant Sephardic community'. \\"The Heap,\\" prof. Shaked continues, \\"has a special place in the history of Hebrew fiction because it is a neo-modernist social protest of an immigrant author\\". The novel is built around a number of immigrants who, reflecting their existential crisis, 'embody the archetype of human failure'. Some 40 out of Kalo's 80 titles were published during the years 2000‚Äì2011.  Other activities  1988 was the year when the extensive media exposure of Shlomo Kalo's contemplative and spiritual lifework began. Since that time, messages and solutions to a variety of issues have been both aired by national TV and radio channels, and widely covered by the press.The highest rating of which: news article in the only TV Channel about his new novel \\"The Chosen\\", 1994-12-30; Portraits in weekend issues of \\"Hadashot\\", \\"Maariv\\" and \\"Yidiot\\" newspaper, etc.. Few years later, Kalo broke all ties with the media and almost always refused to interview requests saying his words and ideas were mistakenly quoted by the media. During the Kosovo Crisis in 1999 Shlomo Kalo was the most prominent Israeli intellectual who publicly protested against US and NATO military attacks on Yugoslavia.Westi newspaper published Kalo's manifest As a Human being and as a Jew, 1999-6-13, and covered public activities he initiated or took place in. Kalo was never involved in any academic activity outside his M.Sc studies. Some of his nonfiction works nevertheless are listed in syllabi of various courses in social sciences and humanities in Israeli universities.

D. (June 29, 1924 ‚Äì April 27, 2004) was a professor of pathology at University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, a leading advocate of calorie restriction for life extension and health improvement, and a crew member of Biosphere 2. Career highlights Walford is credited with significantly furthering aging research by his discovery that laboratory mice, when fed a diet that restricted their caloric intake by 50% yet maintaining nutritional requirements, almost doubled their expected life span. He received his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1948. He completed his internship at Gorgas Hospital, Panama, and served his residency at the V.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. He then served two years in the US Air Force during the Korean War. Walford joined the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1954. He became a Professor of Pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine in 1966. He became Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emeritus, for UCLA, when he left to join the crew of Biosphere 2 in 1991. While at UCLA, Walford served in the following roles: * Director of the Blood Bank and of the Hematology Division of the Clinical Laboratories (1959‚Äì1980) * Director of the School of Medical Technology (1962‚Äì1972) * Chairman of the Vivarium Committee (1965‚Äì1968) In addition to his service at UCLA, he was an expert advisor in immunology for the World Health Organization from 1969 to 1984, was a senatorial delegate to the White House Conference on Aging in 1981, and a member of the National Institute on Aging. His honors and awards include: * Levine Award of the American Society of Clinical Pathology * Research Award of the American Aging Association * Kleemeier Award from the Gerontological Society of America * Henderson Award from the American Geriatrics Society * 1998 Longevity Prize of the Foundation IPSEN * The Senator Alan Cranston Award * Infinity Award of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine * Asteroid #4629 was named after him by its discoverer (E. Helene) in 1986 Walford and his work were featured in print in dozens of articles in popular publications such as Omni, Discover, and Scientific American. During his life he also made dozens of featured appearances on various television shows. Roulette winnings In 1947, while on vacation during medical school, Walford and Albert Hibbs, a mathematics graduate student, used statistical analysis of biased roulette wheels to \\"break the bank\\" in Reno. They tracked the results of the spins, determined which wheels were biased, and then bet heavily on the ones which were unbalanced. The casinos eventually realized that Walford and his friend knew what they were doing and threw them out. A Life Magazine photographer captured the pair drinking milk and counting their chips in a photograph published in the December 8, 1947 issue. Their methods were also mentioned in the roulette book The Eudaemonic Pie by Thomas Bass. Different sources have the pair winning anywhere from $6,500 to $42,000. The high end is more likely, as Walford was reputed to have paid for part of his medical school education and a house from his winnings. The pair also bought a yacht and sailed the Caribbean for over a year. Gerontix In 1981, Walford began a commercial collaboration with fellow researchers Richard Weindruch and Kathleen Yankee Hall, and her husband William Hall, a wealthy businessman. In her tribute after his death, Kathleen Hall wrote of Walford, \\"we both threw in a few thousand dollars and started a small business together.\\"Definition of a Mentor, by Kathleen Hall. https://web.archive.org/web/20161230001503/http://www.walford.com/html/khall.html. Accessed July 21, 2013. Incorporated in California as Gerontix, the company was to sell supplements intended to improve health and increase life span. The first Gerontix product was butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), with lysine and zinc, which was sold in capsules and marketed as a treatment for herpes. Motivated by the success of the bestselling book Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach, by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw, the group intended to sell a package of products, called MaxiLife, which would capitalize on the release of Walford's book, Maximum Life Span. It was expected that Walford, a highly publicized researcher, would experience the same success as Pearson and Shaw. Before Walford's book was published and Gerontix started to manufacture its coordinated products, the manufacturer Twin Laboratories (Twinlab) began to sell a multi-ingredient supplement called MaxiLIFE, which the owners of Gerontix discovered in November 1982. Despite the potential for trademark conflict, the Gerontix group elected to proceed with plans to use the brand name MaxiLife. Twin Laboratories brought suit against Gerontix for trademark infringement, and the court issued a summary judgement in favor of Twin Laboratories on February 13, 1984. Before the resolution of the lawsuit, the Gerontix MaxiLife products were brought to market and sold poorly, partly because of the lackluster sales of Walford's book. Lack of success in federal court and in health food stores led to the demise of Gerontix. Gerontix subsequently brought suit for legal malpractice against the attorneys whom Gerontix had hired to obtain the trademark right to the name MaxiLife, but on February 17, 1989 a summary judgement against Gerontix was entered by Los Angeles Superior Court judge Loren Miller, jr. Gerontix eventually appealed the case to the California Supreme Court after losing an appeal in the California Court of Appeals. In Appendix B of Walford's Maximum Life Span he noted, \\"Additional additives, such as antioxidants and some of the other materials I've listed in Chapters 7 and 8, can be obtained from Gerontix Biological Research Products...,\\" but he did not disclose that he would profit from the sale of Gerontix products. The company's MaxiLife product brochure, which refers to Walford and his research, also makes no mention of his connection to Gerontix. Biosphere 2 Walford was one of the eight ‚Äúcrew members‚Äù who were sealed inside Biosphere 2 where they lived from September 26, 1991 to September 26, 1993. Walford served as the crew's physician. During his stay in Biosphere 2, the crew found that they could not grow as much food as anticipated, so Walford convinced the crew to follow his calorie restriction diet. In November of the first year the crew decided to open a cache of emergency food supplies grown outside of the bubble to supplement their meager diets.The Human Experiment: Two Years and Twenty Minutes Inside Bisophere 2. Poynter, p. 247. Life's end At age 79, Roy Walford died of respiratory failure as a complication of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. According to Walford's friend and colleague, Kathleen Hall, his diagnosis of ALS came as a result of her urging him to see a physician when she noticed \\"the strangeness in Roy's gait.\\" She says that before his death Walford \\"continued writing, taking courses on film production. He had me all over New York and in Dallas for just the right production shots.\\" Meanwhile, Hall remembers that \\"Roy and I together with his daughter, Lisa, and his friends exhausted all the literature, looking for a cure, a solution. I found myself scouting the alleys of Chinatown in New York searching out a particular mushroom, looking for the best grass to help him through the pain.\\" Even before developing ALS, Walford was no stranger to \\"grass.\\" In his book Eternity Soup: Inside the Quest to End Aging, Greg Critser says that Walford's \\"consumption of marijuana was legendary.\\" Walford was survived by his three children, Peter, Morgan, and Lisa Walford. Their mother was Martha Sylvia Schwalb, to whom Walford was married for 20 years before divorcing in the 1970s. Caloric restriction and ALS Walford's death from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has provoked consideration about whether his practice of caloric restriction (CR) may have contributed to, or accelerated, his development of the disease. Research on a transgenic mouse model of ALS demonstrates that CR may hasten the onset of death in ALS. Hamadeh et al. therefore concluded, \\"These results suggest that CR diet is not a protective strategy for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hence is contraindicated.\\" Hamadeh et al. also note two human studies that show \\"low energy intake correlates with death in people with ALS.\\" However, in the first study, Slowie, Paige, and Antel state, \\"The reduction in energy intake by ALS patients did not correlate with the proximity of death but rather was a consistent aspect of the illness.\\" They conclude, \\"ALS patients have a chronically deficient intake of energy and recommended augmentation of energy intake.\\" Previously, Pedersen and Mattson found that in the ALS mouse model, CR \\"accelerates the clinical course\\" of the disease and had no benefits. Suggesting that a calorically dense diet may slow ALS, a ketogenic diet in the ALS mouse model has been shown to slow the progress of disease. More recently, Mattson et al. opine that the death by ALS of Roy Walford, a pioneer in CR research and its antiaging effects, may have been a result of his own practice of CR. However, as Mattson et al. acknowledge, Walford's single case is insufficient to establish the proposed a cause-effect relation. Walford himself speculated that his disease may have been caused by the combination of chronic hypoxia and exposure to carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide in Biosphere 2. Published works Walford authored several books, and set out his dietary beliefs in the bestseller Beyond the 120-Year Diet. In addition, he published at least 340 scientific papers, mainly focused on the biology of aging.

The program airs documentaries, many of which have won awards, about important or interesting events and people in American history. The series premiered on October 4, 1988 and was originally titled The American Experience, but the article \\"The\\" was dropped during a later rebrand and image update. The show has had a presence on the Internet since 1995, and more than 100 American Experience programs are accompanied by their own internet websites, which have more background information on the subjects covered as well as teachers' guides and educational companion materials. The show is produced primarily by WGBH-TV in Boston, Massachusetts, though occasionally in the early seasons of the show, it was co-produced by other PBS stations such as WNET (Channel 13) in New York City. Some programs now considered part of the American Experience collection were produced prior to the creation of the series. Vietnam: A Television History was one of them, airing originally in 1983 after taking six years to assemble. Also, in 2006, American Experience rebroadcast Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, the first half of the award-winning 1986 documentary series about the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s.

This parasite affects the animal gastrointestinal tract in order to give to their offspring an alimentary source. Although not deadly, due to the usual low larva population that infests the animal, large larva populations can cause health issues to the host. For example, a typical horse can tolerate a hundred larvae without any effects. Species There are six species of Gasterophilus: * G. haemorrhoidalis (lip botfly) ‚Äì ranges worldwide and primarily infects horses, mules, donkey and reindeer * G. inermis ‚Äì an Old World species that infects horses, donkeys and zebra * G. intestinalis (horse botfly) ‚Äì ranges worldwide and primarily infects horses, mules and donkeys * G. nasalis (throat botfly) ‚Äì especially Holarctic but ranges worldwide, primarily infects sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, zebra and sometimes cattle * G. nigricornis (broad-bellied horse bot) ‚Äì ranges from the Middle East to China, infects duodenum of horses and donkeys * G. pecorum (dark-winged horse bot) ‚Äì the most pathogenic species in the genus. Ranges through the Old World and infects the mouth, tongue, esophagus and stomach of horses, donkeys and zebras  Taxonomy   Larva  In the third larval stage, the larvae have a length that can go from 1.27cm to 1.91 cm. They have a hooked mouthpart that allows them to attach into the gastrointestinal tract of the infected animal and a rounded body that is covered with spines in rows, of which quantity varies from different species. After this stage, the larva is excreted with the animal feces in the form of a pupa.  Adult  The adults have a length that can be between 1.67 and 1.91 cm. During this phase they look similar to drone bumble bees; They have developed a pair of wings with brown patches and a body that is covered with yellow and black hairs. Looking into the different species, G. haemorrhoidalis and G. nasalis can be identified because they have two rows of spikes on the ventral surface of the larval segments. G. intestinalis, on the other hand, has mouthparts that are not uniformly curved dorsally and the body spikes present have blunt-ended tips.  Life cycle  The first stage: During the summer months, the full-grown Gasterophilus lays the eggs over the hair, face, and extremities of their future host (these eggs are laid on different portions of the body according to the various Gasterophilus species). Due to the animal grooming that starts after seven days from the egg being layed, the hatched larvae end up in the host mouth and tongue where they get attached for more than a month before being ingested. During this process, the animal can suffer from inflammation of the oral mucosa. The second stage: In this stage, the larvae have been ingested and are now in the gastrointestinal tract of the host where they attach themselves. Here, they mature and stay there from eight to nine months to pass the winter and are released in the spring. During this phase, the infection can manifest in the host's digestive system resulting in gastritis or ulceration, which may result in perforations in the walls of the tract in severe cases and much more. The third stage: The larvae are mature enough to develop their pupa, and once finished they are released with the animal feces during spring. After leaving, which occurs in about 3-10 weeks,(depending on the temperature) the adult bot fly emerges from the pupa and starts the cycle again.  Treatment  The most efficient way known to avoid the infection of Gasterophilus is by parasitizing the animals with products like trichlorphon and dichlorvos, by using hot water to scrub the areas where the eggs are laid to kill the larvae, and by cleaning the areas where the feces of the infected animal had been in order to avoid the adult formation.

In his 1955 William James lecture series, which were later published under the title How to Do Things with Words, J. L. Austin argued against a positivist philosophical claim that the utterances always \\"describe\\" or \\"constate\\" something and are thus always true or false. After mentioning several examples of sentences which are not so used, and not truth-evaluable (among them nonsensical sentences, interrogatives, directives and \\"ethical\\" propositions), he introduces \\"performative\\" sentences or illocutionary act as another instance.Austin, J.L. How to Do Things with Words Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. Austin's definition In order to define performatives, Austin refers to those sentences which conform to the old prejudice in that they are used to describe or constate something, and which thus are true or false; and he calls such sentences \\"constatives\\". In contrast to them, Austin defines \\"performatives\\" as follows: *(1) Performative utterances are not true or false, that is, not truth-evaluable; instead when something is wrong with them then they are \\"unhappy\\", while if nothing is wrong they are \\"happy\\". *(2) The uttering of a performative is, or is part of, the doing of a certain kind of action (Austin later deals with them under the name illocutionary acts), the performance of which, again, would not normally be described as just \\"saying\\" or \\"describing\\" something (cf. Austin 1962, 5). For example, when Paul says \\"I promise to do the dishes\\" in an appropriate context then he thereby does not just say something, and in particular he does not describe what he is doing; rather, in making the utterance he performs the promise; since promising is an illocutionary act, the utterance is thus a performative utterance. If Peter utters the sentence without the intention to keep the promise, or if eventually he does not keep it, then although something is not in order with the utterance, the problem is not that the sentence is false: it is rather \\"unhappy\\", or \\"infelicitous\\", as Austin also says in his discussion of so-called felicity conditions. In the absence of any such flaw, on the other hand, the utterance is to be assessed as \\"happy\\" or \\"felicitous\\", rather than as \\"true\\". Austin dropped this distinction in favour of a distinction between explicit performatives (\\"I promise it will never happen again\\") and primary or implicit performatives (\\"It will never happen again,\\" functioning as a promise). The initial examples of performative sentences Austin gives are these: * 'I do (sc. take this woman to be my lawful wedded wife)' ‚Äì as uttered in the course of the marriage ceremony. * 'I name this ship the \\"Queen Elizabeth\\"' * 'I give and bequeath my watch to my brother' ‚Äì as occurring in a will * 'I bet you sixpence it will rain tomorrow' (Austin 1962, 5) As Austin later notices himself, these examples belong (more or less strikingly) to what Austin calls, explicit performatives; to utter an \\"explicit\\" performative sentence is to make explicit what act one is performing. However, there are also \\"implicit\\", \\"primitive\\", or \\"inexplicit\\" performatives. When, for instance, one uses the word \\"Go!\\" in order to command someone to leave the room then this utterance is part of the performance of a command; and the sentence, according to Austin, is neither true nor false; hence the sentence is a performative; ‚Äì still, it is not an explicit performative, for it does not make explicit that the act the speaker is performing is a command. As Austin observes, the acts purported to be performed by performative utterances may be socially contested. For instance, \\"I divorce you\\", said three times by a man to his wife, may be accepted to constitute a divorce by some, but not by others. Examples (mainly of explicit performative utterances) * \\"I now pronounce you married\\" ‚Äì used in the course of a marriage ceremony * \\"I order you to go\\", \\"Gothat's an order\\" * \\"Yes\\" ‚Äì answering the question \\"Do you promise to do the dishes?\\" * \\"You are under arrest\\" ‚Äì used in putting someone under arrest * \\"I christen you\\" * \\"I accept your apology\\" * \\"I sentence you to death\\" * \\"I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you\\" (Islamic: see: Talaq-i-Bid'ah)triple Talaq * \\"I do\\" ‚Äì wedding * \\"I swear to do that\\", \\"I promise to be there\\" * \\"I apologize\\" * \\"I dedicate this...\\" (...book to my wife; ...next song to the striking Stella Doro workers, etc.) * \\"This meeting is now adjourned\\", \\"The court is now in session\\" * \\"This church is hereby de-sanctified\\" * \\"War is declared\\" * \\"I resign\\" ‚Äì employment, or chess * \\"You're [hereby] fired.\\" True/false value and John Searle John R. Searle argued in his 1989 article How Performatives Work that performatives are true/false just like constatives. Searle further claimed that performatives are what he calls declarations; this is a technical notion of Searle's account: according to his conception, an utterance is a declaration, if \\"the successful performance of the speech act is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true.\\" Searle believes that this double direction of fit contrasts the simple word-to-world fit of assertives. The receiving side Kent Bach and Robert Harnish claimed that performatives are successful only if recipients infer the intention behind the literal meaning, and that therefore the success of the performative act is determined by the receiving side. Performativeness as non-dichotomous variable Eve Sedgwick argued that there are performative aspects to nearly all words, sentences, and phrases. Additionally, according to Sedgwick, performative utterances can be 'transformative' performatives, which create an instant change of personal or environmental status, or 'promisory' performatives, which describe the world as it might be in the future. These categories are not exclusive, so an utterance may well have both qualities. As Sedgwick observes, performative utterances can be revoked, either by the person who uttered them (\\"I take back my promise\\"), or by some other party not immediately involved, like the state (for example, gay marriage vows pre-legalisation). Words on a list can be either descriptive or performative. 'Butter' on a shopping list implies that \\"I will buy butter\\" (a promise to yourself). But 'Butter' printed on your till receipt means \\"you have purchased butter\\" (simply a description). Performative writing The above ideas have influenced performative writing; they are used as a justification for an attempt to create a new form of critical writing about performance (often about performance art). Such a writing form is claimed to be, in itself, a form of performance. It is said to more accurately reflect the fleeting and ephemeral nature of a performance, and the various tricks of memory and referentiality that happen in the mind of the viewer during and after the performance.

The country is divided into 85 federal subjects, of which nine are krais. Oblasts, another type of federal subject, are legally identical to krais and the difference between a political entity with the name \\"krai\\" or \\"oblast\\" is purely traditional, similar to the commonwealths in the United States; both are constituent entities equivalent in legal status in Russia with representation in the Federation Council. During the Soviet era, the autonomous oblasts could be subordinated to republics or krais, but not to oblasts. Outside of political terminology, both words have very similar general meaning (\\"region\\" or \\"area\\" in English) and can often be used interchangeably. Overview Each krai features a state government holding authority over a defined geographic territory, with a state legislature, the Legislative Assembly, that is democratically elected. The Governor is the highest executive position of the state government in a Krai, and is elected by people. Krais can be divided into raions (districts), cities/towns of krai significance, and okrugs. Krais previously featured autonomous okrugs until the formation of Zabaykalsky Krai on March 1, 2008, when the last remaining autonomous okrug of a krai was abolished. The term krai or kray is derived from the Russian word for an edge and can be translated into English as \\"frontier\\" or \\"territory\\". The largest krai by geographic size is Krasnoyarsk Krai at and the smallest is Stavropol Krai at . The most populous krai is Krasnodar Krai at 5,404,300 (2010 Census) and the least populous is Kamchatka Krai at 322,079 (2010). Historically, krais were massive first-level administrative divisions in the Russian Empire, divided into large guberniyas (governorates). Following the numerous administration reforms during the Soviet era, the guberniyas were abolished and krais were reshaped into smaller, more numerous divisions. Eventually, krais and oblasts became almost totally equal as the top-level administrative division of the Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs), the constituent political entities of the Soviet Union, with the only difference being autonomous oblasts could be subordinated to krais but not to oblasts. The krais were unique to the Russian SFSR and held very little autonomy or power, but when the Soviet Union dissolved into sovereign states along the lines of the SSRs, they became first-level administrative divisions of the Russian Federation and received much greater devolved power.

Rat Terrier: a Comprehensive Owner's Guide. Kennel Club Books, 2004. They share much ancestry with the small hunting dogs known as feists. Common throughout family farms in the 1920s and 1930s, they are now recognized by the United and American Kennel Clubs and are considered a rare breed.Sipe, Roger (editor). Popular Dog Series Vol 43. 2006 Today's Rat Terrier is an intelligent and active small dog that is kept both for pest control and as a family pet. Info Rat Terrier Appearance The Rat Terrier ranges from about 10 to 25 pounds and stands 10 to 18 inches at the shoulder. The miniature size (13 inches and under as defined by the UKC) is becoming increasingly popular as a house pet and companion dog, but the miniature is still a hunting dog. The standard says \\"small to medium\\" and the miniature is small enough to go in and under those places where vermin like to hide. A larger strain, often in excess of 25 pounds, has been developed. Called the Decker or Decker Giant, it was named after breeder Milton Decker who created a larger hunting companion and are recognized by the National Rat Terrier Association (NRTA, see \\"Breed recognition\\" below). UKC and AKC do not recognize the Decker strain as another breed, they are merely considered a standard variety. The NRTA recognizes a Toy variety weighing 10 pounds or less. The NRTA continues to classify the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier as the Type B Rat Terrier. In the 1970s, a hairless mutation appeared in a single Rat Terrier and was propagated into a strain of the Rat Terrier. After a period of development this line resulted in the American Hairless Terrier, recognized as a separate breed by several registries. The Rat Terrier comes in a variety of coat colors. The classic coloring is black tan point with piebald spotting (known as black tricolor), but chocolate, tan (varying in shade from pale gold to dark mahogany), blue, isabella (pearl), lemon and apricot are all fairly common. They may be tricolor or bicolor, always with some amount of white present. Sable may overlay any of these colors. Creeping tan (often \\"Calico\\"), is also acceptable. Ticking is usually visible in the white parts of the coat, or in the underlying skin. Brindle, currently disallowed by the main breed standards, is considered by some to be a traditional Rat Terrier pattern, and there is a growing movement to have this pattern accepted into the breed. However, merle is widely considered to be the result of recent outcrosses and, because of associated health problems, is rejected by most Rat Terrier breeders. Rat Terriers usually have naturally erect ears and an alert expression. Ear carriage is erect, but can also be tipped, or button, all of which contribute to an intelligent, alert expression. The tail has been traditionally docked to about 2‚Äì3 inches, but the bobtail gene is very common in Rat Terriers and can result in a variety of tail lengths. Today, some breeders prefer a natural, undocked tail, which is accepted in the breed standards. Rat Terriers tend to be both intelligent and stubborn, knowing how to get what they want when they want it. They are also considered good family pets because of their energy and compatibility with kids. They are playful and require much exercise. Temperament Rat Terriers enjoy outdoor activities The social sensitivity of Rat Terriers makes them very trainable and easier to live with for the average pet owner, but it also means that extensive socialization from an early age is critical. Proper socialization of a Rat Terrier puppy includes exposing the animal to a wide variety of people and places, particularly during the first three months of life. Like most active and intelligent breeds, Rat Terriers tend to be happier when they receive a great deal of mental stimulation and exercise. Rat terriers are usually loyal to their owners and are very respectful, if they receive the proper amount of training at a young age. Health 16-year-old Rat Terrier Due to regular outcrossings throughout the Rat Terrier's history, overall it is a very hardy breed. However, with its growth in popularity in recent years some issues are becoming more common. The Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) recommends that Rat Terriers be tested for patellar luxation, cardiac abnormalities, pancreatic issues, hip dysplasia, and Legg‚ÄìCalv√©‚ÄìPerthes syndrome. The average lifespan of a well-bred Rat Terrier is 16‚Äì19 years. History The earliest known record of a rat-catching dog is that of \\"Hatch\\", whose remains were recovered from the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII, sunk in 1545 and re- raised in 1982. Hatch is thought to have been a mongrel, and was brought on board to control the rat population. The breed name comes from the occupation of its earliest ancestors brought to the US by working-class British migrants as the dogs were used in rat-baiting. However they were, for the most part, bred for speed. Their speed is used for controlling vermin and hunting small game such as squirrels and hares. After the 1890s, as the breed type became popular in the United States, they were bred with Beagles, Italian Greyhounds, and Manchester Terriers. Many of the foundation Rat Terriers were indistinguishable from small mixed-breed hunting dogs known as \\"feists\\". The smaller varieties diverged from the Rat Terrier line very early on, with UKC registration for the Toy Fox Terrier beginning in 1936. Rat Terriers were cherished as loyal hunting companions and efficient killers of vermin on 20th- century American farms: as a result, they were one of the most popular dog types from the 1920s to the 1940s. However the widespread use of chemical pesticides and the growth of commercial farming led to a sharp decline in the breed from the 1950s onwards. Breed loyalists maintained the bloodline, leading to the modern Rat Terrier. The genetic diversity of the Rat Terrier has contributed to the overall health, keen intelligence, and soundness of the breed. Most modern breeds were developed from a few founding dogs and then propagated from a closed gene pool. In contrast, the Rat Terrier has benefited from a long history of refinement with regular outcrosses to bring in useful qualities and genetic variability. In the current times, the Rat Terrier is becoming popular not only as a family pet but as a working dog in several fields. Their affectionate and calm temperament along with small size has made them popular as service dogs in hospice, treatment for depression, in Assisted Living, and other human-care jobs. Police departments have started using them as contraband search dogs as their intelligence level shortens training to as little as three weeks which is much shorter than for traditional police service breeds. Also, their small size allows search of cars, homes, and prison cells without causing the major damage a large German Shepherd or other traditional police service breed would do during a car search and lessening the chances of major financial settlements if there is nothing found during a search. In conjunction with the American rat terrier, it was reported that one of the sports of owning them was making competitive wagers about whose dog could kill the most mice or rats within a given time. One terrier was released into a barn, and in 7 hours it killed 2501 rats. Breed recognition Rat Terrier organizations exhibit the typical disputes over the course of action to be taken for the promotion and preservation of the breed. As usual among working breeds, points of departure are which dog type best represents the breed and whether the dog's working qualities will be sacrificed to selection for conformation show competition. Five-week-old Rat Terrier The Rat Terrier Club of America is the official breed parent club for the American Kennel Club. Rat Terriers were accepted into the AKC's terrier group June 2012. Rat terriers have been competing in the United Kennel Club events for over 15 years. UKC is a family-friendly group that promotes many different venues for dogs to compete. The National Rat Terrier Association is the largest independent registry and has maintained lineage records for decades. Feeling the working terrier nature of the breed will suffer, it is the most prominent of those clubs and associations opposed to Kennel Club closed-registry breeding rules. The Decker Hunting Terrier Registry was created specifically for the Decker Giant. This registry's mission is to keep all the qualities that set the Decker aside from the standard Rat Terrier, while retaining and improving upon the hunting ability. The UKC officially recognized the breed on January 1, 1999. The AKC recognized the Rat Terrier as a breed on July 1, 2010, however, it allowed them to compete in companion events beginning January 1, 2006 in sanctioned AKC Companion events (Obedience, Agility, Rally). The first Rat Terrier to earn a title under AKC Sanctioning was in Agility on January 14, 2006 in Van Nuys, California by Harpur's Giddy Upp \\"Gigi\\" and D. Davidson Harpur.AKC Gazette March 2006 page 16 AKC accepted the Rat Terrier into the Terrier Group in June 2012. The first AKC Champion Rat Terrier was \\"Annie\\" GCH GRCH King Pen RnB's Queen Ann bred, owned by Sherry & Dud Lee Hendrix of Modesto, California.

It can be either a non-standard dialect or standardized variety of the language. It can sometimes differ noticeably from the various spoken lects, but difference between literary and non-literary forms is greater in some languages than in others. Where there is a strong divergence between a written form and the spoken vernacular, the language is said to exhibit diglossia. The understanding of the term differs from one linguistic tradition to another, and is dependent on the terminological conventions adopted. Notably, in Eastern European and Slavic linguistics, the term \\"literary language\\" has also been used as a synonym of \\"standard language\\". A related concept is liturgical writing, which is the language or form of language used in the liturgy of some religions. Literary English For much of its history, there has been a distinction in the English language between an elevated literary language and a colloquial idiom.Matti Rissanen, History of Englishes: New Methods and Interpretations in Historical Linguistics, Walter de Gruyter, 1992, p9. After the Norman conquest of England, for instance, Latin and French displaced English as the official and literary languages,Elaine M. Treharne, Old and Middle English C.890-c.1400: An Anthology, Blackwell Publishing, 2004, pxxi. and standardized literary English did not emerge until the end of the Middle Ages.Pat Rogers, The Oxford Illustrated History of English Literature, Oxford University Press, 2001, p3. At this time and into the Renaissance, the practice of aureation (the introduction of terms from classical languages, often through poetry) was an important part of the reclamation of status for the English language, and many historically aureate terms are now part of general common usage. Modern English no longer has quite the same distinction between literary and colloquial registers. English has been used as a literary language in countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, for instance in India up to the present day,R.R.Mehrotra in Ofelia Garc√≠a, Ricardo Otheguy, English Across Cultures, Cultures Across English: A Reader in Cross- cultural Communication, Walter de Gruyter, 1989, p422. Malaysia in the early 20th centuryDavid Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p104. and Nigeria, where English remains the official language. Written in Early Modern English, the King James Bible and works by William Shakespeare from the 17th century are defined as prototype mediums of literary English and are taught in advanced English classes.The art of biblical translation, part one: On the eloquence of the King James Version by Robert Alter, ABC, 5 February 2019 Furthermore, many literary words that are used today are found in abundance in the works of Shakespeare and as well as in King James Bible, hence the literary importance of early modern English in contemporary English literature and English studies.Keller, Stefan Daniel. The Development of Shakespeare's Rhetoric: A Study of Nine Plays. Volume 136 of Schweizer anglistische Arbeiten. Narr Francke Attempto, 2009. . p54 Other languages Arabic Modern Standard Arabic is the contemporary literary and standard register of Classical Arabic used in writing across all Arabic-speaking countries and any governing body with Arabic as an official language. Many western scholars distinguish two varieties: the Classical Arabic of the Qur'an and early Islamic (7th to 9th centuries) literature; and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the standard language in use today. The modern standard language is closely based on the Classical language, and most Arabs consider the two varieties to be two registers of the same language. Literary Arabic or classical Arabic is the official language of all Arab countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages . The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia‚Äîthe use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts. Educated Arabic speakers are usually able to communicate in MSA in formal situations. This diglossic situation facilitates code-switching in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. In instances in which highly educated Arabic-speakers of different nationalities engage in conversation but find their dialects mutually unintelligible (e.g. a Moroccan speaking with a Kuwaiti), they are able to code switch into MSA for the sake of communication. Aramaic The Aramaic language has been diglossic for much of its history, with many different literary standards serving as the \\"high\\" liturgical languages, including Syriac language, Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic language and Mandaic language, while the vernacular Neo-Aramaic languages serve as the vernacular language spoken by the common people like Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, H√©rtevin language, Koy Sanjaq Syriac language, Senaya language), Western Neo-Aramaic, Northeastern Neo-Aramaic, Central Neo-Aramaic (Mlahs√¥ language, Turoyo language), Neo-Mandaic, Hulaul√° language, Lishana Deni, Lishanid Noshan, Lish√°n Did√°n, Betanure Jewish Neo- Aramaic, and Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic. Armenian The Armenian language was a diglossic language for much of its history, with Classical Armenian serving as the \\"high\\" literary standard and liturgical language, and the Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian dialects serving as the vernacular language of the Armenian people. Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian were eventually standardized into their own literary forms. Bengali Standard Bengali has two forms: *Ch√¥lit√¥bhasha, the vernacular standard based on the elite speech of Kolkata *Shadhubhasha, the literary standard, which employs more Sanskritized vocabulary and longer prefixes and suffixes. Grammatically, the two forms are identical, and differing forms, such as verb conjugations, are easily converted from one form to another. However, the vocabulary is quite different from one form to the other and must be learned separately. Among the works of Rabindranath Tagore are examples of both shadhubhasha (especially among his earlier works) and ch√¥lit√¥bhasha (especially among his later works). The national anthem of India was originally written in the shadhubhasha form of Bengali. Chinese Literary Chinese, W√©ny√°nw√©n (ÊñáË®ÄÊñá), \\"Literary Writing\\", is the form of written Chinese used from the end of the Han dynasty to the early 20th century when it was replaced by written vernacular Chinese, or Baihua (ÁôΩË©±) spoken according to Standard Mandarin pronunciation. Literary Chinese continually diverged from Classical Chinese as the dialects of China became more disparate and as the Classical written language became less representative of the spoken language. At the same time, Literary Chinese was based largely upon the Classical language, and writers frequently borrowed Classical language into their literary writings. Literary Chinese therefore shows a great deal of similarity to Classical Chinese, even though the similarity decreased over the centuries. Starting from early 20th century, written vernacular Chinese have become a standard for Chinese writing which is mostly aligned with a standardized form of Mandarin Chinese, which however mean there are divergence between written vernacular Chinese against other Chinese variants like Cantonese, Shanghainese, Hokkien and Sichuanese. Some of these variants have their own literary form but none of them are being used in formal register. Finnish The Finnish language has a literary variant, literary Finnish, and a spoken variant, spoken Finnish. Both are considered a form of non-dialectal standard language, and are used throughout the country. Literary Finnish is a consciously created fusion of dialects for use as a literary language, which is rarely spoken at all, being confined to writing and official speeches. Georgian The Georgian language has a literary liturgical form, the Old Georgian language, while the vernacular spoken varieties are the Georgian dialects and other related Kartvelian languages like Svan language, Mingrelian language, and Laz language.  German  German differentiates between Hochdeutsch/Standarddeutsch (Standard German) and Umgangssprache (everyday/vernacular language). Amongst the differences is the regular use of the genitive case or the simple past tense Pr√§teritum in written language. In vernacular German, genitive phrases (\\"des Tages\\") are frequently replaced with a construction of \\"von\\" + dative object (\\"von dem Tag\\") - comparable to English \\"the dog's tail\\" vs. \\"the tail of the dog\\" - likewise the Pr√§teritum (\\"ich ging\\") can be substituted with the perfect (\\"ich bin gegangen\\") to a certain degree. Nevertheless, the use of neither the Pr√§teritum nor especially the genitive case is totally unusual in daily language, though it is considered rare, and might be dependent on a region's dialect and/or the grade of education of the speaker. People of higher education use the genitive more regularly in their casual speech and the use of perfect instead of Pr√§teritum is especially common in southern Germany, where the Pr√§teritum is considered somewhat declamatory. The German Konjunktiv I / II (\\"er habe\\" / \\"er h√§tte\\") is also used more regularly in written form being replaced by the conditional (\\"er w√ºrde geben\\") in spoken language, although in some southern German dialects the Konjunktiv II is used more often. Generally there is a continuum between more dialectical varieties to more standard varieties in German, while colloquial German nonetheless tends to increase analytic elements at the expense of synthetic elements. Greek From the early nineteenth century until the mid-20th century, Katharevousa, a form of Greek, was used for literary purposes. In later years, Katharevousa was used only for official and formal purposes (such as politics, letters, official documents, and newscasting) while Dhimotiki, ‚Äòdemotic‚Äô or popular Greek, was the daily language. This created a diglossic situation until in 1976 Dhimotiki was made the official language. Hebrew During the revival of the Hebrew language, spoken and literary Hebrew were revived separately, causing a dispersion between the two. The dispersion started to narrow sometime after the two movements merged, but substantial differences between the two still exist. Italian When Italy was unified, in 1861, Italian existed mainly as a literary language. Different languages were spoken throughout the Italian Peninsula, many of which were Romance languages which had developed in every region, due to the political fragmentation of Italy. Now, it is the standard language of Italy. Japanese Until the late 1940s, the prominent literary language in Japan was the Classical Japanese language (ÊñáË™û \\"Bungo\\"), which is based on the language spoken in Heian period (Late Old Japanese) and is different from the contemporary Japanese language in grammar and some vocabulary. It still has relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived World War II are still written in bungo, although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). Bungo grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect, and fixed form poetries like Haiku and Tanka are still mainly written in this form. In the Meiji period, some authors started to use the colloquial form of the language in their literature. Following the government policy after the World War II, the standard form of contemporary Japanese language is used for most literature published since the 1950s. The standard language is based on the colloquial language in Tokyo area, and its literary stylistics in polite form differs little from its formal speech. Notable characteristics of literary language in contemporary Japanese would include more frequent use of Chinese origin words, less use of expressions against prescriptive grammar such as \\"„ÇâÊäú„ÅçË®ÄËëâ\\", and use of non-polite normal form (\\"-„Å†/-„Åß„ÅÇ„Çã\\") stylistics that are rarely used in colloquial language. Javanese In the Javanese language, alphabet characters derived from the alphabets used to write Sanskrit, no longer in ordinary use, are used in literary words as a mark of respect. Kannada Kannada exhibits a strong diglossia, like Tamil, also characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style, and a modern colloquial form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum. The formal style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of Kannada literature and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio. There are also many dialects of Kannada, one major dialect being Dharwad Kannada of North Karnataka.  Latin  Classical Latin was the literary register used in writing from 75 BC to the 3rd century AD, while Vulgar Latin was the common, spoken variety used across the Roman Empire. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to Gaul, Iberia, or Dacia was not identical to the Latin of Cicero, and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.L.R. Palmer The Latin Language (repr. Univ. Oklahoma 1988, ) Some literary works with low-register language from the Classical Latin period give a glimpse into the world of early Vulgar Latin. The works of Plautus and Terence, being comedies with many characters who were slaves, preserve some early basilectal Latin features, as does the recorded speech of the freedmen in the Cena Trimalchionis by Petronius Arbiter. At the Third Council of Tours in 813, priests were ordered to preach in the vernacular language‚Äîeither in the rustica lingua romanica (Vulgar Latin), or in the Germanic vernaculars‚Äîsince the common people could no longer understand formal Latin. Malay The Malay language exists in a classical variety, two modern standard variety and several vernacular dialects. Maltese Maltese has a variety of dialects (including the ≈ªejtun dialect, Qormi dialect and Gozitan amongst others) that co-exist alongside Standard Maltese. Literary Maltese, unlike Standard Maltese, features a preponderance of Semitic vocabulary and grammatical patterns; however, this traditional separation between Semitic and Romance influences in Maltese literature (especially Maltese poetry and Catholic liturgy on the island) is changing. Manchu Standard Manchu was based on the language spoken by the Jianzhou Jurchens during Nurhaci's time, while other unwritten Manchu dialects such as that of Aigun and Sanjiazi were also spoken in addition to the related Xibe language. Mongolian The Classical Mongolian language was the high register used for religious and official purposes, while the various Mongolian dialects served as the low register, like Khalkha Mongolian, Chakhar Mongolian, Khorchin Mongolian, Kharchin Mongolian, Baarin Mongolian, Ordos Mongolian and the Buryat language. The Tibetan Buddhist canon was translated into Classical Mongolian. The Oirat Mongols who spoke the Oirat Mongol language and dialects like Kalmyk language or Torgut Oirat used a separate standard written with the Clear script. The Mongolian language, based on Khalkha Mongolian, now serves as the high register in Mongolia itself while in Inner Mongolia a standard Mongolian based on Chakhar Mongolian serves as the high register for all Mongols in China. The Buryat language, which is seen by some as part of the Mongolian language, has been turned into a standard literary form itself in Russia. N'Ko N'Ko is a literary language devised by Solomana Kante in 1949 as a writing system for the Mande languages of West Africa. It blends the principal elements of the partially mutually intelligible Manding languages. The movement promoting N'Ko literacy was instrumental in shaping the Maninka cultural identity in Guinea, and has also strengthened the Mande identity in other parts of West Africa.Oyler, Dianne White (1994) Mande identity through literacy, the N'ko writing system as an agent of cultural nationalism. Toronto : African Studies Association. N'Ko publications include a translation of the Qur'an, a variety of textbooks on subjects such as physics and geography, poetic and philosophical works, descriptions of traditional medicine, a dictionary, and several local newspapers. Persian Persian or New Persian has been used continually as the literary language of major areas in Western Asia, the Caucasus, Central Asia and South Asia. The language written today remains essentially the same as that used by Ferdowsi despite variant colloquial dialects and forms. For many centuries, people belonging to the educated classes from the Bosphorus to the Bay of Bengal would be expected to know some Persian. It was once the language of culture (especially of poetry), from the Balkans to the Deccan, functioning as a lingua franca. Until the late 18th century, Persian was the dominant literary language of Georgia's elite. Persian was the second major vehicle after Arabic in transmitting Islamic culture and has a particularly prominent place in Sufism. Serbian Slavonic-Serbian (slavenosrpski) was the literary language of Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy used from the mid-18th century to 1825. It was a linguistic blend of Church Slavonic of the Russian recension, vernacular Serbian (≈†tokavian dialect), and Russian. At the beginning of the 19th century, it was severely attacked by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá and his followers, whose reformatory efforts formed modern literary Serbian based on the popular language, known as Serbo- Croatian. Tagalog Tagalog was the basis of the Filipino language; both share the same vocabulary and grammatical system and are mutually intelligible. However, there is a significant political and social history that underlies the reasons for differentiating between Tagalog and Filipino. Modern Tagalog is derived from Archaic Tagalog, which was likely spoken during the Classical period, it was the language of the Mai State, Tondo Dynasty (according to the Laguna Copperplate Inscription) and southern Luzon. It was written using Baybayin, a syllabary which is a member of the Brahmic family, before the Spanish Romanised the alphabet beginning in the late 15th century. Tagalog was also the spoken language of the 1896 Philippine Revolution. The 1987 Constitution maintains that Filipino is the country‚Äôs national language and one of two official languages, alongside English. Today, Filipino is considered the proper term for the language of the Philippines, especially by Filipino-speakers who are not of Tagalog origin, with many referring to the Filipino language as ‚ÄúTagalog-based\\". The language is taught in schools throughout the country and is the official language of education and business. Native Tagalog-speakers meanwhile comprise one of the largest linguistic and cultural groups of the Philippines, numbering an estimated 14 million. Tamil Tamil exhibits a strong diglossia, characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style and a modern colloquial form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum.Harold Schiffman, \\"Diglossia as a Sociolinguistic Situation\\", in Florian Coulmas (ed.), The Handbook of Sociolinguistics. London: Basil Blackwell, Ltd., 1997 at pp. 205 et seq. The modern literary style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of Tamil literature and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio. Tibetan Classical Tibetan was the high register used universally by all Tibetans while the various mutually unintelligible Tibetic languages serve as the low register vernacular, like Central Tibetan language in √ú-Tsang (Tibet proper), Khams Tibetan in Kham, Amdo Tibetan in Amdo, Ladakhi language in Ladakh and Dzongkha in Bhutan. Classical Tibetan was used for official and religious purposes, such as in Tibetan Buddhist religious texts like the Tibetan Buddhist canon and taught and learned in monasteries and schools in Tibetan Buddhist regions. Now, Standard Tibetan, based on the Lhasa dialect, serves as the high register in China. In Bhutan, the Tibetan Dzongkha language has been standardised and replaced Classical Tibetan for official purposes and education, in Ladakh, the standard official language learned are now the unrelated languages Urdu and English, and in Baltistan, the Tibetan Balti language serves as the low register while the unrelated Urdu is the official language. Uzbek and Uyghur The Turkic Chagatai language served as the high register literary standard for Central Asian Turkic peoples, while the vernacular low register languages were the Uzbek language and Eastern Turki (Modern Uyghur). The Soviet Union abolished Chagatai as the literary standard and had the Uzbek language standardized as a literary language for, and the Taranchi dialect of Ili was chosen as the literary standard for Modern Uyghur, while other dialects like the Kashgar and Turpan dialects continue to be spoken. Yor√πb√° Samuel Crowther's Yor√πb√° grammar led to Standard Yoruba becoming a literary language. Standard Yoruba is the literary form of the Yoruba language of West Africa, the standard variety learnt at school and that spoken by newsreaders on the radio. Standard Yoruba has its origin in the 1850s, when Samuel A. Crowther, native Yoruba and the first African Anglican Bishop in Nigeria, published a Yoruba grammar and started his translation of the Bible. Though for a large part based on the ·ªåy·ªç and Ibadan dialects, Standard Yoruba incorporates several features from other dialects.Cf. for example the following remark by Adetugb·ªç (1967, as cited in Fagborun 1994:25): \\"While the orthography agreed upon by the missionaries represented to a very large degree the phonemes of the Ab·∫πokuta dialect, the morpho-syntax reflected the ·ªåy·ªç-Ibadan dialects\\". Additionally, it has some features peculiar to itself only, for example the simplified vowel harmony system, as well as foreign structures, such as calques from English which originated in early translations of religious works. The first novel in the Yor√πb√° language was Ogboju Ode ninu Igbo Irunmale (The Forest of A Thousand Demons), written in 1938 by Chief Daniel O. Fagunwa (1903‚Äì1963). Other writers in the Yor√πb√° language include: Senator Afolabi Olabimtan (1932‚Äì1992) and Akinwunmi Isola.

The islands are named Marion Island (named after Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne) and Prince Edward Island (named after Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn). The islands in the group have been declared Special Nature Reserves under the South African Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act, No. 57 of 2003, and activities on the islands are therefore restricted to research and conservation management. Further protection was granted when the area was declared a marine protected area in 2013. The only human inhabitants of the islands are the staff of a meteorological and biological research station run by the South African National Antarctic Programme on Marion Island. History Prince Edward, after whom the islands are named The islands were discovered on 4 March 1663 by Barent Barentszoon Lam of the Dutch East India Company ship Maerseveen and were named Dina (Prince Edward) and Maerseveen (Marion),Pieter Arend Leupe: De eilanden Dina en Maerseveen in den Zuider Atlantischen Oceaan; in: Verhandelingen en berigten betrekkelijk het zeewezen, de zeevaartkunde, de hydrographie, de koloni√´n en de daarmede in verband staande wetenschappen, Jg. 1868, Deel 28, Afd. 2, [No.] 9; Amsterdam 1868 (pp. 242‚Äì253); cf. but the islands were erroneously recorded to be at 41¬∞ South, and neither were found again by subsequent Dutch sailors. In January 1772, the French frigate Le Mascarin, captained by Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, visited the islands and spent five days trying to land, thinking they had found Antarctica (then not yet proven to exist). Marion named the islands Terre de l'Esp√©rance (Marion) and Ile de la Caverne (Pr. Edward). After failing to land, Le Mascarin continued eastward, discovering the Crozet Islands and landing at New Zealand, where Marion du Fresne and some of his crew were killed and eaten by MƒÅori natives. Julien Crozet, navigator and second in command of Le Mascarin, survived the disaster, and happened to meet James Cook at Cape Town in 1776, at the onset of Cook's third voyage. Crozet shared the charts of his ill-fated expedition, and as Cook sailed from Cape Town, he passed the islands on 13 December, but was unable to attempt a landing due to bad weather. Cook named the islands after Prince Edward, the fourth son of King George III; and though he is also often credited with naming the larger island Marion, after Captain Marion, this name was adopted by sealers and whalers who later hunted the area, to distinguish the two islands. The first recorded landing on the islands was in 1799 by a group of French seal hunters of the Sally. Another landing in late 1803 by a group of seal hunters led by American captain Henry Fanning of the Catharine found signs of earlier human occupation. The islands were frequented by sealers until about 1810, when the local fur seal populations had been nearly eradicated. The first scientific expedition to the islands was led by James Clark Ross, who visited in 1840 during his exploration of the Antarctic, but was unable to land. Ross sailed along the islands on 21 April 1840. He made observations on vast numbers of penguins (\\"groups of many thousands each\\"), and other kinds of sea-birds. He also saw fur seals, which he supposed to be of the species Arctocephalus falklandicus. The islands were finally surveyed during the Challenger Expedition, led by Captain George Nares, in 1873. The sealing era lasted from 1799 to 1913. During that period visits by 103 vessel are recorded, seven of which ended in shipwreck.R.K. Headland, Historical Antarctic sealing industry, Scott Polar Research Institute (Cambridge University), 2018, p.167 Sealing relics include iron trypots, the ruins of huts and inscriptions. The occasional modern sealing vessel visited from Cape Town, South Africa, in the 1920s. The islands have been the location of other shipwrecks. In June 1849 the brig Richard Dart, with a troop of Royal Engineers under Lt. James Liddell, was wrecked on Prince Edward island; only 10 of the 63 on board survived to be rescued by elephant seal hunters from Cape Town.Wreck of the troopship Richard Dart In 1908 the Norwegian vessel Solglimt was shipwrecked on Marion Island, and survivors established a short-lived village at the north coast, before being rescued. The wreck of the Solglimt is the best-known in the islands, and is accessible to divers. On September 22, 1979, a US surveillance satellite known as Vela 6911 noted an unidentified double flash of light, known as the Vela incident, in the waters off the islands. There was and continues to be considerable controversy over whether this event was perhaps an undeclared nuclear test carried out by South Africa and Israel or some other event. The cause of the flash remains officially unknown, and some information about the event remains classified. Today, most independent researchers believe that the 1979 flash was caused by a nuclear explosion. In 2003, the South African government declared the Prince Edward Islands a Special Nature Reserve, and in 2013 declared of ocean waters around the islands a Marine Protection Area, thus creating one of the world's largest environmental protection areas. Marion Research Station In 1908 the British government assumed ownership of the islands. In late 1947 and early 1948, South Africa, with Britain's agreement, annexed the islands and installed the meteorological station on Transvaal Cove on the north-east coast of Marion Island. The research station was soon enlarged and today studies regional meteorology and the biology of the islands, in particular the birds (penguins, petrels, albatrosses, gulls) and seals. A new research base was built from 2001 to 2011 to replace older buildings on the site. The access to the station is either by boat or helicopter. A helipad and storage hangar is located behind the main base structure. In April 2017, the South African National Antarctic Programme launched a new experiment on Marion Island called Probing Radio Intensity at high-Z from Marion (PRIZM), searching for signatures of the hydrogen line in the early universe.  Geography and geology  The island group is about south-east of Port Elizabeth in mainland South Africa. At 46 degrees latitude, the distance to the equator is only slightly longer than to the South Pole. Marion Island (), the larger of the two, is long and wide with an area of and a coastline of some , most of which is high cliffs. The highest point on Marion Island is Mascarin Peak (formerly State President Swart Peak), reaching above sea level. The topography of Marion Island includes many hillocks and small lakes, and boggy lowland terrain with little vegetation. Prince Edward Island Prince Edward Island () is much smaller‚Äîonly about , long and wide‚Äîand lies some to the north-east of Marion Island. The terrain is generally rocky, with high cliffs () on its south western side. At the van Zinderen Bakker Peak north-west of the center, it reaches a height of .Peakbagger ‚Äì Van Zinderen Bakker Peak, South Africa There are a few offshore rocks along the northern coast of Prince Edward Island, like Ship Rock north of northernmost point, and Ross Rocks from the shore. Boot Rock is about off the northern coast of Marion Island. Marion Island Both islands are of volcanic origin. Marion Island is one of the peaks of a large underwater shield volcano that rises some from the sea floor to the top of Mascarin Peak. The volcano is active, with eruptions having occurred between 1980 and 2004.  Climate  Despite being located inside the south temperate zone at 46 degrees latitude, the islands have a tundra climate. They lie directly in the path of eastward-moving depressions all year round and this gives them an unusually cool and windy climate. Strong regional winds, known as the roaring forties, blow almost every day of the year, and the prevailing wind direction is north-westerly. Annual rainfall averages from up to over on Mascarin Peak. In spite of its very chilly climate it is located closer to the equator than mild northern hemisphere climates such as Paris and Seattle and only one degree farther south than fellow southern hemisphere climates such as Comodoro Rivadavia in Argentina and Alexandra in New Zealand. Many climates on lower latitudes in the opposite hemisphere have far colder winters than Prince Edward Islands due to their maritime moderation, even though temperatures in summer are way short of normal maritime climates. It rains on average about 320 days a year (about 28 days a month) and the islands are among the cloudiest places in the world; about 1300 hours a year of sunshine occurs on the sheltered eastern side of Marion Island but only around 800 hours occur away from the coast on the wet western sides of Marion and Prince Edward Islands. Summer and winter have fairly similar climates with cold winds and threat of snow or frost at any time of the year. However, the mean temperature in February (midsummer) is and in August (midwinter) it is .General Survey of Climatology, V12 (2001), ElsevierGISS Climate data averages for 1978 to 2007, source ‚Äì GHCN  Flora and fauna  SA Agulhas, with a penguin swimming in the water and kelp on the shore The islands are part of the Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra ecoregion that includes a small number of subantarctic islands. Because of the paucity of land masses in the Southern Ocean, the islands host a wide variety of species and are critical to conservation. In the cold subantarctic climate, plants are mainly limited to grasses, mosses, and kelp, while lichens are the most visible fungi. The main indigenous animals are insects along with large populations of seabirds, seals and penguins. At least twenty-nine different species of birds are thought to breed on the islands, and it is estimated the islands support upwards of 5 million breeding seabirds, and 8 million seabirds total. Five species of albatross (of which all are either threatened or endangered) are known to breed on the islands, including the wandering albatross, dark-mantled, light-mantled, Indian yellow-nosed and grey-headed albatross. The islands also host fourteen species of petrel, four species of prion, the Antarctic tern, and the brown skua, among others seabirds. Four penguin species are found, including king penguins, Eastern rockhoppers, gentoos and macaroni penguins. A wandering albatrossThree species of seal breed on the islands, including the southern elephant seal, the Antarctic fur seal, and the Subantarctic fur seal. The waters surrounding the islands are often frequented by several species of whale, especially orcas, which prey on penguins and seals. Large whales such as southern rights and southern humpbacks, and leopard seals are seen more sporadically, and it remains unclear how large or stable their current local populations are, though it is thought their numbers are significantly down compared to the time of first human contact with the islands. The area saw heavy sealing and whaling operations in the nineteenth century and continued to be subject to mass illegal whaling until the 1970s, with the Soviet Union and Japan allegedly continuing whaling operations into the 1990s. Currently, the greatest ecological threat is the longline fishing of Patagonian toothfish, which endangers a number of seabirds that dive into the water after baited hooks.  Invasive species  The wildlife is particularly vulnerable to introduced species and the historical problem has been with cats and mice. House mice arrived to Marion Island with whaling and sealing ships in the 1800s and quickly multiplied, so much so that in 1949, five domestic cats were brought to the research base to deal with them. The cats multiplied quickly, and by 1977 there were approximately 3,400 cats on the island, feeding on burrowing petrels in addition to mice, and taking an estimated 455,000 petrels a year. Some species of petrels soon disappeared from Marion Island, and a cat eradication programme was established. A few cats were intentionally infected with the highly specific feline panleukopenia virus, which reduced the cat population to about 600 by 1982. The remaining cats were killed by nocturnal shooting, and in 1991 only eight cats were trapped in a 12-month period. It is believed that no cats remain on Marion Island today, and with the cats gone, the mouse population has sharply increased to \\"plague like\\" levels. In 2003, ornithologists discovered that in the absence of other food sources, the mice were attacking albatross chicks and eating them alive as they sat helplessly on their nests. A similar problem has been observed on Gough Island, where a mouse eradication programme is currently planned to begin in 2019, with the island expected to be mouse free by 2021. A programme to eradicate invasive rats on South Georgia Island was completed in 2015, and as of 2016 the island appears to be completely rat free. The geography of Marion Island presents certain obstacles not found on either Gough or South Georgia islands, particularly its large size, high elevations and variable weather. An assessment of the island was completed in May 2015, led by noted invasive species ecologist John Parkes, with the general conclusion that an eradication programme is feasible, but will require precise planning. Both Gough Island and the Prince Edward Islands also suffer from invasive procumbent pearlwort (Sagina procumbens), which is transforming the upland ecosystem and is now considered beyond control.Cooper, J. et al., \\"Earth, fire and water: applying novel techniques to eradicate the invasive plant, procumbent pearlwort Sagina procumbenss, on Gough Island, a World heritage Site in the South Atlantic\\", Invasive Species Specialist Group, 2010, Retrieved on 12 February 2014.  Legal status  Logo of Marion Island Marion Island and Prince Edward Island were claimed for South Africa on 29 December 1947 and 4 January 1948 respectively, by a South African Navy force from HMSAS Transvaal under the command of John Fairbairn. On 1 October 1948 the annexation was made official when Governor-General Gideon Brand van Zyl signed the Prince Edward Islands Act, 1948. In terms of the Act, the islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Cape Town Magistrate's Court, and South African law as applied in the Western Cape applies on them. The islands are also deemed to be situated within the electoral district containing the Port of Cape Town; this is ward 115 of the City of Cape Town.

The marches were organized by nonviolent activists to demonstrate the desire of African-American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote, in defiance of segregationist repression; they were part of a broader voting rights movement underway in Selma and throughout the American South. By highlighting racial injustice, they contributed to passage that year of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark federal achievement of the civil rights movement. Southern state legislatures had passed and maintained a series of discriminatory requirements and practices that had disenfranchised most of the millions of African Americans across the South throughout the 20th century. The African-American group known as the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL) launched a voter registration campaign in Selma in 1963. Joined by organizers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), they began working that year in a renewed effort to register black voters. Finding resistance by white officials to be intractable, even after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended legal segregation, the DCVL invited Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the activists of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to join them. SCLC brought many prominent civil rights and civic leaders to Selma in January 1965. Local and regional protests began, with 3,000 people arrested by the end of February. According to Joseph A. Califano Jr., who served as head of domestic affairs for U.S. President Lyndon Johnson between the years 1965 and 1969, the President viewed King as an essential partner in getting the Voting Rights Act enacted. Califano, whom the President also assigned to monitor the final march to Montgomery,From Selma to Montgomery LBJ Presidential Library. Retrieved April 23, 2015. said that Johnson and King talked by telephone on January 15 to plan a strategy for drawing attention to the injustice of using literacy tests and other barriers to stop black Southerners from voting, and that King later informed the President on February 9 of his decision to use Selma to achieve this objective. On February 26, 1965, activist and deacon Jimmie Lee Jackson died after being shot several days earlier by state trooper James Bonard Fowler, during a peaceful march in nearby Marion, Alabama. To defuse and refocus the community's outrage, James Bevel, who was directing SCLC's Selma voting rights movement, called for a march of dramatic length, from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery.Randall Kryn, \\"James L. Bevel The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement,\\" In David Garrow's 1989 book We Shall Overcome, Volume II, New York: Carlson Publishing Company, 1989.Randy Kryn, \\"Movement Revision Research Summary Regarding James Bevel\\", October 2005, Middlebury College. Bevel had been working on his Alabama Project for voting rights since late 1963. The first march took place on March 7, 1965, organized locally by Bevel, Amelia Boynton, and others. State troopers and county possemen attacked the unarmed marchers with billy clubs and tear gas after they passed over the county line, and the event became known as Bloody Sunday. Law enforcement beat Boynton unconscious, and the media publicized worldwide a picture of her lying wounded on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The second march took place March 9. Troopers, police, and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge, but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass, King led the marchers back to the church. He was obeying a federal injunction while seeking protection from federal court for the march. That night, a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist James Reeb, a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma to march with the second group. Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country also gathered for the second march. The violence of \\"Bloody Sunday\\" and Reeb's murder resulted in a national outcry and some acts of civil disobedience, targeting both the Alabama and federal governments. The protesters demanded protection for the Selma marchers and a new federal voting rights law to enable African Americans to register and vote without harassment. President Lyndon Johnson, whose administration had been working on a voting rights law, held a historic, nationally televised joint session of Congress on March 15 to ask for the bill's introduction and passage. With Governor Wallace refusing to protect the marchers, President Johnson committed to do so. The third march started on March 21. Protected by 1,900 members of the Alabama National Guard under federal command, and many FBI agents and federal marshals, the marchers averaged 10 miles (16 km) a day along U.S. Route 80, known in Alabama as the \\"Jefferson Davis Highway\\". The marchers arrived in Montgomery on March 24 and at the Alabama State Capitol on March 25. With thousands having joined the campaign, 25,000 people entered the capital city that day in support of voting rights. The route is memorialized as the \\"Selma To Montgomery Voting Rights Trail\\", and is designated as a U.S. National Historic Trail. The Voting Rights Act became law on August 6, 1965. Selma movement established: 1963‚Äì1964 At the turn of the 20th century, the Alabama state legislature passed a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites by requirements for payment of a poll tax and passing a literacy test and comprehension of the constitution. Subjective application of the laws effectively closed most blacks out of politics. Selma is a major town and the seat of Dallas County, part of the Alabama Black Belt with a majority-black population. In 1961, the population of Dallas County was 57% black, but of the 15,000 blacks old enough to vote, only 130 were registered (fewer than 1%). At that time, more than 80% of Dallas County blacks lived below the poverty line, most of them working as sharecroppers, farmhands, maids, janitors, and day laborers, but there were also teachers and business owners.\\"Selma ‚Äî Breaking the Grip of Fear\\" ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans. With the literacy test administered subjectively by white registrars, even educated blacks were prevented from registering or voting.Are You \\"Qualified\\" to Vote? The Alabama \\"Literacy Test\\" ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans. Led by the Boynton family (Amelia, Sam, and son Bruce), Rev. L. L. Anderson, J. L. Chestnut, and Marie Foster, the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL) tried to register black citizens during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Their efforts were blocked by state and local officials, the White Citizens' Council, and the Ku Klux Klan. By the 1960s, county officials and the Citizens' Council used such tactics as restricted registration hours; economic pressure, including threatening people's jobs, firing them, evicting people from leased homes, and economic boycotts of black-owned businesses; and violence against blacks who tried to register. The Society of Saint Edmund, an order of Catholics committed to alleviating poverty and promoting civil rights, were the only whites in Selma who openly supported the voting rights campaign.\\"Edmundite Southern Missions\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama. SNCC staff member Don Jelinek later described this order as \\"the unsung heroes of the Selma March ... who provided the only integrated Catholic church in Selma, and perhaps in the entire Deep South\\".\\"Don Jelinek, Oral History/Interview, 2005-Selma Underground: Fathers of St. Edmund\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans website. In early 1963, SNCC organizers Bernard Lafayette and Colia Liddel Lafayette arrived in Selma to begin a voter-registration project in cooperation with the DCVL. In mid-June, Bernard was beaten and almost killed by Klansmen determined to prevent blacks from voting. When the Lafayettes returned to college in the fall, SNCC organizers Prathia Hall and Worth Long carried on the work despite arrests, beatings, and death threats. When 32 black school teachers applied at the county courthouse to register as voters, they were immediately fired by the all-white school board. After the Birmingham church bombing on September 15, 1963, which killed four black girls, black students in Selma began sit-ins at local lunch counters to protest segregation; they were physically attacked and arrested. More than 300 were arrested in two weeks of protests, including SNCC Chairman John Lewis.\\"Freedom Day in Selma\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans. On October 7, 1963, one of two days during the month when residents were allowed to go to the courthouse to apply to register to vote, SNCC's James Forman and the DCVL mobilized more than 300 blacks from Dallas County to line up at the voter registration office in what was called a \\"Freedom Day\\". Supporting them were national figures: author James Baldwin and his brother David, and comedian Dick Gregory and his wife Lillian (she was later arrested for picketing with SNCC activists and local supporters). SNCC members who tried to bring water to African Americans waiting on line were arrested, as were those who held signs saying \\"Register to Vote\\". After waiting all day in the hot sun, only a handful of the hundreds in the line were allowed to fill out the voter application, and most of those applications were denied by white county officials. United States Justice Department lawyers and FBI agents were present and observing the scene, but took no action against local officials. On July 2, 1964, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law, prohibiting segregation of public facilities. Some Jim Crow laws and customs remained in effect in Selma and other places for some time. When activists resumed efforts to integrate Selma's eating and entertainment venues, blacks who tried to attend the movie theater and eat at the hamburger stand were beaten and arrested. On July 6, 1964, one of the two registration days that month, John Lewis led 50 black citizens to the courthouse, but County Sheriff Jim Clark arrested them all instead of allowing them to apply to vote. On July 9, 1964, Judge James Hare issued an injunction forbidding any gathering of three or more people under the sponsorship of civil rights organizations or leaders. This injunction made it illegal for more than two people at a time to talk about civil rights or voter registration in Selma, suppressing public civil rights activity there for the next six months.\\"The Selma Injunction\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans.  1965 campaign launched  Background With civil rights activity blocked by Judge Hare's injunction, Frederick Douglas Reese requested the assistance of King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Reese was president of the DCVL, but the group declined to invite the SCLC; the invitation instead came from a group of local activists who would become known as the Courageous Eight ‚Äì Ulysses S. Blackmon, Sr., Amelia Boynton, Ernest Doyle, Marie Foster, James Gildersleeve, J.D. Hunter, Sr., Henry Shannon, Sr., and Reese. Three of SCLC's main organizers ‚Äì James Bevel, Diane Nash, and James Orange ‚Äì had already been working on Bevel's Alabama Voting Rights Project since late 1963. King and the executive board of SCLC had not joined it.Randall Kryn, \\"James L. Bevel The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement\\", in David Garrow, We Shall Overcome, Volume II, New York: Carlson Publishing Company, 1989. When SCLC officially accepted the invitation from the \\"Courageous Eight\\", Bevel, Nash, Orange, and others in SCLC began working in Selma in December 1964. They also worked in the surrounding counties, along with the SNCC staff who had been active there since early 1963. Since the rejection of voting status for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates by the regular delegates at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, major tensions between SCLC and SNCC had been brewing. SCLC ultimately remained neutral in the MFDP dispute in order to maintain its ties with the national Democratic coalition. Many SNCC members believed they were in an adversarial position with an American establishment which they thought had scorned grassroots democracy. SNCC's focus was on bottom-up organizing, establishing deep-rooted local power bases through community organizing. They had become distrustful of SCLC's spectacular mobilizations which were designed to appeal to the national media and Washington DC, but which, most of SNCC believed, did not result in major improvements for the lives of African Americans on the ground. But, SNCC chairman John Lewis (also an SCLC board member), believed mass mobilizations to be invaluable, and he urged the group to participate.\\"1965 ‚Äì SCLC and SNCC\\". Civil Rights Movement Veterans website SNCC called in Fay Bellamy and Silas Norman to be full-time organizers in Selma.\\"1965 ‚Äì Breaking the Selma Injunction\\", Civil Right Movement Veterans Timeline. Selma had both moderate and hardline segregationists in its white power structure. The newly elected Mayor Joseph Smitherman was a moderate who hoped to attract Northern business investment, and he was very conscious of the city's image. Smitherman appointed veteran lawman Wilson Baker to head the city's 30-man police force. Baker believed that the most effective method of undermining civil rights protests was to de-escalate them and deny them publicity, as Police Chief Laurie Pritchett had done against the Albany Movement in Georgia. He earned what was described as a grudging respect from activists. The hardline of segregation was represented by Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark, who used violence and repression to maintain Jim Crow. He commanded a posse of 200 deputies, some of whom were members of Ku Klux Klan chapters or the National States' Rights Party. Possemen were armed with electric cattle-prods. Some were mounted on horseback and carried long leather whips they used to lash people on foot. Clark and Chief Baker were known to spar over jurisdiction. Baker's police patrolled the city except for the block of the county courthouse, which Clark and his deputies controlled. Outside the city limits, Clark and his volunteer posse were in complete control in the county.\\"\\"1965 ‚Äì Selma on the Eve\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline. Events of January The Selma Voting Rights Campaign officially started on January 2, 1965, when King addressed a mass meeting in Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church in defiance of the anti-meeting injunction. The date had been chosen because Sheriff Clark was out of town, and Chief Baker had stated he would not enforce the injunction. Over the following weeks, SCLC and SNCC activists expanded voter registration drives and protests in Selma and the adjacent Black Belt counties. Preparations for mass registration commenced in early January, and with King out of town fundraising, were largely under the leadership of Diane Nash. On January 15, King called President Johnson and the two agreed to begin a major push for voting rights legislation which would assist in advancing the passage of more anti-poverty legislation.Johnson Conversation with Martin Luther King on January 15, 1965 (WH6501.04), Miller Center of Public Affairs. Accessed September 13, 2017 After King returned to Selma, the first big \\"Freedom Day\\" of the new campaign occurred on January 18. According to their respective strategies, Chief Baker's police were cordial toward demonstrators, but Sheriff Clark refused to let black registrants enter the county courthouse. Clark made no arrests or assaults at this time. However, in an incident that drew national attention, Dr. King was knocked down and kicked by a leader of the National States Rights Party, who was quickly arrested by Chief Baker.\\"1965 ‚Äì Marching to the Courthouse\\". Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline Baker also arrested the head of the American Nazi Party, George Lincoln Rockwell, who said he'd come to Selma to \\"run King out of town\\".\\"United Press International King Struck, Kicked During Racial Drive\\", Chicago Tribune, January 19, 1965. Over the next week, blacks persisted in their attempts to register. Sheriff Clark responded by arresting organizers, including Amelia Boynton and Hosea Williams. Eventually, 225 registrants were arrested as well at the county courthouse. Their cases were handled by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. On January 20, President Johnson gave his inaugural address but did not mention voting rights. Up to this point, the overwhelming majority of registrants and marchers were sharecroppers, blue-collar workers, and students. On January 22, Frederick Reese, a black schoolteacher who was also DCVL President, finally convinced his colleagues to join the campaign and register en masse. When they refused Sheriff Clark's orders to disperse at the courthouse, an ugly scene commenced. Clark's posse beat the teachers away from the door, but they rushed back only to be beaten again. The teachers retreated after three attempts, and marched to a mass meeting where they were celebrated as heroes by the black community.\\"1965 ‚Äì Teachers March\\". Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline. On January 25, U.S. District Judge Daniel Thomas issued rules requiring that at least 100 people must be permitted to wait at the courthouse without being arrested. After Dr. King led marchers to the courthouse that morning, Jim Clark began to arrest all registrants in excess of 100, and corral the rest. Annie Lee Cooper, a fifty-three-year-old practical nurse who had been part of the Selma movement since 1963, struck Clark after he twisted her arm, and she knocked him to his knees. Four deputies seized Cooper, and photographers captured images of Clark beating her repeatedly with his club. The crowd was inflamed and some wanted to intervene against Clark, but King ordered them back as Cooper was taken away. Although Cooper had violated nonviolent discipline, the movement rallied around her. James Bevel, speaking at a mass meeting, deplored her actions because \\"then [the press] don't talk about the registration.\\"\\"1965 ‚Äì Annie Cooper and Sheriff Clark\\". Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline. But when asked about the incident by Jet magazine, Bevel said, \\"Not everybody who registers is nonviolent; not everybody who registers is supposed to be nonviolent.\\" The incident between Clark and Cooper was a media sensation, putting the campaign on the front page of The New York Times.David Garrow, Protest at Selma (Yale University Press, 1978), p. 45. When asked if she would do it again, Cooper told Jet, \\"I try to be nonviolent, but I just can't say I wouldn't do the same thing all over again if they treat me brutish like they did this time.\\" Events of February Dr. King decided to make a conscious effort to get arrested, for the benefit of publicity. On February 1, King and Ralph Abernathy refused to cooperate with Chief Baker's traffic directions on the way to the courthouse, calculating that Baker would arrest them, putting them in the Selma city jail run by Baker's police, rather than the county jail run by Clark's deputies. Once processed, King and Abernathy refused to post bond. On the same day, SCLC and SNCC organizers took the campaign outside of Dallas County for the first time; in nearby Perry County 700 students and adults, including James Orange, were arrested.\\"1965 ‚Äì Letter from a Selma Jail\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline. On the same day, students from Tuskegee Institute, working in cooperation with SNCC, were arrested for acts of civil disobedience in solidarity with the Selma campaign.\\"The Alabama Struggle\\". SNCC pamphlet In New York and Chicago, Friends of SNCC chapters staged sit-ins at federal buildings in support of Selma blacks, and CORE chapters in the North and West also mounted protests. Solidarity pickets began circling in front of the White House late into the night. After the assault on Dr. King by the white supremacist in January, black nationalist leader Malcolm X had sent an open telegram to George Lincoln Rockwell, stating: \\"if your present racist agitation against our people there in Alabama causes physical harm ... you and your KKK friends will be met with maximum physical retaliation from those of us who ... believe in asserting our right to self-defense by any means necessary.\\"Christopher Strain, Pure Fire: Self-Defense as Activism in the Civil Rights Era (University of Georgia Press, 2005), pp. 92‚Äì93. Fay Bellamy and Silas Norman attended a talk by Malcolm X to 3,000 students at the Tuskegee Institute, and invited him to address a mass meeting at Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church to kick off the protests on the morning of February 4.Taylor Branch, Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963‚Äì1965 (Simon & Schuster, 1999), pp. 578‚Äì579. When Malcolm X arrived, SCLC staff initially wanted to block his talk, but he assured them that he did not intend to undermine their work. During his address, Malcolm X warned the protesters about \\"house negroes\\" who, he said, were a hindrance to black liberation. Dr. King later said that he thought this was an attack on him.\\"Clayborne Carson The Unfinished Dialogue of Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X\\", Souls 7 (1): 12‚Äì19, 2005. But Malcolm told Coretta Scott King that he thought to aid the campaign by warning white people what \\"the alternative\\" would be if Dr. King failed in Alabama. Bellamy recalled that Malcolm told her he would begin recruiting in Alabama for his Organization of Afro-American Unity later that month (Malcolm was assassinated two weeks later).Alvin Adams, \\"Malcolm 'seemed sincere, Jet, March 11, 1965. That February 4, President Lyndon Johnson made his first public statement in support of the Selma campaign. At midday, Judge Thomas, at the Justice Department's urging, issued an injunction that suspended Alabama's current literacy test, ordered Selma to take at least 100 applications per registration day, and guaranteed that all applications received by June 1 would be processed before July. In response to Thomas' favorable ruling, and in alarm at Malcolm X's visit, Andrew Young, who was not in charge of the Selma movement, said he would suspend demonstrations. James Bevel, however, continued to ask people to line up at the voter's registration office as they had been doing, and Dr. King called Young from jail, telling him the demonstrations would continue. They did so the next day, and more than 500 protesters were arrested.Taylor Branch, Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963‚Äì1965 (Simon & Schuster, 1999), pp. 580‚Äì581.\\"1965 ‚Äì Bound in Jail\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline. On February 5, King bailed himself and Abernathy out of jail. On February 6, the White House announced that it would urge Congress to enact a voting rights bill during the current session and that the Vice-President and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach would meet with King in the following week.May, Gary (2013). Bending Towards Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy, Basic Books. p. 69. On February 9, King met with Attorney General Katzenbach, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and White House aides before having a brief, seven-minute session with President Johnson. Following the Oval Office visit, King reported that Johnson planned to deliver his message \\"very soon\\".Germany, Kent. \\"Selma, Martin Luther King Jr., and the Lyndon Johnson Tapes \\". Miller Center of Public Affairs. Retrieved April 19, 2015. Throughout that February, King, SCLC staff, and members of Congress met for strategy sessions at the Selma, Alabama home of Richie Jean Jackson. In addition to actions in Selma, marches and other protests in support of voting rights were held in neighboring Perry, Wilcox, Marengo, Greene, and Hale counties. Attempts were made to organize in Lowndes County, but fear of the Klan there was so intense from previous violence and murders that blacks would not support a nonviolent campaign in great number, even after Dr. King made a personal appearance on March 1.\\"1965 ‚Äì Cracking Lowndes\\". Civil Rights Movement Veterans website Overall more than 3,000 people were arrested in protests between January 1 and February 7, but blacks achieved fewer than 100 new registered voters. In addition, hundreds of people were injured or blacklisted by employers due to their participation in the campaign. DCLV activists became increasingly wary of SCLC's protests, preferring to wait and see if Judge Thomas' ruling of February 4 would make a long-term difference. SCLC was less concerned with Dallas County's immediate registration figures, and primarily focused on creating a public crisis that would make a voting rights bill the White House's number one priority. James Bevel and C. T. Vivian both led dramatic nonviolent confrontations at the courthouse in the second week of February. Selma students organized themselves after the SCLC leaders were arrested.\\"1965-Bound in Jail; Clubs and Cattleprods; Holding on and Pushing Forward\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and TimelineDavid Garrow, Protest at Selma (Yale University Press, 1978), p. 58. King told his staff on February 10 that \\"to get the bill passed, we need to make a dramatic appeal through Lowndes and other counties because the people of Selma are tired.\\"David J. Garrow, Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr and Southern Christian Leadership Conference (Jonathan Cape, 1988), p. 389. By the end of the month, 300 blacks were registered in Selma, compared to 9500 whites. First Selma-to-Montgomery march Jimmie Lee Jackson's murder On February 18, 1965, C. T. Vivian led a march to the courthouse in Marion, the county seat of neighboring Perry County, to protest the arrest of James Orange. State officials had received orders to target Vivian, and a line of Alabama state troopers waited for the marchers at the Perry County courthouse.Halberstam, David. The Children, Random House, 1998, p. 502. Officials had turned off all of the nearby street lights, and state troopers rushed at the protesters, attacking them. Protesters Jimmie Lee Jackson and his mother fled the scene to hide in a nearby caf√©. Alabama State Trooper corporal James Bonard Fowler followed Jackson into the caf√© and shot him, saying he thought the protester was trying to get his gun as they grappled. Jackson died eight days later at Selma's Good Samaritan Hospital, of an infection resulting from the gunshot wound. Jackson was the only male wage- earner of his household, which lived in extreme poverty. Jackson's father, mother, wife, and children were left with no source of income. Initiation and goals of the march During a public meeting at Zion United Methodist Church in Marion on February 28 after Jackson's death, emotions were running high. James Bevel, as director of the Selma voting rights movement for SCLC, called for a march from Selma to Montgomery to talk to Governor George Wallace directly about Jackson's death, and to ask him if he had ordered the State Troopers to turn off the lights and attack the marchers. Bevel strategized that this would focus the anger and pain of the people of Marion and Selma toward a nonviolent goal, as many were so outraged they wanted to retaliate with violence.Kryn in Garrow, 1989.Kryn, 2005. The marchers also hoped to bring attention to the continued violations of their Constitutional rights by marching to Montgomery. Dr. King agreed with Bevel's plan of the march, which they both intended to symbolize a march for full voting rights. They were to ask Governor Wallace to protect black registrants. SNCC had severe reservations about the march, especially when they heard that King would not be present. They permitted John Lewis to participate, and SNCC provided logistical support, such as the use of its Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) lines and the services of the Medical Committee on Human Rights, organized by SNCC during the Mississippi Summer Project of 1964.\\"Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Alabama (SNCC)\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama. Governor Wallace denounced the march as a threat to public safety; he said that he would take all measures necessary to prevent it from happening. \\"There will be no march between Selma and Montgomery,\\" Wallace said on March 6, 1965, citing concern over traffic violations. He ordered Alabama Highway Patrol Chief Col. Al Lingo to \\"use whatever measures are necessary to prevent a march\\".  \\"Bloody Sunday\\" events  On March 7, 1965, an estimated 525 to 600 civil rights marchers headed southeast out of Selma on U.S. Highway 80. The march was led by John Lewis of SNCC and the Reverend Hosea Williams of SCLC, followed by Bob Mants of SNCC and Albert Turner of SCLC. The protest went according to plan until the marchers passed by a Lehman Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealership and crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they encountered a wall of state troopers and county posse waiting for them on the other side blocking parts of U.S. Route 80 and a John Deere dealership, located at the 100th to 212th block of U.S. Route 80 East between Haisten's Mattress & Awning Company, an used-car dealership, Selma's Curb Market, Selma's Glass House restaurant, and a 15-cent Hamburgers drive-in restaurant. County sheriff Jim Clark had issued an order for all white males in Dallas County over the age of twenty- one to report to the courthouse that morning to be deputized. Commanding officer John Cloud told the demonstrators to disband at once and go home. Rev. Hosea Williams tried to speak to the officer, but Cloud curtly informed him there was nothing to discuss. Seconds later, the troopers began shoving the demonstrators, knocking many to the ground and beating them with nightsticks. Another detachment of troopers fired tear gas, and mounted troopers charged the crowd on horseback.\\"The Cost\\", We Shall Overcome: Historic Places of the Civil Rights Movement, National Park Service.Gary May, Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy (Basic Books, 2013). Televised images of the brutal attack presented Americans and international audiences with horrifying images of marchers left bloodied and severely injured, and roused support for the Selma Voting Rights Campaign. Amelia Boynton, who had helped organize the march as well as marching in it, was beaten unconscious. A photograph of her lying on the road of the Edmund Pettus Bridge appeared on the front page of newspapers and news magazines around the world.\\"The wire photo of her left for dead on Edmund Pettus Bridge, which went around the world on the news that night, helped spark the outpouring of support for the civil rights movement...\\", Schiller Institute. Another marcher, Lynda Blackmon Lowery, age 14, was brutally beaten by a police officer during the march, and needed seven stitches for a cut above her right eye and 28 stitches on the back of her head. John Lewis suffered a skull fracture. and he bore scars on his head from the incident for the rest of his life. In all, 17 marchers were hospitalized and 50 treated for lesser injuries; the day soon became known as \\"Bloody Sunday\\" within the black community. Response to \\"Bloody Sunday\\" After the march, President Johnson issued an immediate statement \\"deploring the brutality with which a number of Negro citizens of Alabama were treated\\". He also promised to send a voting rights bill to Congress that week, although it took him until March 15. SNCC officially joined the Selma campaign, putting aside their qualms about SCLC's tactics in order to rally for \\"the fundamental right of protest\\".Taylor Branch, At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years 1965‚Äì1968 (Simon & Schuster, 2006), p. 73. SNCC members independently organized sit-ins in Washington, DC, the following day, occupying the office of Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach until they were dragged away.Branch, At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years 1965‚Äì1968 (2006), pp. 59‚Äì65. The Executive Board of the NAACP unanimously passed a resolution the day after \\"Bloody Sunday\\", warning, > If Federal troops are not made available to protect the rights of Negroes, > then the American people are faced with terrible alternatives. Like the > citizens of Nazi-occupied France, Negroes must either submit to the heels of > their oppressors or they must organize underground to protect themselves > from the oppression of Governor Wallace and his storm troopers.\\"Selma > Outrage Condemned\\", The Crisis, Vol. 72, No. 4, April 1965. In response to \\"Bloody Sunday,\\" labor leader Walter Reuther sent a telegram on March 9 to President Johnson, reading in part: > Americans of all religious faiths, of all political persuasions, and from > every section of our Nation are deeply shocked and outraged at the tragic > events in Selma Ala., and they look to the Federal Government as the only > possible source to protect and guarantee the exercise of constitutional > rights, which is being denied and destroyed by the Dallas County law > enforcement agents and the Alabama State troops under the direction of > Governor George Wallace. Under these circumstances, Mr President, I join in > urging you to take immediate and appropriate steps including the use of > Federal marshals and troops if necessary, so that the full exercise of > constitutional rights including free assembly and free speech be fully > protected. Second march: \\"Turnaround Tuesday\\" Bevel, King, Nash, and others began organizing a second march to be held on Tuesday, March 9, 1965. They issued a call for clergy and citizens from across the country to join them. Awakened to issues of civil and voting rights by years of Civil Rights Movement activities, and shocked by the television images of \\"Bloody Sunday,\\" hundreds of people responded to SCLC's call. To prevent another outbreak of violence, SCLC attempted to gain a court order that would prohibit the police from interfering. Instead of issuing the court order, U.S. District Court Judge Frank Minis Johnson issued a restraining order, prohibiting the march from taking place until he could hold additional hearings later in the week. Based on past experience, some in SCLC were confident that Judge Johnson would eventually lift the restraining order. They did not want to alienate one of the few southern judges who had displayed sympathy to their cause by violating his injunction. In addition, they did not yet have sufficient infrastructure in place to support the long march, one for which the marchers were ill- equipped. They knew that violating a court order could result in punishment for contempt, even if the order is later reversed.See Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307 1967, citing Howat v. Kansas, 258 U.S. 181 (1922). But some movement activists, both local and from around the country, were determined to march on Tuesday to protest both the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" violence and the systematic denial of black voting rights in Alabama. Both Hosea Williams and James Forman argued that the march must proceed and by the early morning of the march date, and after much debate, Dr. King had decided to lead people to Montgomery. Assistant Attorney General John Doar and former Florida governor LeRoy Collins, representing President Lyndon Johnson, went to Selma to meet with King and others at Richie Jean Jackson's house and privately urged King to postpone the march. The SCLC president told them that his conscience demanded that he proceed, and that many movement supporters, especially in SNCC, would go ahead with the march even if he told them it should be called off. Collins suggested to King that he make a symbolic witness at the bridge, then turn around and lead the marchers back to Selma. King told them that he would try to enact the plan provided that Collins could ensure that law enforcement would not attack them. Collins obtained this guarantee from Sheriff Clark and Al Lingo in exchange for a guarantee that King would follow a precise route drawn up by Clark.David Garrow, Bearing the Cross (Vintage edition, 1993), pp. 401‚Äì405. Police watch marchers turn around on Tuesday, March 9, 1965. On the morning of March 9, a day that would become known as \\"Turnaround Tuesday\\", Collins handed Dr. King the secretly agreed route. King led about 2,500 marchers out on the Edmund Pettus Bridge and held a short prayer session before turning them around, thereby obeying the court order preventing them from making the full march, and following the agreement made by Collins, Lingo, and Clark. He did not venture across the border into the unincorporated area of the county, even though the police unexpectedly stood aside to let them enter.Eliza Berman, \\"How a Little-Known Government Agency Kept the Peace in Selma\\", Time, March 25, 2015. As only SCLC leaders had been told in advance of the plan, many marchers felt confusion and consternation, including those who had traveled long distances to participate and oppose police brutality. King asked them to remain in Selma for another march to take place after the injunction was lifted. That evening, three white Unitarian Universalist ministers in Selma for the march were attacked on the street and beaten with clubs by four KKK members.The March to Montgomery ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans. The worst injured was Reverend James Reeb from Boston. Fearing that Selma's public hospital would refuse to treat Reeb, activists took him to Birmingham's University Hospital, two hours away. Reeb died on Thursday, March 11 at University Hospital, with his wife by his side. Response to the second march James Reeb's death provoked mourning throughout the country, and tens of thousands held vigils in his honor. President Johnson called Reeb's widow and father to express his condolences (he would later invoke Reeb's memory when he delivered a draft of the Voting Rights Act to Congress). Blacks in Dallas County and the Black Belt mourned the death of Reeb, as they had earlier mourned the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson. But many activists were bitter that the media and national political leaders expressed great concern over the murder of Reeb, a northern white in Selma, but had paid scant attention to that of Jackson, a local African American. SNCC organizer Stokely Carmichael argued that \\"the movement itself is playing into the hands of racism, because what you want as a nation is to be upset when anybody is killed [but] for it to be recognized, a white person must be killed. Well, what are you saying?\\"\\"Bridge to Freedom\\" episode, Eyes on the Prize series, PBS_WGBH. Monument for James Reeb in Selma, Alabama Dr. King's credibility in the movement was shaken by the secret turnaround agreement. David Garrow notes that King publicly \\"waffled and dissembled\\" on how his final decision had been made. On some occasions King would inaccurately claim that \\"no pre-arranged agreement existed\\", but under oath before Judge Johnson, he acknowledged that there had been a \\"tacit agreement\\". Criticism of King by radicals in the movement became increasingly pronounced, with James Forman calling Turnaround Tuesday, \\"a classic example of trickery against the people\\". = James Reeb's memorial service = Following the death of James Reeb, a memorial service was held at the Brown's Chapel AME Church on March 15. Among those who addressed the packed congregation were Dr. King, labor leader Walter Reuther, and some clergymen. A picture of King, Reuther, Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos and others in Selma for Reeb's memorial service appeared on the cover of Life magazine on March 26, 1965. After the memorial service, upon getting permission from the courts, the leaders and attendees marched from the Brown's Chapel AME Church to the Dallas County Courthouse in Selma. =Actions in Montgomery= James Forman in Montgomery, March 1965 With the second march turned and its organizers awaiting a judicial order to safely proceed, Tuskegee Institute students, led by Gwen Patton and Sammy Younge Jr., decided to open a \\"Second Front\\" by marching to the Alabama State Capitol and delivering a petition to Governor Wallace. They were quickly joined by James Forman and much of the SNCC staff from Selma. The SNCC members distrusted King more than ever after the \\"turnaround\\", and were eager to take a separate course. On March 11, SNCC began a series of demonstrations in Montgomery, and put out a national call for others to join them. James Bevel, SCLC's Selma leader, followed them and discouraged their activities, bringing him and SCLC into conflict with Forman and SNCC. Bevel accused Forman of trying to divert people from the Selma campaign and of abandoning nonviolent discipline. Forman accused Bevel of driving a wedge between the student movement and the local black churches. The argument was resolved only when both were arrested.\\"1965-Students March in Montgomery; Confrontation at Dexter Church\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline. On March 15 and 16, SNCC led several hundred demonstrators, including Alabama students, Northern students, and local adults, in protests near the capitol complex. The Montgomery County sheriff's posse met them on horseback and drove them back, whipping them. Against the objections of James Bevel, some protesters threw bricks and bottles at police. At a mass meeting on the night of the 16th, Forman \\"whipped the crowd into a frenzy\\" demanding that the President act to protect demonstrators, and warned, \\"If we can't sit at the table of democracy, we'll knock the fucking legs off.\\"Gary May, Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy (Basic Books, 2013), pp. 107, 126.\\"1965-Protests and Police Violence Continue in Montgomery; Brutal Attack in Montgomery\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline. The New York Times featured the Montgomery confrontations on the front page the next day.\\"1965-Wednesday, March 17\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline. Although Dr. King was concerned by Forman's violent rhetoric, he joined him in leading a march of 2000 people in Montgomery to the Montgomery County courthouse. SNCC protesters in Montgomery, March 17, 1965 According to historian Gary May, \\"City officials, also worried by the violent turn of events ... apologized for the assault on SNCC protesters and invited King and Forman to discuss how to handle future protests in the city.\\" In the negotiations, Montgomery officials agreed to stop using the county posse against protesters, and to issue march permits to blacks for the first time.May, Bending Toward Justice (2013), p. 129. Governor Wallace did not negotiate, however. He continued to have state police arrest any demonstrators who ventured onto Alabama State property of the capitol complex. =Actions at the White House= On March 11, seven Selma solidarity activists sat-in at the East Wing of the White House until arrested. Dozens of other protesters also tried to occupy the White House that weekend but were stopped by guards; they blocked Pennsylvania Avenue instead. On March 12, President Johnson had an unusually belligerent meeting with a group of civil rights advocates including Bishop Paul Moore, Reverend Robert Spike, and SNCC representative H. Rap Brown. Johnson complained that the White House protests were disturbing his family. The activists were unsympathetic and demanded to know why he hadn't delivered the voting rights bill to Congress yet, or sent federal troops to Alabama to protect the protesters.Ekwueme Michael Thelwell, \\"H. Rap Brown/ Jamil Al-Amin: A Profoundly American Story\\", The Nation, February 28, 2002.Branch, At Canaan's Edge, p. 93. In this same period, SNCC, CORE, and other groups continued to organize protests in more than eighty cities, actions that included 400 people blocking the entrances and exits of the Los Angeles Federal Building.Gary May, Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy, (Basic Books, 2013), p. 94. President Johnson told the press that he refused to be \\"blackjacked\\" into action by unruly \\"pressure groups\\".Robert Young, \\"Johnson won't be 'blackjacked into force by pressure groups, Chicago Tribune, March 13, 1965. The next day he arranged a personal meeting with Governor Wallace, urging him to use the Alabama National Guard to protect marchers. He also began preparing the final draft of his voting rights bill. On March 11, Attorney General Katzenbach announced that the federal government was intending to prosecute local and state officials who were responsible for the attacks on the marchers on March 7.John D. Pomfret, \\"US to Prosecute Police Over Gas Attack\\", The New York Times, March 12, 1965. Retrieved March 11, 2015. He would use an 1870 civil rights law as the basis for charges. =Johnson's decision and the Voting Rights Act= On March 15, the president convened a joint session of Congress, outlined his new voting rights bill, and demanded that they pass it. In a historic presentation carried nationally on live television, making use of the largest media network, Johnson praised the courage of African-American activists. He called Selma \\"a turning point in man's unending search for freedom\\" on a par with the Battle of Appomattox in the American Civil War. Johnson added that his entire Great Society program, not only the voting rights bill, was part of the Civil Rights Movement. He adopted language associated with Dr. King, declaring that \\"it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.\\"\\"President Lyndon B. Johnson's Special Message to the Congress: The American Promise, March 15, 1965\\" , (As delivered in person before a joint session at 9:02 p.m.) Afterward, King sent a telegram to Johnson congratulating him for his speech, calling it \\"the most moving eloquent unequivocal and passionate plea for human rights ever made by any president of this nation\\". Johnson's voting rights bill was formally introduced in Congress two days later.

Heschel later wrote, \\"When I marched in Selma, my feet were praying.\\" Joseph Ellwanger is standing in the second row behind the nun. A week after Reeb's death, on Wednesday March 17, Judge Johnson ruled in favor of the protesters, saying their First Amendment right to march in protest could not be abridged by the state of Alabama: > The law is clear that the right to petition one's government for the redress > of grievances may be exercised in large groups . ... These rights may ... be > exercised by marching, even along public highways.Williams v. Wallace, 240 > F. Supp. 100, 106 (M.D. Ala. 1960). Judge Johnson had sympathized with the protesters for some days, but had withheld his order until he received an iron-clad commitment of enforcement from the White House. President Johnson had avoided such a commitment in sensitivity to the power of the state's rights movement, and attempted to cajole Governor Wallace into protecting the marchers himself, or at least giving the president permission to send troops. Finally, seeing that Wallace had no intention of doing either, the president gave his commitment to Judge Johnson on the morning of March 17, and the judge issued his order the same day.Gary May, Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy (Basic Books, 2013), pp. 127‚Äì128. To ensure that this march would not be as unsuccessful as the first two marches were, the president federalized the Alabama National Guard on March 20 to escort the march from Selma,Dallek, Robert (1998). Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973. Oxford University Press, p. 218. The ground operation was supervised by Deputy U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark.Gary May, Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy (Basic Books, 2013), p. 130 He also sent Joseph A Califano Jr., who at the time served as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, to outline the progress of the march. In a series of letters, Califano reported on the march at regular intervals for the four days. \\\\- Califano Reports. On Sunday, March 21, close to 8,000 people assembled at Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church to commence the trek to Montgomery.Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail ‚Äì National Park Service. Most of the participants were black, but some were white and some were Asian and Latino. Spiritual leaders of multiple races, religions, and creeds marched abreast with Dr. King, including Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos, Rabbis Abraham Joshua Heschel and Maurice Davis, and at least one nun, all of whom were depicted in a photo that has become famous. The Dutch Catholic priest Henri Nouwen joined the march on March 24.Nouwen, Henri (2008). The Road to Peace, p. 84-85. Orbis, New York. . In 1965, the road to Montgomery was four lanes wide going east from Selma, then narrowed to two lanes through Lowndes County, and widened to four lanes again at the Montgomery county border. Under the terms of Judge Johnson's order, the march was limited to no more than 300 participants for the two days they were on the two-lane portion of Highway-80. At the end of the first day, most of the marchers returned to Selma by bus and car, leaving 300 to camp overnight and take up the journey the next day. On March 22 and 23, 300 protesters marched through chilling rain across Lowndes County, camping at three sites in muddy fields. At the time of the march, the population of Lowndes County was 81% black and 19% white, but not a single black was registered to vote. There were 2,240 whites registered to vote in Lowndes County,https://libraries.ucsd.edu/farmworkermovement/ufwarchives/sncc/13-June%201966.pdf a figure that represented 118% of the adult white population (in many Southern counties of that era it was common practice to retain white voters on the rolls after they died or moved away). On March 23, Hundreds of black marchers wore kippot, Jewish skullcaps, to emulate the marching rabbis, as Heschel was marching at the front of the crowd. The marchers called the kippot \\"freedom caps.\\" On the morning of March 24, the march crossed into Montgomery County and the highway widened again to four lanes. All day as the march approached the city, additional marchers were ferried by bus and car to join the line. By evening, several thousand marchers had reached the final campsite at the City of St. Jude, a complex on the outskirts of Montgomery. That night on a makeshift stage, a \\"Stars for Freedom\\" rally was held, with singers Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett, Frankie Laine, Peter, Paul and Mary, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joan Baez, Nina Simone, and The Chad Mitchell Trio all performing. Thousands more people continued to join the march. On Thursday, March 25, 25,000 people marched from St. Jude to the steps of the State Capitol Building where King delivered the speech How Long, Not Long. He said: > The end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live > with its conscience. ... I know you are asking today, How long will it take? > I come to say to you this afternoon however difficult the moment, however > frustrating the hour, it will not be long. After delivering the speech, King and the marchers approached the entrance to the capitol with a petition for Governor Wallace. A line of state troopers blocked the door. One announced that the governor was not in. Undeterred, the marchers remained at the entrance until one of Wallace's secretaries appeared and took the petition.Mallon, Jack (March 6, 2015). \\"Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and demonstrators reach Montgomery from Selma in 1965\\". Daily News (New York). Later that night, Viola Liuzzo, a white mother of five from Detroit who had come to Alabama to support voting rights for blacks, was assassinated by Ku Klux Klan members while she was ferrying marchers back to Selma from Montgomery. Among the Klansmen in the car from which the shots were fired was FBI informant Gary Rowe. Afterward, the FBI's COINTELPRO operation spread false rumors that Liuzzo was a member of the Communist Party and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African-American activists.Mary Stanton, FROM SELMA TO SORROW: The Life and Death of Viola Liuzzo, University of Georgia Press, 2000. Response to the third march  The third Selma march received national and international coverage. It was reported that it publicized the marchers' message without harassment by police and segregation supporters. Gaining more widespread support from other civil rights organizations in the area, this third march was considered an overall success, with greater degree of influence on the public. Subsequently, voter registration drives were organized in black-majority areas across the South, but it took time to get the target population to sign up. U.S. Representative William Louis Dickinson made two speeches to Congress on March 30 and April 27, saying that there was alcohol abuse, bribery, and widespread sexual license among the marchers. Religious leaders present at the marches denied the allegations, and local and national journalists found no grounds for his accounts. The allegations of segregation supporters were collected in Robert M. Mikell's pro-segregationist book Selma (Charlotte, 1965).Jane Daily, \\"Sex, Segregation, and the Sacred after Brown\\", The Journal of American History, 91.1. Note: Mikkel's book was published with a colorized cover photograph showing splotches of blood drawn on an image of Viola Liuzzo's car. Hammermill boycott During 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. was promoting an economic boycott of Alabama products to put pressure on the State to integrate schools and employment.Fredrick, Stand Up for Alabama, p. 126. In an action under development for some time, Hammermill paper company announced the opening of a major plant in Selma, Alabama; this came during the height of violence in early 1965. On February 4, 1965, the company announced plans for construction of a $35 million plant, allegedly touting the \\"fine reports the company had received about the character of the community and its people\\". On March 26, 1965, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee called for a national boycott of Hammermill paper products, until the company reversed what SNCC described as racist policies. The SCLC joined in support of the boycott. Negro Boycott of Hammermill. Jet, May 27, 1965. In cooperation with SCLC, student members of Oberlin College Action for Civil Rights, joined with SCLC members to conduct picketing and a sit-in at Hammermill's Erie, Pennsylvania headquarters. The company called a meeting of the corporate leadership, SCLC's C.T. Vivian, and Oberlin student leadership. Their discussions led to Hammermill executives signing an agreement to support integration in Alabama.The Best Known Name in Paper, Hammermill , Pennsylvania State University. Aftermath and historical impact Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail sign speech marking the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches Memorial at Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama The marches had a powerful effect in Washington. After witnessing TV coverage of \\"Bloody Sunday\\", President Lyndon Baines Johnson met with Governor George Wallace in Washington to discuss the civil rights situation in his state. He tried to persuade Wallace to stop the state harassment of the protesters. Two nights later, on March 15, 1965, Johnson presented a bill to a joint session of Congress. The bill was passed that summer and signed by Johnson as the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965. Johnson's televised speech before Congress was carried nationally; it was considered to be a watershed moment for the civil rights movement. He said: > Even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in > Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and > state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for > themselves the full blessings of American life. Their cause must be our > cause, too, because it is not just Negroes but really it is all of us who > must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall > overcome. Many in the Civil Rights Movement cheered the speech and were emotionally moved that after so long, and so hard a struggle, a President was finally willing to defend voting rights for blacks. According to C.T. Vivian, an SCLC activist who was with King at Richie Jean Jackson's home when the speech was broadcast, > I looked over ... and Martin was very quietly sitting in the chair, and a > tear ran down his cheek. It was a victory like none other. It was an > affirmation of the movement. Many others in the movement remained skeptical of the White House, believing that Johnson was culpable for having allowed violence against the movement in the early months of the campaign and was not a reliable supporter. Neither Jimmie Lee Jackson's murderer, nor Reverend Reeb's was ever prosecuted by the federal government.\\"1965-President Johnson: We Shall Overcome\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline.\\"FBI investigating '65 killing of pro- civil rights minister\\", The Grio. J.L. Chestnut, reflecting the view of many Selma activists, feared that the president had \\"outfoxed\\" and \\"co-opted\\" King and the SCLC. James Forman quipped that by quoting \\"We Shall Overcome\\", Johnson had simply \\"spoiled a good song\\".Gary May, Bending Toward Justice, p. 125. Such grassroots activists were more determined than ever to remain independent in their political organizing. Before the march to Montgomery concluded, SNCC staffers Stokely Carmichael and Cleveland Sellers committed themselves to registering voters in Lowndes County for the next year. Their efforts resulted in the creation of the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, an independent third party.\\"Stokely Carmichael\\". King Encyclopedia.\\"Eyes on the Prize II: Interview with Cleveland Sellers\\", Washington University Digital Gateway. The bill was signed by President Johnson in an August 6 ceremony attended by Amelia Boynton and many other civil rights leaders and activists. This act prohibited most of the unfair practices used to prevent blacks from registering to vote, and provided for federal registrars to go to Alabama and other states with a history of voting-related discrimination to ensure that the law was implemented by overseeing registration and elections. In the early years of the Act, overall progress was slow, with local registrars continuing to use their power to deny African Americans voting access. In most Alabama counties, for example, registration continued to be limited to two days per month.\\"1965-SCOPE Voter Registration\\". Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline].

The Civil Rights Commission described this as a major contribution to expanding black voters in 1965, and the Justice Department acknowledged leaning on the work of \\"local organizations\\" in the movement to implement the Act. SCLC and SNCC were temporarily able to mend past differences through collaboration in the Summer Community Organization & Political Education project. Ultimately, their coalition foundered on SCLC's commitment to nonviolence and (at the time) the Democratic Party.\\"1965-SCLC/SCOPE and SNCC\\". Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline. Many activists worried that President Johnson still sought to appease Southern whites, and some historians support this view.\\"1965-SCOPE\\".

By March 1966, nearly 11,000 blacks had registered to vote in Selma, where 12,000 whites were registered. More blacks would register by November, when their goal was to replace County Sheriff Jim Clark; his opponent was Wilson Baker, for whom they had respect. In addition, five blacks ran for office in Dallas County. Rev. P. H. Lewis, pastor of Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, ran for state representative on the Democratic ticket. David Ellwanger, a brother of Rev. Joseph Ellwanger of Birmingham, who led supporters in Selma in 1965, challenged incumbent state senator Walter C. Givhan (d. 1976), a fierce segregationist and a power in the state senate. First elected to the state senate in 1954, Givhan retained his seat for six terms, even after redistricting that preceded the 1966 election.\\"Walter C. Givhan\\", Auburn University, 2015, accessed 12 March 2015 In November 1966, Katzenbach told Johnson regarding Alabama, that \\"I am attempting to do the least I can do safely without upsetting the civil rights groups.\\" Katzenbach did concentrate examiners and observers in Selma for the \\"high-visibility\\" election between incumbent County Sheriff Jim Clark and Wilson Baker, who had earned the grudging respect of many local residents and activists.Taylor Branch, At Canaan's Edge, p. 461 With 11,000 blacks added to the voting rolls in Selma by March 1966, they voted for Baker in 1966, turning Clark out of office. Clark later was prosecuted and convicted of drug smuggling and served a prison sentence. The US Civil Rights Commission said that the murders of activists, such as Jonathan Daniels in 1965, had been a major impediment to voter registration. Overall, the Justice Department assigned registrars to six of Alabama's 24 Black Belt counties during the late 1960s, and to fewer than one-fifth of all the Southern counties covered by the Act. Expansion of enforcement grew gradually, and the jurisdiction of the Act was expanded through a series of amendments beginning in 1970. An important change was made in 1972, when Congress passed an amendment that discrimination could be determined by \\"effect\\" rather than by trying to prove \\"intent\\". Thus, if county or local practices resulted in a significant minority population being unable to elect candidates of their choice, the practices were considered to be discriminatory in effect. In 1960, there were a total of 53,336 black voters registered in the state of Alabama; three decades later, there were 537,285,Selma-to-Montgomery 1965 Voting Rights March ‚Äì Alabama Department of Archives & History. a tenfold increase. Legacy and honors *In 1996, the 54-mile Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail was designated and is preserved by the National Park Service.\\"History and Culture: Selma-to- Montgomery National Historic Trail, National Park Service. As part of the National Historic Trail, the National Park Service operates two interpretive centers (Selma and Lowndes County). It is planning to operate a Montgomery center to be located on the campus of Alabama State University. *In February 2015, both houses of Congress voted for a resolution to award Congressional Gold Medals to the \\"foot soldiers\\" of the Selma campaign. In a later ceremony, two dozen individuals in Selma received certificates.Ari Berman, \\"Fifty Years After Bloody Sunday in Selma, Everything and Nothing Has Changed\\", The Nation, 25 February 2015, accessed 12 March 2015 Barack Obama signed the resolution in law on March 7. The award ceremony officially took place on February 24, 2016, at the US Capitol. Surviving marchers John Lewis and Frederick Reese accepted medals on behalf of the Selma marchers Commemorative marches Since 1965, many marches have commemorated the events of Bloody Sunday, usually held on or around the anniversary of the original event, and currently known as the Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee. In March 1975, Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., led four thousand marchers commemorating Bloody Sunday. On its 30th anniversary, Rep. John Lewis, former president of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and a prominent activist during the Selma to Montgomery marches, said, \\"It's gratifying to come back and see the changes that have occurred; to see the number of registered voters and the number of Black elected officials in the state of Alabama to be able to walk with other members of Congress that are African Americans.\\" On the 40th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, over 10,000 people, including Lewis, again marched across Edmund Pettus Bridge. Also, in 1996, the Olympic torch made its way across the bridge with its carrier, Andrew Young, along with many public officials, to symbolize how far the South has come. When Young spoke at the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church as part of the torch ceremony, he said, \\"We couldn't have gone to Atlanta with the Olympic Games if we hadn't come through Selma a long time ago.\\" In March 2015, on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, U.S. President Barack Obama, the first African-American U.S. president, delivered a speech at the foot of the bridge and then, along with other U.S. political figures such as former U.S. President George W. Bush and Representative John Lewis and Civil Rights Movement activists such as Amelia Boynton Robinson (at Obama's side in a wheelchair), led a march across the bridge. An estimated 40,000 people attended to commemorate the 1965 march, and to reflect on and speak about its impact on history and continuing efforts to address and improve U.S. civil rights. After John Lewis died in July 2020, he managed to cross the bridge one last time when his casket, which was carried by a horse-drawn caisson, crossed along the same route he walked during the Bloody Sunday march. Revitalization Montgomery was one of four state capitals chosen for a Greening Americas Capitals Grant, a project of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Beginning in 2011, EPA and community groups developed the study through consultations and a 3-day design workshops, aided by nationally acclaimed urban planners.\\"Greening the Selma to Montgomery Trail: Reconnecting and Remembering\\", Greening American Capitals, EPA. The Montgomery portion of the Selma to Montgomery trail was being improved through a multimillion-dollar investment in order to enhance the trail and related neighborhoods. The city chose a section that passes through a \\"historically significant African-American neighborhood\\". Projects planned to improve design and sustainability include infill development, resurfacing, pedestrian improvements, environmental improvements including new trees and green- screens, and drainage improvements. In addition, many information panels have been installed, as well as several permanent public art displays that are tied to the march. The work in Montgomery is related to a larger multi-agency effort since 2009 between the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), EPA and the National Park Service to improve areas along the National Historic Voting Rights Trail to enable local communities to thrive. The US 80 corridor has been described in an EPA summary as a \\"54-mile corridor of high unemployment, health issues, lower educational and economic achievements, and severe rural isolation\\". Among the serious environmental issues identified by EPA has been the presence of active and abandoned gas stations along the highway, with potential contamination from petroleum leaks from underground storage sites. A site in Montgomery had been identified as a problem, and EPA conducted additional assessments since the beginning of the project. Cleanup of the Montgomery site was scheduled to be completed in 2011. In addition, the agencies have sponsored community engagement to develop plans related to community goals. Since 2010, federal teams have met with community leaders in Selma, Hayneville and Montgomery, the county seats of Dallas, Lowndes and Montgomery counties.\\"Community Engagement At Leaking Underground Storage Tank Sites: National Historic Voting Rights Trail Selma To Montgomery, Alabama\\", EPA, 9 July 2010.

Clarke. The story was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories published before the creation of the Nebula Awards. It was reprinted in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929‚Äì1964. Plot summary In a Tibetan lamasery, the monks seek to list all of the names of God. They believe the Universe was created for this purpose, and that once this naming is completed, God will bring the Universe to an end. Three centuries ago, the monks created an alphabet in which they calculated they could encode all the possible names of God, numbering about 9,000,000,000 (\\"nine billion\\") and each having no more than nine characters. Writing the names out by hand, as they had been doing, even after eliminating various nonsense combinations, would take another 15,000 years; the monks wish to use modern technology to finish this task more quickly. They rent a computer capable of printing all the possible permutations, and they hire two Westerners to install and program the machine. The computer operators are skeptical but play along. After three months, as the job nears completion, they fear that the monks will blame the computer, and by extension its operators, when nothing happens. The Westerners delay the operation of the computer so that it will complete its final print run just after their scheduled departure. After their successful departure on ponies, they pause on the mountain path on their way back to the airfield, where a plane is waiting to take them back to civilization. Under a clear night sky they estimate that it must be just about the time that the monks are pasting the final printed names into their holy books. Then they notice that \\"overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.\\" Reception In 2004, \\"The Nine Billion Names of God\\" won the retrospective Hugo Award for Best Short Story for the year 1954.1954 Retro Hugo Awards, at TheHugoAwards.org; retrieved January 14, 2017 Kirkus Reviews called it \\"quietly remarkable\\"THE NINE BILLION NAMES OF GOD - THE BEST SHORT STORIES by Arthur C.

There she met and fell in love with George Osmond. They married on December 1, 1944. Their first two children, Virl and Tom, were born with a degenerative condition which left them nearly deaf. Doctors warned the couple that any other children would be at risk of inheriting the same disorder, but George and Olive wanted a large family.

It is also a generic description given to the infestation of a wooden item (normally part of a dwelling or the furniture in it) by these larvae. Types of woodworm Woodboring beetles with larvae commonly known as woodworm include: *Ambrosia beetles (weevils of the subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae) *Woodboring weevils (Pentarthrum huttoni and Euophryum confine) *Bark borer beetle or waney edge borer (Ernobius mollis) *Common furniture beetle (Anobium punctatum) *Deathwatch beetle (Xestobium rufovillosum) *House longhorn beetle (Hylotrupes bajulus) *Powderpost beetle (Lyctus brunneus) *Wharf borer (Narcerdes melanura) Manifestation Wood affected by woodworm Signs of woodworm usually consist of holes in the wooden item, with live infestations showing powder (faeces), known as frass, around the holes. The size of the holes varies, but are typically 1mm to 1.5mm in diameter for the most common household species, although they can be much larger in the case of the house longhorn beetle. Adult beetles that emerge from wood may also be found in the summer months. Typically the adult beetles lay eggs on or just under the surface of a wooden item. The resulting grubs then feed on the wooden item causing both structural and cosmetic damage. They then pupate and hatch as beetles that then breed, lay eggs and repeat the process, causing further damage. As these beetles are accustomed to consuming decaying wood in forests, most grubs will prefer wooden items that contain a higher moisture content than that of typical household items. A building with a woodworm problem in its structure or furniture may also have a problem with excess moisture. The issue could be the result of a lack of ventilation in a roof space, cellar or other enclosed space within an otherwise dry building. Whilst moisture is a leading factor resulting in a woodworm infestation, some species of woodboring insects, such as the woodboring weevil, are only found where fungal rot has already begun. Treatment Depending on the species involved, woodworm infestation is generally controlled with insecticides. However, some woodworm conditions, such as those caused by the waney edge borer (Ernobius mollis), require no treatment at all because the insect will have been killed in the preparation of the wood. Only active infestations require treatment, so it is important to ascertain whether an infestation is still active before treatment is carried out. It is also advisable to investigate and solve possible dampness issues, as dry wood is not usually affected, and wood that remains damp may be reinfected at a later date. Electrical insect killers, which attract and kill adult beetles before they can breed, may be used along with conventional chemical treatments to kill adult beetles before they can breed, but the effectiveness of such an approach is unknown. Freezing treatments are quite effective but are costly, take two to three weeks to work and may cause damage. Low-oxygen treatment is also effective but is costly and very time- consuming, taking as long as eight weeks to treat the problem. Consumption In places such as Cambodia, South Africa, the Philippines. Retrieved 2018-10-09. and Papua New Guinea, woodworms may be considered edible delicacies.

Overview Digital display advertising is an online form of advertising in which the company's promotional messages appear on third-party sites or search engine results pages such as publishers or social networks. There is an evidence showing that this advertising can increase the number of website page view of a company from most types of customers except from the non-authenticated visitors who visited the website before. The main purpose of display advertising is to support brand awareness (Robinson et al., 2007)Robinson et al (2007) 'Marketing communications using digital media channels', in Chaffey, D. and Chadwick, F. E. (2016) Digital Marketing: Strategy, Implementation, and Practice.Edinburgh Gate: Pearson Education Limited, pp. 515-522. and it also helps to increase the purchase intention of consumers. Social media is used by many organizations. One example is, in 2014, ASOS and Nike collaborated with Google Hangouts to create the first shoppable video web chat on Google+. The video is an example of display advertising used for commemorating 27 years of Nike's Air Max shoes. The video advertising aimed at creating brand awareness among users and convincing them to watch the Hangout and purchase products from the display advertising itself. Consumers were able to shop by clicking the display advertising. According to an ASOS statement, display advertising has contributed to an increase in both the number of users visiting its website and downloads of the ASOS App by 28 percent, with users having then visited the website eight times a month, on average.Albans, S. (2017) 'ASOS plc interim results for six months'. Available at: https://www.asosplc.com/~/media/Files/A/Asos-V2/results- archive/statement/interim-results-statement-04-04-2017.pdf. Retrieved 2017-05-11. History Since the early advent of technology, the Internet has completely changed the way people relate to advertisements. As computers prices decreased, online content became accessible to a large portion of the world's population. This change has modified the way people are exposed to media and advertising and has led to the creation of online channels through which advertisements can reach users. The first type of relationship between a website and an advertiser was a straightforward, direct partnership. This partnership model implies that the advertiser promoting a product or service pays the website (also known as a publisher) directly for a certain amount of ad impressions. As time went on, publishers began creating thousands of websites, leading to millions of pages with unsold ad space. This gave rise to a new set of companies called Ad Networks. The ad network acted as a broker, buying unsold ad space from multiple publishers and packaged them into audiences to be sold to advertisers. This second wave of advertiser-publisher relationships rapidly gained popularity as it was convenient and useful for buyers who often found themselves paying a lower price yet receiving enhanced targeting capabilities through ad networks. The third and most recent major development that shaped the advertiser-publisher ecosystem started occurring in the late 2000s when widespread adoption of RTB (real time bidding) technology took place. Also referred to as programmatic bidding, RTB allowed companies representing buyers and sellers to bid on the price to show an ad to a user every time a banner ad is loading. When a page loads during a user visit, there are thousands of bids occurring from advertisers to serve an ad to that user, based on each company's individual algorithms. With this most recent change in the industry, more and more ads are being sold on a single- impression basis, as opposed to in bulk purchases. Real time bidding (RTB) Programmatic display advertising, or real time bidding (RTB), transformed the way digital display advertising is bought and managed in recent years. Rather than placing a booking for advertising directly with a website, advertisers will manage their activity through a (demand side platform), and bid to advertise to people in real time, across multiple websites, based on targeting criteria. This method of advertising quickly gained popular, as it allows for more control for the advertiser (or agency), including of the individual target audience, rather than just the website. It has become a threat to website operators and generally the cost paid for advertising in this way is less than the old method and so the earning potential for them is reduced. Programmatic is not without its drawbacks, as without the appropriate management adverts can appear against unsavoury content or inappropriate news topics. This issue became front-page news in February 2017, when advertisers on YouTube were found displayed on terror group websites and fake news sites. As a result, a number of major advertisers paused all of their online advertising until they could put the appropriate measures in place to prevent this occurring again. First online advertisement The birthday of the first banner display on the World Wide Web was on 27 October 1994. It appeared on HotWired, the first commercial web magazine. The COCONET online service had graphical online banner ads starting in 1988 in San Diego, California. The PRODIGY service, launched also in 1988, had banner ads as well. Operations Accounts department The accounts department meet with the client to define campaign goals and translate those goals into a creative brief to be forwarded to the creative department. Creative department The role of the creative team is to conceptualise and create the advert. They have to develop a creative execution that will be compelling enough to drive a customer to buy a product or a service. The team often consists of a mix of copy writers and graphic designers who use their respective skillsets to communicate via copy and visuals. Media planner People have to test in which way the user experiences all the information of a data visualization. For this reason, they have to study the users' response to sounds, image, and motion. They have to be aware of everything that is digitally consumed, to know all the newest technologies and media solutions, and to help all the other departments to find the best way to reach the object's campaign. Ad operations Ad Operations, or 'Ad ops', are the people who ensure that the ad is physically delivered to the correct website at the correct time. They do this by uploading the ad into the advertiser's ad server so that it can be delivered to the website and displayed to the end user who will see it. Ad server Ad servers helps manage digital display advertisements. It is an advertising technology (ad tech) tool that, throughout a platform, administrates the ads and their distribution. It is basically a service or technology for a company that takes care of all the ad campaign programs and by receiving the ad files it is able to allocate them in different websites. The ad server is responsible for things such as the dates by which the campaign has to run on a website; the rapidity in which an ad as to be spread and where (geographic location targeting, language targeting.. ); controlling that an ad is not overseen by a user by limiting the number of visualisations; proposing an ad on past behaviour targeting. There are different types of ad servers. There is an ad server for publishers that helps them to launch a new ad on a website by listing the highest ads' price on its and to follow the ad's growth by registering how many users it has reached. There is an ad server for advertisers that helps them by sending the ads in the form of HTML codes to each publisher. In this way, it is possible to open the ad in every moment and make changes of frequency for example, at all times. Lastly, there is an ad server for ad networks that provides information as in which network the publisher is registering an income and which is the daily revenue. Importance of formats of display ads Two students of the \\"Amsterdam school of Communication Research ASCor\\" have run studies about the audience reactions to different display advertising formats. In particular, they took into consideration two different types of format (sponsored content and banner advertising) to demonstrate that people react and perceive formats in different ways, positive and negative. For this reason, it is important to choose the right format because it will help to make the most of the medium. It is also possible to add: * Video; * Rich Media Ads (Expandables): flash files that may expand when the user interacts on mouseover (polite), or auto- initiated (non-polite); * Overlays: ads that appear above content and that are possible to remove by clicking on a close button; * Interstitials: Ads that are displayed on web pages before expected content (before the target page is displayed on the user's screen); * Sponsorship: including a logo or adding a brand to the design of a website. This can also can fall under Native advertising, which is an ad that can seem like Editorial, or \\"In-Feed\\", but has really been paid for by the advertiser To help to better select the right format for the type of ad, Interactive Advertising Bureau has realized a Display Standard Ad Unit Portfolio that works as a guideline that can be followed by the creatives. *Vertical rectangle: 240 x 400 *Mobile leaderboard: 320 x 50 *Banner: 468 x 60 *Leaderboard: 728 x 90 *Square: 250 x 250 *Small square: 200 x 200 *Large rectangle: 336 x 280 *Inline rectangle: 300 x 250 *Skyscraper: 120 x 600 *Wide skyscraper: 160 x 600 *Half-page: 300 x 600 *Large leaderboard: 970x90 *Large mobile banner: 320 x 100 *Billboard: 970 x 250 *Portrait: 300 x 1050 thumbnail In 2017 IAB also introduced the new guidelines, featuring adjustable ad formats, as well as the guidelines for new digital content experiences such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), social media, mobile video, emoji ad messaging, and 360-degree video ads.

The sai (Èáµ) is a traditional okinawan melee weapon used for stabbing. It is used in ninjutsu and kobujutsu. The basic form of the weapon is that of a sharp metal prong with two curved sideprongs (yoku) projecting from the handle (tsuka). There are many different types of sai with varying prongs for trapping and blocking. History Before its arrival in Okinawa, the sai was already being used in other Asian countries including India, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It may have been brought to Okinawa from one or several of these places simultaneously. Based on the Indian trisula, early evidence in the form of Japanese art shows that the chabang predates the sai's use in Okinawa and China. The word trisula itself can refer to either a long or short-handled trident. Because the trisula was created in South Asia, it is possible that the sai originated in India and spread along with Hinduism and Buddhism. This is supported by the fact that the trisula is important as a Hindu-Buddhist symbol. In Okinawa the sai was used by domestic police (ufuchiku) to arrest criminals and for crowd control. Use of the sai in Japanese martial arts was improved in 1668 by Moto Chohei, an Okinawan prince.The Secret Royal Martial Arts of Ryukyu, Kanenori Sakon Matsuo, BoD ‚Äì Books on Demand, Mar 31, 2005 P.81 The sai eventually reached Japan in the form of the jitte, which usually has only a single prong although some jitte have two prongs like a sai. Both are like truncheon weapons, used for striking, bludgeoning, and also for multiple punctures over different positions on the body. Parts of the sai Tsuka of the Okinawan sai * Monouchi, the shaft of the sai, this can be round or faceted. * Yoku, the prong like side guards which are usually symmetrical but the manji design developed by Taira Shinken employs oppositely-facing yoku resembling the swastika (manji) from which it takes its name. * Tsume, the tip of the side guard (yoku). * Moto, the actual center point between the two side guards. * Tsuka, the handle of the sai. The tsuka can be wrapped with different materials such as cord or ray skin (same) to provide a grip. This tsuka is long. * Tsukagashira, the butt end of the handle (tsuka). * Saki, the tip or point of the sai which is usually blunt and not pointed.Black Belt, Aug 1993, Vol. 31, No. 8, p.51, , Published by Active Interest Media, Inc. Technique Manji design sai The sai is typically used in pairs, with one in each hand. Five kata are commonly taught, including two kihon kata. The utility of the sai as a weapon is reflected in its distinctive shape. It is a weapon used for fast jabs but it also has many defensive techniques. The style includes a variety of strikes, blocks, parries and captures against attackers from all directions and height levels. Use of the point, knuckle and central bar is emphasized, as well as rapid grip changes for multiple strikes and blocks. There are several different ways of wielding the sai, which give it the versatility to be used both lethally and non-lethally. One way to hold it is by gripping the handle with all of the fingers and pinching the thumb against the joint between the handle bar and the shaft. This allows one to manipulate the sai so that it can be pressed against the forearm and also help avoid getting the thumb caught in the handle when blocking an attack. The change is made by putting pressure on the thumbs and rotating the sai around until it is facing backwards and the index finger is aligned with the handle. The knuckle end is good for concentrating the force of a punch, while the long shaft can be wielded to thrust at enemies, to serve as a protection for a blow to the forearm, or to stab as one would use a common dagger. In practice, some prefer to keep the index finger extended in alignment with the center shaft regardless of whether the knuckle end or the middle prong is exposed. The finger may be straight or slightly curled. Used in this way, the other fingers are kept on the main shaft, with the thumb supporting the handle. The grips described above leverage the versatility of this implement as both an offensive and a defensive weapon. Both grips facilitate flipping between the point and the knuckle being exposed while the sai is held in strong grip positions. Because there is no morphological plural in Japanese, the word \\"sai\\" refers to either a single weapon or multiple. Nicho sai refers to a kata that uses two sai, while sancho sai kata refers to kata using three sai.

It resulted from the 1968 merger of historically black colleges and other schools established by northern Protestant missions during and after the American Civil War. History LeMoyne Normal and Commercial School was founded in 1862, when the American Missionary Association (AMA) sent Lucinda Humphrey to open an elementary school at Camp Shiloh (Tennessee) for free blacks and escaped slaves. This was one of more than ten schools founded by the AMA, an integrated organization led by black and white Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian ministers. The school was established soon after the occupation of Memphis by Federal troops during the Civil War; they were based at Camp Shiloh outside the city limits to the south. First known as Lincoln Chapel, the school relocated into Memphis proper in 1863 from south of the city. In 1866 it was destroyed during white race riots that broke out following the withdrawal of federal troops. Francis Julius LeMoyne ca 1860 The school was rebuilt, and in 1867 it reopened with 150 students and six teachers. In 1870, Francis Julius LeMoyne (1798-1879), a Washington, Pennsylvania doctor, donated $20,000 to the American Missionary Association to build an elementary and secondary school for prospective teachers. LeMoyne, who was a notable abolitionist, traveled from his Pennsylvania home to visit the new school. He donated a clock for the school's tower. In 1871, the school opened in a new building at 284 Orleans Street and was named LeMoyne Normal and Commercial School. The Memphis yellow fever epidemic started in 1873 and took a toll on many school personnel. Under the leadership of the third principal, Andrew J. Steele, the school enjoyed three decades of growth and development. In 1914 the school moved from Orleans Street to its present site on Walker Avenue. Steele Hall, the first building on the new campus, was erected that same year. LeMoyne became a junior college in 1924. After developing a four-year curriculum, it became a four-year college in 1930. The LeMoyne College was chartered by the State of Tennessee four years later. Steele Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and the core of the college's campus was listed on the National Register in 2005. Owen College was established as a junior college in 1947, when the Tennessee Baptist Missionary and Educational Convention bought property for that purpose on Vance Avenue. After they developed the facility, S. A. Owen Junior College opened at that location in 1954. LeMoyne‚ÄìOwen College was formed through the 1968 merger of LeMoyne College and Owen College, both private, historically black, church-affiliated colleges.LeMoyne- Owen College Welcome, History In 2007, LeMoyne-Owen suffered from management and accreditation issues due to a lack of financial resources. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed the college on probation for two years. In August 2007, the City of Memphis ensured the college would open for the fall 2007 semester by pledging $3 million in taxpayer funds to be added to other substantial pledges from the United Negro College Fund, Cummins, radio host Tom Joyner and the United Church of Christ. The donation pledge, approved by the City Council, aroused controversy. City councilmembers defended their actions as contributing to the city and its residents. The college's president Johnnie B. Watson said that the college has reaffirmed its accreditation. It had increased its endowment to 20 million dollars in 2014. In July 2020, LeMoyne-Ownen College received the largest donation in its history. A $40 million donation from the Community Foundation of Greater Memphis quadrupled the college's endowment. LeMoyne-Ownen's president called the gift \\"transformative\\" for all that the college does and can do. The Community Foundation will give approximately $2 million annually. https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/education/2020/07/02/lemoyne-owen- college-receives-40-million-endowment-community-foundation/5363525002/ Historic district The LeMoyne College Historic District is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. It includes four contributing buildings and the 1936 campus quadrangle as a contributing site. It is roughly bounded by Walker, Hollis Price, Crown and alley to rear of Sweeney Hall. It includes Steel Hall, built in 1914, the oldest and original building on this campus, which was designed by Tandy & Foster and is separately listed on the National Register. With It includes two Colonial Revival buildings, Brownlee and Sweeney halls, which were designed by George Awsumb along with the quadrangle in 1936. Sweeney Hall is named for Frank J.

At the southern end of Lake WƒÅnaka, it is at the start of the Clutha River and is the gateway to Mount Aspiring National Park. Wanaka is primarily a resort town with both summer and winter seasons. Its economy is based on the many outdoor opportunities this offers. Historically, MƒÅori visited the Wanaka area to hunt and fish in summer, or on their way to seek pounamu (greenstone) on the West Coast. NgƒÅi Tahu abandoned their seasonal camps after a raid by a North Island war party in 1836. The current town was founded during the gold rush of the 19th century. Along with the rest of the Queenstown-Lakes District, Wanaka is growing rapidly, with the population increasing by 50% between 2005 and 2015. History Wanaka was visited annually by NgƒÅi Tahu who sought greenstone in the mountains above the Haast River and hunted eels and birds over summer, returning to the east coast by descending the Clutha River / Mata-Au in reed boats called m≈çkihi. NgƒÅi Tahu use of the land was ended by attacks by North Island tribes. In 1836, the NgƒÅti Tama chief Te Puoho led a 100-person war party, armed with muskets, down the West Coast and over the Haast Pass: they fell on the NgƒÅi Tahu encampment between Lake WƒÅnaka and Lake HƒÅwea, capturing 10 people and killing and eating two children. Some of the NgƒÅi Tahu fled down the Waitaki river to the coast; Te Puoho took his captives over the Crown Range to Lake Wakatipu and thence to Southland where he was killed and his war party destroyed by the southern NgƒÅi Tahu leader Tuhawaiki. The first European to visit the area was Nathaniel Chalmers, who was guided inland by Chiefs Reko and Kaikoura in 1853. Reko and Kaikoura showed Chalmers the rock bridge \\"Whatatorere\\" at Roaring Meg, which was the only place that the Kawarau River could be jumped over, and returned him down the Clutha in a m≈çkihi reed boat. European settlement began in the Upper Clutha River Valley in the 1850s, with the establishment of sheep stations by runholders. The first station was at Albert Town, the only place where settlers could ford the Clutha River. The present site of Wanaka was first surveyed in 1863. Settlement increased in Pembroke during the 1870s because of timber milling in the Matukituki Valley that used Lake WƒÅnaka for transport. Tourism began in 1867 when Theodore Russell opened the first hotel, and with the world's first sheepdog trials. The town of Pembroke was renamed Wanaka in 1940. Wanaka proved a very popular tourist destination because of its borderline continental climate and easy access to snow and water. Geography Wanaka cafe strip on a quiet clear spring dayThe town of Wanaka is situated at the southern end of Lake WƒÅnaka, surrounded by mountains. To the southwest is the Crown Range and town of Queenstown (); to the north the Haast Pass cuts through the Southern Alps near Makarora. To the northeast are the towns of Omarama and Twizel. Very close to Lake WƒÅnaka is Lake HƒÅwea, in a parallel glacial valley, which has a recently developed settlement of about 1,500 people. To the south of the town lies more of the Southern Alps. The Glendhu Bay motorpark is close to the town, leading into the Matukituki River valley which gives access to the Mount Aspiring National Park. The centre of the town lies on flat land beside Roy's Bay. Parts of the town have expanded into the hills surrounding the centre and around Roy's Bay in both directions. The lakeside area of the town is prone to occasional flooding in spring, when heavy rain and snowmelt can cause the lake to rise quickly, as in November 1999. Climate Despite New Zealand's mostly oceanic climate, Wanaka is one of the few areas in the country to enjoy a semi-continental climate, with four distinct seasons. The weather is fairly dry, with spring (September‚ÄìDecember) being the wettest season. Annual rainfall is 682 mm which is half the national average. Wanaka's summers are warm, with temperatures reaching the high 20s and an average summer maximum of . Wanaka's highest-ever temperature of was recorded in January 2018. Winter can be extreme by New Zealand standards with temperature mostly in the single digits during the day time followed by cold and frosty nights and frequent snowfalls. Demography Wanaka is home to people as of It is the country's 43rd-largest urban area and the fifth-largest urban area in Otago behind Dunedin, Queenstown, Mosgiel and Oamaru.

As with other parts of the wine region, the main grape variety in the area is pinot noir. Attractions View of Wanaka from Mt Roy. With its lake and mountain views, Wanaka has become a popular tourist resort, considered less commercialised than Queenstown. Wanaka boasts a growing number of restaurants, cafes and a diverse nightlife. Other attractions in the town include Puzzling World and the Paradiso Cinema. Puzzling World contains a maze, optical illusions and a leaning clocktower. The Paradiso is a classic old cinema, with seating consisting of old couches and an in-theatre Morris Minor. There are several wineries in the area. Just out of town next to the Wanaka Airport is the National Transport and Toy Museum. In winter, Wanaka is an excellent place to see the Southern Lights. A number of mountains surrounding Wanaka can be climbed, including Roys Peak, Mount Iron, Mount Grand and the Pisa Range, all of which provide views of the surrounding area. \\"That Wanaka Tree\\" - a willow growing just inside the lake - is a tourist attraction in its own right, featuring on many tourists' Instagram feeds. The tree had its lower branches cut by vandals in 2020. Festivals Aerial panorama of the town *The biennial Warbirds over Wanaka airshow has become a major attraction for national and international guests. *Wanakafest *NZ Freeski open *The biennial New Zealand music Rippon Festival *Challenge Wanaka Triathlon Festival *Festival of Colour and Aspiring Conversations. Two festivals organised by the Southern Lakes Arts Festival Trust. The Festival of Colour is a biennial multi disciplinary arts festival featuring theatre, music, dance and visual arts. Aspiring Conversations is an ideas festival. Both are timed for April in alternate years. * Rhythm and Alps Film locations The Wanaka region has been the setting for many international films, including The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, the Legend of S, and A Wrinkle in Time. Summer That Wanaka Tree in summer Wanaka is host to outdoor recreation and tourism activities with hiking, mountain biking, mountaineering, rock climbing, fishing, paragliding, kayaking, rafting, jetboating, and environmental activities. Wanaka has a sunny climate and serves as an access point to the highest New Zealand mountain outside of the Mount Cook region: Mount Aspiring/Tititea. Mount Aspiring National Park is popular for mountaineering and hiking. Tourists enjoy day trips into the park and many tourists go hiking in the park for up to a week at a time. Parts of the Matukituki Valley on the road to the park are popular for rock climbing, and for day walks. Lake Wanaka itself is popular for waterskiing, wakeboarding and sailing. This along with the local rivers provide many opportunities for fishing. There is a dedicated mountain biking area made by volunteers in a local pine forest. Adjacent to the bike park is an 18-hole disc golf course. All the local ski resorts are open for mountain biking and hiking in the summer. That Wanaka Tree close to winter Winter Tramping to the summit of Treble ConeWanaka has the broadest range of snow activity choices of any town in NZ. These include Treble Cone, Cardrona Alpine Resort and Snow Farm, some of New Zealand's premier commercial ski fields. Wanaka is the main accommodation provider for these resorts and so is very busy in high season (July‚ÄìSeptember). Winter in Wanaka is also the home to a variety of winter sporting events including everything from the annual free Winter Games to The Merino Muster. Treble Cone has good lift-accessed terrain and for this reason has become popular amongst visitors, 'ConeHeads'. It also catches some of the better snow in the area, with its location and orientation getting more snow from NW storms. Cardrona is more attractive to families and beginners, though an attempt has been made at the park riding population in competition with SnowPark. Snowpark is a dedicated 100% artificial terrain park for advanced riders. Snow Farm is New Zealand's only commercial cross-country ski field. Cardrona also hosts one of the few Olympic sized halfpipes in the world and has been used for practice for Olympic competition. Government Nationally, Wanaka is part of the Waitaki electorate, represented by the New Zealand National Party's Jacqui Dean since 2005. Wanaka's local governments are the Queenstown-Lakes District Council and the Otago Regional Council. Education Wanaka has four schools. *Holy Family School is a state- integrated Catholic full primary (Year 1‚Äì8) school, and has students as of The school was established in 2006. *Mount Aspiring College is a state Year 7‚Äì13 secondary school, and has students as of The school was established in 1986 following the split of Wanaka Area School. *Wanaka Primary School is a state contributing primary (Year 1‚Äì6) school, and has students as of The school was established in 1986 following the split of Wanaka Area School, and relocated to its current site in October 2010. *Te Kura O Take KƒÅrara is a state contributing primary school, and has 80 students as of March 2020. The schools was established in 2020, providing capacity for more primary school aged children as Wanaka's population grows. Transport Wanaka is served by the Wanaka Airport as well as by roads over the Crown Range, through the Haast Pass to the West Coast, to Mount Cook Village via the Lindis Pass to the north, and south through Cromwell by . There are daily bus services to Christchurch, Dunedin, Queenstown, Invercargill and Greymouth. During the early 20th century an unsuccessful proposal was made for the Otago Central Railway, then terminated at Cromwell, to be extended to Wanaka and onward to Lake HƒÅwea.Over the Garden Wall : The Story of the Otago Central Railway, James Albert Dangerfield, George West Emerson; New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society (Otago Branch), 1967 The main reason for NZR's reluctance was having to cross the Clutha River twice. A more direct route to HƒÅwea was planned but dropped due to cost.

Located on the site of what was the Bird's Custard factory in Digbeth, it is home to a variety of creative and digital businesses, independent shops and cafes and bars. They include hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses and some larger ones such as ASOS.com. The project was set up by Bennie Gray in 1992 and substantially expanded by his son Lucan Gray, who owned and ran the project until June 2017. From 1968 until May 1972 the premises was occupied by Hawkins Paper and Plastics Ltd. Later, the company moved the operation to its site in Leominster, Herefordshire, where the plastic film was made. Development The Custard Factory complex is set in fifteen acres (60,000 m¬≤) of factory buildings, originally constructed by Sir Alfred Frederick Bird (1849‚Äì1922), the son of Alfred Bird (1811‚Äì1878), the inventor of egg-free custard. The architectural firm commissioned to design the building was Hamblins. The architect may have been Augustus William Brenchley Macer-Wright who married Ellen Kate Hamblin, known as Jenny, who was the daughter of the man behind the architect firm's name. There is no positive evidence in Birmingham City Archive. At one time, a thousand people worked there. After the Bird company's departure to Banbury in 1964, the buildings were redeveloped from 1992, in two initial phases. The architect for the redevelopment project was Birmingham-based Glenn Howells Architects. The redevelopment of the Custard Factory began in January 1992 when the project was given ¬£800,000 as a City Grant Award. This public sector funding levered in ¬£1.6 million of private sector investment for the refurbishment of of redundant buildings, providing 145 units for use by artists, designers and communicators. The first phase created around 300 jobs, half of which were previously unemployed. By the completion of the Custard Factory project, it is anticipated that a total of 1,000 jobs will be created. Phase one consisted of the refurbishment of Scott House which is now home to a community of hundreds of media companies, artists and small creative enterprises. The loading bay was turned into a lake around which the developers installed around 200 studio workshops above the ground floor - plus on the ground floor a caf√©, meeting rooms, dance studios, holistic therapy rooms, art display cases in the foyer and a larger gallery space called \\"The Gallery\\" at the rear, a record and clothes shop, sculpture (a huge iron dragon crawls up the exterior of the Medicine Bar), and fountains within a central pool area which is sometimes emptied to allow for dance music events. The Medicine Bar and Kitchen have provided a stage for many musicians, DJs and rappers. A 220-seat theatre was also provided, inspired by the Custard Factory Theatrical Company who first asked for space at the Custard Factory before the project commenced. Phase two - originally named 'The Greenhouse', but now 'Gibb Square' after the Gibb Street location - was completed opposite the Custard Factory in 2002. It focuses on new media and media businesses. It includes a hundred studio/offices, a ring of poolside shops, galleries and restaurants plus the Green Man, a high sculpture by Tawny Gray - a huge structure made from vegetation and stone, standing next to a large water feature and overlooking the alleyway that divides the Custard Factory from the Gibb Square development. Zellig In March 2007, the regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands, announced new funding for the Custard Factory of ¬£9.6m, to open 100 new office and workspace units. The result was Zellig (former Devonshire House), a restored grade II listed building, featuring a new sculpture, the Deluge, by sculptress Toin Adams and opened in May 2010. Co-located media training The presence of the Custard Factory has enticed two media training agencies to locate nearby. The old Trades Union Studies Centre, very near, is now a media and arts annexe of South Birmingham College with a new building alongside it. In 2005, the VIVID media centre moved from the Jewellery Quarter to a site very near the Custard Factory. About away from the Factory is the new \\"Progress Works\\" complex, opened in 2005 as part of the Custard Factory quarter, on Heath Mill Lane. \\"The Bond\\" complex is also a short walk away. Three-quarters of a mile north is BIAD, the largest British university art & design teaching and research centre outside London. Nearby entertainment and shopping locations Many different events take place at the Custard Factory, from music nights to theatre, poetry readings and storytelling. Located nearby are two renowned music venues, The Institute (formerly The Sanctuary) and AIR, home to and owned by Godskitchen the trance superclub. The Custard Factory is close to the Old Crown pub, a half-timbered building dating from the 14th century, Birmingham Coach Station, and the Bull Ring which is Birmingham's main shopping centre, with its landmark Selfridges building. The Custard Factory itself boasts its own retail section home to many independent stores.

Cajones are primarily played in Afro-Peruvian music (specifically m√∫sica criolla), but has made its way into flamenco as well. The term caj√≥n is also applied to other box drums used in Latin American music, such as the Cuban caj√≥n de rumba and the Mexican caj√≥n de tapeo. Description Sheets of 13 to 19 mm (1/2 to 3/4 inch) thick wood are generally used for five sides of the box. A thinner sheet of plywood is nailed on as the sixth side, and acts as the striking surface or head. The striking surface of the caj√≥n drum is commonly referred to as the tapa. A sound hole is cut on the back side. The modern caj√≥n may have rubber feet, and has several screws at the top for adjusting percussive timbre. Originally the instruments were only wooden boxes, but now they may have several stretched cords pressed against the top for a buzz-like effect, resembling a snare drum‚Äîguitar strings, rattles or drum snares may serve this purpose. Bells may also be installed inside near the cords.  Origins and evolution  Street musician Heidi Joubert playing a decorated caj√≥n in London, England The caj√≥n is the most widely used Afro- Peruvian musical instrument since the late 16th century.Tompkins, William David: \\"Afro-Peruvian Traditions\\" in \\"Music of the African Diaspora in the Americas,\\" p. 493. Springer US Press, 2005 Slaves of west and central African origin in the Americas are considered to be the source of the caj√≥n drum. Currently, the instrument is common in musical performance throughout some of the Americas and Spain. The caj√≥n was developed during the periods of slavery in coastal Peru. The instrument reached a peak in popularity by 1850, and by the end of the 19th century caj√≥n players were experimenting with the design of the instrument by bending some of the planks in the caj√≥n's body to alter the instrument's patterns of sound vibration. After slavery the caj√≥n was spread to a much larger audience including Criollos. Given that the caj√≥n comes from slave musicians in the Spanish colonial Americas, there are two complementary origin theories for the instrument. It is possible that the drum is a direct descendant of a number of boxlike musical instruments from west and central Africa, especially Angola, and the Antilles. These instruments were adapted by slaves from the Spanish shipping crates at their disposal. In port cities like Matanzas, Cuba, codfish shipping crates and small dresser drawers became similar instruments. Peruvian musician and ethnomusicologist Susana Baca recounts her mother's story that the caj√≥n originated as \\"the box of the people who carried fruit and worked in the ports,\\" putting it down to play on whenever they had a moment. Another theory is that slaves used boxes as musical instruments to subvert Spanish colonial bans on music in predominantly African areas, essentially disguising their instruments. While early 20th century versions of the festejo appeared to have been performed without the caj√≥n, especially due to the influence of Per√∫ Negro, a musical ensemble founded in 1969, the caj√≥n began to be more important than the guitar and, indeed, became \\"a new symbol of Peruvian blackness\\".Feldman p. 160. After a short 1980 visit and TV presentation in Lima along with Peruvian percussionist Caitro Soto, Spanish flamenco guitar player Paco de Luc√≠a brought a caj√≥n to Spain to use it in his own music, after being impressed by the rhythmic possibilities of the instrument. In 2001, the caj√≥n was declared National Heritage by the Peruvian National Institute of Culture. In 2014, the Organization of American States declared the caj√≥n an \\"Instrument of Peru for the Americas\\".  Contemporary music  Example percussion setup, with caj√≥n replacing the bass drum In the 2000s (decade), the caj√≥n is heard extensively in Coastal Peruvian musical stylesFeldman, Heidi: \\"Black Rhythms of Peru\\". Wesleyan University Press, 2006 such as Tondero, Zamacueca and Peruvian Waltz, Spanish modern Flamenco and certain styles of modern Cuban Rumba. The modern caj√≥n is often used to accompany a solo acoustic guitar or piano. The caj√≥n is becoming rapidly popular in blues, pop, rock, funk, world music, jazz, etc. The caj√≥n is often used as a bass drum by bands instead of a full drum kit when performing in minimalist settings, as the caj√≥n can simultaneously serve as both a bass drum and a seat for the drummer. Though occasionally played by some bands in place of the ', the caj√≥n has not become a popular instrument in the folk music of Ireland, where the quieter and higher-pitched ' traditional frame drum serves the same purpose, and has a unique playing style. The caj√≥n also features in some Breton music. Playing styles  The player sits astride the box, tilting it at an angle while striking the head between their knees. The percussionist can play the sides with the top of their palms and fingers for additional sounds. Some percussionists attach a bass drum pedal to the instrument, enabling them to play it with a single foot. The instrument has been played not only with hands, but also with plastic and metal brushes, as used for drum kits. Another way of playing the caj√≥n is to use an ordinary bass drum pedal, thus turning the caj√≥n into an indirect percussion instrument which can be played with the feet. This enables the player to beat it just like a pedal-bass drum, thus leaving the hands (and one other foot) free to play other instruments. On the other hand, it also restricts the player's standard caj√≥n-playing position, as when the caj√≥n is placed on the ground, in the bass drum location, it is hard for the performer to slap it with her or his hands.

The 'new' United was formed in 2011 (resurrecting a name used by the town's football club around the advent of the twentieth century). Between 1930 and 2010 the town was represented by Ashford Town FC, before it ultimately went into administration. The current club is therefore a 'phoenix club', rising from the ashes of financial ruin of its predecessor and although not a supporter owned club continues, like most non-league clubs, through the contributions of volunteers and supporters. Ashford United are currently members of the following their record-breaking promotion from the Southern Counties East Football League in the 2016/17 season. United are also one of very few semi-professional teams in England to have a synthetic 3G pitch, located at their home 'The Homelands'. History See List of Ashford United F.C. seasons for League and Cup records. Formation and early years (1881‚Äì1939) The roots of senior football in Ashford originate in 1881 with the South Eastern Rangers who played at Newtown Green (with dressing rooms in the adjacent Alfred Arms). The club reached the Final of the Kent County Badge competition (the fore-runner of the Kent Senior Cup) in 1886 and 1888 but lost on both occasions to Chatham. In 1891 the original Ashford United was formed when the South Eastern Rangers amalgamated with Kentish Express FC. Initially their home ground was at the back of the Victoria Hotel. About 700 people yielding gate receipts of ¬£5 were present for 'United's' first match on 19 September 1891, a defeat by the Highland Light Infantry 1‚Äì5. Two weeks later the club played their first FA Cup match, an away first round qualifying tie in which they were defeated 6‚Äì2 at Crouch End. In 1893 the team exceeded the exploits of their fore-runners and defeated Chatham in winning the Kent Senior Cup. Ashford had been the beneficiaries of a bye prior to the final ‚Äì in the semi-final they were due to meet the West Kent Regiment but the West Kent's were shipped out to Ireland before the match took place. Scorers for United in the 2‚Äì0 win were Archie Munro and Frank Young. A few months afterwards, in October 1893, in an 1893‚Äì94 FA Cup first round qualifying match Ashford United suffered their record defeat: a 12‚Äì0 loss to Woolwich Arsenal (and an all-time equaling biggest goal difference win by Arsenal). The tie was not without controversy as before the match it was reported in the Kentish Independent Newspaper that Arsenal, as a team playing at a higher level (they had that season joined the Football League Second Division), expected a one-sided victory and had openly offered Ashford ¬£20 and the promise of a friendly match against their second team in Ashford if they would scratch from the tie: the offer was not accepted. The club were founder members of the Kent League in 1894‚Äì95 with a reserve side playing in Kent League 2. The club relocated to an enclosed ground with a timber built stand at Godinton Road where the 1899 KCFA Cup Final was staged. Team colours at the time were black and white striped shirts. In early 1900 two Ashford players, Gilbert Godsmark and George Foley were transferred to Second Division club Newton Heath. The former of these players is notable as the first signed for a transfer fee by the club that was shortly to become Manchester United. The fee of ¬£40 was payable in two instalments with half paid immediately and the remainder after satisfactory completion of a trial period. However, after scoring four goals in nine matches sadly, early the following year, Godsmark died of disease on army service at the Second Boer War ‚Äì with Ashford reportedly serving a writ for the remaining ¬£20. The team appeared again in the Kent Senior Cup Final in two successive years, but were unsuccessful on both occasions. Season 1901‚Äì02 saw them lose a replay 1‚Äì4 to Sittingbourne (played at Ramsgate), following a 2‚Äì2 draw (played at Faversham) when a last minute penalty equaliser for Sittingbourne caused the replay. Then the following season (1902‚Äì03) they were defeated by Maidstone 1‚Äì2, with the final being played again at Faversham. During the early 1900s in addition to playing in The Kent League the club competed in the Thames & Medway Combination. In the 1903‚Äì04 FA Cup the team achieved a then club best in reaching the 4th round qualifying where they were defeated at home 0‚Äì2 by old rivals Chatham Town. In 1907 owing to a lack of support at their Godinton Road ground (which being beyond the railway bridge was a fair distance from the town and their previous base in the Newtown area), the club suffering from heavy debts was unable to fulfill its fixtures and ceased playing mid-season. Shortly afterwards however a new club, Ashford Railway Works, was formed\\" through the instrumentality of Mr Walter Hole and others\\". The club's home ground was relocated back to Newtown on land believed to have been provided rent-free by the South Eastern & Chatham Railway. Playing in red and green quartered colours the team enjoyed considerable success. In 1909‚Äì10 they won the Folkestone and District Senior League and were also runners-up in Kent League Division 2: Eastern section. The railwaymen went on to win the latter league in four successive seasons, 1911‚Äì12, 1912‚Äì13, 1913‚Äì14 and 1919‚Äì20 (the latter after the break caused by the Great War). In both the 1912‚Äì13 and 1913‚Äì14 seasons the Railway Works team had finished tied on points with Folkestone Gas and Folkestone respectively but took the Championship by winning a deciding play-off match on each occasion. It was around this time that the club acquired its nickname of the ‚ÄòNuts and Bolts‚Äô as many of the members were drawn from the ranks of skilled engineers in the railway. The club became more commonly known as 'Ashford' upon the post-war resumption of the Kent League competition. However, once more fate took a hand and in 1928 the club folded leaving the Town with no senior club. The decision to found Ashford Town was taken at a meeting in April 1930 chaired by Sir Charles Iggledon, who was the editor of the Kentish Express. Ashford Town were elected to the Kent League, and played their first match on 30 August of the same year at the railway works ground with Canterbury Waverley the visitors. The result was a 4‚Äì2 victory. In 1931 the club moved to Essella Park. Initially the ground was provided rent-free by Fred Norman. He was co-founder and co-owner of Norman Cycles and would go on to become Club President post second war. The rent-free arrangement remained in place until the 1950s at which time the club purchased the freehold for¬£2,060 and 7s ‚Äì reputedly the sum Norman had paid for the land many years earlier. The Essella park pitch featured a notable slope with the goal at the Willesborough end being considerably higher than that at the Ashford end. In 1931‚Äì32, the first season playing at their new ground, the Town were runners- up in the Kent League scoring an all-time club record 115 goals over the 36 match season. They were headed by Northfleet United who at the time were a nursery teamKent's nursery clubs Retrieved 16 April 2014 for Football League Division 2 team Tottenham Hotspur. Former Crystal Palace and Sheffield United forward Bert Menlove was player-manager of the Town in the early 1930s. The most high-profile game played at Essella Park in the early years was in 1934‚Äì35 with an FA Cup First Round Proper tie with Clapton (now Leyton) Orient of the Football League Third Division South. Town had won away at Kent League powerhouse team Northfleet United in the final qualifying round to reach this stage of the competition. The tie with Orient had extra spice as Ashford were in effect a nursery team for Orient who had loaned a couple of young players and had transferred several players to the 'Nuts and Bolts' ‚Äì the most notably being former Liverpool and England full back Tommy Lucas who had been appointed by Orient as manager. In a match that \\"lacked nothing in vigour and spirit\\" in front of 3,000 spectators Ashford fell 4‚Äì1 to their visitors. Another notable player appearing for the Town around this time was record Tottenham Hotspur hotshot (and scorer of the only goal in the 1921 FA Cup final) Jimmy Dimmock. At this time former Margate player Harry Todd was player-coach of the team. The final home game played by the club in 1939 before suspension of Kent League matches owing to the second world war saw the 'Town' triumph over Bexley Heath to win the Kent League Cup. Post-War: Kent League (1946‚Äì1959) After the war the club re-formed in 1946 and with Joe Fagg as team manager and former West Ham United defender Charlie Walker as player-coach were Kent League champions in 1948‚Äì49. This success was by 'goal average' as three clubs (Ashford, Dover and Ramsgate) all finished the campaign with 52 points from 34 matches. In recognition of the achievement the club presented an engraved fountain pen to each player. The team scored 109 goals in their league campaign (second highest ever to the 115 scored in the 1931‚Äì32 season). It was almost a double celebration as the reserve side missed out on top spot in the Kent League Division 2 with Folkestone's reserves taking the honours. The Ashford second string were however subsequently successful, taking the Kent League Division 2 title in the 1952‚Äì53 and 1955‚Äì56 campaigns. Walker was succeeded in 1951 as player-coach by another ex-Margate man, Ken Horrigan. Other player-coaches from this era were David Nelson and Harry Freeman. In 1958 a significant appointment for Ashford Town was that of ex-Leyton Orient and Southampton full-back Ted Ballard as manager. In his four years at the club would guide the 'nuts and bolts' to notable cup success. In the 1958‚Äì59 season the club (and for a second time a club representing Ashford) won the Kent Senior Cup. Kent League Ashford beat Southern League Tonbridge in the final at Gillingham. Ron Vigar scored both goals in a 2‚Äì1 victory with Tonbridge hitting the post from a penalty. Also in 1958‚Äì59 whilst still playing in the Kent League the team reached the FA Cup First Round proper where they lost 1‚Äì0 to Football League opposition, Crystal Palace, in front of an Essella Park ground record of 6,525 spectators. This match was refereed by a youthful Jack Taylor who climaxed his career as referee at the 1974 World Cup Final. This season was the first of four consecutive appearances by Ashford (who remained managed by Ted Ballard throughout this time) in the FA Cup first round proper. For each of these years they would ultimately fall to teams from the Football League. The Southern League Division 1 (1959‚Äì1971) The league competition in which the club played, the Kent League (which had been in existence since 1894), was disbanded in 1959. Together with seven refugees from this League (Folkestone, Ramsgate, Margate, Dover, Bexleyleath and Welling, Tunbridge Wells and Sittingbourne) the club joined the Southern League. Ashford's 44-year membership of the Southern League commenced in the 1959‚Äì60 season as members of the newly formed Division One (the second level of the Southern League) ‚Äì the league included the rumps of the previous South East and North West Divisions together with two additional new recruits, Hinckley Athletic and Romford. Away matches for the team involved more extensive travelling with trips to amongst others Exeter City Reserves, Merthyr Tydfil, Kidderminster, Burton Albion and Cambridge City to be negotiated. The 'Town's' first match in the new league was 22 August 1959 and was an 8‚Äì1 reverse at fellow newcomers Hinckley Athletic. Four days later playing the other newly recruited club Romford in front of a 2,800 crowd at Essella Park Ashford notched their first points courtesy of a 1‚Äì0 victory (scorer: Murfet). The season also witnessed the team's second successive appearance in the First round proper of the FA Cup: the result a defeat 5‚Äì0 at League club Brentford in front of a crowd of 13,900 ‚Äì the largest single match crowd to see the 'Town' play. In making this round of the cup once again Ashford Town were awarded full membership of The Football Association, an honour much cherished by the club. But 1959 was not all about action on the pitch. In this year the club became a Limited Company. But a more visible milestone was appearance of floodlighting at the Essella Road ground. The installation of the 'Do it Yourself' floodlighting was perhaps the best example of voluntary effort at the club. The self designed and installed system comprised eight 40-foot high towers each housing four 2,000 watt lamps. The total output was thus 64 kilowatts and had required an up-rated power supply to be laid to the ground. The overall cost was ¬£1,507.10s.5d. It is reported that only once in their 28-year lifetime did the power fail. The lights were officially switched on with a Grand Opening Floodlight Game on Monday 19 October 1959 with First Division Chelsea the visitors. England forward and football legend Jimmy Greaves scored four goals in a 7‚Äì2 victory for the Londoners, with Ron Vigar and Gordon Burden netting for the home side. The 1960‚Äì61 campaign saw the club's FA Cup exploits curtailed once again in the First Round proper with a 1‚Äì2 home loss (Town scorer: Joe White) to League club Gillingham. On the Gills teamsheet was forward John Shepherd who played for and skippered Ashford the following season. The cup run in that 1961‚Äì62 season was the next high-point in Ashford Town's history when the club reached the FA Cup 2nd round proper. After beating (then non-league) Wycombe Wanderers 3‚Äì0 (scorers Joe White, Ron Clayton & John Shepherd) in a First Round replay at Essella Park, the club lost 0‚Äì3 on home turf to Queens Park Rangers ‚Äì playing for the visitors was Keith Rutter who would subsequently return to Ashford three years later to captain the team. On the minor cups front in 1961‚Äì62 the club won the Kent Floodlight Trophy, beating Tonbridge 2‚Äì1 in a second replay, but were losers 1‚Äì4 to Dover in the Kent Senior Cup final. In the latter competition after an aggregate draw over two ties the decider for the Senior Cup 1961‚Äì62 winner was unusually played at the start of the 1962‚Äì63 season (in front of a little over four thousand spectators on neutral territory at Folkestone). The team put this setback behind them and later that same season lifted the Kent Senior Cup for a third time by beating Margate 1‚Äì0 in the 1962‚Äì63 final played at Gillingham with former England Youth player Brian Dellar notching the decider. In February 1964 the team recorded their record Southern League victory, beating Barry 10‚Äì1 with John Harris, Laurie Thompson, Bob Walker(2), Malcolm Collins, Paul Nicholas(3), Alec Garden and John Smith scoring the goals. A further upshot of the disbanding of the Kent League was that the Reserve team had to find another League too. In 1959‚Äì60 they were founder members of the Seanglian League (in effect a reserves section of the Aetolian League which itself consisted mostly of disenfranchised former Kent League clubs). The second string team were winners of the 12 team Seanglian League in 1961‚Äì62. Two years later in 1963‚Äì64 this league morphed into the Metropolitan & District League. In 1966‚Äì67 the Kent League reformed and the Reserves joined-up. Although the club had for many years played in green and white, for a while in the sixties they adopted tangerine and white for their team colours. By the end of the decade they reverted to their 'traditional' green and white. In 1965 the club appointed ex-England and Chelsea full back and First Division championship medal holder Peter Sillett as player-manager, replacing the previous incumbent Bert Sibley. In season 1966‚Äì67 by beating Cambridge City 4‚Äì1 (2 goals each from Tim Soutar & Jim Roberts) in the first round the club once again advanced to the 2nd Round proper of the FA Cup, with a visit to Third Division Swindon Town the prize. The initial tie on the Saturday was postponed owing to frozen pitch at the County Ground. The re-arranged fixture provided no respite however with Ashford falling 5‚Äì0 to Swindon. It wasn't until the end of the sixties though that elusive League success was achieved. Throughout its Southern League tenure Ashford had been a mid/lower table team. Their previous high point was 7th in 1963‚Äì64. But this was eclipsed by a fourth-placed finish under the managership of Peter Sillett in 1969‚Äì70 ‚Äì a position that was rewarded with promotion to the Southern League Premier Division. This was a big step up for the club and represents their highest placing in the football pyramid. They were only one division below the Football League ‚Äì indeed the 1969‚Äì70 Southern Premier champions, Cambridge United, had been elected to the Football League (there being no automatic promotion at this time). Ashfords first match in the 1970‚Äì71 Premier was a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Weymouth with Ashford equalising through Terry Street with the very last kick of the match. Two days later Ashford (extremely) briefly topped the table courtesy of a 1‚Äì3 win at Margate. But with only eight wins all season the club finished 20th (from 22) and were relegated. Notable performances during the campaign came from the men between the posts: The previous season's keeper David Hills ceased playing early in the season; for several games a temporary replacement, former 1950's Chelsea goalie, Bob Robertson appeared; new custodian Brian Gambrill signed-on for ¬£300 from Canterbury City and conceded seven goals on his home debut (in a 7‚Äì1 loss to Worcester City ‚Äì former Chelsea FA Youth Cup winner David Gillingwater hitting the 'Town's' lone marker); mid-season he became injured and for several matches local amateur 'keeper Reg Gorham stepped in (echoing the make- up of the original Ashford United club he worked for the local free-sheet newspaper). The latter back-stopped the club to a 4‚Äì2 home win against Hillingdon Borough to snap a 14-game winless run. Despite the lacklustre league campaign the team progressed to the Kent Senior Cup semi-final where the lost 4‚Äì3 away to Dover. The Southern League Division 1 South (1971‚Äì1979) The demotion from the Southern Premier put Ashford in the now regionalised Southern League Division One South for 1971‚Äì72 where the 'nuts and bolts' recorded a tenth-placed finish. The same season the Reserves reached the final of the Kent League Division One Cup being defeated by Chatham in the final. The following season, 1972‚Äì73, the club had their best ever non-league knock-out cup run when they reached the semi-final of the FA Trophy ‚Äì just one match from a Wembley final. Alas the dream was not to be: in a match played on neutral turf at Peterborough they lost 1‚Äì0 to a disputed second half penalty to Northern Premier League Scarborough (who would themselves go on to win the trophy). Ironically for a club so linked to the railways, supporters travelling on a special train arrived 15 minutes after the kick-off following a delay en route. On the League front Ashford finished third in the 1972‚Äì73 Southern League Division One South, one place below the promotion places. Alan Morton set a club record scoring 46 goals in 69 games, which stood for 42 years until broken in the 2014‚Äì15 season. There are two other notable events from the 1972‚Äì73 the season. Firstly Roy Hodgson, who has since risen to be amongst Europe's foremost managers, including the England team manager for four years, played for the Town. Secondly the club took part in European football in the appropriately named Cross Channel Competition. Teams from French towns near the coast (Boulogne, St Omer and Hazebrouck) played similarly positioned English clubs (Ashford, Folkestone and Dover). Despite the 'Nuts and Bolts' fulfilling a couple of away fixtures the competition fizzled out owing to bad weather and power blackouts (caused by industrial disputes in the UK) leading to fixture congestion. Around the early seventies the club began looking for a new ground. They favoured relocation to a site adjacent to the local authorities leisure complex close to the town centre. But nothing was agreed and the search for new premises wasn't resolved until towards the end of the next decade. Player-wise, goalkeeper Tony Godden signed in 1972. He was later transferred in 1975 (for a very modest ¬£1,500) to the talented West Bromwich Albion team who would, with him playing his part, come close to lifting the Football League League Winners Trophy in 1979. During the 1973‚Äì74 season long-time manager Peter Sillett moved to Folkestone and was replaced by Dennis Hunt who moved in the opposite direction. Dennis had been a member of the Gillingham team that defeated Ashford in the FA cup in 1960‚Äì61. He brought with him Trevor Pearce who five years earlier had been plucked form non-league football by Arsenal. A modicum of progress was made by the Ashford team in reaching the FA Cup First round proper in 1974‚Äì75 with a home tie against Division 3 outfit Walsall. The originally scheduled Saturday fixture was postponed owing to a waterlogged pitch and moved to mid-week. As Ashford's floodlights were not deemed of the required standard for an evening game the match was played on the following Wednesday afternoon. In front of an enthusiastic crowd that included many schoolboys allowed the afternoon off from their schools Ashford lost to Walsall 1‚Äì3 (Town scorer: John Hold). The club hit the local press for all the wrong reasons early in 1977 with a story that the club was ¬£23,000 in debt and two weeks from bankruptcy. There followed a drastic re-organisation and effort both on and off the field which, over several years, restored financial equilibrium. Unfortunately one of the adjustments was on the playing front. Manager Dennis Hunt left and player Bobby Nash took on the role. He was replaced in April 1978 by Gordon Burden who assumed the player-manager role. Gordon had first played for the club in 1954‚Äì55 and he was in his fourth stint as a 'Town' player. On-field performance suffered as a result of the financial tightening and the team endured a run of lowly finishes. The 1978‚Äì79 season was a particular low point as the Town scored an all-time record low of 28 league goals from a programme of 40 matches. Overall in all competitions the team scored 35 goals in their total of 46 matches. Dave Clay top-scored with 8 goals and Peter McRobert next highest with 7. Over the next twenty years Peter would go on to make a club record 765 appearances for the 'Nuts and Bolts'. Southern League Southern Division (1979‚Äì2004) In 1979‚Äì80 there was a major reorganisation of non- league football with the creation in of the Alliance Premier League (the forerunner to the Football Conference). This took the top clubs from the Southern and Northern Premier Leagues. The Southern League was reorganised into Southern and Midland Divisions (with no Premier Division). Ashford Town were placed in the Southern Division. With the club maintaining its stringent financial policies and with stronger former Southern Premier teams (who hadn't made the cut into the Alliance) making up part of the opposition, lowly league finishes continued for the Town team. There was some light however as the team reached the Kent Senior Cup final for two years in succession in 1980‚Äì81 and 1981‚Äì82. On neither occasion were the boys able to bring home the silverware, losing to Alliance Premier League teams Gravesend & Northfleet and Maidstone United respectively. For the 1982‚Äì83 season the Southern Premier Division was re-introduced with regional-based Southern and Midland leagues below. Ashford Town remained in the Southern Division and although ostensibly staying in the same league this was a slide down the football pyramid ‚Äì now being in the third level below the Football League. Ashford had not played below at least the second level for 23 years. 1983‚Äì84 was a decent season with the club finishing in 8th position, whilst also reaching the fourth qualifying round of the FA Cup, before losing 0‚Äì3 at Barking. Ashford also got to the semi-final of the Courage Eastern Floodlit Cup, eventually losing to Stansted 2‚Äì3 on a penalty shoot-out after the sides had drawn a two legged semi-final 3‚Äì3. This was no disgrace a just a couple of weeks later Stansted lifted the FA Vase with a 3‚Äì2 win over Stamford. A slump to 19th position in 1984‚Äì85 saw the two- year reign of Chris Weller as manager end with the re-appointment of Peter Sillett. The turnaround from 18th position in 1985‚Äì86 to League runners-up and promotion in 1986‚Äì87 was striking. The promotion was founded on a tight defensive unit who conceded only 32 goals ‚Äì the fewest in any season by Ashford Town. Sillett was the first manager to pilot the club to promotion since he initially achieved the feat back in 1969‚Äì70 season. Assisting him in the role of trainer on both occasions was George Sargeant. The former Irish Cup winner had previously played for the Town, joining from Hastings in 1952 and fulfilled the 'man with the magic wet sponge' role since the 1960s and would continue for many more years yet! But the 1986‚Äì87 season wasn't all about promotion. It marked the season when the club would bid farewell to Essella Park as their home after 56 years. The final game on 2 May 1987 was in fact a title decider with Dorchester Town. The 0‚Äì0 result meant the Dorset club pipped Ashford to the League title by one point. As noted previously the club had been looking to relocate away from the ground which was in a residential district and hemmed in by houses. Over 15 years they had looked at 17 sites. The directors had now purchased a plot of land for ¬£80,000 a few miles beyond the immediate boundaries of the town in Kingsnorth. The Directors felt that this was \\"not the ideal site\\" but could find nothing within the Town boundary. The project looked to echo the actions of Ashford United who collapsed in 1907 after they re-located too far from its core supporters. The club anticipated the seventy acre site would be developed over time but at the time of the final fixture at Essella Park they still awaited planning permission for the new 'Homelands' stadium ‚Äì and the Chairman of the Directors was critical of \\"constant delays\\" by an \\"unhelpful\\" Ashford Council. The club were therefore without a home stadium and agreed a ground-share at neighbours and longtime rivals Folkestone for the next two years. Following the 1986‚Äì87 promotion the club moved-up to the Southern Premier League ‚Äì now sponsored by Beazer Homes. Manager Peter Sillett left for Poole Town immediately following the promotion and his assistant Nicky Sparks took up the reins for the following two seasons now playing at Folkestone. The 1989‚Äì90 season saw the team return to Ashford with the opening of the newly built Homelands facility. The stadium boasted a capacity of 3,300 with 500 seated. But it wasn't an auspicious inaugural season ‚Äì the team, managed by former incumbent Chris Weller (Nicky Sparks had joined his former boss Peter Sillett now at Hastings), finished 19th of 22 teams and were relegated back to the Southern Division. The mid to late 1980s saw a run of near misses for the Reserves squad. In the Kent League Reserves Division One they were runners-up for four seasons: 1984‚Äì85 (to Sheppey United); 1987‚Äì88 (to Fisher Athletic); 1988‚Äì89 (to Hythe Town); 1990‚Äì91 (to Canterbury City). And were runners-up in the Reserves League Cup to Sittingbourne in 1986‚Äì87. In the early 1990s there were several big-money and new record transfers: Just before Christmas 1990 the club sold forward partnership Jeff Ross and Dave Arter to Hythe Town for a combined fee of ¬£25,000 ‚Äì a club record single receipt. Three years later in 1993 a single player record of ¬£20,000 was received from Sittingbourne for Lee McRobert. And the following year a record of ¬£7,000 was paid by Ashford to Sittingbourne to bring Jeff Ross and Dave Arter back to Ashford. Arter holds the career club record for goal scoring with 197 goals scored. For the 1990‚Äì91 season in the Southern Division the 'Town' came under player-manager Neil Cugley who came in from Herne Bay. For his first five seasons of Cugley's tenure the fans saw a series of comfortable top ten league finishes. During this period the old cup spirit of the Southern League South Division 'Nuts and Bolts' stirred as they lifted the 1992‚Äì93 Kent Senior Cup beating Isthmian Premier League Bromley 3‚Äì2 with Andy Pearson and Lee McRobert (2) netting. This was followed two seasons later with the appearance of Ashford Town in the First Round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in 20 years ‚Äì Neil had been a non-playing member of Ashfords squad in their last appearance in the First Round in 1974‚Äì75. This was the start of a run of three years reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup. 1993‚Äì94 the side finished a creditable sixth place in the Southern Division, this was a great achievement losing only once in 22 matches from 8 February to the season end. The Nuts & Bolts also reached the semi-final of the Eastern Floodlit Cup, but were soundly beaten at Braintree 2‚Äì6 paying the price for the heavy toll of fixtures at the climax of the season. The 1994‚Äì95 FA Cup match was at home to Fulham and watched by a Homelands record crowd of 3,363, Neil Cugley's side achieved a more than creditable draw 2‚Äì2 against their Third Division opponents. On a heavy waterlogged pitch in front of Sky TV Ashford took a two-goal lead (through Jeff Ross and Dave Arter) before two late controversial penalties both converted by Micky Adams rescued the League team. The Town succumbed 5‚Äì3 after extra time at Craven Cottage in the replay. The season also marked only the second time in post-war football that Ashford scored in excess of 100 league goals ‚Äì their 106 was second only to the 109 scored by the 1948‚Äì49 Kent League winning team. Over the course of the season, which saw 5th place attained in the league, the side scored an overall total of 151 goals in all competitive matches, with hot shot Dave Arter banging in 45. This total included four league hat-tricks and in a pulsating home weekend season finale, Arter scored four in a 6‚Äì1 win v Bashley (Sat 29 April 1994),then the following day (Sun 30 April 1994) hit a treble versus Weymouth in a 6‚Äì0 victory. Then just for good measure he added four in the final match of the season which was a 5‚Äì2 victory at Witney Town on 6 May 1994. The league season ended in fine style with the side establishing a new club league record winning run of seven matches. Fast- paced winger Mark Stanton could well have matched Arter's total of 45 had he not missed the season end through injury after scoring 35 times in 46 appearances. His total included an Ashford Town record of five in a game during a 6‚Äì1 Southern League Cup victory at Erith & Belvedere on 18 October 1994, whilst also scoring nine times in the magical FA Cup run. For the 1995‚Äì96 season the first round draw saw Ashford paired with non-league Bognor Regis Town, with the tie at Bognor. Ashford did the hard work, achieving a 1‚Äì1 draw on the south coast but lost 0‚Äì1 at home in the replay. The match a complete anti-climax and after being delayed by a power cut, Carlton Wynter then hit the post in the opening minute, the hosts just knew it just wasn't going to be their night. It was also the first time the club had been knocked out in the 'proper' rounds of the cup by a fellow non-league team. Perhaps the team were trying to save the supporters the trauma of a trip to Peterborough (the scene of the 1972‚Äì73 FA Trophy semi-final defeat) who awaited them in the next round. In addition to the national cup competition highlight the 1995‚Äì96 was a successful campaign elsewhere. On the local cup front the club won the Kent Senior Cup beating Charlton 3‚Äì0 in the final. And on the League front Ashford gained promotion to the Southern League Premier Division as a result of the team's second-placed finish to Sittingbourne in the Southern Division. For the third cup run, in the 1996‚Äì97 season, the first round tie saw Ashford once again meet non-league opposition in the form of Dagenham And Redbridge. Following a 2‚Äì2 draw on home turf Ashford visited the 'Daggers' for the replay: the match ended 1‚Äì1 but Ashford progressed to the second round by winning 4‚Äì3 on penalties, with the vital penalty scored by Paul Chambers, who would later become Ashford United Manager. In the second Round Ashford were drawn away at Watford and they more than matched their higher ranked opponents in a goalless first-half, but eventually the Vicarage Road side ran out 5‚Äì0 winners, with substitute David Connolly grabbing a late hat-trick to guide the hosts to victory. In the League for 1996‚Äì97 their return season to the Southern League Premier Division (now with the sponsor Dr Martens) was disappointing. With a finishing position of 19th the club was only saved from relegation by the resignation of Sudbury Town. This precipitated the end of Neil Cugley's seven year managerial reign (he moved on to Folkestone) and he was replaced by Nigel Donn who had joined the playing staff the previous season from Dover Athletic. The results for the 1997‚Äì98 campaign did not improve and relegation couldn't be evaded as 21st place saw the Town return to the Southern Division. But the big news for 1998 was not the relegation but rather the news of a take-over of the indebted club by a consortium headed by former England forward Rodney Marsh. They would not only clear the club debts but planned a development of the Homelands site. The deal ultimately collapsed but the ownership of the freehold of Homelands was now separated from the football operation. As a safeguard a Trust of former club directors placed a covenant on the ground which stipulated that a new stadium had to be built if the Homelands site was sold for development. Along came another consortium fronted by John Gurney but they were unable to continue financing the club. The football club survived when Tim Thorogood acquired the football club in 2001 and struck a lease arrangement with the owners of the Homelands freehold. During all this ownership upheaval there was a merry-go-round of managers over the next few years. The club appointed George Wakeling from Bromley early in 1999. He persuaded former England international Paul Parker to take on the role of Director of football. The league engaged in another reorganising and renaming exercise for 1999‚Äì2000 and Ashford now competed as a Southern League, Division One Eastern team. Wakeling had the team topping the league table in the autumn of 1999 as the side lost just once in 18 league matches. This unbeaten run included an Ashford Town record of eight straight league wins from 16 October 1999 to 13 November 1999, scoring 21 goals, whilst conceding only four. This winning streak equalled a previous run of wins under Neil Cugley, however the Cugley run was over two seasons, after the side won the opening game of season 1995‚Äì96, having won the last seven at the end of season 1994‚Äì95. Things then took a nosedive for Messrs Wakeling & Parker, amidst all the turmoil of the takeover and after a run of just one win in seven and the pair were duly sacked on 10 January 2000. They were replaced by Tony Reynolds and he was replaced a year later by Tommy Sampson (who had taken Deal Town to victory in the FA vase final the previous season). The team achieved a run of mid-table league finishes at this time. For the 2000‚Äì01 season in order to differentiate it from the similarly named team from Middlesex, the club became known as Ashford Town (Kent) and known as this the team advanced to the 4th round (the last 32) of the FA trophy. They were defeated in Weymouth 1‚Äì3 to end 'Towns' best run in the competition since 1972‚Äì73. With the takeover of the club ownership by Tim Thorogood in 2001 he assumed team management. The team reached the semi-final of the Kent Senior Cup where they were on the wrong end of a heavy 5‚Äì0 defeat at Football Conference club Margate. There followed a period of relative stability with the 'nuts and bolts' recording mid table finishes for the final few years in the Division 1 Eastern of the Southern League: 2003‚Äì2004 marked Ashford's last as a Southern League club after 44 years under their umbrella ‚Äì there was more reorganisation afoot of the non-league scene. Isthmian League (2004‚Äì2010) The 2004‚Äì05 season reorganisation was brought about by the introduction of a North and South regional Conference leagues below the Premier. There was also the establishment of boundaries between the Southern and Isthmian League (which hitherto had overlapped). After it was all done and dusted Ashford Town found themselves in the Ryman sponsored Isthmian League Division One. This was a further demotion down the non-league structure for the club who were now in what was referred to as 'step 4' of non-league football (i.e. four levels below the Football League). For 2004‚Äì05 the team moved away from their green and white strip and played in lime green shirts and blue shorts. In October 2004 owner/manager Tim Thorogood appointed former England player Terry Fenwick as manager. After a run of poor results he quit three months later. The team finished the season 20th of 22 teams. Supporters concerns for the existence of the club were raised by a carry-over from the ground ownership saga when it was claimed the club had not paid rent (of ¬£2,500pa) for three years and had ¬£10,000 unpaid arrears with the Inland Revenue. The issues however were all resolved, Thorogood remained in control and the team continued in the Isthmian League. But performance in the league in 2005‚Äì06 continued in a poor vein (21 out of 23). For the following season the league split into two regional divisions with 'Nuts and Bolts' in the Southern division for 2006‚Äì07. There was a further change in team control in October when John Cumberbatch was appointed sole manager from the role of joint-manager he had held for a season. The league finish was poor but the back-room staff led by Elaine Osbourne won an award for the best club match day programme in the division. March 2007 saw further changes in ownership of the club. Tim Thorogood sold ownership to a new joint-ownership team of Tony Betteridge and Don Crosbie. They had acquired the freehold interest in the Homelands site in 2006 and thus this transaction reunited the club with ownership of the stadium. They also announced that Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright was to become Director of Football Strategy at the club. The start of the 2007‚Äì08 season saw former Northampton Town and Dover manager Clive Walker appointed as manager. The directors reported they had spent half a million pounds in refurbishing the homelands facilities and the team returned to a green and white strip. Walker didn't last long as manager and at the end of October he was replaced by former Wales International Steve Lovell. There was minor triumph for the club in 2007‚Äì08 with the Reserve team winning the Kent Reserves League Cup (defeating Dartford) and finishing as runners-up (to Dover) in the Kent League Reserves Division 2. Although Lovell managed the club to respectable upper-mid table finishes most of the action over the next couple of years seasons took place off the field. In the summer of 2008 Director Crosbie announced plans for a Sports Village at Homelands. But within a year the relationship between the joint-owners turned sour A year later the boardroom dispute escalated. The split in the boardroom affected the on-field performance and the club barely clung to their Division One status in 2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì only by beating Chatham in their final game. At the end of the season, with an impasse at boardroom level, the club had an unpaid debt to Ebbsfleet United and under Football Association rules whilst this remained unpaid they were suspended from competition. In the courts the row between Betteridge and Crosbie was finally resolved with administration for the club and Betteridge buying the club from the Administrator. However the settlement came too late for the club to compete in the 2010‚Äì11 season. The summer of 2010 therefore marked the end of Ashford Town FC after a history of 80 years. During this time they had won only one League championship ‚Äì the Kent league in 1948‚Äì49 but had enjoyed a few promotions and cup exploits along the way. Although relegation had usually followed shortly after the promotions the post war record of the team was that they had never for any season finished bottom of their League ‚Äì albeit it was close on more than one occasion!Football Club History Database: Ashford Town stats. Kent League / Southern Counties East Football League (2011‚Äì2017) During what transpired to be a short one-season hiatus the club was reformed as Ashford UnitedWe are United Ashford United FC (harking back to before the Ashford Town days). The club adopted the same crest as their forerunners, Ashford Town, except of course the word 'United' now replaced 'Town' and the simple wording 'Founded 1930' was expanded to 'Founded 1891, Reformed 2011'. The home ground for the club remained at 'Homelands'. Under FA rules the 'new' Ashford United were not permitted to re-join the league where their predecessors had left-off: for their inaugural season of 2011‚Äì12 they were placed into 'step 6' football in the newly formed Kent Invicta League. Initially the club appointed former manager Tony Reynolds as manager for the 2011‚Äì12 season but owing to personal commitments he stepped aside and Paul Chambers took up the reins. After an indifferent start to their first season results improved over the second half and the team finished in fifth position. Their finishing position improved two places in the 2012‚Äì13 season to third, with the new \\"United\\" setting a record with six straight league victories, which was just two less than the eight match winning streak twice achieved by Ashford Town, the side actually went unbeaten in their first twelve league games. An individual player record as United was also established with forward Mo Takalo (Takalobighashi) scoring in each of these six matches. Although only the teams finishing in the top two positions were eligible for automatic promotion to the Kent League, Ashford United were awarded promotion instead of the second placed club Hollands & Blair, as Ashford had the facilities and ground grading in place in order to take the promotion. During the close season the Kent League renamed itself as the Southern Counties East Football League. The names of opposing clubs were more familiar to long-time Ashford supporters than in the previous league with clubs from Canterbury, Deal and Tunbridge Wells as opponents. After a positive start on the pitch to the 2013‚Äì14 season it was announced in November 2013 by owner Tony Betteridge that he had relinquished his ownership of the club and the Homelands freehold to a company whose Director was the wife of Don Crosbie ‚Äì the director he had fought for ownership of the club back in 2010. In the 2013‚Äì14 season's cup competitions the team reached the last 32 of the FA Vase competition and reached the Final of the Kent Senior Trophy played at Tonbridge, where they lost 0‚Äì4 to Beckenham Town. During a good campaign Ashford went on a 10 match winning league run from 14 September 2013 to 18 February 2014 and United topped their league around Christmas 2013. However fixture congestion due to their cup exploits saw a slight dip in form with the team having to play three games a week in the closing weeks of the season and they finished in second position. The following season was in some ways a re-run of the previous one with a last 32 appearance in the FA Vase and a runners-up finish in the league. A return including seven draws and two defeats in the first sixteen league matches meant the 'Nuts and Bolts' were always playing catch-up to eventual 2014‚Äì15 league winners Phoenix Sports. The team did though put together a run of thirteen successive victories and were the only club to record a league victory over the league champions, but in the end Phoenix proved worthy champions by an eight-point margin. A noteworthy occurrence of the season was the breaking of the Ashford club post-war single season goalscoring record by Stuart Zanone (who signed seven competitive games into the season) with 47 goals in 35 appearances. Stuart was also the winner of the league Golden Boot award for the season. Included in his record haul was a club record all seven goals in a 7‚Äì0 victory over Lingfield. The previous club season goalscorer record had been established by Alan Morton playing for Ashford Town forty-two years previously. The incredible goalscoring season by Zanone was a dream for a football statistician, as not only did he surpass Morton's 46 goal haul, he also beat Mo Takalo's new \\"United\\" record by scoring in seven successive appearances from 8 November 2014 to 27 December 2014. Overall, he also found the net in 11 consecutive league appearances (18 Oct 2014 to 28 February 2015), as well as scoring 28 goals in 11 consecutive away games, a run started on 18 October 2014 which ended with his one-man seven goal show at Lingfield on 24 March 2015. As the 2014‚Äì15 season ended the club announced that the natural grass pitch at the Homelands (which had a history of poor drainage leading to postponed fixtures) was to be replaced during the close season with a synthetic 3G playing surface ‚Äì this mooted as being the first stage of a sports village redevelopment plan to ensure a steady source of income for the club owners. The installation of the new pitch was delayed owing in part to Operation Stack which caused the delay in delivery of materials required for construction of the pitch. As a result, several early 2015‚Äì16 season home fixtures for both United and tenants Canterbury City were postponed. This though was only the start of events sparked by the pitch installation: in November 2015 the company who had financed the installation (V Bar Limited via its lending arm of Minotaur) claimed not all financial matters had been disclosed at the time of the investment and demanded repayment of the loan. This was disputed by the club owners but they couldn't prevent the ownership of the Homelands ground being transferred via court proceedings to V Bar; then in February news broke of a disputed winding-up petition being filed against the football club company ‚Äì which was indeed overturned by the court. Owing to the financial situation the League levied a 10 point deduction. The football club owners continue to dispute and legally challenge matters. These on-going disputes detracted from an otherwise more than satisfactory 2015‚Äì16 season on the pitch ‚Äì albeit it was without silverware. It actually started inauspiciously when after just two games of the season, the manager Paul Chambers was relieved of his duties after four years and 171 matches in charge following a heavy 1‚Äì5 loss in the FA Cup to fellow SCEFL side Cray Valley PM on 15 August 2015. Former Ashford Town defender Danny Lye ‚Äì who had returned to the Homelands as a player in December 2014 ‚Äì was duly appointed as player-manager until the end of the season. After a run of four defeats and two draws over his first ten league matches whilst he re-fashioned his squad Lye saw only two more league defeats and 18 victories in the remaining 25 league matches to see the team finish third in the table (which would have been second, nine points behind winners Greenwich Borough had it not been for the ten points deduction). The club went two rounds better than previously in the FA Vase: after a replay win away in the north-east at Gateshead based Northern League Dunston UTS they reached the last eight before being eliminated by former Southern League rival Salisbury. It was heartbreak once again in the Kent Senior Trophy final though where the 'nuts and bolts' lost out in a penalty shoot-out 6‚Äì7 to Sheppey United in the final. The previous season's top scorer Stuart Zanone left early in the season but his record of scoring in seven consecutive matches was eclipsed by veteran forward Shaun Welford who had been brought in as player-assistant manager from Hythe Town). He strung together a run of scoring in nine consecutive matches, which was last achieved in Ashford colours by Lee McRobert for the former Town side during season 1999‚Äì2000. Welford also finished as club top scorer, netting on 37 occasions: 31 league plus six cup goals. The club began the 2016‚Äì17 season with the legal dispute from the previous campaign unresolved. Against this backdrop the returning player coach Danny Lye put together a strong squad with many players returning from the previous campaign and with several strong additions ‚Äì although the club asked the supporters to contribute towards the playing budget. Off-pitch matters continued to feature: December brought news that, despite being in top spot in the league table, the club had not registered with the FA for acceptance for promotion. The club stated their application had not been received by the FA and in light of this mitigating circumstance the club appealed and in mid-February the FA accepted the application. Whilst this played-out news came that the teams' league organisation had deemed the 3G pitch at the Homelands as unsuitable for matches and the owners Minotuar stating ¬£220,000 remedial work would be required. They however gained a temporary dispensation from the FA against the league decision which allowed matches to continue to be played on the pitch. Mid-March brought an announcement that the legal dispute between the club and ground owners had been settled and ownership of the Homelands had been transferred back to the football club. Subsequently, the pitch and facilities passed ground grading requirements. Amongst all this a new Director, Derek Pestridge, was appointed and a legal charge over the ground was established in his favour against an interest-free ¬£500,000 loan made to the club company. On the pitch the team challenged all season at the top of the SCEFL Premier Division. In a pivotal match at the Homelands at the start of April they defeated their closest rivals in the table Crowborough Athletic. It was the only defeat the Crows suffered all season on their travels and although they had established a one-nil lead, a hat-trick from Rory Hill saw the Nuts and Bolts triumph. It put the clubs level on points but crucially Ashford had a superior goal difference and victories in the remaining five matches of the campaign meant they clinched the SCEFL Premier League title and promotion to Division One South of the Isthmian League. It was a season of records: most league wins (30 out of 38 games); most league points (92); highest Homelands league attendance for Ashford United of 807; and in scoring 119 goals, the club record of 115 scored by Ashford Town in the Kent League of 1931‚Äì32 was eclipsed. There was also success in the Kent Senior Trophy where after twice in previous years being runners-up United lifted the trophy with a 2‚Äì1 win (both goals from Shaun Welford) over Cray Valley PM on neutral turf at Maidstone. There was too a personal record for Shaun Welford (who with a hat- trick in the season's last match) notched 48 goals in all matches (with 37 and the Golden Boot in league matches) beating Start Zanone's record of 47 from two seasons previously. With the legal/stadium disputes settled and promotion achieved the close of the 2016‚Äì17 season saw the team return to where their forerunners Ashford Town had been when they ceased existence seven years previously. Isthmian League (2017‚Äì ) Ashford returned to the IsthmianLeague for the 2017‚Äì18 season. Any thoughts of a successful season were quickly extinguished with defeats in the first two games which led to the club parting company with manager Danny Lye and subsequent departure of experienced players. Youth team coach Jason Whitmore was appointed manager but having to rebuild the squad ‚Äì and in the interim fielding inexperienced youth team players ‚Äì led to a continued run of poor results including an autumn run of 12 league matches without a win (10 losses; 2 draws). During January the club appointed experienced former manager of Greenwich Borough Gary Alexander as Whitmore's assistant with a plan for the former to take over as manager the following season. There was a significant turnover of players with 78 players donning the club's jersey over the season; the highest appearance by any player was 32 (Jonathan Difford and Pat Kingwell); 31 players played in 3 or fewer matches; there were 21 goalscorers with Max Watters topping the list with 8 (from 27 appearances). The previous season had been one of positive records this one featured negatives: in conceding a record 111 goals over the league campaign it was the first time that in excess of over 100 had been conceded by either Town or United; the goal difference of negative 51 was similarly an unwanted record; the 28 league losses was the worst since the record 29 in the 1997‚Äì98 campaign; the Nuts and Bolts 9‚Äì1 defeat at Cray Wanderers was the record league-wide scoring/winning margin match of the season. The team finished 21st from 24 clubs in the league and thus maintained their league status. With Gary Alexander in position as manager the 2018‚Äì19 season started well with three wins. This though was followed by a league run of five defeats and two draws and early exit from FA Cup and Trophy competitions. Three successive wins in November looked to have got the team back on track and seventh in the table but the manager was sacked (via a Saturday evening text message) at the end of November. He was immediately replaced by Tommy Warrilow who had become available following the early season demise of Thamesmead Town. Warrilow had been a former Ashford Town player in the mid-nineties and had a solid non-league management record at Tonbridge Angels and Cray Wanderers. Under the new manager the team won fifteen and drew three of the remaining twenty-three matches of the season, achieving a fourth- placed finish in the league and a promotion play-off spot. The team achieved the league second fewest goals conceded and second highest goal difference; Danny Parish was top scorer over the league campaign with 24 goals from the 26 games he played, with Sam Corne second with 15. In the play-off semi-final the Nuts and Bolts played on a Monday night in front of 1,123 spectators at Hastings United and ran-out 3‚Äì2 victors; twice coming from a goal behind with strikes from Jay May and Sam Corne and the latter converted a penalty one minute from the end of extra time for the deciding goal. For the promotion final Ashford played away at Horsham; owing to the arrangement of the 'step four' play-off scheme only five of seven league play-off winners (decided on a regular season league points per game basis) would gain promotion, which meant given their record Ashford could not be rewarded with promotion had they won. The outcome was decided on the pitch though as the Ashford team were defeated 2‚Äì1 after extra-time. Supporters United's traditional rivals remain as Folkestone Invicta, Maidstone United & Hythe Town, whereas in recent years the likes of Sevenoaks Town, Greenwich Borough & Beckenham Town are also considered rivals. United fans also endure friendly rivalries with Tunbridge Wells, Sheppey United and Fisher, as in recent years they were the only other teams United played against at Southern Counties level that also had vocal supporters. United have since 2011 boasted higher attendances than around 80% of other English teams at Step 8 & 9 level. The supporter's independent social media network is one of the largest in non-league below the National League. The vocal section renamed itself the FAMOUS NUTS AND BOLTS in 2018 and again claim to be one of the largest in Kent at this level. United fans became famous across the Football network in early 2018 as they took around 90 fans to an away game in Guernseyhttps://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/sport/thanks- to-the-fans-159387/ a feat that was almost triple the previous record held by Hastings United when they took 31 a year prior. Players Ground Ashford have played at the Homelands Stadium since it was built in 1989 ‚Äì returning to the town after a two year-ground share at Folkestone. The record attendance at the ground is 3,363 for a match against Fulham in the first round of the 1994‚Äì95 FA Cup. Many teams have ground-shared at the Homelands: In 2004 Conference South club Margate spent a season sharing the ground while they tried to bring their Hartsdown Park stadium up to standard; from 2009 Maidstone United played at the stadium for two seasons whilst their Gallagher Stadium ground was built; Between 2014 and 2017 fellow SCEFL club Canterbury City were tenants ‚Äì they were a nomad club without their own home ground and had previously played at Herne Bay and moved on to Faversham. As of the start of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Ashford's second team Kennington will play at the Homelands in order to compete in the Southern Counties East Football League Division Two. Over the years the poor drainage and wear of the pitch at the Homelands had caused matches to be postponed. At the conclusion of the 2014‚Äì15 season the club began installing a new state of the art synthetic 3G pitch of a FIFA 2 rated standard for use the following season, albeit construction was delayed and it was not available until shortly after the commencement of the 2015‚Äì16 season.

Development HUD contrasting with newer versions. Inspired by Battlezone, BZFlag was first written in C by Chris Schoeneman in 1992, as a part of his studies at Cornell University. BZFlag was initially called \\"bz\\" and despite its similarity to the SGI game of the same title by Chris Fouts, both games were completely independent of each other. In 1993, BZFlag was released to the public for the first time. This release took a new turn compared to older versions after a cheater, who edited the source code of his client to give himself powers that do not come from official releases, inspired Schoeneman and Pasetto to add \\"super-flags.\\" Super flags affect a tank's performance by adding abilities or weapons to its arsenal. The first four flags were High Speed (boosted tank speed), Quick Turn (tank turned faster), Rapid Fire (shots moved faster), and Oscillation Overthruster (tank could go through objects). There was only one of each flag, and all flags had a marker on them so tanks knew what type it was. Soon after, bad and good flags were added, and the idea remains part of game play today; however, flags do not have markers and the flag type is unknown to the player until it is picked up (unless the player's tank is carrying an identify flag). In 1997, the release of version 1.7d came with a groundbreaking new feature: an in-game public server list. Previously, players had to either set up their own servers, know of servers, or read a list published and maintained by a third-party. Now the server list is hosted on the official BZFlag website and allows anybody to play games on servers that choose to be public. Schoeneman eventually re-wrote BZFlag in C++ for SGI's third IndiZone competition, which won in the \\"Reality Engine\\" category. Tim Riker was later given the project prior to version 1.7e to maintain and evolve. BZFlag is written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering. Its audio and several other sub-systems have been written using OS specific methods, although newer releases use SDL to perform low-level operations on all platforms. Textures for in-game objects are loaded from PNG files; audio, from WAVs. Zlib is used to decompress data files, which is written in C. A high-resolution screenshot of v2.0.14 running within Slackware Linux. x24 full-scene anti-aliasing is enacted externally by the system's video driver. This exhibits the game's best-possible graphics rendering and its full compatibility with the drivers of high-end video cards.  Developers  The number of contributors to the project has steadily increased over time. The project invites all sufficiently experienced developers to contribute. Though there are 64 listed developers, a much smaller number of those are active contributors. Developers are able to edit any of the project's files to make changes at any time. However, when a developer has made an edit of which other developers do not approve, or is inappropriate for the game, they are requested to revert to the previous version of the file; most developers monitor source edits on IRC. The copyright holder for the game is Tim Riker but maintenance is guided by Scott Wichser and Jeff Makey as project managers. The game's original author, Chris Schoeneman, is no longer involved in development.  Gameplay  The official logo for BZFlag from version 2.4.8 In a game of BZFlag, players drive around tanks, viewed from a first-person view, in a server-defined world (also known as a \\"map\\"), which can be modified. Tanks have the ability to drive through other tanks, but cannot travel through buildings or other world objects. The basic objective is to destroy opponents' tanks, which are tanks of another team's color. Since all players can see the position of all the tanks on their radar, it is a game of outmaneuvering rather than sneaking. There are styles of game play that modify the objective. Styles are server-based, as the server operator chooses what style to host. If there is no special style indicated by the server owner, the only objective is the above (to simply kill opponent tanks); it is called a \\"free for all\\", or \\"FFA\\" for short. There are three other objectives and corresponding styles (four in total): a style called \\"capture-the-flag\\" (or \\"CTF\\" for short) in which tanks try to pick up an opponent's flag and bring to their own home base, a style called \\"rabbit chase\\" in which the objective is to have every hunter (orange)tank try to destroy a particular white tank, called the \\"rabbit,\\" and a style called \\"King of the Hill,\\" in which a team attempts to stay in a certain area for 30‚Äì60 seconds without being killed. If they succeed, that team becomes \\"The King of the Hill.\\" Servers can change the game mode and have custom maps made to fit the properties of the game. Certain thresholds are used to catch malicious players and kick them off the server, as well as message filters and an entire collection of other anti-cheating features. There are around 250 servers active at any given time (although only about 10-20% have active players most of the time).  Teams  Tanks can join as one of the four team colors, as a rogue, or as an observer. Observers cannot play, but can move anywhere in the world and watch what the tank they are linked to is doing. Observers do not have a tank and are therefore not visible to players, but are shown in the scoreboard. The colored teams are Red, Green, Blue and Purple. Rogue players are teamless players: they are allowed to kill colored team players and other rogues. Rogue tanks are colored dark grey out the window, and yellow on the radar. In rabbit-hunt games there is a white tank, known as the \\"rabbit\\", against the orange-brown \\"hunters\\", or every other player. The hunters are considered a team, so rabbits with genocide, shockwave, Guided Missile, or Laser flags are dangerous, and often team kills occur due to a group assault on the \\"rabbit.\\" Teams are necessary in capture-the-flag games, in which they have to protect their team flag from capture. Because rogues are occasionally allowed on servers, a rogue tank does not have any flag to defend, and in turn cannot capture flags. However, rogues usually tend to aid other teams of choice, or merely enjoy adding a distraction to all teams. There is a plugin to prevent this, however it is only used on servers with two large teams and one or two rogue players.  Maps  A screenshot of BZFlag 2.4.6 client visiting a Ducati map with snow and mirror effect. A BZFlag server can be configured to create a basic, random map for play, or users can load custom map files. BZFlag uses a customized text based map format to define the placement of objects. While writing a map is fairly simple in this format, most map-makers use a 3d modeling program such as Wings 3D or blender. Graphical map editors, BZEdit or iBZEdit have also been used. Note that BZEdit is not distributed with the game, and is no longer under active development (versions of it are available at the BZFlag SourceForge.net site). However, using blender in combination with a BZFlag map plug-in is currently the most popular mapping method. As to the simplicity of maps, there are a number of basic objects in a map: boxes, pyramids, teleporters, cones, arcs, cylinders, spheres, team bases and meshes. Teleporters are rectangular, yellow-bordered objects that teleport a tank to another teleporter. A mapmaker may choose to not have a teleporter teleport tanks by leaving out links, or simple definitions of two points for teleporters to link between. Teleporters are also capable of teleporting to themselves, reflecting bullets and tanks that enter. Team Bases are used for CTF style games. Full three dimensional meshes have been available in maps since the 2.0 release.  Flags  In observer mode as a green tank and a rogue tank battle against each other. The rogue clearly destroys the green tank as the rogue has Guided Missiles. Taken from low-resolution mode in version 2.0BZFlag has three types of flags: team flags, bad flags and super flags. Team flags are only placed in a world during a capture-the-flag game, and represent the team it is colored to. Super flags are flags that can be in both free-for-all games and capture-the-flag games, but are strongly controlled by a server operator. The number, types of super flags, as well as where they are placed can all be controlled by the operator. Super flags come in both bad and good form, and affect a tank accordingly. A bad flag may take away a certain sense of the tank: its sight, speed, or related things, while a good flag does the opposite and actually helps a tank. Good super flags are usually held until the tank is killed and explodes, or until the player driving the tank chooses to drop the flag. Bad flags are dropped after a short amount of time, after a certain number of \\"wins\\", or until the tank dies. The rules for dropping bad flags are set by the operator. All super flags have a one or two letter code that is displayed next to a player's name on the scoreboard when that player has that flag. Once in a while, a new flag is introduced, which anyone can contribute to via developer contact or the wiki. The player fires a Guided Missile at a ground target while the opposing green team's flag is taken from their base, all while a tank has exploded slightly below.  Server environment  Servers have environments that simulate the real world. A server's environment consists of three things: The map in play, the time of day that is being simulated, and weather conditions, introducing elements of which players have no control, like rain, snow, icy and/or slippery ground, modified friction and gravity, and fog. BZFlag takes the local time from the geographical location of the server and creates a night or day-time atmosphere in the background. Servers may synchronize the local server time or allow players to change the time to any time they may desire. Critical reception BZFlag was selected in Summer 2015 as \\"HotPick\\" by Linux Format.Linux Format Summer 2015 page 56 BZFlag was selected as the SourceForge.net Project of the Month for April 2004. Both Free Software Magazine and Linux Magazine noted that BZFlag was fun to play and suitable for younger gamers.

He is best known for his teaching Taoist practices under the names of Healing Tao, Tao Yoga, Universal Healing Tao System and Qi Gong. He has run numerous workshops, written a series of books, and published a number of training videos. He views himself primarily as a teacher.Chia & Winn (1984). Pg IV.  Biography  Mantak Chia was born to a Chinese family in Thailand in 1944. He was raised in a Christian family; his father was a Baptist minister. He began studying the Buddhist method of \\"stilling the mind\\" at the age of six, and later he studied Muay Thai boxing, T'ai chi ch'uan, Kung Fu and Taoist and Buddhist meditation practices from several masters. Of all his masters, the most influential one was Yi Eng (White Cloud), an eremitic member of the Dragon's Gate sect of the Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) school of TaoismMiller (2006). Pg 268.Kohn (2008). Pg 221. (Chinese: ÈÅìÂÆ∂ÂÖ®ÁúûÈæçÈñÄÊ¥æ), who taught Mantak Chia a complete Taoist training system and authorized him to teach and heal. Later, he studied Western anatomy and medical science for two years to better understand the physiological mechanisms behind healing energy. He established his first Universal Healing Tao school in Thailand in 1974 after systematizing his knowledge of Taoism. He founded the Universal Healing Tao Center (originally named the Taoist Esoteric Yoga Center) in New York in 1979. The center attracted a broad variety of European and American students, and some of them greatly helped him in teaching Taoist practices to western students. He returned to Thailand in 1994 and created the Universal Tao Training Center‚ÄîTao Garden‚Äîin Chiang Mai. He not only teaches at Tao Garden but also tours to other countries of the world to teach and promote the Healing Tao practices every year.  Spiritual Core  Rooted in traditional Taoist practices, Chia's teaching system develops integrated physical, mental and spiritual (energy) bodies internal to human beings. The focus is on developing human life energy ‚Äî Qi ‚Äî for self-healing and life transformation.  Lineage  Chia's lineage is that of the Dragon's Gate sect of the Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) school of Taoism (Chinese: ÈÅìÂÆ∂ÂÖ®ÁúûÈæçÈñÄÊ¥æ). This sect takes the practical approach in studying Taoist Inner Alchemy (Chinese: ÂÖß‰∏πÂØ¶‰øÆÊ¥æ). It emphasizes knowledge and method that are effective to develop the states of inner experience and consciousness that are the birthright of all humans and accessible by all, without unnecessary rituals. After having inherited the complete Taoist internal spiritual cultivation system from his master, Yi Eng, Chia followed the master's instruction to teach it to others.  Nine Formulas  The first two formulas are probably the most famous parts of Mantak Chia's teaching. However, they are not the core of the system. The purpose of the two formulas is to invoke one's awareness of qi, to strengthen it, and to open important qi channels in one's body, such as the governor and functional channels. These practices build a solid foundation for later formulas. Sexual energy plays very important roles in qi cultivation. Taoist practitioners believe that the sexual energy accounts for a large part of the energy that a human body generates, and a person cannot achieve spiritual fulfillment without conserving and leveraging the power of the sexual energy. The first step of traditional inner alchemy (Chinese: ÂÖß‰∏π) is transforming the material carrier of sexual energy (Jing) into Qi. The second formula lays a solid foundation for this purpose. However, because sex is a \\"hot\\" topic in a society, teaching sexual practices might be controversial. The third formula, Fusion, really starts inner alchemy practices. Inner alchemy traditionally has three stages: transforming jing to qi, transforming qi to shen, returning shen to void. Qi and shen are inner life energies with shen being a more refined level, and both originate from the same original universe force. In Kan Li practices, one should have developed strong qi of all kinds so that intercourses of different qi take place resulting in a qi entity, call qi pearl (Chinese: ÂÖß‰∏π), inside one's own body. This process is often described by the analogy of intercourses of a female and a male which leads to a fertilized egg. The intensive qi activities create an internal energy body which becomes the center of further practices, and eventually, the internal body leads to Tao, reaching immortality. Cultivating the internal body and merging into Tao are the central practices of Taoist inner alchemy, which require great dedication and determination.  Reception  James Miller thinks that Mantak Chia's teachings of qi and cosmology is similar to the Taoist instructor Hua-ching Ni, but Chia's books lack discussion of philosophy, ethics or everyday practical advice. The system Chia presents is a narrowly focused system of Qi Gong rooted firmly in neidan. Machacek and Wilcox think that Chia's study of Taoist sexuality has the trend in Taoist writings intended for a Western audience, a combination of theoretical knowledge and personal experience, which leads to a proliferation of subjective and modern \\"love manuals\\" and expositions on the Taoist way of love.Machacek & Wilcox (2003). Pg 96. King's College scholar Peter B. Clarke thinks that Chia's Healing Tao is one of the few Thai new religious movements to have achieved an international following.Clarke (2006). Pg 277.

It is operated by the Tennessee Board of Regents and shares a campus with the Tennessee College of Applied Technology at Nashville. The Nashville State facilities include of space for classrooms, labs, offices, student services, and a library. Nashville State offers a wide array of programs and degrees including: degree and certificate studies, university parallel transfer programs, continuing education, adult education, MNPS's Middle College High School, Dual Enrollment and community service programs. Nashville State serves a seven county service area of Middle Tennessee, which includes Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Houston, Humphreys, Montgomery, and Stewart counties. Nashville State is an open-entry postsecondary institution offering almost 50 majors of study toward an AA, AS, AST and AAS degree and 12 certificate programs. In addition, Nashville State offers continuing education courses ranging from technical skills to management training and programs providing training in such areas as computer-aided drafting and office technology.  History  It has its origins in a planned redevelopment of a campus on White Bridge Road which was formerly the site of Thayer Hospital, a hospital operated by what is now the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. When the hospital was relocated adjacent to Vanderbilt University and its Medical Center in the 1960s, part of its former campus became the home of Nashville State Technical Institute. NSTI or Nashville Tech, as it was generally known, was formed to supply the training needed for positions requiring only the Associate's degree or professional certificates, but also to provide the beginning years of a more advanced technical education. At first, liberal arts offerings were essentially the minimum required for the institution to meet these goals, but the plan was always for NSTI to become a full community college. Nashville State opened in 1970 with an enrollment of 398 students. As time went by, and liberal arts offerings increased somewhat, the school was used more and more by students who were looking to complete the first two years of a four-year degree at a more affordable cost. Some of these students found that credits earned at NSTI were hard to transfer to other accredited schools outside of the Tennessee Board of Regents system. A revamping of the curriculum was put in place to address this concern, and concurrently the institution was renamed Nashville State Community College, a pattern which had already been established at the other, similar urban technical institutes in the state. Unlike other community colleges operated by the Tennessee Board of Regents, Nashville State does not conduct any intercollegiate athletics programs. Under the terms of a judicial consent decree, Nashville State must carefully tailor its offerings so as not to be in direct competition for students with Tennessee State University, a historically black university also located in Nashville, which has been ordered by federal court to achieve a higher degree of racial integration. Campuses Nashville State offers classes and programs throughout its seven county service area. There are five campuses offering classes: the main campus, Cookeville, Humphreys County (in Waverly), Southeast Center (in Nashville), and the newest site in Dickson. The college has an enrollment of over 8,000 full- and part-time students enrolled at its campuses and other locations. Main campus The main campus of Nashville State is located at 120 White Bridge Rd. Nashville State Community College - Main Campus, September 2014.

In the book, Barnett outlines his theory of constitutional legitimacy, interpretation, and construction. He argues that the Constitution should be interpreted by its \\"original meaning\\", distinct from the Founding Fathers' original intent.Pe√±alver, Eduardo M. \\"Restoring the Right Constitution?\\" Yale Law Journal. Vol. 116, No. 4, Jan. 2007, pp. 732‚Äì66 Restoring the Lost Constitution was awarded the 2005 Lysander Spooner Award for Advancing the Literature of Liberty by Laissez Faire Books. Summary Restoring the Lost Constitution is broken into four parts, each addressing an aspect of the U.S. Constitution. # Constitutional Legitimacy describes the most common arguments for constitutional legitimacy, and argues against them in practical terms. Barnett suggests that in practice it is impossible for any constitution to derive its legitimacy from consent, but it must rather derive legitimacy through \\"necessity\\" and \\"propriety\\". # Constitutional Method # Constitutional Limits # Constitutional Powers Reception The Journal of Libertarian Studies reviewed the book, stating that \\"though well-intentioned, the book is fatally flawed\\".Huebert, J.H., Journal of Libertarian Studies, VOLUME 19, NO. 2 (SPRING 2005): 103‚Äì09. The Future of Freedom Foundation praised Restoring the Lost Constitution, comparing it to \\"a great symphony on which the composer labored for years, poring over passages again and again to get them just right.\\"Book Review: Restoring the Lost Constitution Future of Freedom Foundation The Atlas Society also reviewed the book, writing \\"Despite its occasional lack of focus, Restoring the Lost Constitution is a succinct and accurate distillation of libertarian constitutional theory‚Äîand it convincingly shows that this phrase is largely redundant.\\"\\"The Normality of Freedom\\". The Atlas Society. Steven G.

Perspectives on Politics. American Political Science Association. Vol. 2, No. 3, Sep. 2004, pp. 564‚Äì66. Ronald Kahn of the Law and Politics Book Review wrote that the book was \\"terrific in demonstrating the natural rights background to our Constitution and demonstrating that all rights cannot be listed in the Constitution\\", but that \\"Barnett's fundamental problem is that he allows for 'constitutional construction' when originalism cannot tell us which meanings to adopt, but he does not seem to allow for social construction of law, or changing social meanings\\".\\"RESTORING THE LOST CONSTITUTION: THE PRESUMPTION OF LIBERTY\\", Law and Politics Book Review In Ethics Matthew Simpson criticized Restoring the Lost Constitution, stating that while Barnett \\"argues persuasively that an unprincipled judiciary poses a great threat to constitutionalism in America ... his own principle for reading the Constitution, the presumption of liberty, is implausible and deeply flawed\\".Simpson, Matthew.

He was the founder of his namesake haute couture house. His contributions to his field have been likened to Picasso's legacy in 20th-century art.Bowles, Hamish. \\"Fashioning the Century.\\" Vogue (May 2007): 236‚Äì250. A condensed version of this article appears online. The Way We Move: How Paul Poiret freed us from the corset, by Josh Patner, Slate, 18 May 2007 Early life and career Poiret was born on 20 April 1879 to a cloth merchant in the poor neighborhood of Les Halles, Paris. His parents, in an effort to rid him of his natural pride, apprenticed him to an umbrella maker. There, he collected scraps of silk left over from the cutting of umbrella patterns, and fashioned clothes for a doll that one of his sisters had given him. While a teenager, Poiret took his sketches to Louise Ch√©ruit, a prominent dressmaker, who purchased a dozen from him. Poiret continued to sell his drawings to major Parisian couture houses, until he was hired by Jacques Doucet in 1898. His first design, a red cloth cape, sold 400 copies. He became famous after designing a black mantle of tulle over a black taffeta, painted by the famous fan painter Billotey. The actress R√©jane used it in a play called Zaza, becoming the stage a typical strategy of Poiret's marketing practices. In 1901, Poiret moved to the House of Worth, where he was responsible for designing simple, practical dresses, called by Gaston Worth as \\"fried potatoes\\" because they were considered side dishes to Worth's main course of \\"truffles\\". The \\"brazen modernity of his designs,\\" however, proved too much for Worth's conservative clientele. When Poiret presented the Russian Princess Bariatinsky with a Confucius coat with an innovative kimono-like cut, for instance, she exclaimed, \\"What a horror! When there are low fellows who run after our sledges and annoy us, we have their heads cut off, and we put them in sacks just like that.\\" This reaction prompted to Poiret to fund his own maison. Poiret's influence expands Poiret established his own house in 1903. In his first years as an independent couturier, he broke with established conventions of dressmaking and subverted other ones. In 1903, he dismissed the petticoat, and later, in 1906, he did the same with the corset. Poiret made his name with his controversial kimono coat and similar, loose- fitting designs created specifically for an uncorseted, slim figure. Poiret designed flamboyant window displays and threw sensational parties to draw attention to his work. His instinct for marketing and branding was unmatched by any other Parisian designer, although the pioneering fashion shows of the British-based Lucile (Lady Duff Gordon) had already attracted tremendous publicity. In 1909, he was so famous, Margot Asquith, wife of British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, invited him to show his designs at 10 Downing Street. The cheapest garment at the exhibition was 30 guineas, double the annual salary of a scullery maid. Paul Poiret was influenced by the Orientalism of the 1910s. In opposition to the Edwardian structure, he took unstructured lengths of fabrics and wrapped them around the body. Poiret's house expanded to encompass interior decoration and fragrance. In 1911, he introduced \\"Parfums de Rosine,\\" named after his daughter, becoming the first French couturier to launch a signature fragrance, although again the London designer Lucile had preceded him with a range of in-house perfumes as early as 1907.Mazzeo, Tilar J., The Secret of Chanel No. 5, (2010), p. 26; Bigham, Randy Bryan, Lucile ‚Äì Her Life by Design (2012), pp. 46‚Äì47. In 1911 Poiret unveiled \\"Parfums de Rosine\\" with a flamboyant soiree held at his palatial home, attended by the cream of Parisian society and the artistic world. Poiret fancifully christened the event \\"la mille et deuxi√®me nuit\\" (The Thousand and Second Night), inspired by the fantasy of a sultan's harem.Mazzeo, Tilar J., The Secret of Chanel No. 5 (2010), p. 25 His gardens were illuminated by lanterns, set with tents, and live, tropical birds. Madame Poiret herself luxuriated in a golden cage. Poiret was the reigning sultan, gifting each guest with a bottle of his new fragrance creation, appropriately named to befit the occasion, \\"Nuit Persane.\\" His marketing strategy, played out as entertainment, became the talk of Paris. A second scent debuted in 1912 ‚Äì \\"Le Minaret,\\" again emphasizing the harem theme. In 1911, publisher Lucien Vogel dared photographer Edward Steichen to promote fashion as a fine art in his work.Niven, Penelope (1997). Steichen: A Biography. New York: Clarkson Potter. , p. 352 Steichen responded by snapping photos of gowns designed by Poiret, hauntingly backlit and shot at inventive angles. These were published in the April 1911 issue of the magazine Art et D√©coration. According to historian Jesse Alexander, the occasion is \\"now considered to be the first ever modern fashion photography shoot,\\" in which garments were imaged as much for their artistic quality as their formal appearance.Alexander, Jesse, \\"Edward Steichen: Lives in Photography,\\" HotShoe magazine, no.151, December/January 2008, pp.66 ‚Äì 67 A year later, Vogel began his renowned fashion journal La Gazette du Bon Ton, which showcased Poiret's designs, drawn by top illustrators, along with six other leading Paris designers ‚Äì Louise Ch√©ruit, Georges Doeuillet, Jacques Doucet, Jeanne Paquin, Redfern, and the House of Worth. However, notable couture names were missing from this brilliant assemblage, including such major tastemakers as Lucile, Jeanne Lanvin and the Callot Soeurs. Also in 1911, Poiret launched the √âcole Martine, a home decor division of his design house, named for his second daughter. The establishment provided artistically inclined, working-class girls with trade skills and income. In 1911 Poiret leased part of the property at 109 Rue du Faubourg Saint Honor√© to his friend Henri Barbazanges, who opened the Galerie Barbazanges to exhibit contemporary art. The building was beside Poiret's 18th century mansion at 26 Avenue d'Antin. Poiret reserved the right to hold two exhibitions each year. One of these was L'Art Moderne en France from 16‚Äì31 July 1916, organized by Andr√© Salmon. Salmon called the exhibition the \\"Salon d'Antin\\". Artists included Pablo Picasso, who showed Les Demoiselles d'Avignon for the first time, Amedeo Modigliani, Mo√Øse Kisling, Manuel Ortiz de Z√°rate and Marie Vassilieff. Poiret also arranged concerts of new music at the gallery, often in combination with exhibitions of new art. The 1916 Salon d'Antin included readings of poetry by Max Jacob and Guillaume Apollinaire, and performances of work by Erik Satie, Darius Milhaud, Igor Stravinsky and Georges Auric. A Poiret costume ball. L-R: Poiret, model, France Matano, unknown Collapse of the Poiret fashion house Early in World War I, Poiret left his fashion house to serve the military. When he returned in 1919, the business was on the brink of bankruptcy. New designers like Chanel were producing simple, sleek clothes that relied on excellent workmanship. In comparison, Poiret's elaborate designs seemed dowdy and poorly manufactured. (Though Poiret's designs were groundbreaking, his construction was not ‚Äì he aimed only for his dresses to \\"read beautifully from afar.\\") In 1922, he was invited to New York to design costumes and dresses for Broadway stars. He took his top designer (France Martano) and an entourage with him, enjoying the elegant life at sea (see photos). New York City, however, was not home and he soon returned to Paris leaving his top designer there in his stead. Back in Paris, Poiret was increasingly unpopular, in debt, and lacking support from his business partners. He soon left the fashion empire he had established. In 1929, the house was closed, its leftover stock sold by the kilogram as rags. When Poiret died in 1944, his genius had been forgotten. His road to poverty led him to odd jobs, including work as a street painter, selling drawings to customers of Paris cafes. At one time, the 'Chambre syndicale de la Haute Couture' discussed providing a monthly allowance to aid Poiret, an idea rejected by Worth, at that time president of the group. Only his friend and one of his right hand-designers from his pre-WWI era, France Martano (married name: Benureau), helped him in his era of poverty, when most of Parisian society had forgotten him. At the end of his life, he dined regularly in her family's Paris apartment and she ensured he was not wanting for food. (He'd previously erased her from his memoirs as, after designating her as his long- term replacement to design for Broadway in 1922, he was infuriated that she became an independent couturier upon her return to Paris.) His friend Elsa Schiaparelli prevented his name from encountering complete oblivion, and it was Schiaparelli who paid for his burial.

L-R: Unknown, France Martano, Paul Poiret, entourage members. 1922 Aesthetic and legacy Though perhaps best known for freeing women from corsets (although he did not single-handedly accomplish this revolution) and for claiming authorship of the hobble skirt, harem pants, and \\"lampshade\\" tunic, Poiret's major contribution to fashion was his development of the dressmaking technique known as draping, a departure from the tailoring and pattern-making of the past.The Metropolitan Museum of Art ‚Äì Special Exhibitions: Poiret: King of Fashion Poiret was influenced by antique and regional dress, and favored clothing cut along straight lines and constructed of rectangular motifs. The structural simplicity of his clothing represented a \\"pivotal moment in the emergence of modernism\\" generally, and \\"effectively established the paradigm of modern fashion, irrevocably changing the direction of costume history. Poiret's spectacular fashion designs feature prominently in the collections of fashion museums worldwide. They have been displayed in many exhibitions over the years. One such exhibition was \\"Paul Poiret and Nicole Groult, The Masters of Art Deco Fashion\\" (Paul Poiret et Nicole Groult, Ma√Ætres de mode Art D√©co) at Palais Galliera in Paris in 1986. In May 2005, the fashion designer Azzedine Ala√Øa exhibited Denise Poiret's wardrobe in a show called \\"Free Creativity\\" (La Cr√©ation en Libert√©) in his showroom before it was auctioned. Denise Poiret's personal sartorial collection broke sales records: in particular, an auto coat that Paul Poiret had designed for her in 1914 went under the hammer for 110,000 Euros. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York purchased many pieces at this auction sale, which was the core of the first American retrospective on the dressmaker from May to August 2007, entitled Paul Poiret: King of Fashion. In 2011, this show traveled to the Kremlin in Russia to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Paul Poiret's visit to Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Additionally, Poiret's perfumes, the Parfums de Rosine, are preserved in several cultural institutions, including the Osmoth√®que in Versailles.Osmoth√®que ‚Äì Conservatoire international des parfums. Official website. Web.https://collections.vam.ac.uk/name/poiret- paul/4496/ In 2013, the Mus√©e International de la Parfumerie in Grasse showcased the pioneering perfume branch of Poiret in an exhibition entitled Paul Poiret: Couturier Perfumer. Personal life In 1905, Poiret married Denise Boulet, a provincial girl; they would later have five children together. Denise, a slender and youthful woman, was Poiret's muse and the prototype of la gar√ßonne. In 1913, Poiret told Vogue, \\"My wife is the inspiration for all my creations; she is the expression of all my ideals.\\" The two later were divorced, in 1928 after twenty-three years of marriage, in a proceeding that was far from amicable due to Poiret's many affairs.  Brand revival  Commercially inactive since 1933, the Poiret brand has attracted the interest of many. Several owners shared the rights to the brand name until the Luxembourg-based company Luvanis, which specializes in reviving dormant brands, acquired the global trademark rights to Paul Poiret in the early 2010s. Luvanis, now the sole owner of Poiret, asked the London investment bank Savigny Partners to find the most suitable entrepreneur. The South-Korean fashion and luxury conglomerate Shinsegae International, which also distributes the brands of Givenchy, C√©line, Brunello Cucinelli, and Moncler, was thus chosen to reawaken Poiret after a long, careful selection process. Luvanis, convinced by Shinsegae's ambition, creative vision, and respect for the heritage of Poiret, sold it the rights to the brand name in 2015. After mounting press speculations, Shinsegae officially confirmed in January 2018 the international relaunch of Poiret from Paris with Belgian businesswoman Anne Chapelle at its helm, and Paris-based Chinese couturiere Yiqing Yin as its artistic director. Poiret is expected to show its first new collection in March 2018 after a 90-year hiatus.

It is about the concept of time and how it is used by humans in modern societies. The full title in German (Momo oder Die seltsame Geschichte von den Zeit-Dieben und von dem Kind, das den Menschen die gestohlene Zeit zur√ºckbrachte) translates to Momo, or the strange story of the time-thieves and the child who brought the stolen time back to the people. The book won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1974. Plot summary In the ruins of an amphitheatre just outside an unnamed city lives Momo, a little girl of mysterious origin. She came to the ruin, parentless and wearing a long, used coat. She is illiterate and cannot count, and she doesn't know how old she is. When asked, she replies, \\"As far as I remember, I've always been around.\\" She is remarkable in the neighbourhood because she has the extraordinary ability to listen--really listen. By simply being with people and listening to them, she can help them find answers to their problems, make up with each other, and think of fun games. The advice given to people \\"go and see Momo!\\" has become a household phrase and Momo makes many friends, especially an honest, silent street-cleaner, Beppo, and a poetic, extroverted tour guide, Gigi (Guido in some translations). This pleasant atmosphere is spoiled by the arrival of the Men in Grey, eventually revealed as a species of paranormal parasites stealing the time of humans. Appearing in the form of grey-clad, grey-skinned, bald men, these strange individuals present themselves as representing the Timesavings Bank and promote the idea of \\"timesaving\\" among the population: supposedly, time can be deposited in the Bank and returned to the client later with interest. After encountering the Men in Grey, people are made to forget all about them, but not about the resolution to save as much time as possible for later use. Gradually, the sinister influence of the Men in Grey affects the whole city: life becomes sterile, devoid of all things considered time-wasting, like social activities, recreation, art, imagination, or sleeping. Buildings and clothing are made exactly the same for everyone, and the rhythms of life become hectic. In reality, the more time people save, the less they have; the time they save is actually lost to them. Instead, it is consumed by the Men in Grey in the form of cigars made from the dried petals of the hour-lilies that represent time. Without these cigars the Men in Grey cannot exist. Momo, however, is a wrench in the plans of the Men in Grey and the Timesavings Bank, thanks to her special personality. The Men in Grey try various plans to deal with her, to derail her from stopping their scheme, but they all fail. When even her closest friends fall under the influence of the Men in Grey in one way or another, Momo's only hope to save the time of mankind are the administrator of Time, Master Secundus Minutus Hora, and Cassiopeia, a tortoise who can communicate through writing on her shell and can see thirty minutes into the future. Momo's adventure takes her from the depths of her heart, which her own time flows from in the form of lovely hour-lilies, to the lair of the Men in Grey themselves, where the time that people believe they are saving is hoarded. After Master Hora stops time, but gives Momo one hour-lily to carry with her, she has exactly one hour to defeat the Men in Grey in a frozen world where only they and she are still moving. She surreptitiously follows them to their underground lair and observes as they decimate their own number in order to stretch their supply of time as far as possible. With the advice of Cassiopeia and by using the hour-lily, Momo is able to shut the door to their vault. Facing extinction as soon as their cigars are consumed, the few remaining Men in Grey pursue Momo, perishing one by one. The very last Man in Grey finally begs her to give him the hour-lily, and when she refuses, he too vanishes remarking that \\"it is good it is over\\". Using the very last minute she has before her hour-lily crumbles, Momo opens the vault again, releasing the millions of hour-lilies stored within. The stolen time returns to its proper owners and goes back to their hearts, causing time to start again (without people knowing it had ever halted). Momo is reunited with her friends, and elsewhere Master Hora rejoices together with Cassiopeia. Major themes The main theme of Momo can be seen as a criticism of consumerism and stress. It describes the personal and social losses produced by unnecessary consumption, and the danger to be driven by a hidden interest group with enough power to induce people into this life style. Michael Ende has also stated to have had the concept of currency demurrage in mind when writing Momo.Michael Ende's last words to the Japanese Childhood is also an important subject in many of Ende's books. In Momo it is used to offer contrast with the adult society. As children have \\"all the time in the world\\", they are a difficult target for the Men in Grey: children can't be convinced that their games are time-wasting. The author uses a mockery of Barbie dolls and other expensive toys as symbols to show how anyone can be persuaded, even indirectly, into consumerism. Literary significance An article by philosopher David Loy and literature professor Linda Goodhew called Momo \\"one of the most remarkable novels of the late twentieth century\\".Goodhew, Linda; and Loy, David, Momo, Dogen, and the Commodification of Time, KronoScope, Volume 2, Number 1, 2002, pp. 97-107(11). They further state that: \\"One of the most amazing things about Momo is that it was published in 1973. Since then, the temporal nightmare it depicts has become our reality.\\" Ende himself has said that \\"Momo is a tribute of gratitude to Italy and also a declaration of love,\\"Talk with Ende , Michiko and Fumi Koyasu, Asahi Journal, 1986 indicating that the author idealized the Italian way of life. Loy and Goodhew suggested that Ende's perspective on time coincided with his interest in Buddhism and that for example the deliberately slow character of Beppo might be regarded as a Zen master, even though Ende wrote the book long before his visits to Japan.Goodhew, Linda; and Loy, David, Momo, Dogen, and the Commodification of Time, KronoScope, Volume 2, Number 1, 2002, pp. 97-107(11).

When the book was published in the U.S. in 1985, Natalie Babbit from the Washington Post commented: \\"Is it a children's book? Not here in America.\\"Book: Momo at Donnelly/Colt Progressive Resources website Momo was republished by Puffin Press on January 19, 2009.Lost Book Archives: Momo (review by Emily Mah, January 25, 2001 Then Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbj√∏rn Jagland, in his New Year Address to the nation on January 1, 1997, referenced Ende's book and its plot: \\"People are persuaded to save time by eliminating everything not useful. One of the people so influenced cuts out his girlfriend, sells his pet, stops singing, reading and visiting friends. In this way he will supposedly become an efficient man getting something out of life. What is strange is that he is in a greater hurry than ever. The saved-up time disappears - and he never sees it again.\\" Prime Minister Jagland went on say that to many people, time has become the scarcest resource of all, contrary to their attempt at saving as much of it as possible. Adaptations Momo sculpture by Ulrike Enders located at Michael-Ende-Platz square in Hanover, Germany * Momo was made into a film of Italian/German production in 1986, in which Michael Ende himself played a small role as the narrator who encounters Professor Hora (performed by John Huston) at the beginning of the film (and at the end of the book). The role of Momo was performed by German actress and model Radost Bokel. ** * Momo (2001) is an Italian animated film based on the novel. It is directed by Enzo D'Al√≤ and features a soundtrack by Gianna Nannini, an Italian popular singer. In 2003, a 26-episode animated television series based directly on this adaptation was released, serving as an extended re-telling of the film. * The book has also been acted in radio programmes. * A German dramatized audiobook under the title Momo (Karussell/Universal Music Group 1984, directed by Anke Beckert, narrated by Harald Leipnitz, music by Frank Duval, 3 parts on LP and MC, 2 parts on CD) * There have been a number of stage adaptations, including an opera written by Ende himself and an English-language version by Andy Thackeray. * In 2015, the Royal Danish Opera commissioned composer Svitlana Azarova to write Momo and the Time Thieves. Its world premiere occurred at the Copenhagen Opera House in October, 2017.Momo and the Time Thieves - premiere 15th of October 2017 Translations The book was published the first time 1973 in Germany as Momo. Momo has been translated into various languages including Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Catalan, http://www.bgbook.dir.bg/book.php?ID=5728 Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic,http://gegnir.is:80/F/D8QKKPV92INCJK2VT17EXAGBAV4KX96U7FTN2HYV9YU4GDU8BV-36896?func=full- set-set&set;_number=032214&set;_entry=000007&format;=999 Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish, http://cobiss6.izum.si/scripts/cobiss?ukaz=DISP&id;=1004428757299912&rec;=9&sid;=1 Swedish, Turkish, Thai, Vietnamese and Sinhalese. The original English translation The Grey Gentlemen by Frances Lobb was published in 1974. A new English translation, Momo, was published in 1984. A newly translated, newly illustrated U.S. edition was released by McSweeney's in August 2013, in celebration of the book's fortieth anniversary. The McSweeney edition was scheduled for a new release in January 2017. However, some illustrations (created by Marcel Dzama) in the McSweeney release, such as Momo's appearance, do not conform to the text in the book. The Spanish translation \\"Momo, o la extra√±a historia de los ladrones del tiempo y la ni√±a que devolvi√≥ el tiempo a los hombres\\" was made by Susana Constante in 1978 for Ediciones Alfaguara: it was a great success in Spain and Latin America, having dozens of reprints since. The Persian translation was published several times (first time in 1988) by Zarrin Publishers in Tehran. At the time of publication, it enjoyed great popularity in Iran, but due to the absence of any new printings since 1992, it is now inaccessible to the Iranian children. This, along with a stop in publishing other children's books by German and other European writers, is part of an ongoing trend in publishing American and English children's fiction in Iran. In popular culture *An episode of the anime adaptation of Sailor Moon features a plot similar to the plot of the Men in Grey where the villain Jadeite steals the time of the people of Tokyo. * The story of Momo plays a role in the Korean TV series My Lovely Sam Soon, where the main character's niece chooses to not speak due to post-traumatic stress of having both her parents killed in a car accident. The lead character buys the book and reads it (by himself and also to his niece) to try to understand his love interest more. * The Korean girl group Momoland was named after this novel.

It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing a loss of ability to create new memories. It is also useful for the treatment of seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, or injection into a muscle, by spraying into the nose, or through the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours. Side effects can include a decrease in efforts to breathe, low blood pressure, and sleepiness. Tolerance to its effects and withdrawal syndrome may occur following long-term use. Paradoxical effects, such as increased activity, can occur especially in children and older people. There is evidence of risk when used during pregnancy but no evidence of harm with a single dose during breastfeeding. It belongs to the benzodiazepine class of drugs and works by increasing the activity of the GABA neurotransmitter in the brain. Midazolam was patented in 1974 and came into medical use in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Midazolam is available as a generic medication. In many countries, it is a controlled substance. Medical uses Seizures Midazolam is sometimes used for the acute management of seizures. Long-term use for the management of epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be given in the cheek or in the nose for acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle (which is not required due to its solubility in water), which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures‚Äîdue to the short half-life of midazolam‚Äîin over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14‚Äì18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures. Procedural sedation Intravenous midazolam is indicated for procedural sedation (often in combination with an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation of people who are ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine in the intensive care unit (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation. Midazolam is sometimes used in neonatal intensive care units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam should not be used for longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis, and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological complications. Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications. Midazolam is also sometimes used in newborns who are receiving mechanical ventilation, although morphine is preferred, owing to its better safety profile for this indication. Sedation using midazolam can be used to relieve anxiety and manage behaviour in children undergoing dental treatment. Agitation Midazolam, in combination with an antipsychotic drug, is indicated for the acute management of schizophrenia when it is associated with aggressive or out-of-control behaviour. End of life care In the final stages of end-of-life care, midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare. \\"[I]n their last 24 hours... 31% had low doses of medication to [control distress from agitation or restlessness]... the remaining 4% required higher doses\\" Contraindications Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or other drug- dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications. Side effects Injectable midazolam in 1 and 5 mg/ml strengths Side effects of midazolam in the elderly are listed above. People experiencing amnesia as a side effect of midazolam are generally unaware their memory is impaired, unless they had previously known it as a side effect. Long-term use of benzodiazepines has been associated with long-lasting deficits of memory, and show only partial recovery six months after stopping benzodiazepines. It is unclear whether full recovery occurs after longer periods of abstinence. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression. Paradoxical excitement occasionally occurs with benzodiazepines, including a worsening of seizures. Children and elderly individuals or those with a history of alcohol abuse and individuals with a history of aggressive behavior or anger are at increased risk of paradoxical effects. Paradoxical reactions are particularly associated with intravenous administration. After nighttime administration of midazolam, residual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions, may persist into the next day. This may impair the ability of users to drive safely and may increase the risk of falls and hip fractures. Sedation, respiratory depression and hypotension due to a reduction in systematic vascular resistance, and an increase in heart rate can occur. If intravenous midazolam is given too quickly, hypotension may occur. A \\"midazolam infusion syndrome\\" may result from high doses, and is characterised by delayed arousal hours to days after discontinuation of midazolam, and may lead to an increase in the length of ventilatory support needed. In susceptible individuals, midazolam has been known to cause a paradoxical reaction, a well-documented complication with benzodiazepines. When this occurs, the individual may experience anxiety, involuntary movements, aggressive or violent behavior, uncontrollable crying or verbalization, and other similar effects. This seems to be related to the altered state of consciousness or disinhibition produced by the drug. Paradoxical behavior is often not recalled by the patient due to the amnesia-producing properties of the drug. In extreme situations, flumazenil can be administered to inhibit or reverse the effects of midazolam. Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, have also been used for this purpose. Midazolam is known to cause respiratory depression. In healthy humans, 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam may cause respiratory depression, which is postulated to be a central nervous system (CNS) effect. When midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely. Although the incidence of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1‚Äì0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration are expected to have a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Midazolam, when taken during the third trimester of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended. Elderly Additional caution is required in the elderly, as they are more sensitive to the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls. Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal A benzodiazepine dependence occurs in about one-third of individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome in a matter of days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person's underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system. Chronic users of benzodiazepine medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam results in the development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal. Overdose A midazolam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used within an hour of the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals. Symptoms of midazolam overdose can include: * Ataxia * Dysarthria * Nystagmus * Slurred speech * Somnolence (difficulty staying awake) * Mental confusion * Hypotension * Respiratory arrest * Vasomotor collapse * Impaired motor functions ** Impaired reflexes ** Impaired coordination ** Impaired balance ** Dizziness * Coma * Death Detection in body fluids Concentrations of midazolam or its major metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may be measured in plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half-life for both the parent drug and its active metabolite, with accumulation of these two substances in the bloodstream and the appearance of adverse depressant effects. Interactions Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, clarithromycin inhibit the metabolism of midazolam, leading to a prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations. Pharmacology Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine in adults with an elimination half-life of 1.5‚Äì2.5 hours. In the elderly, as well as young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer. Midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the pharmacokinetic factors of midazolam as well as its active metabolite. However, the active metabolite of midazolam is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of biological activity of midazolam. Midazolam is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream. Midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABA receptors; midazolam does not activate GABA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABA receptors (‚Üë frequency of Cl channel opening) resulting in neural inhibition. Almost all of the properties can be explained by the actions of benzodiazepines on GABA receptors. This results in the following pharmacological properties being produced: sedation, induction of sleep, reduction in anxiety, anterograde amnesia, muscle relaxation and anticonvulsant effects. History Midazolam is among about 35 benzodiazepines currently used medically, and was synthesized in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, it was found to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility. In 2018 it was revealed the CIA considered using Midazolam as a \\"truth serum\\" on terrorist suspects in project \\"Medication\\". Society and culture Cost Midazolam is available as a generic medication. Availability Midazolam is available in the United States as a syrup or as an injectable solution. Dormicum brand midazolam is marketed by Roche as white, oval, 7.5-mg tablets in boxes of two or three blister strips of 10 tablets, and as blue, oval, 15-mg tablets in boxes of two (Dormonid 3x) blister strips of 10 tablets. The tablets are imprinted with \\"Roche\\" on one side and the dose of the tablet on the other side. Dormicum is also available as 1-, 3-, and 10-ml ampoules at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Another manufacturer, Novell Pharmaceutical Laboratories, makes it available as Miloz in 3- and 5-ml ampoules. Midazolam is the only water-soluble benzodiazepine available. Another maker is Roxane Laboratories; the product in an oral solution, Midazolam HCl Syrup, 2 mg/ml clear, in a red to purplish-red syrup, cherry in flavor. It becomes soluble when the injectable solution is buffered to a pH of 2.9‚Äì3.7. Midazolam is also available in liquid form. It can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, intrathecally, intranasally, buccally, or orally. Legal status In the Netherlands, midazolam is a List II drug of the Opium Law. Midazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In the United Kingdom, midazolam is a Schedule 3/Class C controlled drug. In the United States, midazolam (DEA number 2884) is on the Schedule IV list of the Controlled Substances Act as a non-narcotic agent with low potential for abuse. Marketing authorization In 2011, the European Medicines Agency granted a marketing authorisation for a buccal application form of midazolam, sold under the trade name Buccolam. Buccolam was approved for the treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in people from three months to less than 18 years of age. This was the first application of a paediatric-use marketing authorisation.  Use in executions  Oklahoma State Penitentiary, the site of the state of Oklahoma's execution chamber The drug has been introduced for use in executions by lethal injection in certain jurisdictions in the United States in combination with other drugs. It was introduced to replace pentobarbital after the latter's manufacturer disallowed that drug's use for executions. Midazolam acts as a sedative to render the condemned prisoner unconscious, at which time the vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered, stopping the prisoner's breathing and heart, respectively. Midazolam has been used as part of a three-drug cocktail, with vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride in Florida and Oklahoma prisons. Midazolam has also been used along with hydromorphone in a two-drug protocol in Ohio and Arizona. The usage of midazolam in executions became controversial after condemned inmate Clayton Lockett apparently regained consciousness and started speaking midway through his 2014 execution when the state of Oklahoma attempted to execute him with an untested three-drug lethal injection cocktail using 100 mg of midazolam. Prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead of a heart attack 40 minutes after the execution began. An observing doctor stated that Lockett's vein had ruptured. It is not clear which drug or drugs caused his death or what quantities of vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride were released before the execution was cancelled. =Notable incidents= Florida used midazolam to execute William Happ in October 2013. Ohio used midazolam in the execution of Dennis McGuire in January 2014; it took McGuire 24 minutes to die after the procedure started, and he gasped and appeared to be choking during that time, leading to questions about the dosing and timing of the drug administration, as well as the choice of drugs. The execution of Ronald Bert Smith in Alabama on December 8, 2016 \\"went awry soon after (midazolam) was administered\\" again putting the effectiveness of the drug in question. In October 2016, the U.S. state of Ohio announced that it would resume executions in January 2017, using the midazolam-vecuronium bromide-potassium chloride cocktail, but this was blocked by a Federal judge. On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire. Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017. On April 24, 2017, Arkansas carried out a double-execution of Jack Jones, 52, and Marcel Williams, 46. The state of Arkansas attempted to execute eight people before its supply of midazolam expired on April 30, 2017. Two of them were granted a stay of execution, and another, Ledell T. Lee, 51, was executed on April 20, 2017. =Legal challenges= In Glossip v. Gross, attorneys for three Oklahoma inmates argued that midazolam could not achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery, meaning severe pain and suffering was likely. They argued that midazolam was cruel and unusual punishment and thus contrary to the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled they failed to prove that midazolam was cruel and unusual when compared to known, available alternatives. The State of Nevada is also known to use midazolam in execution procedures. In July 2018, one of the manufacturers accused state officials of obtaining the medication under false pretenses. This incident was the first time a drug company successfully, though temporarily, halted an execution. A previous attempt in 2017 to halt an execution in the state of Arizona by another drug manufacturer was not successful.

Barnett calls his theory the liberal conception of justice, emphasizing the relationship between legal libertarianism and classical liberalism. Barnett argues that private adjudication and enforcement of law, with market forces eliminating inefficiencies and inequities, is the only legal system that can provide adequate solutions to the problems of interest, power, and knowledge. Barnett uses the term \\"polycentric constitutional order\\" for anarcho-capitalismHoppe, Hans-Hermann, Anarcho-Capitalism: An Annotated Bibliography in his argument in favor of this philosophy. Problems in human interaction Barnett's argument for the liberal conception focuses on three problems of human interaction: * the problem of knowledge‚Äîeach individual has unique knowledge about his or her own interests and situation and about how resources can best be used. * the problem of interest‚Äîeach individual has self-interests which can be coordinated through the creation of decentralized property rights. * the problem of power‚Äîgiven that those with the power to impose punishments will be partial to their own interests, the power to punish or to use force to compel restitution is likely to be abused. Barnett argues that each of these problems must be solved in order for individuals to be able to pursue their happiness under conditions of social peace. Liberal conception of justice Barnett argues that these the problems of knowledge, interest, and power can best be solved by a form of social organization that respects the liberal conception of justice. The liberal conception has five elements: # Property rights, defined as rights to acquire, possess, use, and dispose of scarce physical resources. # The right to acquire property through first possession. # The right of freedom of contract, which specifies that a rightholder's consent is both necessary (freedom from contract) and sufficient (freedom to contract) to transfer alienable property rights. # The right of restitution, which requires that one who violates the rights of others must compensate the victim. # The right of self-defense. Barnett argues that the liberal conception of justice can best be realized by a polycentric constitutional order, which substitutes private police and dispute resolution mechanisms instead of the state ones.

S means \\"Stereo\\", L means \\"Player\\". Originally released as a high fidelity consumer record player, it quickly became adopted among radio and disco club disc jockeys, thanks to the direct drive, high torque motor design, making it initially suitable for pushbutton cueing and starting of tracks on radio and in dance clubs. It is still extremely popular with audiophiles. When the use of slip-mats for cueing and beat-mixing (and scratching) became popular in hip hop music, the quartz-controlled high torque motor system enabled records to be mixed with consistency and accuracy. A primary design goal was for hi- fidelity, but having good build quality, control over wow and flutter, and minimized resonance made the equipment particularly suitable for use in nightclubs and other public-address applications. Since its release in 1978, SL-1200MK2 and its successors were the most common turntable for DJing and scratching. Producers, DJs and MCs refer to the Technics turntable as the \\"Tech 12s\\", \\"the 1s and 2s\\" and the \\"Wheels of Steel\\". 1200s are commonly used in recording studios and for non-electronic live music performance. More than 3 million units were sold. It is widely regarded as one of the most durable and reliable turntables ever produced. Many 1970s units are still in heavy use. In the autumn of 2010, Panasonic announced that the series was to be discontinued.Dead spin: Panasonic discontinues Technics analog turntables - Oct 2010 However, at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, Panasonic announced that they would return in two models named \\"Grand Class\\": one a limited run of 1200 globally (1200GAE), and the other a consumer product (1200G). A lighter and less expensive 1200GR model was announced. At the London Science Museum, a Technics SL-1210 is on displayTechnics SL-1200 / Technics SL-1210 Shaped Our World - May 2010 as one of the pieces of technology that have \\"shaped the world we live in\\".Pair of quartz synthesiser direct-drive turntables, 1999 - 1999 Features SL-1200 features include: * Magnetic (no wear), direct drive (low slip) mechanism. * High torque (1.5 kgf¬∑cm or 0.15 N¬∑m), which means the platter spins at the desired speed almost immediately (0.7 seconds to reach 33 ¬π‚ÅÑ‚ÇÉ RPM from standstill), and rapidly reacquires the desired speed, without \\"overshooting\\", if the platter is dragged or nudged. This aids beatmatching. * High torque (3.3 kgf¬∑cm for SL-1200G & SL-1200GAE) * High torque (2.2 kgf¬∑cm for SL-1200GR) * High torque (1.8 kgf¬∑cm for SL-1200MK7) * Low wow and flutter (0.01%), implying that the platter stays within 1/100 of 1% of the desired speed. * Heavy base (2.5 kg), and increased isolation of platter from base, reduced the likelihood of feedback or stylus jumping. * Variable pitch control, allowing the rotational speed to be adjusted from -8% to +8% (for the purpose of beatmatching). Option to select -16% to +16% added (M5G/MK5G/GLD, GAE/G/GR & MK7). * High reliability: many examples of SL-1200s lasting well over 15 years of heavy use and withstanding physical shock without functional impairment. * S-shaped tone arm: No longer popular on high end hi-fi turntables. * Dimensions MK1: 45.3 cm (w) x 36.6 cm (d) x 18 cm (h) * Dimensions MK2: 45.3 cm (w) x 36 cm (d) x 16.2 cm (h) * Weight MK2: 11 kg (net, unboxed without lid) * Weight G/GAE: 18 kg * Weight GR: 11.5 kg * Weight MK7: 9.6 kg * Voltage: 220 V / 110 V (selectable) * Pitch Control: +/- 8% or +/- 16% * Starting Time (MK2): 0.7s * Rotation Speeds: 33-1/3 & 45 rpm * Rotation Speeds: 33-1/3, 45 rpm & 78rpm (MK4 MK7, G & GR) History The SL-1200 was the most influential turntable.Six Machines That Changed The Music World, Wired, May 2002 It was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972.Brian Coleman, The Technics 1200 ‚Äî Hammer Of The Gods, Medium It was adopted by New York City hip hop DJs in the 1970s. As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed scratching techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. Legacy models Original model The original SL-1200 from 1972 The Technics EPA-120 tonearm was standard equipment on the original SL-1200 and was significantly different than the tonearm introduced with the MK2 and subsequent models. =SL-1200= The SL-1200 was introduced in 1972 as an evolution to the popular SL-1100. It was dubbed \\"The Middle Class Player System\\". It was delivered in two different versions: The SL-1200 came with a tonearm section. The SL-120 came without a tonearm section. An SME tonearm was the usual choice for the audiophile. MK2 models The SL-1200 Mark 2 was introduced in 1979 as an update to the SL-1200. It represented a culmination of Technics Turntable Innovations. It was dubbed as \\"The Middle Class Quartz Direct Drive\\". It soon found its way into discos as well as radio stations for airplay because of its vibration damping ability and resistance to feedback, and eventually it became popular with pioneering hip-hop DJs. Model numbers indicated colour: the 1200 (silver) and 1210 (matte black). This was the same in the US and Japan initially, however later the 1200 was available in both silver and matte black finishes. Since 1997, The Mk2 had the pitch slide potentiometer improved in order to remove the quartz lock conflict when beatmatching near the 0% mark. in order to do this, the SFDZ122N11-1 part number was replaced with an improved SFDZ122N11-2 part which had a +/- 0.5mm quartz travel lock, much shorter than previous versions. This meant that the null point on the centre voltage tap was slightly bigger thus removing the quartz lock conflict. The difference can be seen in the following video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_rr01ssq8o =SL-1200MK2= Released in summer of 1978. this model came in both silver and matte black. The matte black version was available for a limited time in the US market in a 2 pack SL-1200MK2PK . Technics improved the motor and shock resistance and changed the rotary pitch control to a slider style. This became the base model and is the oldest whose production continued until 2010. The older version of this model that was sold in the 1970s until around 1983 has a large plate where the RCA and ground wires enter the unit, while the newer version has a smaller hole in the rubber where the RCA and ground enter. International versions of the SL-1200MK2 included switches for line voltage and frequency beneath the platter. =SL-1210MK2= This model came in satin black metallic finish and is nearly the same in function as the SL-1200MK2, although some of the circuitry inside is updated to use fewer types of pots and resistors.SL-1200mk2 and SL-1210mk2 service manuals The Technics 1210 series also had a switch to change between voltages on the underside of the platter. It was unavailable from official Panasonic dealers in the United States. =SL-1200MK2PK= This model has a matte black finish, and was only available in the United States. MK3 models =SL-1200MK3= Released in 1989, has a matte black finish like the MK2, gold RCA plugs, and a small gold-foil Technics label on the back. It was destined only for the Japanese market. =SL-1200MK3D= Japan only, factory gold RCA cables, black or silver finish. Pitch reset button. =SL-1200M3D= Released in 1997, has a silver finish like the MK2 (beside silver finish, there are copies with \\"champagneish\\" color), a detached dust cover (no hinges), a recessed power switch to prevent DJs from accidentally turning the deck off during use, and no self-locking detent (\\"click\\") at the zero point of the pitch adjustment slider, allowing more precise control of pitch near that point. It has a reset button that sets the pitch adjustment to 0, regardless of the actual position of the pitch adjustment slider. In addition the M3D series has unique details: the brand and model label is printed in a single line instead of two; and the stroboscopic light is red with a slightly orange tone. This model also introduced a slot near the counterweight allowing for storage of a second headshell. =SL-1210M3D= This model is the same as the SL-1200M3D except with a matte black finish like the MK2 and a voltage switch. MK4 models =SL-1200MK4= The SL-1200 Mark 4 was introduced in 1996. It was an update to the SL-1200MK2. It was available only in Japan / Southeast Asia markets, and priced at around $650. It has a matte black finish. This model is aimed at the hi-end audiophile market rather than DJs. It is the last model made with the detent (\\"click\\") in the neutral position (+/- 0%) of the pitch adjustment slider. In addition to the existing 33 RPM and 45 RPM buttons, the MK4 added a 78 RPM button. It is designed to be used with regular removable RCA cables (along with a removable ground/earth cable) rather than having hard wired RCA cables like all other 1200/1210 models. The tonearm was different from those in the previous models as it was made from titanium. Technics SL-1200 MK5 playing a record MK5 models =SL-1200MK5= Released on 1 November 2000, this has a silver finish like the MK2, increases the range of anti-skate settings from 0‚Äì3 grams-force (0‚Äì30 mN) to 0‚Äì6 grams-force (0‚Äì60 mN). It has a white LED target light (previous versions only had an incandescent bulb). Current MK5 models have a removable lid with magnets as opposed to the MK2 and MK3 removable hinged lid. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market. The MK5 is the last 1200 model to retain an analog pitch control. =SL-1210MK5= This has a matte black finish like the MK2, and is exactly the same as the SL-1200MK5, aside from the voltage switch, like the other decks in the 1210 series. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market. =SL-1200MK5G= This is similar to the SL-1210M5G. =SL-1210M5G= Released on 1 November 2002, this has a glossy black finish with silver speckles. It was a special 30th-anniversary edition. It was initially launched in Japan only (together with the MK5) but then became internationally available. It switches between ¬±8% and ¬±16% ranges for pitch adjustment, and the pitch control is digital which will be the standard for all 1200 models from this point on. It also features blue target lights and blue pitch-number illumination. The brake strength potentiometer, although still located beneath platter, can now be adjusted, unlike previous models, using a small plastic knob. Minor improvements over Mk2, Mk3, Mk4, & 1200LTD include improved tonearm mounting and oxygen-free copper wire, improved vibration damping in the body, improvements to pitch control accuracy and better LEDs. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market. MK6 models * SL-1200MK6-K & SL-1200MK6-S (released in February 2008 in Japan) with minor improvements including improved tonearm mounting and oxygen-free copper wire, improved vibration damping in the body, improvements to the pitch control accuracy and better LEDs. -S model has a silver finish like the MK2. * SL-1200MK6K1 Released on 12 December 2007 (in Japan) as a special 35th- anniversary Limited edition of 1200 units . It consisted of a standard black MK6 packaged up with a booklet and gold record. Special models These were limited edition versions, with 24 karat gold plated metal parts including tonearm and buttons. Many \\"non-official\\" special models of the SL-1200 and SL-1210 appeared over the years, mainly given away as prizes for turntablism, most notably the DMC World Championship, who awarded the winner a pair of 24K gold plated Technics turntables. Due to the customisation trend that has grown in the DJ community, many local events or competitions gave away custom coloured or finished units. =SL-1200LTD= The SL-1200 Limited Edition was introduced in 1995 commemorating two million units in sales. Only 5,000 units were made.https://www.technics.com/global/sl1200/heritage/#product5 Like the MK3D, it has a pitch reset button, but differs in that it also has a self- locking detent at the zero position of pitch adjustment. This model has a piano black gloss finish and gold-plated hardware. It was priced at about US$1200. =SL-1200GLD= Released in 2004, another limited edition model, with only 3,000 units manufactured. 500 released in Japan with the rest split between the US and International markets. It is based on the MK5G model, with blue (instead of the regular white) target lights, a piano black gloss finish, and gold-plated hardware. It was \\"created to commemorate the 3 Million turntables sold by technics in the last 30 years\\". Current models Grand Class SL-1200 Series Development of a completely rebuilt SL-1200 from the ground up with the intent to create a new system for Hi-Fi use and to redefine the direct-drive turntable reference. =SL-1210GAE= On 28 May 2020, Technics hosted an online launch event to reveal the SL-1210GAE as an alternative for the cancelled High End Munchen 2020 event at which they initially planned to reveal it. It is their 55th Anniversary Edition turntable - A limited edition of 1,000 units. Each unit has a plaque on it with its production number engraved in it. The SL-1210GAE is the black counterpart of the SL-1200GAE and is the same in every aspect except the color and the additional feature to turn off the strobe light. It had an approximate MSRP price of ‚Ç¨4,499 =SL-1200G= A Technics SL-1200G turntable with the platter removed reveals the top of the newly designed coreless direct drive motor assembly. In contrast to older models, the platter has no magnet ring on the backside, but is bolted directly onto the motor assembly instead, using three flathead bolts. Announced in January 2016 CES in Las Vegas, released in October 2016, SL-1200 Grand Class, an aluminum bound turntable with a high‚Äìdamping matte magnesium tonearm, a \\"three‚Äìlayer\\" turntable system, complete with a microprocessor and the use of a newly developed coreless twin- rotor direct-drive motor with no iron core with rotary positing sensors to eliminate cogging, as well as providing 78 rpm speed compatibility. =SL-1200GAE= Announced in January 2016 CES in Las Vegas, released in April 2016, SL-1200 Grand Class 50th Anniversary Edition - A Limited edition of 1,200 units. Same as above, but high polish tonearm tube finish and different viscous material in the turntable feet. Both the G and GAE had an approximate MSRP price of ¬£3,100 / ‚Ç¨3,499 / $4,000. =SL-1200GR= Announced in January 2017 CES, the GR model is a stripped-down budget version of the G cutting the price tag more than half at an approximate MSRP of ¬£1,299 / $1,700 USD. It differs in body construction that it uses a more traditional cast aluminium design similar to the older decks and a one-piece cast platter which brings an overall weight difference between the G/GAE. The G/GAE and GR both use what are essentially the same 9-pole motor. Whereas the G has twin rotors, the GR has a single rotor, giving it less torque. The GR differs from the G in its use of a feedback generator coil system (as used in the original SL1200) instead of an optical encoder. =SL-1210GR= This is the same as the SL-1200GR except with a matte black finish. MK7 models The MK7 models were launched as the first new Technics standard DJ turntable in approximately nine years. Unlike its audiophile counterparts, the MK7 models are built in Malaysia as opposed to Japan. The MK7, along with the Grand Class models, no longer have \\"QUARTZ\\" printed on the plinth nor dust cover. =SL-1200MK7= Announced in January 2019 CES, the new model inherits the traditional design of the same series in all black and maintains the same operating ease, reliability and durability, while newly adding a coreless direct drive motor and other sound-enhancing technologies. It also features new DJ play functions and features, such as reverse playback, adjustable starting torque and brake speed, detachable terminals for power cable and phono cables (which was previously only available on the MK4 model), an option to select the strobe light indicator from red to blue (the 33/45 lights, 0-pitch reset light and the X2 pitch range light also change to match the color selected), and a new push-type structure for the white LED stylus illuminator. =SL-1210MK7= This is the same as the SL-1200MK7, but intended for the European market. =SL-1210MK7R= Available from September 2020 globally, the SL-1210MK7R is a limited edition version of the SL-1210MK7 produced in collaboration with the Red Bull BC One international breakdancing competition. The SL-1210MK7R comes in Red Bull livery with red headshell, gold-coloured tone arm and decals. Design strengths Two SL-1200M3Ds set up for DJ battle, or scratching, mixing. An Allen & Heath‚Ñ¢ 4-Channel with Effects Mixer sits between the two turntables, allowing shorter travel during battles, or competitions. The SL-1200 series was developed as a special project by Technics parent company Matsushita in an attempt to solve problems related to turntable design. The task included minimizing acoustic feedback, unwanted resonances, wow and flutter and speed errors. This was achieved by designing a heavy plinth (base) made of a non-resonant composite sandwiched between a cast alloy top plate and a solid rubber base. In addition, the adjustable rubber- damped feet insulated against acoustic feedback, which can be a serious problem when operating a turntable in close proximity to loudspeakers (a common situation for DJs). The drive system designed by Matsushita is direct- drive rather than the more commonly found belt-drive type, a less expensive design. The direct-drive design, which was developed to reduce wow and flutter, produces a very quiet turntable that, for a direct-drive turntable, has minimal motor and bearing noise, (although the bearing rumble does tend to become characteristic in well-used turntables). This was partially achieved through the fact that the SL1210/1200 made the platter a part of the motor mechanism. On the underside of the platter a large magnet is placed over the spindle, surrounding the coils and forming the motor drive, thus eliminating loss through power transfer. The SL-1200 utilizes a Frequency Generator Servo Control Quartz Lock system that is claimed to produce the most accurate and consistent speed possible. The system is immune to static and dynamic stylus drag which otherwise cause unwanted speed variances that change the pitch and tempo of the music.SL1200MK2 Service Manual. Specifications. Speed Change Due To Load Torque: 0% within 1 kg-cm Termination On 1 November 2010, Panasonic made the following statement on the DMC World DJ Championships home page. :Panasonic reactive statement - Production of analogue turntables has ceased :Panasonic has confirmed that it ceased the production of its Technics- branded analogue turntables this autumn. :After more than 35 years as a leading manufacturer of analogue turntables, Panasonic has regretfully taken the decision to leave this market. However, Panasonic will continue to sell headphones under the Technics brand. :We are sure that retailers and consumers will understand that our product range has to reflect the accelerating transformation of the entire audio market from analogue to digital. :In addition, the number of component suppliers serving the analogue market has dwindled in recent years and we brought forward the decision to leave the market rather than risk being unable to fulfil future orders because of a lack of parts. :Panasonic employees who have been working on the analogue turntable range have been redeployed elsewhere within Panasonic - many of them continuing to work in Panasonic's Audio Video Business Unit. Re-launch petition Due to the increasing popularity of vinyl by DJs, a petition has been underway (and a petition page on Facebook.) for the re-launch of the Technics SL1200/SL1210 series turntables. As of September 2015 the petition had 27,000 supporters, while 35,000 is the target Panasonic requested. On January 5, 2016 Technics agreed to relaunch both the SL-1200G and the SL-1200GAE Resuming production At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Panasonic announced it would be resuming production with a new line of turntables, beginning with the Limited Edition SL-1200GAE At the 2019 Consumer Electronics Show, Panasonic confirmed future production of a new turntable respectively the SL-1200 Mk7 in matte black, adding new features, fixing known issues with previous models, and all new lighter construction of aluminum and fiber glass.

It is popular with tourists, in particular for the scenery and the ruined Tintern Abbey. Modern Tintern has been formed through the coalescence of two historic villages; Tintern Parva, forming the northern end of the village, and Chapel Hill, which forms the southern end. The village is designated as a Conservation Area.Adopted Unitary Development Plan archive accessed 5 April 2018 History Early history A ford across the navigable and tidal River Wye was in use in Roman times, close to the site of the abbey. After the Romans withdrew from Wales, the kingdom of Gwent emerged, and, according to tradition, in the 6th century one of their kings, Tewdrig, came out of retirement as a Tintern hermit to defeat the invading Saxons in battle, perhaps at a site known today as Pont y Saison (Bridge of the Saxons) in the Angiddy Valley.History page Tintern.org, accessed 5 April 2018 The name Tintern may derive from the Welsh din + d/teyrn, meaning \\"rocks of the king\\".E. T. Davies, A History of the Parish of Mathern, 1990 Tintern village c. 1914 The abbey Tintern Abbey was founded beside the river by Walter de Clare on 9 May 1131, during the reign of King Henry I. It was the second Cistercian foundation in Britain, and its monks came from a daughter house of C√Æteaux in France. Tintern Abbey, interior The present-day remains at Tintern are a mixture of building works covering several centuries. Between 1270 and 1301 the abbey was rebuilt, and when it was completed around four hundred monks lived in the complex. The abbey's land was divided into agricultural units or granges, and local people provided farm labour and served the abbey and its many visitors. For 400 years, it dominated the economy of its surrounding area. During some of this period the area was contested between the Welsh and English, the closest battle being won in 1404 by Owain Glynd≈µr, at Craig y Dorth near Monmouth. The area also had to contend with the Black Death, and it is suspected that the neighbouring village of Penterry disappeared at that time. The abbey remained in operation until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536. Brass, iron and wire works Though it has been suggested that the monks or lay brethren of Tintern Abbey exploited the woodlands and river power for operating iron forges, evidence of this is lacking. Industrial activity began in 1568 when the newly established Company of Mineral and Battery Works built a wireworks. It is possible that brass was made,Photo of plaque commemorating brass works at geograph.org.uk, accessed 5 April 2018 but the works mainly made iron wire. This was used for a wide variety of industries with essential goods: cards for the woollen industry, nails, pins, knitting needles and fish hooks. The site was convenient, because the Wye offered transportation, the Angiddy stream provided water power, trees in nearby woods were used for charcoal fuel, and the locality provided a ready supply of minerals. The company began letting their works. Farmers of the works in the 17th century included Sir Basil Brooke, Thomas Foley, the important ironmaster and his son Thomas Foley.W. Rees, Industry Before the Industrial Revolution A blast furnace and forges were built in the valley in the 17th century and operated with the wireworks until the end of the 19th century.P. Riden, A gazetteer of charcoal-fired blast furnaces (Merton Priory Press, Cardiff 1993), pp. 48-51 River Wye and Tintern Parva For 300 years, the numerous works and forges along the Angidy Valley dominated the village and surrounding communities. A branch from the Wye Valley Railway to the Lower Wireworks by way of a bridge (the 'Wireworks Bridge') was completed in 1875, but too late to stop them going out of business. In 1878 a new company leased the site to manufacture tinplate although by 1895 it was reported as closed and only some ruins, associated ponds, leats and culverts are now visible. The Angidy Trail See p.5, wyevalleyaonb.org.uk The bridge was used in the early 20th century as a horse- drawn tramway and now carries a tourist footpath to the opposite bank.Alan Crow, Bridges on the River Wye, 1995, The tourist industry By the late 18th century, tourism had started in the Wye Valley, with many visitors travelling on the river to see the abbey and other \\"picturesque\\" sites in the area. William Wordsworth stayed in the village in 1798 and wrote Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey.

Areas of interest St Mary the Virgin on Chapel Hill St Mary the Virgin on Chapel Hill The ruins of St. Mary's Church can also be seen on a hill to the west of the abbey. Medieval in origin, the church was virtually rebuilt in 1866-68 by John Prichard. While much of the church is still clearly visible today, a fire in 1977 left the building in ruins. The churchyard is now maintained by volunteers.

Other major sizeable cities in Middle Tennessee include Clarksville and Murfreesboro. According to custom, Middle Tennessee consists of that portion of the state east of the Tennessee River's western crossing of the state (in which it flows northward back into Tennessee after having flowed through northern Alabama) and west of the dividing line between the Eastern and Central time zones. Exceptions to this rule are that Hardin County, which is located on both sides of the Tennessee River, is considered to be entirely in West Tennessee and that Bledsoe, Cumberland, and Marion counties are generally considered to be in East Tennessee despite being in the Central Time Zone. The Official Tourism Website of Tennessee has a definition of the eastern border slightly different from the legal definition.Official Tourism Website of Tennessee The website includes Cumberland County in Middle Tennessee, while excluding Grundy and Sequatchie counties. Middle Tennessee is composed predominantly of the Nashville Basin and the Highland Rim, although the western portion of the Cumberland Plateau also extends into Middle Tennessee.Middle School Geography , Tennessee History for Kids, accessed August 3, 2010 It is characterized by rolling hills and fertile stream valleys. Counties Under the most common definition, there are 41 counties in Middle Tennessee: *Bedford *Cannon *Cheatham *Clay *Coffee *Davidson *DeKalb *Dickson *Fentress *Franklin *Giles *Grundy *Hickman *Houston *Humphreys *Jackson *Lawrence *Lewis *Lincoln *Macon *Marshall *Maury *Montgomery *Moore *Overton *Perry *Pickett *Putnam *Robertson *Rutherford *Sequatchie *Smith *Stewart *Sumner *Trousdale *Van Buren *Warren *Wayne *White *Williamson *Wilson Education Middle Tennessee has an abundance of institutions of higher learning‚Äîmost notably Vanderbilt, Belmont, Lipscomb, and Tennessee State universities in Nashville and Tennessee Tech University in Cookeville. Other prominent universities are Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, the University of the South in Sewanee, Cumberland University in Lebanon, and Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, which is the state's second-largest institution of higher learning, just behind the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. Legal structure Unlike the geographic designations of regions of most U.S. states, the term Middle Tennessee has legal as well as socioeconomic meaning.Tennessee Department of State, A History of Tennessee, Tennessee Blue Book, 2005-2006. Middle Tennessee, West Tennessee, and East Tennessee are the state's three Grand Divisions. According to the Tennessee State Constitution, no more than two of the state supreme court's five justices can come from any one Grand Division. The Supreme Court rotates meeting in courthouses in each of the three divisions. The Supreme Court building for Middle Tennessee is in Nashville. A similar rule applies to certain other commissions and boards, in order to prevent a geographic bias.Tennessee State Constitution Demography Middle Tennessee is the largest in area and least densely populated of the three Grand Divisions. At the 2000 census it had 2,069,976 inhabitants living in its 41 counties, which have a combined land area of 17,009.41 square miles (44,054.17 km¬≤). Its population was 36.38 percent of the state's total, and its land area is 41.27 percent of the state's land area. Its population density was 121.696 inhabitants per square mile (46.987/km¬≤) at the census. Health care Climate The weather in Nashville is a decent mix of extremes. Plenty of sunshine in the summer, and crisp, cold air throughout the winter.

Mail is an email service launched on October 8, 1997 by the American company Yahoo!, now a subsidiary of Verizon. It offers four different email plans: three for personal use (Basic, Plus, and Ad Free) and another for businesses. As of January 2020, Yahoo! Mail had 225 million users. Users are able to access and manage their mailboxes using webmail interface, accessible using a standard web browser. Some accounts also supported the use of standard mail protocols (POP3 and SMTP). Since 2015, users can also connect non-Yahoo e-mail accounts to the webmail client. For many years, users were able to open accounts using either @yahoo.com or \\"@ymail.com\\", or a national domain (@yahoo.fr in France, @yahoo.co.uk in the United Kingdom,@yahoo.it in Italy, etc.). Currently, Yahoo! only allows users to register @yahoo.com accounts.https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN2153.html?redirect=true History 1997‚Äì2002 Yahoo! webmail interface as it appeared in 2001 Yahoo! made a deal with the online communications company Four11 for co-branded white pages. Marvin Gavin, who worked at Four11 as the director of international business development, said \\"We always had a bias about being acquired by Yahoo. They were more entrepreneurial than Microsoft. We had a great cultural fit ‚Äì it made a lot of sense.\\" In the end, Yahoo! acquired Four11 for $96 million. The purpose behind acquiring Four11 was the company's RocketMail webmail service, which launched in 1997. Yahoo! announced the acquisition on October 8, 1997, close to the time that Yahoo! Mail was launched. Yahoo! chose acquisition rather than internal platform development, because, as Healy said, \\"Hotmail was growing at thousands and thousands users per week. We did an analysis. For us to build, it would have taken four to six months, and by then, so many users would have taken an email account. The speed of the market was critical.\\" The transition to Yahoo! Mail was not easy for many Rocketmail users. On March 21, 2002, Yahoo! eliminated free software client access and introduced the $29.99 per year Mail Forwarding Service. Mary Osako, a Yahoo! Spokeswoman, told CNET, \\"For-pay services on Yahoo!, originally launched in February 1999, have experienced great acceptance from our base of active registered users, and we expect this adoption to continue to grow.\\" 2002‚Äì2010 Yahoo! Mail logo from 2002 During 2002, the Yahoo! network was gradually redesigned. On July 2, the company website was changed, and it was announced that Yahoo! Mail and other services would also be redesigned. Along with this new design, new features were to be implemented, including drop-down menus in DHTML, different category tabs, and a new user-customizable color scheme. Yahoo! Network Services senior vice president Geoff Ralston stated that Yahoo! Messenger chat integration in the Yahoo! Mail webmail interface, in beta in 2007 On July 9, 2004, Yahoo! acquired Oddpost, a webmail service which simulated a desktop email client. Oddpost had features such as drag-and- drop support, right-click menus, RSS feeds, a preview pane, and increased speed using email caching to shorten response time. Many of the features were incorporated into an updated Yahoo! Mail service. =Competition= On April 1, 2004, Google announced its Gmail service with 1 GB of storage, however Gmail's invitation-only accounts kept the other webmail services at the forefront. Most major webmail providers, including Yahoo! Mail, increased their mailbox storage in response. Yahoo! first announced 100 MB of storage for basic accounts and 2 GB of storage for premium users. However, soon Yahoo! Mail increased its free storage quota to 1 GB, before eventually allowing unlimited storage. Yahoo! Mail had free unlimited storage from March 27, 2007, until October 8, 2013. 2011‚Äìpresent Yahoo! Mail logo from 2009 Screenshot of the 2011 version of Yahoo! Mail On September 17, 2010, Yahoo! showed off a new Mail program to reporters. Codenamed \\"Minty\\", the 2011 release was announced on September 16, 2010. It included a new interface, enhanced performance, improved Facebook and Twitter integration, the ability to watch YouTube videos straight from email, and improved search. Public beta began on October 26, 2010. In May 2011, the new Yahoo! Mail became the default interface. As the new interface became mandatory for users, some users of Yahoo! Mail reported slow typing speeds, contradicting Yahoo's claims of faster performance. Yahoo! offered no resolution to the problem . Users also missed the ability to paste textual email addresses into the sender box. The new version disabled the use of the \\"secondary\\" addresses provided in the previous version. The new interface overrode the browser's right mouse button (making functions such as opening mails in new tab windows unavailable). In 2013, Yahoo redesigned the site and removed several features, such as simultaneously opening multiple emails in tabs, sorting by sender name, and dragging mails to folders. The new email interface was geared to give an improved user-experience for mobile devices, but was criticized for having an inferior desktop interface. Many users objected to the unannounced nature of the changes through an online post asking Yahoo to bring back mail tabs with one hundred thousand voting and nearly ten thousand commenting. The redesign produced a problem that caused an unknown number of users to lose access to their accounts for several weeks. In December 2013, Yahoo Mail suffered a major outage where approximately one million users, one percent of the site's total users, could not access their emails for several days. Mayer publicly apologized to the site's users. Yahoo! Mail China officially announced its shutdown on April 18, 2013. Users were warned that all emails, contacts, and account settings would be inaccessible, unless users migrated to the American version of Yahoo! Mail. Individuals who made China Yahoo! Mail accounts during the Alibaba takeover were required to create new accounts under new usernames. In January 2014, an undisclosed number of usernames and passwords were released to hackers, following a security breach that Yahoo believed had occurred through a third-party website. Yahoo contacted affected users and requested that passwords be changed. In October 2015, Yahoo updated the mail service with a \\"more subtle\\" redesign, as well as improved mobile features. The same release introduced the Yahoo Account Key, a smartphone-based replacement for password logins. In 2017, Yahoo again redesigned the web interface with a \\"more minimal\\" look, and introduced the option to customize it with different color themes and layouts. In 2020, Yahoo added a feature to view NFL matches.  User interface  As many as three web interfaces were available at any given time. The traditional \\"Yahoo! Mail Classic\\" preserved the availability of their original 1997 interface until July 2013 in North America. A 2005 version included a new Ajax interface, drag-and-drop, improved search, keyboard shortcuts, address auto-completion, and tabs. However, other features were removed, such as column widths and one click delete-move-to- next. In October 2010, Yahoo! released a beta version of Yahoo! Mail, which included improvements to performance, search, and Facebook integration. In May 2011, this became the default interface. Their current Webmail interface was introduced in 2017. Spam policy Yahoo! Mail is often used by spammers to provide a \\"remove me\\" email address. Often, these addresses are used to verify the recipient's address, thus opening the door for more spam. Yahoo! does not tolerate this practice and terminates accounts connected with spam-related activities without warning, causing spammers to lose access to any other Yahoo! services connected with their ID under the Terms of Service. Additionally, Yahoo! stresses that its servers are based in California and any spam-related activity which uses its servers could potentially violate that state's anti-spam laws. In February 2006, Yahoo! announced its decision (along with AOL) to give some organizations the option to \\"certify\\" mail by paying up to one cent for each outgoing message, allowing the mail in question to bypass inbound spam filters. In April 2011, Yahoo! Mail began rejecting spam reports, which involved sending a copy of the spam with full headers by email to Yahoo's abuse department, offering the use of a form instead. However, the requirement to use a form is prohibited by several Internet RFCs, and the availability of abuse at example.com (in this case abuse at yahoo.com) is required by the Invariants clause of RFC 2142, because the domain has a mail server and an MX record. Yahoo's claim was that its \\"standard\\" was better than the Internet standards referred to. This is the only working form through which users can report spam or misuse of the Yahoo! email service. Filters In order to prevent abuse, in 2002 Yahoo! Mail activated filters which changed certain words (that could trigger unwanted JavaScript events) and word fragments into other words. \\"mocha\\" was changed to \\"espresso\\", \\"expression\\" became \\"statement\\", and \\"eval\\" (short for \\"evaluation\\") became \\"review\\". This resulted in many unintended corrections, such as \\"prreviewent\\" (prevalent), \\"reviewuation\\" (evaluation) and \\"medireview\\" (medieval). When asked about these changes, Yahoo! explained that the changed words were common terms used in web scripting, and were blacklisted to prevent hackers from sending damaging commands via the program's HTML function. Starting before February 7, 2006, Yahoo! Mail ended the practice, and began to add an underscore as a prefix to certain suspicious words and word fragments. Greylisting Incoming mail to Yahoo! addresses can be subjected to deferred delivery as part of Yahoo's incoming spam controls. This can delay delivery of mail sent to Yahoo! addresses without the sender or recipients being aware of it. The deferral is typically of short duration, but may extend up to several hours. Yahoo! does not specifically document this policy in detail, although some information is available. Controversies Shi Tao arrest In 2004, Yahoo's Hong Kong office provided technical information to the Chinese authorities about the account of journalist Shi Tao, who was subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for \\"leaking state secrets\\". Yahoo! was criticized by Reporters Without Borders for acting as a \\"police informant\\" to increase its profits. In August 2007, the United States Congress began an investigation into Yahoo's handling of the case. Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang testified before Congress. On November 6, 2007, the congressional panel criticized Yahoo! for not giving full details to the House Foreign Affairs Committee the previous year, stating it had been \\"at best inexcusably negligent\\" and at worst \\"deceptive\\". Representative Tom Lantos described its executives as moral \\"pygmies\\". Yang stated that Yahoo! no longer controlled its Chinese operations, and was collaborating with human rights groups to formulate ethical code for technology companies. In a February 2006 hearing, Yahoo! executives swore that they had received no information about the investigation. Several months later, it was discovered that the document provided to Yahoo! China on April 22, 2004, by the Beijing State Security Bureau stated that \\"Your office is in possession of the following items relating to a case of suspected illegal provision of state secrets to foreign entities.\\" On November 13, 2007, Yahoo! settled with Shi for an undisclosed sum. Shi was released from prison in September 2013. Username bans On February 20, 2006, it was revealed that Yahoo! Mail was banning the word \\"Allah\\" in email usernames, both separately and as part of a user name such as . Shortly after the news of the ban, it was lifted on February 23, 2006. Along with this action, Yahoo! also made the following statement: Exploit In November 2012, an exploit for Yahoo! Mail was sold for $700 by an Egyptian hacker, allowing hijackers to hack Yahoo! Mail user accounts and redirect users to a malicious website. The attack used cross-site scripting which let hackers steal cookies. In January 2013, hacker and security researcher Shahin Ramezany pointed out another DOM-based XSS loophole that placed 400 million users at risk. Deletion of accounts In 2013, Yahoo deleted accounts that hadn't been logged into for more than 12 months and gave those names to other users. This included accounts that had set up email forwarding to other accounts, who didn't notice and act upon the message to preserve their account. Spillover from this action resulted in some users losing access to accounts on other services as their email resets were no longer forwarded to them, but to the new owner of their former account. Phishing attack From 2007, Yahoo! was the email service used by New Zealand Telecom, which came under criticism in early 2013 following a spam and phishing attack that was described as the biggest to have ever hit the country. Telecom and Yahoo! automatically reset \\"about 60,000\\" users' passwords. In April, Telecom announced that despite the issue, it would retain Yahoo! as an email provider. Account theft On October 3, 2017, Yahoo reported that all Yahoo user accounts, approximately 3 billion, were affected by the previously announced August 2013 theft of accounts. This information updates the December 14, 2016, announcement that more than 1 billion user accounts were hacked in a breach that had occurred back in 2013. Earlier that year in September, Yahoo! announced that an additional 500 million user accounts had been breached in 2014. The company was said to have discovered about the breach that affected hundreds of millions of accounts years before their initial announcement. Automated scanning of email content The contents of Yahoo! Mail messages are scanned for the purposes of targeted advertising, in contrast to its main competitors Gmail (which ended the practice in late 2017) and Outlook.com (which did not employ the practice).  Content sharing with the National Security Agency  In 2015, Reuters reported that Yahoo! has implemented a functionality to scan all incoming emails for specific keywords and share email content in real time with the US National Security Agency. Platforms The mobile app for Yahoo! Mail can be downloaded from the App Store for iOS, and the Google Play Store for Android. Both versions of the app perform the same function, but are tailored to the mobile device's operating system. Some characteristics include replying to a message by opening a notification and separately archiving, deleting and starring notifications. It is available in several languages.

In older classifications it used to be the only family of the order Plantaginales, but numerous phylogenetic studies, summarized by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, have demonstrated that this taxon should be included within Lamiales. Overview The plantain family as traditionally circumscribed consisted of only three genera: Bougueria, Littorella, and Plantago. However phylogenetic research has indicated that Plantaginaceae sensu stricto (in the strict sense) were nested within Scrophulariaceae (but forming a group that did not include the type genus of that family, Scrophularia). Although Veronicaceae (1782) is the oldest family name for this group, Plantaginaceae (1789) is a conserved name under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) and thus has priority over any earlier family name for a family including Plantago. Furthermore, the ICBN does not consider family names published before 1789 to be names eligible for conservation, thus ruling out Veronicaceae. The name Antirrhinaceae has been proposed for conservation over Plantaginaceae. In the meantime, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has accepted the name Plantaginaceae. However, Olmstead (2003) chose to use the name Veronicaceae, a later synonym. A group of genera including Lindernia has now been segregated as the family Linderniaceae, which is recognized by Haston et al. 2007 (also known as LAPG II) as \\"Post-APG II family\\". Plantaginaceae sensu lato (in the broad sense) are a diverse, cosmopolitan family, occurring mostly in temperate zones. The group consists of herbs, shrubs and also a few aquatic plants with roots (such as the genus Callitriche). As the family is so diverse, its circumscription is difficult to establish. The leaves are spiral to opposite and simple to compound. Unusual in Lamiales is the absence of vertical partitions in the heads of the glandular hairs. The structure and form of the flowers is variable. Some genera are 4-merous (i.e., with 4 sepals and 4 petals), such as Aragoa (but this one has 5 sepals); others are 5- to 8-merous, such as Sibthorpia. The flowers of most genera are polysymmetric. The corolla is often two-lipped. In some taxa, the androecium is formed before the corolla. The fruit is a capsule that dehisces through the partitions between the cells.  Genera  Bacopa monnieri in Hyderabad, India. Achetaria azurea in Kerala The enlarged Plantaginaceae consists of 94 genera and about 1,900 species. The largest genus is Veronica, with about 450 species. Veronica also includes the genera Hebe, Parahebe and Synthyris, formerly often treated as distinct. All genera of Plantaginaceae were formerly included in Scrophulariaceae except where otherwise stated. {- valign=top  ; Tribe Angelonieae * Angelonia Humb. & Bonpl. * Basistemon Turcz. * Melosperma Benth. * Monopera Barringer * Monttea Gay * Ourisia Comm. ex Juss. ; Tribe Antirrhineae * Acanthorrhinum Rothm. * Albraunia Speta * Anarrhinum Desf. * Antirrhinum L. * Asarina Mill. * Chaenorhinum (DC.)

In simple terms, the method is the trial and error technique of using test (\\"false\\") values for the variable and then adjusting the test value according to the outcome. This is sometimes also referred to as \\"guess and check\\". Versions of the method predate the advent of algebra and the use of equations. As an example, consider problem 26 in the Rhind papyrus, which asks for a solution of (written in modern notation) the equation . This is solved by false position. First, guess that to obtain, on the left, . This guess is a good choice since it produces an integer value. However, 4 is not the solution of the original equation, as it gives a value which is three times too small. To compensate, multiply (currently set to 4) by 3 and substitute again to get , verifying that the solution is . Modern versions of the technique employ systematic ways of choosing new test values and are concerned with the questions of whether or not an approximation to a solution can be obtained, and if it can, how fast can the approximation be found. Two historical types Two basic types of false position method can be distinguished historically, simple false position and double false position. Simple false position is aimed at solving problems involving direct proportion. Such problems can be written algebraically in the form: determine such that :ax = b , if and are known. The method begins by using a test input value , and finding the corresponding output value by multiplication: . The correct answer is then found by proportional adjustment, . Double false position is aimed at solving more difficult problems that can be written algebraically in the form: determine such that :f(x) = ax + c = 0 , if it is known that :f(x_1) = b_1, \\\\qquad f(x_2) = b_2 . Double false position is mathematically equivalent to linear interpolation. By using a pair of test inputs and the corresponding pair of outputs, the result of this algorithm given by, : x = \\\\frac{b_1 x_2 - b_2 x_1}{b_1 - b_2}, would be memorized and carried out by rote. Indeed, the rule as given by Robert Recorde in his Ground of Artes (c. 1542) is: :::Gesse at this woorke as happe doth leade. :::By chaunce to truthe you may procede. :::And firste woorke by the question, :::Although no truthe therein be don. :::Suche falsehode is so good a grounde, :::That truth by it will soone be founde. :::: From many bate to many mo, :::From to fewe take to fewe also. :::With to much ioyne to fewe againe, :::To to fewe adde to manye plaine. :::In crossewaies multiplye contrary kinde, :::All truthe by falsehode for to fynde. For an affine linear function, :f(x) = ax + c , double false position provides the exact solution, while for a nonlinear function it provides an approximation that can be successively improved by iteration. History The simple false position technique is found in cuneiform tablets from ancient Babylonian mathematics, and in papyri from ancient Egyptian mathematics.Jean-Luc Chabert, ed., A History of Algorithms: From the Pebble to the Microchip (Berlin: Springer, 1999), pp. 86-91. Double false position arose in late antiquity as a purely arithmetical algorithm. In the ancient Chinese mathematical text called The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (‰πùÁ´†ÁÆóË°ì), dated from 200 BC to AD 100, most of Chapter 7 was devoted to the algorithm. There, the procedure was justified by concrete arithmetical arguments, then applied creatively to a wide variety of story problems, including one involving what we would call secant lines on a conic section. A more typical example is this \\"joint purchase\\" problem: > Now an item is purchased jointly; everyone contributes 8 [coins], the excess > is 3; everyone contributes 7, the deficit is 4. Tell: The number of people, > the item price, what is each? Answer: 7 people, item price 53.Shen Kangshen, > John N. Crossley and Anthony W.-C. Lun, 1999. The Nine Chapters on the > Mathematical Art: Companion and Commentary. Oxford: Oxford University Press, > p. 358. Between the 9th and 10th centuries, the Egyptian mathematician Abu Kamil wrote a now-lost treatise on the use of double false position, known as the Book of the Two Errors (KitƒÅb al-kha·π≠ƒÅ æayn). The oldest surviving writing on double false position from the Middle East is that of Qusta ibn Luqa (10th century), an Arab mathematician from Baalbek, Lebanon. He justified the technique by a formal, Euclidean-style geometric proof. Within the tradition of medieval Muslim mathematics, double false position was known as hisƒÅb al-kha·π≠ƒÅ æayn (\\"reckoning by two errors\\"). It was used for centuries to solve practical problems such as commercial and juridical questions (estate partitions according to rules of Quranic inheritance), as well as purely recreational problems. The algorithm was often memorized with the aid of mnemonics, such as a verse attributed to Ibn al-Yasamin and balance-scale diagrams explained by al-Hassar and Ibn al-Banna, all three being mathematicians of Moroccan origin. Available online at: http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/Biblio/COMHISMA8paper.doc and Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) devoted Chapter 13 of his book Liber Abaci (AD 1202) to explaining and demonstrating the uses of double false position, terming the method regulis elchatayn after the al-kha·π≠ƒÅ æayn method that he had learned from Arab sources. In 1494, Pacioli used the term el cataym in his book Summa de arithmetica, probably taking the term from Fibonacci. Other European writers would follow Pacioli and sometimes provided a translation into Latin or the vernacular. For instance, Tartaglia translates the Latinized version of Pacioli's term into the vernacular \\"false positions\\" in 1556. Pacioli's term nearly disappeared in the 16th century European works and the technique went by various names such as \\"Rule of False\\", \\"Rule of Position\\" and \\"Rule of False Position\\". Regula Falsi appears as the Latinized version of Rule of False as early as 1690. Several 16th century European authors felt the need to apologize for the name of the method in a science that seeks to find the truth. For instance, in 1568 Humphrey Baker says: Numerical analysis The method of false position provides an exact solution for linear functions, but more direct algebraic techniques have supplanted its use for these functions. However, in numerical analysis, double false position became a root-finding algorithm used in iterative numerical approximation techniques. Many equations, including most of the more complicated ones, can be solved only by iterative numerical approximation. This consists of trial and error, in which various values of the unknown quantity are tried. That trial-and- error may be guided by calculating, at each step of the procedure, a new estimate for the solution. There are many ways to arrive at a calculated- estimate and regula falsi provides one of these. Given an equation, move all of its terms to one side so that it has the form, , where is some function of the unknown variable . A value that satisfies this equation, that is, , is called a root or zero of the function and is a solution of the original equation. If is a continuous function and there exist two points and such that and are of opposite signs, then, by the intermediate value theorem, the function has a root in the interval . There are many root-finding algorithms that can be used to obtain approximations to such a root. One of the most common is Newton's method, but it can fail to find a root under certain circumstances and it may be computationally costly since it requires a computation of the function's derivative. Other methods are needed and one general class of methods are the two-point bracketing methods. These methods proceed by producing a sequence of shrinking intervals , at the th step, such that contains a root of . Two-point bracketing methods These methods start with two -values, initially found by trial-and-error, at which has opposite signs. Under the continuity assumption, a root of is guaranteed to lie between these two values, that is to say, these values \\"bracket\\" the root. A point strictly between these two values is then selected and used to create a smaller interval that still brackets a root. If is the point selected, then the smaller interval goes from to the endpoint where has the sign opposite that of . In the improbable case that , a root has been found and the algorithm stops. Otherwise, the procedure is repeated as often as necessary to obtain an approximation to the root to any desired accuracy. The point selected in any current interval can be thought of as an estimate of the solution. The different variations of this method involve different ways of calculating this solution estimate. Preserving the bracketing and ensuring that the solution estimates lie in the interior of the bracketing intervals guarantees that the solution estimates will converge toward the solution, a guarantee not available with other root finding methods such as Newton's method or the secant method. The simplest variation, called the bisection method, calculates the solution estimate as the midpoint of the bracketing interval. That is, if at step , the current bracketing interval is , then the new solution estimate is obtained by, :c_k=\\\\frac{a_k+b_k}{2}. This ensures that is between and , thereby guaranteeing convergence toward the solution. Since the bracketing interval's length is halved at each step, the bisection method's error is, on average, halved with each iteration. The method gains roughly a decimal place of accuracy, for each 3 iterations. The regula falsi (false position) method The first two iterations of the false position method. The red curve shows the function and the blue lines are the secants. The convergence rate of the bisection method could possibly be improved by using a different solution estimate. The regula falsi method calculates the new solution estimate as the -intercept of the line segment joining the endpoints of the function on the current bracketing interval. Essentially, the root is being approximated by replacing the actual function by a line segment on the bracketing interval and then using the classical double false position formula on that line segment. More precisely, suppose that in the -th iteration the bracketing interval is . Construct the line through the points and , as illustrated. This line is a secant or chord of the graph of the function . In point-slope form, its equation is given by : y - f(b_k) = \\\\frac{f(b_k)-f(a_k)}{b_k-a_k} (x-b_k). Now choose to be the -intercept of this line, that is, the value of for which , and substitute these values to obtain : f(b_k) + \\\\frac{f(b_k)-f(a_k)}{b_k-a_k} (c_k-b_k) = 0. Solving this equation for ck gives: : c_k = b_k - f(b_k) \\\\frac{b_k- a_k}{f(b_k)-f(a_k)} = \\\\frac{a_k f(b_k) - b_k f(a_k)}{f(b_k) - f(a_k)}. This last symmetrical form has a computational advantage: As a solution is approached, and will be very close together, and nearly always of the same sign. Such a subtraction can lose significant digits. Because and are always of opposite sign the ‚Äúsubtraction‚Äù in the numerator of the improved formula is effectively an addition (as is the subtraction in the denominator too). At iteration number , the number is calculated as above and then, if and have the same sign, set and , otherwise set and . This process is repeated until the root is approximated sufficiently well. The above formula is also used in the secant method, but the secant method always retains the last two computed points, and so, while it is slightly faster, it does not preserve bracketing and may not converge. The fact that regula falsi always converges, and has versions that do well at avoiding slowdowns, makes it a good choice when speed is needed. However, its rate of convergence can drop below that of the bisection method. Analysis Since the initial end-points and are chosen such that and are of opposite signs, at each step, one of the end-points will get closer to a root of . If the second derivative of is of constant sign (so there is no inflection point) in the interval, then one endpoint (the one where also has the same sign) will remain fixed for all subsequent iterations while the converging endpoint becomes updated. As a result, unlike the bisection method, the width of the bracket does not tend to zero (unless the zero is at an inflection point around which ). As a consequence, the linear approximation to , which is used to pick the false position, does not improve as rapidly as possible. One example of this phenomenon is the function : f(x) = 2x^3-4x^2+3x on the initial bracket [‚àí1,1]. The left end, ‚àí1, is never replaced (it does not change at first and after the first three iterations, is negative on the interval) and thus the width of the bracket never falls below 1. Hence, the right endpoint approaches 0 at a linear rate (the number of accurate digits grows linearly, with a rate of convergence of 2/3). For discontinuous functions, this method can only be expected to find a point where the function changes sign (for example at for or the sign function). In addition to sign changes, it is also possible for the method to converge to a point where the limit of the function is zero, even if the function is undefined (or has another value) at that point (for example at for the function given by when and by , starting with the interval [-0.5, 3.0]). It is mathematically possible with discontinuous functions for the method to fail to converge to a zero limit or sign change, but this is not a problem in practice since it would require an infinite sequence of coincidences for both endpoints to get stuck converging to discontinuities where the sign does not change, for example at in :f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{(x-1)^2} + \\\\frac{1}{(x+1)^2}. The method of bisection avoids this hypothetical convergence problem. Improvements in regula falsi Though regula falsi always converges, usually considerably faster than bisection, there are situations that can slow its convergence ‚Äì sometimes to a prohibitive degree. That problem isn't unique to regula falsi: Other than bisection, all of the numerical equation-solving methods can have a slow-convergence or no-convergence problem under some conditions. Sometimes, Newton's method and the secant method diverge instead of converging ‚Äì and often do so under the same conditions that slow regula falsi's convergence. But, though regula falsi is one of the best methods, and even in its original un-improved version would often be the best choice; for example, when Newton's isn't used because the derivative is prohibitively time-consuming to evaluate, or when Newton's and Successive-Substitutions have failed to converge. Regula falsi's failure mode is easy to detect: The same end-point is retained twice in a row. The problem is easily remedied by picking instead a modified false position, chosen to avoid slowdowns due to those relatively unusual unfavorable situations. A number of such improvements to regula falsi have been proposed; two of them, the Illinois algorithm and the Anderson‚ÄìBj√∂rk algorithm, are described below. The Illinois algorithm The Illinois algorithm halves the -value of the retained end point in the next estimate computation when the new -value (that is, )) has the same sign as the previous one ()), meaning that the end point of the previous step will be retained. Hence: : c_k = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{2}f(b_k) a_k - f(a_k) b_k}{\\\\frac{1}{2}f(b_k) - f(a_k)} or : c_k = \\\\frac{f(b_k) a_k - \\\\frac{1}{2}f(a_k) b_k}{f(b_k) - \\\\frac{1}{2}f(a_k)}, down-weighting one of the endpoint values to force the next to occur on that side of the function. The factor ¬Ω used above looks arbitrary, but it guarantees superlinear convergence (asymptotically, the algorithm will perform two regular steps after any modified step, and has order of convergence 1.442). There are other ways to pick the rescaling which give even better superlinear convergence rates. The above adjustment to regula falsi is called the Illinois algorithm by some scholars. Ford (1995) summarizes and analyzes this and other similar superlinear variants of the method of false position. Anderson‚ÄìBj√∂rck algorithm Suppose that in the -th iteration the bracketing interval is and that the functional value of the new calculated estimate has the same sign as . In this case, the new bracketing interval and the left-hand endpoint has been retained. (So far, that's the same as ordinary Regula Falsi and the Illinois algorithm.) But, whereas the Illinois algorithm would multiply by , Anderson‚ÄìBj√∂rck algorithm multiplies it by , where has one of the two following values: :m = 1 - \\\\frac{f(c_k)}{f(b_k)} if that value of is positive, otherwise, let m = \\\\frac{1}{2}. For simple roots, Anderson‚ÄìBj√∂rck was the clear winner in Galdino's numerical tests. For multiple roots, no method was much faster than bisection. In fact, the only methods that were as fast as bisection were three new methods introduced by Galdino. But even they were only a little faster than bisection. Practical considerations When solving one equation, or just a few, using a computer, the bisection method is an adequate choice. Although bisection isn't as fast as the other methods‚Äîwhen they're at their best and don't have a problem‚Äîbisection nevertheless is guaranteed to converge at a useful rate, roughly halving the error with each iteration - gaining roughly a decimal place of accuracy with every 3 iterations. For manual calculation, by calculator, one tends to want to use faster methods, and they usually, but not always, converge faster than bisection. But a computer, even using bisection, will solve an equation, to the desired accuracy, so rapidly that there's no need to try to save time by using a less reliable method‚Äîand every method is less reliable than bisection. An exception would be if the computer program had to solve equations very many times during its run. Then the time saved by the faster methods could be significant. Then, a program could start with Newton's method, and, if Newton's isn't converging, switch to regula falsi, maybe in one of its improved versions, such as the Illinois or Anderson‚ÄìBj√∂rck versions. Or, if even that isn't converging as well as bisection would, switch to bisection, which always converges at a useful, if not spectacular, rate. When the change in has become very small, and is also changing very little, then Newton's method most likely will not run into trouble, and will converge. So, under those favorable conditions, one could switch to Newton's method if one wanted the error to be very small and wanted very fast convergence. Example code This example program, written in the C programming language, is an example of the Illinois algorithm. To find the positive number where , the equation is transformed into a root-finding form . #include #include double f(double x) { return cos(x) - x*x*x; } /* s,t: endpoints of an interval where we search e: half of upper bound for relative error m: maximal number of iterations */ double FalsiMethod(double s, double t, double e, int m) { double r,fr; int n, side=0; /* starting values at endpoints of interval */ double fs = f(s); double ft = f(t); for (n = 0; n < m; n++) { r = (fs*t - ft*s) / (fs - ft); if (fabs(t-s) < e*fabs(t+s)) break; fr = f(r); if (fr * ft > 0) { /* fr and ft have same sign, copy r to t */ t = r; ft = fr; if (side-1) fs /= 2; side = -1; } else if (fs * fr > 0) { /* fr and fs have same sign, copy r to s */ s = r; fs = fr; if (side+1) ft /= 2; side = +1; } else { /* fr * f_ very small (looks like zero) */ break; } } return r; } int main(void) { printf(\\"%0.15f \\", FalsiMethod(0, 1, 5E-15, 100)); return 0; } After running this code, the final answer is approximately 0.865474033101614.

The long river flows from the terminus of the Miami Canal at Miami International Airport to Biscayne Bay. It was originally a natural river inhabited at its mouth by the Tequesta Indians, but it was dredged and is now polluted throughout its route through Miami-Dade County. The mouth of the river is home to the Port of Miami and many other businesses whose pressure to maintain it has helped to improve the river's condition. Etymology Although it is widely believed that the name is derived from a Native American word that means \\"sweet water\\", the earliest mention of the name comes from Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, a captive of Indians in southern Florida for 17 years, when he referred to what is now Lake Okeechobee as the \\"Lake of Mayaimi, which is called Mayaimi because it is very large\\". The Mayaimi Indians were named after the lake, beside which they lived. Spanish records include the cacique of \\"Maimi\\" in a group of 280 Florida Indians that arrived in Cuba in 1710. Reports on a Spanish Mission to the Biscayne Bay area in 1743 mention \\"Maymies\\" or \\"Maim√≠es\\" living nearby. The river has also been known as the Garband River, Rio Ratones, Fresh Water River, Sweetwater River, and Lemon River. It has been known as the Miami River since the Second Seminole War of 1835‚Äì42. Natural river Map of Miami, Florida with the river in blue In its original natural state, the river started at rapids formed by water from the Everglades flowing over a rocky ledge four miles (6.4 km) from its mouth. Frederick H. Gerdes of the U.S. Coast Survey reported in 1849 that \\"[f]rom the upper falls to near its entrance into Key Biscayne Bay‚Ä¶ water in the Glades was above low tide\\". The rapids were removed when the Miami Canal was dredged in an attempt to drain the wetland. The river divided into a North Fork and a South Fork about three miles (4.8 km) above its mouth. Each fork extended only one mile (1.6 km) to rapids marking the edge of the Everglades. The North Fork had a greater flow and higher drop over its rapids. One-and-one-half miles (2.4 km) above the mouth of the river there was a tributary on the north side, called Wagner Creek, which was about two miles (3.2 km) long. The Miami River was also fed by several springs, including some in the bed of the river. Flow was variable, and in times of drought the river did not flow. Early history The mouth of the Miami River at Brickell Point (August 1935). The earliest known inhabitants of the area around the Miami River were the Tequestas. Their major town at the time of first European contact was on the north bank of the river near the mouth. Before the intensive development of Miami in the 20th century, mounds built by the Tequesta were located along the river. Spanish missions were briefly established beside the river in 1567‚Äì70 and in 1743, but the area was abandoned when Spain turned Florida over to Britain in 1765. The area around the Miami River attracted settlers throughout the 19th century, with the major exception of the years of the Seminole Wars, but had little effect on the river. The United States Army tried to dig a channel through the sandbar at the mouth of the river in 1856 but stopped when it was decided that Fort Dallas would not be made permanent. Dredging and pollution The Miami River in 2007 Modification of the river began in earnest with the arrival of the Florida East Coast Railway in Miami in 1896. There was much dredging and filling along the river. The rapids at the head of the South Fork were removed in 1908. From 1909 to 1912, the Miami Canal was dug, bypassing the rapids at the head of the North Fork. The canal was dammed off from the river for most of the construction period. When the canal was opened to the river in March 1912, large amounts of Everglades muck and finely ground stone from the dredging were washed down the river, silting it. As a result, the lower river had to be dredged three times in two years. Dredging of the river and of canals connecting to the river continued into the 1930s. Deepening the Miami River (and other streams and canals draining into Biscayne Bay), as well as the drainage of the Everglades that was a major purpose of the dredging, led to saltwater intrusion in the area, forcing the abandonment of drinking water wells on several occasions. By the 1940s, dams were being installed on the canals leading into the Miami River to prevent salt water from traveling inland. The Miami River also became polluted. In 1897, Miami's first sewer line started emptying directly into the river. By the 1950s, 29 sewers were dumping untreated sewage into the river. Dade County constructed a sewage treatment plant on Virginia Key in the 1950s and connected sewer lines to it, routing the raw sewage away from the river. Commercial use The Miami River is likely the shortest working river in the United States. The Center for Urban & Environmental Solutions reported in 2008: \\"Waterborne commerce through the Miami River port doubled between an annual level of about 250,000 short tons in the early 1970s to about 500,000 in the early years of the new century. Foreign trade accounts for most of the commerce through the Miami River Port. Exports dominate the Port's commerce, accounting for over 75 percent of the total. In the 1970s, exports had averaged 56 percent of the total. Most of the Miami River's foreign trade is with the nearby countries of the Caribbean, especially the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the Bahamas. This reflects the suitability of the Miami River for shallow draft vessels which serve the many shallow draft ports in the Caribbean.\\" The Miami River has long been home to many small cargo terminals at which smaller ships (up to about in length) call to load cargo, most of which is destined for ports in the Bahamas and various Caribbean nations. It is also an area into which all manner of contraband--illegal drugs, illegal aliens--has been discharged into the United States. Because of continuing efforts by the United States Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), DEA and other agencies, the illicit trade has been minimized in recent years. Although the part of the river from Northwest 36th Street to its mouth is still polluted, this has been mitigated considerably by rigid enforcement of both international and U.S. laws regarding discharge of oil and sewage by ships, as well as of laws addressing industrial dumping. The muddy bottom, however, is still reported to contain undesirable substances in significant quantities. In years past, many vessels docked in the river at the ends of their last voyages were abandoned and sank alongside the docks, creating eyesores and hazards to navigation. Those derelicts have been removed. Invoking the authority of Port State Control, the U.S. Coast Guard vigorously enforces the many international and national regulations regarding safety equipment, construction, maintenance, and manning of ships entering all U.S. ports including the Miami River, virtually eliminating the many dangerously substandard vessels that had sailed from the U.S. in previous years. In recent years, realizing they had common interests, various business entities along the river formed the Miami River Marine Group. The group works closely with local law enforcement agencies, the U.S. Coast Guard, ICE, and others to maintain clear channels of communication and cooperation. It now acts much as one port with numerous port facilities and support entities such as agents, surveyors, consultants, naval architects and engineers, and ship and machinery repair businesses. Many of the ships sailing from the Miami River carry cargo to ports in Haiti including Port-au-Prince, Mirago√¢ne, Cap-Ha√Øtien, Port-de-Paix, Saint-Marc, Gona√Øves, and Jacmel. Their cargo typically consist of dry foodstuffs such as beans and rice, canned goods, clothing, household goods and appliances, and used cars, trucks, and buses. In times past, some of the cargo terminals on the river were areas of lawlessness. Law enforcement and regulatory agencies have eliminated most of that sort of activity. When the International Ship and Port Security Code and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Act of 2002 came into force (and in the prior runup) on July 1, 2004, most opportunities for crime were eliminated. Redevelopment The new Miami Riverwalk as of May 2008, where pedestrians can walk along the river, dine at various cafes and shop at various boutiques Some of the terminals and other business related to cargo shipping on the \\"lower end\\" of the river near downtown Miami have been eliminated or moved farther upstream because of illicit shipping activities. The \\"lower end\\" of the river has been the subject of much renovation and building of high rise offices, hotels, and living structures. A number of residential and mixed-use projects have been constructed along the Miami River. They include Latitude on the River, Mint at Riverfront, Neo Vertika, River Oaks Marina and Tower, and Terrazas Miami. Starting in the 2000s, two urban greenway projects known as the Miami Riverwalk and Miami River Greenway were started.

Administration The Northwest Region (known before 2008 as the Northwest Province) is the third most populated province in Cameroon. It has one major metropolitan city, Bamenda, with several other smaller towns such as Wum, Kumbo, Mbengwi, Ndop, Nkamb√©, Batibo, Bambui and Oshie. The province saw an increase in its population from approximately 1.2 million in 1987 to an estimated 1.8 million in 2010. The population density of 99.12 people per square kilometer is higher than the national average of 22.6. The provincial urban growth rate is 7.95%, higher than the national average of 5.6%, while the rural growth rate, at 1.16%, is equal to the national rate. In 2001, according to the Statistical Provincial Services of the North-West Province, the population of the province is young, with over 62% of its residents being less than 20 years old. Therefore, the dependency rate in the province is high, particularly in the rural areas. Divisions of Northwest Cameroon Like other regions in Cameroon, the Northwest Region is made up of administrative divisions. The province was created in 1972 with five divisions or departments: Bui, Donga-Mantung, Menchum, Mezam, and Momo. Today, it has seven divisions, the additions being Boyo, which was carved out of the Menchum division, and Ngo-Ketunjia or Ngoketunjia, split off from the Mezam division. Each division is further subdivided, with thirty-one total subdivisions in the Northwest Province. The basic unit of local government is the council, and there are thirty-two councils in the region. Population The Northwest Region has many ethnic groups, including immigrants from other regions and countries. Nigeria is well represented, as it borders the region to both the north and the northwest. The native population comprises a variety of ethnic and linguistic groups. The main ethnic groups are of Tikar origin: Tikari, Widikum, Fulani, and Moghamo. The most widely spoken languages in the province include Mungaka, Limbum spoken by the Wimbum people of Donga Mantung Division; Yamba, spoken by the Yamba people also of the Donga Mantung Division; Bafmen, Oku, Lamnso, Ngemba, Pidgin English, Balikumbat, Papiakum, Moghamo, and Nkom. During the colonial period, administrative boundaries were created which cut across ethnic groups and cultures. As a result, parts of some ethnic groups now lie in different divisions and provinces, which is believed to have led to several land conflicts. In the provinces, the social organization recognizes a chief as its head, also called the Fon. The Fons, who in their tribal area may be more influential than the official administrative authorities, are considered the living representative of the tribal ancestors.  Politics  The Northwest is a stronghold of the Social Democratic Front (SDF) which is one of the main opposition parties of Cameroon. Some Northwesterners feel completely marginalized by the government. There is also a secessionist movement, the SCNC (Southern Cameroon's National Council) whose goal is to secede from Cameroon and form a republic consisting of the English-speaking regions. Much of the SCNC's influence exists in the Northwest. In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, Paul Biya, signed decrees abolishing \\"Provinces\\" and replacing them with \\"Regions\\". The Northwest Province subsequently became the Northwest Region. Natural attractions Rivers of the NW Region The Northwest region has unique attractions, including the second highest mountain in West Africa.

It is a rod- shaped, Gram-negative soil bacterium. Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as the T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', not to be confused with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis), from a plasmid into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome. Plant genomes can be engineered by use of Agrobacterium for the delivery of sequences hosted in T-DNA binary vectors. A. tumefaciens is an alphaproteobacterium of the family Rhizobiaceae, which includes the nitrogen-fixing legume symbionts. Unlike the nitrogen-fixing symbionts, tumor- producing Agrobacterium species are pathogenic and do not benefit the plant. The wide variety of plants affected by Agrobacterium makes it of great concern to the agriculture industry. Economically, A. tumefaciens is a serious pathogen of walnuts, grape vines, stone fruits, nut trees, sugar beets, horse radish, and rhubarb, and the persistent nature of the tumors or galls caused by the disease make it particularly harmful for perennial crops. A. tumefaciens grows optimally at 28 ¬∞C. The doubling time can range from 2.5‚Äì4h depending on the media, culture format, and level of aeration. At temperatures above 30 ¬∞C, A. tumefaciens begins to experience heat shock which is likely to result in errors in cell division. Conjugation To be virulent, the bacterium contains tumour-inducing plasmid (Ti plasmid or pTi), of 200 kbp, which contains the T-DNA and all the genes necessary to transfer it to the plant cell. Many strains of A. tumefaciens do not contain a pTi. Since the Ti plasmid is essential to cause disease, prepenetration events in the rhizosphere occur to promote bacterial conjugation - exchange of plasmids amongst bacteria. In the presence of opines, A. tumefaciens produces a diffusible conjugation signal called 30C8HSL or the Agrobacterium autoinducer . This activates the transcription factor TraR, positively regulating the transcription of genes required for conjugation .  Method of infection  A. tumefaciens infects the plant through its Ti plasmid. The Ti plasmid integrates a segment of its DNA, known as T-DNA, into the chromosomal DNA of its host plant cells. A. tumefaciens has flagella that allow it to swim through the soil towards photoassimilates that accumulate in the rhizosphere around roots. Some strains may chemotactically move towards chemical exudates from plants, such as acetosyringone and sugars, which indicate the presence of a wound in the plant through which the bacteria may enter. Phenolic compounds are recognised by the VirA protein, a transmembrane protein encoded in the virA gene on the Ti plasmid. Sugars are recognised by the chvE protein, a chromosomal gene-encoded protein located in the periplasmic space. At least 25 vir genes on the Ti plasmid are necessary for tumor induction . In addition to their perception role, virA and chvE induce other vir genes. The virA protein has autokinase activity: it phosphorylates itself on a histidine residue. Then the virA protein phosphorylates the virG protein on its aspartate residue. The virG protein is a cytoplasmic protein produced from the virG Ti plasmid gene. It is a transcription factor, inducing the transcription of the vir operons. The chvE protein regulates the second mechanism of the vir genes' activation. It increases VirA protein sensitivity to phenolic compounds. Attachment is a two-step process. Following an initial weak and reversible attachment, the bacteria synthesize cellulose fibrils that anchor them to the wounded plant cell to which they were attracted. Four main genes are involved in this process: chvA, chvB, pscA, and att. The products of the first three genes apparently are involved in the actual synthesis of the cellulose fibrils. These fibrils also anchor the bacteria to each other, helping to form a microcolony. VirC, the most important virulent gene, is a necessary step in the recombination of illegitimate recolonization. It selects the section of the DNA in the host plant that will be replaced and it cuts into this strand of DNA. After production of cellulose fibrils, a calcium-dependent outer membrane protein called rhicadhesin is produced, which also aids in sticking the bacteria to the cell wall. Homologues of this protein can be found in other rhizobia. Currently, there are several reports on standardisation of protocol for the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Effect of different parameters like, infection time, acetosyringone, DTT, cysteine have been studied in soybean (Glycine max) Possible plant compounds that initiate Agrobacterium to infect plant cells:U.S. Patent 6483013 *Acetosyringone and other phenolic compounds *alpha-Hydroxyacetosyringone *Catechol *Ferulic acid *Gallic acid *p-Hydroxybenzoic acid *Protocatechuic acid *Pyrogallic acid *Resorcylic acid *Sinapinic acid *Syringic acid *Vanillin Formation of the T-pilus To transfer the T-DNA into the plant cell, A. tumefaciens uses a type IV secretion mechanism, involving the production of a T-pilus. When acetosyringone and other substances are detected, a signal transduction event activates the expression of 11 genes within the VirB operon which are responsible for the formation of the T-pilus. The pro-pilin is formed first. This is a polypeptide of 121 amino acids which requires processing by the removal of 47 residues to form a T-pilus subunit. The subunit is circularized by the formation of a peptide bond between the two ends of the polypeptide. Products of the other VirB genes are used to transfer the subunits across the plasma membrane. Yeast two-hybrid studies provide evidence that VirB6, VirB7, VirB8, VirB9 and VirB10 may all encode components of the transporter. An ATPase for the active transport of the subunits would also be required.

A VirD1/D2 complex nicks the DNA at the left and right border sequences. The VirD2 protein is covalently attached to the 5' end. VirD2 contains a motif that leads to the nucleoprotein complex being targeted to the type IV secretion system (T4SS). In the cytoplasm of the recipient cell, the T-DNA complex becomes coated with VirE2 proteins, which are exported through the T4SS independently from the T-DNA complex. Nuclear localization signals, or NLSs, located on the VirE2 and VirD2, are recognised by the importin alpha protein, which then associates with importin beta and the nuclear pore complex to transfer the T-DNA into the nucleus. VIP1 also appears to be an important protein in the process, possibly acting as an adapter to bring the VirE2 to the importin. Once inside the nucleus, VIP2 may target the T-DNA to areas of chromatin that are being actively transcribed, so that the T-DNA can integrate into the host genome. Genes in the T-DNA Hormones To cause gall formation, the T-DNA encodes genes for the production of auxin or indole-3-acetic acid via the IAM pathway. This biosynthetic pathway is not used in many plants for the production of auxin, so it means the plant has no molecular means of regulating it and auxin will be produced constitutively. Genes for the production of cytokinins are also expressed. This stimulates cell proliferation and gall formation. Opines The T-DNA contains genes for encoding enzymes that cause the plant to create specialized amino acid derivatives which the bacteria can metabolize, called opines. Opines are a class of chemicals that serve as a source of nitrogen for A. tumefaciens, but not for most other organisms. The specific type of opine produced by A. tumefaciens C58 infected plants is nopaline (Escobar et al., 2003). Two nopaline type Ti plasmids, pTi-SAKURA and pTiC58, were fully sequenced. A. tumefaciens C58, the first fully sequenced pathovar, was first isolated from a cherry tree crown gall. The genome was simultaneously sequenced by Goodner et al. and Wood et al. in 2001. The genome of A. tumefaciens C58 consists of a circular chromosome, two plasmids, and a linear chromosome. The presence of a covalently bonded circular chromosome is common to Bacteria, with few exceptions. However, the presence of both a single circular chromosome and single linear chromosome is unique to a group in this genus. The two plasmids are pTiC58, responsible for the processes involved in virulence, and pAtC58, dubbed the \\"cryptic\\" plasmid. The pAtC58 plasmid has been shown to be involved in the metabolism of opines and to conjugate with other bacteria in the absence of the pTiC58 plasmid. If the pTi plasmid is removed, the tumor growth that is the means of classifying this species of bacteria does not occur. Biotechnological uses Plants that have undergone transformation with Agrobacterium The DNA transmission capabilities of Agrobacterium have been vastly explored in biotechnology as a means of inserting foreign genes into plants. Marc Van Montagu and Jeff Schell, (University of Ghent and Plant Genetic Systems, Belgium) discovered the gene transfer mechanism between Agrobacterium and plants, which resulted in the development of methods to alter the bacterium into an efficient delivery system for genetic engineering in plants. The plasmid T-DNA that is transferred to the plant is an ideal vehicle for genetic engineering. This is done by cloning a desired gene sequence into T-DNA binary vectors that will be used to deliver a sequence of interest into eukaryotic cells. This process has been performed using firefly luciferase gene to produce glowing plants . This luminescence has been a useful device in the study of plant chloroplast function and as a reporter gene. It is also possible to transform Arabidopsis thaliana by dipping flowers into a broth of Agrobacterium: the seed produced will be transgenic. Under laboratory conditions, the T-DNA has also been transferred to human cells, demonstrating the diversity of insertion application. The mechanism by which Agrobacterium inserts materials into the host cell is by a type IV secretion system which is very similar to mechanisms used by pathogens to insert materials (usually proteins) into human cells by type III secretion. It also employs a type of signaling conserved in many Gram-negative bacteria called quorum sensing . This makes Agrobacterium an important topic of medical research, as well . Natural genetic transformation Natural genetic transformation in bacteria is a sexual process involving the transfer of DNA from one cell to another through the intervening medium, and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination. A. tumefaciens can undergo natural transformation in soil without any specific physical or chemical treatment.  Disease cycle  Disease cycle of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Agrobacterium tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. Agrobacterium species live predominantly saprophytic lifestyles, so its common even for plant-parasitic species of this genus to survive in the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. Agrobacterium performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA into the plant's genome. See above for more details about the process of plasmid DNA insertion into the host genome. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes this tissue to become crushed and/or distorted. The crushed vessels lead to reduced water flow in the xylem. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes the breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.  Disease management  Crown gall disease caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be controlled by using various different methods. The best way to control this disease is to take preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools so as to avoid infecting new plants. Performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields are also valuable practices. Avoiding wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation is important for preventing disease. In horticultural techniques in which multiple plants are joined together to grow as one, such as budding and grafting these techniques lead to plant wounds. Wounds are the primary location of bacterial entry into the host plant. Therefore, it is advisable to perform these techniques during times of the year when Agrobacteria are not active. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection, since these insects cause wounds (aka bacterial entryways) in the plant roots. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years. Biological control methods are also utilized in managing this disease. During the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice for treating germinated seeds, seedlings, and rootstock was to soak them in a suspension of K84. K84 is composed of A. radiobacter, which is a species related to A. tumefaciens but is not pathogenic. K84 produces a bacteriocin (agrocin 84) which is an antibiotic specific against related bacteria, including A. tumefaciens. This method, which was successful at controlling the disease on a commercial scale, had the risk of K84 transferring its resistance gene to the pathogenic Agrobacteria. Thus, in the 1990s, the use of a genetically engineering strain of K84, known as K-1026, was created. This strain is just as successful in controlling crown gall as K84 without the caveat of resistance gene transfer.  Environment  Crown gall of sunflower caused by A. tumefaciens Host, environment, and pathogen are extremely important concepts in regards to plant pathology. Agrobacteria have the widest host range of any plant pathogen, so the main factor to take into consideration in the case of crown gall is environment. There are various conditions and factors that make for a conducive environment for A. tumefaciens when infecting its various hosts. The bacterium can't penetrate the host plant without an entry point such as a wound. Factors leading to wounds in plants include cultural practices, grafting, freezing injury, growth cracks, soil insects, and other animals in the environment causing damage to the plant. Consequently, in exceptionally harsh winters, it is common to have an increased incidence of crown gall due to the weather- related damage. Along with this, there are methods of mediating infection of the host plant. For example, nematodes can act as a vector to introduce Agrobacterium into plant roots. More specifically, the root parasitic nematodes damage the plant cell, creating a wound for the bacteria to enter through. Finally, temperature is a factor when considering A. tumefaciens infection. The optimal temperature for crown gall formation due to this bacterium is 22 degrees Celsius because of the thermosensitivity of T-DNA transfer. Tumor formation is significantly reduced at higher temperature conditions.

Metzger & Trevor W. Morrison, \\"The Presumption of Constitutionality and the Individual Mandate\\" in The Health Care Case: The Supreme Court's Decision and Its Implications (eds. Nathaniel Persily, Gillian E. Metzger & Trevor W. Morrison: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 136. United States In its strongest form--advocated most notably by James Bradley Thayer--the presumption of constitutionality gives Congress, rather than the courts, the primary responsibility for interpreting the Constitution. This view is in tension with the view of judicial review articulated in Marbury v. Madison, however. Thus, a less strong form of the presumption, repeatedly articulated by the Supreme Court of the United States, has become the dominant approach in American law: \\"[r]espect for a coordinate branch of Government forbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality.\\" Constitutional law scholars Gillian E. Metzger and Trevor Morrison summarize this principle as follows: \\"although the Court's determination of constitutional invalidity always trumps the contrary judgment of a coordinate branch, the Court should not lightly arrive at such a determination.\\" The presumption of constitutionality is linked to the doctrine of constitutional avoidance (the doctrine that courts will not make rulings on constitutional issues if the case can be resolved on a non-constitutional basis) and the rule that courts will not interpret an ambiguous statute to be unconstitutional in the absence of clear unconstitutionality. The Supreme Court has held that statutes implicating certain fundamental individual rights are not subject to the general presumption, and are evaluated instead through heightened levels of scrutiny. By contrast, economic legislation is subject to the presumption of constitutionality. In Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote that courts should be able strike down a statute as unconstitutional only if there is an \\"irreconcilable variance\\" between the statute and the constitution.Hamilton, Alexander. Federalist #78 (1788-06-14). Otherwise, a statute should be upheld. Likewise, at the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, Virginia delegate George Mason said that judges \\"could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course.\\"\\"Founders‚Äô Constitution, Article 1, Section 7, Clauses 2 and 3\\", Records of the Federal Convention (1787-06-04). Professor Randy Barnett argues that such a presumption is itself unconstitutional and suggests that government should be forced to prove that laws that violate liberty are necessary, replacing the presumption of constitutionality with what he calls the \\"presumption of liberty.\\"Barnett, Randy. Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty (Princeton University Press 2004).

Once a subsidiary of Kodak, today it is an independent global specialty materials company that produces a broad range of advanced materials, chemicals and fibers for everyday purposes. Founded in 1920 and based in Kingsport, Tennessee, the company now has more than 50 manufacturing sites worldwide and employs approximately 14,500 people. Eastman was spun off from parent Eastman Kodak in 1994 and had 2019 sales revenue of approximately $9.3 billion. Business segments Eastman manufactures and markets chemicals, fibers and plastics. It provides coatings, adhesives and specialty plastics products, is a major supplier of cellulose acetate fibers, and produces copolyesters for packaging. The company's products and operations are currently managed and reported in four operating segments: Additives & Functional Products, Advanced Materials, Chemical Intermediates and Fibers. ;Additives & Functional Products In this segment, Eastman manufactures chemicals and adhesive resins for products in the coatings and tires industries in transportation, building and construction, durable goods, health and wellness, and consumables markets. ;Advanced Materials In this segment, Eastman produces and markets specialty copolyesters, cellulose esters, interlayers, and aftermarket window film products for use in transportation, consumables, building and construction, durable goods, health and wellness, and electronics. ;Chemical Intermediates The Chemical Intermediates segment leverages large scale and vertical integration from the acetyl, olefins, and alkylamine streams and proprietary manufacturing technology for specialty fluids to manufacture diversified products that are sold externally for use in markets such as industrial chemicals and processing; building and construction; health and wellness; energy, fuels, and water; consumables; agriculture, as well as used internally by other Eastman segments. ;Fibers In the Fibers segment, Eastman manufactures and sells Estron‚Ñ¢ acetate tow and Estrobond‚Ñ¢ triacetin plasticizers for use primarily in the manufacture of cigarette filters; Estron‚Ñ¢ natural and Chromspun‚Ñ¢ solution-dyed acetate yarns for use in apparel, home furnishings and industrial fabrics; and cellulose acetate flake and acetyl raw materials for other acetate fiber producers. History Early years An effect of World War I was a scarcity in raw materials such as photographic paper, optical glass, gelatin and many chemicals, including methanol, acetic acid and acetone. After the war ended, Eastman Kodak founder George Eastman began working to have an independent supply of chemicals for his photographic processes. His search for suitable quantities of methanol and acetone led him to the southern United States. In 1920, Tennessee Eastman was founded with two major platforms ‚Äì organic chemicals and acetyls. Products such as calcium acetate, sodium acetate, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride became the basis for the company‚Äôs platforms. During World War II, RDX, a powerful explosive, was manufactured for the U.S. government at Holston Ordnance Works at Tennessee Eastman sites. At the peak of production near the end of the war, the ordnance plant was producing a million and a half pounds of explosives each day. Tennessee Eastman was responsible for managing the Y-12 National Security Complex at Oak Ridge, Tennessee which produced enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, from 1943 to May 1947. Since the 1980s In 1983, Eastman opened the first commercial coal gasification facility in the United States at its Kingsport plant site to produce chemicals from syngas rather than petroleum. The \\"Chemicals from Coal Facility\\" at the Kingsport plant was recognized as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in 1995. In 1994, Eastman spun off from Eastman Kodak and became an independent corporation. In early 2005, Eastman broke ground on the first world-scale manufacturing facility using IntegRex, a technology that reduces the number of intermediate process steps in producing PET resin. This technology is now owned by DAK Americas. In July 2012, Eastman completed its acquisition of Solutia Inc., a manufacturer of performance materials and specialty chemicals, for $4.8 billion. In December 2014, Eastman completed its acquisition of Taminco Corporation for $2.8 billion. October 2017 explosion On the morning of October 4, 2017, an explosion occurred at its Kingsport Plant around the coal gasification building. In April 2018, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation determined the cause to be a valve blockage due to slurry or debris intrusion.  Circular Economy  In 2019, Eastman began commercial-scale chemical recycling for a broad set of waste plastics that would otherwise be placed in a landfill or incinerated. Eastman Advanced Circular Recycling technologies complement mechanical recycling by processing a wide spectrum of waste plastics that traditional recycling methods cannot, including polyesters, polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene. These waste plastics are derived from a variety of sources, including single-use plastics, textiles, and cuttings from discarded carpet. Eastman's recycling technologies - carbon renewal technology and polyester renewal technology - provide a true circular solution of infinite recycling for materials, allowing them to be reused repeatedly. Eastman began commercial operation of carbon renewal technology in October 2019 at the company's largest manufacturing facility in Kingsport, Tenn. In 2020, Eastman will use carbon renewal technology to recycle millions of pounds of polyester carpet that would otherwise have been placed in a landfill. Mexican Pine Sourcing Controversy An article in the Daily Beast in 2017 reported on Eastman Chemical's office in Uruapan, Michoac√°n. The article asserted that even after being notified Eastman's sourcing of raw pine chemicals was from a business the Mexican government found was operating in cooperation with the Knights Templars, a criminal cartel. The pine chemical supplier was utilizing the cartel to extort gatherers to accept a submarket price with a portion of the reduction passed to Eastman.

Eastman facilities in four U.S. states released 7.02 million pounds of chemicals into the air in that year. The Environmental Protection Agency has also linked Eastman to several Superfund toxic waste sites, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Eastman has been a member of Responsible Care¬Æ, a global voluntary initiative developed autonomously by the chemical industry to improve health, safety, and environmental performance, for more than 25 years. In 2013, Eastman was named Responsible Care Company of the Year in the large company category by the American Chemistry Council (ACC). Eastman was awarded the 2009 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award presented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The award recognizes technologies that incorporate the principles of green chemistry into chemical design, manufacture, and use. In 2013, the EPA designated a 3-km radius circle around the Eastman facility in Kingsport, TN as nonattainment for the 2010 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO2) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). The State of Tennessee continues to monitor ambient sulfur dioxide levels within the nonattainment area. Through 2015, Eastman improved energy intensity by approximately 8% compared to a 2008 baseline. The company established a goal to improve energy intensity 20% by 2020. In 2014 and early 2016, Eastman converted two boilers at its Kingsport, Tennessee, site from coal to natural gas combustion. Three additional boilers will be converted by 2018 for a total of five. The Kingsport boiler conversion project is the most significant air pollution control project in the history of Eastman and will diversify the Kingsport facility‚Äôs energy mix from 90% coal to 50% coal and 50% natural gas. Eastman also converted a coal-fired boiler at its Indian Orchard facility in Springfield, Massachusetts, to natural gas in 2015. As of 2019, Eastman has been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year eight consecutive years.

J. Conn that uses horizontal gene transfer to cause tumors in plants. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the most commonly studied species in this genus. Agrobacterium is well known for its ability to transfer DNA between itself and plants, and for this reason it has become an important tool for genetic engineering. The genus Agrobacterium is quite heterogeneous. Recent taxonomic studies have reclassified all of the Agrobacterium species into new genera, such as Ahrensia, Pseudorhodobacter, Ruegeria, and Stappia, but most species have been controversially reclassified as Rhizobium species. Plant pathogen The large growths on these roots are galls induced by Agrobacterium sp. Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown-gall disease in plants. The disease is characterised by a tumour-like growth or gall on the infected plant, often at the junction between the root and the shoot. Tumors are incited by the conjugative transfer of a DNA segment (T-DNA) from the bacterial tumour- inducing (Ti) plasmid. The closely related species, Agrobacterium rhizogenes, induces root tumors, and carries the distinct Ri (root-inducing) plasmid. Although the taxonomy of Agrobacterium is currently under revision it can be generalised that 3 biovars exist within the genus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Agrobacterium rhizogenes, and Agrobacterium vitis. Strains within Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes are known to be able to harbour either a Ti or Ri-plasmid, whilst strains of Agrobacterium vitis, generally restricted to grapevines, can harbour a Ti-plasmid. Non- Agrobacterium strains have been isolated from environmental samples which harbour a Ri-plasmid whilst laboratory studies have shown that non- Agrobacterium strains can also harbour a Ti-plasmid. Some environmental strains of Agrobacterium possess neither a Ti nor Ri-plasmid. These strains are avirulent. The plasmid T-DNA is integrated semi-randomly into the genome of the host cell, and the tumor morphology genes on the T-DNA are expressed, causing the formation of a gall. The T-DNA carries genes for the biosynthetic enzymes for the production of unusual amino acids, typically octopine or nopaline. It also carries genes for the biosynthesis of the plant hormones, auxin and cytokinins, and for the biosynthesis of opines, providing a carbon and nitrogen source for the bacteria that most other micro-organisms can't use, giving Agrobacterium a selective advantage. By altering the hormone balance in the plant cell, the division of those cells cannot be controlled by the plant, and tumors form. The ratio of auxin to cytokinin produced by the tumor genes determines the morphology of the tumor (root-like, disorganized or shoot-like). In humans Although generally seen as an infection in plants, Agrobacterium can be responsible for opportunistic infections in humans with weakened immune systems, but has not been shown to be a primary pathogen in otherwise healthy individuals. One of the earliest associations of human disease caused by Agrobacterium radiobacter was reported by Dr. J. R. Cain in Scotland (1988). A later study suggested that Agrobacterium attaches to and genetically transforms several types of human cells by integrating its T-DNA into the human cell genome. The study was conducted using cultured human tissue and did not draw any conclusions regarding related biological activity in nature. Uses in biotechnology The ability of Agrobacterium to transfer genes to plants and fungi is used in biotechnology, in particular, genetic engineering for plant improvement. Genomes of plants and fungi can be engineered by use of Agrobacterium for the delivery of sequences hosted in T-DNA binary vectors. A modified Ti or Ri plasmid can be used. The plasmid is 'disarmed' by deletion of the tumor inducing genes; the only essential parts of the T-DNA are its two small (25 base pair) border repeats, at least one of which is needed for plant transformation. The genes to be introduced into the plant are cloned into a plant binary vector that contains the T-DNA region of the disarmed plasmid, together with a selectable marker (such as antibiotic resistance) to enable selection for plants that have been successfully transformed. Plants are grown on media containing antibiotic following transformation, and those that do not have the T-DNA integrated into their genome will die. An alternative method is agroinfiltration. S. chacoense) transformed using Agrobacterium. Transformed cells start forming calluses on the side of the leaf pieces Transformation with Agrobacterium can be achieved in multiple ways. Protoplasts or alternatively leaf-discs can be incubated with the Agrobacterium and whole plants regenerated using plant tissue culture. In agroinfiltration the Agrobacterium may be injected directly into the leaf tissue of a plant. This method transforms only cells in immediate contact with the bacteria, and results in transient expression of plasmid DNA. Agroinfiltration is commonly used to transform tobacco (Nicotiana). A common transformation protocol for Arabidopsis is the floral dip method: inflorescence are dipped in a suspension of Agrobacterium, and the bacterium transforms the germline cells that make the female gametes. The seeds can then be screened for antibiotic resistance (or another marker of interest), and plants that have not integrated the plasmid DNA will die when exposed to the correct condition of antibiotic. Agrobacterium does not infect all plant species, but there are several other effective techniques for plant transformation including the gene gun. Agrobacterium is listed as being the vector of genetic material that was transferred to these USA GMOs:The FDA List of Completed Consultations on Bioengineered Foods * Soybean * Cotton * Maize * Sugar Beet * Alfalfa * Wheat * Rapeseed Oil (Canola) * Creeping bentgrass (for animal feed) * Rice (Golden Rice) The transformation of fungi using Agrobacterium is used primarily for research purposes, and follows similar approaches as for plant transformation. The Ti plasmid system is modified to include DNA elements to select for transformed fungal strains, after co- incubation of Agrobacterium strains carrying these plasmids with fungal species. Genomics The sequencing of the genomes of several species of Agrobacterium has permitted the study of the evolutionary history of these organisms and has provided information on the genes and systems involved in pathogenesis, biological control and symbiosis. One important finding is the possibility that chromosomes are evolving from plasmids in many of these bacteria. Another discovery is that the diverse chromosomal structures in this group appear to be capable of supporting both symbiotic and pathogenic lifestyles. The availability of the genome sequences of Agrobacterium species will continue to increase, resulting in substantial insights into the function and evolutionary history of this group of plant-associated microbes. History Marc Van Montagu and Jozef Schell at the University of Ghent (Belgium) discovered the gene transfer mechanism between Agrobacterium and plants, which resulted in the development of methods to alter Agrobacterium into an efficient delivery system for gene engineering in plants. A team of researchers led by Dr Mary-Dell Chilton were the first to demonstrate that the virulence genes could be removed without adversely affecting the ability of Agrobacterium to insert its own DNA into the plant genome (1983).

The D. L. Clark Company of Pittsburgh's north side purchased the patent for it from Charles Burke, who experimented with various flavors of chewing gum in the basement of 533 McClintock Ave, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Teaberry is currently marketed by First Source, LLC in Buffalo, New York, and made in Mexico. The gum dates to 1900. The popularity of Teaberry peaked in the 1960s. It was additionally popularized when Pelican Films (292 Madison Avenue, New York, New York) produced a series of commercials using music from Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. Clark liked \\"The Mexican Shuffle\\" from the South of the Border album, and commissioned Herb to rerecord it as \\"The Teaberry Shuffle\\".http://www.amcorner.com/forum/threads/clarks-teaberry-shuffle.2866/ In each commercial, a placid person would unwrap a stick of Clark's Teaberry gum and start chewing it. The chewer would abruptly break into a rapid, energetic dance with distinctive shuffling steps for several seconds, then would just as abruptly return to his or her original activity. For instance, one commercial in the campaign featured a column of marching soldiers: one soldier in the middle of the column chewed the gum and stepped out of the column to dance the Teaberry Shuffle, then resumed his position in the column and fell back into step. In all the commercials, the dance steps were quite simple; the creators of the ad campaign may have hoped that the commercials would inspire a dance craze. The gum's mintlike flavor recalls that of Gaultheria procumbens, the eastern teaberry, from which it derives its name. The gum is pink in color, individually wrapped in white paper, and wrapped again in a pink teaberry-printed paper.

Both the United States and the Soviet Union developed nuclear weapons small enough to be portable in specially-designed backpacks during the 1950s and 1960s.. The maximum yield of the W54 warhead used in the Special Atomic Demolition Munition (pictured) was 1 kt (1000 tonnes of TNT equivalent). This is larger and heavier than the US W48 nuclear shell at 155 mm (6.1 inches) in diameter and 846 mm (33.3 inches) long and weighing 53.5 kg (118 lb), which represents the smallest complete, self-contained physics package to be fielded and had a yield of 72 tonnes of TNT. Nuclear weapons designer Ted Taylor has alleged that a 105 mm (4.1 inch) diameter shell with a mass of 19 kg is theoretically possible. Conversely, reduction beyond the size of the W54 means that linear implosion designs must be employed and neutron reflectors dispensed with (\\"bare core\\"), so a much larger mass of fissile material is required and explosive yield is reduced dramatically. Taylor's figures represent the minimum size and mass to sustain a prompt criticality but the duration without tamper or neutron reflection would be short. The slope of exponential growth, estimated number of fissions, and specific fissile material are not recorded. Neptunium-236 is fissile and possesses the smallest and lightest critical mass, but isolation of the specific radionuclide makes it an impractical choice. Several other novel fissile materials are known, but U-235 and Pu-239 are the only practical options although two US tests using U-233 (critical mass some 32% less than U235) have taken place. Carey Sublette stated that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union have ever made public the existence or development of weapons small enough to fit into a normal-sized suitcase or briefcase. The W48 however, does fit the criteria of small, easily disguised, and portable; but its explosive yield was extremely small for a nuclear weapon. In the mid-1970s, debate shifted from the possibility of developing such a device for the military to concerns over its possible use in nuclear terrorism.\\"Preventing Suitcase Warfare: Loren Eiseley, the great University of Pennsylvania author and anthropologist, recently predicted a future of 'suitcase warfare,' in which terrorists would utilize miniaturized atomic weapons.\\" Forbes 115 (1975), p. 115. The concept became a staple of the spy thriller genre in the later Cold War era.Used e.g. in The Fourth Protocol by Frederick Forsyth (1984). After the end of the Cold War frequently invoked as a trope of the period, e.g. in the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell video game (2002) North [from] Calcutta (2009) by Duane Evans concerns the planned use of a suitcase bomb in the India-Pakistan conflict, cited as a realistic depiction of this type of threat by H. B. Peake, \\"The Intelligence Officer's Bookshelf\\", Studies in Intelligence, Journal of the American Intelligence Professional, Unclassified Extracts from Studies in Intelligence 53.3, Central Intelligence Agency, Government Printing Office (September 2009), p. 44. Etymology The term \\"suitcase (nuclear/atomic) bomb\\" was introduced during the 1950s with the prospect of reducing the size of the smallest tactical nuclear weapons even further, albeit purely as a \\"figure of speech\\" for miniaturization, not necessarily for the delivery in actual suitcases. Overview The value of portable nuclear weapons lies in their ability to be easily smuggled across borders, transported by means widely available, and placed as close to the target as possible. In nuclear weapon design, there is a trade-off in small weapons designs between weight and compact size. Extremely small (as small as diameter and long) linear implosion type weapons, which might conceivably fit in a large briefcase or typical suitcase, have been tested, but the lightest of those are nearly and had a maximum yield of only 0.19 kiloton (the Swift nuclear device, tested in Operation Redwing's Yuma test on May 27, 1956). The largest yield of a relatively compact linear implosion device was under 2 kilotons for the cancelled (or never deployed but apparently tested) US W82-1 artillery shell design, with yield under 2 kilotons for a artillery shell in diameter and long. Soviet Union and Russia Stanislav Lunev, the highest- ranking GRU defector, claimed that such Russian-made devices exist and described them in more detail.Stanislav Lunev. Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev. Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. . The devices, \\"identified as RA-115s (or RA-115-01s for submersible weapons)\\" weigh from fifty to sixty pounds. They can last for many years if wired to an electric source. In case there is a loss of power, there is a battery backup. If the battery runs low, the weapon has a transmitter that sends a coded message either by satellite or directly to a GRU post at a Russian embassy or consulate. According to Lunev, the number of \\"missing\\" nuclear devices (as found by General Lebed) \\"is almost identical to the number of strategic targets upon which those bombs would be used.\\" Lunev suggested that suitcase nukes might be already deployed by the GRU operatives on US soil to assassinate US leaders in the event of war. He alleged that arms caches were hidden by the KGB in many countries. They were booby-trapped with \\"Lightning\\" explosive devices. One such cache, identified by Vasili Mitrokhin, exploded when Swiss authorities sprayed it with a high pressure water gun in a wooded area near Bern. Several others caches were removed successfully.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin (1999) The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West. Allen Lane. , page 475-476 Lunev said that he had personally looked for hiding places for weapons caches in the Shenandoah Valley area and that \\"it is surprisingly easy to smuggle nuclear weapons into the US\\" either across the Mexican border or using a small transport missile that can slip undetected when launched from a Russian airplane. US Congressman Curt Weldon supported claims by Lunev but noted that Lunev had \\"exaggerated things\\" according to the FBI.Nicholas Horrock, \\"FBI focusing on portable nuke threat\\", UPI (20 December 2001). Searches of the areas identified by Lunev have been conducted, \\"but law-enforcement officials have never found such weapons caches, with or without portable nuclear weapons.\\"Steve Goldstein and Chris Mondics, \\"Some Weldon-backed allegations unconfirmed; Among them: A plot to crash planes into a reactor, and missing suitcase-size Soviet atomic weapons.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer (15 March 2006) A7. Former Russian National Security Adviser Aleksandr Lebed in an interview with CBS newsmagazine Sixty Minutes on 7 September 1997 claimed that the Russian military had lost track of more than a hundred out of a total of 250 \\"suitcase-sized nuclear bombs\\". Lebed stated that these devices were made to look like suitcases, and that he had learned of their existence only a few years earlier. Russia's Federal Agency on Atomic Energy on 10 September rejected Lebed's claims as baseless.\\"'We don't know what General Lebed is talking about. No such weapons exist,' a ministry spokesman told AFP. 'Perhaps he meant old Soviet nuclear artillery shells, which are all being safely guarded.' Carey Sublette, Alexander Lebed and Suitcase Nukes (2002). US Congressman Curt Weldon revived the question in 1999, displaying a \\"notional model\\" of what a Russian \\"suitcase nuke\\" might look like in a hearing on 26 October, and \\"lambasting the Clinton administration for not aggressively questioning the Russian government about the existence and location of hidden KGB weapons caches in the United States.\\"Congressman Weldon Fears Soviets Hid A-Bombs Across U.S. NTI, 26 October 1999. Peter Richmond, How to Build a Briefcase Nuke, GQ, February 2002. According to colonel general of RVSN Viktor Yesin, small-scale nuclear bombs have never been operated by the KGB, but only by the Russian Army. All such devices have been stored in a weapons depot inside Russia, and only left it for checks at the plant which produced them. In mid-1998, a special commission of Russia's Security Council has investigated the storage and utilization of such bombs and found out that no bombs were stolen or lost. Yesin has suggested that Lebed might be misled because of some loose dummy small-scale nuclear bomb, which have the equal size and weight to the real device. Dummy bombs are used for training missions in the Russian army and such devices could have indeed been lost during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. United States The lightest nuclear warhead ever acknowledged to have been manufactured by the U.S. is the W54, which was used in both the Davy Crockett 120 mm recoilless rifle-launched warhead and the backpack-carried version called the Mk-54 SADM (Special Atomic Demolition Munition). The bare warhead package was an 11 in by 16 in (28 cm by 41 cm, small enough to fit in a footlocker-sized container) cylinder that weighed 51 lbs (23 kg). Former Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G. Vickers has claimed that he, along with other Green Berets special forces troops, practiced infiltrating Warsaw Pact countries with backpack-sized nuclear weapons, with a mission to \\"detonate a portable nuclear bomb.\\" These were known as Green Light Teams. In 1994, the United States Congress passed The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, preventing the government from developing nuclear weapons with a yield of less than 5 kilotons, thereby making the official development of these weapons in the US unlawful. This law was repealed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. Israel Allegations were made in the 1990s that Israel had developed suitcase nuclear bombs during the 1970s..

Max Julius Friedrich Vasmer (; ; 28 February 1886 ‚Äì 30 November 1962) was a Russo-German linguist. He studied problems of etymology in Indo- European, Finno-Ugric and Turkic languages and worked on the history of Slavic, Baltic, Iranian, and Finno-Ugric peoples. Biography Born to German parents in Saint Petersburg, Vasmer graduated from Saint Petersburg University in 1907. From 1910, he delivered lectures there as a professor. During the Russian Civil War of 1917‚Äì1922, he worked in the Universities of Saratov and of Dorpat (Tartu). In 1921, he settled in Leipzig, but in 1925 moved to Berlin. In 1938‚Äì1939, he delivered lectures at Columbia University in New York City. It was there that he started to work on his magnum opus, the Etymological dictionary of the Russian language. He delivered the eulogy for Professor Aleksander Br√ºckner in Berlin-Wilmersdorf in 1939 and he took over the chair of Slavistic studies at the University of Berlin. In 1944, the bombing of Vasmer's house in Berlin destroyed most of his materials.

While assistant gunner, Phaulkon came to Siam (present day Thailand), as a merchant in 1675 after working for England's East India Company. Phaulkon became fluent in Siamese language in just a few years (he was also fluent in English, French, Portuguese, and Malay). In 1679, Burnaby presented Phaulkon into the service of the Phra Khlang Kosa Lek to help facilitate the trade. In 1681, Lek introduced him into the court of King Narai and Phaulkon began to work as a interpreter, quickly gained the royal favor. Due to his experience with the East India Company, he also worked in the treasury. Rise to power There were many accounts to Phaulkon's rise to power and winning the favour of King Narai. One of which was his efficiency in accounting, in which he investigated a claim by Persian traders that the treasury had owed them debt. Phaulkon came to the conclusion that it was the Persian traders whom owed the treasury after his inspection of the account; garnering much revenue for the treasury at the expense of the traders. Another story suggests that King Narai wanted to investigate the weight of a cannon. Phaulkon proceeded to place the cannon on a boat, and marked a waterline. He then removed the cannon and filled the boat with rice until it reaches the drawn waterline.http://www.deanbarrettthailand.com/phaulkon_of_siam.htm Due to Phaulkon's competence and administrative abilities, as well as his knowledge of Europe, King Narai came to favour him greatly. In 1682, Phaulkon abandoned Anglicanism for CatholicismRajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co.

Their marriage brought two sons, George \\"Jorge\\" Phaulkon and Constantin \\"Jo√£o\\" Phaulkon.Cangelaris 2011, p. 91. In 1683 Phaulkon suggested a plan to King Narai for the construction of the fort of Mergui in polygonal European style, which was strongly opposed by Kosa Lek. Lek was later accused of receiving bribes from peasants who did not want to be drafted into the Mergui construction and was later flogged with rattan sticks under the King's orders. Lek died due to the injuries inflicted on him about a month later in July, and his properties were later confiscated. King Narai offered Lek's former position to Phaulkon, which he declined and instead accepted the advisory role to the Malay noble Okya Wang, who had assumed the position.

Constance Phaulkon is seen kowtowing in the lower left corner of the print, making a gesture telling the ambassador to raise the letter up to the king. Ban Wichayen (residence of Constantine Phaulkon), Lopburi, Thailand. Following troubles with the English and the Dutch, Phaulkon engineered a Franco-Siamese rapprochement leading to the exchange of numerous embassies between France and Siam, as well as the dispatch of an expeditionary force by the French by 1687. Phaulkon, called Monsieur Constance by the French and addressed cher ami by their king, was their main ally for several years. In recognition King Louis XIV of France awarded him with the knighthood of the Order of Saint Michael, a hereditary title in the French nobility as well as French citizenship for him and his family.Cangelaris, Kefalonitiki Proodos, No. 7, p. 36 ff. King Narai had hoped to use the French as a counterweight to Dutch influence. The embassy of Chevalier de Chaumont in 1685 further strengthened ties between the two Kingdoms, Chaumont also being accompanied by Jesuit Guy Tachard and French naval commander Claude de Forbin, who would remain to serve King Narai as Governor of Bangkok, as well as training Siamese troops in European tactics with the Thai title Ok-Phrasaksongkram. Forbin would later become the subject of Phaulkon's bitter jealousy. During Tachard's presence in Siam, Phaulkon plotted to secure his power and influence; through secret diplomacy with the Jesuit. He drafted a letter requesting Frenchmen to be sent from France, whom he would to use his power to place in political and military offices, as his supporters, and under his patronage. Phaulkon also requested that King Louis XIV send troops and warships to secure the southern port city of Singora, which has been conceded to France by King Narai.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Constantine-Phaulkon The Greek favourite of King Narai also offered the concession of the port of Mergui, previously held by Phaulkon's English pirates- to French control, of which the King consented to eventually. Phaulkon became a prime counsellor to the king in 1685 and expresses a desire to designate a Catholic successor to King Narai, most likely, Phra Pi, who was Narai's adopted son and a Catholic convert, as well as scheming to convert the Kingdom to Catholicism through the presence of the French. Phaulkon wanted a successor who would uphold amiable relations with France and offer privileges to the French, which would guarantee his political standing and security in a court that has grown increasingly hostile to his influence and power. King Narai proceeded to send an embassy to France in response, led by Kosa Pan. An audience was granted by King Louis XIV at Versailles and the embassy toured the French country.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_embassy_to_France_(1686) Siamese embassy to Louis XIV led by Kosa Pan in 1686, by Nicolas Larmessin Feud with the East India Company As a result of his meteoric rise to power and King Narai's trust in him, Phaulkon's old English colleagues from the East India Company such as Richard Burnaby and Samuel White were given positions of power. A substantial amount of Englishmen and women also left the Company's jurisdiction, instead pledging fealty to King Narai due to their favoured status and settled in the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. Burnaby was made the governor of Mergui and White became its Harbourmaster.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Siamese_War However the two Englishmen entrusted with the port of Mergui had old vendettas against the Kingdom of Golconda in a past trading dispute, and proceeded to use their newly-acquired power to engage in piracy and warfare against Golconda and Indian shipping. This led to retaliation by the East India Company under President Elihu Yale in 1687, who subsequently sent Anthony Weltden with two warships to punish Burnaby and White, as well as demanding recompense from the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. The Company was also able to obtain an order from King James II forbidding Englishmen serving on foreign ships, due to the excess of Englishmen abandoning Company service for preferential treatment in the Kingdom of Ayutthaya.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Siamese_War Upon arrival of Weltden's ships, Burnaby and White were cowed into opening the gates and receiving the Company forces, who came ashore. During the negotiations, the local Siamese suspected White and Burnaby of treachery and rallied under the Governor of Tenasserim who led the massacre of many Englishmen and women in Mergui.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo- Siamese_War Richard Burnaby was slain in the slaughter but Weltden and White escaped with their lives, retreating into the sea. The butchery by the Governor also involved an ugly scene in which innocent Englishmen and women were slain, including an Englishwoman who was tortured and killed with her children for refusing the Governor's advances. When King Narai had heard of the transgressions against innocent English civilians, he had the Governor of Tenasserim summoned to Lopburi and executed, at Phaulkon's behest. War was also declared on the East India Company.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo- Siamese_War Character The Abb√© de Choisy, who was a member of the first French embassy to Thailand in 1685, wrote about M. Phaulkon's character: Downfall and death Phaulkon's closeness to the king earned him the envy of some Thai members of the royal court, which would eventually prove to be his undoing. When King Narai became terminally ill, a rumor spread that Phaulkon wanted to use the designated heir, Phra Pi, as a puppet and actually become ruler himself, according to Thai historical records this was in fact a credible claim. This provided credence for Pra Phetracha, the foster brother of Narai to stage a coup d'√©tat, the 1688 Siamese revolution. In Lopburi on 31 March 1688, Phaulkon had a discussion with the French general Marshal Desfarges for the plans to put down Petracha's plot before the latter moved to the Maha Roek Fort in Bangkok, however a month later on 15 April, Desfarges was persuaded by Frenchmen V√©ret and Abb√© de Lionne to abandon plans to go to Lopburi to help Phaulkon and remained in his fort instead. On 18 May, King Narai, Phra Pi, and their followers were arrested. Phaulkon was summoned to the palace, there he and his 21 men were surrounded by the Siamese soldiers and disarmed. He was taken to the palace dungeon where he was brutally tortured. Phra Pi was later decapitated on 20 May. On 25 May, Desfarges was summoned to Lopburi by Phetracha and arrived on 2 June, but there he spoke nothing of saving Phaulkon, making Petracha assumed that the French had abandoned him. On 5 June 1688, Desfarges departed Lopburi, leaving his two sons there as hostages. Phaulkon was made to hang Phra Pi's head around his neck and Phetracha declared him guilty of high treason. Phaulkon was placed on the silver palanquin mounted on his elephant, and was led out by Phetracha's men to the area of Wat Sak temple in the evening, where Luang Sorasak decapitated and also disemboweled him as witnessed by Father de B√®ze. His remains are buried in the shallow grave in front of Wat Sak, but on that same day, his remains were later dug up and eaten by wild dogs. When King Narai learned what had happened, he was furious, but was too weak to take any action. Narai died several days later on 11 July 1688, virtually a prisoner in his own palace. Phetracha then proclaimed himself the new king of Siam and began a xenophobic regime which expelled almost all foreigners from the kingdom. Legacy The different interpretations of Phetracha's motivation for ordering the arrest and execution of Phaulkon have made the Greek's position in Thai history somewhat controversial. Supporters of Phetracha's actions have depicted Phaulkon as an opportunistic foreigner who sought to use his influence to control of the kingdom on behalf of Western interests. More skeptical historians believe that Phaulkon was simply a convenient scapegoat ‚Äì a means for Phetracha to seize the throne from the rightful heir by capitalizing on the envy and suspicion Phaulkon had engendered. Popular culture Constantine Phaulkon was portrayed by Thai-Scottish actor in the 2018 Thai drama Buppesunniwas, receiving critical acclaim for his performance. Phaulkon was depicted as a complex character; cruel, abusive, cunning and overly-ambitious but also capable of compassion, love and remorse. Scott won a TVG Award for Best male supporting actor.https://th.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏û‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏™‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏™  Notes   References  * Smithies, Michael (2002), Three military accounts of the 1688 \\"Revolution\\" in Siam, Itineria Asiatica, Orchid Press, Bangkok, . * Cangelaris, Panagiotis D.

Its name (pronounced \\"apple core\\") is a pun. Its chief division is Apple Records, which was launched in the same year. Other divisions included Apple Electronics, Apple Films, Apple Publishing and Apple Retail, whose most notable venture was the short-lived Apple Boutique, on the corner of Baker Street and Paddington Street in central London. Apple's headquarters in the late 1960s was at the upper floors of 94 Baker Street, after that at 95 Wigmore Street, and subsequently at 3 Savile Row. The latter address was also known as the Apple Building, which was home to the Apple Studio. From 1970 to 2007, Apple's chief executive was former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall, although he did not officially bear that title until Allen Klein had left the company. The current CEO is Jeff Jones. In 2010, Apple Corps ranked number 2 on the Fast Company magazine's list of the world's most innovative companies in the music industry, thanks to the release of The Beatles: Rock Band video game and the remastering of the Beatles' catalogue.  History  The Beatles' accountants had informed the group that they had two million pounds that they could either invest in a business venture or else lose to the Inland Revenue, because corporate/business taxes were lower than their individual tax bills. According to Peter Brown, personal assistant to Beatles' manager Brian Epstein, activities to find tax shelters for the income that the Beatles generated began as early as 1963‚Äì64, when Dr Walter Strach23 February 1965: The Beatles begin filming Help! in the Bahamas  The Beatles Bible was put in charge of such operations. First steps into that direction were the foundation of Beatles Ltd and, in early 1967, Beatles and Co. The Beatles' publicist, Derek Taylor, remembered that Paul McCartney had the name for the new company when he visited Taylor's company flat in London: \\"We're starting a brand new form of business. So, what is the first thing that a child is taught when he begins to grow up? A is for Apple\\". McCartney then suggested the addition of Apple Core, but they could not register the name, so they used \\"Corps\\" (having the same pronunciation). McCartney later revealed that he had been inspired by Ren√© Magritte's painting, Le Jeu de Mourre, featuring an apple with the words \\"Au revoir\\" painted on it. Harriet Vyner's 1999 book about the late lamented charismatic London art dealer Robert Fraser, \\"Groovy Bob\\", contains this anecdote by McCartney about the first time he laid eyes on the painting that would inspire the company logo in 1967:Groovy Bob: The Life and Times of Robert Fraser by Harriet Vyner, Faber, 317 pp, October 1999, Formation On the founding of Apple John Lennon commented: \\"Our accountant came up and said 'We got this amount of money. Do you want to give it to the government or do something with it?' So we decided to play businessmen for a bit because we've got to run our own affairs now. So we've got this thing called 'Apple' which is going to be records, films, and electronics ‚Äì which all tie up\\". Stefan Granados wrote in Those Were the Days: An Unofficial History of the \\"Beatles\\" Apple Organization 1967‚Äì2001, on the various processes that led to the formation of Apple Corps: Now that a new business structure was found with a lower tax rate, Epstein mused what to do with it to justify it to the authorities, and originally thought of it mostly as a merchandising company, according to Lennon's first wife, Cynthia: \\"The idea Brian came up with was a company called Apple. His idea was to plough their money into a chain of shops not unlike Woolworth's in concept: Apple boutiques, Apple posters, Apple records. Brian needed an outlet for his boundless energy\\". Personal assistant to Epstein, Alistair Taylor remembered:Yesterday: The Beatles Remembered with Martin Robers, Pan Macmillan (1988), p. 108, In the middle of setting up the new company, manager Epstein died unexpectedly in what seemed an accidental sleeping pills overdose on 27 August 1967, which pressed the Beatles to accelerate their plans to gain control of their own financial affairs. In addition to providing an umbrella to cover the Beatles' own financial and business affairs, Apple was intended to provide a means of financial support to anyone in the wider world struggling to get 'worthwhile' artistic projects off the ground. According to Granados, this idea probably originated with Paul McCartney as the Beatle most engaged in London's local avant-garde scene, \\"McCartney was among the best-known exponents of swinging London\\". Ringo Starr was quoted as saying of the venture:Granados, M. Those Were the Days. p. 11. McCartney at first had obviously intended to use Epstein's music publishing company NEMS Enterprises for these plans, but after Epstein's death it was learned that Australian Robert Stigwood was trying to get hold of NEMS. All four Beatles were not in favour of such an outcome, as McCartney had previously told Epstein in 1967: They hurried to set up Apple instead, and seeing that the Beatles would not be part of the NEMS package, Stigwood went to form his own company, RSO Records. The Apple logo was designed by Gene Mahon, with illustrator Alan Aldridge transcribing the copyright notice to appear on record releases. In January 1968, Beatles Ltd. officially changed its name to Apple Corps. Ltd. and registered the Apple trademark in forty- seven countriesGranados, M. Those Were the Days. p. 24. In February the company also registered Apple Electronics, Apple Films Ltd., Apple Management, Apple Music Publishing, Apple Overseas, Apple Publicity, Apple Records, Apple Retail, and Apple Tailoring Civil and Theatrical with the intent on focusing on five divisions: records, electronics, film, publishing and retailing. Lennon and McCartney introduced their new business concept on a press conference held on 14 May 1968 in New York City, with McCartney saying it would be, \\"A beautiful place where you can buy beautiful things‚Ä¶ a controlled weirdness‚Ä¶ a kind of Western communism\\". Lennon said, \\"It's a company we're setting up, involving records, films, and electronics, and ‚Äì as a sideline ‚Äì manufacturing or whatever. We want to set up a system where people who just want to make a film about anything, don't have to go on their knees in somebody's office, probably yours\\". McCartney also said: \\"It's just trying to mix business with enjoyment. We're in the happy position of not needing any more money. So for the first time, the bosses aren't in it for profit. We've already bought all our dreams. We want to share that possibility with others\\".  Early administration  For the first few months of Apple's existence, it did not even have an office. Most of the company's business was conducted from the NEMS building. It was not until the autumn of 1967 that Apple finally opened a London office. Since the Beatles already owned a four-story building at 94 Baker Street that had been purchased as an investment property by their accountants, they decided that Baker Street was as good a location as any for Apple. In September they set up an office for Apple Publishing in the Baker Street building. With Epstein's death, there was nobody in the Beatles' inner circle with business acumen who could manage the company, and, as with their band affairs, the Beatles decided that they would manage it themselves. Alistair Taylor in the \\"one-man band advertisement\\" In December 1967, shortly after Epstein's death, Lennon asked Alistair Taylor to work as General Manager for Apple. It was during this period that Taylor appeared in the famous advertisement to promote Apple asking for new artists. Designed by McCartney, it showed him disguised as a one-man band, claiming: \\"This man has talent...\\" The publication in the New Musical Express and Rolling Stone brought an avalanche of applicants. The mail room, telephone switchboard, and conference rooms became jammed at all hours with \\"artists\\" begging the Beatles to give them money. George Harrison would later lament that \\"We had every freak in the world coming in there\\". Many of these supplicants received the investments they sought and were never heard from again. Even though Apple was declared the most successful new record company of the year for 1968 before long the band members' ignorance of finance and administration combined with their naive, utopian mission of funding struggling, unknown artists left Apple Corps with no solid business plan. The Beatles' naivete and inability to keep track of their own accounts was also eagerly exploited by the employees of Apple, who purchased drugs and alcoholic beverages, company lunches at expensive London restaurants, and international calls made regularly on office telephones, all of which would be treated as business expenses. Writers Alan Clayson and Spencer Leigh described the owners' hopelessness in managing their own creation: Aspinall finally agreed to direct the company on a temporary basis, simply so that someone would finally be in charge. When, in 1969, the Beatles engaged Klein as their manager, he also inherited the chairmanship of Apple Corps, which led to an immediate streamlining of company affairs: \\"Overnight, glib lack of concern deferred to pointed questions,\\" wrote Clayson & Leigh. \\"Which typist rings Canberra every afternoon? Why has so-and-so given himself a raise of 60 pounds a week? Why is he seen only on payday? Suddenly, lunch meant beans-on-toast in the office kitchen instead of Beluga caviar from Fortnum & Mason\\".  Beatles break-up and beyond  The first two years of the company's existence also coincided with a marked worsening of the Beatles' relationships with each other, ultimately leading to the break-up of the band in April, 1970. Apple quickly slid into financial chaos, which was resolved only after many years of litigation. When the Beatles' partnership was dissolved in 1975, dissolution of Apple Corps was also considered, but it was decided to keep it operating, while effectively retiring or mothballing all its divisions. The company is currently headquartered at 27 Ovington Square, in London's prestigious Knightsbridge district. Ownership and control of the company remains with McCartney, Starr and the estates of Lennon and Harrison. Apple Corps has had a long history of trademark disputes with Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.). The dispute was finally resolved in 2007, with Apple Corps transferring ownership of the \\"Apple\\" name and all associated trademarks to Apple Inc., and Apple Inc. exclusively licensing these back to the Beatles' company. In April 2007, Apple also settled a long running dispute with EMI and announced the retirement of chief executive Aspinall. Aspinall was replaced by Jeff Jones. Subsidiaries Apple Corps operated in various fields, mostly related to the music business and other media, through a number of subsidiaries. Apple Electronics Apple Electronics was the electronics division of Apple Corps, founded as Fiftyshapes Ltd., at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London. It was headed by Beatles' associate Yanni Alexis Mardas, whom Lennon had nicknamed Magic Alex. Intending to revolutionise the consumer electronics market, largely through products based on Mardas' unique and, as it turned out, commercially impractical designs, the electronics division did not make any breakthroughs. After the dismissal of Mardas in 1969, during Klein's 'house-cleaning' of Apple Corps, Apple Electronics fell victim to the same forces that troubled the company as a whole, including the impending Beatles' break-up. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least ¬£300,000 (approximately three million 2007 British pounds). Apple Films The Apple Films logo, from the DVD release of The Concert for Bangladesh. Apple Films is the film-making division of Apple Corps. Its first production was The Beatles' 1967 TV movie Magical Mystery Tour. The Beatles' films Yellow Submarine and Let it Be were also produced under Apple Films. Other notable releases included Raga (a 1971 documentary on Ravi Shankar), The Concert for Bangladesh (1972) and Little Malcolm (1974). The latter, produced by George Harrison, included the song \\"Lonely Man\\" by Dark Horse Records band Splinter. Apple Films was also responsible for producing Apple Corps' televised promotions.

In September 1967, the first artistes to be signed by Apple Publishing were two songwriters from Liverpool. Paul Tennant and David Rhodes were offered a contract after meeting McCartney in Hyde Park. They were advised to form a band by Epstein after he and Lennon heard their demos, calling the group Focal Point. Epstein was to have managed the band but died before he could become involved. Terry Doran MD of Apple Publishing became their manager and they were signed by Deram Records. Apple published the group's self-penned songs from early 1968. Another early band on its publishing roster was the group Grapefruit. Apple Publishing Ltd. was also used as a publishing stop-gap by Harrison and Starr, as they sought to shift control of their own songs away from Northern Songs, in which their status was little more than paid writers. (Harrison later started Harrisongs, and Starr created Startling Music). Apple's greatest publishing successes were the Badfinger hits \\"No Matter What\\", \\"Day After Day\\" and \\"Baby Blue\\", all written by group member Pete Ham, and Badfinger's \\"Without You\\", a song penned by Ham and Badfinger bandmate Tom Evans. \\"Without You\\" became a worldwide No. 1 chart hit for Harry Nilsson in 1972 and Mariah Carey in 1993. In 2005, however, Apple lost the US publishing rights for the work of Ham and Evans. Those rights were transferred to Bug Music, now a branch of BMG Rights Management. Apple also undertook publishing duties, at various times, for other Apple artists, including Yoko Ono, Billy Preston and the Radha Krsna Temple. Apple received a large number of demo tapes; some songs were published, some were issued on other labels and only Benny Gallagher & Lyle were retained as in- house writers before going on to co-found McGuinness Flint. Many of these demos have been collected on a series of CDs released by Cherry Red Records. They are entitled 94 Baker Street, An Apple for the Day, Treacle Toffee World, Lovers from the Sky: Pop Psych from the Apple Era 1968-1971 and 94 Baker Street Revisited: Poptastic Sounds from the Apple Era 1967-1968. Apple Books was largely inactive and had very few releases. One notable release was the book that accompanied the initial pressing of the Let It Be album entitled \\"The Beatles Get Back\\" containing photographs by Ethan Russell and text by Rolling Stone writers Jonathan Cott and David Dalton. Although the book was credited to Apple Publishing, all of the work on the project was actually done by freelancers.Granados, S. Those Were the Days. p. 44Yesterday by Robert FreemanMany Years From Now by Miles, In My Life by Pete ShottonThe Complete EMI Recording Sessions by Mark LewisohnThe Beatles London by Mark Lewisohn and Peter Schreuder. Apple Records and Zapple Records From 1968 onwards, new releases by the Beatles were issued by Apple Records, although the copyright remained with EMI, and Parlophone/Capitol catalogue numbers continued to be used. Apple releases of recordings by artists other than the Beatles, however, used a new set of numbers, and the copyrights were held mostly by Apple Corps Ltd. More than a \\"vanity label\\", Apple Records developed an eclectic roster of their own, releasing records by artists as diverse as Indian sitar guru Ravi Shankar, Welsh easy listening songstress Mary Hopkin, the power-pop band Badfinger, classical music composer John Tavener, soul singer Billy Preston, folk singer James Taylor, R&B; singer Doris Troy, New York underground rock band Elephant's Memory, original bad girl of rock and roll Ronnie Spector, rock singer Jackie Lomax, the Modern Jazz Quartet, and London's Radha Krishna Temple. Since Apple's inception, McCartney and Lennon had been very interested in launching a budget-line label to issue what would essentially be known three decades later as \\"audio books\\". In October 1968, Apple hired Barry Miles, who co-owned the Indica bookshop with John Dunbar and Peter Asher, to manage the proposed spoken-word label. The initial idea of Zapple Records was that it would release avant-garde and spoken word records at a reduced price that would be comparable to that of a paperback novel. While the idea looked good on paper, the reality was that when the few records actually put out by Zapple finally made it into the shops, they were priced like any other full- priced music album.Granados, S. Those Were the Days. p. 76 Zapple Records was started on 3 February 1969, but after Klein was brought in to run Apple Corps' affairs, it was closed down after just two releases: Lennon and Ono's Unfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions, and Harrison's Electronic Sound. Apple Retail The Apple Boutique was a retail store, located at 94 Baker Street in London, and was one of the first business ventures by Apple Corps. Lennon's schoolfriend Pete Shotton was hired as manager, and the Dutch design collective The Fool were brought in to design the store and much of the merchandise. The store opened to much fanfare on 7 December 1967, with Lennon and Harrison attending (Starr was filming, and McCartney was on holiday). The boutique was never profitable, largely due to shoplifting, by customers and its own staff. After Shotton resigned, John Lyndon took over but his management experience could not save the enterprise. The store's remaining stock was liquidated by giving it away, after the individual Beatles had taken whatever they liked the night before its closure. The boutique closed its doors on 31 July 1968. Apple Studios Apple Studios in 1971 Apple Studio was a recording studio, located in the basement of the Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row. The facility was renamed Apple Studios after its expansion in 1971. Originally designed by Alex Mardas, of Apple Electronics, the initial installation proved to be unworkable ‚àí with almost no standard studio features such as a patch bay, or a talkback system between the studio and the control room, let alone Mardas' promised innovations ‚àí and had to be scrapped. Nevertheless, the Beatles recorded and filmed portions of their album Let It Be in the Apple Studio, with equipment borrowed from EMI; during takes they had to shut down the building's central heating, also located in the basement, because the lack of soundproofing allowed the heating system to be heard in the studio. The redesign and rebuilding of the basement to accommodate proper recording facilities was overseen by former EMI engineer Geoff Emerick, and took eighteen months at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. Beatles' technical engineer Claude Harper aided on the project, as well.Apple US press release for Lon & Derrek Van Eaton's Brother album, September 1972. Retrieved 24 February 2012, The studio reopened on 30 September 1971 and now included its own natural echo chamber, a wide range of recording and mastering facilities, and could turn out mono, stereo and quadrophonic master tapes and discs. In 1971, it would have cost ¬£37 an hour (equivalent to ¬£ in ) to record to 16-track, ¬£29 an hour (equivalent to ¬£ in ) to mix to stereo, and ¬£12 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) to cut a 12\\" master. George Harrison attended the launch party, along with Pete Ham of Badfinger and Klaus Voormann.Keith Badman, The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970‚Äì2001, Omnibus Press (London, 2001), p. 50. The studio became a second home for Apple Records artists, although they also used Abbey Road and other studios in London, including Trident Studios, AIR Studios, Morgan Studios and Olympic Studios or elsewhere. The only Beatle solo release to use Apple Studio for a significant portion of its production was Harrison's Living in the Material World album of 1973, yet most of the recording is thought to have taken place at his impressive Friar Park studio.Simon Leng, While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Music of George Harrison, Hal Leonard (Milwaukee, WI, 2006), p. 126. The first projects to be carried out there after the re-opening were the recording of Lon & Derrek Van Eaton's Brother album, and overdubbing and mixing on Badfinger's Straight Up.Badman, The Beatles Diary Volume 2, p. 50. Other artists such as Harry Nilsson, Nicky Hopkins, Wishbone Ash, Viv Stanshall, Stealers Wheel, Lou Reizner, Clodagh Rodgers and Marc Bolan (as shown in the movie Born To Boogie) also worked there. Apple Studio was closed down for good on 16 May 1975. Legal battles Apple Corps v. Apple Computer In 1978, Apple Records filed suit against Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) for trademark infringement. The suit was settled in 1981 with the payment of $80,000 to Apple Corps. As a condition of the settlement, Apple Computer agreed to stay out of the music business. A dispute subsequently arose in 1989 when Apple Corps sued, alleging that Apple Computer's machines' ability to play back MIDI music was a violation of the 1981 settlement agreement. In 1991 another settlement, of around $26.5 million, was reached. In September 2003, Apple Computer was again sued by Apple Corps, this time for introducing the iTunes Music Store and the iPod, which Apple Corps asserted was a violation of Apple's agreement not to distribute music. The trial opened on 29 March 2006 in the UK, and in a judgement issued on 8 May 2006, Apple Corps lost the case. On 5 February 2007, Apple Inc. and Apple Corps announced a settlement of their trademark dispute under which Apple Inc. took ownership of all of the trademarks related to \\"Apple\\" (including all designs of the famed \\"Granny Smith\\" Apple Corps Ltd. logos), and will license certain of those trademarks back to Apple Corps for their continued use. The settlement ends the ongoing trademark lawsuit between the companies, with each party bearing its own legal costs, and Apple Inc. will continue using its name and logos on iTunes. The settlement includes terms that are confidential. The website for Harmonix's The Beatles: Rock Band video game is notable as the first evidence of the Apple, Inc./Apple Corps Ltd. settlement: \\"Apple Corps\\" is prominently referred to throughout, and the \\"Granny Smith\\" Apple logo appears but the text beneath the logo now reads \\"Apple Corps\\" rather than the previous \\"Apple\\". The website's acknowledgements specifically state that \\"'Apple' and the 'Apple logo' are exclusively licensed to Apple Corps Ltd\\". On 16 November 2010, Apple Inc. launched an extensive advertising campaign that announced the availability of the Beatles' entire catalogue in the iTunes Store. Apple versus EMI The Beatles alleged in a 1979 lawsuit that EMI and Capitol had underpaid the band by more than ¬£10.5 million. A settlement was reached in that case in 1989, which granted the band an increased royalty rate and required EMI and Capitol to follow more stringent auditing requirements. Apple, on behalf of the surviving Beatles and relatives of the band's late members, again sued EMI for unpaid royalties, in a case beginning in 2005. The case was settled in April 2007 with a \\"mutually acceptable\\" conclusion, which remained confidential. Apple versus Nike/EMI In July 1987, Apple Corps sued Nike Inc, Wieden+Kennedy (Nike's advertisement agency), EMI and Capitol Records for the use of the song \\"Revolution\\" in a 1987 Nike commercial. Apple claimed that it was not informed of the use of the song and was not paid for continued use and therefore sued the four companies for $15 million. EMI countered stating that the case was \\"groundless\\" to their claim they had the \\"active support and encouragement of Yoko Ono Lennon\\", who owns 25% of Apple Corps through Lennon's estate, and was quoted as saying: \\"[The commercial] is making John‚Äôs music accessible to a new generation\\". Apple's lawyer responded by stating that Apple cannot take action unless all four shares are in agreement, meaning that Ono must have supported the idea to take legal action at the moment when the decision was made. Harrison had the following to say about the unauthorised use of Beatles songs for advertisement as well as the importance of this particular case: On 9 November 1989, the lawsuit was settled out of court. As with previous cases between Apple and EMI, a condition of the settlement was that terms of the agreement would be kept secret. It was suggested, however, by a spokesman of Ono that in the end of a very \\"confusing myriad of issues\\" there was a large exchange of money. Nike had also ceased to use the song for advertisement in March 1988.

It has a population of 10,008 according to the 2016 census. It is the biggest town in the county and about one third of the county's population lives there. Longford lies at the meeting of Ireland's N4 and N5 National Primary Route roads, which means that traffic traveling between Dublin and County Mayo, or north County Roscommon passes around the town. Longford railway station, on the Dublin-Sligo line, is used heavily by commuters. History The town is built on the banks of the River Camlin (), which is a tributary of the River Shannon. The name Longford is an Anglicization of the Irish Longphort, from long (meaning \\"ship\\") and port (meaning \\"port\\" or \\"dock\\"). This name was applied to many Irish settlements of Viking origin and eventually came to mean fort or camp in the Irish language, and so Longfort the modern Irish spelling, is the name of this town, which was one of the only Gaelic Irish market towns to arise without first being founded by Vikings or Normans. The area came under the sway of the local clan which controlled the south and middle of the County of Longford (historically called Anghaile or ) and hence, the town is sometimes called Longfort U√≠ Fhearghail (fort/stronghold of O'Farrell). A Dominican priory was founded there in 1400. St. John's Church of Ireland (formerly known as Templemichael Parish Church) was built on the site of the priory in 1710. Places of interest The Corlea Trackway Visitor Centre is located near to Longford, in Keenagh. The Centre houses an Iron Age bog road which was built in 148 BC across the boglands in proximity to the River Shannon. The oak road is the largest of its kind to have been uncovered in Europe and was excavated over the years by Professor Barry Raftery of University College Dublin. Inside the building, an 18-metre stretch of preserved road is on permanent display in a specially designed hall with humidifiers to prevent the ancient wood from cracking in the heat. Bord na Mona and the Heritage Service have carried out conservation work on the surrounding bog to ensure that it remains wet and that the buried road is preserved. There are other historical artifacts and some exhibits at the centre. Longford Railway Station St. Mel's Cathedral in the town features several stained glass windows by Harry Clarke studios. These include one of his earliest works The consecration of St. Mel as Bishop of Longford which was exhibited at the RDS Annual Art Industries Exhibition in 1910, where it received second prize. It was also exhibited at The Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland fourth exhibition in the same year. The Cathedral was extensively damaged in a fire on Christmas Day 2009. St. Mel's Cathedral remained closed for exactly five years following the fire while it was the centre of one of the largest restoration projects undertaken in Europe. It reopened for services at midnight mass on Christmas Eve 2014 and has since become a significant tourist attraction. The two most intricated stained-glass windows in the transepts of the Cathedral have been faithfully restored ‚Äì these depict St Anne and the Resurrection. Longford town boasts a state-of-the-art 212-seat theatre called Backstage Theatre just outside of the town, and a four-screen multiplex cinema, with restaurants. The mix and quality of housing is extensive and the Rural Renewal Hi Scheme (1999‚Äì2006) has ensured that a steady supply of residential development has come about. Longford town has a decentralized government department which employs approximately 300 people and a further 130 are employed at the Irish Prison Service's headquarters in the Lisamuck area of the town. The Prison Service HQ boasts a sculpture by renowned artist Remco de Fou which, apart from the Spire in Dublin is the largest piece of sculpture in Ireland. Connolly Barracks once employed approximately 180 soldiers, many of whom were involved in UN peace-keeping duties, until the barracks closed in January 2009. The town serves as the cathedral town of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise. St Mel's Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Mel, the founder of the diocese of Ardagh, was designed by architect John Benjamin Keane, who also designed St Francis Xavier's Church on Gardiner Street in Dublin. There are a number of portal dolmens located around Longford. Economy Longford Chamber of Commerce Longford's main industries are food production, sawmills, steelworking, generator retailing, cable making and the production of medical diagnostics. It is the major services centre for the county as well as the location of the Department of Social Welfare and the Irish Prison Service. The town is also a local commercial centre, with many retail outlets including multiples such as Tesco, Argos and Homestore and more, German discount retailers, Aldi and Lidl and Irish retail outlets such as Dunnes Stores and Penneys. Up until 2007, construction was a major local employer, mainly due to government tax breaks for property development provided under the Rural Renewal scheme. However the downturn in the construction industry, the withdrawal of Rural Renewal, and extensive local oversupply of property has caused large job losses in the construction industry and a significant increase in unemployment in the region. Education Longford town has a number of primary schools (for ages 4‚Äì12) and three secondary schools (for ages 12‚Äì19): two single-sex schools, St. Mel's College, (a Catholic boys' school) and Scoil Mhuire (a Catholic girls' school run by the Sisters of Mercy), as well as a mixed school, (Templemichael College, formerly known as Longford Vocational School). Primary schools in Longford include a Gaelscoil and St. Joseph's. An extensive adult education centre exists in Longford. St. Mel's College is the oldest and best- known of these schools, being founded approximately 150 years ago by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnois as a diocesan seminary to train students for the priesthood. While the school only briefly functioned as a seminary, it served for many years as a boarding school, while also admitting day students. The boarding school was discontinued after 2000 and the school is now only a day school, with the largest student enrolment in county Longford. The College, known locally as Mel's, is best known for its strict rules of conduct and its success on a national level with Gaelic football, athletics, soccer, basketball and Rugby. Transport Road Longford is at the point of divergence of the N5 road to Castlebar/Westport/Ireland West Airport Knock and the N4 road which continues onwards to Sligo. N5 road used to go through the town & there was a little traffic congestion except at peak times and this is mainly due to the traffic system of the town which has a number of one-way streets and traffic signals before N5 Longford bypass which was opened on 3 August 2012. The N4 Sligo road has a bypass around the town, which consists of single carriageway with hard shoulders and four roundabouts. It was opened on 2 June 1995 and constitutes part of the planned Longford Ring Road which will encircle the town when completed. Railway Longford is about from Sligo and from Dublin. It lies on the Dublin-Sligo line of the Irish railway network, and is served by Sligo-Dublin intercity services. Despite its distance from Dublin, the town also has a regular, well-utilised commuter service to Dublin. Journeys to Dublin Connolly by rail generally take about an hour and three-quarters. Longford railway station opened on 8 November 1855. Canals The Royal Canal reopened in October 2010 after years of being derelict and overgrown. Navigation is now possible from Spencer Dock, in Dublin, to the Shannon, in Clondra. Bus There are a large number of bus services to Dublin and other towns both outside and inside the county provided by both the state (Bus √âireann) and private bus companies (Kane's, Donnelly's and Farrelly's.) Third level colleges are well served by the private companies during the academic year. Donnelly's Pioneer Bus Service, a longstanding local bus company based in Granard, operate a route from Longford to Granard via Ballinalee. There are three journeys each way daily (no Sunday service). Whartons Travel, which is also a longstanding local bus service, operate a route from Longford railway station and Longford to Cavan via Drumlish, Arvagh and Crossdoney. As of 2014, this service is funded by the National Transport Authority. Air Longford's main air transport centre is located south-east of the town, at Abbeyshrule, the local airport. Abbeyshrule Aerodrome receives a regular influx of small general aviation aircraft, including the Cessna 182 and 150. The airport also boasts two flight training centres; one for general aviation fixed wing aircraft training (Aeroclub 2000) and one for microlight aircraft flight training (Ultraflight). The airport is also the home of the Extra 200 aerobatic aircraft EI-SAM of acclaimed Irish international competition aerobatics pilot David Bruton. Arts and Culture The Backstage Theatre and Centre for the Arts is a major facility for arts and culture projects in the town and surrounding areas. It is funded by Longford County Council with support from the Arts Council. Backstage is a member of two arts touring networks: Nasc a nationwide network of seven venues and Nomad a north midlands based network. Through these networks the theatre has been able to bring major productions to the town. Sport The town has a wide range of sports clubs and facilities including the Gaelic Athletic Association, rugby and tennis clubs, a League of Ireland soccer club, two indoor swimming pools, an extensive gym and an 18-hole golf course. A new swimming pool was opened in Longford in 2007. Gaelic football and hurling The sport with most support in County Longford is Gaelic football. The headquarters of the Longford Gaelic Athletic Association is located in Pearse Park in Longford Town, with a ground capacity of around 11,000. The Longford Gaelic football team has been relatively unsuccessful at national level, in large part reflecting the county's small population size ‚Äì although it succeeded in winning a Leinster title at Senior level in 1968 and a National League title in 1966. The minor (under-18) Longford county team won the Leinster title in 2002, and recently in 2010, and their teams at under-21 level have reached several Leinster finals over the last few years (including 2006). The major boys' secondary school in Longford town, St. Mel's College, also has a long tradition in secondary schools' football (known as Colleges A), winning 29 Leinster and 4 All-Ireland titles (in the Hogan Cup). At one stage, St. Mel's College had won more Leinster titles than all of the other Leinster colleges put together. The main local GAA Club in Longford is Longford Slashers, based in Longford town, who have won more Senior County Championships(16) than any other team in the county with their most recent success coming in 2013. County Longford boasted arguably the best Gaelic football team which did not win the Sam Maguire Cup in 1968. The team was narrowly beaten by Kerry in the all-Ireland Semi final. The recently deceased T.D. John Wilson and G.A.A. all-Ireland medalist (with County Cavan) starred with St. Mel's College Gaelic football team. St. Mel's also boasted a cricket team which wore all black rig. St. Mel's holds the peculiar distinction: in the 1966/67 season it held two teams scoreless in Gaelic football. This feat has never been equalled by any other Gaelic football team in history. Longford Hurling Team struggle to compete with the bigger counties as they only have three hurling teams in the county, Slashers, Wolfe Tones and Clonguish. The county team won the National League Division 3 title in 2002, In 2005 & 2006 they won the Leinster Shield. They won the Lory Meagher Cup, for the first time, in Croke Park on 3 July 2010 and won on a score line of Longford 1 ‚Äì 20 to Donegal 1 ‚Äì 12. Soccer Longford town itself has a strong tradition in soccer, the game being introduced in the late 19th century. The town was a military base garrison when Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom. Longford Town football club was founded in 1924 and was elected to the League of Ireland in 1984. The first Longford town football club team to play in the League of Ireland featured Jimmy Savage, Zac Hackett and Liam Madden. In the 1950s and 60s, Longford boasted such players as Willie Browne (UCD and Bohemian FC) who won 3 full international Republic of Ireland caps and captained Bohemian FC for 3 consecutive seasons, he made 177 appearances for Bohs in all competitions scoring 20 goals, Lal Donlon (Longford town and Arsenal), Mel 'Garrincha' Mulligan, John 'Hooky' O'Connor and the legendary Billy Clarke. Billy Clarke is arguably Longford's most famous football player to date. The Longford Town football club ground is at City Calling Stadium, in the townland of Mullolagher, to the west of the town, on the Strokestown Road. Previously, the club was based in the north of Abbeycarton town. The Longford Town football club has had notable success in recent years, twice winning the FAI Cup, in 2003 and 2004, and competing in the UEFA Cup as a result against Bulgarian, Liechtenstein and Welsh opposition, though without success. Other sports For golfers, Longford has an extensive parkland course. Also within a 50 km (30 mi) radius of the county, one can play quality championship courses such as the Nick Faldo-designed Lough Rynn, Glassan and the Slieve Russell. Longford is represented in basketball by two clubs. Torpedo's were formed in 1973 and have competed in the Meath, Cavan, Mid-lands and National leagues. The club have been very successful over the years and recently represented Longford in the Flanders Basketball Tournament in Ghent, Belgium. They now play in the Shannon Side League in Men's and North East League in Ladies'. Ladies and Men's teams play home games in Edgeworthstown. They hold an annual tournament at the end September start of October each season with 16 teams from all over Ireland and the UK entering. The second club which was a break away unit of the Torpedo's are Longford Falcons. The club has had numerous Leinster and national titles won at the junior level. The club is based at the Mall Sports Complex, in the east of the town. Longford town also hosts rugby club, Longford RFC whose grounds are located at Demesne, in the north of the town, and who participate in the Leinster League. Longford has an extensive sports complex/amenity, known locally as The Mall. The complex contains a swimming pool, gym, both indoor and outdoor football and basketball grounds and there is also new outdoor gym equipment all around the mall. The Mall itself is a popular walking spot in the town, a lap of which is approximately 2 km.

He is considered one of the founders of structural functionalism in linguistics. Mathesius was the editor-in-chief of two linguistic journals, Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Prague (‚ÄúWorks of the Prague Linguistic Circle‚Äù) and Slovo a slovesnost (\\"Word and Verbal Art\\"), and the co-founder of a third, Nov√© Athenaeum. His extensive publications in these journals and elsewhere cover a range of topics, including the history of English literature, syntax, Czech stylistics, and cultural activism. In addition to his work in linguistics, in 1912 he founded the department of English philology at Charles University, which was the first such department in Czechoslovakia. He remained head of the department until 1939, when the Nazis closed all Czech universities. The department now exists as a branch of the Faculty of Arts, but it is called the \\"Department of Anglophone Literatures and Cultures.\\"  Personal life and education  Vil√©m was born as the youngest of two sons of Bed≈ôich and Evelina Mathesius. His father was a wealthy tanner in a long line of tanners of Saxon origin, claiming Martin Luther's biographer Johannes Mathesius as an ancestor. His cousin, Bohumil Mathesius, was a poet and translator. Vil√©m was born in Pardubice, a city in Eastern Bohemia (in the present-day Czech Republic, then part of the Austrio-Hungarian Empire). When he was 11 his family moved west to Kol√≠n, a town near Prague. There he attended a classic gymn√°zium and took particular interest in the study of language, taking classes in Latin, Greek, German, and French, in addition to his native language of Czech. He also taught himself some Italian and Russian, and met with the pastor ƒåenƒõk Du≈°ek for private lessons in English. Du≈°ek also instructed Mathesius in Calvinism, the religion which Mathesius actively and devotedly practiced his whole life. In 1901, Mathesius began his studies of Germanic and Romance philology under the Neogrammarian Jan Gebauer at Charles University in Prague, earning both his B.A. and his PhD there. The topic of his doctoral dissertation, which he submitted in 1907, was Hippolyte Taine's criticism of Shakespeare. While serving as an assistant teacher of German at a secondary school in Plze≈à, he wrote his habilitation thesis and submitted it in 1909. He spent the next 3 years working at Charles University as a privatdozent, then in 1912 he was appointed the university's first professor of Anglistics (English philology), effectively founding the department. He remained head of the department until Charles University, along with all other Czech universities, was forcibly shut down by the Nazis on November 17, 1939. In 1908 Mathesius married R≈Ø≈æena Moravcov√° with whom he later had a son, Vil√©m (known as Vil√≠k). Moravcov√° died unexpectedly in 1933 during a routine operation. Soon after, Mathesius married her sister, Antonia. Mathesius suffered a number of health problems during his lifetime. In 1922 he contracted an eye disease that eventually left him completely blind. This caused him to rely increasingly on his students, including Ren√© Wellek and Bohumil Trnka, to assist him in his teaching, reading, and writing. Ten years later, in 1932, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the vertebrae, which caused him to be bed-ridden for a year and a half (1932‚Äì33). In spite of these ailments, he continued to pursue his studies, teach his classes, and work with the Prague Circle, until his death in Prague on 12 April 1945.  Work with the Prague Circle  Mathesius first met Roman Jakobson, an influential Russian linguist and co-founder of the Moscow Linguistic Circle, soon after Jakobson's arrival in Prague in 1920. It was Jakobson who pointed out the need for a center for work and discussion for young linguists in the city, which coincided with Mathesius's patriotic desire to improve the state of scholarship in Czechoslovakia. However, their plans would not be realized for half a decade. For a year and a half (March 1925 ‚Äì October 1926), Mathesius hosted the sporadic and informal gatherings of young linguists that eventually became the Prague Linguistic Circle at his own house. The first official meeting took place on October 6, 1926, at Mathesius's office. Henrik Becker, a young German linguist, was the first speaker invited to give a lecture, which was attended by five people (including Mathesius and Jakobson) and followed by a discussion. The Circle applied for official status in 1930, and Mathesius, as a senior member and well-established academic, served as its president. The Circle achieved international notice at two linguistic conferences: the First International Congress of Linguists at the Hague in 1928, then the First International Congress of Slavists in Prague in 1929. They used these conferences as an opportunity to develop and present a set of ten theses for linguistic research, promoting a \\"functionalist\\" approach to the study of language. Soon after the Prague Congress they issued their first independent publication, two volumes of the journal Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Prague (\\"Works of the Prague Linguistic Circle\\"), of which Mathesius was the editor-in-chief. In addition, in 1936 the Circle began issuing a Czech periodical called Slovo a slovesnost (\\"Word and verbal art\\"), also with Mathesius as editor-in-chief. Publication of Travaux ceased in 1939 due to the onset of World War II, but the journal began to be reissued in 1995 as part of a general effort to revive the Circle. Slovo a slovesnost, which specializes in structuralist theory and Czech language, continues (after a brief hiatus from 1942 to 1947) to be published as a quarterly.  Scholarship  Mathesius's scholarly work is typically divided into three periods based on his academic and intellectual focus and his increasing interest in linguistic concerns.  Literary History (1910‚Äì1926)  During the beginning of his career, Mathesius's interests were split between literary history and linguistics. He started to assemble a compendium of the history of English literature and managed to publish two volumes (1910‚Äì1915) before the loss of his eyesight cut his work short. The works, which cover the Anglo-Saxon period through the late Middle Ages, were foundational in establishing the Anglistics department at the university. He also wrote a number of articles on Shakespeare and his critics in 1916, the year of Shakespeare's Jubilee. Alongside his work with literature, he began exploring linguistic theory and questioning the Neogrammarian emphasis on diachronic, or historical, linguistics that defined the study of language at his time. In 1911 he presented one of his more famous lectures to the Royal Learned Society, \\"On the potentiality of the language phenomenon\\", which anticipates Ferdinand de Saussure's critical distinction between langue and parole (1916) and emphasizes the importance of the synchronic (in his words, \\"static\\") study of language.  The Founding of the Circle (1926‚Äì1936)  In his second period of intellectual development, which coincided with the first decade of the Prague Linguistic Circle, Mathesius explored the nature of syntax and semantics and also contributed to the Circle's work on phonology, introducing the ideas of functional load and combining capacity of phonemes. This is also the point at which he began to develop his idea of functionalism in contrast to Saussurean structuralism.  Linguistic Functionalism (1936‚Äì1945)  The third and final period of Mathesius's work, which lasted until his death, was devoted to functionalist theories of grammar. He was a leading proponent of this school of thought, although he credits the followers of the Polish linguist Jan Baudouin de Courtenay and the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen with having sowed the seeds of the movement. Mathesius built up functionalism as an alternative to the approach of the Neogrammarians, which he criticized as failing to view language as a whole system, overly emphasizing written language at the expense of spoken, and neglecting the role of the speaker/writer in the production of language. Functionalism remedied these problems, and it also preferred synchronic study over diachronic and favored an analytic approach over a genealogical one. During this time period, Mathesius also became more concerned with issues of stylistics, such as rhythm and intonation, in both Czech and English. The total loss of his eyesight caused him to focus his attention on these aspects of spoken language, because spoken language was now more easily accessible to him. Throughout his scholarly career and particularly after the Nazi takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Mathesius advocated for cultural activism, as defined by the first president of Czechoslovakia, T. G. Masaryk. In Mathesius's mind, cultural activism entailed the revitalization of the Czech national spirit and reform of national holidays, among other things. He published two major collections on the topic: Kulturn√≠ aktivismus (\\"Cultural Activism\\") in 1925, and Co daly na≈°e zemƒõ Evropƒõ a lidstvu (\\"What Our Lands Contributed to Europe and Mankind\\") in 1940.  Legacy  Mathesius's ideas on linguistic functionalism remained central to the work of the Prague Linguistic Circle and have been expanded upon by modern linguists in many directions. Linguistic approaches to information structure, including Functional Sentence Perspective and the topic-comment dichotomy, have grown out of Mathesius's writings through the work of Jan Firbas, Franti≈°ek Dane≈°, Petr Sgall, and Eva Hajiƒçov√°. Mathesius's ideas also influenced Michael Halliday's development of systemic functional grammar. Critics maintain that Mathesius lacked refined methodology, and that his observations of data could not amount to much because of his reluctance to propose unified theories to account for them. His work never achieved the international renown of that of his colleagues, possibly because he wrote almost exclusively in Czech. Mathesius's brainchild, the Prague Circle, did much to elevate and improve Prague's reputation in the academic world and bring it to international attention. Reflecting on the first ten years of the Circle, Mathesius summed up their contributions: \\"In foreign linguistics we fought for and won for our group the respectful title of the 'Prague School,' while at home, nobody can, without ill will, deny us the merit of having given many fresh impulses to Czech linguistic and literary research by our new standpoint and our new methods of work.\\" Although the Circle dissolved in 1949 due to internal political tension, it was revived in 1989 and now works to publish journals, host conferences, and promote academic work in language and linguistics. Mathesius is memorialized at Charles University by the Vil√©m Mathesius Centre for Research and Education in Semiotics and Linguistics and by the Vil√©m Mathesius Foundation for the Promotion of English and American Studies in Prague, which issues annual awards for the best MA and BA theses in the Department of English and American Studies.

ACM CHI (Computer Human Interaction). May 5‚Äì10, 2012. Austin Texas. Overview Collaborative intelligence is a term used in several disciplines. In business it describes heterogeneous networks of people interacting to produce intelligent outcomes. It can also denote non-autonomous multi-agent problem-solving systems. The term was used in 1999 to describe the behavior of an intelligent business \\"ecosystem\\" where Collaborative Intelligence, or CQ, is \\"the ability to build, contribute to and manage power found in networks of people.\\" When the computer science community adopted the term collective intelligence and gave that term a specific technical denotation, a complementary term was needed to distinguish between anonymous homogeneity in collective prediction systems and non-anonymous heterogeneity in collaborative problem-solving systems. Anonymous collective intelligence was then complemented by collaborative intelligence, which acknowledged identity, viewing social networks as the foundation for next generation problem-solving ecosystems, modeled on evolutionary adaptation in nature's ecosystems. History Collaborative intelligence traces its roots to the Pandemonium Architecture proposed by artificial intelligence pioneer Oliver Selfridge as a paradigm for learning.Selfridge, O. (1959) Pandemonium: A paradigm for learning. Symposium on the mechanization of thought processes. London: H.M. Stationery Office His concept was a precursor for the blackboard system where an opportunistic solution space, or blackboard, draws from a range of partitioned knowledge sources, as multiple players assemble a jigsaw puzzle, each contributing a piece. Rodney Brooks notes that the blackboard model specifies how knowledge is posted to a blackboard for general sharing, but not how knowledge is retrieved, typically hiding from the consumer of knowledge who originally produced which knowledge,Brooks, R.A., (1991). Intelligence without representation, Artificial Intelligence 47, 139‚Äì159 so it would not qualify as a collaborative intelligence system. In the late 1980s, Eshel Ben-Jacob began to study bacterial self-organization, believing that bacteria hold the key to understanding larger biological systems. He developed new pattern-forming bacteria species, Paenibacillus vortex and Paenibacillus dendritiformis, and became a pioneer in the study of social behaviors of bacteria. P. dendritiformis manifests a collective faculty, which could be viewed as a precursor of collaborative intelligence, the ability to switch between different morphotypes to adapt with the environment.Ben-Jacob E, Cohen I, Gutnick DL. Cooperative organization of bacterial colonies: from genotype to morphotype. Annu Rev Microbiol. 1998;52:779-806.Ben-Jacob E, Cohen I. Cooperative formation of bacterial patterns. In: Shapiro JA, Dworkin M, eds. Bacteria as Multicellular Organisms. New York: Oxford University Press; 1997:394-416. Ants were first characterized by entomologist W. M. Wheeler as cells of a single \\"superorganism\\" where seemingly independent individuals can cooperate so closely as to become indistinguishable from a single organism.Wheeler, W. M. (1911) The Ant-Colony as an Organism. Journal of Morphology 22: 307-325. Later research characterized some insect colonies as instances of collective intelligence. The concept of ant colony optimization algorithms, introduced by Marco Dorigo, became a dominant theory of evolutionary computation. The mechanisms of evolution through which species adapt toward increased functional effectiveness in their ecosystems are the foundation for principles of collaborative intelligence. Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) is a real-time technology that enables networked human groups to efficiently combine their knowledge, wisdom, insights, and intuitions into an emergent intelligence. Sometimes referred to as a \\"hive mind,\\" the first real-time human swarms were deployed by Unanimous A.I. using a cloud-based server called \\"UNU\\" in 2014. It enables online groups to answer questions, reach decisions, and make predictions by thinking together as a unified intelligence. This process has been shown to produce significantly improved decisions, predictions, estimations, and forecasts, as demonstrated when predicting major events such as the Kentucky Derby, the Oscars, the Stanley Cup, Presidential Elections, and the World Series. Crowdsourcing evolved from anonymous collective intelligence and is evolving toward credited, open source, collaborative intelligence applications that harness social networks. Evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr noted that competition among individuals would not contribute to species evolution if individuals were typologically identical. Individual differences are a prerequisite for evolution.Mayr, E. (1988). Toward a New Philosophy of Biology: Observations of an Evolutionist. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press. pp. 224‚Äì225 This evolutionary principle corresponds to the principle of collaborative autonomy in collaborative intelligence, which is a prerequisite for next generation platforms for crowd-sourcing. Following are examples of crowdsourced experiments with attributes of collaborative intelligence: * SwarmSketch is a crowd-sourced art experiment. * Galaxy Zoo is a citizen science project led by Chris Lintott at Oxford University to tap human pattern recognition capacities to catalog galaxies. * DARPA Network Challenge explores how the Internet and social networking can support timely communication, wide-area team-building, and urgent mobilization to solve broad-scope, time-critical problems. * Climate CoLab, spun out of MIT and its Center for Collective Intelligence. * reCAPTCHA is a project to digitize books, one word at a time As crowdsourcing evolves from basic pattern recognition tasks to toward collaborative intelligence, tapping the unique expertise of individual contributors in social networks, constraints guide evolution toward increased functional effectiveness, co-evolving with systems to tag, credit, time-stamp, and sort content.Gill, Zann (2011) Algorithmic implications of evo-devo debates. GECCO 2011. International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (combining the 20th International Conference on Genetic Algorithms ICGA and the 16th Annual Genetic Programming Conference. July 12‚Äì16. Dublin, Ireland. Collaborative intelligence requires capacity for effective search, discovery, integration, visualization, and frameworks to support collaborative problem- solving.Collaborative Intelligence Resources Contrast with collective intelligence The term collective intelligence originally encompassed both collective and collaborative intelligence, and many systems manifest attributes of both. Pierre L√©vy coined the term \\"collective intelligence\\" in his book of that title, first published in French in 1994.L√©vy P. (1994) L'Intelligence collective: Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace. Paris: La D√©couverte. L√©vy defined \\"collective intelligence\\" to encompass both collective and collaborative intelligence: \\"a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and in the effective mobilization of skills\\".L√©vy, P. (1997) Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace. New York: Plenum Press Following publication of L√©vy's book, computer scientists adopted the term collective intelligence to denote an application within the more general area to which this term now applies in computer science. Specifically, an application that processes input from a large number of discrete responders to specific, generally quantitative, questions (e.g. what will the price of DRAM be next year?) Algorithms homogenize input, maintaining the traditional anonymity of survey responders to generate better-than-average predictions. Recent dependency network studies suggest links between collective and collaborative intelligence. Partial correlation-based Dependency Networks, a new class of correlation-based networks, have been shown to uncover hidden relationships between the nodes of the network. Research by Dror Y. Kenett and his Ph.D. supervisor Eshel Ben-Jacob uncovered hidden information about the underlying structure of the U.S. stock market that was not present in the standard correlation networks, and published their findings in 2011.Kenett et al. (2010) PLoS ONE 5(12): e15032 Application Collaborative intelligence addresses problems where individual expertise, potentially conflicting priorities of stakeholders, and different interpretations of diverse experts are critical for problem-solving. Potential future applications include: * competitions, where submissions must be integrated to produce a synergistic outcome; * smart search, where social networks of searchers on related topics co-define search results; * professional groups, interest collectives, citizen science and other communities, where knowledge-sharing is a prerequisite for effective outcomes; * planning, development, and sustainable project management; * smart systems to transform independent cities into collaborative, ecological urban networks Wikipedia, one of the most popular websites on the Internet, is an exemplar of an innovation network manifesting distributed collaborative intelligence that illustrates principles for experimental business laboratories and start-up accelerators.Gill, Zann (2013).

The Experimental Nature of Venture Creation: Capitalizing on Open Innovation 2.0. NY: Springer. A new generation of tools to support collaborative intelligence is poised to evolve from crowdsourcing platforms, recommender systems, and evolutionary computation. Existing tools to facilitate group problem-solving include collaborative groupware, synchronous conferencing technologies such as instant messaging, online chat, and shared white boards, which are complemented by asynchronous messaging like electronic mail, threaded, moderated discussion forums, web logs, and group Wikis. Managing the Intelligent Enterprise relies on these tools, as well as methods for group member interaction; promotion of creative thinking; group membership feedback; quality control and peer review; and a documented group memory or knowledge base.Information and Collaboration Technologies (Chapter 5): Managing Collective Intelligence, Toward a New Corporate Governance As groups work together, they develop a shared memory, which is accessible through the collaborative artifacts created by the group, including meeting minutes, transcripts from threaded discussions, and drawings. The shared memory (group memory) is also accessible through the memories of group members; current interest focuses on how technology can support and augment the effectiveness of shared past memory and capacity for future problem-solving.

Frank Baum.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 239-40. He first appears in the book The Marvelous Land of Oz in 1904. He goes by the name H. M. Woggle-Bug, T.E. (Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated). In later books, the hyphen was sometimes dropped: \\"Wogglebug\\". In illustrations, he is often depicted wearing bright colors and several pairs of glasses on his elongated proboscis. History According to The Marvelous Land of Oz, the Woggle-Bug was once a regular tiny woggle-bug, about the size of a pea. He lived the life of a normal insect until he crawled into a country schoolhouse (presumably somewhere in the Winkie Country of the Land of Oz) and listened to the lessons and lectures the famous Professor Nowitall gave his pupils for about three years. One day the teacher found and caught him, and decided to use him for an impromptu lesson on woggle-bugs. Nowitall put the bug under a microscope and projected his highly magnified image onto a screen with advanced technology. The bug was proud of his new size; he bowed to the students, and one unnamed little girl standing on the windowsill was startled and fell backward out of the window. While everyone rushed outside to see if she was all right, the bug secretly jumped off the screen and ran away. He has remained magnified ever since. Later he found a tailor, and after he saved the tailor's life in an unknown way (although a few stories have been written to explain how, including The Wogglebug's New Clothes in the 1987 Oziana), the tailor made him his very first clothes. He later founded and runs the Royal College of Art and Athletic Perfection, also known as the Royal College of Athletic Arts or the Royal College of Athletic Sciences, which is located in the western part of the Munchkin Country, not far from the Emerald City. He also invented knowledge pills that give a student knowledge without having to attend lessons, so that the student's time can be applied to athletic pursuits. In Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, Woggle-Bug appears as the prosecutor in Princess Ozma's court. In The Road to Oz, Woggle-Bug is among the guests at Princess Ozma's birthday party. Personality When the Woggle-bug is first introduced in The Marvelous Land of Oz, he is portrayed as having a charming disposition and a quirky and somewhat eccentric personality. He has a love of big words, Latin phrases, philosophy, and colorful puns relating to his immediate situation (\\"Were I to ride upon this sawhorse he would not only be an animal, he would become an equipage for he would then be a horse and buggy\\"). These puns cause his companions a great deal of distress, in response to the aforementioned pun, \\"[T]he Scarecrow gave a gasp and the Tin Woodman stopped short and looked reproachfully at the Woggle-Bug. At the same time the Sawhorse loudly snorted in derision; and even the Pumpkinhead put up his hand to hide the smile, which because it was carved upon his face, he could not change to a frown.\\" Puns have been regarded as a sign of superior education and Baum uses the Woggle-Bug's puns repeatedly to highlight his conceitedness regarding his own education. Later the Tinman even threatens to murder the Woggle-Bug if he does not stop using his puns to show off. He is very proud of his education, and wants to put it to good use. He is always courteous and polite whatever the situation, and clearly cares about the well-being of others. In the Sunday comics series through the following year, the Woggle-Bug is depicted as leading his companions out of trouble, displaying his wisdom, and also doing random acts of kindness for the poor citizens of America. The Woggle-Bug, like many of Baum's characters, contains many contradictions. He is polite, kind, and courtly while also at times being conceited and uncaring. When he next appears in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz as the prosecutor in Ozma's court, Baum seemingly decided to portray him as more pompous and arrogant, and decidedly unlikeable. Baum was using him as a mocking of arrogance found in scholars (and also lawyers). The Emerald City of Oz features Dorothy, Aunt Em and Uncle Henry paying a visit to the Woggle-Bug at his academy. In the continuing Oz series, the Professor goes on no more adventures until the last of Baum's books, Glinda of Oz, in which he is given a very harsh description as being so conceited no one cares to associate with him. He is no one's favorite in spite of his famous college of athletics. When Ruth Plumly Thompson took over the series after Baum's death, she portrayed him exactly like this. When he sets into motion the plot of The Royal Book of Oz, he accuses the Scarecrow of lacking any ancestry for him to list in the Royal Genealogy. Authors have portrayed him in varying ways ever since, sometimes lovable as he was originally, and sometimes extremely arrogant, and sometimes as just well-meaningly lofty. The Professor has a significant role in John R. Neill's The Runaway in Oz. In other media 1905 advertisement in the Chicago Record Herald * To promote his new book The Marvelous Land of Oz, Baum wrote a series of short stories called Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz, with comics illustrations by Walt McDougall. These stories were syndicated to newspapers across the country, and appeared in the children's page of the Sunday comics. The stories ran from 28 August 1904 through 26 February 1905. The first seventeen of them ended with a bit of missing information and the question, \\"What did the Woggle-bug say?\\" One of the characters would ask the Woggle-Bug a question, and readers were invited to guess the answer for a prize. The correct answer was given the following Sunday. Much publicity surrounded the contest including sheet music, pin-back buttons, postcards, games, and more. * Following the success of The Marvelous Land of Oz, Baum wrote a stage musical loosely based on the story; he hoped to recreate the smash hit of the 1902 musical stage adaption of The Wizard of Oz. The new musical was called The Woggle-Bug and featured 26-year-old Fred Mace (who later became of star of Mack Sennett comedies) played the Woggle-bug, singing such songs as \\"Mr. H. M. Woggle-bug, T.E.\\" and \\"There's a Lady Bug Awaiting for me\\", and Sydney Deane, who would become the first Australian to appear in a Hollywood movie.Bonnell, M. (2004) \\"Men of Many Talents\\", The Journal of the Cricket Society, vol. 21, no. 4., The Cricket Society. In the play, the Woggle-Bug initially sides with Mombi and General Jinjur's Army of Revolt, but falls in with the heroes when he flees from the Army's charge and is taken prisoner. The play opened and closed in Chicago. It had many elements of comedy absent from the book; in the play, the Woggle-Bug has a passion for a dress made of a bright Wagnerian plaid and he instantly falls in love with whoever wears it next. It also includes a \\"colored\\" (probably blackface) cook named Dinah and has Professor Knowitt [sic] as the male love interest with Prissy Pring, a lieutenant in General Jinjur's army, as his female counterpart. The show received a few kind reviews but ultimately it \\"ceased to woggle,\\" as one critique put it. It closed in less than a month. * The play was also adapted as a short book, The Woggle-Bug Book. * The \\"wogglebugs\\" (\\"wogs\\") of Philip Jose Farmer's celebrated 1952 novella The Lovers are extraterrestrials that resemble Baum's character. * The Woggle-Bug is a supporting character in Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz, voiced by JP Karliak.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town and locality in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia. Dalby is within and is the administrative centre of the Western Downs Region. At the 2016 census, Dalby had a population of 12,719.  Geography  Dalby is approximately west northwest of the state capital, Brisbane, at the junction of the Warrego, Moonie and Bunya Highways. and the centre of Australia's richest grain and cotton growing area. History Children marching in the main street, ca. 1915 Baranggum (also known as Barrunggam, Barunggam Parrungoom, Murrumgama) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Baranggum people. The Baranggum language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Western Downs Regional Council, particularly Dalby, Tara, Jandowae and west towards Chinchilla. Dalby was founded in the early 1840s at a place known locally as \\"The Crossing\\" on Myall Creek, a tributary of the Condamine River. The first settler was Henry Dennis, who explored the region and chose land for himself and others in the locality.Dalby Town Council:Birth and beginnings Official website. Retrieved 27 October 2006. Today an obelisk in Edward Street denotes the location where Dennis camped. A small settlement was founded to assist travellers heading north to nearby Jimbour Station. The explorer Ludwig Leichhardt visited the area in 1844, on his way to Port Essington.John and Anne Healy of Dalby, Family Record and Story (Feb 2005) In February 1853, the New South Wales government sent the Deputy Surveyor General Captain Samuel Perry to the area to survey a township. In August of the following year, Mr Charles Douglas Eastaughffe arrived with a document under the Seal of the NSW Government officially proclaiming 'Dalby' a township. Mr Eastaughffe was later appointed Chief Constable and remained in Dalby until his retirement. The name of the town is believed to come from the village of Dalby on the Isle of Man and reflects immigration from the Isle of Man in the mid-19th century. The name was apparently chosen by Captain Samuel Perry when he surveyed the settlement in 1853. Myall Creek Post Office also opened in 1854 in Roche's store, with Mr Simpson as the first postmaster. It was renamed Dalby in 1855. In 1859, Dalby became part of the new state of Queensland. Dalby State School opened on 1 June 1861. In 1869 the school split into Dalby Boys State School Dalby Girls State School. In 1885 the girls' school became Dalby Girls & Infants State School. In 1893 the two schools were combined as Dalby State School. In 1914 the school expanded to include a secondary school, which closed in 1954, due to the establishment of a separate secondary school, Dalby State High School. In August 1863 Dalby was officially proclaimed a municipality, the Borough of Dalby, in the Queensland Government Gazette. Dalby Non-Vested School opened as a Roman Catholic girls school in 1864 and in 1866 became a non-vested school (the teachers' salaries were paid by the Queensland Government but the government did not operate the school). Circa 1880, the school either closed or continued without government funding. On Sunday 5 August 1866 Bishop James Quinn dedicated St Joseph's Catholic Church. Dalby was linked by the Western railway line to Ipswich on 16 April 1868. On Sunday 20 June 1869 the first Presbyterian church was opened in Dalby. Reverend George Grimm had conducting regular services since 1865. St Columba's School was a Catholic primary school which was opened in 1877 by the Sisters of Mercy. In 2008, it merged with St Mary's College to create Our Lady of the Southern Cross College. From 1873 to 1949 the electoral district of Dalby was an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. Dalby was believed to have a healthy climate and in 1900 the Queensland Government built the Jubilee Sanitorium for consumptive patients. In 1904 the Dalby Town Council erected therapeutic thermal baths using artesian water from a local bore for those wishing to improve their health by \\"taking the waters\\". In 1938, the council closed the artesian baths as interest in \\"taking the waters\\" was declining. Medical opinion became increasingly doubtful of the benefits of bathing in mineral waters, favouring drugs and physiotherapy as better treatments. The Dalby War Memorial was unveiled by the Queensland Governor, Matthew Nathan, on 26 July 1922. Inside the Paragon Cafe at Dalby, Queensland, ca. 1936 The Paragon Cafe was purchased in 1935 by Milton (Miltiadis) Dimitrios Samios part of the cultural phenomenon of Greek cafes in Queensland. Paragon Cafe employed three men and six women with taking increasing from 90 pounds to 200 pounds within the first year of trading. Dalby State High School opened on 2 February 1954. Bunya Campus was acquired by Dalby State High School at the start of 2011 and has since provided students who live out of the catchment area the opportunity to attend Dalby State High School and participate in all it has to offer as a boarding student. St Mary's College was a Catholic secondary school opened on 21 January 1963 by the Christian Brothers. In 2008, it merged with St Columba's School to create Our Lady of the Southern Cross College. Dalby South State School opened on 29 March 1965. Dalby Christian School was opened on 1 February 1981 by the Dalby Gospel Chapel. The Christian Outreach College opened on 28 January 1984. It closed on 18 September 1991. Dalby Library opened in 2014.  Heritage listings  Dalby War Memorial, 2008 Dalby has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 133 Cunningham Street: former Dalby Town Council Chambers and Offices * 153 Cunningham Street: St John's Anglican Church * 169 Cunningham Street: St Columba's Convent * 21 New Street: Dalby Fire Station * 28B Nicholson Street: Dalby State High School * Patrick Street: Dalby War Memorial and Gates * 58 Patrick Street: Dalby Olympic Swimming Pool Climate Dalby has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K√∂ppen climate classification) and being located just to the west of the Great Dividing Range it is hotter and less humid in summer and colder and drier in winter than nearby locations on the other side of the range. Dalby has had a recording weather station since 1893, but that was replaced in 1992 by another station at the Dalby Airport. The town's highest recorded temperature was 45.6 ¬∞C (114.1 ¬∞F) on 4 December 1913, while the coldest was ‚àí7.2 ¬∞C (19.0 ¬∞F) on 5 July 1895. The annual rainfall is 681.2 mm (26.8 in), the majority of which falls as thunderstorms in the summer months. Dalby experienced its worst floods since 1981 in late December 2010. The town's water purification system was flooded, resulting in water restrictions that have hampered clean-up efforts. 112,500 litres (24,700 imp gal; 29,700 US gal) of water were transported to the town of 14,000 residents. In early March 2013, Dalby received another severe flood, cutting the town in two after 122 mm (4.8 in) of rain was recorded over a few days. Flood waters peaked at 3.21 meters and a number of homes received water damage. Industry Industry in Dalby includes large-scale engineering, coal mining, and fuels (ethanol). Dalby is the centre of a diverse and productive agricultural area with rich black soil allowing the production of crops such as wheat, cotton and sorghum. Livestock raising including pigs, cattle and sheep is also popular. Two cotton gins are situated within of the town. Dalby is to be the site of the first dry mill grain-to-ethanol plant constructed in Australia (the first plant built specifically for the production of ethanol for fuel since the Second World War).Hartland, Susan \\"$54 million ethanol plant for Dalby\\" Toowoomba Chronicle 9 November 2006 Retrieved 27 October 2006 Power The local area is developing an energy-based economy with a large coal-fired power station and a number of coal mines and natural gas bores being established to the west of Dalby. A local company has been awarded a contract to establish wind turbines on adjacent farm land. Approximately west of Dalby is the Kogan Creek Power Station. This A$1.2 billion project is a 750-megawatt coal-fired power station, with adjacent coal mine being developed at the small town of Kogan, which is roughly equidistant between Dalby, Chinchilla, and Tara. Development Aerial view of the town taken in 2008. The opening of a shopping centre at the northern end of Cunningham Street has brought new life to the Dalby CBD. Dalby Shoppingworld includes Woolworths, Big W, Amcal and other specialty shops. Dalby's Water Treatment Plant uses a state-of-the-art reverse osmosis process provided by two plants. The first Reverse Osmosis plant, which opened in 2004, was the first in Queensland. The second and larger plant opened in 2011. Water and sewerage treatment services are provided by Western Downs Regional Council. The town has made a ground- breaking deal with nearby gas companies by taking water from gas fields. It has been noted that the town will have a definite water supply for at least another 30 years, taking into account demographic trends. Dalby's population has been increasing rapidly recently with many new estates created and subdivisions made. Some notable new estates include Sunnyside Estate, Heritage Gardens, Callistemon Park and a new estate on the Warrego Highway side of Sandalwood Avenue.  Population  At the 2016 Census, Dalby had a population of 12,719. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.0% of the population. * 84.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Philippines 1.9%, New Zealand 1.3%, England 1.1% and South Africa 0.8%. * 88.7% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Tagalog at 1.0%. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 26.3%, Anglican 19.6% and No Religion 16.9%.

Wilkinson in 1963 to illustrate a difficulty when finding the root of a polynomial: the location of the roots can be very sensitive to perturbations in the coefficients of the polynomial. The polynomial is : w(x) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{20} (x - i) = (x-1)(x-2) \\\\cdots (x-20). Sometimes, the term Wilkinson's polynomial is also used to refer to some other polynomials appearing in Wilkinson's discussion. Background Wilkinson's polynomial arose in the study of algorithms for finding the roots of a polynomial : p(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n c_i x^i. It is a natural question in numerical analysis to ask whether the problem of finding the roots of p from the coefficients ci is well-conditioned. That is, we hope that a small change in the coefficients will lead to a small change in the roots. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. The problem is ill-conditioned when the polynomial has a multiple root. For instance, the polynomial x2 has a double root at x = 0\\\\. However, the polynomial x2 ‚àí Œµ (a perturbation of size Œµ) has roots at ¬±‚àöŒµ, which is much bigger than Œµ when Œµ is small. It is therefore natural to expect that ill- conditioning also occurs when the polynomial has zeros which are very close. However, the problem may also be extremely ill-conditioned for polynomials with well-separated zeros. Wilkinson used the polynomial w(x) to illustrate this point (Wilkinson 1963). In 1984, he described the personal impact of this discovery: :Speaking for myself I regard it as the most traumatic experience in my career as a numerical analyst. Wilkinson's polynomial is often used to illustrate the undesirability of naively computing eigenvalues of a matrix by first calculating the coefficients of the matrix's characteristic polynomial and then finding its roots, since using the coefficients as an intermediate step may introduce an extreme ill-conditioning even if the original problem was well conditioned. Conditioning of Wilkinson's polynomial Wilkinson's polynomial : w(x) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{20} (x - i) = (x-1)(x-2) \\\\cdots (x-20) clearly has 20 roots, located at x = 1, 2, ..., 20. These roots are far apart. However, the polynomial is still very ill-conditioned. Expanding the polynomial, one finds : \\\\begin{align} w(x) = {} & x^{20}-210 x^{19}+20615 x^{18}-1256850x^{17}+53327946 x^{16} \\\\ & {}-1672280820x^{15}+40171771630 x^{14}-756111184500x^{13} \\\\ & {}+11310276995381x^{12}-135585182899530x^{11} \\\\ & {}+1307535010540395x^{10}-10142299865511450x^9 \\\\ & {}+63030812099294896x^8-311333643161390640x^7 \\\\ & {}+1206647803780373360x^6-3599979517947607200x^5 \\\\ & {}+8037811822645051776x^4-12870931245150988800x^3 \\\\ & {}+13803759753640704000x^2-8752948036761600000x \\\\ & {}+2432902008176640000. \\\\end{align} If the coefficient of x19 is decreased from ‚àí210 by 2‚àí23 to ‚àí210.0000001192, then the polynomial value w(20) decreases from 0 to ‚àí2‚àí232019 = ‚àí6.25√ó1017, and the root at x = 20 grows to x ‚âà 20.8 . The roots at x = 18 and x = 19 collide into a double root at x ‚âà 18.62 which turns into a pair of complex conjugate roots at x ‚âà 19.5 ¬± 1.9i as the perturbation increases further. The 20 roots become (to 5 decimals) : \\\\begin{array}{rrrrr} 1.00000 & 2.00000 & 3.00000 & 4.00000 & 5.00000 [8pt] 6.00001 & 6.99970 & 8.00727 & 8.91725 & 20.84691 [8pt] 10.09527\\\\pm {} & 11.79363 \\\\pm {} & 13.99236\\\\pm{} & 16.73074\\\\pm{} & 19.50244 \\\\pm {} [-3pt] 0.64350i & 1.65233i & 2.51883i & 2.81262i & 1.94033i \\\\end{array} Some of the roots are greatly displaced, even though the change to the coefficient is tiny and the original roots seem widely spaced. Wilkinson showed by the stability analysis discussed in the next section that this behavior is related to the fact that some roots Œ± (such as Œ± = 15) have many roots Œ≤ that are \\"close\\" in the sense that Œ± ‚àí Œ≤ is smaller than Œ±. Wilkinson chose the perturbation of 2‚àí23 because his Pilot ACE computer had 30-bit floating point significands, so for numbers around 210, 2‚àí23 was an error in the first bit position not represented in the computer. The two real numbers, ‚àí210 and ‚àí210 ‚àí 2‚àí23, are represented by the same floating point number, which means that 2‚àí23 is the unavoidable error in representing a real coefficient close to ‚àí210 by a floating point number on that computer. The perturbation analysis shows that 30-bit coefficient precision is insufficient for separating the roots of Wilkinson's polynomial. Stability analysis Suppose that we perturb a polynomial p(x) = Œ† (x ‚àí Œ±j) with roots Œ±j by adding a small multiple t¬∑c(x) of a polynomial c(x), and ask how this affects the roots Œ±j. To first order, the change in the roots will be controlled by the derivative :{d\\\\alpha_j \\\\over dt} = -{c(\\\\alpha_j)\\\\over p^\\\\prime(\\\\alpha_j)}. When the derivative is large, the roots will be less stable under variations of t, and conversely if this derivative is small the roots will be stable. In particular, if Œ±j is a multiple root, then the denominator vanishes. In this case, Œ±j is usually not differentiable with respect to t (unless c happens to vanish there), and the roots will be extremely unstable. For small values of t the perturbed root is given by the power series expansion in t : \\\\alpha_j + {d\\\\alpha_j \\\\over dt}t +{d^2\\\\alpha_j \\\\over dt^2}{t^2\\\\over 2!} + \\\\cdots and one expects problems when t is larger than the radius of convergence of this power series, which is given by the smallest value of t such that the root Œ±j becomes multiple. A very crude estimate for this radius takes half the distance from Œ±j to the nearest root, and divides by the derivative above. In the example of Wilkinson's polynomial of degree 20, the roots are given by Œ±j = j for j = 1, ..., 20, and c(x) is equal to x19. So the derivative is given by :{d\\\\alpha_j \\\\over dt} = -{\\\\alpha_j^{19}\\\\over \\\\prod_{k e j}(\\\\alpha_j-\\\\alpha_k)} = -\\\\prod_{k e j}{\\\\alpha_j\\\\over \\\\alpha_j-\\\\alpha_k} . \\\\,! This shows that the root Œ±j will be less stable if there are many roots Œ±k close to Œ±j, in the sense that the distance Œ±j ‚àí Œ±k between them is smaller than Œ±j. Example. For the root Œ±1 = 1, the derivative is equal to 1/19! which is very small; this root is stable even for large changes in t. This is because all the other roots Œ≤ are a long way from it, in the sense that Œ±1 ‚àí Œ≤ = 1, 2, 3, ..., 19 is larger than Œ±1 = 1. For example, even if t is as large as ‚Äì10000000000, the root Œ±1 only changes from 1 to about 0.99999991779380 (which is very close to the first order approximation 1 + t/19! ‚âà 0.99999991779365). Similarly, the other small roots of Wilkinson's polynomial are insensitive to changes in t. Example. On the other hand, for the root Œ±20 = 20, the derivative is equal to ‚àí2019/19! which is huge (about 43000000), so this root is very sensitive to small changes in t. The other roots Œ≤ are close to Œ±20, in the sense that Œ≤ ‚àí Œ±20 = 1, 2, 3, ..., 19 is less than Œ±20 = 20. For t = ‚àí2 ‚àí 23 the first-order approximation 20 ‚àí t¬∑2019/19! = 25.137... to the perturbed root 20.84... is terrible; this is even more obvious for the root Œ±19 where the perturbed root has a large imaginary part but the first-order approximation (and for that matter all higher-order approximations) are real. The reason for this discrepancy is that t ‚âà 0.000000119 is greater than the radius of convergence of the power series mentioned above (which is about 0.0000000029, somewhat smaller than the value 0.00000001 given by the crude estimate) so the linearized theory does not apply. For a value such as t = 0.000000001 that is significantly smaller than this radius of convergence, the first-order approximation 19.9569... is reasonably close to the root 19.9509... At first sight the roots Œ±1 = 1 and Œ±20 = 20 of Wilkinson's polynomial appear to be similar, as they are on opposite ends of a symmetric line of roots, and have the same set of distances 1, 2, 3, ..., 19 from other roots. However the analysis above shows that this is grossly misleading: the root Œ±20 = 20 is less stable than Œ±1 = 1 (to small perturbations in the coefficient of x19) by a factor of 2019 = 5242880000000000000000000. Wilkinson's second example The second example considered by Wilkinson is : w_2(x) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{20} (x - 2^{-i}) = (x-2^{-1})(x-2^{-2}) \\\\cdots (x-2^{-20}). The twenty zeros of this polynomial are in a geometric progression with common ratio 2, and hence the quotient : \\\\alpha_j\\\\over \\\\alpha_j-\\\\alpha_k cannot be large. Indeed, the zeros of w2 are quite stable to large relative changes in the coefficients. The effect of the basis The expansion : p(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n c_i x^i expresses the polynomial in a particular basis, namely that of the monomials. If the polynomial is expressed in another basis, then the problem of finding its roots may cease to be ill-conditioned. For example, in a Lagrange form, a small change in one (or several) coefficients need not change the roots too much. Indeed, the basis polynomials for interpolation at the points 0, 1, 2, ..., 20 are : \\\\ell_k(x) = \\\\prod_{i \\\\in {0,\\\\ldots,20} \\\\setminus {k}} \\\\frac{x - i}{k - i}, \\\\qquad\\\\text{for}\\\\quad k=0,\\\\ldots,20. Every polynomial (of degree 20 or less) can be expressed in this basis: : p(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{20} d_i \\\\ell_i(x). For Wilkinson's polynomial, we find : w(x) = (20!) \\\\ell_0(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{20} d_i \\\\ell_i(x) \\\\quad\\\\text{with}\\\\quad d_0=(20!) ,\\\\, d_1=d_2= \\\\cdots =d_{20}=0. Given the definition of the Lagrange basis polynomial ‚Ñì0(x), a change in the coefficient d0 will produce no change in the roots of w. However, a perturbation in the other coefficients (all equal to zero) will slightly change the roots. Therefore, Wilkinson's polynomial is well-conditioned in this basis.

In 2015, the company announced that the harvesting of peat for power generation is to be \\"phased out\\" by 2030, at which point the company would complete its transition to new sustainable businesses located across its bogs and landholding. The new sustainable businesses and activities located across Bord na M√≥na's bogs are said to include; renewable energy development, domestic fuels, biomass development, waste recovery, horticulture, eco- tourism, and community amenities. Although Bord na M√≥na will cease harvesting vast amounts of peat to supply power plants, they will continue to harvest peat for their horticulture and fuels businesses. Despite these changes Bord na M√≥na and the extraction of turf remains controversial in Ireland as it is criticised as being the most environmentally unfriendly form of fuel and having a negative impact on local biodiversity while in receipt of state subsidies.  History  Bord na M√≥na was originally established in 1933 as the Turf Development Board, Limited. The reason for the formation of the Turf Development Board was \\"to develop and improve the Turf Industry...\\" and \\"...to operate and drain bogs...\\". Later, in 1946 the Turf Development Board changed its name to Bord na M√≥na under the Turf Development Act of 1946. This move saw a change in status from that of a limited liability company to a statutory company as well as some significant changes in strategy and operations. World War II had a substantial impact on the development of Ireland's peat industry and the foundation of Bord na M√≥na in 1946. During the war, it was necessary to stockpile peat as a fuel given that coal was in short supply. This was due to a sharp reduction in imports and because the coal being imported was of poor quality. World War II resulted in the implementation of a number of emergency fuel schemes with a particular focus on peat as fuel for the people of Ireland, both inside and outside of traditional turf areas. It is estimated that before the war the annual production of turf per year was three million tons. The war effort added two million tons a year to this. The use of peat as a fuel source during World War II reinforced the government's commitment to develop Ireland's bogs as an indigenous source of energy. After the war, the Irish government had a renewed focus on \\"the production of turf by mechanical processes and its sale at prices that cause it to compete effectively with other fuels\\". The war raised a valid concern around the security of indigenous fuel for Ireland. The resulting solution was a white paper issued by the government setting out what later became known as the First Development Programme. Up to the 1950s, Ireland's bog were harvested for turf, but from the 1950s right through to modern times the bogs were harvested for milled peat. This new method of peat harvesting gave way to harvesting on a scale not yet seen before in Ireland. A number of bogs in the Midlands were the proving ground for this new style of harvesting and are still in production to this day. The primary counties for peat harvesting took place in; Kildare, Offaly, Galway, Longford, Roscommon, and Tipperary. These areas still continue to be the main areas of peat production. In 2020, the Bord na M√≥na announced that it was phasing out peat harvesting in Ireland. No jobs would be lost, and existing peat workers would be reassigned to bog reclamation projects rather than laid off.  Biodiversity  Bord na M√≥na has been responsible for both gains and losses of biodiversity across the bogs under their control. This loss of biodiversity is due to the company's operations which progressively altered the terrain of bogs in their ownership. Bord na M√≥na has made considerable effort to offset the impact of their operations over the years. In the 1970s, a group of Bord na M√≥na employees, led by Tom Barry who was Peatland Environmental Officer at the time, drove an initiative to preserve a number of bogs, including Pollardstown Fen located in County Kildare and Raheenmore Bog in County Offaly. During the 1980s and 1990s, another internal drive saw the conservation of more bogs, including Bellacorick Flush County Mayo, Mongan Bog, Clara Bog, and All Saints Bog in County Offaly. These bogs are now owned and managed by An Taisce, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and other organisations. In 2010, Bord na M√≥na launched its first Biodiversity Action Plan. This plan set out a number of objectives and actions to be carried out over a five-year period 2010 - 2015. It gave an overview of rehabilitation work, natural colonisation projects, and the biodiversity of the company's cutaway bogs. It also highlighted the biodiversity projects in progress and those completed. In 2016, Bord na M√≥na released a second biodiversity action plan. This subsequent plan was developed to build upon the objectives of the first action plan while also looking to the future of Bord na M√≥na's peatlands with regard to Bord na M√≥na's announcement to stop harvesting peat for electricity production by 2030. Speaking about the biodiversity action plans, Bord na M√≥na's Senior Ecologist, Dr. Catherine Farrell said \\"We all need to work together in Bord na M√≥na to ensure the best outcomes for rehabilitation and biodiversity. This will be critical to the delivery of our Biodiversity Action Plans\\".  Harvesting  Bord na M√≥na milled peat harvesting in the Bog of Allen Peat was traditionally manually harvested by operating cutaway bogs. This method (still privately used today) consists of sods being vertically cut from the side face of a peat deposit. Technology was derived to mechanically cut and remove layers of peat from blanket bogs. Today, equipment is used to remove tonnes of peat each day at suitable times of year (rainfall is a significant variable in peat harvesting). Almost all the peat now harvested is milled peat, scraped from the surface of the bog by tractor-towed pin millers. The milled peat is ridged into small piles which are then transferred by harvesters into large piles running parallel along the bog. Railways are laid alongside each pile, the pile loaded into trains and the railway lifted and moved to the next pile. This is the 'Peco' method of working. A few bogs use the 'Haku' method whereby the milled peat is loaded into tractor-towed caterpillar-tracked trailers and deposited in a single heap at the edge of the bog adjacent to a railway line. Each year, the network of drainage ditches is deepened by a few inches before the next harvest. Bord na M√≥na has developed a number of products which were novel developments in their time. Today peat briquettes replace sods of raw peat as a domestic fuel. These briquettes consist of shredded peat, compressed to form a slow-burning, easily stored and transported fuel. The first milled peat plant run by the Bord was financed with a loan of ¬£500,000 from Guinness in 1957.Seanad debates May 1957 Another product developed was peat moss, a combination of peat and soil for use in the garden ‚Äì particularly in pot plants. The company also supplies peat to power stations of the Electricity Supply Board and its own power station Edenderry Power.  Railways  An extensive narrow gauge network is operated by the company in the midlands. Some smaller sections of railway were used in other bog locations, for example in County Donegal until recent years. Bord na M√≥na has an extensive network, which has carried up to 5 million tonnes annually, and is larger than the main network (passenger and freight) operated by Iarnr√≥d √âireann. Bord na M√≥na has one of the largest industrial railways in Europe. Permanent railways run from a hundred peat bogs, each covering hundreds of acres, to power stations, briquette factories, moss peat factories and roadside tipplers. On most of the bogs, temporary tracks are laid along the piles of peat the full length of most bogs. Before a pile has been cleared, another temporary line will have been laid a few hundred feet farther along. More than 200 miles (over 300 km) of temporary track are laid each year and the Bord have specialist track fabrication workshops, tracklaying machines, and a fleet of dedicated locomotives and rolling stock on hand. A few bogs are operated by the Haku process, where the peat is collected in one huge heap at the end or side of a bog, requiring only one railway line to serve it. Clonmacnoise and West Offaly Railway Clonmacnoise and West Offaly Railway: A succession of trains (here three are visible) bring milled peat to the Shannonbridge electricity generating station. Part of the Blackwater bog system was also used for tourist trains - the Clonmacnoise and West Offaly Railway (colloquially the \\"Bog Train\\") for about twelve years. This service ceased permanently on October 2008 as it interfered with the heavy peat traffic heading for West Offaly Power Station. One line of the Blackwater system runs along a section of the former Ballinasloe branch canal. This includes a section where the railway runs through Kylemore Lock. The newest branch of this system runs north from existing bogs at Bloomhill to the new bogs of Kilgarvan and Bunnahinley ‚Äì the latter in the outskirts of Athlone ‚Äì and opened for traffic c. 2011. All three of Bord na M√≥na's old steam locomotives are preserved, one by the Irish Steam Preservation Society at Stradbally, County Laois. Each of the three power stations ‚Äì West Offaly at Shannonbridge, Co Offaly; Edenderry, Co Offaly; Lough Ree, Lanesborough, Co Longford ‚Äì is the hub of an extensive rail network carrying heavy traffic. As an example, twelvetrains or rakes (locomotive and sixteen wagons) were in daily use sixteen hours a day at West Offaly in April 2009. Other, generally older locomotives, handle fuel trains, track trainloads of track, ash trains and permanent way gangs. the Edenderry Power Station is deriving a lot of its fuel from woodchip and types of biomass and the amount of peat arriving by rail is diminishing. The two briquette factories at Derrinlough, Co Offaly and Littleton, Co Tipperary each have rail connections to 6 or 8 working bogs. Between four and six peat trains work on each system, the trains almost always travelling in pairs as they do at the power stations. Bord na M√≥na also operates several smaller bog railways delivering the peat to tipplers for transfer by road to factories and power stations. They can be found at Gilltown, Ummeras, Kilberry, Prosperous and Almhain North - all in Co Kildare, Coolnamona in Co Laois, Derryfadda in Galway, Coolnagun, Ballivor and Kinnegad in Westmeath, Monettia, Bellair and Killaun in Offaly, and Templetuohy on the Tipperary / Kilkenny border. The Coolnamona Works is largely closed but the railway system was upgraded in 2010/11 to serve a new tippler supplying peat by road to Littleton (Lanespark) Briquette Factory. Locomotives and rolling stock, for many years bought in from outside companies, are now designed and built in-house. New locomotives are invariably 0-4-0DH (diesel-hydraulic) or 4wDH (no connecting rods). Most peat wagons are of the bogie type with aluminium bodies to reduce weight, though there were still thirty or so old steel-bodied wagons in use as of 2009. Templetuohy, the Bord's last traditional sod peat operation, uses four- wheeled open-slatted wagons which end tip into waiting lorries.  Land reclamation  Bog land covered with trees for land reclamation The company is responsible, under government action, for reclaiming spent bogland. These areas of land are usually cleared up, with trees or other suitable vegetation being introduced. Reclaimed bogland is then usually used as a wildlife preserve. With much of the bogs of Ireland depleted, peat-fired electricity stations all closed by 2020. Rhode Power Station near Edenderry, County Offaly, had its cooling towers demolished on 16 March 2004 as it was no longer viable, followed by Bellacorick in north County Mayo on 14 October 2007. The West Offaly Power Station in Shannonbridge will be demolished in 2020 or 2021.https://www.offalyindependent.ie/2020/01/24/esb-to-demolish-west-offaly- power-station/  See also  * List of Irish companies * List of narrow gauge railways in Ireland * Bog  References   External links  * Official site - Bord na M√≥na * Kylemore Lock and BNM train * Heartland, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Turf Development Board Category:Energy companies of Ireland Category:Geology of Ireland Category:3 ft gauge railways in Ireland Category:Industrial railways Category:State-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland Category:Bogs of the Republic of Ireland Category:Peat mining Category:Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications ","title":"Bord na M√≥na"},{"id":"646984","text":"Maurice Bedel in 1927 Maurice Bedel (Paris, December 30, 1883 ‚Äì Thur√© (Vienne), October 15, 1954) was a French novelist and essayist.

When playing cards arrived in Iran, the Persians created the first face cards.The best preserved deck is located in the Topkapƒ± Palace. To avoid idolatry,Origin of playing cards by Copag.

There are fragments of what may be Mamluk court cards from cheaper decks showing human figures which may explain why seated kings and mounted men appear in both Indo-Persian and European cards. Both Mamluk and modern European decks include three face cards per suit, or twelve face cards in a deck of four suits.Gjerde, Tor. Mamluk cards at old.no. Retrieved 18 February 2017. King, Ober, and Under of Acorns from a Swiss deck (1880) The third court card may have had a special role to play since the Spanish, French, and Italians called the newly introduced cards naipe, nahipi, and naibi respectively as opposed to their Arabic name of Kanjifah. In a 1377 description of cards by John of Rheinfelden, the most common decks were structurally the same as the modern 52-card deck.Johannes of Rheinfelden, 1377 at trionfi.com. Retrieved 18 February 2017. Each suit contained a seated king and two marshals, one holding the suit symbol upwards while the other downwards. The marshals correspond to the Ober and Unter ranks in modern-day German and Swiss playing cards. As marshals were cavalry commanders, both ranks may have been mounted unlike their modern counterparts. Less popular decks included ones in which two kings were replaced with queens, all the kings replaced by queens, queens and maids added so as to make 15 cards per suit, and 5 or 6 suited decks with only the kings and two marshal ranks. In Italy and Spain, the Unter and Ober were replaced by the standing Knave and the mounted Knight before 1390, perhaps to make them more visually distinguishable. The Spanish rank of Sota means \\"under\\". In 15th-century France, the knight was dropped in favour of the queen. The 15th-century Italian game of trionfi, which later became known as tarot, also added queens. The Cary-Yale deck had the most with six ranks: king, queen, knight, mounted lady, knave, and damsel or maid for a total of 24. It is unlikely that the Cary-Yale deck was designed for a game in mind as it was an expensive wedding gift and was probably never played. Standing kings are a Spanish innovation which was copied by the French. Throughout most of their history, face cards were not reversible. Players may accidentally reveal that they hold a face card if they flip them right-side up. During the 18th century, Trappola and Tarocco Bolognese decks became the first to be reversible. The trend towards double-headed cards continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Some patterns resisted the innovation, most notably Spanish-suited decks where full figured courts remain dominant. Cards Face cards from the Tarot Nouveau Current playing cards are structured as follows: *German and Swiss playing cards have three male face cards per suit, Unter/Under (a lower-class man or soldier), Ober (a higher ranking man), and K√∂nig (a seated King). *Italian and Spanish playing cards have the Fante or Sota (Knave, a younger man standing), Cavallo or Caballo (Knight or Cavalier, a man sitting on a horse) and Re or Rey (King, wearing a crown). Italian suited kings are seated while Spanish suited kings stand. A few Spanish suited patterns replace male knaves with female counterparts. *French playing cards replaced the middle male with the Queen so it became Knave or \\"Jack\\", Queen, and King. French suited Kings stand. *French and Latin tarot decks have four face cards per suit. Their order is Knave, Knight, Queen, and King for a total of 16 face cards. Figures appearing on tarot trumps are not considered to be face cards. While modern decks of playing cards may contain one or more Jokers depicting a person (such as a jester or clown), Jokers are not normally considered to be face cards. The earliest Jokers, known as Best Bowers, did not depict people until the late 1860s.

It lies at the edge of the Spring Mountains and Red Rock Canyon to the west; it is partly within the official city limits of Las Vegas and partly within unincorporated Clark County. This rapidly growing community occupies over 22,500 acres and according to its developers, \\"has grown to encompass more than 230 parks, more than two dozen public and private schools, 14 houses of worship, nine golf courses, three resort hotels, recreational facilities, retail and entertainment centers, well-established office parks, a medical center, and more.\\" The community is divided into three associations (North, South, and West), which oversee two dozen commercial and residential villages. At the time of the 2010 census, Summerlin's population was nearly 100,000, having risen from 59,000 residents in the year 2000.Summerlin Economy Continues to Grow The community has received national acclaim for its amenities. Notably, it was named the \\"#1 best place to live and play\\" by National Geographic Adventure in 2007 and one of the \\"Best Places to Live in America\\" by Money magazine in 2014.\\"Summerlin Ranked As One of the Best Places to Live in America\\" Summerlin was named after Jean Amelia Summerlin, the grandmother of billionaire land-developer Howard Hughes. The Howard Hughes Corporation maintains ownership of the master-planned community, along with Downtown Summerlin (the community's premier shopping, dining, and entertainment district) and the Las Vegas Ballpark (home of the Las Vegas Aviators minor league baseball team). History In 1952, the famous film director, aviator, and casino mogul Howard Hughes purchased of land in Southern Nevada, making him the Las Vegas Valley's largest landowner. Despite his initial intentions, he ultimately chose not to relocate his company to Nevada, so the purchased land remained undeveloped and empty for decades. After Hughes died of kidney failure in 1976, the Summa Corporation was organized by his heirs to oversee his vast business empire and land holdings. In 1988, the corporation announced that they would be developing the empty acres of land into a master-planned commercial and residential community. They named the project \\"Summerlin\\", after Hughes' paternal grandmother, Jean Amelia Summerlin. In preparation for this large-scale development, Summa Corporation made a deal with the Bureau of Land Management, in which they traded 5000 acres of environmentally sensitive land for 3000 acres of land better suited for development. After this environmental concern was addressed, development began. By the end of 1990, the construction of Summerlin's first residential village, park, and school had been completed. In 1994, Summa Corporation rebranded itself as the Howard Hughes Corporation and continued to develop new Summerlin villages. New home construction continued to boom through the turn of the century. From 1997 to 2007, Summerlin was consistently ranked as the #1 community in the nation for new home sales. The Great Recession caused a temporary slow-down in construction, but signs of revival became especially apparent in 2014, when Downtown Summerlin opened, bringing 106 acres of shopping, dining, and entertainment to Summerlin residents. Residential development also saw a great revival following the recession, and by 2016, Summerlin was once again one of the top communities in America for new home sales. Summerlin is still a growing community. As of 2018, over two dozen commercial and residential villages have been constructed, with over 6,000 acres still available for future development.

Tartan Day is a North American celebration of Scottish heritage on April 6, the date on which the Declaration of Arbroath was signed in 1320. It originated in Canada in the mid-1980s. It spread to other communities of the Scottish diaspora in the 1990s. In Australia the similar International Tartan Day is held on July 1, the anniversary of the repeal of the 1747 Act of Proscription that banned the wearing of tartan. Tartan Days typically have parades of pipe bands, Highland dancing and other Scottish-themed events. Origins On March 9, 1986, a 'Tartan Day' to promote Scottish heritage in Canada was proposed at a meeting of the Federation of Scottish Clans in Nova Scotia. Jean Watson, President of Clan Lamont, petitioned provincial legislatures to recognize April 6 as Tartan Day. The first such proclamation was by Nova Scotia in April 1987. On December 19, 1991, in response to action initiated by the Clans & Scottish Societies of Canada, the Ontario Legislature passed a resolution proclaiming April 6 as Tartan Day, following the example of other Canadian provinces. Meeting in 1997 in Sarasota, Florida, the Scottish Coalition USA looked to see Tartan Day recognized in the US as it was being observed in Canada. In 1998, the efforts of the Scottish Coalition with the leading help of Trent Lott saw the United States Senate Resolution adopt April 6 as National Tartan Day. This led in turn to the Congressional and then Presidential passing of the recognition of Tartan Day Observance on April 6 each year. In Australia, wearing tartan on July 1 has been encouraged since 1989. The day has been promoted as International Tartan Day in Australia since 1996Suzanna Clarke, 'The Pipes Are Calling', The Courier-Mail (July 2, 2005), p. 60. and has been formally recognised by many states, but not at national level. Canada About 15.1% or 4.7 million Canadians claim Scottish descent. As stated above, Tartan Day () in Canada originated with a proposal from the Federation of Scottish Clans in Nova Scotia and has since been proclaimed by all the provincial legislatures. In 2007 Peter Stoffer introduced a private member's bill for 'An Act respecting a Tartan Day'. Progress of the bill was interrupted by the 2008 election, but it has been resubmitted. The Canadian bill got its first reading as C-402 of the 39th Parliament on October 16, 2007, and was reintroduced as C-218 of the 40th Parliament on November 21, 2008. An annual \\"Gathering of the Clans\\" will take place each April 6 or on the Sunday nearest to it on Parliament Hill in Ottawa at noon with pipes, drums and dancing hosted by the Sons of Scotland Pipe Band, Canada's oldest civilian pipe band. The 2011 celebrations marked the first time that Tartan Day has been celebrated with Canada's official tartan having been named: the Maple Leaf. Scotland Angus Council, whose region includes Arbroath, established the first Tartan Day festival in Scotland on April 6, 2004, and has since joined other regional councils in attempting to develop its potential as a global celebration.Frank Urquhart, 'Arbroath declares itself the centre of Scots Tartan Day', The Scotsman (January 18, 2006), p. 23. Argentina Argentina has around 100,000 people of Scottish descent, the largest such community outside the English- speaking world.

Australia Three million Australians are either Scottish or of Scottish descent. International Tartan Day in Australia is celebrated on a local basis in most states on July 1 (or by some community organisations on the nearest Sunday), the anniversary of the Repeal Proclamation of 1782 annulling the Act of Proscription of 1747, which had made wearing tartan an offence punishable with up to seven years' transportation.Celeste Ray (ed.), Transatlantic Scots (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2005), p. 17, n. 19.Jodie Munro O'Brien, 'Tastes of tartan on the Coast', Gold Coast Sun ( June 28, 2006), p. 1. According to Scottish House secretary Moyna Scotland, the tendency to disguise Scottish associations was mirrored in Australia: 'Scots did what they were told to do when they came to Australia, assimilate and integrate, and they almost disappeared', and consequently one aim of Tartan Day is to help Australians reconnect with their Scottish ancestry.'Scottish pride is in for a bonny time', Hornsby and Upper North Shore Advocate, p. 1.

United States There are an estimated 6 million people in the US who claim Scottish descent. Little was done to follow up the New York event in 1982. In 1998, a Coalition of Scottish Americans with the support of Senator Trent Lott successfully lobbied the Senate for the designation of April 6 as National Tartan Day \\"to recognize the outstanding achievements and contributions made by Scottish Americans to the United States\\". Senate Resolution 155, passed on March 20, 1998, referred to the predominance of Scots among the Founding Fathers and claimed that the American Declaration of Independence was \\"modelled on\\" the Declaration of Arbroath. On March 9, 2005, the United States House of Representatives unanimously adopted House Resolution 41, which designates April 6 of each year as \\"National Tartan Day\\". H.Res.41 Chief Sponsors were Congressmen Mike McIntyre from North Carolina and John Duncan from Tennessee, who are the founding co-chairs of the Friends of Scotland Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition to the two chief sponsors, H.Res.41 had 54 co-sponsors, including Congresswoman Candice Miller of Michigan, Congressman Danny K. Davis of Illinois and Congressman Alcee Hastings of Florida, who all addressed the House of Representatives in favor of the resolution. The Tunes of Glory Parade organised by Magnus Orr and Thomas Grotrian in 2002 included 8,250 pipers and drummers marching through the streets of New York, led by Sir Sean Connery and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

By country The medieval practice of appointing heralds or pursuivants to the establishment of a noble household is still common in European countries, particularly those in which there is no official heraldic control or authority. Such appointments are also still made in Scotland, where four private officers of arms exist. These appointments are all purely advisory. Great Britain Traditionally in England, the authority of the thirteen officers of arms in ordinary, who form the corporation of the Kings, Heralds, and Pursuivants of Arms, extends throughout the Commonwealth, with the exception of Scotland, Canada and South Africa. Officers of arms are of three ranks: kings of arms, heralds of arms, and pursuivants of arms. Officers of arms whose appointments are of a permanent nature are known as officers of arms in ordinary; those whose appointments are of a temporary or occasional nature are known as officers of arms extraordinary. The officers of arms in ordinary who form the College of Arms are members of the royal household and receive a nominal salary. In Scotland, the Lord Lyon King of Arms, and the Lyon Clerk and Keeper of the Records control matters armorial within a strict legal framework not enjoyed by their fellow officers of arms in London, and the court which is a part of Scotland's criminal jurisdiction has its own prosecutor, the court's Procurator Fiscal, who is however not an officer of arms. Lord Lyon and the Lyon Clerk are appointed by the crown, and, with the Crown's authority, Lyon appoints the other Scottish officers. The officers of arms in Scotland are also members of the royal household. Republic of Ireland In the Republic of Ireland, matters armorial and genealogical come within the authority of an officer designated the Chief Herald of Ireland. The legal basis for Ireland's heraldic authority, and therefore all grants since 1943, has been questioned by the Attorney General,http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/chiefs/armscrisis.htm therefore, on May 8, 2006 Senator Brendan Ryan introduced the Genealogy & Heraldry Bill, 2006,http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2006/2306/b2306s.pdf in Seanad √âireann (Irish Senate) to remedy this situation and legitimise actions since the transfer of power from the Ulster King of Arms. The Netherlands In the Netherlands, officers of arms do not exist as permanent functions. Private heraldry is not legislated, and state heraldry and the heraldry of the nobility is regulated by the High Council of Nobility. During the royal inauguration ceremony however, two Kings of Arms and two or four Heralds of Arms have figured. These were usually members of the High Council of Nobility. During the inaugurations of Wilhelmina and Juliana, the Kings of Arms wore nineteenth-century style court dress, whereas the Heralds wore tabards. All officers carried rods and wore chains of office.http://www.ambtskostuums.nl/ambtskostuums/adel/wapenen.htm In the inauguration of Queen Beatrix in 1980, the ceremonial office was held by members of the resistance, Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema being the elder King of Arms.A.J.P.H. van Cruyningen, De inhuldiging van de Nederlandse vorst. Van Willem Frederik tot Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard (unpublished thesis, Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen, 1989) 92. Like most other participants in the pageant the officers of arms were no longer wearing ceremonial dress, but white tie instead. The senior King of Arms proclaims the King to be inaugurated after he or she has sworn allegiance to the constitution. The Heralds step outside the New Church in Amsterdam, where the inauguration ceremony is held, to announce this fact to the people gathered outside the church.Van Cruyningen, passim.

In the mediaeval era, many great nobles employed their own officers of arms. Today, there still exist some private pursuivants that are not employed by a government authority. In Scotland, for example, several pursuivants of arms have been appointed by Clan Chiefs. These pursuivants of arms look after matters of heraldic and genealogical importance for clan members.

As Ensoniq's first product, it became a best-seller. It was priced below with features previously only found on more expensive samplers like the Fairlight CMI. History The Mirage is the brainchild of Robert Yannes, the man responsible for the MOS Technology SID (Sound Interface Device) chip in the Commodore 64. The Ensoniq Digital Oscillator Chip (Ensoniq ES5503 DOC) that he designed was used in the Mirage, ESQ-1, and SQ-80 and the Apple IIGS personal computer. In 1988, Ensoniq replaced the Mirage with the more advanced EPS (Ensoniq Performance Sampler), and later the EPS-16+ and finally, the ASR-10. Overview There are three versions of the Mirage. The first has a spongy-feeling keyboard and large square black buttons. The second has a better-weighted feel keyboard and small calculator-like buttons. The third is shorter and uses the same plastic case as the SQ-80 and the EPS, has a non-weighted keyboard and sold for about $1300 USD. A 2U rack-mounted version was also produced. After the launch of the EPS in 1988, Ensoniq cut the price of the Mirage to $899, making it by far the cheapest sampler then available. The Mirage is an 8-bit sampler featuring a 61 key velocity- sensitive keyboard, a two-digit LED display, extensive MIDI implementation, analog filters, a 333-event sequencer. It has 128kB of RAM (64kB for each keyboard half) and it is not expandable. Sample rate is variable from 10 kHz to 33 kHz with available sample time ranging from 2 to 6.5 seconds accordingly (for each keyboard half). It includes a built-in 3.5 inch SS/DD floppy disk drive, which is used to boot the operating system as well as to store samples and sequences. Each disk has a copy of the operating system and can be used as a boot disk, obviating the need for a separate boot disk. Each disk stores six samples and up to eight sequences. The keyboard is pre-configured into two halves, each functioning as two independent instruments, though the split point can be moved. This makes it easy to have one sound for the right hand (an upper sound) and another for the left (a lower sound). However, the standard OS can not move samples between keyboard halves. Thus the diskette can save three upper sounds and three lower sounds. Ensoniq later made an alternative OS available called MASOS which trades off performance features for editing features, including the ability to copy an upper sound to a lower sound and vice versa. Using a feature called multi-sampling, the Mirage is also capable of assigning multiple samples to different keys across its keyboard. Using this technique, the Mirage essentially turns into a polyphonic mult-timbral MIDI sound module complete with a velocity-sensitive keyboard that can be used to drive other MIDI sound modules as well its own sound engine. The Mirage sampler has become a minor sought-after item due to the distinctive sound of its low bitrate converters, although not as desirable as similar-sounding samplers such as Akai's MPC60 and S900 due to its complex hexadecimal-based programming. Many industrial producers have championed the Mirage for its abrasive sound qualities.

Website All articles from the print magazine are eventually published online at City Journals website, which also publishes original content (not from the magazine) daily, Mondays through Fridays. The first piece of new content for each week gets posted Sunday afternoon or evening. Original web pieces are generally shorter than the features in the print magazine, being typically about the length of an op-ed. They cover everything from public-policy issues and political developments to economics and popular culture. The website also hosts City Journals weekly podcast, 10 Blocks, which launched in February 2016. 10 Blocks features discussions on urban policy and culture with host Brian C. Anderson and City Journal editors, contributors, and special guests. Episodes cover topics such as: predictive policing; the Bronx renaissance; reform of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; homelessness in Portland, Oregon. History City Journal was founded in 1990 in response to New York City's crisis of governance, especially its high crime, amid broader anxieties about the future of American cities. The New York Post editorial board described it as \\"the magazine that helped save New York City\\". Jay Nordlinger, writing in National Review, called City Journal \\"a beacon of civilization\\". In 2016, City Journal ranked second in The Global Grids \\"Top 20 Urban Planning Websites\\", and again made the list in 2017, ranked fourth. Notable contributors * Brian C.

St. Louis won the pennant and joined the National League the following season. Chicago moved to Pittsburgh in late August, and four teams folded during the season and were replaced. Seven of the twelve teams who were in the league at some point during the season did not play a full schedule. There was also a minor league called the Union Association that operated from 1911 through 1914. History The league was founded in September 1883 by the young St. Louis millionaire Henry Lucas, who was eventually named the league's president, with owner Tom Pratt of the Philadelphia franchise serving as vice-president and Warren W. White of the Washington franchise as secretary. After being appointed president, Lucas bought the best available players for his St. Louis franchise at the expense of the rest of the league, all of this representing an obvious conflict-of- interest situation. Subsequently, the Maroons finished with a record of 94-19 (.832 winning percentage) and won the pennant by 21 games. The league not only suffered from lopsided talent distribution, but also instability (four franchises folded during the season, forcing the league to scramble to replace them with three teams from lower leagues and one new team, while Chicago moved to Pittsburgh mid-season) and a poorly drafted schedule, with the league derisively dubbed \\"The Onion League\\" by its detractors in the two established leagues. The list of franchise movements is as follows: * **April 17** : Season opens with the following franchises: Altoona Mountain Citys, Baltimore Monumentals, Boston Reds, Chicago Browns, Cincinnati Outlaw Reds, Philadelphia Keystones, St. Louis Maroons, and Washington Nationals * **May 31** : Altoona Mountain Citys fold. * **June 7** : Kansas City Cowboys formed to take over Altoona's games starting on this date. * **August 7** : Philadelphia Keystones fold. * **August 18** : Wilmington Quicksteps recruited from Eastern League to take over Philadelphia's games, starting on this date. * **August 21** : Chicago Browns play their last game, with the franchise moving to Pittsburgh. * **September 15** : Wilmington Quicksteps fold, having played their final game on September 12. By this point in the season the St. Louis Maroons have already clinched the pennant, even though there are still five weeks of games left to play. * **September 18** : Pittsburgh Stogies (formerly the Chicago Browns) fold. * **September 27** : St. Paul Saints and Milwaukee Brewers recruited from the Northwest League to finish the Chicago/Pittsburgh schedule, and the Philadelphia/Wilmington schedule, respectively. * **October 19** : Season concludes. On January 15, 1885, at a scheduled UA meeting in Milwaukee, only the Milwaukee and Kansas City franchises showed up, and the league was promptly disbanded. The St. Louis franchise itself was deemed to be strong enough to enter the National League in 1885, but it faced heavy competition within the city, as the St. Louis Browns were a power in the American Association. The lone survivor of the Union moved to Indianapolis and became the Hoosiers after 1886, having compiled records of 36-72 and 43-79, and played three seasons before folding, with records of 37-89, 50-85 and 59-75 for a .360 win percentage in the NL, and an all-time winning percentage of .432. These figures perhaps reveal the gulf in class between the UA and the established major leagues. Perhaps the most obvious impact of the short-lived league was on the career of a player who did not jump to the new league: Charles Radbourn. With a schedule of a little over 100 games, most teams employed two regular pitchers, and the Providence Grays in the National League featured Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney. According to the 1991 book Glory Fades Away by Jerry Lansche, Sweeney fell out of grace with the Providence team in late July after he refused to be replaced in a game while drunk, and was expelled. Rather than come crawling back, Sweeney signed with Lucas' team, leaving Radbourn by himself. Leveraging his situation, Radbourn pledged to stay with the club and be the sole primary pitcher if he would be given a raise and granted free agency at season's end. Radbourn, who already had 24 wins at that point to Sweeney's 17, pitched nearly every game after that, and went on to win an astounding 59 games (a record) during the regular season. For an encore, he won all three games of 1884's version of the World Series, pitching every inning of a sweep of the New York Metropolitans of the American Association. His performance in 1884, along with a generally strong career and an overall record of 309-194 (.614) assured Radbourn his place in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Notable players The best hitter of the 1884 Union Association was Fred Dunlap of the Maroons. Star pitchers for the UA included Jim McCormick, Charlie Sweeney, Dupee Shaw and Hugh Daily. Notable players that made their debut in the Union Association included Tommy McCarthy, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1946, and Jack Clements, the only man in baseball history to play a full career as a left-handed catcher.1884 Union Association Baseball Debuts / Rookies by Baseball Almanac Switch-pitcher Tony Mullane attempted to sign with the Maroons, but was threatened with banishment from the NL if he did so (the Browns had a reserve clause on Mullane) and relented. Highlights The Union Association saw two no-hitters in its brief existence: one by Dick Burns of the Outlaw Reds on August 26 and one by Ed Cushman of the Brewers on September 28. On July 7, Hugh Daily struck out 19 Boston Reds in a nine-inning game, an \\"MLB\\" record that would stand for 102 years, until Roger Clemens struck out 20 batters in a game in 1986. Henry Porter and Dupee Shaw got 18-strikeout games. The Chicago Browns executed a triple play on June 19. Standings Status as a major league Although the league is conventionally listed as a major league, this status has been questioned by a number of modern baseball historians, most notably Bill James in The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract. The league had a number of major league players (on the St. Louis franchise, at least), but the league's overall talent and organization was notably inferior to that of the two established major leagues. James found that the contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league: the earliest record he could find of the Union Association as a major league was Ernest Lanigan's The Baseball Cyclopedia, published in 1922. For example, the league's only \\"star\\" player, Fred Dunlap, led the league in batting average with .412 (86 points higher than his second-best season and 120 points higher than his career average), on-base percentage, slugging percentage, runs scored, hits, total bases, and home runs (with 13, typical for the era). After the Association folded, Dunlap never hit more than .274 or more than seven home runs until he retired in 1891, another measure of the inferior quality of the Union Association. In point of fact, if the 1884 season is excluded from his career totals, Dunlap's career batting average was .276 (a drop of sixteen points), and he hit 28 career home runs. Of the 272 players in the Association, 107 (39.34%) never played in another major league, while 72 (26.47%) played very briefly (less than 300 at bats and/or 50 hits) in other major leagues, and 79 (29.04%) had longer careers but little success in other major leagues.

There have been four such arrangements, and one alleged proposal, at the national level. In many local councils in the UK there are similar arrangements, although there are also arrangements where the Lib Dems and Labour oppose each other and instead form a local alliance with another party or with independent councillors. 19th century Before the Labour Party had been formed, various candidates stood for Parliament with backing from the Liberal Party and the Labour Representation League; these included Thomas Burt, Harry Broadhurst and Alexander Macdonald. These MPs were referred to as \\"Lib‚ÄìLab\\", although there was not a formal pact. This agreement eventually fell apart with the formation of the Independent Labour Party and the Labour Representation Committee. 20th century 1903 In 1903, an agreement was made between Herbert Gladstone (then Chief Whip of the Liberal Party) and Ramsay MacDonald (Secretary of the Labour Representation Committee) that, in thirty constituencies, the Labour Party and the Liberal Party would not stand against each other, and thus would avoid the risk of splitting their vote. As a result of this agreement, in contests against the Conservative Party, 29 Labour MPs were returned at the 1906 general election. 1924 At the 1923 general election, both parties campaigned on the issue of free trade. The Conservative Party, which had campaigned to introduce protective tariffs, lost its parliamentary majority but remained the largest party in the House of Commons. The Liberals agreed to enable the formation of the first Labour minority government in 1924, under the leadership of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The minority government lasted eleven months, then Conservative Stanley Baldwin succeeded MacDonald as Prime Minister. 1929 At the 1929 general election, Labour won the greatest number of seats, but did not have a parliamentary majority. The now much-weakened Liberals allowed the formation of the second Labour government by not aligning with the Conservatives to defeat the new government. 1977 In March 1977, the Labour government‚Äî lacking a majority following a by-election defeat; faced a motion of no confidence. To remain in office, Prime Minister James Callaghan approached the Liberal Party, at the time led by David Steel. Former Foreign Secretary Callaghan had been Prime Minister for just one year, having succeeded Harold Wilson who had led Labour to a three-seat majority at the October 1974 general election. An agreement was negotiated, under the terms of which the Labour Party accepted a limited number of Liberal Party policy proposals and in exchange, the Liberal Party agreed to vote with the government in any subsequent motion of no confidence. This \\"pact\\" was the first official bi- party agreement since the Second World War (there would be a Conservative‚ÄìLib Dem coalition following the 2010 general election), it was far short of a coalition. The Lib‚ÄìLab Pact's end was confirmed on 7 September 1978, by which time Callaghan was expected to call a general election, but instead he decided to remain as leader of a minority government. This government fell after a vote of no confidence was passed by one vote in March 1979, whereby Callaghan was forced to hold a general election in May, in which Margaret Thatcher led the Conservatives into power. Proposed coalition of 1997 In the lead-up to the 1997 general election, a coalition government was discussed by Tony Blair and the Lib Dems, according to Paddy Ashdown's The Ashdown Diaries. Ashdown, a strong proponent of a Lib-Lab coalition, said that from Blair's point of view, in order to get the Conservatives out of power and because he wanted to move his party towards the New Labour ideal, a coalition would strengthen his majority in the likely event of a victory. To get the Liberal Democrats into his Cabinet, he allegedly agreed on their terms of electoral reform. Blair was still considering attempting to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats on the day of the general election, until the full scale of his Labour Party's majority became clear at 03:05 on the morning of 2 May 1997; ending eighteen years of Conservative rule. It is alleged that Blair still harboured thoughts of getting the Lib Dems into Cabinet, but that John Prescott's resignation threat stemmed this. 21st century Proposed coalition of 2010 After the hung parliament in 2010, the Liberal Democrats, as they had indicated they would do so prior to the election, first began negotiations with the Conservatives‚Äîthe party that had won the most votes and seats‚Äîabout the possibility of forming a government; but, after talks appeared to have stalled, complementary negotiations were undertaken with Labour. Labour's delegation for negotiations included: Peter Mandelson, Andrew Adonis, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. Press rumours of a possible Lib Dem-Labour deal were publicised, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown alleged to be willing to offer a referendum on the alternative vote system if an arrangement that would keep him in government could be agreed. A Lib-Lab coalition would, however, have been eight seats short of a majority. A coalition of Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SDLP, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and the Green Party‚Äîa \\"rainbow\\" or \\"traffic light\\" coalition‚Äîwould have been needed to give a working majority of one. For this, amongst other reasons, the talks failed. On the collapse of talks with Labour, a deal between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party was reached (subsequently being approved by Liberal Democrats members at a special party conference). There was a significant level of hostility to such a deal within the Labour Party with coalition proposals being opposed by, among others, former Cabinet ministers John Reid and David Blunkett. John Reid said that such a coalition would be \\"bad for the country\\". David Laws, chief negotiator for the Liberal Democrats in coalition negotiations, subsequently commented on Labour's preparation and conduct in negotiations; his main areas of criticism centred on Labour's lack of contrition about their record over the previous thirteen years, inadequate preparation for discussions, their unwillingness to accommodate Liberal Democrat policy proposals in the potential programme for government, and the arrogant and patronising attitude of specific key Labour figures. He said that whilst he felt Gordon Brown was quite serious about pursuing talks, he believed former minister Ed Balls was deliberately \\"sabotaging\\" them. Possible coalition after 2015 general election Nick Clegg stated his opinion prior to the 2010 general election that the party which wins the most seats but fails to get an absolute majority in the house has the right to attempt to form a government first, either on their own or in a coalition. He stated his willingness to work with the Labour Party if they won a plurality of the votes in 2015. However, some reports said it was unlikely that this would happen under the leadership of Nick Clegg, as both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls voiced discontent with Nick Clegg over his partnership with David Cameron. Later reports indicated that Miliband and Balls were more relaxed with the thought of a Lib-Lab government after the 2015 election. According to an article in The Daily Telegraph, a shadow Cabinet minister who was close to Miliband said: \\"Our activists really hate Clegg. But if having him as Deputy Prime Minister was the price of getting Ed into Number 10 then they would have to stick it.\\" For years, Miliband is said to have refused to speak to Clegg, although relations thawed as the 2015 election grew closer. A senior party figure said that \\"The contact is there and the leaders' offices are now in touch.\\" Senior members of Miliband‚Äôs team, including Lord Adonis, the former Cabinet minister, had been urging him privately to prepare for fresh coalition negotiations after the 2015 general election because opinion polls suggested no party would win an outright majority in 2015. However, neither a coalition nor a pact between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party was necessary, following the Conservatives winning a majority at the 2015 general election and the loss of 49 Liberal Democrat seats. The scale of victory was unexpected by all major polls, and this was the first time a Conservative majority government had been formed in 23 years. Possible coalition after 2019 general election Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, hinted at a possible alliance after the 2019 general election in the event that Jeremy Corbyn resigns as Labour leader.https://news.sky.com/story/general-election- jo-swinson-hints-she-would-work-with-labour-if-jeremy-corbyn-quit-11881661 Once again, this was not necessary, because the Conservatives received a majority of seats at the election, meaning that a Lib-Lab pact would be below the majority mark. Welsh Parliament When the first elections to the new Welsh Assembly took place in 1999 no one party had an absolute majority, and initially Labour sought to run a minority administration. Following a series of close votes and much criticism of the weakness of the Assembly administration, Labour and the Liberal Democrats formed a coalition in October 2000 with the two parties sharing power, including ministerial appointments, with Labour the majority party. The agreement ended at the elections of 2003 when Labour won 50% of the seats and decided to form a minority government. On 11 May 2016, following the 2016 election six days earlier, when the governing Labour Party had 29 AMs elected, one fewer than in 2011 and two short of an overall majority, Welsh Assembly members failed to elect a new First Minister on their return to the Senedd, after the roll-call tied the vote at 29-29; Plaid Cymru nominated its leader Leanne Wood, and won the backing of the Conservatives and UKIP, while Labour's incumbent First Minister Carwyn Jones won the support of sole Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams, the only non-Labour member to back Jones in the tied vote for First Minister (and who, up until the day after the election, had been the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats), and his own party. On 19 May 2016, after Jones was reinstalled unopposed as First Minister, following a deal with Plaid Cymru, Williams was named Cabinet Secretary for Education in Jones's new Welsh Government; her appointment as Education Secretary was subject to ratification by Liberal Democrat members at a special conference in Newtown, Powys on 21 May 2016 and was overwhelmingly approved. Scottish Parliament After the first general election to the reconvened Scottish Parliament in 1999, the Scottish Liberal Democrats signed up to what was termed a \\"partnership government\\" with Labour, with both parties providing ministers in a shared government. Although standing on separate manifestos in the succeeding 2003 Scottish Parliament election the joint working continued, with Labour's Jack McConnell serving as First Minister, and the Lib Dems' Jim Wallace serving under him as Deputy First Minister (and Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning) who was then succeeded by Nicol Stephen of the same party as Deputy First Minister. The Scottish Parliament general election of 2007 saw the Scottish National Party (SNP) surpass Labour as the largest party by one seat. The Scottish Liberal Democrats decided against coalition with either the SNP or Labour, and abstained in the vote for First Minister, won by SNP leader Alex Salmond. Gibraltarian Parliament The major UK political parties do not stand candidates for election in the Gibraltar Parliament, but form affiliations with the local Gibraltarian parties, with the Liberal Democrats affiliating with the Liberal Party of Gibraltar (LPG) and Labour affiliating with the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP). The two parties formed the GSLP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance in 2000 and together have been the government in power since 2011. Constitutional committee Whilst not a pact, ahead of the 1997 election Labour Leader Tony Blair and Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown set up the Labour-Liberal Democrat joint committee on constitutional reform to discuss devolution in Wales and Scotland, and led to Prime Minister Tony Blair setting up a joint Lib‚ÄìLab cabinet committee. In part this led to the Scottish and Welsh alliances noted above. The committee was disbanded by Tony Blair and Charles Kennedy in September 2001.

It emerged from the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the sport's first players' union. The Brotherhood included most of the best players of the National League. Brotherhood members, led by John Montgomery Ward, left the National League and formed the Players' League after failing to change the lopsided player-management relationship of the National League. The PL lasted just the one season of 1890, and the Boston franchise won the championship. Although known to historians as the Players' League, newspapers often reported the standings with the shorthand titles of \\"League\\", \\"Association\\" and \\"Brotherhood\\". The PL was well-attended, at least in some cities, but was underfunded, and its owners lacked the confidence to continue beyond the one season. In 1968, a committee appointed by Major League Baseball Commissioner William Eckert ruled that the Players' League was a major league. Franchises and final standings Highlights The Players League Triple Crown leaders were Hall-of-Famer Roger Connor with 14 home runs, Pete Browning with a .373 batting average, and Hardy Richardson with 146 RBI. For pitchers, Mark Baldwin had 34 wins, Silver King had a 2.69 ERA, and Mark Baldwin struck out 211 batters. On June 21, King threw an unofficial eight-inning no-hitter. Oddly, in its one season of operation, the Players League saw seven triple plays: the Giants on June 14, the Red Stockings on June 30, the Pirates on July 15, the Pirates again on July 30, the Burghers on August 15, Ward's Wonders on September 6, and the Bisons on September 29. Legacy The Boston and Philadelphia franchises joined the American Association after the Players' League folded, and both folded together with the AA after the 1891 season. The PL franchises in Brooklyn, New York, Chicago and Pittsburgh each merged with their National League counterparts after the 1890 season. Although the league was started by the players themselves, essentially as an elaborate job-action to improve their lot, the venture proved to be a setback for them in the longer term. The infamous reserve clause remained intact, and would remain thus for the next 85 years or so. The already-shaky AA had been further weakened by the presence of the PL. The Lou Bierbauer incident, in which the Pittsburgh Alleghenys signed Bierbauer over the objections of the AA's Philadelphia Athletics, the team he had played with before joining the Players' League, caused a schism between the NL and the AA, and the AA failed a year later, reducing the total number of major league teams (and players), giving the remaining owners much greater leverage against the players. One benefit of the league, from the management standpoint, was the construction of new facilities, several of which were used for a while by the established major league clubs. The most prominent of these was a new Polo Grounds, originally constructed as Brotherhood Park for the New York Giants of the Players League. Afterwards it became the home of the National League's New York Giants from 1891 to 1957 (it was rebuilt in steel and concrete in 1911) and of the New York Mets in their first two seasons. It was also the site of many other famous sporting events through its 75 years of existence.  References   Notes   Sources consulted  *David Pietrusza.
