Anti-American sentiments are perceived to be deeply entrenched within elements of Spanish society with several surveys conducted concerning the topic tending to back up assertion, with Spain ranking among the highest countries in terms of levels of anti-Americanism in Europe. According to a German Marshall Fund study, feelings towards the United States in Spain were among the least favorable in Europe, second only to Turkey. The sentiment has been historically far from exclusively being of a left-leaning nature, as until recently the United States have been seen under a very negative light by Conservative factions in Spain. The consideration of the Spanish-American War in 1898 as point of origin of anti-Americanism in Spain has been a common place in historiography, yet that extent has been recently disputed, as negative stereotypes about the United States and Americans began to be forged already since the American declaration of independence in 1776. The spread of prejudices and cliches against the United States, common in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, found a fertile ground in Spain. 19th century Spanish anti- Americanism‚Äîstaunchly conservative‚Äîdeveloped via a pan-hispanist discourse that framed the US as an enemy to Spanish interests and the Catholic faith. The 1898 war, perceived in the US as a \\"splendid little war\\", meant a national disaster to many in Spain, although, despite the attempts from the most obstinate right-wing sectors that continued engaging into feeding anti- American sentiment, the immediate aftermath left a focus on self-criticism and a grave crisis in the \\"national psyche\\" rather than a prevalence of revanchist stances within the public opinion. According to Alessandro Seregni, the 20th century Spanish anti-american sentiment was built upon two different political cultures (\\"groups\\" or \\"families\\"), a right-wing one and a left wing one. During World War II right-wing anti-americanism, led by the Church, the Armed Forces and the Falange, was unabashed, with the latter's members becoming sponsors of the worldview underpinned by the \\"Hispanidad\\" in clash with the Monroe Doctrine. Following the end of WWII right-wing antiamericanism became more defensive. Criticism and condemnation of American imperialism was widespread in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s. The US involvement in foreign nations in the 1970s (often endorsing anti-democratic regimes) further tarnished the US' reputation among left-wing sensibilities. For many authors the higher prevalence of anti-americanism in Spain over that of nearby nations has been due to the remembrance of 1898 and to the left-wing resentment of the American partnership with Franco. Besides the former events, the 1953 Pact of Madrid (leading to the installment of US military bases in Spain), the US lack or enthusiasm for a democratic transition in the 1970s in Spain, the US endorsement of far-right dictatorships in Latin America during the Reagan administration, and the invasion of Iraq (including the killing of Jos√© Couso) have been also cited as events fueling anti-americanism. Spain was in fact the European country with the highest levels of opposition to the Iraq war among the public opinion.

Shortly after the hormone calcitonin had been described by Harold Copp, Macintyre's team was the first to isolate and sequence the hormone and to demonstrate its origin in the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. He subsequently analysed its physiological actions. Along with H. R. Morris he isolated and sequenced calcitonin gene- related peptide. Later research centred on the role played by nitric oxide on bone metabolism.  Early life and education  Macintyre was born in Glasgow in 1924, the eldest son of John Macintyre and Margaret (n√©e Shaw). He went to school at Jordanhill College School (subsequently Jordanhill School), Glasgow, passing out as joint dux. He entered the University of Glasgow to study medicine and graduated MBChB in 1947.  Career  After house posts in Glasgow he began as a trainee pathologist in Sheffield, which involved working as a demonstrator in the laboratory of Dr (later Sir) Hans Krebs, the future Nobel laureate. His contact with Krebs would influence his career choice in chemical pathology. He joined the chemical pathology department at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, at the Hammersmith Hospital in London as a registrar. In 1954 he became the Sir Jack Drummond Memorial Fellow, which enabled him to embark on a career of research in biochemistry, initially under the mentorship of Professor Earl King. He designed and constructed a flame photometer that enabled very accurate measurements of blood calcium and magnesium levels. This led to studies of magnesium deficiency. Shortly after Douglas Harold Copp's discovery of the hormone calcitonin, Macintyre's group demonstrated that the hormone was produced in the parafollicular cells of the thyroid rather than the parathyroid gland as suggested by Copp. In 1967 the Gardner International Award was made jointly to Copp and Macintyre for their work on the origin and existence of calcitonin. Macintyre's laboratory also purified and then sequenced both porcine calcitonin and human calcitonin. His team also demonstrated calcitonin gene-related peptide, which they went on to sequence and then characterise. A major contribution to education during his time at the Hammersmith Hospital was the organisation of international endocrinology conferences held every two years between 1967 and 1981. These were attended by leading workers in the field of endocrinology from around the world. He was promoted to the chair of Endocrine Chemistry and Chemical Pathology in 1967 and in 1982 made director of the Wellcome Endocrine Unit based at the Hammersmith Hospital. The research interest expanded into the role of vitamin D in bone metabolism. On retiring from the Hammersmith Hospital he became research director at the William Harvey Research Institute of the University of London. There his research centred on the role of nitric oxide in bone metabolism.  Awards and honours  In 1967 he was awarded (jointly) the Canada Gairdner International Award. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1996. The Royal Society awarded him the Buchanan Medal in 2006.  Family  He married Mabel (Mabs) Wilson Jamieson, on 14 July 1947 in the Chapel of the University of Glasgow. She died in 2003. They had one daughter, Fiona Bell Macintyre. Macintyre died in London in 2008.

The tribe numbers around 20,000 members and are predominately Sunni Muslims. The tribe is transhumant nomadic.  History  The tribe lived around Azerbaijan and Iran before migrating westward after the Mongol invasion and settled around Baskil which during the period of the governance of Aq Qoyunlu, Safavid Iran and the Ottoman Empire went under the name of Hersini. In the 17th century, Hersini was densely populated by Kurdish tribes, including Par√ßikan but also the Zeyve and Herdi tribes. Due to the heavy tax obligations in the Sanjak of Harput, some members of the tribe dispersed to surrounding areas. In addition, some tribe members were forcefully settled in various places in Anatolia. According to tribe leader Dursun Demez, the Ottomans handed over the Sarƒ±√ßi√ßek Plateau in Kemaliye district to his tribe in 1245 by an edict, allowing the tribe to use the land for nomadic pastoralism. In 2019, the tribe pushed for state recognition to make the plateau Par√ßikan land. In 1921, the tribe expressed its support for the Ko√ßgiri rebellion after Nuri Dersimi approached the tribe for support. As the rebellion grew, Par√ßikan Kurds ultimately joined in. Tribal leaders also supported the 2010 Turkish constitutional referendum put forward by AKP.

Virginia voted for the Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent president, James Madison. Madison won Virginia, his home state, by a margin of 46.2%. The race in the state was noteworthy for a dispute within the Federalist Party, who had formed an unofficial pact to support rebel Democratic-Republican candidate DeWitt Clinton nationwide, while putting up Federalist candidate Jared Ingersoll as Clinton's running-mate. The Virginia state Federalist Party rejected this pact, however, and instead nominated Rufus King, the party's vice-presidential candidate in the two previous elections, for president, while nominating William Richardson Davie as King's running-mate. Despite the state's substantial number of presidential electors and the closeness of the race nationally, the dispute did not have a major impact on the election's outcome, as Madison was never considered likely to lose his home state.Bonin, Christopher M.; Virginia in the War of 1812; p152 References Virginia 1812 ","title":"1812 United States presidential election in Virginia"},{"id":"64309646","text":"Rulan Yeh (born 4 September 1984) is an American badminton player who competes in international level events.

History It was built by the Erizzo family in 1480 in the Venetian Gothic style and then passed to the Nani family (later Nani- Mocenigo) in 1537. The Nani family, included in the Serrata del Maggior Consiglio of 1297, moved from Torcello to Venice in the 12th century and subsequently divided into three branches, the main of which died out at the end of the 18th century. Architecture The building has a ground floor with a water portal and two noble floors decorated with quadriforas flanked by pairs of monoforas. The brick facade on the Grand Canal is divided vertically into three sections, each of which has late Gothic decorations: top flowers, trefoil window frames, serrated frames, and Corinthian capitals. The vertical edges of Istrian stone, the string course, and two coats of arms of the Da Lezze family are also present on the facade. The most interesting element of the composition is the quadrifora on the first noble floor, decorated by a projected balcony, columns, elaborate shelves, and zoomorphic figures. The arched water portal is designed in Renaissance forms and disagrees with the overall Gothic ensemble. The facade also offers a large and recent dormer window‚Äîa symptom of a rear extension that added terraces above the roof.

Background S∆°n Tr√† was a fishing village located approximately southeast of Chu Lai Base Area. It had a population of approximately 4,000 people including many resettled refugees. The village was defended by 14 United States Marines of a Combined Action Platoon (CAP) and 30 Popular Force troops and there were also about 35 Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) workers and a small group of People's Self-Defense Forces. The villagers had previously refused to provide aid and recruits to the VC who had threatened to burn the village down. Attack and massacre The attack began at 23:10 on 28 June 1968 with a mortar attack. Many of the civilians took shelter in their defensive bunkers and then between 75 and 300 VC moved through the village throwing satchel charges into bunkers killing their occupants and starting fires. Other villagers fled toward the CAP position, blocking the forces there from engaging the attackers. Soldiers from the 198th Light Infantry Brigade were landed at the CAP position by helicopters approximately 30 minutes after the attack began but they waited until dawn to move into the village.

He won a bronze medal at the 2019 European Games and a gold at the 2018 European Union Championships, both at middleweight. In addition, he competed at two World Championships in 2017 and 2019. Amateur career Csemez started boxing at the age of 12 when a boxing gym, KO Box Club, was opened up in Galanta near his village by legendary boxer and former world lightweight title challenger Tom√°≈° Kov√°cs. Although he had also showed interest in football and judo, he began personally training under Kov√°cs soon thereafter. In 2015, he won a gold medal at the Julius Torma Youth Memorial in Prague, and was presented an award by the Czech Olympic Committee for his performance. The following week he placed first in the welterweight event at the Slovakian National Youth Championships, and was subsequently given the most technical boxer award. At the end of the year Csemez competed at his first European Youth Championships, where he won his first bout before falling to Bibert Tumenov of Russia. The following year he repeated his gold medal- winning performance at the Julius Torma Youth Memorial. At the 2016 European Youth Championships in Russia that summer, he won three matches before losing a decision to Englishman Harris Akbar in the semi-finals, taking home a bronze medal. For this achievement he was officially recognized by the president of the Slovak Boxing Federation Peter Bodoki, along with national teammates Filip Mesz√°ros and D√°vid Mich√°lek. Csemez began his campaign at that year's World Youth Championships, also in Russia, with a controversial decision victory over medal favorite Brett McGinty. He was eliminated by Isami Mesa of Cuba in the next round. He closed out the year by moving up to middleweight and competing at the National Championships, where he won a gold medal in the senior division. He was also named the co-Slovak boxer of the year by the National Sports Center (N≈†C), a recognition he received the following year as well. In 2017, at his new weight class, he boxed at the European U-22 Championships in Romania, but lost his second fight to former European Youth champion Oleksandr Khyzhniak. He decisioned two fighters before losing to two- time Olympian Zolt√°n Harcsa in the quarterfinals of the European Championships in Ukraine. This qualified him for the World Championships in Hamburg at the age of 19; he exited with another second-round loss to Oleksandr Khyzhniak. After winning a tournament in Budapest in October 2017, Csemez was involved in a serious car accident that broke two of his cervical vertebrae and kept him out of the ring for eight months. He was knocked out by Andrej Merzlyakov in the first round of the prestigious Chemistry Cup in Germany in June 2018, then lost by referee stoppage to Nicoleto Grdoviƒç at an international tournament in Slovakia in what was his light heavyweight debut. After this rough return, he then won a gold medal in the middleweight event at the European Union Championships in November, winning all four bouts by unanimous decision. His year ended with his second gold medal at the national championships in December. Csemez was scheduled to compete at the 2019 European U-22 Championships in Russia, but failed a medical exam that kept him out of the ring and awarded his opponent a walkover victory. However a few weeks later he won a gold medal at the second Euro Cup in Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina in his return to light heavyweight, and was given the best boxer award. Back at middleweight, he won a bronze at the 2019 European Games, which doubled as that year's European Championships. He lost his semi-final bout to rival Oleksandr Khyzhniak ‚Äì his third defeat to Khyzhniak in as many match-ups. He then had an early exit at the World Championships, losing in his second fight. In an attempt to qualify for Tokyo 2020 he competed at the 2020 European Olympic Qualification Tournament in London. He defeated Ryszard Lewicki in the opening round and was scheduled to face Miguel Cuadrado of Spain next, but the competition was postponed after three days due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Returning from England he tested positive for the virus, becoming the first Slovak athlete to do so, and had to go into quarantine with the entire Slovak team.

He is also an entrepreneur, a professor emeritus with the University of California, Davis, founder of the R&D; firm Statistical Signal Processing, Inc. (SSPI), and former president, CEO, and chief scientist of this firm for 25 years (1986 to 2011) prior to sale of its IP to Lockheed Martin. Gardner has authored four advanced-level engineering books on statistical signal processing theory including Statistical Spectral Analysis: A Nonprobabilistic Theory, 1987, which remains the most referenced book on the statistical theory of cyclostationarity, with about one thousand citations in peer-reviewed journal articles. Gardner‚Äôs approach in this book is considered to be in keeping with the work of Norbert Wiener in his classic treatise Generalized Harmonic Analysis first published in 1930. In the literature, Gardner is referred to as an influential pioneer of cyclostationarity theory and methodology, on the basis of his being a prolific contributor of seminal advances spanning nearly half a century. Gardner has written more than 100 peer-reviewed original-research articles, a number of which received most-cited-paper and best-research-paper awards. His research papers and books have been cited in over ten thousand peer-reviewed journal articles.  Biography  Gardner married Nancy Susan Lenhart in June 1966 and the following year completed his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology while employed as a member of technical staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories from 1967 to 1969, and completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of Massachusetts under the supervision of Lewis E. Franks in 1972, at which time he joined the University of California, Davis as an Assistant Professor. Gardner performed research and teaching there for nearly 30 years, becoming Professor Emeritus in 2001. In 1982, while at University of California, Gardner founded the R&D; firm Statistical Signal Processing, Inc. (SSPI), an engineering research services company serving primarily the national security sector but also the cellular RF communications industry. He served as the president, CEO, and chief scientist of SSPI for 25 years. He also founded several entrepreneurial ventures during the latter 15 years of that period, including Gardner Technologies in 2001 for which he served as IP inventor and chief technology officer for five years.  Work  After completing his Ph.D. dissertation entitled \\"Representation and Estimation of Cyclostationary Processes,\\" in 1972, Gardner began working on developing a new theory for the class of cyclostationary and polycyclostationary random processes. In 1985, he wrote his first book, Introduction to Random Processes with Applications to Signals and Systems, which focused on the duality between the stochastic theory based on mathematical expectation and the nonstochastic theory based on time averaging, which theory he was developing. Amir Atiya wrote \\"The book is an excellent introduction to the theory of random processes... I recommend everyone working in the areas of signal processing and communications to own a copy.\\" Lawrence Marple wrote \\"The depth of coverage and the ease of readability can be compared to classic texts such as [A Papoulis‚Äôs book which emphasizes theory and J Bendat & A Piersol‚Äôs book which emphasizes estimation in practice]. The two chapters on stochastic calculus and the theory of duality and ergodicity are two of the most accessible and easy to understand presentations of these topics in a textbook... The book covers all key aspects of second order statistics of random processes using many examples and without the theoretical trappings of other introductory texts on this subject. Gardner completed the fundamentals of his nonstochastic theory for stationary processes in 1984 and then reformulated all his research progress to date on cyclostationary stochastic processes within a nonstochastic framework: he developed the novel theory of Fraction-of-Time (FOT) Probability for Poly-Cyclostationary time-series data. Gardner's 1987 book Statistical Spectral Analysis: A Non-probabilistic Theory presented his FOT theory of both stationary and poly-cyclostationary processes and/or time-series in Part I and Part II, respectively. After publication of this book, recognition of his work, together with the cornucopia of practical applications it spawned, initiated a long period of growth of this new field of study, including approximately 50 research grants and contracts awarded to Gardner over the following 30 years, garnering nearly $25M in awards of research and development funding from approximately 25 government agencies and industrial research laboratories. Reviewing the book Statistical Spectral Analysis, Enders A Robinson wrote \\"In this work Professor Gardner has made a significant contribution to statistical spectral analysis, one that would please the early pioneers of spectral theory and especially Norbert Wiener.\\" James Massey wrote \\"I admire the scholarship of this book and its radical departure from the stochastic process bandwagon of the past 40 years.\\" Akiva Yaglom wrote \\"It is important . . . that until Gardner's . . . book was published there was no attempt to present the modern spectral analysis of random processes consistently in language that uses only time-averaging rather than averaging over the statistical ensemble of realizations [of a stochastic process] . . . Professor Gardner's book is a valuable addition to the literature\\". Gardner‚Äôs contributions throughout the literature of the last 50 years are identified by Antonio Napolitano in Cyclostationary Processes and Time Series. In Napolitano‚Äôs book, there are the 720 pages containing citations of about 1400 distinct research publications on cyclostationarity (primarily theory), including 582 citations to publications by Gardner. Gardner provided the original definition and mathematical characterization of almost cyclostationary (ACS) stochastic processes, including poly-CS stochastic processes. He further gave the original definition and mathematical characterization of non-stochastic fraction-of-time (FOT) probabilistic models of CS, ACS, and poly-CS time-series. He also originated the extensions and generalizations of the core theorems and relations comprising the second order and higher-order theories of stationary stochastic processes and stationary non-stochastic time-series to CS, poly-CS, and ACS processes and times-series. In 1987, Professor Gardner was invited by the Editor of IEEE Signal Processing Magazine to write an introduction, for the signal processing community, to the recently discovered 1914 contribution of Albert Einstein to time-series analysis. This introduction reveals the central role played by Professor Gardner's just-published time-average theory in understanding the relationship between Einstein's and Norbert Wiener's (1930) contributions to statistical spectral analysis. Gardner won the international IEEE Stephen O. Rice Prize Paper award in communication theory in 1988 and the International EURASIP Best Paper of the Year Award in 1987; both papers treated his theory of cyclostationarity. Gardner and his students went on to further prove the uses of his theory of cyclostationarity in applications in communications and signals intelligence. Together with his doctoral student Chi Kang Chen, he wrote the book of mathematical problem solving, The Random Processes Tutor: A Comprehensive Solutions Manual for Independent Study in 1989. Gardner, with the assistance of his doctoral student Chad Spooner, also generalized his theory from second-order to higher-order cyclostationarity in the early 1990s, and provided novel insight into the statistical quantity called the cumulant. Later, he worked on cyclostationarity exploitation in the areas of enhanced radio reception for wireless communications and, more extensively, advanced RF signals intelligence. He was the editor and contributing author of the 1994 book, Cyclostationarity in Communications and Signal Processing. Douglas Cochran wrote ‚Äúthis book is a timely contribution that should be a valuable reference for academic and industrial R&D; engineers in signal processing and communication systems.\\" This book was an outgrowth of the first international Workshop on Cyclostationary Signals in 1992, which was funded jointly by the National Science Foundation and the Offices of Research of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force. Gardner served, by invitation of the NSF, as organizer and chair. His 2006 review paper, \\"Cyclostationarity: Half a Century of Research\\" received the Elsevier Most Cited Paper Award for multiple years. Applications of Gardner‚Äôs theory include his discovery and development of the fundamental operational principles of cyclostationarity‚ÄîInsensitivity to Noise and Interference, and Selectivity/Separability of spectral correlation measurements and the signals themselves‚Äîas well as demonstration of applicability to design and analysis of signal processing methods and algorithms for communications, telemetry, and radar systems. This body of work has demonstrated that substantial improvements in system performance can be obtained in various signal processing applications, such as detection, estimation, and classification of signals, by exploiting cyclostationarity‚Äîthat is, by recognizing and modeling the properties CS and ACS instead of using the stationary-process models which were the standard before Gardner. Major applications include cellular telephone, spectrum sensing--for cognitive radio--and signals intelligence for national security.{ Chapters 9 and 10 of the book survey fields of application of the cyclostationarity paradigm and identify on the order of 100 distinct areas of application and cite about 500 published papers addressing these applications. Gardner in 2016 developed the ad hoc concept of time de-warping into the basic theory of converting irregular cyclostationarity into regular cyclostationarity as a means for rendering the extensive and powerful tools of cyclostationary signal processing technology applicable to natural data exhibiting irregular cyclicity, which pervades essentially all fields of science as well as engineering.  Other work  Gardner founded Gardner Technologies, Inc. and served as president and chief technical officer until 2006. Through Gardner Technologies, he ventured into more functional wine- packaging with patented wine bottle openers and closures. Upon terminating his brief cellular-telephone-technology venture with partner Stephen Schell, PureWave Technologies in 2001, he sold the IP to Apple.

Eisenhower in the run-up to the invasion of Normandy in 1944. Addressed to the people of occupied Europe it informed them of the start of the invasion and advised them on the actions Eisenhower wanted them to take. It also addressed the Allies' plans for post-liberation government. Approximately 47 million copies of the speech were printed, in five languages, for distribution to the peoples of Western Europe. A recording for radio broadcast was made on May 28 but, due to one problematic sentence, had to be re-recorded in the following days. One commentator states that Eisenhower's frustration and fatigue is discernible in the recording, when compared to his June 6, 1944, order of the day recorded on May 28. The speech was broadcast over British and American radio on D-Day, June 6. Background  The invasion of Normandy was a significant moment in World War II. A British, American and Canadian Allied Expeditionary Force landed in northern France on June 6, 1944 (D-Day) to begin the liberation of Western Europe from occupation by Nazi Germany. Eisenhower's People of Western Europe speech, named after its opening words, was addressed directly to the people of occupied countries. It informed them of the invasion, the Allied plans for post-liberation government and the actions Eisenhower wanted civilians to take in the meantime. Some 47 million printed copies of the speech were made in five languages for distribution to the occupied peoples of Europe.  Content  William S Paley In the speech Eisenhower asks resistance members to follow the orders of their leaders and for other citizens to avoid wasting their lives in unnecessary acts of resistance without further orders. He notes that the allied forces include Free French troops and, specifically addressing French citizens, reiterates his point that there should not be a \\"premature uprising\\", but there will be a time for armed resistance. Eisenhower promises that those who collaborated with Nazi Germany will be removed from power and states that Frenchmen, selected by the populace, will be placed in charge of the civil government of France after liberation. He also notes that further battles lie ahead and some destruction will be necessary to achieve victory. A version of the speech was recorded on 28 May at the same time as his D-Day order of the day, addressed to members of the invasion force. However, Robert E. Sherwood of the psychological warfare division of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) raised concerns with the wording of one section of the recorded speech. It had originally been phrased that the people of Europe should \\"continue your passive resistance, but do not needlessly endanger your lives before I give you the signal to rise and strike the enemy\\"; Sherwood noted that it could be implied that Eisenhower expected people to \\"needlessly endanger\\" their lives when he gave the order to do so. He proposed that it be reworded to \\"but do not needlessly endanger your lives; wait until I give you the signal to rise and strike the enemy\\". Sherwood's senior, William S. Paley, attempted to alter the recording using a voiceover but could not replicate Eisenhower's voice and tone. The entire speech was therefore re-recorded with portable equipment at Eisenhower's headquarters closer to the time of the invasion. Rives considers that the frustration and fatigue that Eisenhower was experiencing at this time can be discerned in his speech, which is notably different from the upbeat tone of the order of the day recording. Free French leader Charles de Gaulle criticised the speech for failing to mention him or the French Committee of National Liberation, though he was only presented a copy of the finished speech and had no opportunity to suggest amendments at draft stage. Some passages of the speech had been carefully crafted (for example noting only that the \\"initial landing\\" has been made in France) to leave open the possibility that the landings were a feint and that the main invasion was to take place elsewhere, which had been the intention of the wider Operation Bodyguard deception campaign.  D-Day  Omaha beach, 8.30am June 6, 1944 Airborne elements of the Allied Expeditionary Force landed in Normandy from around midnight on 5/6 June. The official notification of the invasion was withheld until the main landings could be confirmed to have commenced. This event began with the American landings at around 6.30am Central European Summer Time (CEST) and was confirmed to SHAEF headquarters by a radioman broadcasting the codeword \\"TOPFLIGHT\\". The British and Canadian landings happened around an hour later. German radio stations in Berlin had been broadcasting the news of the invasion since 6.33 am (12.33 am Eastern War Time in New York) but American media could not confirm this and warned that the messages could be false. In the United Kingdom the first news of the invasion was broadcast at around 9.30 am British Double Summer Time (equivalent to CEST) and Eisenhower's speech and his order of the day, received on disc via military courier, were broadcast soon afterwards. The American broadcast of the speech followed the 3.48 am (Eastern War Time) broadcasts from the leaders of the governments-in-exile of Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands (in their native languages and in English).

Attack and massacre At 02:10 on 29 March, an estimated two battalions of the PAVN 38th Regiment, consisting largely of well-equipped men fresh from North Vietnam, reinforced by two VC sapper battalions, stormed into Duc Duc. Under cover of a mortar and rocket barrage, the PAVN struck directly at the district headquarters compound, while the sappers began systematically destroying the nearby civilian hamlets with satchel charges and by setting fires. Duc Duc's defenders, the 412th Regional Force Company and the 123rd Popular Force Platoon with a handful of United States Army advisors, fell back to the district headquarters compound and made a stand. Soon the PAVN had them completely surrounded and enemy infantry had reached the perimeter defensive wire . The cloud ceiling, down to or , prevented fixed-wing air support from coming to the aid of the defenders. Marine helicopter gunships from HML-167 and HML-367 at Marble Mountain Air Facility were directed to Duc Duc and flying under the clods they found the Duc Duc by the light from the burning villages. As the helicopters approached they contacted the Army advisors by radio who told him that the district compound was in danger of being overrun and gave the Marines clearance to fire at targets anywhere around their perimeter. The Army advisors also stated that they would be unable to direct air strikes from the ground, as enemy fire had forced them under cover. The helicopters engaged the PAVN/VC and were met by heavy automatic weapons fire. The helicopters remained in action for four hours until the PAVN/Vc broke off the attack and fell back northwestward toward the Thu Bon River, where they began wading the river and paddling across in boats. The gunships pursued the PAVN/VC and were credited with four confirmed enemy dead, a probable ten more killed and six boats destroyed. The fighting around Duc Duc continued for the next several days. Units of the ARVN 51st Regiment , sent to reinforce the RF and PF garrison, made repeated contact with the PAVN. Aftermath In the initial attack and the two days of fighting that followed, the PAVN/VC lost at least 59 men killed, and three captured and 22 individual and six crew-served weapons captured while the RF/PF forces who had defended the compound suffered 20 dead and 26 wounded. 103 South Vietnamese civilians had died in the blazing hamlets; 96 more had been injured and 37 kidnapped. At least 1,500 homes had been destroyed. In spite of ARVN counterattacks, the 38th Regiment remained in the Duc Duc area, instead of pulling back into the mountains. On 3 April, the PAVN again attacked the Duc Duc District Headquarters and neighboring hamlets with 100 rounds of mortar fire, numerous RPG rounds, and small arms fire, but did not follow with another ground assault.

It comprises 1,136 lines in octosyllabic couplets, written in Old French. Its author names himself as Pa√Øen de Maisi√®res, but critics disagree as to whether this was his real name or a pseudonym. La Mule is an Arthurian romance relating the adventures, first of Sir Kay, then of Sir Gawain, in attempting to restore to its rightful owner a stolen bridle. It is notable for its early use of the \\"beheading game\\" theme, which later reappeared in the Middle English romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. It is sometimes seen as a skit or burlesque on earlier romances, especially those of Chr√©tien de Troyes, but it has also been suggested that it might have been written by Chr√©tien himself.  Synopsis  A damsel arrives at the court of King Arthur on a mule that has no bridle. This, she says, has been taken from her, and she asks for a knight to retrieve it for her. If any knight succeeds she will be happy again, and will give herself to him. Sir Kay undertakes the quest and is taken by the mule through a forest where he is terrified by lions, tigers and leopards, but they kneel in honour of the mule and let Kay pass. He passes first a foul valley full of serpents, scorpions and fire-breathing beasts, and then a wintry plain. After pausing at a beautiful spring to recover his spirits he reaches a very narrow bridge over a river, but he is too scared to cross this, and so returns shamefaced to Arthur's court. Sir Gawain volunteers to take up the quest, the lady kisses him, and he sets off, encountering the same perils as Kay had done and surmounting them all. He reaches a rapidly revolving castle surrounded by stakes in the ground, on all but one of which is a human head. Gawain urges the mule on and manages to enter the castle with no injury except to the mule's tail, part of which is chopped off. He meets a black and hairy churl, who proposes that Gawain should chop off his head, and that he, the churl, should in turn chop off Gawain's head the next day. Gawain agrees, and beheads the churl. When he presents himself the next day the churl spares him for his sportsmanlike behaviour. He then has to kill two lions, a knight, and two dragons, and is finally received by a lady, the original damsel's sister, who offers him herself and one of her thirty-nine castles. Gawain refuses, instead accepting the purloined bridle. He leaves the castle, encounters local people who rejoice at having been saved by Gawain from the lions, and returns to Arthur's court, where he returns the bridle to its owner.  Manuscript  La Mule sans frein survives in only one manuscript, Bern Burgerbibliothek MS 354, which dates from the third quarter of the 13th century. The manuscript also preserves more than 70 other literary works, including Le Chevalier √† l'√©p√©e, Le Lai du Mantel, Le Folie Tristan de Berne, Le Roman des sept sages de Rome and Chr√©tien de Troyes' Perceval.  Date and authorship  It is generally agreed that La Mule sans frein was written in the late 12th century or the early 13th. The poet wrote in Old French in the Francien dialect native to the √éle-de-France, or perhaps in the very similar Western Champenois dialect. He names himself in the poem itself as Pa√Øen de Maisi√®res, but scholars are divided as to how this name is to be understood, some maintaining that it can be taken at face value while others argue that it is a pseudonym. If fictitious, it may be a play on the name of the 12th-century romancer Chr√©tien de Troyes: Chr√©tien means 'Christian' and Pa√Øen 'pagan', while Troyes and Maisi√®res are both places in southern Champagne; moreover maisi√®res means 'ruins' (such as, perhaps, those of Troy). The literary historian D. D. R. Owen tentatively suggested that the author of both La Mule sans frein and Le Chevalier √† l'√©p√©e might have been Chr√©tien de Troyes himself. Other scholars have tended to be sceptical of this theory, though there is some support for the idea that these two romances are the work of the same man, whatever his name.  Analogues  The early-13th century romance Diu Cr√¥ne by the Austrian poet Heinrich von dem T√ºrlin includes in one of its episodes an independent, and rather fuller, version of the entire story of La Mule sans frain. Extensive borrowings from La Mule have also been traced in Hunbaut and Le Chevalier aux deux √©p√©es, both 13th-century French romances. There are points of similarity with various romances of Chr√©tien de Troyes. His Yvain includes the motif of a horse being cut in half by a falling portcullis, paralleling the mule's tail being cut off in La Mule sans frein, and there are features in common between Yvain, Diu Cr√¥ne, and the passages dealing with the bridle in La Mule that suggest a common source. Sir Kay's failure to achieve his quest has its counterpart in Chr√©tien's Yvain, Lancelot, Erec and Enide and Perceval, and also in the anonymous La Vengeance Raguidel. It was also suggested by D. D. R. Owen and R. C. Johnston, in their edition of La Mule, that La Mule's prologue was modelled on that of Erec and Enide, though Johnston later changed his mind on this. At least two themes in La Mule are of Celtic origin. The revolving fortress can be found in the ancient Irish stories The Voyage of M√°el D√∫in and Bricriu's Feast, and later reappears in various romances of the Holy Grail.. The beheading game, played in La Mule by Gawain and the churl, also appears in Bricriu's Feast, and later in the First Continuation to Chr√©tien's Perceval and in Perlesvaus. Most famously, the beheading game provides the framework for the 14th-century Middle English romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. D. D. R. Owen argued that its author, the Gawain Poet, drew directly and in detail on La Mule and Le Chevalier √† l'√©p√©e for this element of his story, though one scholar has commented on this theory that \\"one piece of rather flimsy evidence is used to support another, with the result that the whole edifice is kept upright by a combination of hope and ingenuity\\".

Description  Female Adults reach 30 to 31 mm, of which 20‚Äì30 mm abdomen, while wingspan is 17‚Äì24 mm. The base coloration is blue with black markings, similar to other coenagrionids. Male can be distinguished by a marking on the top of the second segment of the abdomen (S2) which resembles a stalked wine glass or a trident, but is not always developed. Other segments up to S7 sport pointed markings resembling spears, while the eighth segment is entirely blue with at best two tiny black spots. Females have darker abdomens, but with always some blue on the proximal half of each segment; this characteristic resembles brighter azure damselfly females, which can be distinguished by three forward-pointing black spires (ornate bluet females only have the central one). Males in turn closely resemble the southern damselfly males, from which they can be distinguished by serrated hind edges of eye-sports on the top of the head and details in abdomen markings. The period of activity is short: adults fly in the summer, from May to July or mid-August.  Habitat and distribution  The species breeds in shallow, unshaded, slowly-flowing streams with moderate growth. It is absent from water bodies with densely overgrown banks. Most of the known localities in Europe are along ditches in agricultural areas where people regularly mow the banks and clean the bottoms. The Balkans represent the central area of distribution, with but a few larger isolated populations to the west, specifically in Danube river valley in Bavaria, and in central France. Thus, it is regarded eastern counterpart of the southern damselfly. Ranges of the two species overlap in Central Europe. Ornate bluet is moderately common in the Balkans, eventhough the populations are relatively small. Water pollution is causing noticeable decline in other parts of Europe. Distribution range extends east across Anatolia and Iran to south-eastern Turkmenistan, where it inhabits higher altitudes, whereas lowlands are too dry for its survival. It is also absent from Mediterranean islands.

History In 2005-2006 the teachers went on strike to increase funds for the schools and smaller class sizes (average of 30 students per class) because it was becoming difficult to teach the students. To help the teachers, the schools now employ resource teachers. In 2014 the government of Quebec planned to move 66 schools from the Commission scolaire de Montr√©al (CSDM) to the CSMB. That year the school board chairperson Diane Lamarche-Venne stated that the CSMB was unaware that Quebec planned to move the schools and that it had never lobbied for that.Wilton, Katherine. \\"Commission scolaire Marguerite- Bourgeoys ready to accept school board reorganization\\" (Archive).

He was promoted to lieutenant in January 1918 and was awarded the Military Cross in the 1919 Birthday Honours. Following the war he resigned his commission and matriculated to Brasenose College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made three appearances in first-class cricket for Oxford University, playing against the Gentlemen of England and the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team in 1919, and the British Army cricket team in 1920. He scored 26 runs in his three matches and took 3 wickets. After graduating from Oxford, Keay became a schoolmaster. He gave evidence in the 1953 trial of Miles Giffard, whom he had taught at Rugby School, testifying to Giffard's strange behaviour whilst a pupil. Keay died at Swanage in August 1981.

He remained in the position of assistant until 1883 when he passed the professor's exam in physics, mechanics and astronomy. In the same year, he was appointed professor of physics at the First Belgrade Gymnasium. During several decades of work, in addition to the issue of electricity and its use-value, he was engaged in research in the field of physics, mechanics, astronomy, as well as new technical discoveries: colour photography, refrigeration and other fields. In the period from 1883 to 1887, as a cadet of the Ministry of War, he studied and worked in the most famous astronomical and meteorological observatories in Europe such as the University of Berlin, Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology based in Hamburg, Paris Observatory, Astronomy Tower of the Sorbonne, Royal Greenwich Observatory in England, and the Pulkovo Observatory. Due to his performance and results, he received an invitation from the Paris Observatory to participate in a scientific research expedition to study the Sun in Petrovsk, where he participated in the study of the total solar eclipses, and two years later in another scientific research expedition to study the Sun and thermal radiation and infrared light in the Sahara. During that time, and somewhat later, he published several scientific papers in astrophysics in the editions of the French Academy of Sciences. These were the first modern scientific works in astronomy among Serbs in general.–à–æ–≤–∞–Ω –°–∏–º–æ–≤—ô–µ–≤–∏—õ: –ê—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—ò–∞ –¥–æ 1947. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ, –ü—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—É–ø—ô–µ–Ω–æ 4 Maj 2013. He often stayed in European cities where he participated in gatherings and exhibitions in various fields of science and technology, gathered knowledge and experience which, immediately afterwards, he tried to transfer to his country. He is responsible for the introduction of the first electric lighting in Belgrade and the then Serbia, at the end of the eighties of the 19th century, instead of the previously prevailing gas lighting. This made Belgrade one of the first capitals in Europe with electric lighting. In 1887 he became a full professor of physics and mechanics at the Serbian Military Academy, and in 1893 he became a full professor of experimental physics at the Visoka ≈°kola in Belgrade. In the middle of the first decade of the twentieth century, he became a full professor at the University of Belgrade, and in 1909 he became the dean of the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade. In 1913, he was appointed rector of the University of Belgrade and remained in that position until 1921.He was a colleague and admirer of Scientist Nikola Tesla and wrote the book entitled \\"Nikola Tesla and his discoveries\\", published in Belgrade in 1894. For several years, he worked on studying the possibilities of building power plants in Serbia, and especially the possibilities of using watercourses for that purpose, he studied the hydropower potentials of rivers in Serbia. He is credited with the construction of the first hydroelectric power plants in Serbia: U≈æice on ƒêetinja, Vuƒçje on Vuƒçjanka, Ni≈° on Ni≈°ava, Veliko Gradiste on Pek, Vlasotince on Vlasina, Ivanjica on Moravica, Ra≈°ka on Ibar, Zajeƒçar on Timok and so on. In early October 1893, Stanojeviƒá also constructed the first Belgrade hydrothermal power plant using Tesla's polyphase system in the district of Dorcol, and he became the first person to send audio (wireless telephony) by means of electromagnetic waves (radio demonstration) in 1908 in Belgrade. In his lectures at the old Institute of Physics at the Visoka ≈°kola, in June 1901, Stanojeviƒá concluded that ... The waterfall that has the most power in itself is without a doubt the waterfall of Vuƒçjanski Potok near the village of Vuƒçja, about 17 kilometres away from Leskovac. At that place, the waterfalls in several jumps, which are not far from each other and bear various names such as Dev Kazan, Djokin Vir, etc., from a height of more than 100 meters. The amount of water in small water is about half a cubic meter, and the power that this waterfall can give will take out about 500 steam horses. At the request of several respectable citizens of Leskovac, I studied the issue of bringing that force to Leskovac and found that it could be done in a relatively easy way. For the first plant, 500 steam horses would be taken, divided into two turbines and a dynamo machine of 150 horses each. That way, if necessary, only one turbine would work, or both, and in some cases, they would serve as a reserve for each other. Stanojeviƒá was a proponent of universal education and critical of the Central Powers for targeting institutions of higher learning. His range of interests was wide, according to the books he wrote. http://servo.aob.rs/eeditions/CDS/Srpsko%20bugarska%20konferencija/7/pdfs/p08.pdf ƒêorƒëe M.

The organisation is composed of a network of law enforcement, governance and development practitioners, who share the objective of developing innovative strategies and responses to organized crime. In July 2020, the network counted 500 experts. The organisation was launched formally at the United Nations headquarters, in New York in September 2013. It was initially established with funding and operational support from both the Governments of Norway and of Switzerland. The Global Initiative has offices in Geneva, Vienna, Cape Town, and Malta. The Global Initiative and its reports are regularly cited in publications such as the New York Times, Reuters, Time magazine, Forbes, the BBC, Der Spiegel, World Politic Review, and The Telegraph.  Governance  The Global Initiative Board for 2017-2020 is composed of Sarah F. Cliffe (Chair), and board members Rodrigo Avila, Gwen Boniface, Solange Ghernaouti, Misha Glenny, Marc Hofstetter, Kristin Kvigne, Nick Lewis, Moises Naim, Mary Jane C. Ortega and Gladwell Otieno. The leadership team is composed of Mark Shaw (Director) and Tuesday Reitano (Deputy Director).  Activities and partnerships  The Global Initiative has published numerous publications, reports and policy briefs on organised crime. It has published a report together with the World Wide Fund for Nature on combatting environmental crime. According to, the Global Initiative is the first organisation which analysed the risks and dangers associated with the infiltration of criminal organisations into the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a focus on the social and economic results. In March 2020, the organisation published a report of which the conclusions are summarised in the Wikipedia article on the Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime. The Global Initiative provides briefings to the United Nation Security Council, highlighting that the United Nations System needs a coherent, streamlined and strategic approach to combat organized crime and to reduce its negative impacts on peace and prosperity. Together with Poseidon Aquatic Resource Management Ltd., the Global Initiative developed an illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing index for coastal states, which measures the degree to which states are exposed to and effectively combat IUU fishing. The Global Initiative co-organizes workshops with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime focusing on non-governmental alliances and developing multi-stakeholder engagement, in the context of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC). Together with Babson College and the International Organization for Migration, the Global Initiative is a founder of the Responsible and Ethical Private Sector Coalition against Trafficking (RESPECT) initiative, which aims to find solutions to modern slavery in the public and private sectors.

History = Dutch East Indies (1938-1942)  On 1 July 1938, with the decision of the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, the eight kingdoms of Bali were re-established. The kings of Bali were inaugurated two days earlier in a ceremony at the Besakih Temple. The kings of the eight kingdoms became members of the Paruman Agung, which was established on 30 September 1938. During this era, the Paruman Agung was composed of nine members, consisting of the speaker, who was the Resident of Bali and Lombok, and the eight members. Each king was assisted by two advisors. The Paruman Agung also had a secretary, who was appointed by the members and with the approval of the speaker.  Japanese occupation (1942‚Äì1945)  During the Japanese occupation, the Paruman Agung was not dissolved, but became inactive. There were no changes relating to the composition.  Dissolution of the Paruman Agung (1945‚Äì1946)  After the independence of Indonesia, the government of Indonesia began to set up the regional government in Bali. The Province of Lesser Sunda, which has its capital in Singaraja, was formed. On 18 August 1945, President Sukarno appointed Ida Bagus Putra Manuaba as the Speaker of the Indonesian National Committee of Lesser Sunda, and on 22 August 1945, Sukarno appointed I Gusti Ketut Pudja as the Governor of Lesser Sunda. Pudja returned to Bali on 23 August 1945, and discussed the future of Bali and its political structure. Pudja promised that the government in the kingdoms would be run by the Regional Indonesian National Committee in cooperation with the kings, and the government in Bali would be run by the Indonesian National Committee of Lesser Sunda in cooperation with the Governor of Lesser Sunda. Even though Pudja thought that the power share was a fair share between the republic and kingdoms in Bali, some of the kings broke their trust with the Republic of Indonesia, and eventually refused to cooperate with the republican government. Meanwhile, the Dutch, under the AMACAB (Allied Military Administration-Civil Affairs Branch), who had arrived in Bali between October 1945 and February 1946, promised the kings that they would obtain full power in return for their rejection of the independence of Indonesia and support of the Dutch. The alliance between the Dutch and the local kings made the republican government weaker, and on 29 January 1946, Pudja handed over its power to the Council of Kings. The Paruman Agung was formed shortly after.  Pre-election Paruman Agung (1946‚Äì1948)  Anak Agung Nyoman Pandji Tisna (pictured) was elected as the Speaker of the Paruman Agung. On 4 February 1946, the structure of the Paruman Agung was re-formed, with an additional 28 members and the removal of the Resident of Bali and Lombok from the position. The total membership of the Paruman Agung was set at 36 persons, and the King of Buleleng, Anak Agung Nyoman Pandji Tisna, was appointed as speaker. I Gusti Bagus Oka was appointed as the secretary of the Paruman Agung. On 4 June 1946, the Chief Commanding Officer (CCO) of the AMACAB summoned the Paruman Agung to a meeting in Denpasar. The CCO informed them about the Malino Conference, and stated that the parliament must elect two delegates to the conference. The Paruman Agung elected Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati and I Gusti Bagus Oka as the delegates. The Paruman Agung also demanded that a group of advisors should assist the delegates, and thus a group of three, consisting of Pandji Tisna, Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung, and Gde Panetja, was sent to advise the delegates. The Paruman Agung decided that Bali should be a separate state inside the federal Indonesia. The decision was sent to the delegates, so that the delegates demanded a separate state. During the conference, the leader of the conference, Hubertus van Mook, disagreed with the demand, and stated that Bali should be included in a State of East Indonesia. The delegates returned to Bali and debated the decision by van Mook to include Bali in the State of East Indonesia. The Paruman Agung agreed to change their decision, and the delegates were sent back to the conference with the new decision. On 4 November 1946, the Paruman Agung held another session to elect seven delegates for the Denpasar Conference: Anak Agung Ngurah Ketut Jelantik, Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati, I Gusti Bagus Oka, Gde Panetja, Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung, Made Mendra, and Anak Agung Nyoman Pandji Tisna. The conference resulted in the establishment of the State of East Indonesia on 24 December 1946, and Soekawati was elected as the President of the State of East Indonesia. The Paruman Agung met again on 28 December 1946 with the agenda of the formulation of a new law for the election of the parliament. The kings in the Paruman Agung would be separated to form a new body, called the Council of Kings. The law would give Paruman Agung powers to formulate laws, and the speaker of the Paruman Agung would be chosen by its members. In addition to that, the Paruman Agung would consist of 40 members, with 34 being elected and 6 being appointed from the minority groups in Bali.  Election = Regulations  The Paruman Agung decided that the electoral system should be an indirect election, and the people would vote for an electoral college (wali pemilih), which in turn would elect the members of the parliament. Those who had the right to vote were those who had already paid the road tax. Those who were imprisoned or in debt were not allowed to vote. Furthermore, only those who were above 25 years old and were able to read and write could vote. The voting districts were divided by perbekelans (group of villages), and every 1000 voters in a perbekelan would be represented by an elector. The Buleleng, Badung, Gianyar, and Karangasem kingdoms were each represented by 5 members in the Paruman Agung, while the Djembrana, Klungkung, and Bangli kingdoms were each represented by 3 members.  Turnout  Elections were held in several phases, from 19 until 26 April 1947. The first phase of the elections was held in the Tabanan Kingdom from 19 to 20 April, while the last phase of the election was held in the Badung Kingdom on 26 April.  Rejection of results  On 9 June and 10 July 1947, the Council of Kings held a meeting in which they declared the election results in Badung and Buleleng null and void. They stated that the electors from the region consisted of pro-republicans (whom they termed \\"extremists\\") and that the extremists had exerted pressure which prevented free elections. Even though the election results were annulled, there were demands for a new democratically elected Paruman Agung. Thus, on September 1948, a new election was held for the Badung and Buleleng kingdoms.  Post-election Paruman Agung  On 15 November 1948, the new democratically elected members of the Paruman Agung were installed. The inauguration was attended by the kings in Bali, the Resident of Bali and Lombok, and the troop commander of the Dutch forces. In accordance with the law, the Paruman Agung nominated three candidates for speaker of Paruman Agung. The nominees were I Gusti Ktut Ngurah, Ida Bagus Putra Manuaba, and the Anak Agung Nyoman Pandji Tisna. Pandji Tisna, the previous speaker, was elected to the position. I Gusti Putu Gde Kuntri was appointed by the parliament as secretary of the Paruman Agung.  Powers  According to the law regarding the political structure of Bali, the Paruman Agung has four main functions: proposing a bill (petition and initiative), amending the bill (amendment), and questioning the government (interpellation). In addition to that, the members of the Paruman Agung are granted parliamentary immunity. In practice, according to I Made Sendra, a lecturer from the Udayana University, the Council of Kings is more powerful than the Paruman Agung. The Paruman Agung rarely uses their initiative and interpellation rights, thus making the parliament merely an advisory body. He stated that this causes no real separation of powers between the Council of Kings and the Paruman Agung.  Dissolution  After the formation of the United States of Indonesia, demands to dissolve the Paruman Agung increased. At a congress in Campuhan Ubud from 14 to 17 April 1950, one of the demands was to replace the Paruman Agung with a more democratic legislature. Thus, on 8 June 1950, the Paruman Agung held an emergency meeting to form an executive body, consisting of five members, based on the demands of the people. The Paruman Agung appointed three formateurs for the executive body. These formateurs would appoint two members from the parliament and two members from outside the parliament, and the chairman of the executive body was the chairman of the Council of Kings. The executive body consisted of Anak Agung Gede Oka as its chairman, I Gusti Putu Merta handling political affairs, I Gusti Gede Subamia handling social affairs, I Wayan Dangin handling economic affairs, and I Wayan Bhadra handling general affairs. This executive body was still responsible to the Paruman Agung and the Council of Kings. Several weeks after the executive council was formed, the Putuhena Cabinet in the State of Indonesia enacted a new law regarding political structures in all regions of the State of East Indonesia. The Minister of Internal Affairs, Lanto Daeng Pasewang, went to Bali to explain how the law should be implemented. Thus, on 7 August 1950, the government of Bali formed a new committee for the implementation of the law. The committee consisted of five members representing pro-republican political groups: I Gde Putra Kamayana from the Indonesian National Party, Raden Sujono from Masyumi, I Gde Puger from KPNI, and the pro-federalist representatives I Gusti Putu Merta from the government and Anak Agung Gede Djelantik from the kings. The committee decided to dissolve the Paruman Agung, and on 25 September 1950, the Paruman Agung was dissolved, and the Bali Regional People's Representative Council was installed.

The concept of the ‚Äúfeminist avantgarde‚Äù  Mainstream art history has yet to consider the feminist art movement of the second half of the twentieth century as part of the post-war ‚Äúavantgarde,‚Äù which normally includes, for example, Pop Art, Fluxus and Viennese Actionism.Tabea Grzeszyk: Feministische Avantgarde. Die ironische Aneignung m√§nnlicher Posen. In: Deutschlandfunk Kultur. May 14 2015. (deutschlandfunkkultur.de) One exception to this neglect, as pointed out by Schor, is Lawrence Alloway, whose 1976 article Women‚Äôs Art in the '70s made the claim: ‚ÄúThe women‚Äôs movement in art can be described as avantgarde, since its protagonists are united in pushing for a change in the existing social order within the art world.‚ÄúIn: Art in America. 64, May-June 1976, pages 64‚Äì72. Translated and quoted by Gabriele Schor: Feministische Avantgarde. Kunst der 1970er Jahre aus der Sammlung Verbund, Wien. page 18. As late as the 1990s, feminist art of the 1970s was still the subject of occasional mockery, dubbed ‚Äúhousewives‚Äô complaints.‚Äù Only later would the art-historical importance of the movement be recognized. The 2007 exhibition WACK! Art and Feminist Revolution, which featured the work of 120 international women artists, represented the first comprehensive intercontextualization of art and feminism. The exhibition was shown in prominent institutions, including the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A New York Times critic wrote: ‚ÄúCurators and critics have increasingly come to see that feminism has generated the most influential art impulses of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. There is almost no new work that has not in some way been shaped by it. [‚Ä¶]‚ÄùHolland Cotter: Feminist Art Finally takes Center Stage. Translated and quoted by Gabriele Schor. In: The New York Times. Januar 29 2007, page 19. (nytimes.com) Although the movement‚Äôs pioneering historical achievement is uncontested, German-language art-historical reference works ‚Äì including the renowned Metzler publications ‚Äì often fail to mention feminist art under the rubric of ‚Äúavantgarde art.‚Äù In using the term ‚ÄúFeminist Avantgarde,‚Äù not least for the exhibition title, Schor combined the desires: to emphasize the pioneering achievements of 1970s female artists, to expand the overwhelmingly male avantgarde, and to anchor this revisionist account within the history of art.Gabriele Schor: Feministische Avantgarde. Kunst der 1970er Jahre aus der Sammlung Verbund, Wien. Prestel Verlag, M√ºnchen/ London/ New York 2015, , pages 17‚Äì19.  Characteristics of 1970s feminist art  Feminist artists in Europe and in North and South America focused on particular themes: the denunciation of women‚Äôs situation in family, social and political contexts, women‚Äôs own self-representations, the liberation of female bodies from aesthetic idealization, and the expansion of the private sphere into public life. Feminist artists, reflecting on these issues in visual form, should be regarded as pioneers of artistic expression on these issues. Feminist art of the 1970s deconstructed images of women which had, for centuries and even millennia, been almost exclusively formulated by men. They created new representations of women in visual art. Feminist artists acted in accordance with the popular slogan of the women‚Äôs movement: the supposedly private and personal was made public, and shown to be politically relevant.Feministische Avantgarde der 1970er Jahre aus der Sammlung VERBUND, Wien. In: Kunst und Film. March 16 2018. Feminist artists primarily used new media like photography, film and video, as well as installations, actions and performances. They regarded these media as less preconditioned by male- dominated art history than either painting or sculpture. At a time when photography, and certainly not video, were not yet generally recognized as art forms, these media allowed female artists to express themselves independently of the art historical tradition. New media enabled their works to address contemporary themes ‚Äì including gender roles and the politics of the body ‚Äì more quickly and in a more immediately relevant way.Hamburger Kunsthalle. Feministische Avantgarde der 1970er-Jahre, Deutschlandfunk, March 14 2015.  Exhibition series  The Feminist Avantgarde exhibitions have encompassed more than six hundred works by female artists born between 1915 and 1958. They come from across the globe, from Western and Eastern Europe, North America and Latin America, including numerous African-American and Asian artists. The works were collected on the basis of research begun by Gabriele Schor in 2004 for the Verbund Collection in Vienna. Alongside works by well-known artists, and photographic documentation of their actions, the exhibition series also includes works forgotten for decades, by both known and unknown artists.Neue Ausstellung im ZKM Karlsruhe.

Many of the works exhibited aim to banish and overcome traditional roles ascribed to women. Feminist artists understood the roles of housewife, spouse and mother as restrictive, rendering women into objects and even victims of patriarchal society. Through their art and actions, feminist artists sought to attain more autonomy, creating new images of women, including a more free experience of their own sexuality. Female artists involved in the movement made use of everyday activities, including housework, family life, motherhood and ‚Äúmaking oneself beautiful (for men),‚Äù in order to distance themselves from these phenomena, to grow beyond them, playing with and re-signifying these activities. Many female artists found dramatic images to express their rebellion against being reduced to the roles of housewife and mother. In 1975, Birgit J√ºrgenssen draped herself with a kitchen apron in the form of an oven; Renate Eisenegger ironed a corridor; Karin Mack lay prone on an ironing board; Annegret Soltau tied herself up with threads, while other female artists did the same with ropes. Whether using clothes pegs or Scotch tape, many female artists used everyday objects as a form of bondage, often to the point of inflicting pain on themselves.Die Ausstellung ‚ÄûFeministische Avantgarde‚Äú in Karlsruhe ZKM.

Feminist art of the 1970s marked the first attempt to comprehensively address female eroticism from the point of view of women. This frequently took them very far from ideals of beauty as normalized by society, and often directly contested those ideals. Some female artists (including Penny Slinger, Renate Bertlmann, and VALIE EXPORT) staged their bodies and their vulvas in original ways, partly humorous and cheerful, partly (self-)aggressive. Judy Chicago‚Äôs ‚ÄúDinner Party‚Äù presented a table full of vulva-symbols in the form of painted plates and ceramic reliefs. In 1972, rebelling against the compulsion to be beautiful, Ana Mendieta pressed her face against a glass plane, so as to squash and distort it. A few years later, while unaware of Mendieta‚Äôs work, Katalin Ladik did something similar in Yugoslavia. Other female artists made work relating to allegorical statues and paintings. For centuries, men had constructed these female figures, which were either beautiful allegories standing, for example, for ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù or ‚ÄúWisdom,‚Äù or else represented female saints and goddesses. In her video performances, Ulrike Rosenbach used superimpositions, including Botticelli‚Äôs painting The Birth of Venus. In ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think I am an Amazon?‚Äù Rosenbach shot arrows at a reproduction of Stefan Lochner‚Äôs Madonna of the Rose Bower and thus also at herself, since her own face was projected onto the figure of Mary. In this way, her image mixes that of the pure, asexual Mary with that of an Amazon: Rosenbach intended to deconstruct the clich√©s of these two female images. The photographer Cindy Sherman was another artist to go particularly far in using roleplay to undo outdated stereotypes of women. In addition, the works of 1970s feminist artists were the first to take on board a central notion of French post-structuralism: they questioned the Western notion of the subject, which imagined the human being (especially the white, heterosexual male) as a unified, self-aware being with an unambiguous identity.Feministische Avantgarde-Kunst: Die wilden Jahre des Aufstands. In: Frankfurter Allgemeine. February 14 2018. In this way, feminist works and actions critiqued the male- dominated image of women, but also fundamentally understood human subjectivity as something more transparent and mutable. One typical move made by 1970s feminist art was, for example, the ironic appropriation and display of ‚Äúmale,‚Äù macho poses, using their own female, partly naked bodies. In doing so, they transgressed conceptions of individuals and societies which were based on two starkly differentiated genders.

The bust was dedicated at the Lancaster County Courthouse on the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus‚Äô discovery of America. Designed by Art Research and Technology of Lancaster at a cost of $13,000, the bronze bust depicts Columbus with chin-length hair, wearing a period hat and a pleated shirt and cloak. It was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in 1995. History The bust of Columbus was commissioned after a local Italian immigrant, Antonio Palumbo, wanted to give a token of appreciation to the city of Lancaster. Initially wanting to share his Italian heritage with a statue of Christopher Columbus, a fundraiser only brought in sufficient funds to pay for an over-sized bust. The bust was designed and built by Art Research and Technology of Lancaster, and dedicated on October 12, 1992 on Lenox Lane behind the county courthouse. Controversy Since its initial unveiling, where protesters gathered during the dedication, the bust of Columbus has been a source of controversy in Lancaster. Since then, numerous attempts to remove the bust sparked public discourse. Removal of the bust came under discussion in 2017 when local activists called it \\"insulting to Native Americans\\". At the time, the Lancaster City Council voted with unanimous support to keep the statue. Talks of removing the bust were reignited in June 2020 following the George Floyd protests, during which the bust was vandalized. It was toppled from its podium in mid-July 2020 during ongoing protests as well.

The player controls Beatris Summers, a young private detective hired to investigate the murder of a wealthy robotics tycoon. The game is described as a neo-noir and psychological thriller that takes its inspirations from 8-bit video games such as those on the Game Boy Color, utilizing a monochrome color pallet and limited pixel art aesthetic. The game was released commercially on July 31, 2020 on Steam and itch.io.  Gameplay  Lockheart Indigo is a top-down adventure game where you traverse levels and navigate obstacles similar to the 2D installments of The Legend of Zelda, seeking out keys and opening locked doors. Unlike most games in its genre, there is no combat system. Instead, potential culprits are interrogated in a conversation system that uses facts, evidence, and special abilities to get closer to the killer and progress the game.  Synopsis  The game stars Beatris Summers, a young cynical private detective who must investigate the murder of the late robotics tycoon, Evan Volkov. Beatris is hired by the victim's widow, Aya Volkov, to investigate the residents of the Volkov estate and discover which of them committed the crime. Upon traversing further into the mansion, Beatris finds herself tangled up in a deeper and more dangerous mystery.  Development and release  Lockheart Indigo was developed independently by Harmless using the RPG Maker MV game engine. Development started in 2017 after creating the prototype Machines That Bleed. Prior to the game's full release on Steam (July 2020), it was available for free as a beta version throughout its development on itch.io.

Knight was born at Eltham in March 1914. He began his early education in Eastbourne at St Andrew's Prep, from which he gained a scholarship to Uppingham School. He excelled in Eton Fives at Uppingham, in which he was public schools champion in 1932. From Uppingham he went up to Wadham College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first- class cricket for Oxford University, making his debut against Leicestershire in 1933. He played first-class cricket for Oxford until 1935, making eleven appearances. Playing as a wicket-keeper, he scored 189 runs in his eleven matches, at an average of 13.50 and with a high score of 87, which was his only score above fifty. Behind the stumps he took 18 catches and made five stumpings. He gained a blue in cricket and a half-blue in Eton Fives. After graduating from Oxford, he joined the Colonial Service. He was initially stationed in Northern Rhodesia, before being transferred to Barotseland, close to the border with Portuguese Angola. When the Second World War began, he was stationed in the Kalabo near the Zambezi. At the declaration of war he walked 50 miles to Mongu before flying to Lusaka, where he joined the Northern Rhodesia Regiment. Knight saw action during the war against the Italians during their Invasion of British Somaliland, with Knight taking part in the Battle of Tug Argan. With the British defeat in the campaign, the regiment was transferred to British Ceylon, to defend against a possible Japanese invasion. Following the war, he returned to Northern Rhodesia where he became private secretary to Governor Sir John Waddington in 1947, the same year in which he helped to organise the royal visit of George VI. He became district commissioner of Mumbwa in 1949 and later held senior positions in the Northern Rhodesia Government. Knight retired to Durban, where he died in May 2009. He was predeceased by his wife, Babs, who died in 2007.

Life  Farquharson was born in 1884. In 1908 she graduated with a master's degree from the University of Glasgow. She came to notice before World War I as a leader in the women's suffrage movement. In 1909 she was arrested as a suffragette and jailed for five days in Holloway Prison. She was a salaried organiser for the Women's Freedom League in Liverpool with Mary Adelaide Broadhurst. However the WFL failed to establish a voice distinct from the WSPU. Money was requested for a full-time organiser in Liverpool, but the salaried posts in Liverpool were not supported after January 1909. In 1911 the National Political League, NPL, was formed. The league was an apolitical group supporting reform. Suffragette and funder Janie Allan, socialist Ethel Annakin Snowden, suffragette Laura Ainsworth, MP George Lansbury and John Scurr were amongst the league's supporters. She was the secretary and the NPL was based in St James Street in London. In 1913 they organised a meeting at Kingsway Hall where 1,500 people including George Bernard Shaw attended to discuss and protest the Force-feeding of hunger striking suffragettes. The meeting was reported word for word to the Home Office. During the war the NPL created the National Land Council. This body created eleven locations in Britain where women could be trained to work on the land. The National Political League changed its name in 1917 to the National Political Reform League. In 1918 Farquharson was one of the first women to stand (unsuccessfully) to be a member of parliament. By 1922 the NPL had aligned themselves with supporting the Palestinians and Arabs in general. It would appear that the NPL were supporting the Arab cause as they objected to the UK governments support for Zionism and they wanted to resist that and the rise of Bolshevikism. From March to May 1930 the British police kept her and the anti-semite fascist Robert Gordon Canning under observation to monitor their interactions with a delegation sent to London by the executive committee of the Palestine Arab Congress (ECPAC). The NPL was funded by leading Muslims and UK government cabinet members were advised to avoid it. The league were trying to undermine or overturn the Balfour Declaration. Broadhurst died in 1928. From 1929 the NPL continued its work and it was in touch with the Muslim‚ÄìChristian Alliance of Palestine. A 1937 report intelligence report noted that \\"Miss Margaret Milne Farquharson [was] obtaining money from affluent Indians and Arabs\\". She was using this money to support the Pan- Islamists and the point of view of the Palestinians.

Among the more than 400 international participants from nearly 80 countries were 20 heads of state, 70 foreign and defence ministers and 30 CEOs of large companies. The German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen delivered the opening speech. In her speech, she explained Germany's willingness to assume international leadership responsibilities. It consisted of \\"leadership from the centre\\", the minister explained, and not one \\"with Pickelhaube\\" \\\\- which could also imply \\"fighting together\\". Based on German history, von der Leyen derived the commitment of her country to defend human rights but added however that the German population was \\"cautious\\" on this issue.  Ukraine  In regards to the conflict in Ukraine, the defence minister Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of leading an \\"undeclared war\\". However, she spoke out against a supply of weapons to Ukraine. Also on the opening day, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to relent in the conflict. \\"The Cold War is history, and so it should remain,\\" Stoltenberg said. He reaffirmed NATO's dedication to repel every attack, but also warned of the long-term consequences of cutbacks in defence budgets upon security. A meeting between Stoltenberg and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during the conference was described as \\"frosty\\". German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaking at 51st MSC German Chancellor Angela Merkel came to Munich immediately after a joint mediation mission with French President Fran√ßois Hollande in Moscow, negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In her speech, Merkel rejected the idea of supplying weapons to Ukraine and spoke in favour of a diplomatic solution, and the revitalization of the Minsk Protocol, since the conflict could not be resolved militarily. She pointed out that the Russian policy had been \\"disillusioning\\" in the conclusion of the agreement, and also drew on her personal experiences in East Germany during the construction and the fall of the Berlin Wall as an example of a successful non-military solution to a conflict. Responding to repeated calls for supplying weapons to Ukraine, the Chancellor stated: \\"I am very doubtful.\\" According to Merkel, Putin could not be moved to make more concessions by more weapons and soldiers. After her speech, Merkel held a trilateral meeting with US Vice President Joe Biden and the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko. At the conference, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov accused the West of deliberately intensifying the conflict in Ukraine. Russia itself bears no responsibility for the conflict, Lavrov stated. In his speech he specifically blamed the United States for the massive tensions in the relationship between the West and Russia. Lavrov accused Washington of trying to reach global dominance and of infringing on international agreements in connection with the U.S. missile defence plans in Europe. The Russian Foreign Minister called the current situation a \\"turning point\\" in which the West must decide whether they want to \\"build a secure architecture with, without or against Russia\\". Lavrov spoke positively about the Franco-German peace efforts. German Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier (left) and US Secretary of State John Kerry Lavrov's speech was sharply criticized by German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. He asked Moscow to show more willingness to compromise and told Lavrov that his speech had not contributed to resolving the conflict. Steinmeier ruled out a quick end to the hostilities. Like Chancellor Merkel before, Steinmeier rejected weapon supplies to Ukraine and described them as \\"highly risky\\" and \\"counterproductive\\". The German Foreign Minister also stated that the most important task ahead would be containing the conflict in order to gain scope for political solutions. He also emphasized that there could only be lasting security for Europe in cooperation with Russia; at the same time, Steinmeier declared that a positive future for Russia was only possible with Europe, not against Europe. US Secretary of State John Kerry stressed the close cooperation between the United States and Europe and declared that there were no divisions or differences over the Ukraine issue. Kerry also called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis and accused Russian President Putin of \\"brazen efforts\\" to destabilize eastern Ukraine. Philip M. Breedlove, Supreme Commander of NATO in Europe, who was previously skeptical about Western weapon supplies to Ukraine, stated at the conference that in case of a failure of negotiations and sanctions \\"the possibility of military options should not be excluded\\". At the same time, General Breedlove ruled out the deployment of ground troops.  Nuclear negotiations with Iran and the war on terror  In connection with negotiations about Iran's nuclear program, the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stated at the conference that he was opposed to a further extension of the current negotiations, which had a deadline of the end of March 2015. He spoke about the support from the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, for Tehran's nuclear negotiations, and called for lifting the sanctions against his country. The EU High Representative for the Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, expressed optimism on the progress of negotiations with Iran and spoke in Munich of a \\"historical opportunity\\" for resolving this conflict. During the security conference, Zarif and US Secretary of State Kerry came to direct negotiations twice. Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs, Yuval Steinitz, warned at the conference of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, should Iran obtain nuclear weapons. In the fight against the Islamic State terrorist group (IS), the Israeli minister urged Western countries to provide more military and financial support for Egypt, Jordan, the Kurds and moderate rebel forces in Syria. US Secretary of State Kerry reported in Munich that the international coalition against IS had already flown 2,000 air strikes against the terrorists since August 2012. The strikes had helped to liberate 700 square kilometres from IS control. In connection with the IS burning of the Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh alive, Kerry spoke of a \\"new level of depravity\\" and announced that the international community should relentlessly tackle terrorist groups like IS and Boko Haram.  Refugees  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Ant√≥nio Guterres, warned during a panel discussion about the dangers of the global refugee crises for peace and security. Guterres described the global security situation by saying: \\"We have no bipolar world, we have no multilateral world, we have a chaotic world.\\" Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International, accused the international community of failing to protect human rights and pleaded with the decisions made by the UN Security Council on human rights violations for a limitation of the veto. Shetty criticized the EU, that its 27 member states had taken in only 9,000 refugees from Syria, while the five neighboring countries of Syria needed to cope with 3.8 million war refugees. The Lebanese Prime Minister Tammam Salam described the situation in his country - which with its population of four million had taken 1.5 million refugees from Syria - as catastrophic. German Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd M√ºller agreed to supply the Lebanese government with further aid and called on the EU to take in additional refugees. During the panel discussion M√ºller highlighted the global imbalance between military expenditure in relation to developmental assistance. He received support for his statement from the Vice President of the German Bundestag, Claudia Roth. The collapse of global order was the subject of another panel discussion, in which Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Kumi Naidoo, international director of Greenpeace, and George Soros, investor and philanthropist, discussed the possibilities of a future new world order. Beforehand, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland had presented a proposal to reform the UN Security Council.

Plot Freddy Lupin is the young heir to a werewolf pack that has been protecting their local town for years. When he attempts to follow his family during their nightly patrol using a magical Moonstone, he inadvertently exposes the existence of werewolves to ice-cream truck owner Foxwell Cripp, and when Freddy's father, Flashheart Lupin, attempts to protect Freddy, Freddy ends up losing the Moonstone to Cripp and Flashheart is apparently killed when he falls off a cliff. With Flasheart dead, Freddy's uncle Hotspur becomes the new head of the werewolf clan, starting various new policies that include an increased dog-catching presence in the town, as werewolves have had a long history of disdain for dogs. Six years later, the time comes for Freddy to experience his first wolf transformation, but despite the encouragement of long-term housekeeper Mrs Mutton, he is humiliated when he turns into a dog (poodle, to be exact) instead. Faced with the disdain of his pack, Freddy is challenged to prove his wolf status by moonrise the next day or risk being banished. However, his efforts are curtailed from the beginning when Hotspur's children put a silver collar on him, preventing him turning back into human form, although he manages to escape the mansion. Hitching a lift into town on a passing truck, Freddy decides to try and retrieve the Moonstone from Cripp, who now runs a werewolf exhibition that has been covered by anti-werewolf defenses preventing the pack from retrieving it themselves. While searching in town, Freddy befriends Batty, a stray dog also known as 'Houndini' for her ability to consistently escape the dog-catchers, offering to give her access to his mansion's supply of meat if she helps him retrieve the ring from Cripp. After Batty gives him some tips on how to be more dog, she leads him to Cripp's exhibition. Freddy is briefly caught and examined by Cripp, but Batty is able to help him escape. Learning about Batty's past, when she was put out of a petshop after nobody bought her, Freddy plans to help her, but they are caught by the dogcatchers and sent to the Coldfax dog pound before he can do anything. Meanwhile, Cripp recognises the Lupin family crest from Freddy's silver collar, and is able to acquire a hair sample from Hotspur to confirm his suspicions. Hotspur visits the dog pound and retrieves the Moonstone, but decides to leave Freddy there so that he can become the official pack leader. In a cell with the temperamental Twitchy, the zen-style Hamish, and Bruno, who can only say \\"ball\\", Freddy accidentally admits his werewolf heritage, but after an escape attempt goes wrong, he takes the blame to save the dogs and is sent to a pit with 'the Beast', an unknown monster that supposedly eats dogs. As Hotspur prepares to implement his plan along with the pound's Commander to turn all the captured stray dogs into wigs, Freddy learns that the 'Beast' is actually his father; Flasheart was captured by the dog-catchers after he was injured by the fall, with Hotspur leaving him in Coldfax with a silver bracelet to keep him trapped in his wolf state. Batty and the other dogs are able to escape into the vents and help Freddy free his father. Mrs Mutton manages to track Freddy to the pound, she and Twitchy remaining to keep the Commander occupied and destroy the wig-making machine respectively. Freddy leads Flasheart and the dogs home to confront Hotspur, which also allows Freddy to return to human form after they are able to remove his silver collar. Their attempt to confront Hotspur is intercepted by Cripp, who attacks the other wolves with a mass of silver concentrate, but Freddy is able to stop Cripp's attack when he reveals that (contrary to Cripp's expectations) the wolves didn't kill him as a child. Having evaded Cripp's initial attack, Hotspur tries to attack while the other wolves are weakened by the silver, but the dogs are able to get the wolves to safety while Freddy lures his uncle to the mansion roof. Transforming back into a poodle in the moonlight and accepting his form, Freddy lets out a loud roar to affirm his status as an alpha wolf, sending Hotspur falling back into the mansion and affirming his failure as a leader. Sometime later, Freddy's reflections reveal that not only have werewolves and dogs gotten on better terms, but the pack has also opened the mansion up to all dogs, with Hotspur and his children reduced to dog- walkers and picking up after the mutts, while Cripp is an accepted part of life at the mansion, Batty being Freddy's particular pet/friend. Meanwhile, the commander has been arrested and Coldfax is presumably shut down. Flasheart has returned to his old role as pack leader, but assures Freddy that he is proud of him and believes he will be a good leader when the time comes.

The label was founded in 2017, with Reid's Palm Dreams as its debut release. The label was initially partnered with Reid's former label, Viva Records, but went independent in 2019. Its current roster of artists include Reid, Jackson, Nadine Lustre, Curtismith, Filipino-Ghanaian rapper Massiah, and trap artist Astro Kidd.  History  Careless was founded in 2017 by James Reid and Bret Jackson. Reid and Jackson first met as contestants in ‚ÄúPinoy Big Brother: Teen Clash‚Äù in 2010. After their stint at the show, they formed a band called WE ARE WHATEVER. They released a self-titled EP under ABS-CBN's Star Music. In 2013, Reid signed with Viva Records, under which, he released two albums. Reid wanted to have creative control over his music, so in 2017, he decided to release his LP Palm Dreams under his own record label. The name Careless began as an inside joke between friends after hearing a dubstep remix of ‚ÄúCareless Whisper.‚Äù When James was recording ‚ÄúPalm Dreams,‚Äù he was asked to give a name for the label. He came up with ‚ÄúCareless.‚Äù Discussing his reason for starting the label, Reid said, ‚ÄúI wanted creative control over my music, that was it,‚Äù he tells Rappler. ‚ÄúI felt like there was this gap in the music industry that I can help make a difference, that I can fill in, and I guess give more options to artists and create a platform that's more artist-centric instead of so much on the business.‚Äù Jackson, under his stage name KINGwAw, also released his debut album, Island City Poems in 2017. Both Reid and Jackson's albums featured collaborations with their fellow Viva-turned-Careless artist and Reid's then- girlfriend, Nadine Lustre. Reid also released three music videos within the year. The first one being for Cool Down, Palm Dream's carrier single. This was followed by a music video for Turning Up and The Life. All three music videos featured a guest appearance from Lustre, who also co-directed The Life with film director Petersen Vargas. In January 2018, Lustre released her first single under Careless, which was entitled St4y Up. In 2018, Curtismith, Sofia Romualdez, Astro Kidd, and Massiah joined Reid, Lustre, and Jackson in the team. Sofia joined the team after a chance meeting with Jackson in a studio. Bret was also responsible for bringing in Massiah and Astrokidd. Before joining Careless, Astro Kidd, who was a graduate of aircraft engineering and marketing, management was making music underground, while doing modeling stints. Massiah, on the other hand, was based in Dumaguete and was making waves in the city's underground music scene. As a collective, Careless released Careless Mixtape Vol. 1, which featured 15 tracks. The mixtape features a collaboration with Dumaguete-based band Midnasty for a track called Balenciaga, which features KINGwAw and Massiah. Sam Concepcion also collaborated with Reid and KINGwAw in I Ain't Ever Seen. In 2019, Curtismith released a 5-track EP entitled Dining Table. In the same year, Reid officially left Viva, and the label came with him, becoming fully independent. The team released their second collaborative collection, The Island City Playlist, which featured 14 tracks. The collection features collaborations with Just Hush, Kris Delano, Billy Davis, Mandaue Nights, Jetter, Jid Durano, Ruby Ibarra, Delinquent Society, Midnasty, and Korean rapper Avin. The release of the playlist coincides with the launch of Careless' entertainment platform Island City. In December, Careless held a contract signing for Lustre, Jackson, Massiah, Astro Kidd, and Curtismith. Currently, Reid serves as Chairman of the label, while Jackson is head of Artists & Repertoire. In August 2020, Careless collaborated with electronics brand OPPO for the release of the OPPO Reno4. Lustre, Massiah, Curtismith, Astro Kidd, and KINGwAw worked on a track called Clearly the Best You for the campaign and also appeared on the music video for the song.

The second single \\"Nerve\\" was released on March 20, 2020, after her Together at Home Instagram live concert. The third single \\"Loner\\" was released on May 15, 2020. The album was originally titled Black Sheep, but was changed. In an interview with IHeartRadio Canada, Yanofsky said that Turn Down the Sound was her first choice for the title of the album, but she faced a lot of criticism within her team from choosing the title. She then decided to change it back last minute because it was \\"true to herself\\". The album's title track \\"Turn Down the Sound\\" and \\"Bubbles\\" were written by Yanofsky with her friend Rod Temperton. \\"Bubbles\\" was the last song Temperton ever worked on, as it was his last song loaded on his music production software. Temperton nicknamed Yanofsky \\"Wobbles\\", which was why the song was named \\"Bubbles\\".  Recording  The album was recorded in two straight weeks with no days off at Warner Chappell Studios in New York City. It was recorded in April 2019 under the producers Roger Kleinmen and Zachary Seman who have worked with ASAP Rocky and Joey Badass before. Yanofsky called the recording a \\"very special experience\\" in an Instagram post. She also said that the recording did not feel like work at all, as it was genuinely fun. The first songs recorded were \\"High Note\\", and \\"Throwing Stones\\". \\"Throwing Stones\\" was recorded with musician Remy using a Wurlitzer.

The purpose of PNFS is to monitor, protect, and improve the footpath network of the North Midlands and North West of England, including the Peak District National Park. The organisation is the oldest existing regional footpath society in the UK. The Peak District & Northern Counties Footpaths Preservation Society was established on 16 August 1894 in the Young Men's Christian Association Hall, Peter Street, Manchester (now St George's House). It had evolved from The Manchester Association for the Preservation of Ancient Public Footpaths, which was founded in 1826. PNFS has over 100 volunteer footpath inspectors who are assigned to parishes across the counties of Cheshire, Derbyshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside, Staffordshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. They walk along their parishes' footpaths periodically to check for any problems, which they report to the local authority responsible for the footpaths concerned. PNFS often helps the authorities to fix problems promptly. Local authorities in the region are legally obliged to notify PNFS of any proposals affecting rights of way, in order that PNFS can uphold the interests of walkers. PNFS signpost near Baslow in Derbyshire The charity has installed over 500 numbered signposts and built dozens of footbridges as part of its ongoing programme to improve walking routes in the region. The first cast iron signposts were erected in 1905 and 20 are still standing from before World War I. PNFS publishes a regular magazine called Signpost. The Irregulars group of the Long Distance Walkers Association (LDWA) organises a programme of weekly walks and in 2019 it became affiliated to PNFS. In 1994, UK Parliament passed a motion congratulating PNFS on its centenary for its work over 100 years, improving access to the countryside.

It was founded by a small group of Lipka Tatars, originating from the Bia≈Çystok region of Poland. This was the first Muslim organization in New York state. History=Beginnings Small-scale Muslim immigration to the United States began in 1840, with the arrival of Yemenis and Turks, and lasted until World War I. Most of the immigrants, from Arab areas of the Ottoman Empire, came with the purpose of making money and returning to their homeland. Some of these immigrants settled in the United States permanently. Nonetheless, the population of Muslims in the United States was small in the first half of the 20th century, and many of these first immigrants assimilated and did not leave create any lasting Muslim religious institutions. Lipka Tatars have been a fixture of Poland's ethnic landscape since the 14th century, with many gaining the privileges of nobility in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Lipka Tatars settlements were located in northeast Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, south-east Latvia and Ukraine, with about 10,000 to 15,000 Lipka Tatars still living in Poland, Belarus, and Lithuania. Lipka Tatars in these communities followed their Polish neighbors in immigrating to the United States, and subsequently settled close to the Polish enclave of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. This community formally organized themselves as the American Mohammedan Society in 1907. 104 Powers Street When the American Mohammedan Society bought 104 Powers Street in 1931 along with two adjacent lots, the organization became the first corporate body to purchase land in New York City with the express purpose of practicing Islam. An article in a 1935 issue of The Muslim World Journal describes 104 Powers Street as a three-story wooden building that is the ‚Äúonly real mosque which exists today in America.\\" Time Magazine wrote about the mosque in a feature on Ramadan in its November 15th issue in 1937: The American Mohammedan Society is the fifth owner of the property, which has served as a church, a District Assembly Clubhouse for the Democratic Party, as well as a greenhouse. The structure was originally constructed as the Powers Street Methodist Episcopal Church, and the interior still resembles a Christian worship space today, with three short steps leading up to an altar on the first floor that the Tatars converted into a minbar. Congregants stand diagonally to pray and a makeshift partition separates the women‚Äôs prayer area from the men‚Äôs section; unlike conventional mosques that face the Kaaba in Mecca, 104 Powers Street is not a purpose-built mosque. Present The Lipka Tatar community in Brooklyn has shrunk dramatically since then. These days, the mosque usually only opens up for weddings and funerals, presided over by a part-time Imam of Bulgarian descent who lives in Long Island.

Morphology Cheloniellon range about 20 centimeters in body length (excluding appendages). The flattened, ovoid body compose of 11 tergites (dorsal exoskeleton), all but the posteriormost are laterally expanded and covered the appendages underneath each of them. The boundaries between tergites have a radiated appearance. Dorsal surface of the first tergite have a pair of kidney-shaped eyes. Based on the differentiation of corresponding appendages, the first 2 tergites and the remaining 9 tergites were interpreted as those of cephalon (head) and trunk, respectively. Contray to the widely-referred reconstruction by St√ºrmer & Bergstr√∂m (1978), but as most of the Cheloniellids, There is no evidence of telson (a medial tail-like terminal structure) in any described fossil materials.Wendruff, Andrew James, et al. \\"New cheloniellid arthropod with large raptorial appendages from the Silurian of Wisconsin, USA.\\" BioRxiv (2018): 407379. Underneath the tergites were numerous pairs of appendages. The anteriormost appendage pair were antennae, followed by a pair of specialized second appendages that bore spines and esthetasc-like brushes, and 4 pairs of leg-like appendages that have overlapped gnathobases (jaw-like structure on leg base). The mouth was covered by a labrum with spiny surface, situated between the second appendages and the first gnathobasic appendages. The last gnathobasic appendage pair and the remaining 5 appendage pairs anterior to it were interpreted as corresponding to the second tergite and first tergite, respectively. Appendages posterior to the cephalon were 8 pairs of biramous appendages (each compose of a leg-like endopod and a lobe-like exopod) and a pair of furcae, corresponding to the remaining 9 trunk tergites. Paleoecology Cheloniellon may had been a benthic predator, using its gnathobases to crushing prey while the spiny labrum may help leading food items toward the mouth opening. The specialized second appendages are too fragile to be raptorial, instead it may had played a tactile role, sensing the property and position of food item. Each of the endopod and exopod of trunk appendages may had locomotory and respiratory function, respectively. Classification Cheloniellon is a genus of Cheloniellida, an extinct arthropod taxon that have a controversial phylogenetic position. It was previously thought to be chelicerate-related, but later studies repeatedly suggests it as a member of Artiopoda, forming the clade Vicissicaudata with Aglaspidida and related genera. Within Cheloniellida, Cheloniellon branched next to Neostrabops but basal to Triopus and Duslia.

Climate  The climate is tropical and the village is surrounded by dense forests. Between May and September it rains a lot in the village.  Population  Languages in Kisenge (2019) Religions in Kisenge (2018) There are no accurate data on the village's population. However, it is estimated that the village has 3,500 people. The vast majority of the village's population is Catholic Christian, however there are small minorities of Sunni Muslims and traditional African religions. Until 1940 the overwhelming majority of the population spoke Kisetogo or Nagakala, languages based on Bantu. However, after 1940 the French language also began to be present in the village. In 1975, with Portugal leaving its African colonies and with the independence of Angola, dozens of Angolans migrated to Kisenge. Thus, in the last decades the Portuguese language has been assimilated by the population and almost half of the population already speaks Portuguese fluently and as a first language. Another factor for the growing number of Portuguese speakers in the village is the large investment in the village by Brazil and Angola and, less by Portugal.  Economy  Economic investments in Kisenge - 2019 Kisenge has one of the main mines in the province of Lualaba, with its production being drained through the Kisenge Branch of the Benguela Railway. The project started in 2013, when a Brazilian company built a complex for the exploration of minerals and metals, employing almost 40% of the entire population.. The village's economy is sustained mainly by clearing the forest and selling wood. In 2007, a company with Angolan and Kenyan capital purchased large portions of land for deforestation, employing a large part of the population. Recent investments by Portugal and France led to the construction of the first health center and a bilingual school (Portuguese and French). In 2011, Chinese investments led to the construction of a large paint factory, although this factory employed about 25% of the population, it polluted the village's lake. In addition, the company started building a school to learn Chinese and a small apartment complex to house Chinese workers. In 2012, the population revolted due to the pollution of the lake and distrust of Chinese immigrants and the attempt to spread Chinese culture, and destroyed the buildings in construction. Currently, the construction of these buildings has been abandoned. The United States and Taiwan have invested in improving the village's infrastructure and telecommunications.  Infrastructure  The village has one of the branches of the Benguela Railway, which serves mainly for the transportation of minerals. The branch links the village of Kisenge with the city of Divuma. The locality has the Kisenge Airport.

New York, 399 U.S. 66 (1970), was a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial for offenses requiring imprisonment of more than six months. Background Robert Baldwin was arrested in New York City for \\"jostling\\". Under the New York City Criminal Court Act, his trial was conducted without a jury, despite his request for a jury trial. Baldwin was convicted and sentenced to one year in prison, following which he appealed the case, arguing that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution granted him the right to a jury trial. Duncan v. Louisiana In 1968, the Warren court incorporated the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and applied it to the states. In Duncan, the defendant had been convicted of battery, which under Louisiana law was punishable by up to two years in prison. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Byron White, noted that in 49 of the 50 states, \\"petty offenses\\" were punishable by no more than one year in jail. Therefore, a crime with a possible two-year sentence was out of step with the common law definition of \\"petty\\" thus necessitating a right to trial by jury.. Decision The majority opinion, authored by Justice Byron White, narrowed the decision of Duncan v. Louisiana by holding that a right to a jury trial is required for all crimes where the penalty exceeds six months imprisonment. The opinion explicitly disagreed with the prosecution's argument that the line should be drawn between misdemeanor and felony, and noted that every other state had reduced punishment for non-jury trials to no more than six months.

He held various diplomatic positions and served as the head of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is known for being at the forefront of the Educational Reform of 1968 and for being the promoter of the Televisi√≥n Educativa de El Salvador (Canal 10), under the presidential term of Fidel S√°nchez Hern√°ndez. In addition, he is the author of two national award- winning dramatic works: El para√≠so de los imprudentes (1955) and Funeral Home (1958).  Formation  Walter B√©neke was born in 1930, in the cradle of an upper-middle-class landlord family. He is the son of Sara Medina de B√©neke, who was president of the \\"Sociedad de Se√±oras de la Caridad\\" (Society of Ladies of Charity), which manages the San Vicente de Paul Homes for the Elderly; his father, on the other hand, was of German origin. He completed his secondary studies at the Jesuit school Externado de San Jos√© in San Salvador. In the early 1950s, he traveled to Spain to study political science and economics at the Central University of Madrid. There he met the future El Salvador president Fidel S√°nchez Hern√°ndez, who was doing his military studies at that time precisely in the city of Madrid. He continued training with courses in journalism and contemporary problems at the Men√©ndez Pelayo International University. During this time, B√©neke dedicated himself to traveling through some European countries, such as France, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, absorbing a great deal of knowledge of European culture.  Literature  In the mid-1950s, Walter B√©neke returned to El Salvador to venture into the existentialist theatre. In 1955, he was the winner of the Floral Games of San Salvador for his work El para√≠so de los imprudentes (1955) and in 1958 he would obtain first place in the theater branch of the IV National Culture Competition for Funeral Home (1958).  Diplomatic and political life  Around 1955, B√©neke was the secretary of the Salvadoran embassy in Germany. In the early 1960s he worked in the Ministry of Economy, and in 1961 was assigned as ambassador to Japan (1961-1966). In Japan, B√©neke was impressed by the way the Japanese government used television for educational purposes. In 1962, he then asked the Nippon H≈çs≈ç Ky≈çkai (Japan Broadcasting Company) to conduct a study on the possibility of implementing instructional television in El Salvador. The results of this study were revealed and showed that it was very favorable to carry out the project and invest in the equipment to achieve it. This rapprochement reinforced the international relationships between Japan and El Salvador. A commission was created in 1963 to carry out this project but failed to take concrete actions. In 1964 an educational television department was created, but it had little budget and priority by the minister of education at that time. In 1966, B√©neke left his position as ambassador and was assigned to head the Educational Television Commission of El Salvador. After several meetings, they agreed to implement the program with students from the third cycle of basic education, taking into account the search for financing for the project.  Minister of Education and Educational Reform of 1968  Upon assuming the presidency in July 1967, Fidel S√°nchez Hern√°ndez places B√©neke in charge of the ministry of education, leading the implementation of the so-called Educational Reform of 1968. The educational reform consisted of reorganizing the administration of the Ministry of Education, diversifying the curricula of secondary education, that is, diversifying the diversified baccalaureates to provide technical tools to students to integrate into the labor market and implement the educational television in the classrooms. Nevertheless, by 1968, this reform had generated an opposition, led by the teachers' union, the National Association of Salvadoran Educators, whose strikes paralyzed the country's educational system.  Other charges  After serving as minister of education, in September 1971, he was reassigned to the position of minister of foreign affairs up to 1972. He was also director of the Central American Technological Institute and the Mortgage Bank of El Salvador; also, he was the secretary of the Embassy of El Salvador in Guatemala and ambassador of El Salvador in Austria.  Murder  B√©neke was assassinated on April 27, 1980, outside his home in San Salvador. The suspect was hidden behind a tree outside his house, and when B√©neke got out of his car he was wounded by a gunshot, then he walked a couple of meters and fell down in front of his house; the attacker escaped in a car that waited for him. It was never clarified the motive for the crime and who had been the perpetrator of his death. B√©neke's funeral took place in the Coraz√≥n de Mar√≠a church in San Salvador.

Gallagher, president of the Duquesne Construction Company from 1931 to 1938, and his family. In May 2020, the House was nominated to be a City of Pittsburgh Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.

Craig, who was Pittsburgh's City Solicitor, owner and editor of the Pittsburgh Gazette, and, in 1943, a one- term Representative in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.Allegheny County Will Book 10: 421. Isabella was in the process of partitioning and selling off her land when her last two living children died accidentally. It was said that the deaths of her sons caused her to lose her sanity and, as such, all sales of her property in the preceding eighteen months were reviewed by the courts to confirm that the purchasers had given her a fair price and not taken advantage of Comingo's mental state. When Isabella died on July 23, 1889, her estate was divided between her living siblings. Her sister, Annie Craig Davison, was granted lots six and seven, which is where the Gallagher- Kieffer House stands today.Preservation Pittsburgh. ‚ÄúGallagher-Kieffer House: Historic Nomination Form.‚Äù Preservation Pittsburgh. Retrieved 18 Jun. 2020. Annie Davison hired the firm of Bennett & Stitely to build the House in 1893, possibly as a home for her newly married daughter, Mary Davison Reed. When 234 North Dithridge Street was constructed, it was numbered 226 North Dithridge Street. The house number was changed to 234 in 1918, possibly to standardize numbering on that block. Neither Annie nor Mary lived in the House, as the 1990 census shows that they were both living at 4614 Fifth Avenue instead. Annie and Mary died in 1906 and 1908, respectively.‚ÄúObituary of Annie Neville Craig Davison.‚Äù The Pittsburgh Press. 23 Aug. 1906. The Reverend Henry T. McClelland and his family were the first tenants of the Gallagher-Kieffer House, living there from 1894 until 1904 during McClelland's tenure as pastor of the Bellefield Presbyterian Church. According to the 1900 census, he and his wife, Lizona, had four children, all of whom were attending school. After the McClelland family moved to Washington, PA, the next tenants of the House were the Larkin family, who lived there from 1906 to 1911. The head of the household, Robert Larkin, was a native of Pennsylvania, worked as a clerk, and occupied the House with his four sisters. After the Larkin family moved from the Gallagher-Kieffer House, there are no known records of the tenants who may have lived in the home before it was purchased by the Gallagher family in 1914.  Gallagher-Kieffer Ownership  The long-term residents of 234 North Dithridge Street have been members of the Gallagher family. Patrick F. Gallagher and Katharine Kieffer, both natives to Pennsylvania, married in 1901 and soon after moved to Pittsburgh.Marriage License Announcement. The Philadelphia Inquirer. 13 Oct. 1901.

Here, they had four more children (one of whom, Philip, died seven months after being born). The 1930 census recorded eight of the ten children living at the Gallagher-Kieffer House, with two (Kathleen and Dorothy) working as schoolteachers and the rest attending school. P.F. Gallagher‚Äôs rise to prominence in the Duquesne Construction Company‚Äîeventually becoming the company‚Äôs president in 1931‚Äîis reflected in the Gallagher-Kieffer House. This is most evident in the plaster bas-relief sculpture of St. Benedict located over the dining room fireplace mantel, which served as the plaster cast for a bronze bas-relief of St. Benedict in St. Boniface Roman Catholic Church on Pittsburgh‚Äôs North Side, which the Duquesne Construction Company built. Patrick F.

Descendants of the Gallagher-Kieffer family currently live in the House.  Architecture  The Gallagher-Kieffer House exemplifies the late-nineteenth century Victorian period Shingle Style of architecture. Its steeply pitched gambrel roof, shingled second floors walls without corner boards, integral porch, and the absence of highly decorative detailing all are characteristic elements of the Shingle style. The House is unique within its Pittsburgh neighborhood, North Oakland, for this architectural style, as many other residential buildings in the area favor Richardsonian Romanesque architecture. The House also features numerous stained glass windows and panes.  Gallery  File:Gallagher-Kieffer House2.pngalt=A picture of a 1904 plat map showing the Gallagher-Kieffer House.

He was a poet and playwright, and he contributed to several newspapers. In 1856 he became a member of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri. He was ordained a priest in 1860 and became rector of the seminary in Cadiz. He was vicar general of the Diocese of Cadiz from 1866 to 1868 and canon archpriest of the cathedral. On 17 September 1875, Pope Pius IX appointed him Bishop of Cuenca. He was consecrated bishop on 30 November by Jos√© F√©lix Arriete Llano, Bishop of Cadiz. On 18 December 1876 he was transferred to the Diocese of Vitoria. In 1880, because of health problems, he gave up his bishopric and retired to Sanl√∫car de Barrameda. On 27 March 1882, Pope Leo XIII named him Bishop of Oviedo and then transferred him Cordoba on 15 March 1883. On 24 March 1898, Pope Leo promoted him to Archbishop of Valencia. Pope Leo XIII made him cardinal-priest of Santi Bonifacio ed Alessio in the consistory of 22 June 1903 and died before Herrero could be invested with the symbols of that office. Herrero, very ill himself, nevertheless participated in the conclave of 1903 that elected Pope Pius X and received his red hat from Pope Pius. He died in Valencia on 9 December 1903.

The small brick building was built c. 1822. Its original use was as a single-room real estate office, although it was later expanded. At the time of construction, Lucas Sullivant was selling and giving away pieces of land, and Franklinton became the county seat of Franklin County. The building is the only remaining structure associated with Lucas Sullivant in the Franklinton area. In the early 1980s, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department moved the building from its original location at 714 W. Gay St. to 13 N Gift St., behind the William Henry Harrison house. The move was prompted because the building was endangered in its original location, with vandalism, deterioration, and plans to create a parking lot for a car dealership on the site.

The first Free Trade Unions of hospitality workers in Germany were established in 1889 and 1890 in Altona, Berlin, Hamburg, Kiel, Leipzig and Magedeburg, and in October 1890, the Berlin Union of Restaurant Workers launched a national journal, Der Gastwirtsgehilfe. In 1894, the various local unions organised a congress in Berlin, which established a national agitation committee. In October 1897, the unions finally agreed to merge to form the \\"Union of German Restaurant Workers\\", which was officially established on 1 January 1898. It affiliated to the General Commission of German Trade Unions. It initially had only 915 members, but grew rapidly. The union soon became the strongest in the industry anywhere in Europe, and it established branches outside the country, in cities to which German workers had migrated. This effort led it to call an international congress in 1908, which formed the International Union of Hotel, Restaurant and Bar Workers, the union providing its headquarters. In 1919, the union was a founding affiliate of the General German Trade Union Federation, and by 1920, it had 63,243 members. That year, it merged with the Union of Hotel, Restaurant and Cafe Employees and the Union of Chefs, to form the Central Union of Hotel, Restaurant and Cafe Employees.

Several respiratory diseases cause the normal mucociliary clearance mechanism to become impaired resulting in a build-up of mucus which obstructs breathing, and also affects the cough reflex. Mucus build-up can also cause infection, and inflammation, and repeated infections can result in damage to the airways, and the lung tissue. All airway clearance therapy involves the techniques of coughing, or huffing that need to be used in conjunction with another airway clearance technique. Respiratory therapists make recommendations and give guidance for appropriate airway clearance therapies. They also give instruction in the use of various airway clearance techniques. Clearance techniques Airway clearance therapy uses different airway clearance techniques (ACTs) in a number of respiratory disorders including, cystic fibrosis, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to maintain respiratory health, and prevent the damaging consequences of inflammation. Techniques used are breathing, manual, and mechanical. They all need to be used with either coughing or huffing which moves mucus from the large airways. To move mucus from the small airways an additional ACT needs to be employed. Breathing Breathing techniques include the active cycle of breathing which includes huffing; and autogenic drainage, a technique that requires concentrated effort. =Huffing= Huffing or a huff cough, is also called forced expiration technique, and helps to move mucus away from the lung wall so that it can finally be coughed out. Huffing needs to be carried out in a sitting position with the chin raised a little, and the mouth remaining open. A deep breath is taken to fill the lungs about 75 per cent, and held for two or three seconds. Breathing out is forceful and slow which helps to move the mucus from the smaller to the larger airways. A normal urge to cough at this point is repressed, and the breathing pattern is repeated a few times. A strong cough then follows to expel the mucus. Huffing forms part of the active cycle of breathing. =Active cycle of breathing= The active cycle of breathing technique is carried out in three phases. Phase one is used to relax the airways; phase two involves moving the inhaled air to behind the mucus in order to clear it; phase three helps to clear the mucus out from the lungs. ;Phase one Gentle effortless breathing, in through the nose, and out through the mouth is used in phase one to relax the airways. The shoulders and upper chest are kept relaxed. On breathing out, the pursed lips method is advised. Keeping the lips pursed (as in kissing somebody) when exhaling creates a back pressure that keeps the airways open for longer. One recommendation is for six breaths of control to take place before phase two of the cycle. ;Phase two Phase two involves using exercises to expand the chest. Breathing is deep and may use a breath-hold of three seconds to move the air into the smaller airways, and reach behind the mucus. The out breath is unforced and may include some percussive clapping, or vibration. ;Phase three Using huffing coughing, mucus is moved from the smaller airways to the larger airways, and huffing needs to be continued until all the mucus is expelled. =Autogenic drainage= Autogenic drainage is a very controlled airway clearance technique using different depths of inhalation, and different speeds of exhalation that enables mucus to be moved up the airway producing a voluntary cough. This method needs training, attention, and effort. Manual Chest physiotherapy is a manual airway clearance therapy that uses chest percussion, (clapping, and vibration), and postural drainage. However, they are labour- intensive, and time-consuming, and mechanical devices are often used instead. Mechanical An intrapulmonary percussive ventilator machine Mechanical devices used include positive expiratory pressure (PEP), intrapulmonary percussive ventilators, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation known as a mechanically assisted cough, and airway oscillatory devices. Several mechanical techniques are used to dislodge mucus and encourage its expectoration. Chest percussion can be administered as a manual technique but can also be performed using specific devices that use chest wall oscillation or intrapulmonary percussive ventilation. Intrapulmonary percussive ventilators (IPVs) are machines which deliver short bursts of air through a mouthpiece to help to clear mucus. The air is delivered at a rate of approximately 150 pulses per minute and may be used with nebulized medication. Chest wall oscillation is a passive system that is not dependent on effort from the user. It involves the use of a special vest that employs the use of a compressor to inflate and deflate the vest rhythmically at timed intervals, and thus imposes high frequency chest wall oscillations that are transferred to the lungs. These oscillations thin airway mucus, and facilitate its removal by coughing. Delivery of air to the vest can be controlled manually. Other methods such as biphasic cuirass ventilation, and associated clearance mode available in such devices, integrate a cough assistance phase, as well as a vibration phase for dislodging secretions. These are portable and adapted for home use. Positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy consists of providing a back pressure to the airways during expiration. This effect is provided by devices that consist of a mask or a mouthpiece in which a resistance is applied only on the expiration phase. Operating principles of this technique seems to be the increase of gas pressure behind mucus through collateral ventilation along with a temporary increase in functional residual capacity preventing the early collapse of small airways during exhalation.

It is Roud Folk Song Index number 9621. The consensus is that it originated in the late 19th century English music hall tradition. It was sung by British soldiers during World War I, and also by RAF airmen during World War II. It has crossed the Atlantic to North America. It has also become a British rugby song. A wealthy older man seduces a young and pretty country girl. Out of shame, she flees to London, becomes a prostitute, and eventually drowns herself in the river; whereas he remains an accepted member of high society. The details vary, and the words have varying degrees of bawdiness. The man may be a rich man, a squire, a Member of Parliament, or an army officer. He may or may not get her pregnant. She may be a common or a high- class prostitute; but in Billy Bennett's recorded version, she sells bootlaces on the street instead; and in Derek Lamb's, matches. The refrain points the moral: The song has been recorded but few times, perhaps because of its subject-matter. In 1930, English comedian Billy Bennett made a 10\\" single, Columbia DB 164, with the words credited to Bert Lee and R. P. Weston and the music to Lee. In 1962, Derek Lamb, best known as a British animation filmmaker and producer, included it on an album itself called She Was Poor but She Was Honest. It has also appeared in recorded compilations of rugby songs. The Whole World Over is also the English title of a 1947 play by Konstantin Simonov, and of a 2007 novel by Julia Glass. This song is completely different from \\"The Same the Whole World Over\\" by Irish singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan on his 2018 album Gilbert O'Sullivan.

Plot Protagonist Tamar Rabinyan, a young Jewish woman born in Iran but raised in Israel, is a Mossad agent and computer hacker, sent on a mission to the Iranian capital, assigned to disabling an Iranian nuclear reactor. Her specific job is to neutralize Iran's air defenses, so that Israeli warplanes can bomb a nuclear plant and prevent Iran from obtaining an atomic bomb.

In Zhila's place she enters the electric company station and connects to the computer network. Then she tries to cut electric power to the Iranian radar system, in order to facilitate an ongoing Israeli Air Force attack. Her mission fails because her boss, who thinks she is Zhila, tries to rape her and is killed as a result of their fight. She escapes and goes into hiding. Tamar was born in Iran and moved to Israel when she was six, and she now discovers her local roots, goes to see her aunt, and befriends Iranian pro-democracy activists.

Maria Clementina Vilas Boas Carneiro de Moura was born in Lisbon, Portugal on 25 September 1898, the daughter of Jo√£o Lopes Carneiro de Moura and Elvira Vilas Boas. She completed a painting course at the Lisbon School of Fine Arts in 1920, where she was a student of the Portuguese realist painter Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro and colleague of the modernist painter Sarah Affonso. That same year she visited Paris, where she first met the Portuguese painter and cartoonist Abel Manta, who she would marry in 1927. Their son, Jo√£o Abel Manta, would become particularly famous as a cartoonist during the dying days of the authoritarian Estado Novo regime. Carneiro de Moura spent a large part of her life as a secondary-school teacher, while also practicing her art and, from 1920, taking part in numerous exhibitions, particularly those of the SNBA, the Sociedade Nacional de Belas Artes (National Society of Fine Arts). In 1940 she worked on the decoration of the Orient Pavilion at the Portuguese World Exhibition (Exposi√ß√£o do Mundo Portugu√™s), held in Bel√©m on the River Tagus near Lisbon. This was staged to commemorate the foundation of the nation in 1140 and the regaining of its independence from Spain in 1640 but was also an opportunity to promote the ideology of the Estado Novo. At the same time, the SNBA exhibitions brought together avant-garde painters, where the neorealist tendency condemned by the Salazarist Estado Novo dominated. Self-portrait of the artist with her son In 1947 she travelled throughout the country, investigating Portuguese decorative arts, namely the production of quilts, embroidery and traditional lace. Several publications resulted from this research. She became a world export on embroidery, particularly for quilts or bedspreads, and also travelled outside Portugal to research the topic. Her interest in Portuguese crafts was part of a movement among artists in Europe and elsewhere to preserve and renew traditional techniques, promoted by artists such as Sonia Delaunay and Sophie Taeuber-Arp. Although some of her research was published by the Estado Novo's Mocidade Portuguesa Feminina (MPF - Female Youth Movement), she and her family remained constant opponents of the dictatorship. She belonged to the Portuguese Women's Peace Association (AFPP) in the 1940s and 1950s and to the Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas (CNMP - National Council of Portuguese Women), which was closed down by the Estado Novo in 1947. Before its closure the CNMP, under the guidance of Maria Lamas, organised an exhibition of three thousand books by 1400 women authors from thirty countries, which filled the Great Hall of Fine Arts at the University of Lisbon. Together with two others, Carneiro de Moura made portraits of more than one hundred famous women, which covered the walls of the SNBA hall. She was the first woman to hold a management position at the SNBA, from 1950 to 1954. With her husband, Abel Manta After the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1975 she joined the MDM, the Movimento Democr√°tico de Mulheres (Women‚Äôs Democratic Movement), and regularly participated in the life of the Movement, helping to organize exhibitions at the MDM's headquarters, including her only solo painting exhibition in 1989. Clementina Carneiro de Moura died on July 18, 1992, in Lisbon. Her work is represented in public and private collections, including the Centro de Arte Moderna of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon. In 2013 the Cascais Cultural Centre held an exhibition of her work together with that of her husband, son (Jo√£o Abel Manta) and granddaughter (Isabel Manta).

Born in Colditz, Poetzsch found work in hotels in France, Belgium, English, Switzerland and Italy. In 1891, he moved to Berlin and joined the recently-formed union of hospitality workers in the city. Before the end of the year, he was elected as editor of the union's newspaper, Der Gastwirtsgehilfe. This was distributed across the country, and so when in 1893 a national agitation committee for the industry was formed, Poetzsch played a leading role. He saw his primary role as informing workers in the industry about their relationship with business owners and recruitment agencies. He also campaigned against the reliance of hospitality staff on tips. In 1898, the local unions of hospitality workers formed the Union of German Restaurant Workers, and Poetzsch was elected as its president. The union grew rapidly under his leadership, and also established the International Union of Hotel, Restaurant and Bar Workers (IUHR). In 1912, Poetzsch resigned as leader of the union to become editor of the Social Democratic Party of Germany's journal, Sozialdemokratischen Partei-Korrespondenz. He maintained his links with the hospitality workers, serving as general secretary of the IUHR until World War I, and as director of Der Gastwirtsgehilfe until 1919. In 1919, Poetzsch became a magistrate in Berlin, and resigned all his paid union posts, while remaining a member of the Restaurant Workers.

Sanders for the American National Election Studies in the 1980s. It has been considered the dominant measure of symbolic racism since its inception. History The racial resentment scale was developed in the 1980s by Donald Kinder and Lynn M. Sanders, who developed it on behalf of the American National Election Study. In 2020, a review listed it as the dominant measure of symbolic racism in the decades since its creation. It has also been called the most commonly utilized measure of racial resentment. The scale has three pillars: anti-black affect, belief in the idea that African Americans have not conformed to the Protestant work ethic, and denial of ongoing discrimination against African Americans. Purpose and structure Kinder and Sanders defined racial resentment as \\"the conjunction of whites' feelings towards blacks and their support for American values, especially secularized versions of the Protestant ethic\\". They referred to racial resentment as \\"new racism\\", stating that it was less a belief in the innate inferiority of African Americans, but rather, the notion that they do not live up to American values like Protestant morality and a hard work ethic. Thus, the racial resentment scale's stated purpose was to identify White Americans who were \\"generally sympathetic\\" to Black Americans, or conversely, unsympathetic. The standard racial resentment scale is a list of four statements, with respondents indicating how strongly they agree or disagree with each one: # Irish, Italian, Jewish, and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. # Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class. # Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve. # It's really a matter of some people just not trying hard enough: if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites. In the expanded version, a further two statements are included: # Government officials usually pay less attention to a request or complaint from a black person than from a white person # Most blacks who receive money from welfare programs could get along without it if they tried Results and effectiveness In the US, surveys have found that typically, Republicans score higher on the scale than Democrats. Additionally, in the 2016 United States presidential election, supporters of then-candidate Donald Trump had higher racial resentment scores than supporters of other Republican candidates. The racial resentment scale has been criticized for not separating racism from ideas like conservatism or individualism. Some political scientists have attributed Republicans' higher resentment scores to the fact that they typically favor less government intervention; they are more averse to government assistance to the poor, regardless of race. Believers in the Just-world hypothesis, who therefore believe that one's fate is morally fair and a direct result of one's own actions, also score higher on the racial resentment scale. Several studies have found that racial resentment scores are lower among younger Americans. The wording of the statements has been criticized for being vague or otherwise imprecise. For example, in the statement, \\"Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve,\\" it is not stated what Black Americans have gotten less of, or relative to whom.

She is the Ronda Stryker and William Johnston Professor of Global Health in the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Early life and education Murray was born to a New Zealand- born scientist father and grew up in Minnesota with three siblings, including Christopher J. L. Murray. As her father was an internist and her mother was a microbiologist, the family moved to Niger for various charitable medical missions. After earning her undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College in 1980, Murray traveled to Thailand with the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration to conduct Tuberculosis (TB) screenings. She later earned her medical degree from Harvard Medical School and her Master's and Doctor of Public Health (DPH) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Murray simultaneously completed her residency at Massachusetts General Hospital while specialising in infectious diseases. Career Following her DPH, Murray joined the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health as an Assistant professor. During the 2002‚Äì2004 SARS outbreak, she worked with Postdoctoral fellow Ted Cohen to develop a mathematical model that proved that a number of multidrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis can easily reproduce and spread. She also worked with Marc Lipsitch to create a mathematical model to estimate the speed of SARS in China and how to effectively lower its transmission. The following year, she sat on the Medical Advisory Committee on Avian Flu to \\"advise top University officials in real time about the medical aspects of the flu.\\" In 2007, Murray co-published Transmission Dynamics and Control of Severe Acute Repiratory Syndrome in the peer-reviewed academic journal Science. They used data collected in Singapore to calculate how long it takes for the disease to spread from one individual to another. Later, while working as a co-principal investigator in an international collaboration project using Whole genome sequencing, she concluded that Mycobacterium tuberculosis was directly linked to more than 50 deaths during a tuberculosis outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The following year, Murray was appointed the Principal Investigator of a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis study to better understand the development and transmission of drug resistant tuberculosis. She also worked with Sarah Fortune to identify how tuberculosis develops drug-resistance mutations. In 2013, Murray and Maha Farhat led a group of researchers in adapting Phylogenetics to discover the drug-resistance genes in humans. Their research resulted in the discovery of 39 new genes associated with elevated drug resistance. Two years later, Murray published a study she led in Peru on how transmissible multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was. Her research team received a grant from the National Institutes of Health and began gathering data in Peru by 2009. The group studied 25 districts in Lima and gathered information about which genetic strains are likely to be drug-resistant. The aim of the study was to use the collected data to improve diagnosis of drug-resistance in patients and discover risk factors. During the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, Murray co-published a research paper with Ann Miller titled ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test kit for point-of-care and laboratory-based testing for Ebola virus disease: a field validation study in The Lancet. The aim of the study was to develop a more accurate test for diagnosing Ebola by using a finger stick to draw sample blood and apply it to a treated strip. The test took about 15 minutes to diagnose instead of numerous days. Since 2015, she has sat on the editorial board for PLOS Medicine and later the European Journal of Epidemiology. As a result of her research, Murray was appointed the inaugural Ronda Stryker and William Johnston Professor of Global Health at Harvard Medical School in May 2017. She was also named the director of research at the Brigham and Women's Division of Global Health Equity and at Partners In Health. In this role, she led the first large-scale study on how the tuberculosis bacterium affects different individuals based on their genes. They concluded that \\"some of the risk for early disease progression is driven by several gene variants, at least one of which controls key immune functions.\\" During the coronavirus pandemic, Murray approached the Abundance Foundation with the theory that the BCG vaccine could protect people against the virus.

It is located in the southern part of Lake Tollensesee, in front of the city of Penzlin. It is a 150-meter-long and 40-meter-wide island, which is today covered with trees. In the middle of the island, at its eastern end, stands a ruined fishing hut from 1729, which was still used in the 1970s. Fishermen who stayed in the Tollensesee lakes and nearby Lieps spent the night there.  Archeology  For a long time research was carried out on the island, because it was believed that it was the legendary center of the cult of Slavic tribe Veleti ‚Äì Rethra. In 1969, during archaeological excavations carried out under the direction of the German archaeologist Adolf Hollnagel, two cult figures of oak wood were discovered in the layer dated to the 11th-12th century. The first, 1.78 meter high, shows two male busts with large eyes, noses and mustaches in headgear (helmets?) placed on a column. The second figure, measuring 1.57 meter, shows a female figure with clearly marked breasts. According to the researchers, this finding can confirm the existence of the cult of twin deities in the Slavic mythology (see Lel and Polel). There were also many remains of wood from a castle (castrum Wustrow), also mentioned in a document, which existed until the 13th century. A bridge discovered in 1886 when a canal was built led from the mainland near Wustrow to the island. During subsequent excavations, valuable finds were made, such as keys, knives, axes, spear points, temple rings, silver coins and others. It is believed that the island was fortified settlement. In 1977, another German archaeologist Hartmut Boeck discovered a 40m √ó 14m rectangular place in the northeastern part of the island, which was growing more and more every year. However, he came to the conclusion that there had to be a building here once. Earlier drilling in the same place, which was carried out by Gustav Oesten in 1905, proved that there were pieces of charcoal and ceramic shells in this place. A building or castle once located in the northeastern part of the island indicates a settlement of Slavic worship. It is believed that Fischerinsel is the most likely place of the Rethra.

Nikita leverages technologies at the intersection of (bio-)electromagnetics, sensors, and materials to yield next-generation wearables and implants characterized by extreme miniaturization and enhanced performance. She integrates data acquired from health monitoring systems with multiscale, multilevel modeling and intelligent decision-making techniques to diagnose, study and treat a variety of diseases including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, as well as neurological, mental and cognitive disorders. Her work refers to both fundamental problems, which require the use of sophisticated methods of theoretical analysis and synthesis, and to the design and construction of experimental prototypes and intelligent health monitoring systems based on theoretical results of her work. She is credited with pioneering the modelling of complex human diseases, such as diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, by developing personalized multiscale models providing enhanced understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, facilitating self-disease management and assisting therapeutic interventions. She employed machine learning techniques exploiting medical, lifestyle, environmental, and genetic data and integrated them with existing pathophysiological knowledge and models in order to devise personalized markers for the early detection and assessment of an array of highly prevalent diseases. By multiscale modeling of carotid atherosclerosis, Nikita and her team introduced novel low-cost biomarkers for CVD/stroke risk assessment, bridging the gap between multifaceted phenotypes, incorporating image analysis-based indices, and pathophysiological mechanisms, underlying plaque vulnerability and rupture. Nikita and her team developed smart systems, which incorporate sensing, computing and communication technologies, software/hardware modeling and system architectures for the monitoring, treatment, motivation and coaching of patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions. Her early research has significantly advanced mobile phone technology and has markedly improved hyperthermia technology and treatment efficacy, including pioneering intra-operative treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Description Star Explorer is a board game of space exploration for one to four players designed by Douglas Bonforte and Leonard H. Kanterman, with artwork by Bob Charrette and Jeff Dee. Although not licensed by Paramount Pictures, the game is modelled after themes and tropes found in the Star Trek television series. The game components are: * 16‚Äù x 20‚Äù game board * sheet of paper counters that represent crew teams, ships, hazards, and planets. * ship logsheet, command logsheet, and planetary logsheet (to be photocopied) * 20-page rulebook * two six-sided dice, a ten- sided die, and a twenty-sided die Gameplay Each player commands a Space Fleet Service cruiser, and tries to complete various missions in order to earn victory points. Setup Each player receives a randomly allocated planet and a random mission to begin, and then uses a pool of points to design their starship and allocate crew. Turns The person with the least number of victory points goes first, and can either move, do planetary actions, or engage in combat with hostile aliens. Planetary actions When a ship arrives at a new planet, the type of planet is randomly determined. The player determines what types of crew teams should be sent. Several random encounters are determined, as well as team encounters. Engineers or military can also be sent down to prospect for fuel. Each encounter is resolved by die rolls, with modifiers for the types of team that are present, and more die rolls determine victory points earned (from 3-21), as well as number of teams lost. If the player withdraws from an encounter, the player is penalized the number of victory points that the encounter was worth. Victory conditions The person with the most victory points after twenty turns is the winner. Reception In the May 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #41), Alan E. Paull found the game to be \\"well-constructed and immensely playable,\\" although he did say that \\"Star Explorer is not a game for those who dislike dice, because all these encounters are resolved by consulting tables and rolling dice.\\" Although Paull found \\"the rather unimaginative artwork [...] does detract slightly from the quality of the product,\\" he thought the game was \\"very well balanced\\", pointing out that \\"It is not possible to win just by selecting one or two particular encounter types and betting everything on them.\\" He concluded by giving the game an excellent rating of 9 out of 10, saying, \\"Above all, the game plays smoothly and swiftly and rarely gets bogged down in inactivity.\\" In a retrospective review for Black Gate, John O'Neill recalled that Star Explorer disappeared from the marketplace quickly, \\"which is a shame, because it had a lot of potential.\\" He called the rulebook \\"a miracle of concise design, punching in at a slim 16 pages.\\" Other recognition A copy of Star Explorer is held in the collection of the Strong National Museum of Play (Object ID 117.788).

Scott is a former United States Air Force officer. Scott was among the first 10 women pilots in the US Air Force. First 10 Air Force female pilots. Scott is 6th from left in the white turtle neck.  Biography  Scott entered Oregon State University in 1969. In 1970, she joined the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, (ROTC). After commissioning she trained at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida as a weapons controller. She then served in Tactical Air Command (TAC) at Bergstrom AFB, Texas. Her next assignment was King Salmon Long Range Radar Station, AK. While in Alaska, she was selected for undergraduate pilot training (UPT) as part of the test program to train women jet pilots, UPT Class 77-08. The ten women's initial pilot training was in T-41 airplanes at Hondo Air Base, San Antonio, Texas and Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. They attended 49 weeks of training including 278 classroom hours, 125 physical training hours, and 210 flying hours. Upon graduation, the women pilots were limited to flying the KC-135 (a military version of the Boeing 707), C-130, C-141 and C-9 cargo/transport aircraft or the T37 and T38 trainer aircraft. Scott's first flight assignment was to Mather Air Force Base, California piloting a KC-135 Stratotanker, flying air-to-air refueling, and performing alert duty as part of Strategic Air Command (SAC). Her follow on assignment in 1982 was to the US Air Force Academy (USAFA) where she was sailplane instructor and flew the UV-18 (De Havilland Twin Otter) for the USAFA parachute training program. During that time she also competed as a member of the Air Force Shooting team. In 1986 Scott transferred to the Air National Guard to fly the C-22 (a military version of the Boeing 727) and the C-21(a military version of Learjet 35) as part of the District of Columbia Air National Guard supporting Military Airlift Command (MAC).

She is the author of the Prophecy trilogy, also known as the Dragon King Chronicles, a series of fantasy, young adult novels based on Korean folklore. Life and career Oh grew up in Brooklyn, New York. She attended New York University and Georgetown University, graduating with a legal degree. She began to write seriously after she had children, prompted by her struggle to find books that included representations for her kids. Prophecy, the first book in Oh's young adult fantasy series, was published in January 2013. The series, known both as the Prophecy trilogy and the Dragon King Chronicles, draws from Korean folklore. In 2014, BookCon announced an all-white line-up for the event and hosted a children's book author panel consisting of all-white, all-male participants. In response, Elleh Oh and others in the industry created a Twitter campaign under the hashtag #WeNeedDiverseBooks. The campaign, launched on May 1, 2014, gained 106 million twitter impressions in the first 24 hours. The organization We Need Diverse Books (WNDB) was incorporated in the summer of 2014. For her work, Oh was named one of Publishers Weekly's Notable People in 2014. As of 2020, she is currently the president of WNDB. In 2016, Oh was a judge for the National Book Awards in the young people‚Äôs literature category. Oh's book, Spirit Hunters, was started after her daughter was hospitalized due to depression. The first scene she wrote for the book was influenced by the hospital room and, according to Oh, based on \\"that feeling of depression and horror and sadness and fear that I was feeling and that I know my kid was feeling.\\" The book follows a young child, Harper, and her family as they move into a seemingly haunted house. The story was influenced by Korean Shamanism, and was published in 2017. In 2020, Oh, Christina Soontornvat and Melanie Conklin created the Everywhere Book Fest, due to COVID-19 cancelling in-person book festivals. It was held online from May 1 to 2, focusing on children's literature with 43,000 viewers attending.

Sears Pico site=Sears Pico (1939) Sears-Pico was a Sears branch that opened here on October 19, 1939. The designer was John Raben, who assisted Jock Peters in the design of Bullocks Wilshire. It was of retail space over two floors plus a basement, the largest Sears store on the West Coast at the time. Pico and Rimpau was not a major shopping district, but Sears had been having success since 1925 doing things differently from other retail chains, which placed their stores in downtown shopping districts, by instead opening freestanding stores in working-to-middle-class suburban areas of major U.S. cities, designed for access primarily by car, although in the case of the Pico store, there was easy access by transit. Sears-Pico claimed one of the largest street display windows in the city at the time, at 18 by 40 feet. It had parking for 360 cars, including an rooftop parking deck, from which customers parking there would descend via escalator into the store. From the roof parking lot, the store entrance was not utilitarian but in the style of a main entrance. All of this was novel and futuristic at the time. The Los Angeles Times noted that at the time, \\"people would come from miles around to see the rooftop parking deck\\". Other features considered progressive at the time were streamlined escalators, \\"windowless construction\\" (no windows to the outside from the selling floor), and air conditioning. Moreover, the floor plan was open instead of divided into sections, and the entire syncretic architectural design of the store was based around the needs of the selling floor. Sears boasted that \\"a rival merchandising executive offered tribute: 'in my long experience in the retail field, I have yet to witness a unit which equals Sears' Pico store in practical efficiency, merchandise engineering, operation, layout and presentation of merchandise'\\".\\"Sears History - 1940s to 1970s\\", Sears Archives Mayor Tom Bradley once remarked that he enjoyed shopping at Sears-Pico asked a Sears executive, \\"‚ÄúYou guys aren‚Äôt gonna going to close down Pico, now, are you?\\". By the 1990s, the Pico/Rimpau area was surrounded by mostly working-class residents: Central American and Korean immigrants, and African Americans. The lack of middle-class shoppers who patronized the Miracle Mile shopping district (earlier on), and nearby malls such as Crenshaw Center (1947), Fox Hills Mall (1975), and Beverly Center (1982), led to decades of declining sales. The area suffered damage from the 1965 Watts riots and further with the 1992 Rodney King riots. In 1988, Sears built a store in the newly renovated and expanded Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, formerly Crenshaw Center. By the mid-1990s, Sears had sold the store. The first floor was occupied by a discount hardware store and the second by a bazaar of independent vendors, in California known as an indoor swap meet. The building was demolished around 2003 and Midtown Crossing was built on the site. Midtown Crossing today Midtown Crossing has of retail space on and opened in 2012 on the former Sears/Builder's Emporium site and part of the Rimpau Loop site. Lowe's, Smart & Final Extra!, Petsmart and Ross Dress for Less are the main big-box anchors. The center was the result of a 2010 plan in which the city provided $34 million worth of loans and subsidies for its construction. Midtown Shopping Center Midtown Shopping Center was a neighborhood shopping center adjacent to the large Sears store to its east. It opened in 1960 with of retail space, originally anchored by Thrifty Drug Stores, J. J. Newberry five and dime, and a Safeway supermarket. Much of it was destroyed in the 1992 riots. A Zodys discount store opened in 1980. Today it is a power center anchored by Ralphs supermarket, CVS Pharmacy, Living Space and Planet Fitness. Streetcar and bus hubs The Rimpau Loop, opened in 1935, was a bus-to-streetcar transfer station and terminal of the Los Angeles Railway (\\"Yellow Cars\\") \\"P\\" Pico Blvd. streetcar line, which terminated and turned around here.\\"LARY: Rimpau Look / PE: Vineyard Junction, 1938\\", PERYHS site From here, Santa Monica city buses ran to Downtown Santa Monica, and to this day, Pico and Rimpau is the terminus for several Santa Monica Transit lines. Vineyard Junction: Pacific Electric \\"Red Car\\" lines converged here. The lines ran from Downtown Los Angeles south to Venice Boulevard, then West along Venice to Vineyard Junction. From here they went along Venice Blvd. to Venice and Redondo Beach; while others went along San Vicente Blvd. northwest toward what is now West Hollywood as well as via Beverly Hills to Santa Monica. It was the site of an accident on July 13, 1913, in which two wooden streetcars crashed into each other, with 14 people dead and 200 people injured. As a result, the Pacific Electric ordered its future cars to be made of steel, and it was recommended that signaling be introduced on the PE's lines.

Biography Born into the family of a graduate student - the future scientist of automation systems Viktor Obuhov. The mother of Herman Obuhov - Dina Obuhov, a native of Privalov, was an engineer. In 1955, the family moved to Grozny, North Caucasus, where Herman‚Äôs father got a job at the Grozny Oil Institute, but they left there in 1959 and moved to Minsk, where Viktor Obuhov found a more attractive job at the Academy of Sciences of the Belorussian SSR.

He later transferred to the Leningrad Electrotechnical University (LETI) from where he successfully graduated in 1975. In 1982, Herman married Irina Akulova, the wedding took place in the \\"political zone\\" in the Northern Urals. In 1988, Herman Obuhov emigrated to the West, first to Great Britain at the invitation of Amnesty International, and then to the United States, where the U.S. Congress granted him political asylum in absentia Social and political activities in the Soviet period After graduating from the LETI University in 1975, Herman Obuhov began working as an engineer in the GSKT Bureau, one of the many electronic design bureaus of Leningrad, but the work of an engineer was not attractive to him and he took the initiative in to participate in public life. First, he was elected as a komsomol leader of the department, then the Deputy Secretary of the Komsomol committee of the GSKT Bureau for international affairs. He begins meetings with foreign delegations and party bosses. He was invited to work as a secretary in the Komsomol district committee with a mandatory entry into the CPSU, but he avoided this proposal and begins to understand the deceit of the Soviet system. After his car accident and canceled tourist trip to Finland- Sweden, he left the GSKT Bureau in 1977 and went to work at the Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Medicine, AMS USSR, headed by Natalia Bekhtereva, with a fairly liberal attitude to labor discipline and political views. From this moment in the life of Herman there is a cardinal change in relation to the Soviet regime and the CPSU. He begins frequent contacts with American students and western tourists. In 1978, he began writing the anticommunist book, The Extinguished Dawn. A year after studying all of world philosophy, when part of the manuscript was ready, he goes to the International Book Fair in Moscow in1979, where he meets the French publisher from Gallimard Annie Chevallier and the American publisher from Daubleday Publish House Alexander Hoffman. In 1980, his contacts with representatives of the Western world expanded and multiplied. He met Craig Whitney, the correspondent of New York Times and Anthony Barbiery, the correspondent of the Baltimore Sun. This does not go unnoticed by the KGB and he is constantly under surveillance. Arrest and ‚Äúpolitical zones‚Äù In 1981, during a trip from Leningrad to Moscow with the intention of handing over the unfinished manuscript ‚ÄúThe Extinguished Dawn‚Äù to his acquaintances, publishers at the International Book Fair in Moscow, he was arrested and returned to Leningrad to the KGB pre-trial detention center. After 3 months of investigation, the Leningrad City Court sentenced him to 4 years of labor camps and 2 years of exile on charges of ‚Äúanti-Soviet agitation and propaganda,‚Äù art. 70 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR. Herman served his term in the labor camp (\\"political zone\\") of VS 389/37 in the village Polovinka, Chusovskoy area, Perm district. After the full term, Herman Obuhov was exiled to the backyards of the Soviet empire - to the village Ayan, Khabarovsk district on the shore of the Sea of Okhotsk. After completing his term, Herman was not allowed to live in Leningrad and was forced to emigrate abroad, which he did and flew into London. .–°–∞–º–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞. 1950-–µ ‚Äî 1980-–µ. –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è / –ü–æ–¥ –æ–±—â–µ–π —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏–µ–π –î.–°–µ–≤–µ—Ä—é—Ö–∏–Ω–∞. ‚Äî –ú.: –ù–æ–≤–æ–µ –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±–æ–∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ, 2003. ‚Äî –°. 294 Social and political activities in the post-Soviet period As soon as Herman Obuhov settled in the United States and began working in 1990 as a biomedical engineer at Yale-New Haven Hospital, he returned to his political activity–°–∞–º–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞. 1950-–µ ‚Äî 1980-–µ. –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è / –ü–æ–¥ –æ–±—â–µ–π —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏–µ–π –î.–°–µ–≤–µ—Ä—é—Ö–∏–Ω–∞. ‚Äî –ú.: –ù–æ–≤–æ–µ –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±–æ–∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ, 2003. ‚Äî –°. 294.. The Soviet Union collapsed and many politicians in the United States were interested in the opinions of former Soviet political prisoners regarding the new Russia.. Herman establishes the Russian-American Council for Economic Development (RACED) with the participation of the First Mayor of St. Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, and flies to St. Petersburg every year for meetings with friends, parents and politicians. There he meets the future president of Russia, Vladimir Putin. In the late 90s, having already become a US citizen, Herman moved to St. Petersburg for temporary residence and became a political adviser to the deputy, and later, Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Assembly of St. Petersburg Yuri Gladkov. He participates in many political events and conferences of the city and country. In 2005, Herman Obuhov establishes the Charity Foundation ‚ÄúOpen the World to Children‚Äù and was elected as its president; later, the Nobel Prize winner academic Zhores Alferov, Head of the SPP (Union of Right Forces) party Nikita Belykh and Senator from St. Petersburg Vadim Tulpanov joined the Foundation on the Board of Trustees. The Foundation helped over two thousand orphans to get computer skills by delivering computer classes to children's homes. In 2014 Obuhov moved to Kiev, Ukraine, to join the Maidan and create the Anti-Putin coalition, an informal association of public organizations and activists. In 2017, Herman establishes the Stop Inform Terror of Russia Foundation in Connecticut to resist Moscow‚Äôs information sabotage. Creative activity In the post-Soviet period, Herman Obuhov wrote and published five books: The Extinguished Dawn 15 Years Later, The Times of the Filibusters, The Confiscated Letters, The Chasm and The Stolen Country, as well as six screenplays: Flight to Johannesburg, New Jersey Turnpike, Gold Bird in a Gold Cage, Titian‚Äôs Gift, My Alaska and Trump's Friend ‚Äì Head of the Russian Mafia.

Her research in general is based on inorganic chemistry and magnetochemistry, specifically on molecular magnetism, EPR spectroscopy and quantum computing.  Education  Floriana completed her Bachelor of Science at University of Bucharest. She continued to read her Master of Science degree at University of Bucharest and successfully completed it in 1989 before moving to the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Romanian Academy to read her Doctor of Philosophy degree in transition metal chemistry, which was completed in 1997 and was supervised by Prof. Marius Andruh and Prof. Luminita Patron.  Research and career  Upon graduation, Floriana completed her postdoctoral research in Molecular Magnetism with Dr. Jean-Pascal Sutter at Institut de Chimie de la Mati√®re Condens√©e de Bordeauxwith (ICMCB), France and also as a visiting Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) Fellow at University of Heidelberg, Germany. She then received a Marie Curie Individual Fellowship at University of Warwick to work in supramolecular chemistry before moving to University of Manchester in 2003 as a Researcher. She was later promoted to the position of Senior Researcher. She is currently part of the Molecular Magnetism group at University of Manchester, working along with Prof. David Collison, Nicholas F. Chilton, Grigore Timco and Richard Winpenny. Floriana's research in general is based on inorganic chemistry and magnetochemistry, specifically on molecular magnetism, EPR spectroscopy and quantum computing.  Notable work  In 2019, Floriana participated in a research which reported the capability of a MFI-type zeolite (NbAlS-1) could be used to convert aqueous solutions of Œ≥-valerolactone (GVL) (obtained from biomass-derived carbohydrates) into butenes with a yield of more than 99% at ambient pressure under continuous flow conditions. The conversion of the renewable biomass into butenes offered the prospect for the sustainable production of butene as a platform chemical for the manufacture of renewable materials. In 2019, she participated in a research which showed the capability to use a porous metal‚Äìorganic framework (MOF) to provide a selective, fully reversible and repeatable capability to capture nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a toxic air pollutant produced particularly by diesel and bio-fuel use. The NO2 can then be easily converted into nitric acid, an industry with a wide range of uses including, agricultural fertilizer for crops; rocket propellant and nylon. In 2016, Floriana confirmed the capability to use pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure the covalency of actinide complexes in a research in collaboration with Eric McInnes and David P. Mills at the University of Manchester. Prior to this research, the extent of covalency in actinide complexes was less understood as this nature of bonding was not studied due to limited technology and methods of experimentation at the time. The use of pulsed EPR spectroscopy was able to determine the covalency of thorium(III) and Uranium(III) complexes for the first time and this paved the way to further research on the use of these complexes in the separation and recycling of nuclear waste.

The flattened mound, nearly a mile in length and between 33 and 50 feet tall, is described as the oldest and the largest Mayan ceremonial site known. The monumental structure is constructed of earth and clay, and is believed to have been built from around 1000 BC to 800 BC. Discovery The finding of Aguada F√©nix was announced in June 2020 by Takeshi Inomata, an archaeologist with the University of Arizona in Tucson, who is part a research team started in 2017 called the Middle Usumacinta Archaeological Project. The site is located near the San Pedro River in northeastern Tabasco. It was mapped from the air and excavation begun, resulting in finds including pottery and jade axes. Characteristics The large platform is conjectured by scientists to have been built by communal labor. The clay and earth rectangular mound is a quarter mile wide and 9/10 of a mile long, and in volume reported to be greater than the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

They were purchased in a joint order by SNCF and the Martigny‚ÄìCh√¢telard Railway (MCR) on March 30, 1994. Five trainsets were produced: three for SNCF (one of which was financed by the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region), and two for the MCR. Development As the Z 600 transits were wearing out, replacement for them was envisioned at the end of the 1980s. A joint order was created with SNCF and the MCR to replace the existing Z 600 transits. Five transits were ordered in 1994 from a consortium made up of Vevey Technologies (project coordination, assembly and construction of the boxes), Adtranz (electrical equipment) and SLM Winterthur (bogies, braking and rack and pinion equipment). Description For the trains be able to operate from Fayet to Martigny, they are equipped with security systems corresponding to the two lines. They can operate on the rack sections of the TMRs. Current collection is done by 3rd rail shoe or pantograph. The Z 800 multiple units are permanently coupled in pairs. There are power and communications connections the two multiple units of a train. The three SNCF trains are numbered Z 801/802 (train 1), Z 803/804 (train 2) and Z 805/806 (train 3), while those of the MC are Z 821 / 822 (train No. 21) and Z 823/824 (train No. 22). However, these are numbered BDeh 4/8 n ¬∞ 821/822 and 823/824 in the nomenclature of TMR. The odd numbered railcar is directed towards Fayet, and the even number railcar is directed towards Martigny. The new trainsets were delivered in 1996-1997, with three for SNCF and two for the MCR. Each unit is equipped with two bogies with two axles including a carrier and a motor. The motors have a power output of 1000 kW. A train can reach 70 km/h on an easy profile, on 70 mm/m (7 %) ramps, on upper ramps, and downhill. The Z 800s are equipped with five braking systems: * A compressed air brake applied to the wheels * A rheostatic and regenerative brake, intended to regulate the descent speed when going downhill * An emergency magnetic brake acting on the rails * A clasp brake * A disc brake The trainsets are fitted with a Scharfenberg coupler, which allows multiple trains to couple connect together during periods of heavy usage. It is also possible to couple them with Z 600 trainsets, which was notably done during test campaigns in 1997.

Description In 1978, Chaosium created the fantasy role-playing game RuneQuest, and used Greg Stafford's mythical world of Glorantha as the official setting. Stafford tightly controlled material proposed for Glorantha, editing or vetoing material that did not match \\"the complex Gloranthan cosmology, theology, biology, sociology, and politics.\\" In an article in Different Worlds in 1981, Stafford and co- author Lynn Abbey wrote, \\"Glorantha is a closed world, and is intended to stay that way.\\" Chaosium recognized the need for a more \\"open\\" world if RuneQuest was to expand its market share, and the result was a product called Questworld, where writers would be free to create RuneQuest material without Stafford's oversight. As Stafford wrote, \\"QuestWorld is intended to be an open campaign world for RuneQuest and its variants... Chaosium will minimally direct the development of this planet, intending it to serve as an example of an open world in the same way that Glorantha has been our example of a closed world.\\" Publication history Questworld was written by John E.

It contains * an 8-page introductory booklet * three booklets, each containing three linked adventures: ** Candlefire ** Greenwald Tales ** Lord Skyppen's Mansion * two maps * a reference sheet. Reception In the April 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue #72), Ken Rolston noted that although the materials were professionally produced, the writing \\"is a little more uneven than in several of the company‚Äôs other recent publications.\\" He found the included scenarios to be \\"well written, carefully introduced, and coherently organized,\\" although he found some of the adventures to be less compelling than others. He concluded \\"On balance, Questworld is a worthwhile purchase.\\" In the July 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #43), Oliver Dickinson had a lot of issues with the supplement. He criticized the lack of background detail, saying \\"Scarcely any detail of the history, population, etc., of Greenwald is provided, and the map shows a few major geographical features and a scattering of places, many not referred to anywhere in the text.\\" He also noted the many errors, commenting, \\"The pack shows many signs of having been compiled in haste, without adequate editorial supervision.\\" Finally Dickinson was not impressed with the quality of the nine adventures, saying, \\"All this might not matter so much if the actual adventures were really novel and interesting, but they are mostly conventional.\\" He concluded by giving the supplement a below average rating of 6 out of 10, stating, \\"Any hope that Chaosium's first publication on its own continent, Kanos, would give a lead in exploiting the new freedom will (it pains me to write it) be disappointed.\\" Other reviews *Fantasy Gamer #1 (Aug./Sept., 1983) References Category:RuneQuest supplements ","title":"Questworld (RuneQuest)"},{"id":"64314972","text":"Ensar Arslan (born 1 August 2001) is a German footballer who plays as a winger for Darmstadt 98.

He worked as a researcher in demographics and statistics at Makerere University in Uganda, with his main research projects focusing on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa, fertility, census-taking, and aging and the life cycle. A medical demographer and statistician by training, his areas of expertise include gauging needs assessment, conducting evaluations, and creating baseline studies. After retirement, he took up work as a farmer. In 2011, the book Demography of Uganda and Selected African Countries was published in honor of his research contributions.  Education  Ntozi attended Mbarara Junior High and High School.Ntozi, James. \\"Professor James P.M. Ntozi Remarks on Launch of a Book Recognizing his Long Services.\\" Makerere University. Makerere Main Hall, Uganda. 23 March 2017. In 1971, Ntozi earned his bachelor of science degree in Economics and Statistics from the Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics at Makerere University. Ntozi earned his master's degree at the institute in 1973. He gained his PhD in Medical Demography in 1977 from the University of London. From 1977 to 1979, Ntozi went to the University of Nairobi because of the political unrest during the reign of Idi Amin. However, many of his colleagues left at the beginning of the regime in the early 1970s while he remained at the university. Ntozi also attended Bishop School Mukono, Busoga College Mwiri, where he met Uganda's current Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda, and Oxford University.  Research  Ntozi has more than 75 peer reviewed scientific articles and more than 70 papers presented at conferences. He has also edited over 15 books. During the early years of Uganda's independence, there was little data on demographics. Ntozi worked on demographics during this period and tried to promote research in the field. His research within demographics has focused on fertility, mortality, migration, and development. In 1980, Ntozi was the commissioner for Uganda's census, the results of which led to policy changes and the government's demarcation of areas. In the 1990s, Ntozi conducted research on marriage patterns, fertility rates, and the cultural causes and effects of HIV/AIDS. Beginning in the late 1990s, Ntozi began his research on aging. Since then, he has given lectures at international conferences on his research, taught classes on aging, and mentored three PhD students in the subject. Ntozi helped evaluate the PEPFAR Project in Nigeria for the United States National Academy of Sciences (2005-2007). Starting in the 2010s, he began researching the impact of HIV/AIDS on Ugandan elderly.  Makerere University  Ntozi served multiple roles at Makerere University from 1979 until his forced retirement in 2016, including lecturer, head of department, dean, member of the university senate, and ambassador of the university. Ntozi served as the director of the Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics for seven years, and he lectured as a Professor of Population Studies, from which he retired in 2016. He has also served as a professor of demographic statistics at the university's College of Business and Management Studies and has been on many university boards. Ntozi began lecturing for Makerere in 1971 as a Teacher's Assistant while pursuing his master's degree. In October 1992, he was granted full professorship, and in 1995 he fulfilled the university's requirement of professors to give an inaugural lecture by presenting his research on HIV/AIDS. It was considered rare for a professor to complete this requirement within three years of the promotion to full professorship. During his time as a professor, Ntozi has mentored around ten PhD students in demography and mentored students from his affiliated departments as well as from the departments of geography, sociology, gender studies, and public health. He has also served on many university boards. Ntozi was a part of the university senate for more than 30 years. While on the senate, he fought for the university's departments in statistics and population studies. In 2016, he relinquished his position as Chair of the Makerere University Pensioners' Association (MUPA). While occupying this position, Ntozi advocated for the university's retiree's benefits and pensions. At the university, he founded the Department of Population Studies. He has also developed all existing programs as of 2017, both undergraduate and graduate, in the School of Statistics and Planning. During his years at Makerere, Ntozi has advanced the demographic and population studies at the university and mobilized resources and donations for the Department of Population Studies from the Rockefeller Foundation, World Bank, International Development Research Centre (IDRC), UNFPA, USAID, UNDP, and Population Council as well as other organizations. Despite being offered jobs on an international scale, Ntozi has declined all to stay at his alma mater. Because of Makerere University's requirement for professors to retire at the age of 70, Ntozi retired from lecturing in 2016 to work as a farmer. However, upon retirement he asked the university to continue allowing him to conduct research and mentor students at the Center for Population and Applied Sciences.  Demography of Uganda and Selected African Countries  The 276-page book Demography of Uganda and Selected African Countries: Towards more Sustainable Development Pathways was published in 2016 to celebrate Ntozi's service to Makerere University, Uganda, and all of Africa through his research in demographics. Written by scholars in demography and population studies, the book discusses the current needs of Uganda's population. It touches on issues around development, sustainability, and demography while also presenting findings to suggest changes in policies and programs. The editors include Professor John Oucho from the University of Nairobi as the Chief Editor, Associate Professor Dr. Gideon Rutaremwa, and Professor Jockey Baker Nyakaana, among others. The book has 15 writers and 4 editors from many countries and organizations such as Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, France, and the Uganda National Bureau of Standards. The launching of the book occurred on 23 March 2017 and was organized by the Makerere College of Business and Management Sciences as well as the Centre for Population and Applied Sciences. It took place in Makerere University's main hall. Prime Minister of Uganda Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda praised Ntozi for his research, claiming that it helped shape Uganda's policy. The two men had been friends for 51 years at this point, since they had met at Busoga College Mwiri. Rugunda declared that Ntozi's work in demographics helped save the country from poverty, and he hailed Ntozi as a promoter of change and progress.The Prime Minister encouraged the staff at Makerere to follow in Ntozi's footsteps, and for other university's to follow Makerere's example. He also asked Makerere to consider using retired professors, like Ntozi, for research, as is common in the US and UK. The Vice Chancellor of Makerere University Professor John Ddumba-Ssentamu thanked Ntozi for elevating the university's status on both a local and global scale. Ntozi gave a speech as well, thanking his students and the authors of the book for commemorating him during his lifetime. He also thanked the College of Business Management Sciences and the Centre for Population and Applied Statistics for publishing the book and hosting the event. Ntozi expressed his appreciation for the government of Uganda for being supportive of researchers. Ntozi received a plaque at the ceremony from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), presented by its Executive Director Ben Paul Mungyereza. The plaque was given in appreciation for his work at Makerere University and his support of UBOS. Prime Minister Rugunda gave Ntozi the plaque.  Achievements  Ntozi has been appointed many international positions at universities and institutions such as Visiting Scholar and Researcher.  Controversy  In 2011, a public dialogue at the Planning House in Kampala was held to discuss the increasing population growth and rates of unemployment.\\"Uganda Warned on Population Explosion.\\" AllAfrica.com, 26 October 2011. https://allafrica.com/stories/201110281170.html The report \\"Demography and Economic Growth in Uganda\\" was presented with a strategy of increased urbanization to boost economic stimulus and slow down population growth. Ntozi spoke out against the report at the dialogue, claiming that urbanization does not lead to economic development as seen by the existing poverty within cities. He also disagreed that electricity in rural areas would reduce population growth. In 2013, Ntozi called for a census, arguing that it was essential to create a development plan. He dismissed attempts by other researchers to make development plans for Uganda since the last census occurred in 2002. The Makerere University Retirement Benefits Scheme (MURBS) threatened to strike in 2014 against the university because of delayed payments. Makerere had been failing to pay retirement benefits unless taken to court, so MURBS had been filing cases against the university since 2008. Ntozi encouraged retirees to come together and demand their benefits from Makerere in court.  Personal life  Ntozi was born 25 July 1946 in Mbarara district in Kashari County, Rwobynje. In 1975, Ntozi married Dr. Ida Ntozi. They have children together.

He was detained in Russia in November 2016, and was later sentenced to two years in prison for unlawful access to computer information. Early career Anikeyev worked in the St. Petersburg media during the 1990s. He wasn't regarded as a great writer, but he was able to acquire many contacts in the Russian government. At a party in Russia around 2004, Anikeyev had reportedly met Alexander Glazastikov and Konstantin Teplyakov, two future members of Shaltai Boltai. In 2013, Anikeyev proposed the idea of occasionally publishing political materials that might be of interest to the public. Glazastikov concurred. The two would later discuss who would be called Shaltai and who would be called Boltai when communicating with reporters. Shaltai Boltai At the end of 2013, Shaltai Boltai gained instant fame in Russia when a leaked transcript of the speech that Vladimir Putin was planning to give on New Year's Eve was published on their blog. The following year, communications from high-profile figures like Arkady Dvorkovich and Yevgeny Prigozhin were published, culminating in the Shaltai Boltai blog being blocked by Russia authorities. In the summer of 2014, Anikeyev was reportedly approached by an intermediary of a potential client who was interested in acquiring the identities of members of Shaltai Boltai. By early 2016, due to concerns that Russian intelligence services would soon be able to identify Anikeyev's source network, operations at Shaltai Boltai were reportedly halted. FSB influence Teplyakov claims that Anikeyev was recruited by the FSB in August 2015. Other reports say Anikeyev's cooperation with the FSB, specifically Sergei Mikhailov (FSB) and Dmitry Dokuchaev, began sometime in 2016. Anikeyev himself has denied these reports. Arrest In October 2016, Anikeyev was reportedly lured away from Kiev and towards the border of Belarus, where he was detained and then transported to Russia. In January 2017, Anikeyev pleaded guilty to unlawful access to computer information. His arrest was first announced on January 28, 2017.

Two men were shot dead by Metropolitan Police officers while attempting to rob a cash-in-transit van at gunpoint. The Metropolitan Police's Flying Squad had been tracking a gang of armed robbers from South London, who had committed a series of robberies of security vans delivering to banks in small towns and villages outside London, where they believed the police response would be slower. Prior to Chandler's Ford, the gang were estimated to have stolen ¬£500,000 from 17 robberies. The Flying Squad received intelligence that the gang intended to target the HSBC branch in Chandler's Ford and, with assistance from specialist armed officers from CO19 (the Metropolitan Police firearms unit), planned to lie in wait and apprehend the suspects in the commission of the robbery. Armed police officers arrived in the early hours of the morning of 13 September and concealed themselves in a public toilet close to the bank, supported by snipers in overlooking buildings. At 10:05, shortly after the arrival of the G4S van, Mark Nunes (wearing a mask) approached the guard and pointed a gun at him, demanding he hand over the cash box. One of the snipers opened fire, hitting Nunes in the chest. As officers were deploying from their hiding place, a second gang member, Andrew Markland, ran over and picked up Nunes's weapon; he was shot twice by a second police sniper. As the officers arrived, they attempted first aid but Markland died at the scene. Nunes was airlifted to hospital but died later that day. The remaining gang members were arrested over the following days and charged with conspiracy to rob. At their trial, footage from a police surveillance post at Chandler's Ford was shown to the jury, including the attempted robbery and the moment Nunes and Markland were shot. The shooting was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which concluded that the armed officers had acted properly, though found flaws in the planning of the operation. An inquest held in 2011 reached a verdict of lawful killing, after which the IPCC published its full report, recommending that a firearms commander independent of the investigation be appointed to lead future operations. The Metropolitan Police implemented the recommendation. Prelude In 2007, the Flying Squad of London's Metropolitan Police, a unit specialising in investigating armed robberies, was pursuing a criminal gang responsible for a series of bank robberies. The gang, led by Mark Nunes and Andrew Markland, consisted largely of career criminals from South London. Nunes had been released from prison in 2005, having served several years for previous robberies. In the 18 months prior to September 2007, the gang had targeted banks in small towns and villages in the home counties and some further afield, where they anticipated that the police response would be slower and more limited than in London.Smith, p. 219. The gang were responsible for at least 18 robberies, some as far away as Bristol (over from London), from which they had stolen around ¬£500,000. The Flying Squad received intelligence that the gang intended to rob a G4S cash-in-transit van as it delivered to the HSBC bank branch in Chandler's Ford, Hampshire. The gang had used a handgun in previous robberies and had fired at bank staff and members of the public and were believed to be in possession of armour-piercing ammunition, which they apparently intended to fire into the van if the crew did not comply with their demands. Thus, the Flying Squad opted to employ armed officers from CO19, the Metropolitan Police's specialist firearms unit. The police planned to have armed officers lie in wait for the gang in a concealed location close to the bank, in order to arrest the gang members in the act, along with snipers providing cover from nearby buildings. The local police force, Hampshire Constabulary, agreed to allow the Metropolitan Police to control the operation, codenamed Operation Hurlock.Squires & Kennison, p. 184. Robbery In the early hours of 13 September 2007, Flying Squad and CO19 officers attended a briefing at Leman Street police station in East London before travelling to Chandler's Ford, arriving at around 04:00. Armed officers took up position in a block of public toilets about from the bank, supported by snipers in vantage points overlooking the bank. The officers concealed in the toilet block were kept informed of events through radio communication with the snipers. At around 06:00, the team received word that several gang members were travelling towards Chandler's Ford in a stolen vehicle. At around 09:15, police officers observed Markland at a bus stop close to the bank. Other gang members were spotted in the village shortly afterwards, some repeatedly driving past the bank in a stolen vehicle. Shortly before 10:00, Nunes arrived in a second stolen vehicle and parked in a space opposite the bank. A few minutes later, the G4S van arrived and the guard on board began carrying cash boxes into the bank. At 10:05, Nunes approached the guard, pointing a handgun at his chest, causing him to freeze. One of the police snipers opened fire. Nunes, hit in the chest, collapsed at the guard's feet. By this time, the armed officers hiding in the toilet block were running towards the bank. Meanwhile, Markland ran across to Nunes and picked up the gun. As he stood back up with the weapon, he was shot by the second police sniper. Hit in the chest, Markland collapsed; he was seen moving on the ground and the sniper fired again.Smith, p. 220.Squires & Kennison, p. 189. Police officers attempted to administer first aid as they reached the van but Markland died at the scene. Nunes was taken to Southampton General Hospital by the Hampshire & Isle of Wight Air Ambulance but died later the same day. The security guard suffered a minor injury to his hand, having been grazed by a bullet. The remaining gang members fled the area in one of the stolen vehicles.Punch, p. 199. Aftermath Still taken from the police video of the robbery showing the moment a masked figure (Nunes) confronts the security guard, pointing a handgun at him. The video was shown to jurors in the trial of the other gang members and at the inquest into Nunes' and Markland's deaths. Over the following days, the Metropolitan Police conducted armed raids at multiple addresses across London and arrested seven other gang members. They were charged with conspiracy to rob and various other offences in connection with Chandler's Ford and seventeen other robberies. They were convicted in August 2008 received prison sentences ranging from five to seventeen years. During the trial, the jury was shown a video of the Chandler's Ford robbery taken by police officers from one of the snipers' posts, including the moments Nunes and Markland were shot. Stills from the footage were later released to the media. On the video, a man in a balaclava (identified as Nunes) can be seen approaching the guard with a handgun raised and a police officer can be heard saying into a radio: \\"Robbery, robbery. Strike, strike, strike! He has a gun to his head\\", almost immediately followed by a gunshot.Squires & Kennison, p. 190. As with all shootings by police officers, an independent investigation was launched by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).Smith, p. 221. The IPCC released its preliminary report in October 2008. It found that, \\"although there are issues around the implementation of the operation\\", the police marksmen had not committed any misconduct, and had acted properly, in line with national guidelines for the conduct of armed officers.Squires & Kennison, pp. 185, 190. An inquest was held in Winchester in 2011, at which the jury was shown the police surveillance footage of the robbery and shooting. After hearing evidence from the police officers involved, the IPCC, and eyewitnesses, the coroner directed the jury that they could only return an open verdict or one of lawful killing. The jury decided on lawful killing, though the coroner noted that there were several opportunities for the police to arrest Nunes and Markland safely but these were not taken as the police felt they had insufficient evidence to secure a conviction. The families of the deceased expressed disappointment that the coroner had not allowed the jury to record a narrative verdict, which they felt would have better enabled the jury to \\"identify any failures in the police operation that they considered caused or more than minimally contributed to the men's deaths\\". The Metropolitan Police issued a statement saying \\"These circumstances illustrate clearly the immensely difficult and split-second decisions that officers have to make when protecting the public from the actions of armed criminals\\" and promised to review the findings of the inquest and the IPCC. Following the inquest, the IPCC released its full report, which contained several recommendations. Among them was that a separate firearms commander‚Äîindependent of the investigation‚Äîbe appointed for similar operations in the future to better balance public safety against the need to gather evidence. In a statement, the IPCC said \\"We will never know if there would have been a different outcome had the Metropolitan Police separated the role\\". The Metropolitan Police implemented the recommendation before the report was published.Smith, p. 221. According to Peter Squires and Peter Kennison, British criminologists with a focus on armed policing, the public reaction to the shooting was generally positive. The academics observed that, unlike in other incidents they studied, the police appeared to have shot the \\"right\\" men, in so far as the only people killed were armed criminals in the commission of a robbery. Nonetheless, they pointed out that the operation could only be seen as a \\"qualified success\\", given that its stated objectives included the apprehension of the suspects, and observed that the security guard could easily have sustained much more serious injuries. They believed that the shooting and the lengthy prison sentences for the other gang members sent a \\"clear message\\" about police handling of armed crime, even if the shooting raised questions about the planning of the operation.Squires & Kennison, p. 185.

To support their allegations, the initiators of the letter and petition referred to commentaries and interviews and Jacques Leider's participation in a panel discussion ‚ÄúTalk on Rakhine Issue and Security Outlook‚Äù on September 8, 2017, in the capital city of Naypyidaw that had been organized by a media company owned by Myanmar‚Äôs military.https://www.gnlm.com.mm/rakhine-issue-security-outlook- talk/https://www.irrawaddy.com/from-the-archive/history-behind-rakhine-state- conflict.htmlhttps://thewire.in/182611/frictions-rakhine-state-less- islamophobia-rohingya-phobiahttps://thediplomat.com/2016/03/the-truth-about- myanmars-rohingya-issue/ In response to the campaign, Oxford University Press issued an editorial statement declaring that ‚Äú[s]cholarly integrity lies at the core of Oxford University Press‚Äôs mission. The history of the Rohingya is a complex and contentious area of research and, as always, the Press‚Äôs goal is to represent this history with accuracy, balance, and sensitivity. Dr. Jacques Leider was commissioned by the editorial board of the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Asian History based on his subject-matter expertise. The decision on whether to accept his article for publication was informed principally by the outcome of an external peer review exercise and the scholarly assessment of the Press‚Äôs editorial board, which is composed of career historians of Asia.‚Äùhttps://oxfordre.com/asianhistory/page/statement- jacques-leider Leider‚Äôs article with the title ‚ÄúRohingya: The History of a Muslim Identity in Myanmar‚Äù was published by Oxford Research Encyclopedias, Asian History, in May 2018.https://oxfordre.com/asianhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277727-e-115?rskey=qtJ0AU&result;=1 In the footnote of an article published in 2020, Leider referred to the criticism of his research on identity formation explaining that ‚Äú[p]ost- colonial anthropology looks at ethnic formation differently from the old culturalist models which essentialize ethnic identity (as we find it in the Myanmar constitutions). We need to be able to differentiate ‚Äòethnification‚Äô (in the tradition of Benedict Anderson‚Äôs ‚Äòimagined community‚Äô) and political struggle, and to understand how they overlap. All ethnic identities are constructed one way or another, and all identities may be used politically, for example when members of one group adopt a term as a unifying device. Sensitivity is in place when there is such a process of coming together or community-formation. I have been criticized for showing lack of such sensitivity in an interview I gave to a Myanmar newspaper in 2012 (The Irrawaddy, ‚ÄúHistory Behind Arakan State Conflict‚Äù, 9 July 2012). It should probably be pointed out that I was not afforded an opportunity to review the draft of the article before it was published, and the newspaper re-published it twice without requesting or obtaining my agreement.‚ÄùJ.

The interpretation of someone's race, including their self-identification and identification by others, can change over the course of a lifetime, including in response to social situations. The racial identity of groups can change over time as well. Applications and examples=Latin America The conception of racial identity is considered especially fluid in Latin America. Racial classification varies among countries, and is mostly based on the appearance of skin color without regard to one's ancestry. In the Dominican Republic, about half of those with the darkest skin color self- identify as Black, compared to 90% in Panama. There is a high usage of self- identification terms like pardo, mulato, indio, moreno, and mestizo for those with dark skin color. Mulato is considered a particularly fluid designation, used by people of all skin colors. Social status impacts how people self- identify, with more wealthy people in Brazil self-identifying as White, regardless of actual skin color. The wealthier an individual is, the more likely they are to self-identify as White. In Colombia, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, researchers did not discover a link between wealth and racial identity. Education plays a role in self-identification, with the highly educated in the Dominican Republic more likely to identify as Black. The role of age is variable; older respondents in Brazil were more likely to self-identify as White, compared to older respondents in Dominican Republic who were more likely to self-identify as Black. Even the skin color of the interviewer was noted to have an effect on identification. Brazilians and Colombians were more likely to self-identify as \\"darker\\" racial categories when talking to a darker interviewer, whereas Panamanians and Dominicans were more likely to \\"whiten\\" their responses while being surveyed by a darker interviewer. A person's gender also influences their self-identification. Researchers speculated that racial boundaries were more porous for men than for women. Brazilian men were about 25% more likely than Brazilian women to self-identify as White. United States Racial fluidity can apply to both groups of people and individuals, including how individuals self-identify and how they are perceived by others. The availability and use of racial fluidity is generally limited to three circumstances in the US: a small number of Americans with mixed ancestries, including those who identify as Native American, Hispanic, or biracial; changes in social hierarchies that resulted in the \\"whitening\\" of previously nonwhite groups; people from highly racially heterogeneous countries, such as Brazil. =Individuals= On the individual level, racial fluidity is particularly applicable to those with mixed racial heritage, particularly, in the US, of White and another race. A person could present as white in socially advantageous circumstances, such interacting with law enforcement or applying for an apartment. Conversely, they could use their non-white identity in the limited situations where it is more valuable, such as applying to college scholarships. Racial self-identification tends to be very stable in the US, with the most stability seen in White and Black people, and variation in identification seen in Hispanic and multiracial people. On an individual level, people most frequently self-identify the same race or ethnicity on the US census, with 6% of participants changing their responses from 2000 to 2010. Native Americans had the highest level of fluidity; of the 3.3 million who listed Native American ethnicity in the 2000 and 2010 censuses, only one third listed the same ethnicity for both. Self- identification of race may be situational, with immigrants from the Dominican Republic much more likely to self-identify as black while in the US than while in the Dominican Republic. Research on the effect of genealogical DNA tests on racial self-identification has found, rather than embracing the full report, test recipients select a few aspects of their background to embrace based on favored identities or socially accepted ones. Racial identity as perceived by others is also subject to change over time. The perception of whiteness by others is increased when someone gets married or increases their social standing. Perception of blackness by others is increased when someone loses employment or otherwise loses social standing. The political beliefs of the observer also influence their perceptions. When viewing a racially ambiguous face, White conservatives are more likely than White liberals to apply the one-drop rule and categorize the face as \\"Black\\". =Groups= Historically, in the US, Jewish, Italian, and Irish people were once considered non-white, though as \\"whiteness\\" is not rigidly defined, these groups \\"became\\" White over time by seeking to distance themselves from Black Americans. Once considered White, Italian and Irish immigrants were less likely to experience harassment and discrimination.

The gay-owned brand has since expanded into a full clothing line, including underwear, jockstraps, jeans, shorts, T-shirts, and swimwear, among other accessories, and mostly targets gay men. Sexual fetishism remains an influence; Nasty Pig has carried bondage harnesses and straps, as well as rubber jockstraps and bedding. The company has also sold silk woven neckties displaying the brand's logo \\"intricately hidden within the weave of the material\\". Out Stacy Lambe has described the brand's aesthetic as \\"a refined combo of punk attitude, street graffiti, and high-tech materials\\". Michael Kleinmann of The Underwear Expert has called Nasty Pig a \\"masculine sportswear line with an unabashed fetish edge\\" and \\"a connection to a raunchy, sexual subculture of some kind\\". ChicagoPride.com's Ross Forman has described Nasty Pig as \\"the ultimate edgy clothing brand for the masculine, sexually self-assured male consumers\\", with \\"bold stripes and loud colors\\". The brand's motto is \\"fun clothing that gets you laid\\". History With $50 and a sewing machine, Nasty Pig Incorporated was formed on October 31, 1994, by partners Frederick Kearney and David Lauterstein, who continue to serve as creative director and chief executive officer, respectively. The couple met in New York City in 1993 and began selling \\"re:vision goggles\\" with refractive lenses to the Club Kids. Profits allowed Kearney and Lauterstein to start sewing and selling clothing from their West 23rd Street apartment. Nasty Pig, named after their dog Piggy, was created in response to stigmas caused by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. According to Lauterstein, the brand was influenced by New York City's hip hop culture and sports, including baseball, basketball, CrossFit, football, mixed martial arts, and weightlifting. The couple's first \\"closet-sized\\" 72-square-foot store, called 're:vision', sold Nasty Pig T-shirts, rubber chaps and superhero sleeveless shirts, and vinyl pants, among other products. Nasty Pigs' first retail clients were the Leatherman and Mr. S in New York City and San Francisco, respectively. The brand grew nationally after being heavily featured at Chicago's International Mr. Leather, an annual fetish and leather conference and contest. According to ChicagoPride.com's Ross Forman, \\"Nasty Pig gained notoriety for its line of machine-washable Nasty Pig Rubber, highlighted by Nasty Pig Playsheets, and has seemingly gone wild from there. Nasty Pig quickly became the brand-of-choice for the young, fetish scene in New York ‚Äì and spread worldwide from there.\\" Nasty Pig became \\"the first sportswear company in their industry to sell branded jockstraps\\", and the brand's jeans line (NP Jean) became a \\"best-selling stretch denim style\\". Nasty Pig ranked number 3,060 the Inc. 5000, Inc. list of the fastest growing U.S. companies, in 2013. The company's 2013 \\"video lookbook\\" featured Juliana Huxtable and several \\"gay nightlife personalities\\". Nasty Pig relocated to a larger flagship store on West 19th Street in Chelsea, Manhattan in 2014. In 2015, the company's 30-second \\"Give/Receive\\" advertisement was considered \\"too hot for TV\\" by Time Warner Cable executives. The commercial was scheduled to air on the Cartoon Network, Lifetime, Logo TV, and TBS, but was pulled after four runs on Logo in New York markets. Nasty Pig also advertised during American Horror Story: Freak Show in Los Angeles and New York, before launching its first national advertising campaign in 2015 during RuPaul's Drag Race. The brand's products have been worn by James Franco, Lady Gaga, and Madonna. Nasty Pig and Versace outfitted Olly Alexander for his 2018 Paper magazine photo shoot. PinkNews, In 2020, Queerty and Slate praised Lauterstein for his advice for navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. He also helped the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene update its 'Safer Sex and COVID-19' guidelines with more specific recommendations for dating and sex during the pandemic. Lauterstein was included in Crain's New York Business 2020 list of \\"notable LGBTQ leaders and executives\\". Activism and impact In 2013, Nasty Pig launched Shred of Hope, an auction of celebrity-designed \\"shredder\\" T-shirts benefitting New York City's Ali Forney Center, the largest LGBT community center in the U.S. Participants included Dustin Lance Black, Keith Boykin, Andy Cohen, Alan Cumming, Isis King, Adam Lambert, Bob Mould, Njena Reddd Foxxx, Mike Ruiz, JD Samson, Dan Savage, Jake Shears, Ally Sheedy, and Michael Stipe. According to The Advocate, Nasty Pig grew \\"from a $50 investment to a global name in apparel ‚Äî one that has had its own indelible role in influencing the worlds of kink, fetish, queer, and even high fashion\\". The magazine has described the brand as a \\"trailblazing menswear label\\". Ross Forman of ChicagoPride.com wrote, \\"[Kearney and Lauterstein] developed the first gay culture brand, and Nasty Pig hasn't just survived over the years, it has thrived.\\" According to Out, Nasty Pig was among the first companies to \\"champion hairy, bearded models in its marketing materials, contradicting the era's\\" male beauty standards.

The principle is derived from an episode in the Book of Ezra, where Ezra the Scribe commanded the Jewish people to return to their former country, threatening to confiscate the property of anyone who refuses to go-up to the Land of Israel, after having lived in exile.Maimonides, Mishne Torah (Hil. Sanhedrin 24:6) The principle appears in the Talmud, being derived from the Mishnah, as well as from the Hebrew Bible,Ezra 10:8; Mishnah (Shekalim 1:2), Babylonian Talmud (Mo ªed ·∏≤a·π≠an 16a; Yevamot 89b) according to which a court may transfer property from its owners without legal or formal justification, as it deems fit. > Whosoever will not come within three days, according to the counsel of the > princes and the elders, all his property will be confiscated, while he, > himself, separated from the congregation of those that had been carried > away.  Implications  This principle has far-reaching consequences, since it is possible to formally uproot things and which will become binding upon all parties, in so far as the Mosaic Law is concerned, by changing the monetary status of the thing in question. For example, according to one approach, the expropriation of money given by a man for his wife's betrothals, if a Jewish court should decide to take this route, it can make the money with which the husband consecrated his wife null and void, in which case the betrothals were, in retrospect, of no force whatsoever, seeing as the woman was betrothed by money and did not belong to the man who assayed to betroth her. In addition, by the power vested unto the Sages of Israel by this law, they are able to change the standard laws of inheritance prescribed in the Law of Moses (henceforth: Torah). There is a deliberate debate as to whether a court can transfer an object from one person to another, or whether it can only remove an object into a state of being ownerless.Cf. the dispute between Ketzos HaChoshen ¬ß 235:4 and Netivot Ha-Mishpat ¬ß 235:13 Another discussion is about whether an act of taking possession as enacted by the Sages of Israel and whose validity is derived only from a rabbinic ordinance is considered a valid act of acquisition in matters directly affecting a biblical law or injunction, in what concerns a court ruling property as ownerless, so that the same property may now be used to betroth a woman.Cf. Ketzos HaChoshen ¬ß 194:3 Most rabbinic scholars hold the view that, although the principle is taken from the Book of Ezra, the ruling is tantamount to a ruling taken from the Torah. The Shittah Mekubetzet explains that the court's power to dispense with a particular thing does not yet confer it upon another, the court merely relinquishing the object from its first owners, and giving permission to another to acquire that object.Shittah Mekubetzet in the Babylonian Talmud (Baba Bathra 100a), s.v. ◊ß◊†◊ô◊ô◊ü ◊î◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ö Based on this rule, Nissim of Gerona explained the possibility of judges who have not been ordained by rabbis that can trace a line of authority back to Moses as being able to engage partly in monetary matters. Rabbi Joseph Karo, citing the Tur, also permits a court to apply this principle whenever it deems it necessary to bring offenders into submission, even though the arbiters have not been ordained by the laying on of hands.Joseph Karo, Shulchan Arukh (Choshen Mishpat, Hil. Dayanim 2:1) While a court, under ordinary circumstances, has no power to uproot a prohibitive command from the Torah, except in cases where the intent is to bring instruction for a limited time only, in this case they are permitted to expropriate another's property without limitation, in order to instill correction where needed. This principle has also allowed others to justify the introduction of public regulations in Jewish communities, in terms of halacha. This justification was done by way of inference. First, the court has the ability to decide things that are not governed by a permanent law - the abandonment of property is just one example. Secondly, a court is an example of an institution that is agreed upon by the community and, hence, it can be said that the elected officials also meet this criterion and can therefore make an amendment to the Torah. That is, as long as they do not violate explicit prohibitions written in the Torah (excepting the provisions on monetary laws, which are permitted).

The unit was formed on November 16, 1862, and was originally commanded by Colonel John Bullock Clark Jr. At the Battle of Prairie Grove on December 7, 1862, the regiment was officially in Brigadier General John S. Roane's brigade, although it served with Brigadier General Mosby M. Parsons' brigade for most of the battle. After spending the summer of 1863 harassing Union Navy shipping on the Mississippi River, the regiment was reorganized, with elements of an Arkansas unit being replaced with the 8th Missouri Infantry Battalion. After the reorganization, the regiment fought in the Battle of Pleasant Hill and the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry in April 1864. On June 7, 1865, the men of the regiment were paroled; they would eventually be sent back to Missouri via steamboat. Organization Colonel John Bullock Clark Jr. The 9th Missouri Infantry Regiment originated when John Bullock Clark Jr., a veteran of the Missouri State Guard, was placed in command of four companies of newly recruited Missourians with the intention of sending them to Fort Smith, Arkansas. Clark's recruits were combined with the men of Clarkson's Independent Ranger Battalion, an Arkansas-raised unit. The new regiment, which was mustered into Confederate service on November 16, appears to have contained only eight companies, as opposed to the standard ten; this arrangement violated Confederate regulations for the formation of regiments. Clark was appointed the regiment's first colonel, Michael W. Buster (formerly of Clarkson's unit) was the first lieutenant colonel, and James Quinn Morton served as the original major. As of November 16, the regiment contained eight companies, designated with the letters AE and GI. Companies A, B, C, and H contained men from Missouri while the others contained men from Arkansas; the Arkansas men came from Clarkson's Independent Ranger Battalion. Service history=1862 The unit, known as Clark's Missouri Infantry, was assigned to the brigade of Brigadier General John S. Roane. The regiment's strength was reported at 594 men on December 1, 1862. At the Battle of Prairie Grove on December 7, Roane's brigade contained four cavalry regiments from Texas and two artillery batteries from Arkansas, in addition to Clark's Missouri Infantry. During the early stages of the battle, Roane's brigade was sent to the Confederate left to align next to Brigadier General Mosby M. Parsons' brigade. Later in the fighting, Roane detached the regiment to serve with Parsons' brigade, which was making a charge against the Union line; it served on the left flank of Parsons' line. Clark's Missouri Infantry hit the right flank of Colonel William A. Weer's brigade, but heavy Union artillery fire blunted the charge. Parsons' brigade was eventually able to force back Weer's brigade by turning the Union left flank, and another charge was made. The regiment was also on Parsons' left for this charge, but heavy Union artillery fire forced the regiment to retreat in the early stages of the charge, which eventually failed. The regiment suffered 26 casualties during the battle. After Prairie Grove, the regiment retreated to Van Buren, Arkansas, where it remained until December 28. 1863 On January 4, 1863, while the regiment was in the process of transferring to Little Rock, Arkansas, a new brigade was formed. Clark was placed in command of the brigade, and the regiment was assigned to it. The regiment did not reach Little Rock until January 16. On February 7, the regiment was moved via steamboat to White's Bluff, Arkansas. Not long afterwards, the regiment boarded the Granite State for transfer to Day's Bluff, Arkansas, where it encamped at Fort Pleasant. On June 12, Clark's brigade began a raid to the Mississippi River, with the intention of harassing Union Navy shipping. The brigade, including Clark's Missouri Infantry, attacked a gunboat and several transport vessels on June 22, causing some damage. The unit then damaged more Union shipping on June 27 before returning to Fort Pleasant on July 13. The regiment was officially redesignated as the 9th Missouri Infantry Regiment on July 23. In late July, the regiment built fortifications designed to protect Little Rock, which was threatened by Union Major General Frederick Steele. On September 10, the 9th Missouri Infantry evacuated Little Rock and retreated to Arkadelphia, Arkansas. =Reorganization= On September 30, the Arkansas- raised companies of Clarkson's former Independent Ranger Battalion were transferred out of the regiment to form a new battalion and were replaced by six companies from the 8th Missouri Infantry Battalion. Clark retained nominal command of the unit, although Richard H. Musser was appointed as lieutenant colonel of the regiment. Richard Gaines was the regiment's new major. As of September 30, the regiment contained 10 companies, designated with the letters AI and K; all of which were Missouri-raised. The new regiment was then assigned to the brigade of Brigadier General Thomas F. Drayton, with which it transferred to Camp Bragg on October 20, where it spent the rest of 1863 in winter quarters. 18641865 Battle of Pleasant Hill On January 12, 1864, Clark was elevated to brigade command, and Musser replaced Clark as commander of the regiment. On January 29, the regiment left Camp Bragg and moved to a location in Hempstead County, Arkansas. In March, the 9th Missouri Infantry began moving towards Shreveport, Louisiana, which it reached on March 25. Additionally, on the 25th, a new division was formed from Parsons' brigade and Clark's brigade; Parsons commanded the new entity. Parsons' division left Shreveport on April 3 to come to the aid of Major General Richard Taylor, who was resisting a Union advance up the Red River. The unit reached Taylor at Pleasant Hill, Louisiana on April 9. At the Battle of Pleasant Hill later that day, Parsons' division was on the right of the Confederate line, and Clark's brigade was to the right of Parsons' other brigade, which was commanded Colonel Simon P. Burns. The initial charge was successful, breaking through the line of a Union brigade and capturing two artillery batteries. However, a Union counterattack hit Parsons' flank, and the Confederate attack broke, with the men retreating in disorder. The 9th Missouri Infantry officially reported 113 casualties, although Musser later stated that he believed the true count was about 175 men. After Pleasant Hill, the unit moved north to confront Steele, whose Union force was occupying Camden, Arkansas. Steele retreated in the face of the Confederate advance, but his force was caught at the crossing of the Saline River. At the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry on April 30, the 9th Missouri Infantry was still in Clark's brigade, which also contained the 8th Missouri Infantry Regiment and Ruffner's Missouri Battery. Parsons' division arrived at the Jenkins' Ferry battlefield around 9:00 a.m., and deployed over the course of the next hour. Burns' brigade was positioned on the left, and Clark's on the right. Clark's brigade attacked alongside the brigade of Colonel Lucien C. Gause. Clark and Gause's attack was aided by artillery fire from Ruffner's Battery and Lesueur's Missouri Battery, but thick mud impeded the attack. Between the thick mud and a counterattack by the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry Regiment, the Confederate attack was unable to crack the Union line. The Kansas regiment also captured three Confederate cannons. The battle ended with Steele's force escaping across the Saline. The regiment suffered 52 casualties at Jenkins' Ferry. Jenkins' Ferry was the last major combat action the regiment saw; the unit spent the rest of the war stationed at various points in Arkansas and Louisiana. On June 7, 1865, the survivors of the regiment were paroled at Alexandria, Louisiana; the steamboat B. L. Hodge transported the men back to Missouri.

The author of the work collected a large number of teachings, minhagim, popular costumes, halakic decisions and even stories from numerous authors, which displays the ordinary life of the Jews in the Rhine country during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The manuscript is currently held in the Montefiore College Library, and is almost throughout endowed with vowel-signs. Making it the only non-liturgical and non-Biblical text of its kind.  Contents  The contest of the work mostly deal with the laws relating to divorce, Rosh Hashanah, tefillin, the ritual slaughtering of animals, the observance of Shabbat and the observance of Passover, with a description of the ritual of the Seder. The work also discuses medical prescriptions, charms, marriage ceremonies, numerous commercial and religious contracts, various forms of excommunication, and mourning and burial customs.Lastly, at the end of the work is a summery of all material discussed. The vocalization of the work has been studied by scholars, who have concluded that medieval German Ashkenazi vocalization was much akin to contemporary Sephardic vocalization.  Character  The author of Sefer Asufot compiles several rich literary resources, which displays more interest in every branch of religious life than the majority of similar compilers. Particularly, the author often mentions local customs and even superstitions. Additionally, the accuracy with which he indicates the sources of his information is far beyond his contemporaries. From a philological point of view, the book possesses considerable interest, from the fact that numerous German glosses are found in the text that explain difficult or obscure terms, and some that show, incidentally, the intimate knowledge of German possessed by the Jews of that time.

It is responsible for training new musicians. It was created in Siegburg on 1 July 1960 and has been stationed in Hilden since 1969. It is subordinate to the other 13 music bands of the Bundeswehr and the Military Music Center of the Bundeswehr in Bonn. Every year the training band goes on a concert tour to demonstrate the success of their training. The task of the training band is to pave the way for young musicians to become professionals and to prepare them for future service in the Bundeswehr. Many members of the vand come from the Robert Schumann Hochschule in D√ºsseldorf. It consists of a teaching staff, three officers and one bandmaster, which coordinate and manage the training company, which offers can accommodate up to 150 musicians. History Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Deisenroth, known as a composer and arranger of numerous pieces of music and, in 1947, founder of the Hilchenbach Folk Music School, a predecessor of the South Westphalia Philharmonic,http://www.siwiarchiv.de/wp- content/uploads/2012/07/Orchestergeschichte-1957bis1997.Wolf_.pdf developed the concept for the military musical institution of the Bundeswehr in Siegburg. He created it on 1 July 1960. That November, Captain Ludwig K√ºhlechner became head of the training platoon and in December the first concerts took place under his leadership and that of his senior deputy, Sergeant Major Joseph Hoser. The following year, contracts were established with what is now the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Tanz K√∂ln. On 5 May 1969, the band was moved from Siegburg to the Waldkaserne in Hilden.

The puzzle's name is owed to the use of cat hair as a fake mustache, which protagonist Gabriel Knight uses as part of a disguise in order to steal a man's motorcycle rental. The puzzle was created by the game's producer, Steven Hill, following a puzzle being worked on by the game's creator, Jane Jensen, having to be cut due to budgetary reasons. The designers disliked the puzzle, but because of time constraints, it had to be left in. The puzzle has received generally negative reception, identified as one of the causes of adventure games becoming less popular due to it being too obtuse and frustrating. Game designer Erik Wolpaw was highly critical of it, blaming Jane Jensen for it despite her non-involvement. Wolpaw's article caused Jensen to face harassment from people who thought her a poor game designer for it, a portion whom Jensen noted had not played the game. Puzzle and solution In Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned, players control protagonist Gabriel Knight. At one point during the game, Gabriel is tasked with impersonating another man in order to take his motorcycle rental. In order to do this, Gabriel must collect a variety of items. Grabiel creates a mustache using masking tape, which he puts a piece of on a shed door. Gabriel uses a hose to spray a cat which is on top of a fence, causing the cat to run through the shed door. This causes part of the cat's fur to be torn off, which he takes. Gabriel then must distract the man by getting him to come downstairs and use a piece of candy to distract him, causing the man to bend over while outside of his room and allowing Gabriel to steal his passport. Gabriel then heads to the man's room in order to steal his gold coat and don it, along with a red cap he finds in the lost and found to hide that he had hair, unlike the man. Gabriel then uses a packet of maple syrup to adhere the fur to his face, creating a false mustache. Using a magic marker, Gabriel then adds a fake mustache to the passport in order to obscure the differences between their faces. He then returns, disguise complete, and successfully takes the man's motorcycle rental. Concept and creation The puzzle was created by Gabriel Knight 3 producer Steven Hill, as a result of a puzzle created by the game's creator, Jane Jensen, needing to be removed due to budget concerns. The cat hair mustache puzzle was unpopular with the game's lead technical designer, Scott Bilas, as well as other members of the development team, but was included due to time constraints. Jensen attributed the difficulty of the cat hair mustache puzzle to both the length of the puzzle and the lack of hints, though felt it was overblown, even though she didn't like it herself. Reception and legacy The puzzle was criticized for the differences between Gabriel and the man he was impersonating, particularly the lack of a mustache on the man. The cat hair mustache puzzle has received generally negative reception from critics, coming to be known as shorthand for \\"obscure and illogical actions\\" players may need to take in adventure games. PC World writer Hayden Dingman called it an \\"infamous\\" puzzle and emblematic of how difficult Sierra games can be. Kotaku writer Kirk Hamilton identified it as a \\"terrible-adventure- game-puzzle icon\\" and that no one would be able to solve it without a strategy guide. In their review of Gabriel Knight 3, Computer Gaming World writer Tom Chick identified it as the most notable aspect of the game, despite finding puzzles later in the game being more difficult. They explain that the earlier appearance of the puzzle caused a greater impact on the experience as a result. Gamasutra writer Christian Nutt felt that the puzzle was obtuse, stating that it was not something a player would think to do. Hardcore Gaming 101 writer Kurt Kalata called it the game's most \\"infamous\\" puzzle; he felt that such an \\"odd\\" puzzle would be appropriate for a more cartoony game like Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle, but that the Gabriel Knight series is more firmly grounded in realism, making the puzzle seem \\"absurd.\\" A puzzle in the video game Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse requires players to make a goatee and mustache using adhesive strips and stuffed dog fur, spurring IGN writer Chuck Osborn to speculate whether it was a reference to the cat hair mustache puzzle. Jane Jensen took some blame for the death of adventure games due to Gabriel Knight 3, with game designer Erik Wolpaw placing blame on her for the puzzle's poor design. Wolpaw was critical of the puzzle for requiring people to make a fake mustache in order to impersonate someone without a mustache, and that the actual process of constructing the mustache went beyond sense. Jensen faced backlash for this puzzle despite not being responsible for it; she received harassment from people who read Wolpaw's speech, calling it \\"typical Internet hate,\\" and discussed how these people viewed her as \\"the worst game designer in the world\\" as a result of it. GamesRadar+ writer Charlie Barratt included it in their list of the \\"stupidest puzzles\\" in video games, suggesting that the puzzle was \\"illogical and irrational\\" and that the puzzle contributed to adventure games dying out. Despite the blame laid on the puzzle for killing adventure games, author Grant Bollmer disputed this notion, instead placing blame on corporate restructuring, \\"meddling in the creative process,\\" and an \\"increasing scale\\" in video games' popularity. Campo Santo designer and programmer Nels Anderson felt that adventure games from the '90s were good in spite of their gameplay, claiming that no one plays them for their \\"obtuse puzzles,\\" citing the cat mustache puzzle specifically. Anderson was critical of the puzzle particularly due to the game expecting players to don a fake mustache to impersonate someone who does not have one. Frictional Games co-founder Thomas Grip identified the puzzle as a \\"shining example\\" of what gameplay designers should not do.

It was founded by Emily Cherniack in 2013. Since its founding, New Politics has raised more than $8.5 million for their endorsed candidates and elected more than 30 of them to office, from local school boards to the U.S. Congress  History and mission  Emily Cherniack founded New Politics in 2013 to recruit and support National Service alumni and military veterans to re-enter public service through politics. Cherniack's experience working on City Year co-founder Alan Khazei‚Äôs unsuccessful bid for the 2010 U.S. Senate special election led her to conclude that the barriers to entry into politics were intentionally exclusive and dissuaded servant leaders from running.http://magazine.gwu.edu/at-your-service A City Year alum herself, Cherniack chose to focus on building a pipeline of service-oriented leaders after seeing the impact they had on communities.  2014 cycle  New Politics' first-ever recruit was Marine Corps veteran and now-Congressman, Seth Moulton. Founder Emily Cherniack called Moulton to convince him to run for Congress in his hometown district against Democratic incumbent John F. Tierney. Moulton announced his candidacy for Massachusetts' Sixth Congressional District on July 8, 2013. Moulton's campaign earned the first- ever political endorsement from retired general and Service Year Alliance Chair Stanley McChrystal. Moulton defeated Tierney in the primary with 50.8% of the vote to Tierney's 40.1% and later defeated Republican challenger Richard Tisei in November's general election.  2016 cycle  New Politics replicated the Moulton-model in 2016 when they helped elect another Marine Corps veteran, Congressman Mike Gallagher. New Politics ran Gallagher's GOTV push and raised more than $60,000 for his campaign. Gallagher won the general election for Wisconsin's Eighth Congressional District by 63 percent to become New Politics' first Republican officeholder.  2018 cycle  New Politics had their most successful cycle during the 2018 midterm elections. After a historically large crop of service veterans announced bids for federal office, New Politics partnered with Congressman Moulton to form the Serve America Victory Fund, a joint effort that sought to leverage the platform of a sitting member of Congress along with New Politics‚Äô donor network. Serve America raised more than $5 million for over 20 candidates from across the country.  2020 cycle = Service First Women's Victory Fund  In 2019, New Politics launched the Service First Women‚Äôs Victory Fund (SFWVF), a joint initiative with Representatives Chrissy Houlahan, Elaine Luria, Mikie Sherrill, Elissa Slotkin, and Abigail Spanberger. The group raised more than $650k for the five incumbent members in less than seven months.  Second Service Coalition  In February 2020, New Politics partnered with nine incumbent House members to launch the Second Service Coalition to raise funds for a slate of first-time veteran Congressional candidates.

Lashly member C consists of fining-upward cycles of medium- to fine-grained sandstone grading upward into carbonaceous siltstone and mudstone, and thin coal beds. Quartz pebbles and cobbles and mudstone clasts occur near the base of major sandstone units. Irregular lenses of coal occur along bedding planes and over large scours. Dicroidium fronds and other plant fragments are common in carbonaceous beds.Lashly Formation at Fossilworks.org  Fossil content  The following fossils have been reported from the formation:Hammer et al., 2004 * Therapsids ** Dicynodontia indet. * Reptiles ** Reptilia indet. * Flora ** Craterisporites rotundus ** Playfordiaspora crenulata ** Alisporites spp. ** Aratrisporites spp. ** Dicroidium sp. ** Uvaesporites spp.  See also  * List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Antarctica * Fremouw Formation  References = Bibliography  * * Category:Geologic formations of Antarctica Category:Triassic System of Antarctica Category:Carnian Stage Category:Sandstone formations Category:Siltstone formations Category:Mudstone formations Category:Conglomerate formations Category:Fluvial deposits Category:Paleontology in Antarctica ","title":"Lashly Formation"},{"id":"64316301","text":"Demps is a surname.

His works were shown across the United States and Europe, and are in permanent collections, notably the Solomon Guggenheim Museum, the Fondo per Arte Italiano, Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles, and the Giuseppe Panza Collection.  Life  Brewster was born in Eugene, Oregon in 1946. He spent a majority of his youth in S√£o Paulo, Brazil as an expatriate between 1950 and 1964. In high school, he became fluent in Portuguese and developed an interest in theater and set design. Brewster returned to the United States in 1964 to attend Pomona College, in Claremont, California. After graduating in 1968 with a B.A in Sculpture, he continued on to Claremont Graduate School (now Claremont Graduate University) to receive his M.F.A in 1970. Brewster taught nontraditional sculpture at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois. He moved back to the West Coast to instruct in sculpture and painting at La Verne and Pomona Colleges. In 1973, Brewster began teaching at Claremont Graduate University, where he remained for forty-one years, building the studio art program, chairing the department, and expanding the school's reputation nationally. He was awarded the first Roland Reiss Endowed Chair in Art. Brewster died on June 19, 2016, at the age of 69.  Artistic work = Lights  In the late 1960s, Brewster built a set of 25 light units he named ‚ÄúFlashers.‚Äù These were used in various outdoor installations in the Mojave Desert. Starting in the mid-1970s, he redesigned them to float in water, produced them in a larger quantity, and called them ‚ÄúFloating Flashers.‚Äù They were shown in the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, Groningen, Holland, and Gumsluk Bay, Turkey.  Sound  Brewster explained his sonic sculptures: ‚ÄúMy means is sound, especially its effects; but my issues are sculptural, not musical. Sculpture, in its most expanded sense, is the mode of experience that I find truest. I like to think about what an expanded sculptural experience could be: a full bodied bunch of sensation around being here, in the realm of the actual, the physical, in this multi-dimensional world. I‚Äôm trying to expand the sculptural experience by addressing, if not celebrating, our own existence as spatial, physical entities inhabiting all our dimensions. Sculpture should be a category of experience, not just a category of physical objects for us to stand back and behold.‚Äù\\"Where, There or Here\\" was published in \\"Site of Sound: of Architecture and the Ear,\\" edited by Brandon LaBelle and Steve Roden, Errant Bodies Press in Association with Smart Art Press, 1999 Brewster's two major bodies of works are his Acoustic Sculptures and his Sonic Drawings. Brewster describes these works as follows: \\"A typical Acoustic Sculpture is a mix of electronic tones emitted into a bare room by a single loudspeaker. The sounds echoing through each other produce a field of sound populated by places of differing loudness and tonal content. To see an Acoustic Sculpture, we must shift our sculpture viewing habits from the \\"stand and look\\" behavior to an exploratory \\"move and listen\\" approach; slowly walking our ears, instead of moving our eyes, through the elaborate spaces of \\"the room.‚Äù ‚ÄúA Sonic Drawing uses devices that emit sounds at intervals. This work relies on the coincidence of intervals to draw ‚Äòholes‚Äô in the activity, producing moments when, through a union of all elements, nothing happens.\\" Brewster conceived of Sonic Drawings in the late 1960s while attending Pomona College in Claremont.Pagel, D., & Brewster, M.

Claremont, CA, CA: Pomona College Museum of Art. He debuted them for his Master of Fine Arts Exhibition in 1969. This body of work has two forms: ‚ÄúClickers‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhistlers.‚Äù Clickers are hidden in the gallery walls while Whistlers are visible, and require the gallery visitor to activate them. The Clickers were exhibited in New York, Dallas, and were collected by Helene Winer, Pomona College, and Merry Norris, among others.http://www.michaelbrewsterart.com/uploads/1/1/8/2/118293312/see-hear- now-catalog.pdf The Acoustic Sculptures came from Brewster's study of sound waves. Learning about the phenomenon of standing waves in the early 1970s, Brewster constructed his first Acoustic Sculpture Fixed Frequency at F Space (an artist-run space in Santa Ana) in 1971. Originally, these pieces used one single tone. However, during the 1980s and 1990s, they became more complex. They began using multiple sounds and activation switches that give someone the ability to activate the piece thus making them participatory. These pieces generated scholarship by the sound theorist Brandon LaBelle and are in the permanent collection of the MOCA LA and The Guggenheim in New York.  Selected exhibitions  Throughout his career, his work was exhibited at Artists Space, New York; Galleria del Cavallino, Venice, Italy; the Marum Overpass- Kw IX A, Groningen, the Netherlands; MoMA PS1, New York; San Francisco Art Institute and the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc). Michael Brewster participated in the 1981 Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. That same year, he was a part of Art in Los Angeles: The Museum as Site, Sixteen Projects at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The following year, he collaborated with Mowry Baden at the outdoor exhibition, Artpark, in Lewiston, New York. In 1985, he was a part of New Music America, at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and COLA, at Barnsdall Municipal Gallery, Los Angeles in 1998. In 2002, ‚Äú‚ÄòSee Hear Now:‚Äô a sonic drawing and five acoustic sculptures,‚Äù a retrospective exhibition of Brewster‚Äôs work was shown at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, and in 2012, he participated in ‚ÄúIt Happened at Pomona Part 3: Pacific Standard Time‚Äù, sponsored by the Getty Foundation at Pomona College Museum of Art, Claremont, CA.

Recognition  In April 1988, Brewster was awarded the J. S. Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship. He was the recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts, Artist's Fellowship Grant in the years 1976, 1978, 1984, and 1990.

The book was intended to introduce children to both poetry and natural history, partly inspired by Anna Laetitia Barbaulds' Evenings at Home (1792‚Äì1796). Like her other educational works for children, it was primarily intended for an audience of girls, since boys would have access to formal schooling which made such books less necessary for them. Composition Smith was initially successful as a poet and then a novelist, writing sentimental and Gothic novels, but sales declined as her pro- revolutionary political opinions made her less popular. In her later years, she began writing educational works, even though publishers paid less for them, because they were less risky. Rural Walks was her first educational book, written in part to earn money for the medical care of one of her daughters, who was pregnant and ill. Smith suggested the idea of the book to her publisher, William Davies, in a letter on October 2, 1794. She had been considering writing an educational book since July 1794, and decided on the content of Rural Walks based on her difficulty finding books for her youngest daughter, who was twelve. Contents The book is framed around the story of Mrs. Woodfield and her teenage niece Caroline Cecil. Caroline has been spoiled by her upbringing in London, but when her mother dies she is sent to the countryside to be taken care of by her father's sister, Mrs. Woodfield. Mrs. Woodfield is an impoverished widow who has been seen as a stand-in for Smith herself. The book unfolds in the form of conversations between Mrs. Woodfield, her two daughters, and Caroline, as they go for walks in the countryside.

Early life Terry Whitmore was born on March 6, 1947 and grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. He graduated from high school and then enlisted in the Marines in fall of 1966. Whitmore believed that he would have been drafted anyway, and voluntarily enlisting meant he might get to stay home for one more Christmas. Military service and desertion After enlisting, Whitmore was sent overseas to fight in the Vietnam War. Though he was initially promised a non-combat role on a ship, this offer did not hold. By December 1966, he was a lance corporal and was wounded in action near Con Thien. He believed that some of the North Vietnamese combatants intentionally spared his life, instead shooting the White troops he was with. He was injured by gunfire and shrapnel, and was sent to Japan to recover. While hospitalized in Japan, he was able to watch news broadcasts from the US after the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.. Initially, he was told he would not have to return to Vietnam. The orders were changed, though, and he was scheduled to leave Japan for Vietnam. With the help of an anti-war group, he instead traveled across the USSR to Sweden, where he sought asylum. As of 1968, he was one of eighty US troops who deserted to Sweden, along with thirteen other Black troops. In Sweden, he worked as a script writer for the Swedish Film Institute. Personal life Whitmore was married before enlisting; his first child, a daughter, was born while he was overseas. Whitmore became engaged to a Swedish woman while in Sweden. While in Sweden, he joined a basketball team founded by American deserters of the Vietnam War, the Stockholm Stars. In 1977, after President Jimmy Carter signed an executive order granting amnesty to draft evaders of the Vietnam War era, Whitmore returned to the US to meet his daughter for the first time, who was being raised by his mother. He had two sons while in Sweden. Works and appearances Whitmore was one of the few Black Vietnam War veterans to write a memoir about his experience: Memphis-Nam-Sweden: The Autobiography of a Black American Exile, published in 1971. He was also the subject of the 1969 documentary Terry Whitmore, for Example, and appeared in the 2005 documentary Sir! No Sir!. Later life and death Whitmore returned to Memphis in 2001, and died in 2007. Awards and honors In 1967, he was awarded the Purple Heart by President Lyndon B. Johnson. He was also awarded the Bronze Star Medal.

He is the Democratic nominee for in the 2020 election. Bowman is the founder and former principal of the Cornerstone Academy for Social Action, a public middle school in Eastchester, Bronx. He is a member of the Lower Hudson Valley chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. He defeated 16-term incumbent Eliot Engel in the 2020 Democratic primary.  Early life and education  Bowman was born in Manhattan, New York City. He lived with his grandmother in the East River Houses in East Harlem during the week and with his mother and sisters in Yorkville, Manhattan on weekends. His grandmother died when he was eight years old. At age 16, he moved with his family to Sayreville, New Jersey. He attended Sayreville War Memorial High School, where he played on the football team. Bowman briefly attended Potomac State Junior College before earning a Bachelor of Arts in sports management from the University of New Haven in 1999. He played college football for the New Haven Chargers. Bowman later earned a Master of Arts in counseling from Mercy College and a Doctor of Education in educational leadership from Manhattanville College. Career=Education After earning his undergraduate degree, Bowman decided not to pursue a career in sports management. Upon the suggestion of a family friend who worked for the New York City Department of Education, Bowman began working as an educator. Bowman's first job was as a crisis management teacher in a South Bronx elementary school. In 2009, he founded Cornerstone Academy for Social Action, a public middle school in the Bronx. Bowman became a leading advocate against standardized testing. His blog on the role of standardized testing has received national attention. He has written about high-stakes testing's role in perpetuating inequalities, including the turnover, tumult, and vicious cycle it creates in the lives of students and educators, as assessment performance damages a school's ability to teach and, subsequently, the quality of the education upon which the student is assessed. By the mid-2010s, a quarter of Bowman's students had opted out of standardized testing. He also advocated for children to receive arts, history, and science education in addition to the basics of literacy and numeracy. Bowman's school policy used a restorative justice model to address the school-to-prison pipeline. After ten years as principal, he left the job to focus on his congressional campaign. Politics The Justice Democrats recruited Bowman to run for the United States House of Representatives in , represented by 15-term incumbent Eliot Engel, in the 2020 elections. Engel has served as a member of the House since 1989 and as the Chair of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs since the first session of the 116th United States Congress. Bowman was inspired to run by the insurgent 2018 campaign of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and described his platform as \\"anti-poverty and anti-racist\\" with support for housing, criminal justice reform, education, Medicare for All, and a Green New Deal. No Republican even filed, meaning that whoever won the Democratic primary would be essentially assured of victory in November. Registered Democrats in the district outnumber registered Republicans by more than four to one, meaning that any hypothetical Republican challenger would have faced nearly impossible odds in any case. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+24, it is the ninth-most Democratic district covering a significant portion of New York City. Bowman's campaign criticized Engel's record on foreign policy and response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bowman's endorsements from the Sunrise Movement, and New York Working Families Party assisted with fundraising despite being well behind Engel. Bowman was also endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and the editorial board of The New York Times. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large portion of ballots were cast absentee. However, because of Bowman's 26-point lead on election night, news outlets quickly started referring to him as the presumptive Democratic nominee. On July 17, 2020, based on their analysis of the absentee ballot count, the Associated Press called the primary race for Bowman. According to The New York Times, Bowman was a \\"prohibitive favorite\\" to win in November due to the 16th's heavily Democratic nature and the lack of GOP opposition.  Electoral history =2020 Democratic primary= Personal life  Bowman lives with his wife, Melissa Oppenheimer, and their three children in Yonkers, New York. Bowman is a fan of New York hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan. He described hip-hop as a \\"culture that is created by teenagers who were forgotten about, and because they were forgotten about, they were forced to come together and create something beautiful.‚Äù Bowman drew inspiration from the Wu-Tang Clan during his underdog campaign, and has frequently been seen in a Wu-Tang Clan emblazoned face covering during the COVID-19 pandemic, which GQ noted allowed Bowman to express himself, as more casual branded-clothing might not convey the gravity of an aspirant Congressman and a suit with a more conventional face covering might not separate him from the incumbent.

The residential housing association at Little Earth considers itself a united people of 39 different American Indian tribes, but the area is not an urban reservation, a common mischaracterization. Little Earth is located in the Phillips community of Minneapolis. While being a notable district, it is not one of the officially designated neighborhoods in the city.  Demographics  In the 2010s, the population of Little Earth fluctuated between 1,200 and 1,500 people, with children comprising half the total. Almost all of the households had a reported income of less than $10,000 per year. Little Earth has been described as being at the heart of Minneapolis' Native American community. American Indian people represent 7 percent of the broader Phillips area in the southern part of Minneapolis, which is also city's poorest area with 48 percent of people living in poverty.  History  Little Earth was founded in 1973 as an affordable housing project in Minneapolis. The residential community was built out in the 1970s, becoming a , 212-unit housing complex at approximately East 24th Street and Cedar Avenue in the south Minneapolis area. Beginning soon after its founding, Little Earth and the surrounding community has been at the center of the American Indian Movement. As of the 2010s, the Little Earth housing complex was the only American Indian preference, project-based Section 8 rental assistance community in the United States. The community's residential association, Little Earth of United Tribes, has filled a need for social services to residents by offering empowerment counselors, bike rentals, family therapy, tutoring, and homeownership opportunities. During the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul in May and June of 2020 community members organized safety patrol during the nights of heavy rioting, arson, and looting. Located less than from Lake Street, residents set up barricades to keep protesters from marching through the neighborhood, fearing it would result in property destruction and law enforcement actions.Burks, Megan Burks and Martinez, Kathryn Styer (27 July 2020). \\"Little Earth patrols might be a preview of a new style of policing\\". Star Tribune. The effort was credited with saving more than 20 businesses on Franklin Avenue. Residents also organized nightly safety patrols, paid for lights at a park, and trained community members in de- escalation tactics, efforts some hoped would serve as a new model for policing in the city.  Geography  The Little Earth community is located within the Phillips area of Minneapolis. On the eastern edge of the community along the Hiawatha transit corridor, the Little Earth Trail, a multi-use pedestrian and bicycle path, connects people to business and services from Franklin Avenue to East Lake Street. Several American Indian organizations are in the broader Little Earth area, such as Minneapolis American Indian Center, the Native American Community Clinic, the Native American Community Development Institute, and the Minnesota Indian Women‚Äôs Resource Center.

It is a shrub or tree usually with trifoliate leaves, white, male and female flowers arranged in panicles in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets and red, purple or brown follicles. Description Zanthoxylum ovalifolium is a shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of and often has prickles on its branchlets and thick, conical spines on its older stems. It has trifoliate leaves long, often with simple leaves on the same twig. The leaflets are elliptical to egg-shaped with the lower end towards the base, long, wide and sessile, the end leaflet sometimes on a petiolule up to long. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils, on the ends of branchlets, or both, in panicles up to long, each flower on a pedicel long. The four sepals are long and the four petals white and about long. Male flowers have four stamens long with a sterile, narrow oval carpel about high. Female flowers have a single carpel long, and sometimes rudimentary stamens. Flowering occurs in summer and the fruit is a spherical red, purple or brown follicle wide. Taxonomy Zanthoxylum ovalifolium was first formally described in 1839 by Robert Wight in his book, Illustrations of Indian Botany, from specimens collected in the \\"Shevagerry hills in flower, and fruit in August and September\\".
