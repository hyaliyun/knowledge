Pumpkin soup was a staple for the prisoners of war in North Vietnamese prison camps during the Vietnam War. Squash soup is a soup prepared using squash as a primary ingredient. Squash used to prepare the soup commonly includes acorn and butternut squash.  Preparation  Squash that has initially been separately roasted can be used in soup preparation. The roasting of squash can serve to concentrate the gourd's flavor. Squash soup can be prepared with chunks or pieces of squash and also with pur√©ed squash. Pre-cooked, frozen squash can also be used, as can commercially prepared packets of pre-cooked frozen squash pur√©e. Butternut squash soup may have a sweet flavor, due to the sugars present in the squash. Additional basic ingredients in squash soup's preparation can include broth, onion, cream, spices such as sage and thyme, salt and pepper. Pumpkin soup can be served hot or cold, and is a popular Thanksgiving dish in the United States.  History  Pumpkin \\"pies\\" made by early American colonists had more similarities to being a savory soup served in a pumpkin than a sweet custard in a crust. Pumpkin soup was a staple for the prisoners of war in North Vietnamese prison camps during the Vietnam War. Squash soup is a soup in African cuisine.

Cain (born November 28, 1948) is a Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and Director of the Bill Lane Center for the American West. Professor Cain's fields of interest include American politics, political regulation, democratic theory, and state and local government. He has written extensively on elections, legislative representation, California politics, redistricting, and political regulation. In addition to his academic work, Cain frequently is quoted in national and international media, and regularly appears as a political expert for KGO-TV in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is a member of the American Political Science Association, and serves on the editorial boards of Election Law Journal and American Politics Research. Professor Cain has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2000. During AY 2012-13, Cain will serve as a Straus Fellow at New York University's Straus Institute for the Advanced Study of Law and Justice. Education Cain graduated summa cum laude from Bowdoin College in 1970 and studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Trinity College, Oxford. In 1976, he received his Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University. Career Upon completion of his PhD, Cain began his academic career at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1976. His work as an assistant and associate professor focused on comparisons of British and American governance systems, representation and redistricting. Additionally, during his 14 years at Caltech, Cain held numerous leadership roles on academic administration committees, ranging from admissions and academic standards to the faculty board. In 1981, while on leave from the university, Cain served as a special consultant to the California Assembly Special Committee on Reapportionment. Working with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Cain's work on California's redistricting was the first effort to employ satellite maps and computer programming in the apportionment process prior to the creation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). His work in the early 1980s ultimately led to the creation of the statewide database. This public data enterprise is now housed under the Berkeley School of Law, and continues to be the primary warehouse for redistricting information and data in California. In 1989, Cain joined the faculty of what is now named The Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science at University of California at Berkeley. From 1995 to 2006, Cain was appointed the Robson Professor of Political Science, and served as the Heller Professor of Political Science from 2007-2012. Under the direction of Nelson W. Polsby, Cain served as the Associate Director of the Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) from 1989-1999 and as its Director from 1999-2007. The IGS is an interdisciplinary organized research unit (ORU) at UC Berkeley. Founded in 1919, IGS and its affiliated centers spearhead and promote research, programs, seminars and colloquia, training, educational activities, and public service in the fields of politics and public policy, with a strong focus on national and California politics. Between September 2005 - June 2012, Cain served as the Executive Director of the University of California's Washington Center, ‚Äúa multi-campus residential, instructional and research center that provides students and faculty from the University of California with opportunities to research, work, study and live within rich cultural, political and international heritage of our capital city.‚Äù In addition to his administrative duties as director, Professor Cain taught undergraduate seminars on the Congress, political reform and research methodology. Contributions to Political Science Bruce Cain was one of early contributors to the now burgeoning field of Election Law and Political Regulation. Since Baker v Carr (1962), the courts have been drawn into deciding disputes over political reforms related to redistricting, term limits, party primaries, campaign finance, direct democracy and election administration. Many of Cain's empirical studies show that political reforms rarely achieve all that they promise because of adaptive behavior by those being regulated and because there is typically more consensus about the problems than the solutions. His work has demonstrated that terms limits, for instance, have not reduced partisanship or increased the quality of state legislatures, that redistricting reform has been frustrated by the inability to define what fairness is, and that campaign finance regulation is hindered by being necessarily ex post facto. His most recent studies have focused on devising a more realistic and coherent theory of political reform. Awards Throughout his career, Cain has been recognized for not only his distinguished research, but also for his commitment to mentoring both undergraduate and graduate students. In 1988, he was a co-winner of the Richard F. Fenno Prize for the best legislative studies book along with J. A. Ferejohn and M. Fiorina. In 1988, he received the Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology Award for Excellence in Teaching. In 2000, Stanford University awarded him the Zale Award for Outstanding Achievement in Policy Research and Public Service. In 2003, UC Berkeley recognized Professor Cain for Distinguished Mentoring of Undergraduates. Also in 2003, the American Political Science Association and Pi Sigma Alpha, the National Political Science Honor Society, honored Cain for outstanding teaching in political science. Media Beginning in 1984, Cain has been an election commentator for every race in California both on the radio and on television. He served as a consultant to the Los Angeles Times from 1986‚Äì88 and was the political analyst on Mornings on Two, KTVU from 1998-2006. He is a member of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and currently appears as a regular political analyst for KGO-TV. Government and Political Consulting He served as a polling consultant for state and senate races to Fairbank, Canapary and Maulin from 1985 to 1986. Cain's expertise has led him to work as a redistricting consultant to several government agencies, including: the Los Angeles City Council (1986), Los Angeles County (1991), the Oakland City Council (1993), the City of San Diego (2001), the City and County of San Francisco (2002), the Attorney General of Maryland (2011), the Attorney General of Massachusetts (1987‚Äì88), and the U.S. Justice Department (1989). He served as the Special Master to the three judge panel overseeing the Arizona State Legislative Redistricting (2002).

The late generations are smaller and the wingspan has an average of 16‚Äì26 mm. These moths are easily distinguishable from the mahogany or pink stripe, located on yellowish or cream background, crossing diagonally the dorsal sides of the upperwings from the posterior margin up to the apex. Discal spots are usually present and have the same colour as the postmedial line. The dorsal sides of the hindwings are whitish and unmarked. The fringes on the wings are mostly in the basic colour. The abdomen is pure white. Head and thorax are straw yellow. In males the antennae are bipectinated to three-fourths length.

Biology Caterpillar on a leaf of Rumex crispus Usually these moths rest with a tent-like posture on twigs and herbs, with the wings parallel to each other. They fly from April to October in the Northern Hemisphere. They are nocturnal, attracted to light and migrant. These moths breed in North Africa and in southern Europe, since they require constant warmth. The eggs are relatively long, yellowish, with distinct red spots. The caterpillars mimic twigs and therefore they are quite difficult to locate. They are slender and reach a length of about 25 millimetres. The basic colour is pale brown or green, with a whitish underside. The green forms usually show a dark brown or reddish irregular stripe on the back. The head is reddish brown and relatively small. These caterpillars feed on knotgrass, dock, Anthemis, Emex, Oxygonum, Persicaria, Rhus and other low growing plants. The pupa can reach a length of 9.2 mm and a diameter of about 2.7 mm. It is yellowish brown coloured, with dark spots. Notes #The flight season refers to the Belgium and the Netherlands. This may vary in other parts of the range.

St Mary's Church :: In 1880 the Malankara Church acquired of land for construction of the church and a cornerstone was laid in 1889. The church began as a small building thatched with coconut leaves which was slowly built out in the early 1900s. Paulose Mar Athanasius built the current St Mary's Church in the early 1930s.

Like the newer church building, the seminary was finished and opened by Mar Athanasius in 1930‚Äì31. A dormitory for seminary students called the Syrian Hostel was also built nearby. In the spring of 1931 Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Elias III began a long journey of mediation throughout India by staying at the new seminary, after first calling on British officials Lord Irwin in Delhi and George Stanley at Madras.

Life His education began at home, and after his family moved to Deerfield, New York, U.S.A., continued in the union school of that place, and subsequently in the Christian Brothers' Academy at Utica. Believing himself called to the life of a religious teacher, he entered the novitiate of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, in New York City, on 24 February 1862. He taught in Albany, New York City, and Philadelphia until 1866, when he was called to the professorship of mathematics and literature in Rock Hill College, Ellicott City, Maryland. Gradually his interests were absorbed by literature and philosophy, which, with pedagogy, continued to hold them until the end of his career. From 1879 to 1886 he was President of Rock Hill College. Then followed two years of research in European libraries, chiefly those of Paris and London. On his return to the United States, he became professor of literature in De La Salle Institute, New York City, and remained such till his death at the Catholic Summer School, Plattsburgh, 20 August 1893. Works He was a frequent contributor to the Catholic World, the American Catholic Quarterly Review, and the American Ecclesiastical Review, and his name appears in the files of the Educational Review and of the International Journal of Ethics. His lectures include:-\\"The Psychological Aspects of Educations\\", delivered before the Regent's Convocation, University of the State of New York, 1877; \\"Literary and Scientific Habits of Thought\\", before the International Congress of Education, 1884; \\"Aristotle and the Christian Church\\", before the Concord School of Philosophy, 1885; \\"Church and State\\", before the Farmington School of Philosophy, 1890; \\"Religion in Education\\", before the New York State Teachers' Association, 1891; \\"Educational Epochs\\", before the Catholic Summer School, 1893. At the time of his death, he was engaged in preparing a History of Education for the International Education Series. His first work as an independent author appeared in 1874, with the title An Essay Contributing to a Philosophy of Literature (seventh edition, 1899). Ernest Renan and Ralph Waldo Emerson had attempted to make literature a substitute for religion in cultured circles; Brother Azarias claims in this essay that literature draws its life and excellence from religion. The Development of Old English Thought (third edition, 1903) appeared in 1879 as the first part of a projected course in English literature, which, however, was never completed. The author begins with sketching the \\"continental homestead\\" which was written for the \\"Ave Maria\\". After his death many of this contributions to reviews were gathered and published in three volumes, viz. Essays Educational, Essays philosophical, and Essays Miscellaneous (1896). of the English; he then contrasts the Celt and Teuton, examines the pagan traditions on which Christian literature was engrafted, and concludes with pen pictures of Hilda, Caedmon, Benedict Biscop, and the Venerable Bede. The period covered is the first thousand years of the Christian era. Aristotle and the Christian Church (London and New York, 1888) sets forth the attitude of the Catholic Church towards Aristotelean philosophy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Books and Reading (seventh edition, New York, 1904) was originally a reprint of two lectures delivered before the Cathedral Library Reading Circle of New York City, 1899). It attempts to make literature in general, and Catholic literature in particular, a living force for those even who have not received the benefits of higher education. Phases of Thought and Criticism (1892) contrasts first Cardinal Newman and Emerson as typical thinkers, and then the \\"habits of thought engendered by literary pursuits and those begotten of scientific studies.\\" His minor works include Mary, Queen of May, The first of these includes the lectures delivered at the Catholic Summer School, just before his death; the second reprints the lecture on \\"Aristotle and the Christian Church\\", adding \\"Nature and Synthetic Principle of Philosophy\\", the \\"Symbolism of the Cosmos\\", \\"Psychological Aspects of Education\\" and \\"Ethical Aspects of the Papal Encyclical on Capital and Labor\\".

Henry first published in The Cosmopolitan Magazine, April 1903. It describes the events which lead up to the reformation of an ex-convict. In 1910, dramatist Paul Armstrong adapted the story into a highly successful Broadway play under the title Alias Jimmy Valentine which ran 155 performances at Wallack's Theatre in New York, and the play was subsequently made into three film versions: one in 1915 directed by Maurice Tourneur and starring Robert Warwick, one in 1920 directed by Edmund Mortimer and starring Bert Lytell, and one in 1928 directed by Jack Conway and starring William Haines, the last being Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer's first sound film with dialogue sequences. The popularity of the story as a motion picture added greatly to the author's vogue, though in the English, French, and Spanish versions O. Henry's name was not mentioned. The character of Jimmy Valentine is taken from life but there is a close parallel to the leading incident in chapter XLII of Hugo's Les Miserables. The story was adapted into a radio series, Alias Jimmy Valentine, that was broadcast from 1938 to 1939. Synopsis Safecracker Jimmy Valentine was released from prison after serving less than ten months of a four year sentence, due to his criminal connections. He goes to his old apartment, packs up his tools, and leaves. In the following weeks, a few cash robberies are committed, and the detective who landed Valentine in jail in the first place, Ben Price, is called to work on the new case. He realizes that the robberies are committed in Jimmy's style. Valentine shows up sometime later in Elmore, Arkansas. He goes to the town bank with the intention of checking it over before robbing it. However, as he walks to the hotel, he catches the eye of the banker's beautiful daughter, Annabel Adams. He falls in love with her immediately and instantly decides to give up his criminal career. He moves into the town, taking up the identity of Ralph D. Spencer, a shoemaker: he had been assigned shoemaking as forced labor in prison. At the end of the year, Jimmy has risen socially and in business and has become engaged to Annabel. Two weeks before the wedding, he writes a letter to a friend, telling the friend to pick up the safe-cracker's tools that Valentine will not need anymore. By this time, Price has tracked him down and shows up at the bank while Jimmy and Annabel's family are inside. Carrying the tool case, Jimmy watches as Annabel's father shows them the bank's new safe. Annabel's nieces are fascinated by it, and as they are playing, one accidentally shuts the other inside and locks the door, without the time lock's clock having been wound nor any combination set. Everyone panics, and Annabel begs Jimmy to do something. Jimmy, knowing that it will reveal his true identity, uses his case of tools to open the door and save the child. Unbeknownst to Valentine at that time, Price has witnessed the whole incident. Valentine starts to leave the bank afterwards, and he sees Price standing by the door. Sheepishly, he gives himself up, but much to his surprise, Price pretends not to recognize him and walks away.

The Academia Europaea is an independent learned society and European Union's Academy of Humanities and Sciences. On the initiative of Royal Society and other National Academies in Europe, the Academia was founded in 1988 as the functioning Europe-wide Academy that encompasses all fields of scholarly inquiry. 2) Order of Australia, Companion to the Queen (AC) 2016. This is Australia's highest civilian honour, similar to UK knighthood. To appreciate this requires a trip to Wikipedia: Of the approximately 400 over the 50 years of the Australian national honours system, over all walks of life (politicians, sports stars, movie stars...) there have been approximately 60 AC academics, of which there are approximately 30 scientists, and of those, 6 Nobel Laureates. I am the first computer scientist to receive this honour. 3) Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand (HFRSNZ) 2014. He is the second person whose primary research area is algorithms to receive this honor. Honorary Fellows include Einstein, Bohr, Curie, Darwin, Fleming, Priestley, Richter, Rutherford, altogether 230 since 1870. 4) EATCS Fellow 2014. Mike has been conferred one of the inaugural first 10 EATCS Fellows for \\"his role in founding the field of parameterized complexity theory, which has become a major subfield of research in theoretical computer science, and for being a leader in computer science education\\". 5) EATCS-NERODE Prize 2014. This award at ALGO/ESA and is for a series of papers on how to establish lower bounds on kernelization. The two papers and prize winners are: On problems without polynomial kernels, Hans Bodlaender, Rodney Downey, Michael Fellows, Danny Hermelin. Journal of Computer and System Sciences 2009. Infeasibility of instance compression and succinct PCPs for NP, Lance Fortnow, Rahul Santhanam, same journal 2011. 6) ABZ International Medal of Honor for Fundamental Contributions to Computer Science Education. This award through ETH-Zurich is for Mike's outreach to kids and the community. Fellows wrote Computer Science Unplugged! (www.csunplugged.org with New Zealand colleagues Tim Bell (University of Canterbury, NZ) and Ian Witten (Otago University, NZ). activities are the basis of workshops sponsored by Google across the world. They are used in codeweek.au and in curriculum in UK. The book has been translated into 19 languages. It is a global grass-roots movement. Mike and Frances Rosamond give workshops to Aboriginal schools in Australia, India and around the world. Professor Fellow says, ‚ÄúThe activities are based on modern research in computer science and mathematics. These materials can be used to make early education more exciting and engaging,‚Äù Woven through Computer Science Unplugged is the importance of story: that presenting math and computing topics through story-telling and drama can captivate children and adults alike, and provides a whole new level of engagement. Mike's activities are about thinking outside the box, whether sharing the unknowns of computer science and mathematics with elementary school children or running a mathematics event in a park.‚Äù Mike has been an Australian Professorial Fellow at the University of Newcastle, Australia and at Charles Darwin University, Australia. He is Visiting Professor at Royal Holloway University of London. In 2006, he was an inaugural Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Study, Durham University, and at that time a Best Fellow of Grey College. In 2007, Mike received an Alexander von Humboldt Research Award. He collaborates extensively around the world.  Computer Science Unplugged!  Fellow's books Computer Science Unplugged!Computer Science Unplugged! website written with Tim Bell and Ian Witten, and This is MEGA-Mathematics!,This is MEGA-Mathematics! with Nancy Casey convey sophisticated concepts such as intractability, sorting networks, and cryptography. They have won several science popularization awards, and been translated into languages including Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, and German, with more translations underway. Unplugged! was part of the famous British Faraday Christmas Lectures in 2008, which was given by Professor Christopher M. BishopProfessor Christopher M. Bishop of UK Microsoft Research.

He set up his own company, Premier Productions, and made the film in association with R. J. Minney and Leslie Arliss who had all collaborated on The Wicked Lady. Filing started in August 1947. It was shot at MGM's British studios. The cast includes Australian Patti Morgan, who Ostrer put under a seven-year contract. Reception=Critical Reviews were very bad. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \\"the film is over-exaggerated in every detail and will appeal only to the very unsophisticated.\\" Variety said Ostrer \\"forgot that recent successful mellers leaned on stars for clicks with this 'first independent production. He boasts that the team that made his \\"Wicked Lady\\" has turned out this picture, but he has no James Mason and no Margaret Lockwood to carry the burden of an ill- written, corny script., Instead, he has comparative newcomers, who unfortunately do not merit leads in an ambitious picture. Its boxoffice prospects are dim. It would be a waste to export it to America.\\"Review of Idol of Paris at Variety Box Office The movie was not a financial success and led to Maurice Ostrer quitting the film business for good. He cancelled plans to make a film Wild Marriage and dropped eight artists who he had under contract.

Eupatorium paludicola and Eupatorium novae-angliae  Eupatorium paludicola consists of diploids from clay soils of North Carolina and South Carolina. Until the early 21st century, they were classified in E. leucolepis. Eupatorium novae-angliae, known from a dozen or so sites in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, is a hybrid- derived allopolyploid of Eupatorium paludicola and Eupatorium perfoliatum. In the past it was known as E. leucolepis var. novae-angliae but, like E. paludicola, it does not appear to be closely related to E. leucolepis. It is self-sustaining, rather than being found only where both parents are present, so various authors since 1992 have proposed treating it as a distinct species.

In the North of Europe it is found up to Central Fennoscandia, in the South to Italy to the Balkans and the Black Sea. Description The wingspan is 34‚Äì38 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is creamy white to bright white. The basal field is markedly black-brown in colour. There is a large black-brown on the front edge behind the middle and almost to the apex. There is a double crossline of dark grey colour and a white wavy line in the grey marginal field, Very small black discal flecks are also present. The hindwings are white, have a grey marginal field that is crossed by a faint whitish squiggle and there is a thin, dark cross line and a small black middle spot. Biology The moth is single brooded and flies from mid May to mid August. The larva feeds on bramble, raspberry and strawberry and in the UK can be found from July to September.

The Kingdom of Bhutan is a small, landlocked nation nestled in the southern slopes of the Eastern Himalaya. To its north lies the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and to the west, south and east lies the Indian states of Sikkim, Bengal, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The terrain is some of the most rugged in the world, characterised by huge variations in altitude. Within the 150 miles between the southern and northern borders, Bhutan's elevation rises from 150 to more than 7,500 metres. This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to Bhutan's outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems. The tiger, one-horned rhino, golden langur, clouded leopard, hispid hare and the sloth bear live in the lush tropical lowland and hardwood forests in the south. In the temperate zone, grey langur, tiger, common leopard, goral and serow are found in mixed conifer, broadleaf and pine forests. Fruit bearing trees and bamboo provide habitat for the Himalayan black bear, red panda, squirrel, sambar, wild pig and barking deer. The alpine habitats of the great Himalayan range in the north are home to the snow leopard, blue sheep, marmot, antelope and Himalayan musk deer. Flora and birds abound with more than 770 species of bird and 5,400 species of plants known to occur throughout the kingdom.  Conservation significance  The Eastern Himalayas have been identified as a global biodiversity hotspot and counted among the 234 globally outstanding ecoregions of the world in a comprehensive analysis of global biodiversity undertaken by WWF between 2009-2021. Bhutan is seen as a model for proactive conservation initiatives. The Kingdom has received international acclaim for its commitment to the maintenance of its biodiversity. This is reflected in the decision to maintain at least 12 of the land area under forest cover, to designate more than a quarter of its territory as national parks, reserves and other protected areas, and most recently to identify a further nine percent of land area as biodiversity corridors linking the protected areas. Environmental conservation has been placed at the core of the nation's development strategy, the middle path. It is not treated as a sector but rather as a set of concerns that must be mainstreamed in Bhutan's overall approach to development planning and to be buttressed by the force of law.  Conservation issues  The most endangered Asia top predator of 2010, the dhole is on edge of extinction. There remain less than 2500 members of this species in the world. Although Bhutan's natural heritage is still largely intact, the Government has rightly recognised that it cannot be taken for granted and that conservation of the natural environment must be considered one of the challenges that will need to be addressed in the years ahead. Pressures on the natural environment are already evident and will be fuelled by a complex array of forces. They include population pressures, agricultural modernisation, poaching, large-scale hydro-power development, mineral extraction, industrialisation, urbanisation, sewage and waste disposal, tourism, competition for available land road construction and the provision of other physical infrastructure associated with social and economic development. Policy implementation needs to be continually improved. Sustainable rural livelihoods that do not rely solely upon natural resource use need to be developed and supported, and there needs to be far wider understanding of the environmental threats that come hand in hand with development, to ensure the future of Bhutan's rich and diverse environment.

Life  Levashev was sent by Russian Empress Catherine II, as main assistant of expedition leader Krenitzin, to explore the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean and particularly the area around the Bering strait on four ships. Levashev was the commander of ship St. Paul, while Krenitzin was in command of the St. Catherine.COXE, William. Account of the Russian Discoveries Between Asia and America. Krenitzin and Levashev surveyed the eastern part of the Aleutian island chain. In 1768-69 Levashef wintered in a natural harbor in Unalaska. The following year, after resuming their explorations, both ships wintered in Kamchatka. Certain geographic features of the Alaskan coast, like Avatanak and Akutan Island were named by Krenitzin and Levashev in the maps that were subsequently published. On 4 July 1770, when Krenitzin drowned, Levashef assumed command of the Russian expedition fleet and returned to St. Petersburg, where he arrived on 22 October 1771.

More commonly found in Britain, miners' institutes were owned by miner groups who gave a proportion of their wage into a communal fund to pay for the construction and running of the building. The institutes would normally contain a library, reading room and meeting room. Miners' institutes of North and South Wales Oakdale Institute at St Fagans National History Museum During the late 19th century, with the population growth seen in former rural communities, many industrialised areas saw workers contributing to funds to build institutes. This was typified in the southern coalfield of Wales, which by 1910 saw institutes built in most towns and villages.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg558 The institutes were of socialist and altruistic nature and would include small libraries and reading rooms, whose books would lean towards history and politics, in an attempt to allow the working class man to better himself. Aneurin Bevan attributed his intellectual training to the Tredegar miners' library. While the library and reading room took care of the intellectual needs of the population the larger institutes often catered for the social side by providing a billiards hall, a refreshment room, and a large hall which could be used for meetings or entertainment. The 'Stute, as it was popularly known, soon became the heart of the community. The institutes were normally run by committee chosen by the workers, and a nominal fee was required from members to pay for the running costs, though some philanthropic coalowners would financially support the local institute. Following the Royal Commission for Coal in 1919, a Miners' Welfare Fund was established to provide amenities for the miners, such as communal baths, scholarships and welfare halls. This in turn led to the construction of welfare halls in the areas which to this date had no miners' institutes. By the eve of the Second World War there were more than a hundred miners' institutes, those of note include 'Y Stiwt' in Rhosllannerchrugog, the Oakdale Miners' Institute, the Parc and Dare in the Rhondda and the Abercynon Miners' Institute. Most of the institutes survived into the 1970s but with the decline of coal many of the buildings were left to ruin. Slowly returning prosperity to former mining communities has witnessed a revival of some of the institutes, such as those at Blackwood, Llanhilleth and Newbridge, which have rebranded themselves as entertainment or arts centres. The South Wales Miners' Library in Swansea keeps many of the collections from the institutes intact, and the Oakdale Institute has been reconstructed at St Fagans National History Museum.

The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1794. It is common in continental Europe and adjacent lands, though in the northeast, its range does not significantly extend beyond the Baltic region and it is absent from northern Russia. This well-flying species is somewhat prone to vagrancy and able to cross considerable distances of open sea; it can thus be regularly found on the British Isles (though mainly in the south) and even on Iceland.FE (2009), Kimber [2010] Under its junior synonyms Nycterosea brunneipennis and Geometra fluviata, the gem is the type species of genera Nycterosea and Percnoptilota, respectively. The latter is treated as junior synonym of the former, but Nycterosea, though usually included in Orthonama these days, may warrant recognition as an independent genus after all.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004ab) Description and ecology Male at Goes in the Netherlands The adult's wingspan is 18‚Äì21 mm; in their core range (e.g. Belgium and the Netherlands) they can be seen between April and November, but in outlying regions they may only be regularly encountered in late summer and early autumn, when vagrant individuals abound. This species is strongly sexually dimorphic: Males are light brown with a wavy pattern of whitish lines and a broad darker band running across the wings, forming concentric semicircles when the moth is at rest. There is a small whitish-rimmed black spot within the darker band between the centre and the leading edge of each forewing. The females are slightly larger and much darker, almost uniformly blackish brown with an indistinct lighter pattern and a forewing spot like the males have.Kolar (1942), Kimber [2010] The caterpillar larvae feed on a wide range of low-growing core eudicots, but prefer asterids. Host plants recorded from the Central European part of its range include:Kimber [2010], and see references in Savela (2001) Euasterids I * Gentianales: Rubiaceae ** Galium (bedstraws) * Solanales: Convolvulaceae ** Convolvulus (true bindweeds) Euasterids II * Asterales: Asteraceae ** Anthemis (dog-fennels) ** Chrysanthemum (chrysanthemums) ** Eupatorium (bonesets) ** Senecio (ragworts and groundsels) - e.g. common groundsel (S. vulgaris) in the British Isles Eurosids II * Brassicales: Brassicaceae ** Alyssum (alyssums) ** Nasturtium (watercresses) Basal core eudicots * Caryophyllales: Polygonaceae ** Polygonum (knotweed) ** Rumex (docks and sorrels) Synonyms The widespread, strongly sexually dimorphic and somewhat phenotypically variable gem has been described anew time and again by various authors, even as late as the early 20th century, but all these supposedly distinct taxa are nowadays considered to refer to a single species.

Life  Krenitsyn and Levashev surveyed the eastern part of the Aleutian island chain until the cold weather set in. Krenitsyn wintered in the strait between Unimak and the Alaska Peninsula. The following year, after resuming their surveys, both ships wintered in Kamchatka. Certain geographic features of the Alaskan coast, like Avatanak, Akutan and Tigalda Island were named by Krenitsyn in the maps that were subsequently published. On July 4, 1770, Krenitsyn drowned in the Kamchatka River and Levashev assumed command of the Russian expeditionary fleet.

This diverse composition of the country's fauna is associated with its location in the transitional zone between two major zoogeographical regions, the Palearctic, and the Oriental. Habitats=Northern highlands and plains The northern highlands include lower elevation areas of Potohar and Azad Jammu and Kashmir regions and higher elevation areas embracing the foothills of Himalayan, Karakorum and Hindukush mountain ranges. These areas provide an excellent habitat for wildlife in the form of alpine grazing lands, sub-alpine scrub and temperate forests. The areas are difficult for human beings to access, hence, most wildlife is present in reasonable numbers though some are endangered for other reasons. The northern highlands of Pakistan are covered with conifer and scrub forests, which have been reduced to scanty growth in most places. This biome is defined as northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. Some of the wildlife species found in northern mountainous areas and Pothohar Plateau include the bharal, Eurasian lynx, Himalayan goral, Marco Polo sheep, marmot (in Deosai National Park) and yellow-throated marten and birds species of chukar partridge, Eurasian eagle-owl, Himalayan monal and Himalayan snowcock and amphibian species of Himalayan toad and Muree Hills frog. Threatened species include the snow leopard, Himalayan brown bear, Indian wolf, Rhesus macaque, Markhor, Siberian ibex, white-bellied musk deer. Bird species present are cheer pheasant, peregrine falcon and western tragopan.Raja, N. A; P. Davidson, et al. (1999). \\"The birds of Palas, North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan\\". Forktail 15: 77‚Äì85. Indus plains and deserts of Sindh River Indus and its numerous eastern tributaries of Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, Jhelum, Beas are spread across most of Punjab. The plain of river Indus continues towards and occupy most of western Sindh. The plains have many fluvial landforms (including bars, flood plains, levees, meanders and ox-bows) that support various natural biomes including tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forestry as well as tropical and xeric shrublands (deserts of Thal and Cholistan in Punjab, Nara and Thar in Sindh). The banks and stream beds of the river system also support riparian woodlands that exhibit the tree species of kikar, mulberry and sheesham. The reed beds and tamarisk bushes along the rivers are also present. Such geographical landforms accompanied by an excellent system of monsoon climate provides an excellent ground for diversity of flora and fauna species. However, the plains are equally appealing to humans for agricultural goals and development of civilization. Vast Indus flood plains have been cleared of natural vegetation to grow crops. This has caused only a few species to become endangered. Some of the non-threatened mammal species includes the nilgai, red fox and wild boar, bird species of Alexandrine parakeet, barn owl, black kite, myna, hoopoe, Indian peafowl, Indian leopard, red-vented bulbul, rock pigeon, shelduck and shikra, reptile species of Indian cobra, Indian star tortoise, Sindh krait and yellow monitor and amphibian species of Indus Valley bullfrog and Indus Valley toad. Some of the threatened mammal species include the, axis deer, blackbuck (in captivity; extinct in wild), hog deer, dholes, Indian pangolin, Punjab urial and Sindh ibex, bird species of white-backed vulture and reptile species of black pond turtle and gharial. Grey partridge is one of the few birds that can be found in the Cholistan desert. The Tharparkar desert supports a fair population of the Chinkara. Wild boar numbers have increased because of the immunity they enjoy in a Muslim society that forbids its consumption by humans. Mugger crocodiles inhabit the Deh Akro-II Desert Wetland Complex, Nara Desert Wildlife Sanctuary, Chotiari Reservoir and Haleji Lake. Western highlands, plains and deserts Goitered Gazelle Western region of Pakistan, most of which is enveloped in Balochistan province, has a complex geography. In mountainous highlands, habitat varies from conifer forests of deodar in Waziristan and juniper in Ziarat. Numerous mountain ranges surround the huge lowland plains of Balochistani Plateau, through which a rather intricate meshwork of seasonal rivers and salt pans is spread. Deserts are also present, showing xeric shrubland vegetation in the region. Date palms and ephedra are common flora varieties in the desert. The Balochistan leopard has been described from this region. Some of the mammal species include the caracal, Balochistan dormouse, Blanford's fox, dromedary camel, goitered gazelle, Indian crested porcupine, long-eared hedgehog, markhor, ratel, and striped hyena, bird species of bearded vulture, houbara bustard and merlin, reptile species of leopard gecko and saw-scaled viper and amphibian species of Balochistan toad. Wetlands, coastal regions and marine life Indus River Dolphin, national aquatic marine mammal of Pakistan There are a number of protected wetlands (under Ramsar Convention) in Pakistan. These include Tanda dam and Thanedar Wala in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Chashma barrage, Taunsa barrage and Uchhali complex in Punjab, Haleji lake, Hub dam and Kinjhar lake in Sindh, Miani Hor in Balochistan. The wetlands are a habitat for migratory birds such as dalmatian pelicans and demoiselle crane as well as predatory species of osprey, common kingfisher, fishing cat and leopard cat near the coast line. Chashma and Taunsa Barrage Dolphin Sanctuary protects the threatened species of Indus river dolphins which tend to live in freshwater. The coastline of Pakistan is 1,050 km long and consists of a variety of habitat types, supporting a wide range of animals, of which over 1000 are fish species in the reefs of its continental shelf. The east half of the coast of Pakistan is located in the south of Sindh province which features Indus River Delta and coast of Great Rann of Kutch. The largest saltwater wetland in Pakistan is the Indus River Delta. Unlike many other river deltas, it consists of clay soil and is very swampy. West coast of Great Rann of Kutch, east to the Indus River Delta and below Tharparkar desert, is one of the few places where greater flamingos come to breed. It is also a habitat for endangered species of lesser florican. Unlike Indus River Delta, this part of the coast is not as swampy and exhibits shrubland vegetation of rather dry thorny shrubs as well as marsh grasses of Apluda and Cenchrus. The vegetation of Indus River Delta is mainly represented by various mangrove species and bamboo species. The Indus River Delta-Arabian Sea mangroves is a focused ecoregion of WWF. Nearly 95% of the mangroves located in the Indus River Delta are of the species Avicennia marina. Very small patches of Ceriops roxburghiana and Aegicerias corniculata are found. These provide nesting grounds for common snakehead, giant snakehead, Indus baril and many species of catfish like rita. The hilsa swims up from the Arabian Sea to spawn in freshwater. Species that are important to people as food, such as the golden mahseer and large freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium species), are part of the abundant aquatic life. The west half of the Pakistan coast is in the south of Balochistan province. It is also called the Makran coast and exhibits protected sites such as Astola Island and Hingol National Park. The three major mangrove plantations of Balochistan coast are Miani Hor, Kalmat Khor and Gwatar Bay. Miani Hor is a swampy lagoon on the coast in the Lasbela district where the climate is very arid. The sources of fresh water for Miani Hor are the seasonal river of Porali. The nearest river to the other lagoon, Kalmat Khor, is the Basol River. Gawatar, the third site, is an open bay with a mouth almost as wide as its length. Its freshwater source is the Dasht River, the largest seasonal river of Baluchistan. All three bays support mainly A. marina species of mangrove. Pakistan also plans to rehabilitate mangrove-degraded areas at Sonmiani and Jiwani in Balochistan. Along the shores of Astola and Ormara beaches of Balochistan and Hawk'e Bay and Sandspit beaches of Sindh are nesting sites for five endangered species of sea turtles: green sea, loggerhead, hawksbill, olive ridley and leatherback. Sea snakes such as yellow-bellied sea snake are also found in the pelagic zone of the sea. The wetlands of Pakistan are also a home to the mugger crocodile who prefer freshwater habitat.

The screenplay was written by Laura Jones and Abi Morgan. The Indian actress Tannishtha Chatterjee played the lead role of Nazneen. The film had its first public screening at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States. Plot The movie largely takes place in London following the 9/11 attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda, and reflects a period of heightened racial tensions in Britain as well. The film tells the story of Nazneen, who has grown up in rural Bangladesh, in the district of Mymensingh.Book Review: Brick Lane SAWNET Nazneen has a sister, but when she is still young, her mother drowns herself because she can not handle the hardship of life in the village. Their father marries Nazneen, elder of the two girls, to a middle-aged but educated man, Chanu, who lives in London. Nazneen leaves behind her sister and her family home in Bangladesh when Chanu takes her back to the United Kingdom. They live in a small flat on Brick Lane, the centre of the British Bengali community, and Nazneen herself has two daughters. Married to a man she does not love, Nazneen lives vicariously through the letters she receives from her sister about her carefree life and love affairs. The film picks up the story after Nazneen and her husband have lived in the small flat for 17 years, raising two daughters. It is not pleasant. Her first child, a son, died as a baby in his cot. Brick Lane is harassed by bigoted people handing out flyers that fan irrational fears of Muslim extremists taking over the streets of London. The flat is small and cramped. Her only resources are for groceries to feed her now teenaged daughters and her husband. She misses her sister and yearns to get back home. Nazneen does not love her husband but is submissive to him for the sake of peace and her two children. Then her husband resigns from his job from what he sees as unappreciation for his skills and talents. Nazneen gets a sewing machine from a neighbor to earn money mending jeans for a pound a piece. She then meets Karim, who delivers clothes to her for work. The Bangladeshi Muslim community in London is increasingly religious in nature, and this is reflected in the character of Karim. Nazneen becomes filled with desire for the young, good-looking Karim who visits her regularly, and they have an affair. In the meantime, her husband borrows money from a loan shark who has a reputation for always coming back for more money. Nazneen attends a Muslim ‚ÄúUnite‚Äù program during which they decide to call themselves the Bengal Tigers. Later, more sparks fly between her and Karim and he takes her to his uncle‚Äôs factory and they kiss. She begins to have an affair with Karim Finally Nazneen makes the connection that her sister is prostituting herself to get money; that is why she describes all these illicit affairs. Nazneen has an emotional breakdown during this time and she is put in bed to sleep. Chanu begins to pack up as Nazneen recovers. He also gets tickets for their trip back to Bangladesh. Meanwhile Karim goes away to see his family in another town; he then comes back to visit her, and tells her he turned down marriage with another girl for Nazneen. Their conversation is interrupted by Nazneen‚Äôs elder daughter. Her daughter questions Nazneen‚Äôs relationship with Karim. A woman representing the loan sharks harasses Nazneen for more money that is supposedly owed. Her daughters voice their displeasure about leaving to Bangladesh. She confronts her husband about the debt he owes the loan sharks which he brushes off. Chanu and Nazneen attend a Muslim rally in a town hall and Chanu berates the cause of the gathering but they rebuff his statements. Nazneen informs Karim that she does not want to marry him because she is ‚Äúno longer the girl from the village.‚Äù Karim leaves broken-hearted and in tears. Nazneen tells the loan shark off, saying she has overpaid the debt her husband owes, and the lady leaves after she refuses to swear on the Quran that they owe more. Their eldest daughter confronts both Chanu and Nazneen about her own desire to stay in London. She then runs off into the streets while a festival is ongoing as her mother runs after her. Nazneen catches up to her at the train station. Chanu and Nazneen share a heart to heart about staying and leaving. Despite always longing for her 'home,' Nazneen realizes her home is where her children are happy. Chanu decides that he will leave and that they will follow him at a later date. Casting and production Tannishtha Chatterjee was the first actress who auditioned for the role of Nazneen. Two months after her initial audition, after Gavron had seen several hundred women, Gavron hired her. Both Christopher Simpson, who played Karim, and Chatterjee studied the Bangladeshi culture in Brick Lane by following around locals. Satish Kaushik was cast after Gavron saw a picture of him on the Internet. Since Brick Lane was his first English-language film, he took lessons from a diction coach to improve his accent. Many residents of Brick Lane were hired as extras to appear on the film, and some members of crew were hired from the local area. The film's winter scenes were shot in the middle of a heat wave in Summer 2006, which required the production team to use artificial snow. Portions of the film were shot in West Bengal. Ruby Films was the production company. Sarah Gavron intended to film some scenes in Brick Lane. Because of opposition from some of the local community, police advised her to change locations after demonstrations were threatened. The novel and film provoked criticism by some in the Bangladeshi community in London, who thought that Chanu and the Bangladeshis from Sylheti generally, were portrayed in a negative way. Some traders organized against having the film company doing any production in the neighbourhood; on 31 July 2006, about 120 British Bangladeshis held a protest in Brick Lane. Others wrote letters to the editor in The Guardian and spoke in support of the film production, including the British chapter of PEN and the writer Salman Rushdie.

Etymology The species name antioquensis is in reference to the Colombian state of Antioquia. The only two individuals of this species ever encountered were both found in Eastern Antioquia. Discovery The species was first discovered in March 1996, when an adult male was discovered on the wall of a church in the Colombian municipality of Sons√≥n. The second individual discovered was also an adult male, which was encountered in April 1996. That specimen was located near San Luis, Colombia, near a karst formation.Mu√±oz, J., & Cuartas, C. A. (2001). Saccopteryx antioquensis n. sp.(Chiroptera: Emballonuridae) del noroeste de Colombia. Actualidades Biol√≥gicas, 23(75), 53-61. Description This bat is medium-sized for its genus. Its forearm measures . It has a total body length of . Its tail is long. Its ears are long. It has a dental formula of . Their teeth are overall small and delicate. It differs from other species in its genera by its lack of white dorsal lines. Two-thirds of the uropatagium is furred. Their dorsal fur is dark brown, with the hairs the same color throughout. Their ventral fur is lighter in color, and the hairs are bicolored; the proximate two-thirds of the hairs are dark brown like the dorsal hairs, while the distal third of the hairs are yellowish. Their coat is thick and woolly in texture, but their faces are hairless. Biology While its diet has not been studied, all other bats of its genus are specialized aerial insectivores.Nowak, R.M. (ed.) 1999. Walkers Mammals of the World. Sixth edition. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London. Range and habitat The only two individuals encountered were found in humid lowlands. Its occurrence could be associated with karst formations. Conservation In 2008, the species was evaluated by the IUCN for the first time. The designation was data deficient. In 2016, the species was reevaluated as endangered. It was listed as endangered because it is thought to have a range of less than , it is found in fewer than five locations, and projected decline in the area and quality of their habitat. Its habitat is not protected, and this species could be threatened by the expansion of agriculture. Surveys conducted in 2006-2016 failed to locate any individuals.

Nuri is situated about 15 km north of Sanam, and 10 km from Jebel Barkal. More than 20 ancient pyramids belonging to Nubian kings and queens are still standing at Nuri, which served as a royal necropolis for the ancient city of Napata, the first capital of the Nubian Kingdom of Kush. It is probable that, at its apex, 80 or more pyramids stood at Nuri, marking the tombs of royals. The pyramids at Nuri were built over a period of more than three centuries, from circa 670 BCE for the oldest (pyramid of Taharqa), to around 310 BCE (pyramid of king Nastasen). Map of Jebel Barkal and Nuri. The earliest known pyramid (Nu. 1) at Nuri belongs to king Taharqa which measures 51.75 meters square by 40 or by 50 metres high.The Pyramids of Nuri The pyramid of Taharqa was situated so that when observed from Gebel Barkal at sunrise on Egyptian New Year's Day, the beginning of the annual flooding of the Nile, the sun would rise from the horizon directly over its point.Timothy Kendall; 2002; Napatan temples: A case study from Gebel Barkal. Gebel Barkal, the Mythological Nubian Origin of Egyptian kingship, and the Formation of the Napatan state; pp.67-69. Tantamani, successor of Taharqa, was buried at el- Kurru, but all following Napatan kings and many of their queens and children until Nastasen (Nu. 15) (about 315 BC) were buried here, some 80 royals.Compare the list in Derek A. Welsby: The Kingdom of Kush. British Museum Press, London 1996, pp. 207-208 The pyramids at Nuri are, in general, smaller than the Egyptian ones and are today often heavily degraded (caused by both humans and nature), but often still contained substantial parts of the funerary equipment of the Kushite rulers who were buried here. During the Christian era, a church was erected here.Dunham, The Royal Cemeteries of Kush II, Nuri, fig. 216 The church was built at least in part from reused pyramid stones, including several stelae originally coming from the pyramid chapels. The pyramids were partially excavated by George Reisner in the early 20th century. In 2018, a new archaeological expedition began work at the site, directed by Pearce Paul Creasman.Updates for the expedition can be found online. The pyramids of Nuri, together with other buildings in the region around Gebel Barkal, have been placed on the UNESCO list of world cultural heritage sites since 2003.Gebel Barkal and the Sites of the Napatan Region at UNESCO.org Tombs at Nuri : See List of monarchs of Kush for more information.

F. Laming Macadam, \\"Names and Relationships of the Royal Family of Napata\\", The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 35 (December 1949), pp. 139-149 The pyramids of Nuri are built on two separate plateaus. The highest point in the cemetery is taken up by Taharqa's pyramid on the western plateau. The pyramids of the other kings are located on the eastern plateau. The pyramids of the royal women are placed closer to Taharqa's pyramid on the western plateau. These pyramids fall into three groups: (1) A group of pyramids is located to the south and west of Taharqa's pyramid; (2) Two parallel rows are located to the north of Taharqa's pyramid; (3) A group of very small tombs is located to the far north. The King's Mothers were buried in the southern group, but this is not an area exclusively used for the burial of King's Mothers. Most of the King's Wives were buried in the parallel rows just north of Taharqa's tomb. The tombs to the far north were much smaller and may have been built for wives of lesser rank.Angelika Lohwasser, \\"Queenship in Kush: Status, Role and Ideology of Royal Women\\", Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 38 (2001), pp. 61-76 * 30px Nuri 1 - King Taharqa, the earliest and largest of the Nuri pyramids * Nuri Pyramid II of King Amaniastabarqa r. c. 513-503 BCE Nuri 2 - King Amaniastabarqa * 30px Nuri 3 - King Senkamanisken * Pyramid Nuri 4 of Siaspiqa.

The book describes 1963 as a landmark year in the civil rights movement, and as the beginning of America's \\"Negro Revolution\\". Writing First edition The seed of the book is King's \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\". The letter became nationally known and received interest from the New York publishing world, which Stanley Levison relayed to King in May 1963.Branch, Parting the Waters (1989), p. 804. Soon after, Levison made a deal with New American Library publisher Victor Weybright, who suggested that the theme of not waiting be used for the title. Weybright also gave permission for \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" to be republished in national newspapers and magazines; it appeared in July 1963 as \\"Why the Negro Won't Wait\\".Bass, Blessed Are The Peacemakers (2002), p. 144. King began working on the book later in 1963, with assistance from Levison and Clarence Jones.\\"Why We Can't Wait\\", Encyclopedia (Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute), accessed 4 December 2019. Some early work on the text was done by Al Duckett (also a participant in the movement). King and Levison eventually dismissed Duckett and then Nat Lamar, and Levison did some work on the text himself. Bayard Rustin also contributed, as did editor Hermine I. Popper.Mieder, Making a Way Out of No Way (2010), p. 21. \\"Al Duckett, another ghostwriter, was involved in preparing the manuscript of King's third book Why We Can't Wait (1964), and while Rustin had asked not to be acknowledged for his labor, Duckett's help is mentioned by King before the introduction to the book. (Garrow 1986: 280 and 299).\\"Branch, Parting the Waters (1989), p. 910. Rustin said: \\"I don't want to write something for somebody where I know he is acting like a puppet. I want to be a real ghost and write what the person wants to say. And that is what I always knew was true in the case of Martin. I would never write anything that wasn't what he wanted to say. I understood him well enough.\\"Garrow, Bearing the Cross (1986), p. 649; quoted in Mieder \\"Making a Way Out of No Way\\" (2010), p. 22. The book largely reproduces the text of \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\", with some editorial changes.Bass, Blessed Are The Peacemakers (2002), p. 136‚Äì137. King writes in a footnote: \\"Although the text remains in substance unaltered, I have indulged in the author's prerogative in polishing it for publication.\\"King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), p. 76. Why We Can't Wait was published by Harper & Row in July 1964. The paperback edition cost 60¬¢. Outline The book describes 1963 as the beginning of \\"the Negro revolution\\". It seeks to describe the historical events that led up to this revolution, and to explain why this revolution was nonviolent.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 15‚Äì18. \\"Why did a thousand cities shudder almost simultaneously and why did the whole world‚Äîin gleaming capitals and mud-hut villages‚Äîhold its breath during those months? Why was it the year that the American Negro, so long ignored, so long written out of the pages of history books, tramped a declaration of freedom with his marching feet across the pages of newspapers, the television screens, and the magazines?\\" King seeks to describe this history because of how quickly it has become visible to America at large, and because of its importance in events to come. He writes: > Just as lightning makes no sound until it strikes, the Negro Revolution > generated quietly. But when it struck, the revealing flash of its power and > the impact of its sincerity and fervor displayed a force of a frightening > intensity. Three hundred years of humiliation, abuse, and deprivation cannot > be expected to find voice in a whisper. [...] > Because there is more to come; because American society is bewildered by > the spectacle of the Negro in revolt; because the dimensions are vast and > the implications deep in a nation with twenty million Negroes, it is > important to understand the history that is being made today.King, Why We > Can't Wait (1964), p. 16. Why 1963? King gives several reasons why the Negro Revolution erupted in 1963: * Disillusionment with the slow speed of school desegregation after Brown v. Board (1954).King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 18‚Äì19. \\"In order, then, to understand the deep disillusion of the Negro in 1963, one must examine his contrasting emotions at the time of the decision and during the nine years that followed. One must understand the pendulum swing between the elation that arose when the edict was handed down and the despair that followed the failure to bring it to life.\\" * Lack of confidence in politicians and government, particularly after the perceived failures of the Kennedy administration. These included a weak stance on housing discrimination and a lack of support for Black voting rights in the South.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 19‚Äì21. \\"The Negro felt that he recognized the same old bone that had been tossed to him in the past‚Äîonly now it was being handed to him on a platter.\\" * Decolonization of Africa (and of Asia), and the international perception of the American Negro as downtrodden and powerless. (See also: Year of Africa.)King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 21‚Äì22. * The centennial of the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation reminded Blacks that they remained oppressed in spite of their nominal legal freedom.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 22‚Äì25. \\"In 1963, the Negro, who had realized for many years that he was not truly free, awoke from a stupor of inaction with the cold dash of realization that 1963 meant one hundred years after Lincoln gave his autograph to the cause of freedom.\\" * The Great Depression never ended for African Americans; while others enjoyed an economic recovery, Black unemployment rose. King says that economic inequality in America became particularly obvious in 1963.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 23‚Äì24. * The rise to prominence of nonviolent direct action as a means for demanding change.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 25‚Äì26. \\"Tested in Montgomery during the winter of 1955‚Äì56, and toughened throughout the South in the eight ensuing years, nonviolent resistance has become, by 1963, the logical force in the greatest mass-action crusade that has ever occurred in American history.\\" Nonviolent resistance King goes on to describe why nonviolent resistance was so powerful. One of its major strengths involved changing the function of jails in society. Previously, the jail was used as an element of intimidation: authorities used the threat of pain and isolation in jail to control many separate individuals. Large groups of demonstrators, however, had the power to fill up jails‚Äîand to politicize the act of being jailed, thereby making jail less of a punishment.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 27‚Äì30. He condemns tokenism as an act of deception that offers false pride without real power: \\"The Negro wanted to feel pride in his race? With tokenism, the solution was simple. If all twenty million Negroes would keep looking at Ralph Bunche, the one man in so exalted a post would generate such a volume of pride that it could be cut into portions and served to everyone.\\"King, Why We Can't-Wait (1964), pp. 30‚Äì31. King distinguishes between tokenism and a \\"modest start\\" to equality, writing that tokenism serves to stifle dissent and protest, not to start a process.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 31‚Äì32. He criticizes other approaches to social change for Blacks, including the quietism of Booker T. Washington, the elitism of W. E. B. Du Bois's appeal to The Talented Tenth, the Pan-Africanism of Marcus Garvey, and the litigation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). King argues that none of these leaders and philosophies held the promise of real mass change for all African Americans.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 33‚Äì34. Birmingham King describes \\"Bull Connor's Birmingham\\" as an anachronistic city whose social order resembled colonial-era slavery. He writes that Blacks lack basic human rights, and are ruled by violence and terror.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 47‚Äì50. He chronicles preliminary demonstrations held by the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACHR)King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 51‚Äì52. and then describes Bull Connor's attempts to intimidate the SCLC.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), p. 53. He tells about how the SCLC nevertheless planned the Birmingham campaign, believing that if segregation could be overcome in Birmingham it could have effects across the entire United States.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 54‚Äì58. King describes the alliance between the SCLC and the ACHR, and reproduces the text of a \\"Commitment Card\\" used for recruiting. (Volunteers who signed the card pledged to meditate on the life of Jesus, pray daily, observe the interests of the community, and to seek \\"justice and reconciliation‚Äînot victory\\".)King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 59‚Äì64. He tells the story of how he was imprisoned in the course of demonstrationsKing, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 65‚Äì75. and then reproduces his (already and thereafter) famous \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\".King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 76‚Äì95. The city government became increasingly willing to negotiate as demonstrations continued. King describes mass participation by young people, full jails, and international media attention fueled by powerful photographs. Negotiators reached an agreement on Friday, May 10, 1963: the city promised desegregation within 90 days, jobs for Blacks in local industry, release of those jailed during the campaign, and ongoing formal diplomacy between Black and White leaders.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 96‚Äì106. The agreement triggered an assassination attempt on King, orchestrated by the local Ku Klux Klan. The bombing at King's hotel room triggered a civil disturbance in Birmingham which brought in the police forces and then the National Guard.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 106‚Äì107. Thousands of student demonstrators were expelled from school by the Birmingham Board of Education. The decision was challenged by the NAACP and overruled by Judge Elbert P. Tuttle in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 107‚Äì108. Ongoing revolution King advocates continued action in Birmingham, comparing the campaign to the Battle of Bunker Hill‚Äîthe beginning of organization in a revolutionary army. He warns against complacency in the wake of the Birmingham demonstrations, suggesting that revolt is only the beginning of revolution.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 113‚Äì117. He calls for multi-racial unity, suggesting that Africans were not the only group oppressed in America: \\"Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society.\\"King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 119‚Äì120. He argues that the summer of 1963 has made most Whites in America more receptive to the idea of legal equality for Blacks.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 121‚Äì122. \\"The summer of our discontent, far from alienating America's white citizens, brought them closer into harmony with its Negro citizens than ever before.\\" He describes the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, praising the participation of White churches but frustrated by the neutrality of the AFL‚ÄìCIO. He notes that millions of Americans watched scenes from the March on television and expresses hope for the future of this medium.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 123‚Äì125. The conclusion provides an explanation of \\"why we can't wait\\": that Blacks must no longer move towards freedom, but assert their freedom. King writes: \\"It is because the Negro knows that no person‚Äîas well as no nation‚Äîcan truly exist half slave and half free that he has embroiders upon his banners the significant word .\\"King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 123‚Äì129. He calls for a Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged, including reparations for unpaid wages.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 137‚Äì138. He holds out hope for a coalition with poor Whites and organized labor.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 141‚Äì142. He suggests that the civil rights movement may be able to work with President Lyndon Johnson, cautioning that political work is dangerous but necessary.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), pp. 146‚Äì151. He ends by saying that if the civil rights revolution succeeds it may spread nonviolence worldwide, ending the nuclear arms race and bringing world peace.King, Why We Can't Wait (1964), p. 152. \\"In measuring the full implications of the civil-rights revolution, the greatest contribution may be in the area of world peace.\\" Reception and effect The book was generally well received by the mainstream press. It also afforded the Letter from Birmingham Jail its widest circulation yet. King traveled to promote the book, while also still involved in the St. Augustine Movement.Garrow, Bearing the Cross (1986), p. 325. Why We Can't Wait was an important part of the effort to make the civil rights struggle known to national and international audiences. Describing Birmingham as \\"the most segregated city in America\\" transformed it into a symbol for segregation and inequality at large.Davi Johnson, \\"Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 Birmingham Campaign as Image Event\\", Rhetoric & Public Affairs 10(1), Spring 2007, accessed via Project Muse. Legacy Adbusters cited Why We Can't Wait (and the Poor People's Campaign) in September 2011 as an inspiration for Occupy Wall Street.\\"Why We Can't Wait: Some inspiration from Martin Luther King Jr. for Occupy Wall Street\\", Adbusters 96, 13 September 2011. In October 2011, the Obama administration started using the slogan \\"We Can't Wait\\", based on the plan to enact policies despite a resistant Congress.George Pyle, \\"Obama, like King, should know why we can't wait\\", Salt Lake Tribune, 5 November 2011. The book has received much contemporary critical acclaim, and was ranked #78 on Modern Library's list of the 100 best non-fiction books written in English. References=Bibliography * Bass, S.

As of 2015 it is the 14th largest tire maker in the world according to Tyres & Accessories. History Triangle Group was founded by the Weihai government in 1976. Lacking a car industry in China, the company supplied tiny tyres to Indonesian street-sweepers rubbish carts in the following years. The company grew in size but did not make money until in 1993 with the installment of new management, Triangle reworked itself into a competitive enterprise. In making dramatic reforms, the company invested in new, more modern production and implemented strict workforce discipline. The restructuring would continue into the 2000s, when the company considered a public offering and so brought its accounting to developed world standards and continuously invested in more sophisticated manufacturing lines. These efforts to make itself a top league tire maker would be the subject of a profile article in The Economist during June 2008. In recent years, the company has focused more on research and development, announcing a desire to become a technology leader, through research partnerships with universities. In 2011, it signed an agreement with the University of Akron to work together on polymer research and also opened an office in the same town of Akron, Ohio with plans for 30 employees. It partnered up in 2012 with the Harbin Institute of Technology to carry out research on designing and manufacturing tires for large bodied aircraft, enabling Triangle to compete with two other companies in China that already produce such tires. In 2015, Triangle Group announced its first venture into the U.S. market with the opening of their new North American headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee inside the Nashville Metropolitan Area,http://www.tirereview.com/triangle-plans-hq-for-nashville-area/ and in late 2017 selected Edgecombe County, North Carolina as the location for its first manufacturing facility in the United States where it expects to manufacture six million tires annually.https://governor.nc.gov/news/governor- cooper-announces-largest-ever-manufacturing-investment-rural-north-carolina At the start of 2016, Triangle truck and bus tyres started being distributed by multinational distributor Zenises.http://www.tyrepress.com/2016/01/zenises- begins-distribution-triangle-truck-tyres-in-germany Products The company works as a strategic partner and supplier to many overseas companies. It has struck partnerships with Caterpillar, Volvo, and Goodyear. In terms of market share success, the company's most dominant placement is in the off the road (OTR) category, which includes tires for mining, construction, and other industrial uses.

In a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle, Steve Heimoff, an editor of a competing wine magazine Wine Enthusiast, wrote that Laube's position as a critic in a prominent magazine should be more cautious about branding wines as being tainted when most wine drinkers do not have the same level of sensitivity to detect anything wrong with those wines.

Formed in 1963 as Dyno-Rod, Dyno initially specialised in the use of electromechanical machines for drain clearance. Since then, the company has grown considerably, consolidating its drainage business and diversifying into comprehensive plumbing services, for both domestic and industrial sites. It is a franchise granting limited company. Dyno describes itself as \\"the market leader\\", and \\"the only drain cleaning service with full national coverage.\\" Apart from clearing blockages, it uses CCTV to inspect drains, makes plumbing repairs, and installs new pipework. The company offers a twenty four hour emergency response service across the United Kingdom and Eire. Dyno-Rod was acquired by Centrica's subsidiary British Gas for ¬£57.6 million ($104.3m) in October 2004.  History  Dyno-Rod service was launched in 1963 by Jim Zockoll, in South London, and the business was based in Surbiton for many years. Zockoll was a pilot for Pan American, who spotted an opportunity whilst on a stopover in London: the hotel where he was staying was suffering drainage problems, had outdated repair equipment, and was taking too long on repairs. Zockoll realised that he had a business opportunity using newer American equipment. It is said that he had the equipment flown over, enabling him to fix the problem, and giving birth to the company Dyno-Rod. Dyno-Rod based its drain cleaning service on what were then new electromechanical techniques. After initial success, Dyno began granting franchise licences in 1965. There are currently twenty five Dyno franchisees in the United Kingdom. As the first non fast food franchised business in the United Kingdom, and the second franchised business of any kind there, Dyno-Rod played a prominent role in the formation of the British Franchise Association, of which it remains a full member. Over time, the Dyno brand developed other associated businesses. Dyno- Secure was launched in 1987, to offer a range of locks and security services, while in 2001, Dyno-Plumbing offered a comprehensive plumbing service. Dyno Group was acquired by British Gas, a subsidiary of Centrica, in October 2004. Since then, Dyno franchisees have developed larger territories and operate multiple brands within the Dyno group. The group is based in the British Gas Swan House office complex in Staines.  In popular culture  The then Prime Minister, David Cameron, compared himself in April 2014 to the company's services, saying \\"If there are things that are stopping you from doing more, think of me as a giant Dyno-Rod\\".

The wind farm is owned and operated by Tilt Renewables. It was the second major wind farm to be built in the South Island. History Resource consent was granted in 2007 and later confirmed after an appeal to the Environment Court. Construction of stage 1 of the wind farm, consisting of twelve turbines, began in September 2010. Vestas V90-3MW turbines were chosen for the wind farm, having previously been used for stage 3 of Tararua Wind Farm in 2007.

Resource consents were granted in 2009. Transmission Electricity generated from Stage 1 turbines is injected into the nearby Deep Stream and Waipori hydro schemes. This utilised the existing 33kV transmission line and avoided the cost of additional transmission infrastructure. Electricity from Stage 1 and the hydro schemes is then injected into either Dunedin's local distribution network, or into Transpower's Halfway Bush-Balclutha-Gore 110 kV line at Berwick. Stage 2 and beyond is too large to inject into the Waipori/Deep Stream system. Instead, it will inject into Transpower's Halfway Bush-Roxburgh 110 kV line, which passes a short distance south of the wind farm.

As a child, he was raised in an orphanage in North London before being adopted by a family from Battersea.  Military career  Falconer joined the British Royal Marines at the age of 18. At 19 years of age, he attended SBS selection in Poole Dorset and was one of nine Marines to successfully complete the course out of 147 men. Most candidates are required to serve some time in a Commando unit before applying, however Duncan was given an exception. Later he was posted to 42 Commando as a career broadening opportunity. Falconer served the majority of his military service with the SBS. During his time in the military, he also served with the SAS, and 14 Intelligence Detachment, deployed to Northern Ireland with each for one year and two and a half years respectively. After he left the Detachment he took a sabbatical for a year before returning to the SBS where he was posted to MAT (\\"Maritime Anti-Terrorism\\") operations in which he was involved in a number of exercises retaking oil rigs and tankers.  After the SBS After leaving the SBS Falconer spent two years working for a private security company. Falconer had planned to move to Central America, to specialise in kidnap and ransom negotiation work, but, whilst in Los Angeles he wrote his first screenplay which he sold weeks later. As a result, Falconer chose to remain in LA for more than a decade whilst pursuing two careers ‚Äî one as a screenplay writer, the other as a private security risk consultant. He also spent several years working as a bartender while writing screenplays and TV. Whilst living in LA, Falconer also wrote his autobiography. After September 11 attacks Falconer returned to the UK and joined a private security company based in Hereford. There he worked as a hostile environment instructor and security consultant for journalists, operating in many countries including Africa, the Middle East, Asia and South America. His autobiography, and first literary publication, First into Action included accounts of the actions carried out by the SBS and 14 Intelligence Detachment. The tone of this work was in contrast to a number of biographies of other ex-special forces personnel at the time ‚Äî the tales not just about the heroic actions of those he served alongside, but also showed the more humorous, realistic side of the troops. The book also highlighted the rivalry and antagonism between the Special Boat Service and Special Air Service and the history behind their conflict. Such was the success of the book, that Time Warner publishing contracted Falconer to write two military-based novels. The protagonist in these initial novels was John Stratton, created in the author's image and sharing a similar career path within the military, as an SBS operative and operating with an Intelligence Detachment in Northern Ireland. The vast majority of his work to date has retained Stratton as the central character. In The Protector Falconer introduced a new central character, Bernie Mallory. Mallory again has been crafted in the image of his creator, this time as a former Royal Marine turned private security contractor. Falconer moved to South Africa, then Dubai where he consulted on 'fuel and food' convoy moves across Afghanistan. Falconer moved back to Europe and also South Africa where he is a maritime and crisis management consultant for a UK-based security company. Falconer continues to write books and screenplays. In 2017 the film Stratton, based on the main character of his books, was released. It stars Dominic Cooper as Stratton as well as Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi and Thomas Kretschmann.

Career Born Kumiaki Sawaka, he joined Dewanoumi stable in 1935 and initially fought under the shikona of Hamanishiki, before changing to Masuiyama in 1937. After winning the makushita tournament championship or y≈´sh≈ç in 1939 he was promoted to j≈´ry≈ç and only two tournaments later, after picking up another championship, he was promoted to the top makuuchi division for the January 1941 tournament. In January 1942 he defeated yokozuna Haguroyama to earn his first gold star or kinboshi. He finished with a losing record but good performances over the next three tournaments took him to komusubi and then sekiwake in 1944. In the first postwar tournament held in a bomb-damaged Kokugikan in June 1945 he could manage only two wins and dropped back to the maegashira ranks, but he was runner-up to Haguroyama in November 1946 with a fine 11‚Äì2 record (alongside his stablemate Shionoumi). After earning his first sansh≈ç or special prize for Technique he returned to the san'yaku ranks, and in October 1948 he won his first top division championship. He took advantage of the poor condition of the three yokozuna and finished with a 10‚Äì1 record, defeating ≈çzeki Azumafuji in a playoff. After the tournament Azumafuji was promoted to yokozuna and Masuiyama was elevated to ≈çzeki.

He defeated maegashira Hajimayama, a fellow member of Dewanoumi stable, in another playoff on the final day. Retirement from sumo This was to be the last tourney Masuiyama was to complete. After pulling out of the next two tournaments through injury he retired in January 1950 at the age of 30, having spent only four tournaments at ≈çzeki rank. He became head coach of the small Mihogaseki stable. After a long period without success, he eventually managed to produce some strong sekitori, including Kitanoumi who reached yokozuna in 1974, and his eldest son, Masuiyama Daishir≈ç II, who was born in 1948, entered his father's stable in 1967 alongside Kitanoumi and reached the ≈çzeki rank in 1980. In November 1984 Masuiyama reached the mandatory retirement age set by the Japan Sumo Association and passed on control of Mihogaseki stable to his son. He died less than one year later.

Three parameters characterize this relationship: the consistency k, the flow index n, and the yield shear stress \\\\tau_0. The consistency is a simple constant of proportionality, while the flow index measures the degree to which the fluid is shear-thinning or shear-thickening. Ordinary paint is one example of a shear-thinning fluid, while oobleck provides one realization of a shear-thickening fluid. Finally, the yield stress quantifies the amount of stress that the fluid may experience before it yields and begins to flow. This non-Newtonian fluid model was introduced by Winslow Herschel and Ronald Bulkley in 1926. Definition The constitutive equation of the Herschel-Bulkley model is commonly written as :\\\\tau = \\\\tau_{0} + k \\\\dot{\\\\gamma} ^ {n} where \\\\tau is the shear stress, \\\\dot{\\\\gamma} the shear rate, \\\\tau_{0} the yield stress, k the consistency index, and n the flow index. If \\\\tau < \\\\tau_{0} the Herschel-Bulkley fluid behaves as a rigid (non- deformable) solid, otherwise it behaves as a fluid. For n<1 the fluid is shear-thinning, whereas for n>1 the fluid is shear-thickening. If n=1 and \\\\tau_0=0, this model reduces to the Newtonian fluid. As a generalized Newtonian fluid model, the effective (or apparent) viscosity is given as K. C. Sahu, P. Valluri, P. D. M. Spelt, and O. K. Matar (2007) 'Linear instability of pressure-driven channel flow of a Newtonian and a Herschel‚ÄìBulkley fluid' Phys. Fluids 19, 122101 : \\\\mu_{\\\\operatorname{eff}} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mu_0, & \\\\dot{\\\\gamma} \\\\leq \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_0 \\\\ k \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}^{n-1}+\\\\tau_0 \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}^{-1} , & \\\\dot{\\\\gamma} \\\\geq \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_0 \\\\end{cases} The limiting viscosity \\\\mu_0 is chosen such that \\\\mu_0=k \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_0^{n-1}+\\\\tau_0 \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_0^{-1}. A large limiting viscosity means that the fluid will only flow in response to a large applied force. This feature captures the Bingham-type behaviour of the fluid. In an incompressible flow, the viscous stress tensor is given as a viscosity, multiplied by the rate-of-strain tensor :\\\\tau_{ij} = 2 \\\\mu_{\\\\operatorname{eff}}(\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}) E_{ij} = \\\\mu_{\\\\operatorname{eff}}(\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}) \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i}{\\\\partial x_j}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_j}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\right), where the magnitude of the shear rate is given by :\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}=\\\\sqrt{2E_{ij}E^{ij}}. The magnitude of the shear rate is an isotropic approximation, and it is coupled with the second invariant of the rate-of-strain tensor :II_E = tr(E_{ij} E^{jk}) = E_{ij}E^{ij}. Channel flow A schematic diagram pressure-driven horizontal flow. The flow is uni-directional in the direction of the pressure gradient. A frequently-encountered situation in experiments is pressure-driven channel flow D. J. Acheson 'Elementary Fluid Mechanics' (1990), Oxford, p. 51 (see diagram). This situation exhibits an equilibrium in which there is flow only in the horizontal direction (along the pressure- gradient direction), and the pressure gradient and viscous effects are in balance. Then, the Navier-Stokes equations, together with the rheological model, reduce to a single equation: Velocity profile of the Herschel‚ÄìBulkley fluid for various flow indices n. In each case, the non-dimensional pressure is \\\\pi_0=-10. The continuous curve is for an ordinary Newtonian fluid (Poiseuille flow), the broken-line curve is for a shear-thickening fluid, while the dotted-line curve is for a shear-thinning fluid. :\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}\\\\left(\\\\mu\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, =\\\\begin{cases}\\\\mu_0\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial{z}^2},&\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right<\\\\gamma_0\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}\\\\left[\\\\left(k\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right^{n-1}+\\\\tau_0\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right^{-1}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right],&\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right\\\\geq\\\\gamma_0\\\\end{cases} To solve this equation it is necessary to non-dimensionalize the quantities involved. The channel depth H is chosen as a length scale, the mean velocity V is taken as a velocity scale, and the pressure scale is taken to be P_0=k\\\\left(V/H\\\\right)^n. This analysis introduces the non-dimensional pressure gradient \\\\pi_0=\\\\frac{H}{P_0}\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}, which is negative for flow from left to right, and the Bingham number: :Bn=\\\\frac{\\\\tau_0}{k}\\\\left(\\\\frac{H}{V}\\\\right)^n. Next, the domain of the solution is broken up into three parts, valid for a negative pressure gradient: * A region close to the bottom wall where \\\\partial u/\\\\partial z>\\\\gamma_0; * A region in the fluid core where \\\\partial u/\\\\partial z<\\\\gamma_0; * A region close to the top wall where \\\\partial u/\\\\partial z<-\\\\gamma_0, Solving this equation gives the velocity profile: u\\\\left(z\\\\right)=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{n}{n+1}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi_0}\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\pi_0\\\\left(z-z_1\\\\right)+\\\\gamma_0^n\\\\right)^{1+\\\\left(1/n\\\\right)}-\\\\left(-\\\\pi_0z_1+\\\\gamma_0^n\\\\right)^{1+\\\\left(1/n\\\\right)}\\\\right],&z;\\\\in\\\\left[0,z_1\\\\right]\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\pi_0}{2\\\\mu_0}\\\\left(z^2-z\\\\right)+k,&z;\\\\in\\\\left[z_1,z_2\\\\right],\\\\ \\\\frac{n}{n+1}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi_0}\\\\left[\\\\left(-\\\\pi_0\\\\left(z-z_2\\\\right)+\\\\gamma_0^n\\\\right)^{1+\\\\left(1/n\\\\right)}-\\\\left(-\\\\pi_0\\\\left(1-z_2\\\\right)+\\\\gamma_0^n\\\\right)^{1+\\\\left(1/n\\\\right)}\\\\right],&z;\\\\in\\\\left[z_2,1\\\\right]\\\\ \\\\end{cases} Here k is a matching constant such that u\\\\left(z_1\\\\right) is continuous. The profile respects the no-slip conditions at the channel boundaries, :u(0)=u(1)=0, Using the same continuity arguments, it is shown that z_{1,2}=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\pm\\\\delta, where \\\\delta=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_0\\\\mu_0}{\\\\pi_0}\\\\leq \\\\tfrac{1}{2}. Since \\\\mu_0=\\\\gamma_0^{n-1}+Bn/\\\\gamma_0, for a given \\\\left(\\\\gamma_0,Bn\\\\right) pair, there is a critical pressure gradient \\\\pi_{0,\\\\mathrm{c}}=2\\\\left(\\\\gamma_0+Bn\\\\right). Apply any pressure gradient smaller in magnitude than this critical value, and the fluid will not flow; its Bingham nature is thus apparent. Any pressure gradient greater in magnitude than this critical value will result in flow. The flow associated with a shear-thickening fluid is retarded relative to that associated with a shear-thinning fluid.  Pipe flow  For laminar flow Chilton and Stainsby Chilton, RA and R Stainsby, 1998, \\"Pressure loss equations for laminar and turbulent non-Newtonian pipe flow\\", Journal of Hydraulic Engineering 124(5) pp. 522 ff. provide the following equation to calculate the pressure drop. The equation requires an iterative solution to extract the pressure drop, as it is present on both sides of the equation. : \\\\frac {\\\\Delta P} {L} = \\\\frac {4 K} {D} \\\\left( \\\\frac {8 V} {D} \\\\right) ^ n \\\\left( \\\\frac {3 n + 1} {4 n} \\\\right) ^ n \\\\frac {1} {1 - X} \\\\left( \\\\frac {1} {1 - a X - b X^2 - cX^3} \\\\right) ^ n : X = \\\\frac {4 L \\\\tau_ y} {D \\\\Delta P} : a = \\\\frac {1} {2 n + 1} : b = \\\\frac {2 n} { \\\\left( n + 1 \\\\right) \\\\left( 2 n + 1 \\\\right) } : c = \\\\frac {2 n ^ 2} { \\\\left( n + 1 \\\\right) \\\\left( 2 n + 1 \\\\right) } :For turbulent flow the authors propose a method that requires knowledge of the wall shear stress, but do not provide a method to calculate the wall shear stress. Their procedure is expanded in Hathoot Hathoot, HM, 2004, \\"Minimum-cost design of pipelines transporting non-Newtonian fluids\\", Alexandrian Engineering Journal, 43(3) 375 - 382 : R = \\\\frac {4 n \\\\rho V D \\\\left( 1 - a X - b X^2 - cX^3 \\\\right)} {\\\\mu_{Wall} \\\\left(3 n + 1 \\\\right) } : : \\\\mu_{Wall} = \\\\tau_{Wall}^{1 - 1/n} \\\\left( \\\\frac {K} {1 - X} \\\\right) ^ {1/n} : : \\\\tau_{Wall} = \\\\frac {D \\\\Delta P} {4 L} :All units are SI :\\\\Delta P Pressure drop, Pa. :L Pipe length, m :D Pipe diameter, m :V Mean fluid velocity, m/s :Chilton and Stainsby state that defining the Reynolds number as :Re = \\\\frac {R} {n ^ 2 \\\\left( 1 - X \\\\right) ^ 4} allows standard Newtonian friction factor correlations to be used. The pressure drop can then be calculated, given a suitable friction factor correlation. An iterative procedure is required, as the pressure drop is required to initiate the calculations as well as be the outcome of them.

Launched in November 1865 under her original name of Napol√©on III, she was converted from a paddle steamer to single propeller propulsion in 1871 and, in recognition of the recent defeat of her imperial namesake, the Emperor Napoleon III, was renamed Ville du Havre. In the early hours of 22 November 1873, Ville du Havre collided with the Scottish three-masted iron clipper, Loch Earn and sank in 12 minutes with the loss of 226 lives. Only 61 passengers and 26 crew members survived, rescued by Loch Earn and subsequently, an American vessel, Tremountain.  History and description  Napoleon III was originally built as a paddle steamer by Thames Ironworks, London (engines by Ravenshill & Salked, London) in late 1865 for the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique (French Line). She was a 3,950 gross ton ship, length 365.9ft with 45.9ft beam, straight stem, two funnels, two masts, iron construction, paddle wheel propulsion and a cruising speed of 11.5 knots.Wolcott, Oliver (1994). A sad tale that must be told: Madeleine Curtis Mixter's account of the loss of the Ville du Havre. American Neptune. Vol. 57, No. 3. There was accommodation for 170 first class, 100 second class and 50 third class passengers. Launched in November 1865, she sailed on her maiden voyage from Le Havre for Brest and New York City on 26 April 1866. She made five round voyages on this service, the last commencing in August 1869. In September 1871, she sailed from Le Havre to Tyneside in Northern England where she was lengthened to 421.7ft by A. Leslie and Company, Hebburn-on-Tyne and her tonnage increased to 5,065 tons. She was also fitted with compound steam engines and rebuilt with single screw propulsion, and the paddle wheels were removed. A third mast was also fitted and after completion of the works she was renamed Ville du Havre. Following sea trials, she recommenced her Le Havre ‚Äì Brest ‚Äì New York service in early 1873.Neider, Charles (2000). Great shipwrecks and castaways. Cooper Square Press, New York. . .  Final voyage and sinking  On 15 November 1873, Ville du Havre sailed from New York with 313 passengers and crew on board, under the command of captain Marino Surmonte.Ville du Havre (2008).

About half way across the Atlantic ocean, she collided with the iron clipper, Loch Earn at about 2 a.m. in the morning of Saturday, 22 November, at the position . At the time of the collision, Ville du Havre was proceeding under both steam and sail at about 12 knots. The sinking of Ville du Havre The captain of Loch Earn, after first sighting Ville du Havre and realising she was dangerously close, rang the ship's bell and \\"ported his helm\\", thus turning the boat to starboard. The helm of Loch Earn was put to starboard, but Ville du Havre came right across Loch Earn's bow.Lubbock, Basil (1921). The Colonial Clippers. (p. 223). Published by Kessinger Publishing. . . Ville du Havre was violently shaken by the collision and noise, and woke all the passengers. Confused, most passengers went on deck, only to discover the ship was rapidly sinking. The captain assured them that all was fine, but in reality the ship had been nearly broken in two, and it did not take long for passengers to realize the situation was desperate. Commotion and chaos overtook panicked passengers. They started grabbing life preservers and trying to push lifeboats into the water. Unfortunately, these had recently been painted, and they were now stuck fast to the deck. Finally a few of them were yanked loose, and passengers fought desperately to be one of the few travelers to board those boats.Chaffart, Rob (2008). The Disaster of the Ville du Havre. Retrieved on 30 July 2008. Shortly after the collision, Ville du Havre's main and mizzen masts collapsed, smashing two of the liner's life boats and killing several people. The time for saving life was very short as the ship sank in less than 12 minutes, and finally broke into two pieces as she went. Captain Robertson of Loch Earn did all he possibly could to rescue the drowning and eventually 61 passengers and 26 of the crew were rescued and taken on board that ship. However, 226 passengers and crew perished. Loch Earn, herself in danger of sinking, was subsequently rescued by the American cargo ship, Tremountain and all Ville du Havre passengers and crew were transferred to that ship. Loch Earn, with its bow smashed in, commenced to sink as the bulkheads gave way, so she was abandoned at sea by her crew and sank shortly afterwards.Encyclopedia of Australian Shipwrecks (2008).

Spafford family tragedy Chicago lawyer and Presbyterian elder Horatio Spafford was to have been a passenger on board Ville du Havre. At the last moment, however, Spafford was detained by real estate business, so his Norwegian-born wife, Anna Spafford, went on ahead for Paris. The couple's four daughters: Anna \\"Annie\\" (born 11 June 1862), Margaret Lee \\"Maggie\\" (born 31 May 1864), Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" (born 19 June 1868), and Tanetta (born 24 July 1871) accompanied her. After the collision, only Mrs. Spafford was rescued. She was picked up unconscious and floating upon a plank of wood and then taken aboard Loch Earn. A fellow survivor, Pastor Nathanael Weiss, later quoted Anna Spafford as saying, \\"God gave me four daughters. Now they have been taken from me. Someday I will understand why\\". Nine days after the shipwreck, the survivors landed at Cardiff, Wales. Anna Spafford telegraphed her husband, \\"Saved alone. What shall I do . . .\\" Upon receiving her telegram, Horatio Spafford immediately left Chicago to bring his wife home. During the Atlantic crossing, the Captain called Spafford into his cabin to tell him that they were passing over the spot where his four daughters had drowned. Spafford later wrote to Rachel, his wife's half-sister, \\"On Thursday last we passed over the spot where she went down, in mid-ocean, the waters three miles deep.

History  The Victoria Foundry near Chesterfield, Derbyshire was owned and run by William Oliver and his father John Oliver from the mid-1850s until 1862 when, following the death of the father, it became the sole property of William. The Victoria Foundry, located at what was formerly Shepley's Yard, relocated to a greenfield site at Broad Oaks Meadows, south east of the town centre close by the Midland Railway‚Äôs main line. Disaster hit the business in 1885, a slump in the coal and iron trades and the high overheads of the new factory and equipment undermined the firm and the following year Oliver called in the receivers. In 1889 the business was sold to industrialist Charles Paxton Markham and became Markham & Co. Ltd. Mining. Markham's continued the business of building winding engines for collieries begun by Oliver and supplied many collieries in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and South Yorkshire. So well known were Markham's products that in the ten years from 1927, in a time of economic depression, the Markham works built 20 winding engines for gold mines in South Africa, giving the Chesterfield workforce regular work in a difficult period. By 1948, the company had built more than 200 steam and electric winding engines and associated machinery for the home and export markets including a mine winder with a 34 feet diameter drum, 7 feet larger than the ones which made William Oliver move to new premises. The company diversified over the years and in 1948 the Broad Oaks works were making haulage gears, rolling mills and ancillary equipment, steel girders, large steel-framed buildings, light alloy extrusion presses, spun cast iron plant, blast furnace plant, large iron castings and research equipment in addition to its involvement in turbine and tunnelling operations. Tunnelling. In the early years of the 20th century the company built and supplied tunnelling equipment for the construction of London's new (deep tunnel) Underground, the Mersey Tunnel and during the 1930s the Moscow Underground. The tunnelling equipment was a success and more orders followed, post-war productions included tunnelling shields for the Dartford Tunnel under the River Thames and in the 1980s for the Channel Tunnel. War Time works During the Second World War the firm worked on several secret projects including building X craft submarines for Vickers-Armstrong. They built X22 Exploit, X 23 Xphias, XE 11 Lucifer, XE 12 Excitable. Others were built by Marshalls of Gainsborough and Broadbent of Huddersfield. Markhams built a large number of presses for Loewy during the war for other firms making components for the war effort, as well as gun barrel turning lathes and rifling machines for Cravens Ltd, a sister company.  Company sale  In 1925, Charles Paxton Markham reconstituted his company as part of the Staveley Coal and Iron Company ensuring its future. The following year, Charles Paxton Markham died and ownership of the company changed again. By 1937, the firm had been bought by Sheffield-based steel makers and engineers John Brown & Company for ¬£50,000, the Chesterfield works continuing operations as before. John Brown was taken over by Trafalgar House, who also owned the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company. Trafalgar House was subsequently taken over by the Kvaerner Group of Norway in 1996. The works was closed by Kvaerner in 1998 and the site redeveloped for housing following a sale by the firm who took over John Brown's parent company. The company is now merged with former Trafalgar House engineering subsidiary Davy in Sheffield to form Davy Markham, and specialises in large engineering fabrications and machining works, from the Davy site in Sheffield.Markham & Company of Chesterfield, Davy Markham worked on the fabrication of the \\"B of the Bang\\" sculpture installed outside the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England.

He acted as an executioner from 1947 to 1961 and killed more than 200 people. He is the author of a book \\"The Executioner's Tale\\" (Paroles de bourreau : T√©moignage unique d'un √©x√©cuteur des arr√™ts criminels) answering questions about his career as an executioner. He inherited the job of executioner from his father Maurice Meyssonnier in 1947 when he ended compulsory education. His ancestors had been executioners from ages ago. When Algeria became independent from France in 1961, the guillotine was replaced by execution by firing squad. In 1961, shortly before Algerian independence, Fernand Meyssonnier went to Tahiti where he met his future wife with whom he had a daughter, and founded several businesses. After his retirement, he went to metropolitan France. He bought a house in Fontaine-de-Vaucluse where he died on August 8, 2008. Meyssonnier had been erroneously called the \\"last (French) executioner alive\\". In fact, he died the same year as Marcel Chevalier, the last French chief executioner, who served from 1976 to 1977.

He was educated at Portsmouth Grammar School, from where he joined the Post Office Engineering Department in 1944. Biography In 1948 he was granted an Emergency Commission in the Royal Corps of Signals and posted to 2nd Divisional Signal Regiment in Germany. At the end of his National Service in 1949, he joined the Territorial Army with 3 (Line of Communication) Signal Regiment. Unfulfilled with civilian life after a taste of the military, he applied to return to the Royal Signals in 1951 and was granted a Regular Commission. He was posted to Cyprus then to the Canal Zone in early 1952, before moving to El Ballah to command 32nd Guards Brigade Signal Troop. It was here that he met his future wife, Joy, who was attached to the British Military Hospital. In 1954, the couple returned to Britain for their wedding and settled in Richmond, Yorkshire; the couple would have three children. In 1957, Stonham was appointed Signal Officer, Joint Experimental Helicopter Unit at RAF Middle Wallop, where he was involved in day and night navigation and homing trials for military helicopters.Info re Joint Experimental Helicopter Unit; accessed 6 September 2014. Postings to Malaya and Germany followed during the childhood of their three daughters. Stonham became increasingly involved in intelligence-based jobs as he was promoted through to Lieutenant Colonel, taking command of 4th Division Headquarters and Signal Regiment in Herford until 1971. The two years following command were with the Defence Intelligence Staff at the Ministry of Defence, spending time with the American forces in Vietnam during the \\"Vietnamisation\\" programme, also visiting Laos and Cambodia. Promoted to Colonel in 1973, he was appointed Chief Instructor at the School of Signals in Blandford for two years. This was followed by six months on the Senior Officers' War Course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and then 18 months as Chief Signal Officer, Headquarters 3rd Division at Bulford. On promotion to Brigadier in 1978, he commanded 12 Signal Brigade (Volunteers), being appointed an Aide-de-Camp to the Queen in July 1980. His last tour, before retiring in July 1982, was as Brigadier General Staff (Author) in the Ministry of Defence where he wrote the classified operational history of the Northern Ireland campaign. As Special Assistant to the Director of Personnel, he occupied Room 105 at Broadcasting House in London from 1982, following his departure from the Army, until October 1988. The role he inherited at the BBC was to liaise with MI5 regarding whether candidates for roles at the broadcasting corporation had suspicious political connections, particularly with communism. However, Stonham's role from his appointment in 1982 was to 'wind down' the vetting and reduce the number of BBC staff appointments that were subject to vetting. Sir Hugh Greene, a former Director-General of the BBC, said about Security Service vetting of BBC job applicants: > I was vetted in 1940. MI5 thought I was a Communist but it turned out to be > a mistake. Michael Grade, at the time Controller of BBC 1, also commented on the existence of Room 105, where Stonham was based: > I don't know about room 105, but it does sound like a good title for a drama > series.\\"The Blacklist in Room 105\\", cambridgeclarion.org; accessed 30 August > 2014.

Biography He was born in 1943 in Saluzzo, Italy. In Turin he got the Master of Arts degree with Carlo Mollino. Apprenticeship in the ateliers of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Carlo Scarpa, Oscar Niemeyer and Kenzo Tange. In 1967 Pier Paolo Maggiora opens his own practice in Turin and few later he founds The Studio ArchA. In the following years, during the post-industrial and environmental/infrastructure crisis, he develops some project proposals which involve, starting from architecture, environmental, land and urban aspects, which lead to his theory of ‚Äúarchitectural territory‚Äù. That is an idea of territory that is thought of in his organic and wider efficiency - cultural, social, economic, functional and aesthetic ‚Äì as an attractive pole that spread of dynamic and creative energy. Dialogue in Architecture In the 1980s he laid down the foundations of his theory for a \\"Dialogue in Architecture\\", for the promotion of creative projects between architects and, at the same time, to restore the charm of the unitarian diversity, which has created layers over the centuries in the historic city. His professional activity is based on this general concept of Architecture and its role in civil society, and is expressed in a big number of projects and works, where the theory is embodied in structures, masses, surfaces, facilities. In the convergence of stimulus and information from different disciplines (ecology, anthropology, urban planning, engineering, sociology, economics, management and finance) is defined, through his whole work, the architectural synthesis where philosophical principles are called to intertwine in forms and functions offered to the social fruition. Projects The following are some of the latest projects: * The Caofeidian EcoCity‚Äù, the first town of the Third Millennium, Tanghshan, China; * the Third City of Jinhua, part of the ‚Äú100 Cities Project‚Äù, which the architect, Mr Pier Paolo Maggiora, has designed as Italy's contribution to the Chinese programme to move hundreds of millions of country people into the city, China; * ‚Äú100 City Project‚Äù, Method proposal about a definition of New Urban System in the China urbanization program, in the cooperation between Italy and China Governments; * The \\"Green Lagoon\\", the new central metropolitan area in Settimo Torinese, Turin, Italy; * The New Tower of the Milan exhibition area Fiera di Milano in Rho, Italy; * The ‚ÄúNew Arcade‚Äù , financial district in Verona, Italy; * CityLife: the ‚Äúnew center‚Äù of Milan, in the historical exhibition area (with Zaha Hadid, Arata Isozaki and Daniel Libeskind), Italy; * Susa 2 complex (2004), that completes the Sitaf headquarter system which was realized beginning 1990 in Susa, Turin, Italy; * The \\"Tower 18\\" in Brescia, Italy; * The Turin Health Park in Turin, Italy; * The Central Olympic Compound For the Turin 2006 Olympic Games (with Arata Isozaki), Italy; * The ‚ÄúParque Urbano‚Äù Headquarters in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Quote \\"In the first place, there is a factor that unifies Pier Paolo Maggiora‚Äôs architecture and outlines its cultural essence, even before its style. In fact, it is not only universally acknowledged as urban architecture that fits in perfectly with the social and visual context it is meant for, but also ‚Äì and especially ‚Äì as metropolitan architecture. This means it is intended to redesign the context that hosts it, so as to relaunch it into a wider perspective of new functions and new images. From this point of view, Maggiora‚Äôs work fits into a leading-edge trend of contemporary design culture, which sees architecture as a social service that is capable of participating in a project for collective existence. In all of the Turinese architect‚Äôs main works, the urban territory is immediately configured as the grounds for an organized and planned development thanks to the presence of an architectural artefact. Indeed, in its perfect functional efficiency, the latter sets itself as an attraction that radiates dynamic and creative potential.\\" Maurizio Vitta. Pier Paolo Maggiora.

Many of his shows have some of the longest run times on French television, such as Paris Derni√®re, Tout le monde en parle, and On a tout essay√©. He is the author of several books, including best-sellers (Louis XX ‚Äì Contre-enqu√™te sur la Monarchie and Confessions d‚Äôun Babyboomer). In 2013, he released and produced the French movie Max.  Biography  His parents were originally from Nice, in southern France. His father, a construction worker, settled for a short while in Bourganeuf (Creuse) where Thierry Ardisson was born.  Early Career in Advertising and Journalism  In 1969, Thierry Ardisson moved to Paris to start a career in advertising. He was first hired at BBDO, then at TBWA, and later at Ted Bates, before founding his own agency, Business, in 1978 with √âric Bousquet and Henri Bach√©. While working for Business, he invented the 8-second TV ad format to allow low-budget advertisers to access television media. As a copywriter, he wrote a number of memorable slogans for French consumers. Business also sold articles to French newspapers and magazines. As a writer, he contributed to the underground magazine, Fa√ßade. In 1984, he was hired as the vice-director of publications for the Hachette-Filipacchi press group. His editorial decisions were considered too provocative and led to his discharge. But in 1992, he worked a new partnership with Hachette-Filipacchi and launched the magazine Entrevue. He sold his shares of the company back to Hachette-Filipacchi in 1995. In 1998, he launched the consumer magazine J‚Äô√©conomise (‚ÄúI save up‚Äù) which peaked at 420,000 prints.  Career in Television  In 1980, in the course of the interviews that his agency Business conducted for French newspapers and magazines, Thierry Ardisson interviewed French tennis player Yannick Noah who admitted to smoking hashish and that tennis players regularly took amphetamines before the games, a scandal that led to his first appearance on television. In 1985, he adapted his press interviews (called Descente de police) for the French TV network TF1, but the concept ‚Äì too brutal and provocative ‚Äì got censored by French media authorities. TF1 kept him to host the show Scoop √† la une. He then coproduced the show √Ä la folie pas du tout from 1986 to 1987, hosted by later- famous news anchor host, Patrick Poivre-d‚ÄôArvor. In 1987, he sold his shares of his advertising agency Business and founded the TV production company Ardisson & Lumi√®res.

From 1988 and 1990, he hosted the show Lunettes noires pour nuits blanches, shot in the parisian theater Le Palace and aired on French TV channel Antenne 2. For this show, he created the concept of ‚Äúformatted interviews‚Äù such as ‚Äúinterview first time,‚Äù ‚Äúself-interview‚Äù or ‚Äústupid questions.‚Äù During the same period, he coproduced the show Stars √† la Barre. Afterwards, he hosted the show T√©l√© Z√®bre, which introduced two famous French comedians: Yvan Le Bolloc'h and Bruno Solo. From 1991 to 1992, he hosted the late-night game show Double jeu with Laurent Baffie, a show that was also considered too provocative and was canceled by TV network Antenne 2 in early 1993. From 1992 to 1994, he produced the shows Frou-Frou, Graines de Stars and Flashback. In 1995, he produced and hosted Paris Derni√®re on the French cable channel Paris Premi√®re. In 1997, he hosted Rive droite / Rive gauche with Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder, √âlisabeth Quin and Philippe Tesson.

Founded in 1924, the neighborhood has been the filming location of countless movies and television shows due to its convenient location between Fox Studios and Sony Studios. The neighborhood has also long been home to many actors, television personalities, and studio executives. Geography Map showing the boundaries of Cheviot Hills According to The New York Times, Cheviot Hills is bounded by the northern limits of the Rancho Park Golf Course and the Hillcrest Country Club to the north, Patricia Avenue and Manning Avenue to the west and southwest, and Beverwil Drive and Castle Heights Avenue to the east and southeast. According to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, Cheviot Hills' street and other borders are Rancho Park Golf Course and Hillcrest Country Club to the northwest; Anchor Avenue and Club Drive to the east; and Manning Avenue to the southwest.The Thomas Guide: Los Angeles County, 2004, page 632 Using these boundaries, Cheviot Hills is flanked on the north by West Los Angeles and Century City, on the east by Beverlywood and Castle Heights, on the south by Palms, and on the west by Rancho Park. The Mapping L.A. boundaries are broader than those recognized by the Cheviot Hills Homeowners' Association (CHHOA). Although the CHHOA covers areas beyond the original Cheviot Hills tract, such as Monte-Mar Vista and most of Tract 13945, Mapping L.A.'s boundaries also include all or parts other neighborhoods, such as Castle Heights and California Country Club Estates, which have their own homeowners' associations. \\"Terrace View\\", former residence of actress Agnes Moorehead, as example of typical house in Cheviot Hills Population The 2000 U.S. census counted 6,945 residents in the 1.54-square-mile Cheviot Hills neighborhood‚Äîan average of 4,520 people per square mile, among the lowest densities for the city; The acreage include the open areas of the Cheviot Hills Park, the Rancho Park Golf Course and Hillcrest Country Club. in 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 7,303. The median age for residents was 42, older than the city at large; the percentages of residents aged 50 to 64 were among the county's highest. The neighborhood was considered \\"not especially diverse\\" ethnically, with a high percentage of white people in comparison to the rest of Los Angeles. The population was 78.8% Non-Hispanic White, 9.1% Asian, 8.3% Hispanic or Latino, 1.3% Black, and 2.5% from other groups. Japan (8.8%) and Mexico (7.7%) were the most common places of birth for the 20.8% of the residents who were born abroad‚Äîconsidered a low figure for Los Angeles. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $111,813, a high figure for Los Angeles, and the percentage of households earning $125,000 and up was considered high for the county. The average household size of 2.2 people was low for both the city and the county. Renters occupied 35.7% of the housing stock and house- or apartment owners held 64.3%. The percentages of veterans who served during World War II or the Korean War were among the county's highest. History Cheviot Hills in 1928. This house was designed by Eugene R. Ward and was named \\"Terrace View\\" by the builder. It was home to publisher=}} (Modern day photo featured earlier in this article) Almost all of today's Cheviot Hills was within the Spanish land grant known as Rancho Rincon de los Bueyes. Largely undeveloped until the 1920s, initial construction in the residential section west of Motor Avenue dates to the 1920s. From the 1920s to 1953, the streetcar line known as the Santa Monica Air Line of the Pacific Electric Railway ran along the southern edge of Cheviot Hills and provided passenger service between Cheviot Hills, downtown Los Angeles, and downtown Santa Monica. Much of the neighborhood east of Motor Avenue and south of Forrester Drive was built on the site of the former California Country Club, and the residences date to the early 1950s. The neighborhood features several homes by prominent architects, such as the Strauss-Lewis House by Raphael Soriano and the Harry Culver Estate, designed by Wallace Neff. The neighborhood was originally middle class, with 1926 prices for homes starting at $50,000, or around $663,000 today. However, prices have increased dramatically in recent years and now rival those of neighboring Beverly Hills, Bel Air, and Holmby Hills, resulting in a surge of new development at the cost of many of the neighborhood's original 1920s homes. Consequently, Cheviot Hills was named Redfin's \\"hottest\\" neighborhood in the country for real estate for 2014, and the \\"hottest\\" neighborhood in Los Angeles for 2015. In 2015 CityLab named Cheviot Hills as the 24th most expensive neighborhood in the United States to rent in. Monte Mar Vista Developed between 1926 and 1940, Monte Mar Vista is the most affluent part of Cheviot Hills. The neighborhood was originally developed by W.R. McConnell, Fred W. Forrester, and John P. Haynes and consists of sixteen blocks along the northern side of Cheviot Hills bound by the Hillcrest Country Club, Cheviot Hills Park, and Rancho Park Golf Course to the north, west, and east and Lorenzo, Forrester, and Club Drive to the south. In 1928, the development was taken over by Ole Hanson and the Frank Meline Company, who continued to develop the neighborhood. Because of the area's location, many properties enjoy expansive views that overlook the Hillcrest Country Club and Rancho Park Golf Course as well as views of Century City, the Hollywood Hills, and the Hollywood Sign. Many of the lots are large, often covering several parcels, and homes were designed by prominent architects including John L. DeLario, Roland E. Coartes, Wallace Neff, and Eugene R. Ward. The first house designed by Craig Ellwood, Lappin House, is located in this part of Cheviot Hills. California Country Club Estates Built in 1952 on the site of the former California Country Club, California Country Club Estates is a neighborhood of single-family homes that is known locally as New Cheviot, as opposed to the rest of Cheviot Hills which is known as Old Cheviot. The neighborhood is located within Cheviot Hills, bound to the north by Club Drive and to the west by Queensbury Drive, but has a separate home owner's association with binding CC&Rs; attached to each lot, and its borders are marked by signs and central medians. The neighborhood was originally developed by Sanford Adler, the owner of the Flamingo Las Vegas and El Rancho Hotel and Casino, and included homes built by architects such as A. Quincy Jones. Filming locations Situated within a short drive of both Fox Studios and Sony Pictures Studios, the neighborhood has often been the site for the filming of motion pictures and television shows. Examples dating to the 1920s and 1930s include the Laurel and Hardy films The Finishing Touch, Big Business, and Bacon Grabbers, among others. Later examples include The Ropers television series from the late 1970s and the movie Private School in 1983. A house on Cheviot Drive was used in \\"The Flying Nun\\" starring Sally Field and a house on Glenbarr Avenue was the home of \\"Nanny and the Professor\\". On ABC-TV's \\"Modern Family\\" the exterior of a home on Dunleer Drive is seen as Claire and Phil Dunphy's residence. Government and infrastructure The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Cheviot Hills. Police service The Los Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station at 1663 Butler Avenue, 90025, serving the neighborhood. Education Raymond and Esther Kabbaz High School of Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de Los Angeles Sixty percent of Cheviot Hills residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high figure for both the city and the county. The percentages of residents of that age with a bachelor's degree or a master's degree were also considered high for the county. The schools near Cheviot Hills are as follows: * Overland Avenue Elementary School, LAUSD, 10650 Ashby Avenue * Vista School, private K‚Äì12, 3200 Motor Avenue * Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de Los Angeles Kabbaz High School Parks and recreation Club Circle Park Cheviot Hills features the Cheviot Hills Park, the Cheviot Hills Recreation Center, the Cheviot Hills Tennis Courts, and Rancho Park Golf Course. The park and recreation center have a community room which has a capacity of 80 to 100 people. In addition they have an auditorium, barbecue pits, a lighted baseball diamond, an unlighted baseball diamond, lighted indoor basketball courts, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, an indoor gymnasium without weights, picnic tables, and lighted volleyball courts. The Cheviot Hills Tennis Courts consists of fourteen lighted tennis courts. The Cheviot Hills Pool is an outdoor unheated seasonal pool in Cheviot Hills. On May 11, 2012, after a campaign fundraiser at the nearby home of actor George Clooney, President Barack Obama played a game of basketball at the Cheviot Hills Recreation Center with Clooney, actor Tobey Maguire and others. There are also two private country clubs in the neighborhood, both of them founded in response to then-prevailing membership discrimination at other Los Angeles clubs. Hillcrest Country Club was founded in 1920 as a country club for Jews, then largely excluded from other clubs. It features an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, and swimming pools. The Griffin Club, previously known as the Beverly Hills Country Club, was founded in 1926, and was originally intended for people working in the entertainment industry who, at that time, were also excluded by most Los Angeles clubs. It has tennis courts and swimming pools. In the past the neighborhood also contained the California Country Club, which was replaced by a development called California Country Club Estates in 1952. There is also a small park, Club Circle Park, in the heart of the neighborhood, and a playground, Irvine Schachter Park, on the outskirts. Notable residents *L. B.

In 1963, he was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death on charges of participating in President F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny's \\"complot du chat noir\\" (black cat conspiracy). Meanwhile, his office was transferred to Kouadio M'Bahia Bl√© whose ministership lasted more than 17 years. There was discontent in the army, as the generals stirred following his arrest and Houphou√´t-Boigny had to intervene personally to sedate the army.Le Vine, p. 211. Banny, who personally knew Houphou√´t-Boigny from childhood, was pardoned and released in 1967. He asked Banny to be the mayor of Yamoussoukro, though Houphou√´t- Boigny's successor, Henri Konan B√©di√©, appointed Banny as Resident Minister of the capital. The Resident Minister is a member of the Council of Elders of the PDCI, which includes roughly a hundred elders. He also directed the Soci√©t√© fruiti√®re du Bandama, an industrial company, which produces and exports fruit juice, mainly that of pineapples. The company created the popular drink Cristelor in 1983. Described as a delice d'ananas petillant, French for sparkling pineapple delight, it is popularly called pineapple champagne. Banny claimed the idea \\"came to [him when he thought] to make a wine from pineapples\\" and was named after his granddaughter Cristel. He also proposed an alcoholic version of the drink.

Role The wagon that leads the boys in the 151x151px Candlewick is introduced in chapter XXX of The Adventures of Pinocchio. His real name is Romeo, though he is given his nickname on account of his slender, polished build. He is described as the most unruly of Pinocchio‚Äôs class, though he is the puppet‚Äôs best friend. He refuses Pinocchio‚Äôs invitation to a party celebrating his upcoming transformation into a real boy, and persuades the puppet to instead come with him to the Land of Toys (Paese dei Balocchi), a place where the boys spend their days having fun, education and study are nonexistent. The holidays start on the first day of January and end on the last of December. Their laughter soon turns to animal brayings and the two transform into a pair of donkeys. The two are transported to the Land of Toys by the Coachman, and spend their days indulging in play and idleness. After five months, both of them awake with donkey ears, which they conceal with tall caps. The two are reluctant to admit their condition to each other, but after some coaxing, they simultaneously remove their caps and laugh at each other. Their laughter soon turns to animal brayings and the two transform into a pair of donkeys. While Pinocchio is sold to a circus ringleader, Candlewick is sold to a farmer who makes him work at a water mill. In a later chapter, Pinocchio is sold to a drummer who attempts to drown the donkey in order to skin his hide and use it to make his drum. The man is then surprised that instead of finding a dead donkey, he sees Pinocchio who says the fish ate away at all his donkey skin. Pinocchio recognizes the farmer's donkey as his friend Candlewick. Pinocchio and Candlewick meet again in chapter XXXVI, where it is revealed that Candlewick is dying from exhaustion. Pinocchio, now returned to normal, temporarily takes on Candlewick's job of doing farm work, and is laughed at when he reveals to Candlewick's owner that he went to school with the animal. Candlewick dies from exhaustion not long after. Adaptations The first Lucignolo (Candlewick) in cinema history was the French-Italian comedian Natalino Guillaume in Pinocchio (1911) directed by Giulio Antamoro, in a cast of adult actors, in which the character of Pinocchio was played by his brother Ferdinand Guillaume (Polidor).Pinocchio (1911) in Internet Movie Database. Candlewick then appeared in Walt Disney's 1940 animated adaptation, Pinocchio, be called like Lampwick. The first child actor to play the role of Lampwick was Guglielmo Selvaggio in '' The Adventures of Pinocchio directed by Giannetto Guardone in 1947.The Adventures of Pinocchio (1947) in Internet Movie Database. Lampwick appears in a 1972 Italian animated adaptation titled The Adventures of Pinocchio. He is portrayed like the original story: a lazy boy who dislikes school and convinces Pinocchio to come to the Land of Toys with him. They play many games and eat junk food and go on amusement rides. Eventually he and Pinocchio transform into donkeys and are sold to a farmer and a circus. Near the end of the film, Pinocchio finds Lampwick heavily wounded and exhausted from overwork at the farm and he volunteers to do his work until he feels better, but it is too late and Lampwick dies from his wounds. The character is voiced by Italian actress Flaminia Jandolo. In the 1972 television miniseries The Adventures of Pinocchio, director Luigi Comencini entrusted the part to Domenico Santoro, a kid he had \\"discovered\\" while shooting a documentary on child labor in Naples (I bambini e noi, 1970).Lorenzo Capulli and Stefano Gambelli (ed). I bambini del cinema: Luigi Comencini 1946-1991, Ancona, Aniballi, 1992. In the 1993 direct-to-video adaptation by GoodTimes Entertainment, where the character is voiced by Cam Clarke (who also voiced Flounder from \\"The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning\\"), Candlewick is portrayed like his Disney counterpart, Lampwick, with red hair (though he does not have buckteeth) who tries to have fun in Dunceland with Pinocchio. Like his Disney counterpart, he is transformed into a donkey and his fate is unknown. Lampwick appears in the 1996 film The Adventures of Pinocchio, portrayed by Corey Carrier as a boy whom Pinocchio meets at school and later convinces him to come with him to Terra Magica, where they are allowed to do whatever they please. Eventually, they and a few other boys (one of which is Lampwick's best friend Saleo) ride a roller coaster. During the ride, they are splashed with enchanted water which turns them into animals based on their nature. Lampwick, Saleo, and many of the other bad boys turn into donkeys, while Pinocchio only grows donkey ears. They are later corralled by Lorenzini, who fulfills the roles of both the Puppeteer and the Coachman. Pinocchio escapes and sets the other boys free. During their escape, the donkey Lampwick kicks Lorenzini into the sea, turning him into a whale. Close to the end of the movie, the donkey Lampwick is seen pulling Geppetto, Pinocchio and Leona on a carriage alongside the donkey Saleo. Lampwick, along with Saleo and the other donkeys, returns to human form by doing good deeds. He can be seen playing with the human Pinocchio before the end credits. Unlike in the novel and the 1940 Disney version, Lampwick truly becomes Pinocchio's best friend, and affectionately calls him \\"Woody\\" even after they have both become real boys. Lampwick appears in the 2002 feature film Pinocchio portrayed by Kim Rossi Stuart while his English dub voice was provided by Topher Grace. In the English version, he is named Leonardo. He first meets Pinocchio in prison after Pinocchio was cheated by the Fox and the Cat, teaching him what lollipop he licks, which is tangerine, and then they meet again after Pinocchio is kidnapped by a farmer in order to replace a dog that died. During that time, Lampwick attempts to steal chickens. Later, he entices Pinocchio to join him at the Land of Toys, where bad boys turn into donkeys. He turns into a donkey and is sold to a farmer. When Pinocchio goes to work for the same farmer after he and Geppetto escape from the Giant Shark, he finds Lampwick's donkey form dying from exhaustion. Lampwick appears in the 2008 Pinocchio miniseries, played by Thomas Sangster. The miniseries is more faithful to the book; Lampwick has a much bigger role than in the Disney film, and he dies toward the end. This also develops him somewhat more, as it implies (though fans of the book or various film versions may have analyzed him this way anyway) that his lawlessness and cynicism comes from having a horrible father, as he tells Pinocchio before he dies that if he had had a father like Geppetto, he may have turned out more like Pinocchio, and his loyalty to Pinocchio is very apparent too, although most versions do imply their bond is quite strong. Lampwick appears in the 2012 Italian animated film Pinocchio, voiced by Paolo Ruffini in the Italian and Noah Bernett in the English dub while also being renamed to Wickley. Like in the 1940 Disney version, his fate is left unknown after he is turned into a donkey. In the 2013 American animated web series RWBY one of the main antagonists, Roman Torchwick, alludes to Candlewick. The character's appearance is also based on the Disney version of the character, Lampwick, as they both have no respect for the law. In the live-action Italian film Pinocchio (2019), co-written, directed and co-produced by Matteo Garrone, Candlewick is portrayed by Alessio Di Domenicantonio. In the 2021 stop-motion Netflix film, Pinocchio that was produced, written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, Candlewick was voiced by Finn Wolfhard.  Disney  Candlewick appears in Walt Disney's 1940 animated adaptation of Pinocchio. He is given the alternate translation of his name, Lampwick, and is voiced by Frankie Darro as a human and Clarence Nash in his donkey form. His likeness is modeled after Disney animator Fred Moore, and like his literary version, he is tall and slender, and sports red hair and buck teeth. In the film, Lampwick befriends Pinocchio during the journey to Pleasure Island and leads Pinocchio astray by introducing him to such activities as fighting others, smoking, and drinking beer. Jiminy Cricket finds Pinocchio playing pool with Lampwick and the latter bullies him calling Jiminy a \\"grasshopper\\" and \\"beetle,\\" laughing at him after Jiminy threatens to fight him. Shortly after this altercation, Jiminy notices that the boys on Pleasure Island are literally turning into jackasses and being rounded up for slave labor. Lampwick's transformation is swift: within a minute, he loses all humanity (including his red hair and buckteeth) and is last seen wrecking the pool hall in panic. Lampwick began transforming before Pinocchio because was one of the worst-behaved boys on the island. Lampwick also makes a cameo in House of Mouse, as well as in Who Framed Roger Rabbit where he appears on a poster advertising for \\"exploding cigars\\" in Toontown, with his donkey ears from the original film. In live performance, Lampwick has often starred in Disneyland's Electrical Parade along with an unnamed boy from Pleasure Island, where Lampwick and the other boys have tails and donkey ears and wave to guests at Disneyland.

Steps in the marketing research process The first stage in a marketing research project is to define the problem. In defining the problem, the researcher should take into account the purpose of the study, relevant background information and all necessary data, and how the information gathered will be used in decision making. Problem definition involves discussion with the decision makers, interviews with industry experts, analysis of secondary data, and, perhaps, some qualitative research, such as focus groups. Once the problem has been precisely defined, the research can be designed and conducted properly. Development of an approach to the problem is the second step. This includes formulating an objective or theoretical framework, constructing analytical models, generating research questions, hypotheses, and identifying characteristics or factors that can influence the research design. This process is guided by discussions with management and industry experts, case studies and simulations, analysis of secondary data, qualitative research and pragmatic considerations. The third step involves the formulation of the research design which is the framework or blueprint for conducting the marketing research project. It details the procedures necessary in obtaining the required information, and its purpose is to design a study that will test the hypotheses of interest, determine possible answers to the research questions, and provide the information necessary for decision making. Conducting exploratory research, precisely defining the variables, and designing appropriate scales to measure them are also components of the research design. The issue on how the data should be obtained from the respondents must be addressed. It is also necessary to design a questionnaire and a sampling plan to select respondents for the study. Formulating the research design involves the following steps: # Secondary data analysis # Qualitative research # Methods of collecting quantitative data (survey, observation, and experimentation) # Definition of the information needed # Measurement and scaling procedures # Questionnaire design # Sampling process and sample size # Plan of data analysis Fourth is data collection which involves manpower/staff members who operate either in the field, as in the case of personal interviewing (in-home, mall intercept, or computer-assisted personal interviewing), from an office by telephone (telephone or computer-assisted telephone interviewing), or through mail (traditional mail and mail panel surveys with pre-recruited households). Proper selection, training, supervision, and evaluation of staff members helps minimize data-collection errors. Data preparation and analysis is the fifth step and includes the editing, coding, transcription, and verification of data. Each questionnaire or observation form is inspected, or edited, and, if necessary, corrected. Number or letter codes are assigned to represent each response to each question in the questionnaire. The data from the questionnaires are transcribed or key-punched on to magnetic tapes, or disks or inputted directly into the computer. Verification ensures that the data from the original questionnaires have been accurately transcribed. Analyzed data gives meaning to the information that have been collected. Univariate techniques are used for analyzing data when there is a single measurement of each element or unit in the sample, or, if there are several measurements of each element, each RCH variable is analyzed in isolation. On the other hand, multivariate techniques are used for analyzing data when there are two or more measurements on each element and the variables are analyzed simultaneously. The last stage is the report preparation and presentation. The entire project should be documented in a written report and the results and major findings must be presented. The findings must be in a comprehensible format so that they can be readily used in the decision making process. In addition, an oral presentation should be made to management using tables, figures, and graphs to enhance clarity and impact. For these reasons, interviews with experts are more useful in conducting marketing research for industrial firms and for products of a technical nature, where it is relatively easy to identify and approach the experts. This method is also helpful in situations where little information is available from other sources, as in the case of radically new products. Primary data vs. secondary data Primary data is sourced by the researcher for the specific purpose of addressing the research problem. On the other hand, secondary data is collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand. This data includes information made available by business and government sources, commercial marketing research firms, and computerized databases. Secondary data is an economical and quick source of background information. Qualitative research Information, industry experts, and secondary data may not be sufficient to define the research problem. Sometimes qualitative research must be undertaken to gain a qualitative understanding of the problem and its underlying factors. Qualitative research is unstructured, exploratory in nature, based on small samples, and may utilize popular qualitative techniques such as focus groups (group interviews), word association (asking respondents to indicate their first responses to stimulus words), and depth interviews (one-on-one interviews which probe the respondents' thoughts in detail). Other exploratory research techniques, such as pilot surveys with small samples of respondents, may also be undertaken.

Now, as part of the charity UK Youth Marine Training Academy (YMTA), they provide an inshore rescue service and a land rescue service. It is manned by volunteers aged 12‚Äì21, and were established to show that teenagers, if given the training, equipment, opportunity and trust could provide a valuable service to the adult community. History The service was started by Mr Philip Gordon Pierce-Smith who no longer runs the service he started nearly 52 years ago, and was started on limited funds and equipment, patrolling Poole Harbour with a small prototype Deep V soft bottom hulled inflatable developed by David Doderell of SWMF in Poole. It proved to be a fantastic hull until the bottom stretched or the wooden keel snapped. The crews had RAF lifejackets and anoraks, navigation was done with a AA road map and handheld compass, a far cry from the current standards. Since then the service has developed, seeing many different rescue boats and hundreds of crew. The League of Venturers evolved over years thanks largely to a substantial legacy and ongoing support from the public and private persons and the purchase of two Ocean Dynamics waterjet RIBs played a big part in this, however the larger 40 foot cabin RIB had to be sold in late 2005. It was replaced with a Humber Ocean Pro 6.3 that provided a training platform for the Venturers in the waters of the Solent. Lepe Inshore Rescue, under YMTA, is part of an educational facility that teaches teenagers in all aspects of the marine-based environment, with a view to not just serving the community but improving employment prospects. They can be called upon by the coastguard to attend incidents, and in 2009 the organization attended 90 incidents at sea - double the amount from previous years and are still assisting mariners today. The mostly sea-based training and operations are undertaken from a purpose built control room next to the old coastguard cottages at Lepe Beach, overlooking the Western Solent and the Beaulieu River. The control room is fully equipped with charts, radio, direction finding equipment and radar. The land based events and training run out of our Gangwarily HQ a few miles in land. The premises are also where we store our vehicles and work is undertaken in the workshop at Gangwarily, complete with pit and full set of tools / parts.

He was instrumental in the creation of the Detroit Metropolitan Police Commission and the construction of the first Detroit House of Corrections. When Bagley died in 1881, his will contained $5,000 for the construction of a drinking fountain for the people of Detroit, having \\"water cold and pure as the coldest mountain stream.\\" Fountain In 1885, the Bagley family chose Henry Hobson Richardson to design the fountain.Jeffrey Karl Ochsner, H.H. Richardson, Complete Architectural Works, MIT Press, 1982, , p. 400. In 1887, the Bagley Memorial Fountain was dedicated at the corner of Woodward Avenue and Fort Street. Richardson constructed the fountain entirely out of pink Bragville granite, modeled after a ciborium located in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. The Bagley Memorial Fountain stands 21 feet high with a basin 7 feet across. At the center of the fountain, four lion heads distribute water. In the original design, two of the heads produced \\"normal\\" temperature water and the other two produced cold water, chilled by ice packed around the fountain pipes.

It is often found growing in small groups on wood debris, or in leaf litter, during summer and autumn in Europe, Asia, and eastern North America. It is not generally considered edible, although there are reports of the immature 'eggs' being consumed. Taxonomy The genus name Mutinus was a phallic deity, Mutinus Mutunus (known to the Greeks as Priapus), one of the Roman di indigetes placated by Roman brides, and caninus means \\"dog-like\\" in Latin. Mutinus is the diminutive of muto, a Latin word for Penis. It was described initially by William Hudson (1730‚Äì1793), a noted British botanist. Its common names in French, Phallus de Chien, Satyre des chiens, also hint at its resemblance to a dog penis. It is commonly known as the \\"dog stinkhorn\\". Description Cross section of the immature 'egg' This small member of the family Phallaceae emerges from an off-white egg-like fruiting body that lies half buried in leaf litter on the woodland floor. White mycelial cords (rhizomorphs), are often visible beneath this 'egg', which is high, and wide. The 'egg' has a tough outer skin (peridium), which covers a gelatinous inner layer, which in turn protects the fully formed, but unexpanded fruiting body. When the ‚Äòegg‚Äô splits open the fungus expands rapidly (usually within a few hours), to its full height of . It is around thick, and is either yellowish- white, yellow, or pale orange. The split egg is retained as a volva-like sack, at the base. The column is very fragile, pitted, and cylindrical. It has a pointed tip, and is usually curved. The tip is covered in the spore bearing matter (gleba) which is a dark olive-brown paste, and has a smell which is irresistible to insects. (These insects help distribute the spores on their bodies, and in their stomachs.) Beneath the spore mass the tip is dark orange. Although its smell is not as strong as the related common stinkhorn (Phallus impudicus), it has been described as smelling like cat faeces. American mycologist Sanford Myron Zeller described an albino form of the fungus based on collections made in Warrengon, Oregon. It is essentially identical to the regular form but pure white throughout, except for the gleba. This form, named M. caninus var. albus, was first mentioned in the scientific literature by Edward Angus Burt in 1896. Similar species Mutinus ravenelii is pinker in coloration, with a red tip. It is a rarer American species, now spreading in Europe. Another North American species Mutinus elegans is very similar to M. ravenelii, and is short and stocky, with a more pointed apex. Distribution and habitat The dog stinkhorn is found occasionally, and is quite common in Europe, Britain, and Eastern North America. The fungus is listed in the red data list of the Ukraine. A collection from the Canary Islands was noted as the southernmost collection for the species in the Northern Hemisphere. It has also been collected in Iran, Turkey, and China, including Hebei, Jilin, and Guangdong. It appears from summer to late autumn, and is usually found in small groups; in leaf litter; on wood debris, or wooded roadsides. It may occur in both deciduous, and coniferous woods. The fruit bodies of the fungus can serve as a food source for thief ants and developing blow flies (Phormia regina). Edibility The dog stinkhorn is probably edible at the ‚Äòegg‚Äô stage, but it is not recommended. At least one report from in the eastern United States strongly recommends the 'eggs' peeled and fried as a tasty dish.

Vijayapuram is characterized by its multiple specialties. It comprises the entire civil districts of Kottayam, Idukki and partial portions of the districts of Alleppey, Pathanamthitta, and Ernakulam. Many factors facilitated the formation of this diocese. The presence of Roman Catholics in this area is due to rapid migration from within and outside the state. The first phase of the migration started in the middle of the 18th century when Latin Catholics from the Diocese of Cochin came to Vaisiambhagom, Nedumudy, Kanjpadam and its vicinities. The second phase began at the first half of the 19th century, when people from different parishes of Quilon reached Maramon, Ranny, Vanavathukkara, Thiruvalla, Changanacherry and Poovam. The third phase started by the second half of the 19th century when the high ranges of the eastern side began to be used for cultivation tea. People from Verapoly, Cochin and from different parts of Tamil Nadu settled down in this area for different jobs. The arrival of Brother Rockey Palackal, OCD, at the end of the 19th century geared upon the fourth phase of the history of the Diocese of Vijayapuram. Brother Rockey, as a zealous father, worked hard in Kottayam, Thellakom, Chengalam and Kumarakom and preached the Good News to the native people. He opted to serve the poor, sidelined, marginalized and downtrodden and thus secured the name \\"Apostle of the Outcastes\\". The area Church work of the Archdiocese of Verapoly entrusted to the Carmelites was created to be the Diocese of Vijayapuram. The administration was in the hands of the Carmelites of the Navara Province.

Early career in India Nathan was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, before joining the Indian Civil Service in 1888. He was appointed secretary of the Indian Universities Commission in 1902, and Private Secretary to the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, in 1905. In 1907 Nathan was made Chief Secretary to the Government of Eastern Bengal and Assam, and Commissioner of Dhaka Police. In 1908, Nathan, then the Police Commissioner of Dhaka, was responsible along with the district collector H.L. Salkeld for uncovering the revolutionary organisation of the Anushilan Samiti, and for instituting the measures to suppress the organisation. Return to Britain Nathan was appointed Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1914, and the same year returned from India on account of ill-health. He began his work for British intelligence against Indian revolutionaries in October 1914. After retiring from the ICS in 1915, Nathan joined the MI5's section dealing with the Indian seditionist movement in Europe, called MI5(g), that was formed at the time headed by Vernon Kell. Nathan's fellow officer at the time was another ex- Indian police official, H.L. Stephenson. He headed at the time the political branch of the Secret Service, and along with Basil Thomson who headed the Special Branch of the Scotland Yard, Nathan was closely involved in the interrogation of Indians who worked along with the Germans during the war. Nathan's efforts, along with those of John Wallinger's Indian Political Intelligence Office (with whom Nathan worked closely), were key in the British counter-espionage work. Nathan identified plans by Ghadar Party and the Berlin Committee to assassinate Lord Kitchener in 1915 through an associate of Har Dayal, Gobind Behari Lal. He was also responsible at this time, along with Basil Thomson, to turn Harish Chandra (who was associated with the Berlin committee) into a double agent. Nathan was also responsible for the plans made by British intelligence in late 1915 to assassinate Virendranath Chattopadhyaya through agent Donald Gullick. Work in North America Later, on instructions from British secret service, Robert Nathan transferred to the Pacific coast of North America where the Ghadar Party worked closely with the German consulate at San Francisco to obtain arms and men for what came to be known as the Ghadar Conspiracy. Nathan successfully brought the Ghadarites and staff at the German consulate to trial following the Annie Larsen arms plot. He organised the Hindu-German conspiracy trial, which at the time was the longest in American legal history. He was responsible for the arrest of Chandra Kanta Chakraverty and his subsequent interrogation, along with that Ernst Sekunna. Through March 1917, Nathan worked closely with William Wiseman, and negotiated with the US State Department the details of the case against the Indian conspirators. He strongly supported granting a guarantee to the United States not to be held responsible for violation of neutrality. Later life Nathan returned to Britain at the end of World War I where he died in 1921. NotesReferences *Dictionary of Indian Biography.

History Published under the pay-off \\"Y - because I want to know\\", the magazine was targeted to tap into the market that made YFM the biggest regional station at the time. This was what was referred to as the Y Generation, a \\"freedom's children\\" that got to celebrate the freedom of an apartheid-free South Africa. As poet Lebo Mashile explained: > \\"if we were 20 or 30 in the 1970s and 1980s we would have been using > everything we had to fight Apartheid... but now we have the freedom and > space to do what we want with our talent and we have the ability to really > manifest our dreams...\\" Under founder editors S'busiso 'The General' Nxumalo and Itumeleng Mahabane, Y quickly came to encapsulate this spirit of freedom of expression. Like YFM, its emphasis was on urban street culture with a strong focus on the sounds of post-apartheid black South Africa especially Kwaito. Written in spoken English and drops of Scamto, it was filled with diverse youth interests without ever narrowing them down to just entertainment. From the relationship between kwaito's apolitical, \\"hedonistic and flighty preoccupations\\", to President Thabo Mbeki's macroeconomic ideology, and to the politics of fashion and the aesthetic of struggle, this publication is very well rounded. This radical challenge to the binary opposition of political/apolitical placed Y a step or two ahead of other mainstream magazines, intended for both black and white audiences. This also meant that corporate advertisers remained at arm's length. Inevitably the magazine gave over to market pressures and changes at the radio station. Both Nxumalo and Mahabane stepped down as editors. Since then Y has continued under no less than eight different editors but it has never recaptured the idealism or attitude of those first few issues.

It was first described by Jacob H√ºbner in 1799 and it is found throughout Europe and in North Africa. Description The wingspan is 12‚Äì26 mm. (1st generation); the next generation is typically much smaller and reaches no more than 18 mm. The forewing leading edge (costa) forms an acute angle with the outer edge forming a sharp point. The hindwings also come to a sharp angle in the middle of the outer edge (a \\"tail\\"). The pattern and colouring are variable. The wings are reddish, yellowish or orange to light brown. The lines and marginal line are almost always clear, but fine. The median crossline is clearly developed and inclined slightly diagonally to the inner and outer crossline. It is slightly curved and very weakly wavy and often accompanied by a distal facing shadow. The interior and exterior crosslines are slightly wavy (more clearly than the median line). The hindwings have the pattern, however they often lack the inner crossline. The outer cross line shows a pointed bulge outwards, which follows the \\"tail\\" of the perimeter. Discal flecks are only sometimes present or weak, They are more pronounced on the hindwing. The discal fleck of the hindwings sits on the outside of the medium line or in the \\"shadow\\". On the forewing it is basal to the median line. Distribution The species is mostly southern European (from Portugal to the Balkan peninsula and Greece) as well as North African (from Morocco to Libya). It ranges in the east to Asia Minor and Syria. It also occurs in almost the whole of France to the south of the British Isles and Denmark. Also specimens have been caught in southern Germany. There are small, isolated occurrences in western Ukraine. In Germany, there are but so far no secure evidence of an indigenous population. In the Middle East, in southern Turkey, Cyprus, Crete and the Greek islands of the south-east, the nominate S. i. imitaria is replaced by S. i. syriaca Culot, 1918. This form is less clearly has a little less corrugated outer cross line and a less clearly pronounced marginal line. The colour is slightly reddish. The reddish yellow form S. i. syriaca occurs especially on hot, dry areas in the lowlands and hills. It is widespread in the Mediterranean region on sandy or stony soil, the maquis shrubland, evergreen oak forests, olive groves and rocky grassland. In the Alps S. i. imitaria rises up to 900 m. In Morocco and also in the Mediterranean region it rises up to a height of 1,400 meters. S. i. imitaria is limited to the coastal areas in western France and southern England. The moth flies in two generations from June to September in western Europe. The larvae feed on various forms of privet.

Themes emphasised include pre-colonial and colonial history, inter-group relations, the Aro and the slave trade, the art and science of history in Africa, and nation-building. Afigbo took up his career as a historian in the 1950s with the celebrated Ibadan School of History, which for about three decades was the most prominent school of history in Africa. He became a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to demonstrating the need for African history and historiography as specific genres of the world history. In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching and scholarly work, Afigbo produced works that established reconstructionist history, of African historical methodologies, and links between history and statecraft. He gave rein to eclecticism of sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth, oral sources, from archaeology, linguistics, material artefacts and written sources. In the last analysis he defined a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it.  Early life and education  Afigbo was born at Ihube, Okigwe, in present-day Imo State. His formal education began in 1944 at Methodist Central School, Ihube where he came under the influence of remarkably dedicated teachers, the most outstanding of whom was Mr. Oji Iheukumere, the head teacher, a native of Uzuakoli, in today's Abia State who was a noted church musician and disciplinarian. At Ihube Central School Afigbo's brilliance manifested early which made his teachers encourage him to go to secondary school in spite of the opposition of his parents who were intimidated by the cost of post-primary education. He succeeded in his bid and went to St. Augustine's (CMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre Orlu in Imo State. with an Okigwe Native Administration scholarship won in a competitive examination. There again he came across a crop of teachers who left a definite imprint on him. Foremost among those were Mazi F,C. Ogbalu, a teacher of Igbo language and culture and the founder of the Society for The Promotion of Igbo Language and Culture, C.G.I. Eneli a history graduate of the University College, Ibadan and E. C. Ezekwesili, the principal of the college and a history graduate of the University of Southampton, UK. These three helped to determine his future academic career. From St. Augustine's Grammar School Afigbo gained admission to study history at University College, Ibadan (then affiliated with University of London), with a scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria. There again, he met scholars noted for their brilliance and beneficent influence ‚Äì J.D. Omer-Cooper, J.C. Anene, J.F. Ade Ajayi and Kenneth Onwuka Dike. There were also his colleagues ‚Äì Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read history with him, but with him went on to pioneer the \\"made in Nigeria PhD\\" at the infant University of Ibadan with the help of post-graduate scholarships awarded by the university to the best graduating students. Adiele Afigbo had not only graduated top of his class, but also was the first among his colleagues to complete his PhD With this, he became the first person ever to receive a doctoral degree from a Nigerian university.  Early career  On obtaining the PhD, Afigbo was appointed a lecturer in history, a position he held for two years before fleeing to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in the wake of the Nigerian civil war. During the duration of hostilities, he served in the Directorate for Propaganda of the Ministry of Information, Republic of Biafra. He resumed his interrupted academic duties after the war, and rose on the academic ladder ‚Äì from Lecturer to Professor in 1972, thus reaching the top of his profession after only five years. A year after attaining to professorship, he was appointed the Head of the Department of History and Archaeology. The year after, he became also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. On more than one occasion he held the Directorship of the Leo Hansbury Institute of African Studies. He held the following public appointments among others ‚Äì pioneer Director of Research at the National Institute for policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos; Commissioner first for Education and then for Local Government in the Government of Imo State; Chairman of the Michael Okpara College of Agriculture, Umuagwo in Imo State and Sole Administrator of the Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri. He has also was awarded an Honorary Member of the Historical Association of Great Britain, Fellow of the Historical Society of Nigeria, the Nigerian National Order of Merit, the Fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Letters. His traditional chieftaincy titles include Ogbute-Okewe-Ibe, Ogbuzuo, and Olaudah.  Work as historian  Afigbo was a historian of Africa, of Nigeria, of Southeastern Nigeria, and finally a historian of the Igbo. He was a political historian, an economic and social historian, and of historiography. Myth, History and Society, one of the three volumes of his essays edited by Toyin Falola is devoted to theorising on the methods of doing history in Africa, on the sources of history in Africa, on the place and purpose of history in Africa and other related issues. In many publications he sought to use the particular to illuminate the universal, and the universal to illuminate the particular. Thus, for instance, he used a detailed study of the textile process in Southern Nigeria to throw much helpful light on the socio-cultural dynamics of the societies of the region. In a similar manner he used the rise and expansion of the pre-colonial great states such as Benin to show that the so-called segmentary societies as well as the so-called mini-states of pre- colonial Africa are, among other things, fossilised reminders of the conditions from which the great states arose. Afigbo broke away from the action-reaction thesis that ruled the new African historiography when he joined the history profession. He did so by emphasising in his works basic reconstructionist history, the study of peoples and cultures in their own right.  Death  Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo died in Enugu, Nigeria in the early hours of Monday, 9 March 2009 after a brief illness.

It was described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It is found throughout Europe. Distribution A typical temperate to boreal Palearctic species. In Europe it ranges from the west coast of France and the British Isles to the Urals. In the north it extends from central Scandinavia, south to central Italy and south Bulgaria. This latter occurrence is isolated from the main populations and is limited to higher regions. There are also isolated, very much small occurrences in northern Portugal and north-eastern Spain, as well as evidence in Corsica and Sardinia. However, these findings must still be confirmed. Outside Europe the species spreads east across the Caucasus, Kazakhstan, southern Siberia, Mongolia and the Russian Far East and Sakhalin. The species is moisture loving and is therefore found in humid forests, swamps, bogs, wet meadows and along rivers. In the Alps and southern Europe it rises up to , rarely even higher (max. 1,850 meters). Description The wingspan is . The length of the forewings is . The second generation in the south and moths in the north of the range can reach only . The ground colour is silk white with yellow dusting of varying intensity (particularly in the males). Drought and high temperatures during the development of the pupae induce more yellowish moths with pronounced pattern. The wavy crosslines are yellowish, ochreous to light brown in colour (with a fine scattering of black scales). Typically there are four crosslines and a wavy marginal line (often wide and blurred). Discal flecks are always present, but they can be much weaker on the front wings. Marginal stains are occasional, and then quite small and inconspicuous. It is similar to Scopula floslactata, but can be distinguished by its more rounded forewings and black discal spot. The moth flies in one generation from June to August in western Europe. The larvae feed on meadowsweet and valerian. ReferencesExternal links * *Lepiforum e.

Among his credits are showrunner and co-creator of Nickelodeon's preschool series Blue's Clues and director and producer of the feature film Keith. Career According to author Malcolm Gladwell, who wrote about Blue's Clues in his book The Tipping Point, Kessler worked for Sesame Workshop's \\"Sesame Street\\", but found traditional children's television too static and not visual enough. In 1993‚Äì94, Kessler, who was then a freelance producer for Nickelodeon, was assigned to work with Peter Schreck on his seminal interactive television experiments in the network's Orlando studio, developing concepts which were later incorporated into Blue's Clues. Kessler was the first creator involved with the show. Angela Santomero and Traci Paige Johnson were brought later on to complete the Blue's Clues team. Blue's Clues, according to Variety, was \\"at the forefront of a revolution in kids TV\\" and was crucial to the growth of Nickelodeon. The innovative and interactive format it created changed children's programming, including its most important influence Sesame Street, which changed its format in 2002 to be more interactive. Kessler left Nickelodeon and Blue's Clues in June 2000 after three seasons, but would continue to be credited as an executive producer for the rest of the show's run, as well as for all the show's spin-offs. In 2008, Kessler acquired the teen romantic drama Keith, a film adapted from a short story written by Ron Carlson. The film, which starred Jesse McCartney and Elisabeth Harnois, was Kessler's directorial debut. Kessler also produced and co-wrote (with David Zabel) the film, which \\"concerns a 17-year-old who thinks she's got it all figured out until she falls for a guy who has nothing to lose\\". Kessler is an outspoken critic of the popular belief that young children have short attention spans. In a column he penned for USA Today in its Oct. 26, 2015 edition, he referred to his own experience launching Blues Clues and the television industry resistance to the series due to the prevailing belief that its unique long-form narrative structure would not succeed with children. He also argued that children would also be engaged with picture books that featured more prose than current publishing industry standards. He wrote similar sentiments in an op-ed he wrote for Forward Reviews, a literary review magazine. Kessler authored the children's picture book The Good Dog in 2015 and The Good Dog and the Bad Cat in 2016. The books feature long-form narrative storytelling with complex characters and villains, following the adventures of Tako, a dog, and his owner, Ricky Lee; the second volume introduces Allie, a stray cat. Both books are published by Coralstone Press and illustrated by Jennifer Gray Olson. Howard Lavoy, executive editor at Forward Reviews, wrote The Good Dog series is \\"long form and engaging for kids and their grownups.\\" In addition, Kessler directed the romantic/musical film Bazodee, released on August 5, 2016 and starring Machel Montano, Natalie Perera, Staz Nair and Kabir Bedi. The story revolves around the complications created when Anita Panchouri (Perera) tries to sacrifice her own needs for the needs of her family. The movie, filmed on location in Trinidad and Tobago, features soca music and is praised for its authentic cast of Indians and Trinidadians and cultural accuracy, with Film Journal International's David Noh comparing it to Black Orpheus. Billboard has also compared the movie to The Harder They Come and Prince's Purple Rain because of Montano's musical performances, bringing soca to a wider audience. Awards and nominations As producer for Blue's Clues, Kessler received a Peabody Award, two Television Critics Association Awards in 1997‚Äì1998 and 1998‚Äì1999, several Parents' Choice Awards, and a New York Film Festival CINE Golden Eagle in 1996. He has also been nominated for six Emmys. \\"Keith\\" won first place in the teenage sections of five international film festivals: Italy's Giffoni Film Festival (in the 15‚Äì19-year-old division); the Toronto International Film Festival for Children and Youth (their Students Choice Award, decided on by high school students); Sweden's BUFF International Film Festival for Youth and Children; Germany's SCHLINGEL International Film Festival; and Quebec's Carrousel international du film de Rimouski.

It was designed to bring economies of scale through uniform vessel design, and ensure a degree of certainty about vessel capability once at sea, and was applied to all vessels from the first-rate to the fifth-rate. Once in effect, it superseded the 1706 Establishment, which had specified major dimensions for ships of the second-rate, third-rate and fourth-rate only.Lavery 2003, p. 75 The new Establishment in 1719 was not simply limited to specifying the overall dimensions of each type of warship, but now set out in great detail other factors used in constructing the ship, down to the thickness of timbers (\\"scantlings\\") used in construction and planking. The Establishment adopted in 1719 was subject to substantial revisions in both 1733 and 1741, although on neither occasion was the 1719 Establishment replaced. A new Establishment was finally adopted in 1745. Before the 1745 centralised all design work in the office of the Surveyor of the Navy, the design of every vessel was the responsibility of the Master Shipwright in the dockyard in which that vessel was built; thus ships built to one Establishment has to conform to the dimensions and other measurements specified by that Establishment, but were to varying designs and therefore did not constitute a \\"class\\" in the modern use of the term. The exception to this was when ships were built under contract by commercial shipbuilders, for which a common design was prepared by the Surveyor and copies sent to the shipbuilder for execution; this only applied to some of the two-decker ships and smaller vessels (all three-deckers were built or rebuilt in the Royal Dockyards), and was almost exclusively a wartime occurrence. Background When the 1706 Establishment had been introduced, British naval architecture had entered a period of highly conservative stagnation. The Establishments were intended to create standardisation throughout the fleet, in part to reduce the cost of maintaining Britain's large navy. The side effect was to almost completely eliminate any design innovation until the abolition of the Establishments in the early 1750s. When King George I ascended the throne in 1714, thus beginning the Hanoverian dynasty in Great Britain, the main institutions of the Royal Navy ‚Äì the Board of Admiralty and the Navy Board ‚Äì underwent the typical reorganisations associated with a change of r√©gime. While the Admiralty became a much more political body, the Navy Board became populated by men who had learnt their trade during the formative years of the Establishment system. A very significant factor in the formation of the 1719 Establishment and its subsequent longevity is that the period of 1714‚Äì1739 was the most peaceful of the 18th Century. A further contributory factor was the introduction of a new Establishment of Guns in 1716. Previously, gun establishments had catered for each ship, as there were often differences between ships of the same nominal size that would affect the armament they could carry. The 1716 gun establishment was intended to overturn that situation, so that all ships of a particular type (for example, 70 gun ships) would carry the same armament. The Navy Board highlighted the fact that there were still several ships in service that were physically incapable of carrying the prescribed armament, either due to the number and disposition of gunports, or to sturdiness of build. Essentially, however, the Navy Board resolved to undertake the task of having all ships rebuilt to common designs to facilitate the new gun establishment. 1719 arrangements The new Establishment of dimensions, finalised in December 1719, was significantly more detailed than its predecessor. The 1706 Establishment had sought to constrain only the basic dimensions (gundeck length, keel length, breadth, and depth in the hold), whereas the 1719 Establishment detailed everything from the keel length to the thickness of planks on each deck. The new Establishment was also expanded in scope to include first rates, the dimensions for which were to be based upon . In the other direction the new Establishment expanded down to include the sixth rates and the smaller (30-gun) fifth rates, so that all ships with 20 guns or more were covered. The dimensions for other ship types were adjusted according to experience with ships built to the 1706 Establishment.Lavery 2003, pp.7879 1733 proposals and revisions Over time, as British shipbuilding remained stagnant, Britain's foreign maritime rivals, most notably France, continued developing their own ships so that eventually the Navy Board was forced to take note. British ships by comparison with their foreign counterparts were usually significantly smaller ‚Äì a practice that had come about through a combination of various factors differentiating the role of the Royal Navy from that of the continental navies, but a major factor was the need for a sizeable fleet, and the associated requirement to keep costs as low as practicable. However, by 1729 concerns were being expressed that the ships being built to the 1719 Establishment may be too small, and so a new ship, , and which was due for rebuilding, were built with slightly altered dimensions.Lavery 2003, pp. 8183 In 1732 the Admiralty decided to ask the Master Shipwrights in each of the Royal dockyards to report to them on how best they thought the ships could be improved. The responses, when they finally arrived, were conservative, offering only minor adjustments to certain dimensions. There was little agreement between the changes proposed, and no further progress was made until May 1733 when Sir Jacob Ackworth of the Navy Board ‚Äì the Surveyor of the Navy at the time ‚Äì proposed to the Admiralty some changes to the dimensions of the 50-gun and 60-gun ships, most notably an increase in breadth. The Admiralty accepted these proposals, and the ones that followed in later months for the other types, and these new dimensions became the effective new Establishment, though they never technically superseded the 1719 dimensions; there was no 1733 Establishment. Indications are that the Admiralty desired more far-reaching reforms than what was actually implemented, but due in part to the absence of anyone with practical shipbuilding knowledge on the Board, the Board of Admiralty lacked the ability to realise them. 1741 proposals and revisions The true state of British ship design became apparent with the start of the War of Jenkins' Ear. The capture of the Spanish 70-gun ship Princessa in April 1740 by three British 70-gun ships (, and ) took six hours of fighting despite one of Princessa's topmasts being missing. Her greater size (much closer to that of a British 90-gun ship than a 70) gave her stability that the British ships lacked, and her build quality allowed her to withstand the pounding from the three British ships for a long time.Lavery 2003, pp. 8486 By way of response to the now apparent individual inferiority of British ships over their opponents, a previously abandoned update to the gun establishment was called upon to increase the firepower of the ships. With heavier guns came the need for larger ships to carry them, and so Sir Jacob made a new set of proposals for increased dimensions‚Äîslightly less conservative this time around. Additionally, the new gun establishment made some changes to the types of ships that would be on the navy list in future. The 70-gun ships would become 64-gunners, albeit with heavier guns as compensation, and the 60-gun ships were to become 58-gun ships, again with heavier guns. No first rates were built to the dimensions of the 1741 proposals, but one ship of 74 guns and two of 66 were constructed. An additional side effect of the war was the collapse of the system of rebuilding. Until the outbreak of the war, it had been the practice to rebuild ships periodically, to maintain the size of the fleet without alarming parliament with requests for new ships. In reality, many of these rebuilds amounted to just that, with little or no timber from the original ship surviving into her rebuilt form. In some cases, ships would be dismantled years before they actually underwent the rebuilding process, but remained on the active list for the entire time. Rebuilding a ship was a lengthy process, more time consuming and more expensive than building a completely new one. The pressures of the war meant that for drydocks to be taken up for long periods of time whilst a ship was surveyed to determine what timber was reusable in the new ship, and what could find a use elsewhere in the dockyard, disassembled and then rebuilt was counter-productive. Ships intended to be sent to the West Indies for service in the war required the use of drydocks to have their hulls appropriately sheathed to combat such problems as shipworm, and other uses of the drydocks for servicing the fleet meant that rebuilds were given a low priority. It was at this time that the British practise of converting old ships to hulks for expanded storage space in harbours began, as instead of wasting effort and dockyard space on breaking up an old vessel that was still perfectly capable of floating, they were converted to serve the dockyards in this new capacity. Few rebuilds were started after 1739, and none at all were begun after 1742, although any that had been started were allowed to complete.Lavery 2003, p. 87 Individual ship types A different set of Establishment dimensions was defined for each size of ship, other than the smallest (i.e. the unrated) vessels. First rates of 100 guns The 1719 Establishment for first rates took as its model the highly successful Royal Sovereign as rebuilt in 1704 (the subsequent Royal William and Britannia rebuildings had been to the same design dimensions and set of scantlings when they were launched in 1719). Thus all three of these rebuildings should be taken as being \\"to the 1719 Establishment\\" even though they actually predated that standard. While no other first rates were built or rebuilt during the years between 1719 and 1733, the Royal Sovereign underwent a further rebuilding between 1723 and 1729. The 1733 revision made no changes to the tonnage, length or breadth of the first rate, and only increased the depth in hold by 6 inches. The 1741 revision substantively increased the dimensions to: * Tons burthen: 1999 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Only one first rate was built to the 1733 dimensions. The Victory was nominally a rebuilding of its predecessor of 1695, but this was strictly a legal fiction, as the old ship had been completely taken to pieces in 1721, and the new ship was not commenced until 1733. Following this ship, no first rate at all was built to the 1741 dimensions. Second rates of 90 guns The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships from the 1706 Establishment dimensions to those shown in the adjacent table. Five Second Rates were rebuilt from existing ships to this Establishment specification ‚Äì the Prince George in 1719‚Äì1723, the Union in 1718‚Äì1726, the Namur in 1723‚Äì1729, the Neptune in 1725‚Äì1730, and the Marlborough in 1725‚Äì1732. Two more were ordered to be rebuilt to this Establishment, but were actually completed to the revised 1733 dimensions. The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows: * Tons burthen: 1626 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Two second rates were rebuilt to the 1733 dimensions, although initially ordered to the original 1719 Establishment. The Duke was rebuilt in 1734‚Äì1739 and the Saint George in 1739‚Äì1740. Again, two more were ordered to be rebuilt to these dimensions, but were actually completed to the revised 1741 dimensions. The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to: * Tons burthen: 1678 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Two second rates were rebuilt to the 1741 dimensions, although initially ordered to the 1733 figures. The Ramillies was rebuilt in 1743‚Äì1749 and the Prince in 1743‚Äì1750. Third rates of 80 guns The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships (the smallest class of three-decker warships) as shown in the adjacent table. Seven 80-gun ships were rebuilt to this specification before 1733 ‚Äì the Lancaster in 1719‚Äì1722, Norfolk in 1718‚Äì1728, Cornwall in 1723‚Äì1726, Princess Caroline in 1724‚Äì1731, Humber in 1723‚Äì1726, Somerset in 1722(?)-1731 and Russell in 1729‚Äì1735. An eighth ship ‚Äì the Cumberland ‚Äì was completed to the 1733 dimensions. The Humber was renamed Princess Amelia in 1727 and was cut down a deck into a 66-gun ship in 1747‚Äì1748. The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows: * Tons burthen: 1400 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Two 80-gun ships were rebuilt to these dimensions ‚Äì the Boyne in 1736‚Äì1739 and Cumberland in 1734‚Äì1739. The Cumberland was cut down a deck into a 66-gun ship in 1747‚Äì1748. The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to: * Tons burthen: 1472 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: One ship (Culloden) was built to the 1741 dimensions for 80-gun ships, but during construction was cut down a deck and completed in 1747 as a 74-gun two-decker ship with the following armament: * Lower deck: 28 √ó 32-pounders * Upper deck: 28 √ó 18-pounders * Quarter deck: 14 √ó 9-pounders * Forecastle: 4 √ó 9-pounders Two ships (Devonshire and Lancaster) were built to the 1741 dimensions for 80-gun ships, but during construction were each cut down a deck and completed as 66-gun two-decker ships, each with the following armament: * Lower deck: 26 √ó 32-pounders * Upper deck: 26 √ó 18-pounders * Quarter deck: 10 √ó 9-pounders * Forecastle: 4 √ó 9-pounders Third rates of 70 (later 64) guns The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships as shown in the adjacent table. Eight 70-gun ships were rebuilt in 1717‚Äì1730 to these specifications ‚Äì the Edinburgh, Northumberland, Captain, Stirling Castle, Lenox, Kent, Grafton and Ipswich ‚Äì while four more were newbuilt, all at Deptford Dockyard ‚Äì Burford, Berwick, Buckingham, Prince of Orange (the last originally to have been named Bredah). The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows: * Tons burthen: 1223 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Another twelve 70-gun ships were built or rebuilt to the 1733 dimensions ‚Äì the Elizabeth, Suffolk, Essex, Prince Frederick, Nassau, Bedford, Royal Oak, Revenge, Stirling Castle, Captain, Monmouth and Berwick. The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to: * Tons burthen: 1291 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: The 1743 Establishment of Guns altered these ships from 70-gun to 64-gun, but with more powerful ordnance as set out in the table. Fourth rates of 60 (later 58) guns The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships as shown in the adjacent table. Three 60-gun ships were rebuilt to this specification during the early 1720s ‚Äì the Plymouth, Canterbury and Windsor ‚Äì while the Dreadnought underwent a major repair amounting to a rebuild and a fifth ship ‚Äì the Sunderland ‚Äì was replaced by new construction. In the late 1720s, six new 60-gun ships were rebuilt to replace obsolete 50-gun ships ‚Äì the Deptford, Pembroke, Tilbury, Warwick, Swallow and Centurion (the last-named to a somewhat broader specification), while the 60-gun Dunkirk was likewise rebuilt. A slightly lengthened ship ‚Äì the Rippon ‚Äì was built in 1730‚Äì1735. The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows: * Tons burthen: 1061 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Eleven vessels were initially built to this specification, including six built as replacements for obsolete 50-gun ships. These were the Weymouth, Worcester, Strafford, Superb, Jersey, Augusta, Dragon, Lion, Kingston, Rupert and Princess Mary. After 1739 another four were built ‚Äì the Nottingham and Exeter in the Royal Dockyards and the Medway and Dreadnought by contract. The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to: * Tons burthen: 1123 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Six ships were ordered to this specification ‚Äì the Canterbury, Sunderland, Tilbury, Princess Louisa, Defiance and Eagle. A seventh ‚Äì Windsor ‚Äì was built to a somewhat enlarged design. The 1743 Establishment of Guns replaced the 26 9-pounder guns on the upper deck by 24 12-pounder guns, reducing the vessel to a 58-gun ship. Fourth rates of 50 guns The 1716 Establishment of Guns for the smaller fourth rates had replaced the 12-pounder guns on their lower deck by 18-pounders, and the 6-pounders on their upper decks by 9-pounders; at the same time, it removed four of the smaller (6-pounder) guns from the quarterdeck, turning them from 54 to 50 guns. The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships as shown in the adjacent table. Fourteen vessels were rebuilt to this specification between 1718 and 1732 ‚Äì the Falkland, Chatham, Colchester, Leopard, Portland, Lichfield, Argyll, Assistance, Romney, Oxford, Greenwich, Falmouth, Salisbury and Newcastle. The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows: * Tons burthen: 853 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Eight ships were rebuilt to this specification in the Royal Dockyards ‚Äì the Gloucester, Severn, Saint Albans, Woolwich, Dartmouth, Guernsey, Antelope and Preston. Subsequently, four further vessels were newbuilt by commercial contract ‚Äì the Hampshire, Leopard, Sutherland and Nonsuch. The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to: * Tons burthen: 968 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Fourteen vessels were newbuilt by contract to a common design by the Surveyor's Office ‚Äì the Harwich, Colchester, Falkland, Chester, Winchester, Portland, Maidstone, Gloucester, Norwich, Ruby, Advice, Salisbury. Lichfield and a second Colchester (after the first was lost in 1744). A fifteenth vessel ‚Äì Panther ‚Äì was built to a local design at Plymouth Dockyard, and two others were also dockyard-built at Woolwich and Deptford to a lengthened design ‚Äì the Bristol and Rochester. Fifth rates of 40 guns The 1716 Establishment of Guns for the larger fifth rates had removed the four smaller guns from the quarterdeck and instead added a tenth pair of guns on the lower deck, turning them from 42 to 40 guns. However the lower deck guns were now 12-pounders instead of the former 9-pounders. Thirteen vessels were rebuilt to this specification ‚Äì the Hector, Anglesea, Diamond, Mary Galley, Ludlow Castle, Pearl, Kinsale, Lark, Adventure, Roebuck, Torrington, Princess Louisa and Southsea Castle. The 1733 revision made no change to the gundeck length of the 40-gun fifth rate, and actually reduced the keel length by 17 inches. It substantially increased the beam by 26 inches and the depth in hold by 6 inches as follows: * Tons burthen: 678 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: A prototype to this specification ‚Äì the Eltham ‚Äì was rebuilt in 1734‚Äì1736 at Deptford. Thirteen more ships were ordered from commercial contractors from 1739 onwards ‚Äì the Dover, Folkestone, Faversham, Lynn, Gosport, Sapphire, Hastings, Liverpool, Kinsale, Adventure, Diamond, Launceston and Looe. By the late 1730s it was evident to Admiralty that the 44-gun fifth rates were inferior vessels; too small to stand in the line of battle but too large and slow for general cruising.Marcus 1975, p. 8 To address some these defects the 1741 revision further increased the standard dimensions, to: * Tons burthen: 706 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Thirteen ships were built to these specifications, again all by contract ‚Äì the Anglesea, Torrington, Hector, Roebuck, Lark, Pearl, Mary Galley, Ludlow Castle, Fowey, Looe, Poole, Southsea Castle and Chesterfield. Three further ships followed a slightly amended design, with the depth in hold increased by a further 5 inches ‚Äì the Prince Edward, another Anglesea and Thetis. Fifth rates of 30 guns The 1719 Establishment made provision for a 30-gun fifth rate with a gundeck length of 114 feet, carrying (under the provisions of the 1716 Establishment of Guns) an armament of eight 9-pounders on the lower deck, twenty 6-pounders on the upper deck, and two 4-pounders on the quarterdeck, but no 30-gun ships were built to this Establishment and this obsolete type was soon to disappear. Sixth rates of 20 guns The 1719 Establishment for sixth rates took as its model the highly successful Dursley Galley built in 1719. It revised the dimensions of these ships from the 1706 Establishment dimensions to those shown in the adjacent table. Three sixth rates were newbuilt ‚Äì the Greyhound and Blandford as replacements in 1720 for lost vessels, and the Rye as replacement in 1727 for a discarded ship ‚Äì and seventeen others were rebuilt from existing ships to this Establishment specification ‚Äì the Lyme and Shoreham in 1720, Scarborough in 1722, Lowestoffe in 1723, Garland, Seaford and Rose in 1724, Deal Castle, Fox, Gibraltar, Bideford, Seahorse, Squirrel, , Flamborough and Experiment in 1727, and Phoenix in 1728. Two further 20-gun ships were rebuilt at Deptford to a slightly enlarged specification in 1732 ‚Äì the Sheerness and Dolphin ‚Äì with the beam increased to 30 ft 5in. The 1733 revision made no change to the gundeck length of the 20-gun sixth rate, and actually reduced the keel length by 9 inches. It substantially increased the beam by 26 inches from the 1719 dimensions and the depth in hold by 3 inches as follows: * Tons burthen: 430 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Two 20-gun ships were rebuilt at Deptford to the 1733 dimensions ‚Äì the Tartar in 1734 and the Kennington in 1736. In 1739‚Äì1740 another fourteen were ordered to be newbuilt by commercial contractors to a common design ‚Äì the Fox, Winchelsea, Lyme, Rye, Experiment, Lively, Port Mahon, Scarborough, Success, Rose, Bideford, Bridgewater, Seaford and Solebay. Two further vessels to a slightly enlarged design ‚Äì the Greyhound and Blandford ‚Äì were also built by contract in 1741. The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to: * Tons burthen: 498 bm * Length: (gundeck) (keel) * Beam: * Depth in hold: Fifteen ships were built, all by contract, to a common design and to these specifications ‚Äì the Lowestoffe, Aldborough, Alderney, Phoenix, Sheerness, Wager, Shoreham, Bridgewater, Glasgow, Triton, Mercury, Surprise, Siren, Fox and Rye. Again, two further vessels ‚Äì Centaur and Deal Castle ‚Äì were built to a slightly different design (without lower deck gun ports) while still meeting the same 1741 Establishment criteria, while a single vessel ‚Äì the Garland ‚Äì was built in 1745‚Äì1748 at Sheerness Dockyard to a somewhat longer design.

It was described by Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1781. It is found throughout Europe. Distribution Scopula marginepunctata occurs in Europe from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Ural mountains in the east. In the north, the range extends to the south coast of England, the southern Netherlands and the German Baltic Sea coast. However the species is missing in parts of northern Germany. There are isolated occurrences on Bornholm, Sk√•ne and the southern Baltic. In the south, the range extends in North Africa from Morocco in the west to Egypt. The distribution ranges from there further over the Middle East, Asia minor, the Caucasus, northern Iran, Central Asia and Mongolia. Description The wingspan is . The length of the forewings is . The second generation is often smaller and the moths reach only about 18 mm wingspan. Colour and wing pattern vary. The base colour is off- white to light brown, and the wings are strong dark over dusted with dark scales. In the Swiss Canton of Ticino darkened forms occur, which were formerly called subspecies insubrica. The pattern of the wing is dark grey to dark brown, depending on the ground colour. The interior cross line and median bands are usually little developed. The medium band is relatively wide, if present, but frequently washed out. The interior cross line is often reduced to a row of dots. Usually only the outer cross line is significantly developed and almost always very pronounced and jagged, the tips of the spikes are even darker highlighted towards the marginal field. The front edge itself may be slightly darker than the ground colour. In the marginal field, usually four to five tooth-shaped, slurred stains are present, two penultimate often characteristic close. The intensity of each cross line may be slightly different on forewings and hindwings. Marginal stains are usually present. Discal flecks are almost always present on the front as well as on the rear wings. In North Africa the subspecies Scopula marginepunctata argillacea replaces the nominate. It is light brown with relatively weak pattern. In the north of Iran, Central Asia and Mongolia, the subspecies Scopula marginepunctata terrigena occurs. It is slightly larger than the nominate with a wingspan. The marginal field and medium fields are wide and slightly dark brown in colour. Biology The moth flies in two generations from mid-May to September and the larva feeds on yarrow and mugwort.

The colouration is highly variable. It ranges from yellow brown, light brown, red brown and grey brown to grey. The forewings have several, mostly parallel, undulate crosslines. There is a prominent broad dark brown band in the median field comprising two distinct shades, the middle being greyer, the edges more ferruginous. In addition, the females are usually brighter yellowish than the males, but both sexes vary in tint. There is also a small apical streak. The hindwings are pale with faint crosslines.\\"Bruinbandspanner Scotopteryx chenopodiata\\". De Vlinderstichting. Retrieved May 15, 2019. Variations * ab. monodii Th.-Mieg is a dark form with both wings smoky above and beneath, median band very dark. Perhaps forms a local race in the north of England. * ab. grisescens Hormuz., from the alpine and subalpine regions of Bukovina, is probably similar to monodii but is much smaller than the type, grey brown, the postmedian line straighter than normal. * ab. unicolor Th.-Mieg has the forewing almost uniformly coffee brown, with the median band not darker. Rather frequent in the south of France. * ab. defasciata Rbl, founded on a unique aberration in the Capper collection has the antemedian line placed nearer the base than usual and the postmedian of both wings removed to less than 2 mm. from the distal margin. The median area of the forewing is thus extraordinarily broad and moreover it is of a uniform ground colour, not darkened. Ribbe has recorded under this name two examples from Andalusia with no darkened central area, but these should probably be referred to unicolor. * ab. violacearia Lambill is described as having the ground colour of the forewing pale yellow and the median band violaceous yellow and is said to be very rare in Belgium. * ab. medioprieta Ribbe is described as having the basal area of the forewing above darkened as well as the median. If this refers to the entire area proximally to the median band, it must be a striking form.

It was written by Joe Pokaski and directed by Sergio Mimica-Gezzan. The episode aired on September 29, 2008. Plot The episode opens with Angela Petrelli speaking with Sylar. She tells him that he is her son, stating that he knew all along he wasn't the son of a watchmaker. She tells him she gave him up for adoption, then calls in a woman named Bridget, who has the power to view the history and past of any object she touches, including who has touched it in the past. Sylar asks what she is going to do to him, and Angela tells him that she is going to feed him. The scene ends with Angela walking away down a corridor, and the familiar sound of Sylar splitting a skull open along with screaming. The next scene opens with Tracy Strauss freezing the petals on a flower. Nathan Petrelli waits impatiently for Tracy's arrival. Future Peter teleports into the room. Nathan asks him where his brother is, and Future Peter says he's looking for him. Nathan tells him about a phone message he received from Peter, with someone else's voice, warning him to be on the lookout for Future Peter. Tracy travels to New Orleans to learn more about Niki Sanders, and there the funeral is about to begin. Tracy discovers Niki lying in a coffin and is startled at their resemblance. She closes the coffin and turns to leave, only to find Niki's now-orphaned son Micah standing behind her. Bewildered, Micah mistakes Tracy for Niki at first, but quickly realizes Tracy isn't his mother and, after they have a talk, he decides to help her. He uses his powers on a laptop and discovers that Tracy and Niki were born on the same day, in the same hospital and with the same doctor: a man named Zimmerman. Micah gives Tracy a hug goodbye, which for Tracy is awkward; Tracy then leaves to meet Zimmerman in California, so she can find out more about her past and origin. The next scene opens with Knox, Flint, The German, and Jesse's body, which Present Peter is still inside. They walk into a bank, and begin robbing it. Flint scares the customers inside with his flame throwing ability, giving Knox strength. The German works on the combination to the safe, and Peter does his best to keep peace. On Level 5, Angela and Noah Bennet discuss his terms. He says he is back to re-imprison Knox, Flint, Jesse and the German. When Noah asks for his old partner, The Haitian, Angela says he is unavailable, and pairs him with Sylar instead. She sends Noah and Sylar to defuse the hostage situation at the bank. When the situation at the bank escalates, Bennet and Sylar arrive at the bank. During a heated discussion, Knox kills the German. The villains want to start killing people, but Peter, in Jesse's body, tries to stop them. Bennet enters the bank alone, making Sylar wait outside. Bennet prepares to apprehend Knox and Flint. The two get the upper hand on Bennet until Peter learns to control Jesse's power and pushes the two away with a loud scream. Suddenly time gets frozen by Future Peter. He releases the current Peter out of Jesse's body and invites Peter to come along with him to witness the future, and Peter agrees and they leave. When time returns to normal, Bennet thanks Peter (because he thinks Peter is still in Jesse's body), but the real Jesse says \\"Peter isn't here right now\\" and proceeds to attack Bennet. Sylar enters and uses his telekinesis to stop Knox from punching Bennet and to choke Jesse so he couldn't use his sound. Bennet arrests Flint and walks out of the bank. Sylar, however, is too tempted by the criminals' powers, and ultimately gives in to his \\"hunger,\\" locking all the doors so he can kill Jesse. With Sylar focused on Jesse, Knox takes the opportunity to escape. Hiro and Ando have a run-in with the Haitian while following Daphne. Hiro and Ando have a discussion with Daphne, who attempts to drive Hiro and Ando apart. Hiro and Daphne discover they can't use their powers anymore when the Haitian arrives. Hiro and Ando follow the Haitian, who gets the other half of the formula that could destroy the world from an unknown English-sounding woman. It is mentioned that the Haitian is now working for Angela, who wanted the formula closer to home. Hiro and Ando knock the Haitian out and get the formula, but Daphne manages to steal it from them. Hiro and Ando are unable to escape before the Haitian wakes up again. They are arrested and taken to Level 2 in the Company. Claire seeks advice from Meredith. They go to an empty shipping container, and when Meredith asks why she wants to learn how to fight, Claire replies that she \\"wants to help people.\\" Knowing that she is lying, Meredith \\"tortures\\" Claire by heating up the metal around them and reducing the level of oxygen until Claire admits that she wants to hurt Sylar for what he did to her. They return home where Sandra Bennet, after receiving a call from the school regarding Claire's whereabouts, confronts Meredith on how to raise Claire. Claire later discovers a box with files on super-powered people from her father (the same box Sylar went through in \\"The Second Coming\\") and sneaks away to track them down. In Africa, Matt Parkman continues his spirit walk with the strange native who has precognitive painting powers, similar to those of Isaac Mendez. The native reveals that he has painted Matt's life ever since he was a boy. They reach the native's house, and Matt is shown numerous paintings of himself, mostly beginning from when he discovered his powers. The native tells him that one painting has to change. The native paints over an image of Matt with a woman (who distinctly resembles Daphne, the speedster Hiro is currently confronting) and a baby that has no longer come to pass, replacing it with a scene where Matt grieves over a dead woman he holds in his arms. Matt later wants to know what this all means, and the native invites Matt into his house, where Matt takes a seat and he is seen eating something that the native has given him. Matt tells the native that he does not feel anything. The native gives Matt his Walkman and says this will help. Matt's eyes then turn white and his pupils vanish, as when the native and Isaac Mendez use their power. Matt then begins to learn about the future. Tracy arrives in California and visits Zimmerman at his home, where he mistakenly calls her \\"Barbara\\". Tracy corrects him, then asks if he knew her. Zimmerman replies \\"Know you? I created you.\\" At the company, Hiro and Ando are both in a cell, Flint is brought back to his cell, as is Sylar. Angela however refuses to give up on him and still believes Sylar can amount to something good. Bennet disagrees, and tells the Haitian that he is just trying to find Sylar's weakness, so he can eventually kill him.

It was written by Aron Coleite and directed by David Von Ancken. The episode aired on October 6, 2008. The title is a reference to a phrase from the Bhagavad Gita and was famously quoted by J. Robert Oppenheimer; \\"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\\" Plot Peter travels four years into the future with his future self, in order to learn what he can. To the horror of both Peters, Kaito's formula is now being used to administer adrenal power enhancements to ordinary people, some of whom are unable or unwilling to control their abilities. Future Peter tells Present Peter that people are coming after him because they believe he is a terrorist, and that they need to find Sylar because his ability of intuitive aptitude can help to understand the cause and effect of time travel, thereby enabling Present Peter to fix the problematic future. Not long after arriving in the future, the Claire of this future assassinates Future Peter. Because the Haitian is present, Future Peter cannot regenerate and dies. Present Peter flees, avoiding Claire's partner, The Haitian, and begins searching for Mohinder. Mohinder, whose mutation has progressed much further and is hiding alone in shadows, tries in vain to stop himself from informing Present Peter that Sylar is living in Costa Verde, as Peter reads his mind. Teleporting to Costa Verde and expecting a fight, Peter finds that a friendly Sylar has reassumed his former identity of Gabriel Gray, and is now raising his young son, Noah, in Claire's former home. A desperate Peter tries to steal Gabriel's ability, but is resisted, arguing that his power comes at the dangerous risk of a predatory appetite for 'understanding', which Gabriel himself now barely controls for the sake of his son. He reveals to Peter that they are brothers. In the present, Hiro and Ando are imprisoned in the Company's cell, arguing over their hurt feelings from Daphne's tactics. Matt Parkman, still on his \\"spirit walk,\\" has a vision of the same future as that which Peter is visiting, in which he and Daphne are raising Molly and an infant together. In the future, Peter convinces Gabriel to paint the future and see the coming devastation. Convinced, Gabriel finally teaches Peter his power by having Peter fix his watch; the same watch from the present time which he carries as a \\"scar\\". Gabriel regretfully tells Peter that he has his power now, and about the inevitable \\"hunger\\" which comes with it. Future Claire, Knox and Daphne show up to kill Peter, having learned his whereabouts from Molly. They hold Gabriel and Peter at bay by taking Gabriel's son, Noah, as a hostage, but when Knox accidentally kills the child, an enraged Gabriel beats Knox into submission and loses control of his radiation ability. Peter tries in vain to stop Gabriel before he explodes, reducing Costa Verde to nuclear waste, and killing over 200,000 people. Peter and Claire survive due to their regeneration powers, and Claire takes Peter back to the base. Daphne the speedster runs and manages to get back to Matt and Molly. Fatally wounded from the blast, she tells Matt that she \\"wasn't fast enough\\" before collapsing in his arms, fulfilling the image that Usutu has painted. Nathan, who in this future is the President and married to Tracy, attempts to reason with Peter, offering Peter the opportunity to read his mind to see if he's sincere. Peter nearly kills Nathan upon gaining a morbid curiosity of how Nathan's mind works due to Sylar's powers. Angry and horrified with himself, Peter stops short of cutting Nathan's head open and teleports back to the present Level 5, where he enters Sylar's prison cell for an angry confrontation, in which Sylar confirms that he is Peter's brother. In the present, Tracy attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. However, under advice from Linderman, Nathan flies in and saves her. Later, she shows Nathan her ability by freezing his glass. The two then kiss. Throughout the episode, Mohinder is researching a possible cure for the powers he's given himself, verbally lashing out at Maya. Mohinder's aggression continues to increase when he intervenes in a domestic dispute of his neighbors, beating the man. Later, Mohinder is attacked by the neighbor for sticking his nose where it doesn't belong. With a smile, Mohinder responds by dragging the man into his apartment. Hiro and Ando, finally resolving their differences, try to escape through a vent and are caught by the Haitian. Later, Angela Petrelli mentions that Hiro's father would have been disappointed with him for losing both portions of the formula, which can be used to give powers to anyone. A disheartened Hiro apologizes, only to have Ando proudly proclaim that Hiro will not rest until the formula is retrieved. Angela alludes to Hiro that he already has \\"the key\\" to doing this. The scene switches to Hiro and Ando in a graveyard, digging up Adam Monroe who, upon seeing Hiro, lunges at him. The episode ends with Adam saying; \\"Hiro, you son of a...\\". Reception This is one of the weakest Heroes episodes according to critics. The episode was given a score of D+ by The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 7.6 out of 10. Ratings In the 18-49 demographic, \\"I Am Become Death\\" earned a 4.0/9 ratings share. The episode was watched by 8.2 million viewers.

Stovall was arrested for carrying a fifth of whiskey in his back pocket, while jamming at the home of blues guitarist Roosevelt Holts, who lived in a dry county. Jewell Stovall, better known as Babe Stovall (October 14, 1907 - September 21, 1974), was an American Delta blues singer and guitarist. Stovall was born in Tylertown, Mississippi, United States, in 1907, the youngest of eleven children (thus his nickname \\"Babe\\"). He learned to play the guitar by the age of eight, and his guitar playing style was influenced by Tommy Johnson, whom he had met in Mississippi around 1930. In 1964, he relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he entertained on the streets, and in cafes and galleries of the French Quarter. Stovall frequently took young white musicians under his wing as apprentice performers, teaching them traditional country blues songs and guitar techniques. He variously played his guitar at the back of his neck, and hollered his song lyrics loudly for all in the vicinity to hear. In 1964 he recorded an album for Verve, titled Babe Stovall (which was re-released in 1990 on CD), and undertook more recordings in 1966, released as The Babe Stovall Story. His later work with Bob West resulted in The Old Ace: Mississippi Blues & Religious Songs, which was released on Arcola (2003). He was credited by some as the character inspiration behind Jerry Jeff Walker's, \\"Mr. Bojangles\\". Stovall played on the college circuit, in addition to being the regular musician at the Dream Castel Bar on Frenchman Street, and The Quarum club in New Orleans. His death in 1974 was by natural causes.

Description Seeps are usually not of sufficient volume to be flowing beyond their above-ground location. They are part of the limnology-geomorphology system. Like a higher volume spring, the water is only from underground sources. Seeps mostly occur in lower elevation areas because water runs downhill, but can happen higher up if the groundwater present is abundant enough. Along with natural seeps, man made seeps can occur by digging anywhere where there is wet ground. This method can be useful for survival purposes and helps the local wildlife by adding another water source to the area. Seeps often form a puddle, and are important for small wildlife, bird, and butterfly habitat and moisture needs. When they support mud-puddling many butterfly (Lepidoptera) species can obtain nutrients such as salts and amino acids, including some types that are endemic endangered species. Environmental technology Seep is often used in environmental sciences to define an exfiltration zone (seepage zone) where contaminated water, e.g., from waste dumps, leaves a waste system area. Seeps are often important smaller wildlife water sources, and indicated by lower riparian vegetation. Stream recharge system Seeps can also contribute to streams. If a stream is flowing below a water table then the stream receives contributions from the ground water via seepage. This allows for a drainage of the ground water along with creating a more substantial stream to flow. The seep could be especially effective during a rain less period of the area in which the seep can actually prolong the stream‚Äôs flow by adding water from the groundwater.

Powered by a 90 hp Thulin A Gn√¥me derived rotary engine, it could be configured as a single seat or tandem seat aircraft. Operational history After initial flights in early 1917, the Swedish Army purchased two of the single seat K versions. However, it was more successful as an export plane; the Royal Netherlands Navy bought twelve Ks between 1917 and 1918 and three Thulin KAs. Both types were delivered without armament but the Dutch Navy fitted theirs with machine guns firing through the propeller arc and also experimented with 20 mm Madson cannons. The aircraft's performance was good - Thulin himself broke the Swedish altitude record in it in 1919. However, on 14 May 1919 Thulin's own Thulin K lost an aileron in a steep dive, crashing and killing him. The rest of the Thulin Ks were written off in 1920 and the Thulin KAs were withdrawn in 1922.

Duke of Faial () was a Portuguese title of nobility, named for Faial Island in the Azores, which was granted by royal decree of Queen Maria II of Portugal, dated from 4 April 1833, to Pedro de Sousa Holstein, a 19th century politician who served as Portugal's first prime-minister. Two months later, on 16 June, Sousa Holstein successfully petitioned the Queen to change the title from Duke of Faial to Duke of Palmela, which he used for the rest of his life. On 1 December 1834, less than a year from the abolition of the Faial ducal title for Palmela, Queen Maria II created the title of Marquis of Faial, to be used as a substantive title to the heirs of the Dukes of Palmela. Since 1834, the heir of the Duke of Palmela is always referred to as the Marquis of Faial. Background Chalet Faial on the Portuguese Riviera. When the Queen granted to Dom Pedro de Sousa Holstein the title of Duke of Faial, he was already 1st Count of Palmela (royal decree of 1812) and 1st Marquis of Palmela (royal decree of 1823). Due to his services to the Crown and Country, he obtained the ranking of Duke, as Duke of Faial.

Between the years of 1955 and 1969, Phillips recorded numerous tapes and acetate discs for Liverpool acts, people and businesses in a small room behind the shop his family owned. Phillips first sold bicycles and motorbikes, but later started selling and recharging batteries in a shop in the front room of his house in 1925. After a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s, he started selling electrical goods and popular records. In 1955, Phillips set up a recording studio called Phillips' Sound Recording Services. In 1958, The Quarrymen (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, John 'Duff' Lowe and Colin Hanton) recorded \\"That'll Be The Day\\", and \\"In Spite of All the Danger\\" in the studio. Other clients included Billy Fury, Ken Dodd, and Marty Wilde. Phillips died in 1984. The Quarrymen recording and the site of the studio was commemorated in 2005, when a Blue Plaque was unveiled by two of The Quarrymen (Lowe and Hanton) on the front of the house. Early years Percy Phillips was born in March 1896, in Warrington, Lancashire. He was a veteran of the First World War, and left the British Army (Loyal North Lancashire Regiment) at the rank of Corporal in 1918, since he was wounded before the war ended. After the war, he started selling bicycles and motorbikes in a small shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop in the front room of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips‚Äô Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there. Studio Percy Phillips' shop, studio, and home at 38 Kensington, Liverpool In 1955, several customers asked if Phillips could make demo discs. While on a trip to London to visit his son Frank, who was attending a sound recording course at EMI Electronics, Percy bought a 1/4 inch tape recorder (replaced in 1963 with a Vortexion portable), an MSS (Marguerite Sound Studios - after the owner's wife) disc cutting machine, an amplifier, a 4-track mixer, three microphones (a Reslo, an HMV ribbon microphone, and an AKG), and three pairs of headphones for ¬£400.Babiuk, Lewisohn, and Bacon, Beatles Gear: All the Fab Four's Instruments, from Stage to Studio (2002) p20 Phillips set up the equipment behind his shop in the (12 square feet) middle living room,Spitz (2005) p141 with a piano and an overturned tin bath in the cellar as a reverb chamber, with a speaker and microphone linked to the studio above. The recordings would normally be on tape, and then transferred to disc, although the tape was recorded over again for each session. Because of trams, trucks, and horses passing the premises, Phillips hung heavy blankets over the studio door and a rear window to minimise noise intrusion. Phillips' first recording was of himself singing \\"Bonnie Marie of Argyle\\", (unaccompanied) and a few days later he recorded \\"Unchained Melody\\", with local dance band singer Betty Roy. The first disc he cut in the studio was on 7 August 1955, with his eight- year-old daughter, Carol, singing, \\"Mr Sandman\\". All the discs had \\"Play with a light-weight pick-up\\" on the label, as this would increase the life of the disc, which would eventually wear out. Phillips advertised the studio as Phillips' Sound Recording Services (also advertised as P. F. Phillips' Professional Tape & Disc Recording Service), with his business cards reading: \\"PF Phillips, 38 Kensington, Liverpool, 7. Television and Battery Service. Gramophone Record Dealer. Professional Tape and Disc Recording Studio.\\"Miles, Badman (2001) p14 He cut discs for members of the public, and actors from the Liverpool Playhouse, who often stayed in the first-floor boarding rooms above the studio. Many of the actors would asked by Phillips to record monologues and poems.Spitz (2005) p141 These included the actors John Thaw, Richard Briers, and the ventriloquist Ray Alan. For the first couple of years, Phillips made music compilation discs for local businesses such as the local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, children playing an instrument, or even a neighbour‚Äôs dog howling along to piano accompaniment. As the record shop and studio took over the business, he had a brass plate made which he put on the wall just outside the front door, and had labels made for the discs, but changed the design of the disc label every year. By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle. Ron Wycherly (a.k.a. Billy Fury) recorded several songs onto disc in the studio, including, \\"I'm Left You're Right She's Gone\\", \\"Playin' For Keeps\\", \\"Paralyzed\\" and \\"Come Go With Me\\" (all previously released by Elvis Presley) as well as, \\"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You\\" (Lulu Belle and Scotty) and his own composition, \\"Yodelling Song\\". Fury's mother sent the songs to impresario Larry Parnes, which started her son's singing career. The songs were released on DVD/CD in 2008. The Quarrymen recording Side two of The Quarrymen's record: \\"In Spite of All the Danger\\" (running time 3.25) Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne (from Rory Storm and The Hurricanes) and singer Paul Murphy recorded a version of \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"She‚Äôs Got it\\" in the studio on 22 June 1957. Byrne later played the recording to George Harrison. On 12 July 1958, a local skiffle group, The Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Lowe and Hanton) visited Phillips' studio to record two songs, although the date has been disputed, as Lowe remembered that the recording was during cold weather (October or November, 1957) with the band wearing scarves. Hanton also mentioned the cold weather in interviews,and before recording, Lennon suggested that Hanton put his scarf over the snare drum to lower the volume.Spitz (2005) p143 The group were surprised to see how small and technically basic the studio was, with only one microphone in the centre of the room.Spitz (2005) p142 Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (¬£1) to cover the cost of transferring the tape recording to acetate disc. As this was too expensive, Phillips said that for a cut-rate price they would not be taped first, but record directly to vinyl. The first song they recorded was \\"That‚Äòll Be The Day\\" (sung by Lennon with harmonies by McCartney). Phillips wanted them to immediately record the next song, but Lennon and McCartney could not decide on a song for the B-side of the disc. McCartney suggested the doo-wop ballad, \\"In Spite of All the Danger\\" (by McCartney and Harrison, but sung by Lennon) even though Lowe and Hanton had never heard it before. They asked for some time to rehearse, but Phillips refused, saying, \\"For seventeen and six 17/6d you're not here all day\\".Spitz (2005) p143 Lowe and Hanton busked through the song, which was cut short by Phillips waving his hands to indicate that the cutting needle was getting close to the centre of the acetate. He then handed the band a fragile 78rpm 10-inch acetate record. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and planned to put it up for auction at Sotheby's, but sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. McCartney later had the two songs digitally re-mastered and pressed 50 copies, giving them to friends as a Christmas present, although the two songs were released on 21 November 1995, as part of The Beatles Anthology (Anthology 1). McCartney later said, \\"The strangest thing for me, listening to it, is that it's like drowning, it's like your life flashing by in front of you. From the earliest things by me and John when we used to sag off school and the earliest demo tape we ever made, to the first little record we made which was a version of John singing \\"That'll Be The Day\\", and a little song of mine [and Harrison] on the other side that's never been released before.\\" Later years 38 Kensington today Other customers of Phillips' studio included The Swinging Blue Jeans, Brian Epstein, Freddie Starr, Willy Russell, Liverpool F.C. supporters club, and players from Everton F.C.. Denny Seyton and The Sabres recorded \\"Little Latin Lupe Lu\\" (Bill Medley) in the studio in 1963. Phillips closed the studio in 1969, the record shop in 1974, and died in 1984, at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. The recording of The Quarrymen acetate and the site of Phillips' Sound Recording Services was commemorated on 26 August 2005, when a Blue Plaque was unveiled by two of The Quarrymen (Lowe and Hanton) on the front of the house. Record Collector magazine valued the Beatles related disc (still owned by McCartney) at a value of UK¬£ 200,000 in their 2016 \\"Rare Record Price Guide.\\" (A similar one off acetate recording by a pre famous Elvis Presley by Sam Phillips sold at auction for a similar amount previously).

Its body and forewings are typically reddish brown, tan, or dark green in color and females have a dark spot in the center of each forewing. The bee moth is native to Europe and are named \\"bee moths\\" because they seek out nests of bees and wasps to lay their eggs. Aphomia sociella are considered a pest because the bee moth larvae severely damage commercial bee hives. Bee moths are also studied for their unique mating ritual which includes a release of pheromones from both the male and the female along with an ultrasonic signal emitted through the male‚Äôs tymbals.  Description  View of Aphomia sociella wingspan The adult bee moth has a wingspan of 18-40 millimetres (0.71-1.57 inches). The body and forewings are typically reddish brown, tan, or dark green in color. This species is an example of sexual dimorphism where the male moths are generally more brightly colored and more distinctly patterned compared to the female moths. The females also contain a dark spot on the center of each of their forewings.  Geographic range  The bee moth is commonly found in Europe, Britain, and Asia. In North America, the bee moth has been spotted in various states such as California, Utah, New York, Virginia, and Connecticut. This moth flies from June to August in the temperate parts of its range, e.g. Belgium and The Netherlands.  Parental care = Oviposition  The bee moth is a pest of bumblebees, wasps, and‚Äîon rare occasions‚Äîeven mice. Females prefer to lay their eggs in more exposed and elevated nests of various species of Bombus and Vespine wasps. It is uncommon for a bee moth to seek out nests that are closer to the ground. Because this moth is able to hide its eggs in these foreign nests, it does not have to devote any energy to parental care.  Food resources = Larvae  Bee moth larvae are known to feed on the host eggs, larvae, and pupae left unprotected by the bumble bees and wasps. Bee moth larvae will also feed on pollen, honey, and any waste that they find in the nest.  Life history = Egg  Females are attracted to the odors of active bumble bee nests and will lay up to 100 eggs once it finds a nest that it prefers. The defenses of host colonies tend to increase during the summer; therefore, emergence from the eggs will typically occur in the early summer between March and July in order to take advantage of the temporary weakness of their hosts.  Larvae  Larvae are typically yellow in color and have a length of 22‚Äì30 mm. They begin by spinning a silk around themselves for protection and then proceed to feed on the surrounding environment including the pollen and honey within the nest, stored food, and meconia. The larvae tend to tunnel throughout the nest looking for food all the while destroying large amounts of the nest around them.  Parasitic moths = Host  Aphomia sociella will use the nest of Vespula germanica as a host nest. Female Aphomia sociella have been known to lay eggs in a wide variety of bumble bee, hornet, and wasp nests including the bald-faced hornet (Dolichovespula maculata), the common aerial yellowjacket (D. arenaria), the German wasp (Vespula germanica), and the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris). Coexistence between the bee moth and its host is possible, especially in situations where the host wasps will tend to expand their nests downwards and so leaving the Aphomia sociella larvae to feed on the upper levels. In short, a large nest is able to accommodate both species.  Mechanisms of overcoming host species  The larvae of the Aphomia sociella will spin a strong silk to protect itself while it feeds. This silk is dense and difficult to penetrate and shields the larvae from the potentially harmful bees and wasps.  Protective behavior  If perturbed or threatened, an adult bee moth will fall to the ground and pretend to be dead by lying on their backs in the exact form that they landed. This is beneficial when infiltrating a host wasp or bumblebee nest as the host will be less likely to attack when it believes that the moth is dead.  Mating = Male/male interactions  Male sex pheromones can serve to ward off other competing males by either direct repulsion from the odor or by causing the females to stop their own calling behavior of wing fanning. Males have also been shown to physically attack other competing males for territory in the mating process.  Female/male interactions  Pheromones = Male and female bee moths are both capable of releasing pheromones in order to attract the opposite sex. The females release a pheromone which contains Hexan-1-ol, 6,10,14-trimethylpentadecan-2-ol, and 6,10,14-trimethylpentadecan-2-one. The two compounds hexan-1-ol and TMPD-one serve to boost the strength of the TMPD- ol which is shown to cause males to begin their ultrasonic signaling and proceed in the courtship process. Male bee moths attract females using a sex pheromone which is released from glands in their wings. This pheromone by itself is sufficient to cause female attraction. A major component of this pheromone has been found to be 3,4-Dihydro-9-hydroxy-3-methylisocoumarin (R-mellein). The honeycombs that bee moth larvae feed on is shown to contain a fungus called Aspergillus ochraceus which is known to produce mellein. Experiments also found the same Asp. ochraceus fungus in the intestines of bee moth larvae which suggests that the sex pheromone of mellein is biosynthesized by a microorganism. = Courtship = Males begin the courtship process by silently fanning their wings in one second intervals followed by half a second of rest. At the same time the males will also release their sex pheromones which has a floral odor that triggers a flying or walking response in females. When a female approaches a male bee moth, the male will begin the next step in its courtship process which includes walking, wing fanning, and ‚Äúcourting songs‚Äù which are ultrasonic sounds emitted from the male‚Äôs tegula. The female will then respond to the male by also walking, wing fanning, and emitting its own courtship pheromones. After the female assumes a copulation position, the male can proceed to mate. If the female is repeatedly unreceptive to the male‚Äôs courtship, the male will revert to the first step of its courtship ritual and try again with another female. Other variables, such as female wing-beat sounds and substrate vibrations may also play a part in the courtship process.  Hearing = Sound generation  Aphomia sociella males generate ultrasonic emissions in the courtship rituals during mating. These sounds are generated from wing movements that create high-frequency oscillations of the tegular tymbals. These tymbals are located on the anterior part of the tegulae underneath the patagium sclerite. These ultrasonic emissions are not only emitted when in the presence of females, but also in the presence of other males as well. If a competing male is introduced into the territory of a bee moth that is in the process of courting, the resident is shown to approach and even attack the intruder. Eventually the two males will take up new positions and begin calling for females again. The ultrasonic signals produced by Aphomia sociella males consist of short chirps which are separated by random periods of silence. The average duration of one of these courting/rival songs is approximately 1122 milliseconds and are estimated to have a maximum range of 0.45 meters. Aphomia sociella females lack the tymbals that males possess and so are not able to produce ultrasonic emissions.

It sought to create a platform where a new generation of Zimbabwean writers could give expression to their experiences through writing and create new contexts for the discussion, criticism and dissemination of their work. History Tsotso emerged from an initiative in 1989, when Baobab Books held a workshop for young and beginner at Ranche House College in Harare. The magazine bypassed traditional channels such as academics and foreign institutes, Tsotso‚Ä≤s editorial team - T. O. Mcloughlin, F. R. Mhonyera, M. Mahiri, S. Nondo and H. Lewis - put out a call for submissions in popular mass media publications such as Parade and The Herald in 1990. The result was a flood of submissions, many by first-time writers with little or no experience. \\"This is encouraging,\\" read the editorial response in the second issue of Tsotso, \\"but a note of caution or at least advice is necessary to the young writer.\\" This statement set the tone for what would become the magazine's strong pedagogic praxis. Publishing poetry and prose in English and Shona but also in Ndebele, Tonga and Shangaan, Tsotso sought to rupture the separatist conceptions of black and white writing, oral and print poetry, Western academic and traditional forms that continued to dominate post-independence Zimbabwean literature. A culture of critical reading was advanced through regular reviews and analyses of contemporary and historical Zimbabwean writing, and editorial content was focused on encouraging writers to craft alternative kinds of expression that went beyond surface meaning, dominant myths and traditional clich√©s. The magazine also actively engaged new writers through regular workshops and writing competitions, the results of which often became the focus of the content. Tsotso published irregularly throughout the 1990s. Its mandate was continued in the new millennium by organisations such as the BWAZ (Budding Writers Association of Zimbabwe), which was founded out of a workshop organized by Tsotso and literary anthologies such as amaBooks' Short Writings From Bulawayo and Weaver Press's Writing Still and Writing Now.

The conjectured intractability of such problems is central to the construction of secure lattice-based cryptosystems: Lattice problems are an example of NP-hard problems which have been shown to be average-case hard, providing a test case for the security of cryptographic algorithms. In addition, some lattice problems which are worst-case hard can be used as a basis for extremely secure cryptographic schemes. The use of worst-case hardness in such schemes makes them among the very few schemes that are very likely secure even against quantum computers. For applications in such cryptosystems, lattices over vector space (often \\\\mathbb{Q}^n) or free modules (often \\\\mathbb{Z}^n) are generally considered. For all the problems below, assume that we are given (in addition to other more specific inputs) a basis for the vector space V and a norm N. The norm usually considered is the Euclidean norm L2. However, other norms (such as Lp) are also considered and show up in a variety of results. Let \\\\lambda(L) denote the length of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice L, that is, : \\\\lambda(L) = \\\\min_{v \\\\in L \\\\smallsetminus {\\\\mathbf{0}}} \\\\v\\\\_N. Shortest vector problem (SVP) This is an illustration of the shortest vector problem (basis vectors in blue, shortest vector in red). In the SVP, a basis of a vector space V and a norm N (often L2) are given for a lattice L and one must find the shortest non-zero vector in V, as measured by N, in L. In other words, the algorithm should output a non-zero vector v such that N(v)=\\\\lambda(L). In the Œ≥-approximation version SVPŒ≥, one must find a non-zero lattice vector of length at most \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\lambda(L) for given \\\\gamma \\\\geq 1.  Hardness results  The exact version of the problem is only known to be NP-hard for randomized reductions. By contrast, the corresponding problem with respect to the uniform norm is known to be NP-hard.  Algorithms for the Euclidean norm  To solve the exact version of the SVP under the Euclidean norm, several different approaches are known, which can be split into two classes: algorithms requiring superexponential time (2^{\\\\omega(n)}) and \\\\operatorname{poly}(n) memory, and algorithms requiring both exponential time and space (2^{\\\\Theta(n)}) in the lattice dimension. The former class of algorithms most notably includes lattice enumeration and random sampling reduction, while the latter includes lattice sieving, computing the Voronoi cell of the lattice, and discrete Gaussian sampling. An open problem is whether algorithms for solving exact SVP exist running in single exponential time (2^{O(n)}) and requiring memory scaling polynomially in the lattice dimension. To solve the Œ≥-approximation version SVPŒ≥ for \\\\gamma > 1 for the Euclidean norm, the best known approaches are based on using lattice basis reduction. For large \\\\gamma = 2^{\\\\Omega(n)}, the Lenstra‚ÄìLenstra‚ÄìLov√°sz (LLL) algorithm can find a solution in time polynomial in the lattice dimension. For smaller values \\\\gamma, the Block Korkine-Zolotarev algorithm (BKZ) is commonly used, where the input to the algorithm (the blocksize \\\\beta) determines the time complexity and output quality: for large approximation factors \\\\gamma, a small block size \\\\beta suffices, and the algorithm terminates quickly. For small \\\\gamma, larger \\\\beta are needed to find sufficiently short lattice vectors, and the algorithm takes longer to find a solution. The BKZ algorithm internally uses an exact SVP algorithm as a subroutine (running in lattices of dimension at most \\\\beta), and its overall complexity is closely related to the costs of these SVP calls in dimension \\\\beta. GapSVP The problem GapSVPŒ≤ consists of distinguishing between the instances of SVP in which the length of the shortest vector is at most 1 or larger than \\\\beta, where \\\\beta can be a fixed function of the dimension of the lattice n. Given a basis for the lattice, the algorithm must decide whether \\\\lambda(L) \\\\leq 1 or \\\\lambda(L)>\\\\beta. Like other promise problems, the algorithm is allowed to err on all other cases. Yet another version of the problem is GapSVPŒ∂, Œ≥ for some functions \\\\zeta,\\\\gamma. The input to the algorithm is a basis B and a number d. It is assured that all the vectors in the Gram‚ÄìSchmidt orthogonalization are of length at least 1, and that \\\\lambda(L(B)) \\\\leq \\\\zeta(n) and that 1 \\\\leq d \\\\leq \\\\zeta(n)/\\\\gamma(n) where n is the dimension. The algorithm must accept if \\\\lambda(L(B)) \\\\leq d, and reject if \\\\lambda(L(B)) \\\\geq \\\\gamma(n).d. For large \\\\zeta (\\\\zeta(n)>2^{n/2}), the problem is equivalent to GapSVPŒ≥ because a preprocessing done using the LLL algorithm makes the second condition (and hence, \\\\zeta) redundant. Closest vector problem (CVP) This is an illustration of the closest vector problem (basis vectors in blue, external vector in green, closest vector in red). In CVP, a basis of a vector space V and a metric M (often L2) are given for a lattice L, as well as a vector v in V but not necessarily in L. It is desired to find the vector in L closest to v (as measured by M). In the \\\\gamma-approximation version CVPŒ≥, one must find a lattice vector at distance at most \\\\gamma. Relationship with SVP The closest vector problem is a generalization of the shortest vector problem. It is easy to show that given an oracle for CVPŒ≥ (defined below), one can solve SVPŒ≥ by making some queries to the oracle. The naive method to find the shortest vector by calling the CVPŒ≥ oracle to find the closest vector to 0 does not work because 0 is itself a lattice vector and the algorithm could potentially output 0. The reduction from SVPŒ≥ to CVPŒ≥ is as follows: Suppose that the input to the SVPŒ≥ problem is the basis for lattice B=[b_1,b_2,\\\\ldots,b_n]. Consider the basis B^i=[b_1,\\\\ldots,2b_i,\\\\ldots,b_n] and let x_i be the vector returned by CVPŒ≥(Bi, bi). The claim is that the shortest vector in the set {x_i-b_i} is the shortest vector in the given lattice. Hardness results Goldreich et al. showed that any hardness of SVP implies the same hardness for CVP. Using PCP tools, Arora et al. showed that CVP is hard to approximate within factor 2^{\\\\log^{1-\\\\epsilon}(n)} unless \\\\operatorname{NP} \\\\subseteq \\\\operatorname{DTIME}(2^{\\\\operatorname{poly}(\\\\log n)}). Dinur et al. strengthened this by giving a NP-hardness result with \\\\epsilon=(\\\\log \\\\log n)^c for c<1/2. Sphere decoding Algorithms for CVP, especially the Fincke and Pohst variant, have been used for data detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems (for coded and uncoded signals). In this context it is called sphere decoding due to the radius used internal to many CVP solutions. It has been applied in the field of the integer ambiguity resolution of carrier-phase GNSS (GPS). It is called LAMBDA method in that field. GapCVP This problem is similar to the GapSVP problem. For GapSVPŒ≤, the input consists of a lattice basis and a vector v and the algorithm must answer whether one of the following holds: * there is a lattice vector such that the distance between it and v is at most 1. * every lattice vector is at a distance greater than \\\\beta away from v. The opposite condition is that the closest lattice vector is at a distance 1 < \\\\lambda(L) \\\\leq \\\\beta, hence the name GapCVP. Known results The problem is trivially contained in NP for any approximation factor. Schnorr, in 1987, showed that deterministic polynomial time algorithms can solve the problem for \\\\beta=2^{O(n(\\\\log \\\\log n)^2/\\\\log n)}. Ajtai et al. showed that probabilistic algorithms can achieve a slightly better approximation factor of \\\\beta=2^{O(n \\\\log \\\\log n/\\\\log n)}. In 1993, Banaszczyk showed that GapCVPn is in \\\\mathsf{NP \\\\cap coNP}. In 2000, Goldreich and Goldwasser showed that \\\\beta=\\\\sqrt{n/\\\\log n} puts the problem in both NP and coAM. In 2005, Aharonov and Regev showed that for some constant c, the problem with \\\\beta=c\\\\sqrt{n} is in \\\\mathsf{NP \\\\cap coNP}. For lower bounds, Dinur et al. showed in 1998 that the problem is NP-hard for \\\\beta=n^{o(1/\\\\log{\\\\log{n}})}. Shortest independent vectors problem (SIVP) Given a lattice L of dimension n, the algorithm must output n linearly independent v_1, v_2, \\\\ldots, v_n so that \\\\max \\\\v_i\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\max_B \\\\b_i\\\\ where the right hand side considers all bases B={b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n} of the lattice. In the \\\\gamma-approximate version, given a lattice L with dimension n, find n linearly independent vectors v_1, v_2,\\\\ldots, v_n of length \\\\max \\\\v_i\\\\ \\\\le \\\\gamma \\\\lambda_n(L), where \\\\lambda_n(L) is the n'th successive minimum of L. Bounded distance decoding This problem is similar to CVP. Given a vector such that its distance from the lattice is at most \\\\lambda(L)/2, the algorithm must output the closest lattice vector to it. Covering radius problem Given a basis for the lattice, the algorithm must find the largest distance (or in some versions, its approximation) from any vector to the lattice. Shortest basis problem Many problems become easier if the input basis consists of short vectors. An algorithm that solves the Shortest Basis Problem (SBP) must, given a lattice basis B, output an equivalent basis B' such that the length of the longest vector in B' is as short as possible. The approximation version SBPŒ≥ problem consist of finding a basis whose longest vector is at most \\\\gamma times longer than the longest vector in the shortest basis. Use in cryptography Average case hardness of problems forms a basis for proofs-of-security for most cryptographic schemes. However, experimental evidence suggests that most NP-hard problems lack this property: they are probably only worst case hard. Many lattice problems have been conjectured or proven to be average-case hard, making them an attractive class of problems to base cryptographic schemes on. Moreover, worst-case hardness of some lattice problems have been used to create secure cryptographic schemes. The use of worst-case hardness in such schemes makes them among the very few schemes that are very likely secure even against quantum computers. The above lattice problems are easy to solve if the algorithm is provided with a \\"good\\" basis. Lattice reduction algorithms aim, given a basis for a lattice, to output a new basis consisting of relatively short, nearly orthogonal vectors. The Lenstra‚ÄìLenstra‚ÄìLov√°sz lattice basis reduction algorithm (LLL) was an early efficient algorithm for this problem which could output an almost reduced lattice basis in polynomial time. This algorithm and its further refinements were used to break several cryptographic schemes, establishing its status as a very important tool in cryptanalysis. The success of LLL on experimental data led to a belief that lattice reduction might be an easy problem in practice. However, this belief was challenged when in the late 1990s, several new results on the hardness of lattice problems were obtained, starting with the result of Ajtai. In his seminal papers, Ajtai showed that the SVP problem was NP-hard and discovered some connections between the worst-case complexity and average-case complexity of some lattice problems. Building on these results, Ajtai and Dwork created a public-key cryptosystem whose security could be proven using only the worst case hardness of a certain version of SVP, thus making it the first result to have used worst-case hardness to create secure systems.

The union is one of the largest local white-collar unions in the United States and is New York's second-largest state-employee union.Northrup, \\"Layoff Plans in Motion, PEF Wonders What Happened to Retirement Incentive,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 22, 2010. PEF also represents employees who work in private- sector jobs and local government agencies. The union publishes The Communicator, online newsletter with a 2007 distribution of 70,000, on a monthly basis.Zipser, \\"Postal Rate Hike Hits Labor Press,\\" The Guild Reporter, September 14, 2007. Composition According to PEF's Department of Labor records, the union is composed of three categories of members: \\"administrative,\\" \\"institutional,\\" and \\"private/public sector.\\" Of the total membership, these comprise around 69%, 28% and 3%, or 35,088, 14,065, and 1,443 members, respectively. The first two of these classifications cover two types of labor in \\"the Professional, Technical, and Scientific Titles [...] as designated by NYS and Civil Service.\\" The third, smallest, portion covers several other employers. PEF contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers, which number comparatively about one twentieth of the size of the union's membership, or 2,790 non-members. Origins In 1971, 61-year- old George Hardy was elected president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).Who Was Who in America, 1991.Cook, \\"George Hardy, 79, Pioneer Leader of Service Worker Union, Is Dead,\\" New York Times, September 18, 1990. Under Hardy, SEIU's health care and public employee divisions saw rapid growth. Much of the membership growth, however, came through affiliation rather than new member organizing. Hardy viewed the fast-growing American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) as SEIU's chief competitor.McCartin, \\" 'A Wagner Act for Public Employees': Labor's Deferred Dream and the Rise of Conservatism, 1970‚Äì1976,\\" Journal of American History, June 2008. AFSCME had grown from a mere 100,000 members in 1951 to 500,000 members in 1972, and had elected a dynamic and aggressive new leader, 45-year- old Jerry Wurf, in 1964.Billings and Greenya, Power to the Public Worker, 1974. Not only was AFSCME's growth substantial, its demographics matched those of SEIU's: At least two-thirds of the rival union's members were blue-collar workers, and a fifth of them worked in hospitals and nursing homes. To counter AFSCME's rapid growth, Hardy adopted a strategy of affiliating existing unions rather than organizing unorganized workers. Between 1971 and 1980, SEIU affiliated 22 independent unions.Moody, An Injury to All: The Decline of American Unionism, 1988. Merger and affiliation accounted for 230,000 new members from 1971 to 1985, and virtually all of the union's growth from 1980 to 1984. One of SEIU's major growth spurts came in 1978, when it raided the Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA). In existence since 1910, CSEA had won representation rights for New York State's 140,000 public employees after the state passed a public employee collective bargaining law in 1968. Structured like an association rather than a union, CSEA hesitated to engage in militant labor action or strike, and yet it had a rocky relationship with the state: The union struck for two days at the beginning of April 1972Clarity, \\"State Employes Begin a Walkout,\\" New York Times, April 1, 1972. and won a 5.5 percent pay hike.Clarity, \\"State Strike Ends As Workers Win Raise and Bonus,\\" New York Times, April 3, 1972. But the strike and dissatisfaction with CSEA's leadership led some CSEA members to ask for representation by SEIU. With Hardy's strong backing, the newly formed union was able to gather enough signatures on petitions to trigger a representational vote in two of the four units where workers were represented by CSEA, but SEIU lost the vote by a 3-to-1 margin in December 1972.Stetson, \\"State Employes Will Vote This Week,\\" New York Times, December 3, 1972; Johnson, \\"State Institutional Employes to Stay in Civil Service Union,\\" New York Times, December 9, 1972; \\"State's Professional Aides Vote to Retain Association,\\" New York Times, December 10, 1972. A second strike planned by CSEA leaders was called off after delegates overwhelmingly repudiated a strike resolution supported by the union's leaders.Carroll, \\"State Workers Postpone Strike After Rift Develops,\\" New York Times, April 1, 1975. The internal strife led SEIU to once again challenge CSEA for a large unit of New York State public employees. In an election held December 5, 1975, an SEIU-led coalition which included the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the Laborers' International Union of North America, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and several building trades unions was defeated by CSEA, 10,858 to 10,348 with 1,015 voting for neither union.\\"C.S.E.A. Wins a Test in Albany Election,\\" New York Times, February 8, 1976. With neither side winning a majority, a second election was held the first week of February 1976, which CSEA won (14,321 to 10,184). But Hardy continued to raid CSEA. CSEA leaders initially sought protection by affiliating with AFSCME. Article 20 of the AFL- CIO constitution prohibits affiliates from raiding one another's members, and an affiliation with AFSCME would have won CSEA relief from the raids.\\"Civil Service Association Bars Merger With Union,\\" New York Times, March 18, 1976. But CSEA delegates formally barred their leaders from seeking an affiliation with AFSCME in March 1976. CSEA's contract with the state of New York expired in 1977. Although CSEA leaders once more proposed a strike, the union settled for a 14 percent pay raise in April 1977.Stetson, \\"New York State Employees Plan For a Possible Strike on April 18,\\" New York Times, April 7, 1977; Meislin, \\"Albany Pact to Give State Workers Raise of 14% Over 2 Years,\\" New York Times, April 18, 1977. Hardy, convinced SEIU could successfully raid CSEA, conducted secret polls which showed that deep unrest in the professional, scientific, and technical (PS&T;) unit.\\"Tom Hobart Interview,\\" CSEA History Project, SUNY-Albany, December 7, 2004. Working only with the AFT, SEIU once more obtained enough petitions to challenge CSEA representation in the PS&T; unit. The raid was successful, and the coalition (known as the Public Employees Federation) won, 15,062 to 12,259.Stetson, \\"State's Employees Get Different Union,\\" New York Times, April 16, 1978. Hardy and AFT leader Albert Shanker hoped to raid CSEA further, but CSEA affiliated with AFSMCE on April 21, 1978.Gupte, \\"Union of Civil Service Employees to Affiliate With a Longtime Rival,\\" New York Times, April 22, 1978. The affiliation made AFSCME the largest affiliate in the AFL-CIO.Flint, \\"New York Labor Dispute Hints at a Jurisdictional War,\\" New York Times, May 2, 1978. CSEA challenged the SEIU/AFT coalition's victory, however. CSEA attorneys alleged that nearly 5,000 of the signatures on the petition forcing an election were fraudulent.\\"Hearings Consider Union Dispute,\\" New York Times, May 21, 1978. A New York Supreme Court (the state's trial court of general jurisdiction) initially dismissed the suit,\\"Civil Service Union Loses Vote Appeal,\\" New York Times, July 21, 1978. but it was reinstated by a state appellate court.\\"Civil Service Union Wins Appeal,\\" New York Times, January 12, 1979. As the lawsuit progressed, CSEA won a new three-year contract which included a 7 percent pay hike in the first year.Meislin, \\"New York State Agrees to 7% Rise And New Merit Setup for 105,000,\\" New York Times, March 12, 1979; \\"Governor Announces Three-Year Wage Pact With State's Workers,\\" New York Times, March 13, 1979. But the new union, now called the Public Employees Federation, ultimately prevailed in the New York Court of Appeals (the highest court in the state of New York) on March 28, 1979.\\"Union Awarded Right to Represent Professional Employees,\\" New York Times, March 28, 1979. PEF subsequently negotiated a controversial contract which gave union members a 36 percent pay increase over three years.Stetson, \\"State Employees to Vote on New Contract Nov. 19,\\" New York Times, November 10, 1979. Submitted to the members without the approval of PEF's executive council, the contract was overwhelmingly approved by PEF members on December 6, 1979.\\"State Employees Approve Pact,\\" New York Times, December 7, 1979. History=Kraemer presidency PEF's first president, John J. Kraemer, served a single, turbulent term in office. He was accused of being a \\"no-show\\" employee at his previous position with the New York State Department of Labor,\\"State Accused of Paying Unionist in No-Show Job,\\" New York Times, July 31, 1979. but was exonerated of the charges.Picchi, \\"Unionist's Career a Stormy One,\\" Albany Times-Union. March 6, 1987. He also had been accused and found innocent of being paid a salary from both PEF and state. As his legal troubles continued, Kraemer focused on negotiating the union's second contract. Pensions were a major issue for the union.Levine, \\"State Retirees Need Pension Relief Now,\\" New York Times, April 15, 1981. In 1976, the state enacted a new pension plan under which state employees paid income taxes on their mandatory contribution to the state pension plan, which PEF claimed forced workers to pay taxes on income they may never receive.Wexler, \\"PEF Lobbies for Improved Pensions,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 8, 1988. Although the agreement ratified in March 1982 did not address the pension issue, the contract negotiated by Kraemer won pay raises of 9 percent the first year and 8 percent the next two years in exchange for a reduction in the number of sick days given to employees.Chira, \\"State Reaches Tentative Pact With Civil Service Employees,\\" New York Times, February 28, 1982. Kraemer lost re- election in 1982 to Elizabeth Hoke. The 1,100-member Statewide Coalition for a Democratic Union (SCDU), at the time PEF's only organized \\"political party,\\" had formed to challenge Kraemer and support Hoke.Kelly, \\"PEF Chief Defeats Challenger in Primary,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 24, 1988. The election was a bitter one, with Hoke accusing Kraemer of poor leadership. Hoke presidency When Hoke assumed the presidency, she found the union was more than $400,000 in debt. An investigation found that Kraemer had embezzled funds from the union.Halbrook, \\"PEF Mourns Death of Founder, John Kraemer,\\" PEF Communicator, December 2005-January 2006.Kraemer would be convicted in 2000 for embezzling from another union, Local 29 of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, in Hackensack, New Jersey. At the time of his death, he would be under investigation for conspiring to embezzle more than $296,000 from the Professional Employee‚Äôs Guild (PEG) of Hackensack and the union‚Äôs welfare fund. See: \\"New York Lawyer Indicted for Alleged Union Embezzlement,\\" press release, U.S. Department of Justice, November 1, 2006. Kraemer pleaded guilty to the charges in early 1987.\\"Ex-PEF Chief Admits Theft,\\" Albany Times- Union, March 5, 1987. Hoke's presidency was in some ways dissimilar to Kraemer's. Unlike Kraemer, Hoke took a low-key approach to the PEF presidency, rarely seeking the media spotlight or public attention.Picchi, \\"PEF Gears Up for 'Toughest' Contract Negotiations,\\" Albany Times-Union, November 7, 1987. But her presidency suffered several scandals as well. In 1984, Hoke revoked the union leave of PEF's three statewide vice presidents, a move which was very controversial among PEF members.\\"Unions Open Query Into PEF Dispute,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 24, 1984. Later that year, she was accused of using her PEF credit card for personal expenses.\\"Hoke 'Censors' Union Article on Credit Card Use,\\" Albany Times-Union, September 11, 1984. Hoke also sued to sever PEF's dual affiliation with the AFT and SEIU, claiming the two unions held too much power over PEF and provided little services in return.AFT and SEIU held veto power over any changes to PEF's bylaws and constitution, the ability to establish a trusteeship over PEF, and the authority to dissolve PEF without PEF members' consent. Initially, the affiliation agreement also gave AFT and SEIU, rather than PEF members, the right to elect the PEF executive board. See: \\"New York State Public Employees seek to Loosen Dual Affiliation,\\" Labor Notes, January 26, 1984. The suit was unsuccessful. Contract negotiations in 1985 were particularly contentious. PEF was especially critical of a state proposal to restructure the state employee health insurance program.Schmalz, \\"State and Its Top Union Reach A Pact,\\" New York Times, April 1, 1985. Mediators had to be called in to help settle the contract.\\"Mediators Named In State Deadlock,\\" Associated Press, April 9, 1985. PEF settled for 5 percent pay raises in each of the contract's three years and an accidental-death benefit.Newkirk, \\"PEF Chief to Press for Large Pay Hikes,\\" Albany Times-Union, November 23, 1987. Hoke failed to win re-election in 1985 due to member dissatisfaction with 1985 contract.Gottlieb, \\"PEF Shudders During Contract Fight,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 12, 1993. SCDU withdrew its support for Hoke and actively supported challenger Rand Condell. Condell presidency Rand Condell struggled to bring some organizational stability to PEF. In 1986, he settled a lawsuit against PEF by the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) and the AFT. NYSUT and the AFT had claimed that PEF had underpaid dues for half its membership since its inception, leading to a $10 million to $12 million underpayment. In the settlement, PEF withdrew as an affiliate of NYSUT (AFT's state federation in New York) and the AFT agreed to reimburse NYSUT for the services NYSUT had rendered to PEF. In return, PEF agreed to pay increase per capita dues payments for half its members by 71 percent (to $72 from $42) and remit the higher dues payments to the AFT. The NYSUT disaffiliation saved PEF $3.5 million a year, but increased PEF's dues to the AFT by $600,000 a year.Chalmers, \\"Unions Near Agreement in Dues Dispute,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 25, 1986. To cover the cost of the higher payments to the AFT, Condell sought a large dues increase from PEF members. Condell proposed raising dues on a sliding scale, with its lowest-paid members incurring a 14 percent dues increase while its highest-paid members saw a 55 percent dues increase. The dues hikes would be the first since the last year of Kraemer's presidency.Cross, \\"Public Employees' Union Seeks Dues Raise,\\" Albany Times-Union, September 27, 1986. Although Condell expected easy passage of the dues hike,Bang-Jensen, \\"PEF Leaders Anticipating Dues Hike Approval,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 17, 1986. the proposal did not win the 60 percent majority needed at the PEF convention in October 1986.\\"Dues Hike Defeated in PEF Vote,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 21, 1986. Condell immediately resubmitted the dues proposal to members two days later, and it easily passed (leading to an average increase of $4.08 per member per month, giving the union about $2.8 million more each year).\\"Union Approves Dues Increase,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 21, 1986. The extra dues allowed PEF to build a new headquarters in Latham, New York.Newkirk, \\"PEF to Break Ground for New $1.7 Million Building in Latham,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 11, 1987. During his first term in office, Condell fought the state on a number of issues. The need for higher pensions continued to rank high on the union's agenda.Chalmers, \\"Retirees Push 'Pension Justice' Campaign,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 26, 1986; Ginsberg, \\"Pension Raise Needed,\\" New York Times, January 2, 1987. The union also fought large layoffs of state workers, particularly at the New York State Department of Labor.Hughes, \\"PEF Hits States Layoff Plans,\\" Albany Times- Union, February 3, 1987; \\"State Labor Cuts Under Fire,\\" Albany Times-Union, January 23, 1987. But much of the union's attention was focused on a major battle in 1987 over pay equity. The governor had proposed and the state legislature had approved a plan to give more than 42,600 state workers (about 5,000 of whom were PEF members) retroactive pay increases to make up for disparities with private-sector pay, lower wages given to women, and work in hazardous occupations. PEF filed a grievance against the pay plan, arguing that it downgraded some of the occupational titles of its members.Newkirk, \\"Union Grieves Pay Equity Plan,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 19, 1987; Newkirk, \\"CSEA, PEF Clash Over Pay Equity,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 2, 1987; Newkirk, \\"Grievance Stalls PEF Pay Equity Increases,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 5, 1987. PEF reacted angrily when the pay equity increase subsequently went through for all state workers except those belonging to PEF.Picchi, \\"Pay Raise Exclusion Irks Union,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 7, 1987. Condell then negotiated an agreement preventing any job title downgrades, and the pay increase for PEF members went through in September 1987.Hughes, \\"State, Union Reach Accord,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 28, 1987. As Condell's first term ended, he promised to push for \\"substantial\\" pay raises in the union's upcoming contract negotiations even as his opponents attacked him for concentrating authority in staff hands and for poor leadership. Nonetheless, he was challenged for the SCDU endorsement by Michael Keenan, president of PEF's largest division.\\"PEF Chief Faces Primary Challenge,\\" Albany Times- Union, January 26, 1988. Condell defeated Keenan, 388 to 275.Picchi, \\"PEF Head On Way to 2nd Term,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 24, 1988. Nonetheless, a new political party, the Committee for Independent Officers, arose and successfully contended for four of the six seats for state vice president, regional coordinator, and trustee (including among its winning candidates future PEF presidents Howard Shafer and Roger Benson). To firm up his political position, Condell called for a two- rather than three-year contract, with a 7 percent pay rise in each year.Llavore, \\"PEF Pushing for 7% Hike in New Pact,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 28, 1988; Barron, \\"New York Unions Nearing Deadline,\\" New York Times, March 27, 1988. Even when CSEA settled for a three-year agreement with salary increases of 5 percent, 5.5 percent, and 5.5 percent in each of its three years, Condell continued to push for 7 percent.Kelly, \\"PEF Will Continue Demands Despite 16.3% CSEA Pact,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 8, 1988. But health insurance, not pay, ended up being the biggest stumbling block.\\"CSEA Ratifies Four State Pacts,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 3, 1988; Wexler, \\"PEF Blasts State on Health Insurance Pact Proposal,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 17, 1988. The state declared an impasse in mid June (10 weeks after PEF's contract had expired), and mediators were called in.Wexler, \\"State Declares Impasse in PEF Talks,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 16, 1988; Wexler, \\"PEF, State to Begin Mediation Monday,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 21, 1988. Without the mediators' help, however, Condell reached a three-year agreement on July 11 with the same pay structure achieved by CSEA and no improvements in health benefits.Wexler, \\"Details Kept Under Wraps,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 12, 1988; Wexler, \\"PEF Votes By 3 to 1 For State Pact,\\" Albany Times-Union, September 10, 1988. On July 20, 1988, PEF won its first private-sector representation election (for workers at the New York City branch of Narcotic and Drug Research Inc.‚Äîa contractor for the state).\\"PEF Wins Bid to Represent Private Employees of State Contractor,\\" Albany Times- Union, July 27, 1988. Condell barely survived a serious political challenge to his presidency in 1989. PEF spent much of the year fighting layoffs.Gesensway, \\"Unionist's State Job in Doubt,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 10, 1989. Convinced that PEF would be fighting layoffs the following year as well, Condell proposed raising dues 26.6 percent ($5.28 a month) to build a public relations and legal war chest. But PEF leaders balked at submitting the dues increase to the membership.Gesensway, \\"PEF Leaders Balk at Dues Hike,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 15, 1989; \\"PEF Proposes Hiking Dues on Sliding Scale,\\" United Press International, September 9, 1989. PEF's 127-member executive board refused to recommend Condell's dues hike to the membership, but agreed to submit the plan to a vote anyway.Gesensway, \\"PEF Dues Increase Vote Likely Key to Future of Union President,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 17, 1989. The leadership of PEF's Capitol District (its largest region) floated their own plan for a dues increase at a much lower level, and observers concluded that if Condell lost the dues vote at the upcoming PEF convention in October he would probably not be able to win re-election in 1991. PEF members did indeed reject Condell's proposal for a dues increase (twice), but also refused to approval six other plans for a dues increase offered by leaders of the Capitol District as well as others.Gesensway, \\"PEF Still Debating Dues at Convention,\\" Albany Times- Union, October 18, 1989. After extensive parliamentary maneuvering (which some PEF members claimed was illegal), Condell was able to win approval of his original dues proposal.Gesensway, \\"PEF Delegates OK Dues Hike in Last-Minute Turnaround,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 19, 1989; Gesensway, \\"PEF Dissidents Examine Dues Hike,\\" Albany Times-Union, November 20, 1989. Condell's support within the union evaporated throughout 1990, and Condell fought the state over early retirement, hiring freezes, large layoffs, furloughs, and a state plan which withheld a week's pay from workers until they retired.Lopez, \\"Unionized State Workers Protest Proposed Cuts,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 22, 1990; Precious, \\"Unions Oppose Cuomo Deal on Early Retirement,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 11, 1990; Precious, \\"State's Workers Stall on Early Retirement,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 22, 1990; Precious, \\"Cuomo Imposes Freeze on Hiring,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 31, 1990; Borsellino, \\"Cuomo Will Lay Off Workers to Close Budget Gap,\\" Albany Times-Union, November 10, 1990; Precious, \\"10,000 State Workers Face Budget Ax,\\" Albany Times-Union, November 14, 1990; Precious, \\"State Furlough Proposal Appears Dead,\\" Albany Times-Union, December 14, 1990; \\"Union Sues over Lag Payroll,\\" Associated Press, January 11, 1991; Janison, \\"Unions Take On Old Friend Cuomo,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 6, 1991. In this difficult employment environment, the PEF contract expired. Negotiations with the state stalemated in March 1991, the state declared an impasse, and an arbitrator was named in April.Precious, \\"Unions Say Cuomo Broke Deal By Discussing Talks,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 9, 1991; Precious, \\"Administration Hints at Impasse With PEF,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 7, 1991; Precious, \\"State Breaks Off Talks With Second Union,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 13, 1991; \\"Arbitrator Named for PEF Impasse,\\" Albany Times- Union, April 12, 1991. Condell was challenged for the PEF presidency by Howard Shafer. Shafer, supported by the Team for a Stronger Membership caucus, ran a full slate of candidates and accused Condell of poor leadership and embracing Governor Mario Cuomo too strongly.Precious, \\"Cuomo Backing Will Be Focus of PEF President Campaign,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 15, 1991; Borsellino, \\"2 Candidates Vying for PEF Presidency,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 5, 1991; Precious, \\"June Union Election,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 19, 1991; Bauder, \\"Union Insurgents Make Cuomo the Issue,\\" Associated Press, June 5, 1991; Beidel, \\"PEF Election a War of Words,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 13, 1991; Verhovek, \\"Political Talk,\\" New York Times, June 9, 1991. The election was a bitter one, and Shafer contended Condell was using the union's monthly newsmagazine to promote his candidacacyBorsellino, \\"PEF Boss Getting Good Press,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 12, 1991. On June 26, 1991, after record turnout, Shafer defeated Condell 3 to 1 (12,948 to 7,963, a margin of victory that surprised both candidates), and Shafer's entire ticket was swept into office.Beidel, \\"PEF Membership Ousts Condell From Presidency,\\" Albany Times- Union, June 26, 1991; Sack, \\"Union Chief's Defeat Tied to Anger at Cuomo,\\" New York Times, June 27, 1991; Beidel, \\"PEF Vote Reflects Union's Rebellion Against Leadership,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 27, 1991. Scandal struck the union again in Condell's final days in office. Condell signed an agreement which would give his senior aides lucrative severance payments worth thousands of dollars each if they were fired by Shafer.Precious, \\"Condell Offeers Aides Golden Parachutes,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 31, 1991. After a half hour of debate, the PEF executive board overturned the severance agreements on Shafer's first day in office.Precious, \\"Shafer Assumes Presidency of PEF,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 2, 1991. Shafer presidency At first, the expired contract Shafer inherited did not seem an intractable problem. In December 1991, PEF members ratified a contractual change to their health plan which was seen as a referendum on Shafer's leadership.Janison, \\"PEF Ratifies Health Insurance Change,\\" Albany Times-Union, December 18, 1991. But negotiations for the expiring PEF contract soon broke down, a legislative fact-finding panel was imposed on the talks, and the state proposed eliminating nearly 14,000 public sector jobs.Janison, \\"Fact-Finding Panel Named in Contract Talks With PEF,\\" Albany Times-Union, January 8, 1992; Precious, \\"Cuomo Poised to Eliminate 14,000 Jobs,\\" Albany Times-Union, January 10, 1992; Janison, \\"State Workers Face Long Wait for Contracts,\\" Albany Times- Union, June 21, 1992. Finally, the governor set a June 25 deadline for resolving any contract talks. PEF held out. But when other unions settled their contracts, PEF wanted the same deal and didn't get it.Janison, \\"State's Labor Talks Make Scant Progress Despite Deadline,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 25, 1992; Janison, \\"Union Wants What Others Got,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 1, 1992.

The lack of a contract created a crisis for many PEF members. Nearly 153,000 PEF workers and their family members lost their prescription drug, dental care, and vision care benefits in September 1992.Brandon, \\"PEF Members Losing Some Benefits,\\" Albany Times-Union, September 25, 1992; Janison, \\"PEF Members Begin to Feel Effects of the Benefits Crisis,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 5, 1992.

As the state laid off public workers, PEF's membership dropped from 59,000 to 55,000 members, depriving the union of $1 million in dues revenue. Vacant positions on PEF's staff were eliminated or went unfilled (angering members, who felt the brunt of the grievance and service cuts), and officers took salary cuts.Janison, \\"Union Budget Target of Fight,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 1, 1992. PEF members accused Shafer of playing politics with the staff cuts by jettisoning staff positions filled by his political opponents, and the PEF executive board retaliated by dismissing Roger Benson (one of Shafer's closest aides).Janison, \\"PEF Members, Angered By President, To Picket Office,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 27, 1992. The internal dissent became so bad that alleged assaults, racially inflammatory fliers, and accusations of financial fraud occurred at the SEIU Convention which PEF delegates attended in May 1992.Janison, \\"PEF Factions War Over Allegations at SEIU Convention,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 25, 1992. Some PEF members began circulating decertification petitions, and Shafer's political opponents formed a new caucus (Members United for a Responsible Union) to run a slate of candidates against him in 1994.Janison, \\"PEF Members Show Signs of Frustration,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 19, 1992. The bargaining atmosphere deteriorated throughout the remainder of 1992. The state's chief negotiator said he would wait for the legislative fact-finding panel's recommendation, Shafer implied he might oppose a proposed bond measure which would help fund state jobs, and Shafer accused the governor of releasing private confidential negotiating information to PEF members without the union's consent.Janison, \\"Chances Increase That PEF Contract Will Have to Wait Until Next Year,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 20, 1992. At PEF's convention in October 1992, Members United for a Responsible Union leafletted against Shafer, accused him of neglecting members' needs and trying to curry favor with the AFT. Although the legislature passed a mandatory binding arbitration bill, the governor vetoed the legislation.\\"Cuomo Vetoes PEF Arbitration,\\" Albany Times-Union, November 26, 1992. Now looking at two years without a new contract, Shafer hired Theodore W. Kheel, a well-known labor negotiator, to help the union win a new pact.\\"State Union Hires Labor Negotiator,\\" Albany Times-Union, December 31, 1992. PEF reached a new contract with the state in March 1993. Although the state's chief negotiation withdrew the state's last contract offer at the end of February,Janison, \\"State Withdraws Its Offer to PEF,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 27, 1993. the governor personally put it back on the table.Janison, \\"Cuomo Puts Offer to PEF Back on Table,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 18, 1993. Shafer quickly agreed to the pact, which included a 9.5 percent salary increase over four years that was retroactive to April 1, 1991; moved PEF members into the state's health insurance pool; and ended PEF's lawsuit over the state's decision to defer a week's pay until each member retired.Janison, \\"After 2 Years Without A Contract, PEF, State Reach Tentative Accord,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 20, 1993; Myers, \\"Albany and State Professionals' Union Reach Agreement on Contract,\\" New York Times, March 20, 1993. Although the PEF executive board voted to recommend the contract to PEF's members, those who voted \\"no\\" on the pact argued that PEF had achieved less than other unions, that the deal traded concessions for pay increases, and that the money spent on Kheel's consulting contract had gotten the union nothing better than what had been offered months before.Janison, \\"Rank and File to Vote in May on PEF's New Contract,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 27, 1993. The board meeting was a raucous one, with alleged physical confrontations, a \\"Dump Shafer\\" movement hanging banners near the entrance, rumors of decertification, and proposals for PEF to abandon its independence and join either SEIU or AFT.Janison, \\"PEF Grapples With More Than Just Contract,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 29, 1993. Members of PEF voted 28,774 to 7,281 to ratify the new four-year contract on May 12, 1993.\\"PEF Members Vote to Ratify New Four-Year Contract,\\" Associated Press, May 12, 1993. Shafer was defeated for re-election as PEF president by James Sheedy in June 1994. Although Shafer and Sheedy had originally been on the same political slate three years earlier, the relationship between the two men had deteriorated into a chilly civility in which they communicated with one another largely via memo (despite having offices next door to one another). The margin of victory was 388 votes, the slimmest margin in the union's 15-year history. Sheedy's entire slate also narrowly edged out the Shafer slate's candidates.Gottlieb, \\"Opponent Defeats PEF Chief,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 29, 1994; Gottlieb, \\"Defeated PEF Chief Delays Certification Vote,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 3, 1994. Sheedy presidency Sheedy spent much of his first two years in office as his predecessors did‚Äîfighting large layoffs of state workers. Governor George Pataki vetoed legislation improving pensions, threatened to shut down state government and furlough all non-essential workers if the legislature didn't approve his budget, attempted to close state-run health care facilities, and cut more than 5,500 state jobs.Sack, \\"Pataki Vetoes Pension Rise, Citing Budget,\\" New York Times, February 9, 1995; Precious, \\"Pataki Considers Massive, Temporary Layoffs,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 9, 1995; Precious, \\"Pataki Won't Shut Down State,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 29, 1995; Lipman, \\"Union Sues to Save Psychiatric Center,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 9, 1996; Metzgar, \\"Pataki OKs Plans to Cut 5,542 Jobs,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 11, 1996. In this difficult negotiating climate, Sheedy re-negotiated PEF's expiring contract in April 1995. He agreed to the same financial package won by CSEA a month earlier: A four-year contract with a 3.5 percent salary increase in 1997 and 1998, and one-time bonuses in 1996 and 1997; a change in civil service definitions which would permit PEF workers to transfer more easily to other jobs and retain their salary levels; and no expiration date for the union's benefit packages.Gottlieb, \\"PEF Near Accord With State On New Contract,\\" Albany Times- Union, May 5, 1995; Hurewitz, \\"PEF, State Reach Tentative Contract Agreement,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 9, 1995; Gottlieb, \\"PEF Members OK 4-Year Labor Pact,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 12, 1995. Additional job cuts occurred in 1996 and 1997, totalling 20,000 state workers.Lipman, \\"Feeling the Pain of State Job Cuts,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 23, 1997. The state offered early retirement again to many employees.Metzgar, \\"State to Offer Incentive to Retire,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 11, 1997. When the state pension fund showed a surplus, Sheedy found himself caught between two opposing factions of PEF members: Use the funds to lower pension contribution costs from current members, or give the surplus to retiree members as a cost-of-living increase.Metzgar, \\"State Workers, Retirees Compete for Pension Cash,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 13, 1997. Sheedy was more successful on other issues. He signed the union's first agreement with the state to provide domestic partner benefits in September 1994.Gottlieb, \\"PEF Agrees to Domestic Partner Benefit,\\" Albany Times-Union, September 28, 1994. He fiercely fought a move to consolidate state information technology workers at sites the union felt were hazardous.Gottlieb, \\"PEF Tries to Block Move to Kingston,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 18, 1995; Gottlieb and Precious, \\"Pataki, Bruno Still At Odds Over Job Move,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 26, 1995; Lipman, \\"Union, State Squabble Over IBM Deal,\\" Albany Times-Union, September 29, 1995; Gottlieb, \\"PEF Leader Assails Job Moves,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 28, 1995. PEF also won a federal lawsuit requiring the state to pay millions of dollars in overtime to PEF members,Metzgar, \\"OT Ruling May Cost Millions,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 17, 1996. and reinstated the lawsuit in state court after the state appealed.Metzgar, \\"PEF Urging Members to Sue State,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 2, 1996; Metzgar, \\"PEF Sues the State to Get Overtime Pay for Workers,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 9, 1997. Sheedy also undertook the union's first large-scale organizing campaigns since its formation. AFT, one of PEF's parent unions, assigned a full-time national organizer to help PEF organize health care workers in the private sector who worked for potential state contractors.Metzgar, \\"PEF Tries to Increase Its Members,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 29, 1996. But this plan backfired politically. In 1996, PEF won an election for 42 paraprofessional health care workers working for a private contractor at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility.Metzgar, \\"42 Medical Workers Vote to Join PEF,\\" Albany Times-Union, November 13, 1996. This organizing drive was highly criticized by Sheedy's political opponents, who claimed the union's executive board did not approve the organizing effort and who argued that PEF should only be organizing professional (not paraprofessional) workers.Fox, \\"PEF Move to Organizing Non-Professionals A Mistake,\\" Albany Times-Union, November 22, 1996. Sheedy also fought openly with the PEF staff union. Ninety-six of PEF's 120 staff belonged to Local 9265 of the United Steelworkers of America and had been working without a contract for nine months by March 1996.Metzgar, \\"Disgruntled PEF Workers Pit A Union Against A Union,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 30, 1996. The staff union complained that PEF refused to negotiate over layoffs and downsizing, demanded a 10 percent pay raise (with differential pay for downstate workers), and several position upgrades. Roger Benson, former chief of staff under PEF President Howard Shafer, supported the staff union publicly and strongly criticized Sheedy for his poor labor relations.Metzgar, \\"PEF Contract Dispute Embroiled in Politics,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 2, 1996. PEF and its staff union finally settled their contract dispute in June 1996. The staff union won 3.5 percent pay increases in 1998 and 1999 and lump-sum bonuses paid in 1996 and 1997, enhancements to the dental plan, and concessions on the prescription drug plan and seniority rights.Metzgar, \\"PEF Reaches Agreement With Its Own Union Workers,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 29, 1996. Sheedy's re-election campaign was a difficult, and ultimately unsuccessful, one. Beginning in the spring of 1996, Roger Benson began putting together a statewide organization (\\"Members First\\") and publishing an alternative newsletter. Benson put together a full slate of officers and formally launched his campaign at PEF's October 1996 convention.Metzgar, \\"Another Bitter Race Is Possible At PEF,\\" Albany Times- Union, October 19, 1996. Benson announced a four-part platform: 1) Establishment of a PEF department focused on protecting employment security; 2) Budgeting substantial resources to enforce the Civil Service merit system; 3) Employment of a full-time professional contract negotiator; and 4) Elimination of officer perks.Metzgar, \\"Challenger Blames PEF President for 3 Years Without Pay Hikes,\\" Albany Times-Union, October 23, 1996. A third candidate, Jim Israel (a PEF shop steward), entered the race in January 1997 but withdrew when he was unable to obtain enough signatures to secure his nomination.Metzgar, \\"3rd Candidate Enters Race for PEF Presidency,\\" Albany Times-Union, January 16, 1997.

Sheedy and Benson battled over the state pension surplus,Metzgar, \\"PEF Hopefuls Battle Over Pension Costs,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 14, 1997. and engage in a letter-to-the-editor war in the newspapers.Metzgar, \\"State's 3 Major Public-Worker Unions Set to Elect Officers,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 23, 1997. Benson promised not to raise dues and re-open union offices, while Sheedy admitted a dues hike might be necessary in 1999.Metzgar, \\"PEF President Debates Tough Challenger,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 28, 1997. In June 1997, Benson defeated Sheedy by a vote of 11,407 to 8,956.Metzgar, \\"PEF Votes to Jettison Its President Once Again,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 25, 1997. Benson presidency Roger Benson made immediate changes in the way PEF conducted its business. He dismissed six staff members and returned to having two administrators share duties over the daily operation of the union.Metzgar, \\"PEF Leader to Fire 6 Staffers,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 3, 1997. He also named two close associates to the staff, and criticized the decision of the Sheedy-led executive board for enhancing the staff's severance packages. Local newspapers called the changes \\"bloodletting\\", and reported that additional layoffs were likely to come.\\"PEF Chief Dispatches Top Staffers,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 14, 1997. Among PEF's major political initiatives at this time were a cost-of-living increase for worker pensions.\\"Unions Want A Crack at Budget Surplus,\\" Albany Times-Union, January 7, 1998; Odato, \\"Bruno, Silver Promise Pension Reform Push,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 6, 1998; Odato, \\"Unions Offer Compromise for COLA,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 12, 1998; Odato, \\"Legislature to OK State Pension Hikes,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 18, 1998. Benson also said he would seek improvements to job security; accrual (rather than use-or-lose) for overtime, sick leave, and vacation; eliminate tiers in the pension plan; seek an end to penalties for early retirement; new workplace safety protections; an increase in the size of the state workforce; and new restrictions on contracting out.Odato, \\"State to Grapple With Unions,\\" Albany Times-Union, January 3, 1999. The state replied that it would seek a four-year wage freeze.Jakes, \\"PEF Protests No- Raise Contract Offer,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 24, 1999. Angered by the state's response in a time of budget surpluses, Benson led PEF workers in an extensive lobbying effort.Odato, \\"State Workers Unions Decry 'Zero-Percent' Raises,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 29, 1999. He also said PEF would seek a three-year rather than four-year contract, and 5 percent per year wage increases. Benson also replaced the union's top negotiator in order to adopt a more aggressive stand with the state.Caher, \\"Public Employees Union Replaces Chief Negotiator,\\" Albany Times-Union, September 9, 1999. The state countered with a 3 percent per year salary increase over four years, coupled with new restrictions on time off for union business, higher health care costs, and new worktime reporting requirements (all of which PEF rejected).Caher, \\"PEF Leaders Reject State's Contract Offer,\\" Albany Times-Unionm October 2, 1999. At a rally at the state capital on January 5, 2000, some 5,000 (state estimate) to 25,000 (PEF estimate) workers peacefully confronted 25 Albany police and 300 New York State troopers.Benjamin, \\"State Employees Brave Cold to Ask Peacefully For A Raise,\\" Albany Times-Union, January 6, 2000; Jochnowitz, \\"Protest's Security at Question,\\" Albany Times-Union, January 7, 2000.

In April, PEF accepted a contract with the New York State Canal Corporation with a 3 percent per year salary hike.\\"PEF Accepts Canal Corp. Contract,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 5, 2000. Days later, after another state union accepted a contract containing a 13.6 percent raise over four years, about 2,000 PEF members held a noisy rally outside the governor's offices demanding faster negotiations.Jochnowitz, \\"PEF Blasts Slow Contract Talks,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 7, 2000. Two weeks afterward, PEF agreed to end its advertising campaign and rallies as a spur to negotiations.Jochnowitz, \\"CSEA Pact Wins; PEF Adopts New Strategy,\\" Albany Times-Unionm April 29, 2000.

Union members approved the contract by a vote of 33,899 to 2,876.Odato, \\"PEF Members Approve New Pact,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 12, 2000. Benson revealed a financial scandal in the union during his first term in office. In July 1999, PEF sued former president James Sheedy and other former officers for allegedly embezzling more than $62,000 from the union.\\"Suit Says Former Leaders Embezzled Union Money,\\" New York Times, July 19, 1999; Grace, \\"Union Accuses Ex-President of Embezzling Funds,\\" Albany Times-Union, July 17, 1999. The union's lawsuit said the officers reimbursed themselves financially for sick leave they never took. But the PEF executive board retroactively approved the sick leave buybacks in a private meeting in August 1999, forcing Benson to drop the lawsuit.\\"PEF Acts to Sanction Sick Leave Cash-Ins,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 30, 1999. Nonetheless, former PEF Secretary-Treasurer Patricia Ford was convicted of bribery in June 2003.\\"Former Union Secretary-Treasurer Convicted of Taking Bribe,\\" Associated Press, June 20, 2003. Benson was re-elected without opposition in late 2000. He and his slate of officers were easily renominated, while an opponent received only 17 of the necessary 4,998 signatures needed to run for office.\\"PEF President's Rival Falls Short on Nomination,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 4, 2000. During Benson's second term, several PEF members died during the September 11 attacks on New York City.

One of PEF's larger campaigns during Benson's time in office was fighting health care cutbacks in New York state. For several years, the union protested against staff layoffs and the closure of hospitals and other health care facilities.Crowley, \\"Unions Cry Out for Remedy to Hospital Proposal,\\" Albany Times-Union, December 14, 2006.Karlin, \\"More Suits Fight Hospital Closures,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 28, 2007.Benjamin, \\"Unions Protest Mental Health Moves,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 18, 2003. PEF also sought increases in the number of health care workers on staff, an end to mandatory overtime, and minimum worker-to-patient staffing ratios.Stashenko, \\"Union, Nurses Endorse Assembly Bills to Bolster Profession,\\" Associated Press, May 14, 2001; Odato, \\"State Union Nurses Press for Solutions to Shortage,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 15, 2001; Harlin, \\"Nurses Urge End to Forced Overtime,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 5, 2004; Wechsler, \\"Nurses Rally for End to Mandatory Overtime,\\" Albany Times Union, May 17, 2005. Benson was re- elected without opposition to a third term in 2003, the first time any PEF president had been elected to a third term.\\"PEF Union Members Elect President to 3rd Term,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 9, 2003; \\"Benson Wins Third Term As Union President,\\" Associated Press, May 8, 2003. Benson immediately entered into negotiations for a new contract after his re-election. Initially, PEF had hopes for easier contract negotiations after Governor Pataki fulfilled a promise to give PEF members three additional days of sick leave per year.Odato, \\"Sick-Day Award Adds Liability,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 4, 2003. But after working without a contract for a year, PEF members found that Pataki proposed contract concessions in order to bring the state's budget into balance.Chang, \\"Labor Unions Negotiate Contract As Work Force Declines,\\" Associated Press, January 28, 2004. In March 2004, after CSEA agreed to a four-year contract with an average 2.85 percent wage increase each year, Benson denounced Pataki's offer of 1 percent per year to PEF membersOdato, \\"CSEA, State Agree on 4-Year Contract,\\" Albany Times-Union, March 6, 2004. and a cap on state contributions to the employee pension fund.Odato, \\"Groups Eye Suit in Pension Battle,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 22, 2004. Once again, methods for accounting for working time became a major sticking point in the negotiations, with Benson characterizing this as a \\"deal-breaker.\\"Benjamin, \\"Time Issue Hangs Up PEF-State Deal,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 29, 2004. But in July 2004, PEF agreed to a new four-year contract which included salary increases of $800 in the first year; 2.5 percent, 2.75 percent, and 3 percent salary increases in the last three years; and a new \\"locality pay\\" increase for workers in the mid-Hudson Valley region (where the cost of living was significantly higher than surrounding areas).\\"State and Union Reach Contract Agreement,\\" Associated Press, July 19, 2004; Farrell, \\"PEF, State Ink Tentative Agreement,\\" New York Daily News, July 28, 2004. In February 2005, Benson declined to run for a fourth term in 2006.\\"PEF Leaders Announce They Won't Run Again,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 8, 2005. One of the final achievements of the Benson presidency was enactment of legislation requiring the state to disclose the number and amount of money spent on private contractors. PEF began its campaign in the fall of 2005, and Governor Pataki signed the legislation in March 2006.Fox, \\"State Must Stop Private Consultant Contracts,\\" Albany Times Union, August 24, 2005; Woodruff, \\"Union Pushes for Contract Disclosure Bill,\\" Albany Times Union,\\" November 22, 2005; Kriss, \\"Union: Inspectors A Waste of Money,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard,\\" November 22, 2005; \\"PEF Bills Keep Pushing for Tax Accountability,\\" Albany Times Union, February 24, 2006; Odato, \\"Opening Books On Contract Services,\\" Albany Times Union, March 23, 2006; \\"Pataki Signs Bill Sought By Union Against Consulting Contracts,\\" Associated Press, March 22, 2006. Brynien presidency Kenneth Brynien was elected PEF president over Michael Del Piano on June 27, 2006, by a vote of 7,874 to 7,024 (a margin of 850 votes, or 5.8 percent).\\"'Members 1st' Ticket Wins PEF Election,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 28, 2006; \\"PEF Vice- President Elected to Top Post,\\" Albany Business Review, June 28, 2006; \\"Cicero Man Elected to Lead Public Employees Union,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, June 28, 2006. Brynien said a major goal of his presidency would be to enhance PEF's legislative efforts in the state capital.Odato, \\"Union to Flex Political Power,\\" Albany Times-Union, December 18, 2006. Brynien and the union confronted a state proposal to close or merge several state-owned hospitals and other health care facilities during his first year in office. A state commission first proposed the plan in November 2006.Mulder and Kriss, \\"Privatizing University Hospital Debated,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, November 22, 2006; \\"Hospital Dilemma Waits On Spitzer,\\" Albany Times Union, November 29, 2006. Brynien and PEF strongly opposed the plan, claiming it would harm patients and lead to lower levels of care.Odato, \\"Hospital Closing Plan Gains Momentum,\\" Albany Times Union, December 2, 2006. PEF's parent union, SEIU, said it would not oppose the plan.\\"Hospital Closure Plan Debated Across State,\\" Albany Business Review, December 11, 2006; Mulder, \\"SEIU: We Won't Oppose Hospital Downsizing,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, December 7, 2006. PEF began a series of public protests and a legislative lobbying effort to prevent the closures and mergers.Mulder, \\"Four Unions at Hospital Start Ad Blitz,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, June 6, 2007. It also sued to prevent the plan from being implemented.Mulder, \\"Unions at Upstate Sue to Halt Changes,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, March 28, 2007; \\"Unions Sue New York Hospital Closing Commission,\\" Associated Press, March 27, 2007. Brynien negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement for PEF in 2008. Negotiations for the new contract were short and generated almost no public notice. The four-year contract's terms, which were retroactive to April 2007 (the date the old agreement expired), included an average 4 percent wage increase per year, higher pay for employees working in or near New York City, new health insurance benefits, and improved educational benefits.\\"State, PEF Announce Tentative 4-Year Contract,\\" Albany Times-Union, February 6, 2008.\\"NY Reaches Tentative Labor Contract With State Workers Union,\\" Associated Press, February 5, 2008; \\"New State Worker Contract Includes Higher Pay, Better Health Care,\\" Associated Press, April 12, 2008. About two-thirds of PEF members voted in contract approval balloting, with the pact receiving 97 approval for those who did vote.\\"PEF Members Approve New Contract With State,\\" Albany Times Union, April 12, 2008; \\"PEF Members Approve New Contract With State,\\" Associated Press, April 12, 2008. During Brynien's first term as president, PEF also won a long-sought ban on mandatory overtime. Legislation on the issue was introduced in May 2007,\\"Nurses Seek Relief From Mandatory Overtime,\\" Albany Times Union, May 23, 2007. and on June 18, 2008, Governor David Paterson signed into law a ban on mandatory overtime in state facilities.Gormley, \\"Legislature, Paterson Agree to School, Nurse, Energy Deal,\\" Associated Press, June 18, 2008. Three months later, PEF successfully lobbied the state legislature to provide for permanent collection of union dues and a \\"fair share\\" provision in the dues structure. Under prior New York State law, the state was required to collect dues on PEF's behalf (through the state's payroll system) and forward these monies to the union. Non-members were not required to pay dues to the union, even though the union was required by law to represent these workers. This law required renewal every two years. PEF had long sought a permanent version of the law, one which enacted a \\"fair share\\" provision requiring non-members to pay a portion of dues (for the services they received). The state legislature finally passed just such a law in July 2008, and it was signed into law by Governor Paterson.Peters, \\"Union Dues Now Permanently Mandatory for Public Employees,\\" New York Times, July 24, 2008. PEF also became embroiled in major battles with Governor Paterson over the state budget, which occupied much of the remainder of Brynien's first term and the first few years of his second. When the late-2000s recession severely depressed New York state tax revenues, Paterson demanded that PEF and other state employee unions re-open their contracts and adopt a wage freeze and other concessions to help the state balance its budget.Bauman, \\"NY Public Worker Unions Oppose Reopening Contracts,\\" Associated Press, November 10, 2008. PEF refused.Sichko, \\"Paterson Urged to Reconsider Union Layoffs,\\" Albany Business Review, March 31, 2009. PEF countered by suggesting a program of early retirement, which lawmakers began discussing.Goldberg, \\"State Workers Join Budget-Cutting Foes,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, November 18, 2008; Bauman, \\"Early Retirement Possibility for State Employees\\", Associated Press, December 2, 2008. PEF also demanded that the state cut the number of independent contractors working for the state, arguing that New York could save up to $700 million by reducing the number of contractors or reducing payments to them.Matthews, \\"Public-Employee Union Urges State to Cut Consultants,\\" Elmira Star-Gazette, December 4, 2008; Gallagher, \\"Union Wants State to Rein in Spending on Consultants,\\" Ithaca Journal, December 4, 2008; Matthews, \\"Union Wants State to Rein in Consultant Hiring,\\" Westchester Journal News, December 4, 2008; Gallagher, \\"Consultants An Issue As Wrangling Over N.Y.

PEF also urged the state to adopt higher taxes on the very wealthy and for-profit health maintenance organizations, which the legislature did. Governor Paterson, determined to achieve spending cuts, ordered the layoff of more than 8,900 state workers on March 24, 2009.Gormley, \\"NY Gov. Orders 8,900 Layoffs,\\" Associated Press, March 24, 2009; Hakim and Confessore, \\"With No Union Concessions, State Plans to Cut 9,000 Jobs,\\" New York Times, March 25, 2009.

Led by PEF, the state's public employee unions produced television commercials and newspaper advertisements depicting Paterson with his fingers in his ears and unwilling to listen to voters.Peters, \\"Unions Go on Attack Over Paterson's Layoff Threat,\\" New York Times, April 14, 2009. The New York Times said that attacks were some \\"of the nastiest and most personal against a governor in memory ... rare even by Albany's relaxed standards of political decorum.\\" Brynien said Paterson should be faulted for forcing the unions into such an aggressive stand. Brynien also announced PEF would sue the state to prevent the layoffs from occurring.Sichko, \\"Unions to Paterson: See You in Court,\\" Albany Business Review, April 8, 2009; Karlin, \\"Unions Rail Against Layoff Plan,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 9, 2009; Gormley, \\"NY Union Bosses Say Layoffs Would Threaten Lives,\\" Associated Press, April 9, 2009. In response, Paterson said he would not lay off any workers if the state's unions agreed to a pension plan (\\"Tier V\\") for new workers that would provide much lower benefits.Odato, \\"Paterson: Pensions on the Table,\\" Albany Times-Union, April 11, 2009. PEF reached an agreement with the governor under which Paterson agreed not to lay off workers in exchange for a $20,000 bonus to 4,000 highly paid workers if they retired early within the next year; the abolition of 2,500 vacant jobs; the creation of a new tier in the pension system which would save $440 million over two years; and the introduction of a plan for workers to voluntarily cut back their working hours.Virtanen, \\"Paterson Deal With Unions to Avoid Layoffs,\\" Associated Press, June 5, 2009; Matthews, \\"Gov., Unions Reach Deal,\\" Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, June 6, 2009; Lisberg, \\"Paterson and Unions Set to Avoid Layoffs With Pension, Buyout Deal,\\" New York Daily News, June 5, 2009; Odato, \\"State Workers Await $20,000 Deal,\\" Albany Times-Union, June 5, 2009; Karlin, \\"Tier V Praised As Saving Billions,\\" Albany Times-Union, December 11, 2009. Brynien was re-elected as PEF's president in June 2009 after no opposition candidate emerged.Halbrook, \\"PEF Top Officers Get New 3-Year Terms,\\" PEF Communicator, June 2009. In October 2009, PEF also fought a campaign to prevent the state from ordering the mandatory vaccination of thousands of state health care workers against the H1N1 flu virus (popularly known as the \\"swine flu\\"). The state ordered the mandatory vaccinations on September 30, 2009. Brynien and other PEF leaders demanded that the state make the vaccinations voluntary, arguing that the mass vaccination plan did not provide for exemptions for worker safety, such as pregnant women or those with severe allergies; the vaccine had not yet been properly tested for safety; and the vaccine did not provide enough protection to outweigh the invasion of civil rights.Mulder, \\"Up In Arms Over Mandatory Flu Shots,\\" Syracuse Post- Standard, October 2, 2009. PEF sued, and on October 15 a state court agreed and imposed a temporary injunction preventing implementation of the plan.\\"NY Judge Temporarily Blocks Mandatory Flu Vaccines,\\" Associated Press, October 16, 2009; Matthews, \\"Union Gets Restraining Order On State's H1N1 Mandate,\\" Westchester Journal News, October 17, 2009; Hartocollis and Chan, \\"Albany Judge Blocks Vaccination Rule,\\" New York Times, October 17, 2009; Mulder, \\"Judge Blocks Forced Flu Shots,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, October 17, 2009; Crowley, \\"Court Halts Flu Order\\" Albany Times Union, October 17, 2009; \\"Public-Workers Union Sues State Over H1N1 Vaccine Mandate,\\" Poughkeepsie Journal, October 16, 2009. The state withdrew its plan a week later.Bauman, \\"NY Officials Rescind Mandatory H1N1 Flu Shot Order,\\" Associated Press, October 23, 2009. Six months after the pension deal was reached, however, Governor Paterson announced he would seek to prevent PEF members from receiving their scheduled 4 percent salary increase and seek furloughs of state workers to help close yet another budget deficit. Paterson raised the issues of furloughs in mid-August, just two months after the pension deal was reached.Demare, \\"Unions Fighting Forced Days Off,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 12, 2009. PEF countered once again by arguing that the state spent $3 billion a year on 23,000 consultants at a cost that was 62 percent higher than hiring a permanent worker.\\"Union, Assembly Push to End 'Temporary' Hires,\\" Associated Press, January 14, 2010. On April 1, 2010, Paterson demanded that PEF forgo its scheduled wage hike, but PEF refused to do so.Spector, \\"Paterson Calls On Unions to Forgo Raises,\\" Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, April 2, 2010; Precious, \\"Unions Reject Governor On Wage Freeze,\\" Buffalo News, April 2, 2010.

Governor Paterson then proposed laying off 10,000 state workers on January 1, 2011 (the day after his no-layoff pledge with the unions expired)‚Äîa plan PEF also opposed.Madore, \\"Paterson, Silver Warn of Layoffs,\\" Newsday, May 18, 2010; Virtanen, \\"NY Governor Planning for Mass State Worker Layoffs,\\" Associated Press, June 1, 2010; Precious, \\"Paterson Will Target State Layoffs Jan. 1,\\" Buffalo News, June 2, 2010; Confessore, \\"Paterson Defends Layoff Plan, Blaming Union Leaders,\\" New York Times, June 2, 2010; Dicker, \\"Gov Sharpens Ax ‚Äì Laying Groundwork for Layoffs,\\" New York Post, June 2, 2010; Madore and Epstein, \\"Paterson Plans For Layoffs,\\" Newsday, June 2, 2010; Confessore, \\"Governor Now Focuses On Layoffs to Cut Budget,\\" New York Times, June 1, 2010. On June 1, 2010, during the height of the tension created by the fiscal crisis, The New York Post ran an article revealing that Ken Brynien had enjoyed an increase in salary of $25,000 annually from $112,440 in 2008 to $137,622 in 2010. Kent presidency On June 25, 2012, Susan Kent, a credentialing specialist at the New York State Education Department, defeated Ken Brynien, 8,739 to 7,562. Roughly a third of all eligible PEF members cast votes. Carlos Garcia, a member of Kent's \\"NY Union Proud\\" slate, defeated PEF Secretary-Treasurer Joe Fox, 8,111 to 8,063. A number of NY Union Proud members also won election to the PEF executive board. Kent pledged during the campaign to be tougher in negotiations with the state. Political activity Although PEF was politically active in the first eight years of its existence, it was not notably so. That changed in 1986, the first time the Public Employees Federation engaged in an organized, statewide legislative lobbying effort (it sought passage of a \\"toxic tort\\" bill which would permit individuals harmed by exposure to toxic substances a longer period of time to file a lawsuit to recover damages).Chalmers, \\"PEF Members Launch Statewide Lobbying Effort,\\" Albany Times-Union, May 6, 1986. PEF also contributed $150,000 to state political campaigns in the first six months of 1986, ranking it among the top PACs in the state.Roth, \\"PEF Boosts Its Political Contributions to Gain Influence,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 3, 1986. This was more money than PEF had contributed in all of 1984 (the previous election cycle). PEF quickly became noted for the amount of money it spent on election efforts and on campaigns to oppose legislation it disagreed with. In 1987, PEF spent $36,822 on state political party-building efforts, more than any other group in New York State.\\"New York Lobbyists Spent $17 Million in '87,\\" Associated Press, March 13, 1988. In 1988, PEF spent $570,841 on political campaigns‚Äîbehind only the New York State AFL-CIO ($1 million), the Civil Service Employees Association ($704,875), and the Medical Society of the State of New York ($695,275).Lynn, \\"Campaign-Fund Hearings End Quietly,\\" New York Times, March 18, 1989. PEF spent $25,000 on an advertising campaign in the spring of 1990 to fight a plan to privatize state mental health services.Sack, \\"Cuomo Turning Budget Gap Into Tool to Sell Policy Shifts,\\" New York Times, February 21, 1991. In 1991, PEF spent $200,000 on an advertising campaign to defeat reductions in the state workforce and another $150,000 to support incumbents in state legislative election campaigns.Sack, \\"Cuomo Plan: Protect Jobs, Raise Taxes,\\" New York Times, May 10, 1990. It also spent at least $1 million that year on television ads urging the state legislature to pass higher state income and sales taxes.Purdum, \\"Realtors' Ads To Protest Rise in Taxes,\\" New York Times, April 2, 1991. In 1995, PEF ranked third among PACs in spending on state-level elections in New York, pumping $419,928 into these races.Dao, \\"Once Again, Record Levels Of Lobbying,\\" New York Times, March 16, 1995. In 2006, newly elected PEF President Kenneth Brynien, who had been a PEF vice-president for three years and chairman of PEF's political action committee for nine years, pledged to further boost PEF's political influence. PEF has also been active in endorsing candidates for political office. But some of these endorsements have proven highly contentious within the union. In 1990, PEF endorsed Mario Cuomo for governor, but the endorsement was bitterly debated within the union and the support PEF pledged to Cuomo's re-election effort was considered \\"tepid\\".Precious, \\"PEF Leaders Fight Over Gubernatorial Endorsement,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 14, 1990; Precious, \\"PEF Gives Cuomo Tepid Endorsement,\\" Albany Times-Union, August 15, 1990. PEF remained neutral in Cuomo's 1994 re-election campaign.\\"Cuomo Wins Endorsement From Teachers,\\" New York Times, August 11, 1994; Precious, \\"PEF Jilts Cuomo,\\" Albany Times- Union, August 6, 1994. Cuomo was defeated for re-election by George Pataki. PEF remained neutral again during Pataki's successful 1998 re-election bid.Perez-Pena, \\"Taking a Political Detour, Unions Shift Into Neutral,\\" New York Times, September 1, 1998. But in 2002, PEF supported Pataki for election to a third term.Gormley, \\"Pataki Lands White-Collar Union Support,\\" Associated Press, August 2, 2002. According to PEF President Roger Benson, the endorsement was a quid pro quo for Pataki's promise to add three days of paid sick leave to the union's collective bargaining agreement and for a promise not to lay off any state workers in the following budget year.Dewan, \\"Some Members Balk at Union Support for Pataki,\\" New York Times, October 1, 2002. Some PEF members were deeply angered by the union's endorsement, however, and an internal union poll of the union's health care division showed they overwhelmingly supported Pataki's opponent (New York Comptroller H. Carl McCall). Pro-McCall members of the union submitted a resolution to the union's annual convention which would have rescinded the endorsement. PEF members voted down the resolution on October 8, 2002.Hern√°ndez and Archibold, \\"As Teachers Back Pataki, McCall Questions Motives,\\" New York Times, October 9, 2002. In 2006, PEF endorsed New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in his successful run for governor.\\"State Employee Union Endorses Spitzer,\\" Albany Business Review, June 9, 2006. That same year, Andrew Cuomo ran to replace Spitzer as New York State Attorney General. PEF declined to endorse Cuomo, instead backing New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green in his unsuccessful bid for that office.Odato, \\"Cuomo Secures Union Backing,\\" Albany Times Union, August 15, 2006. On July 21, 2009, PEF leaders indicated they might not support David Paterson in the Democratic primary if he chooses to run for re-election as governor.Hernandez, \\"Unions May Drop Paterson in 2010,\\" New York Times, July 22, 2009.

Origins The magazine was conceived in an atmosphere of intellectual crisis, following the brain drain from Nigeria, during the Sani Abacha regime. It was founded by Olakunle Tejuoso and his brother Toyin (whose family owns the Lagos alternative bookstore, after which the journal is named). Olakunle wanted to create a forum where people could access the work being done by Nigerian intellectuals who had fled the country, and a bridge for artistic theories and activities being propagated by African intellectuals in the West and their contemporaries at home. Although it was initially focused on Nigeria's arts and cultures, Glendora grew into a pan African journal with regular features and interviews of icons, such as Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, Mbongeni Ngema, Sembene Ousmane, Sun Ra, and other critical texts on African literature. The journal also included a books supplement. The last issue of Glendora appeared in 2004, and its publishers have since focused on the publication of books, such as Lagos: A City At Work on the West African megapolis, . Scope The magazine constantly engages and interrogates the idea of Africa, as a contested and dynamic invention, Glendora provided a platform for intellectual discourse on literary, visual and performance cultures that are sensitive to the mutations and complexities of cultural work on Africa in a global age. A strong aesthetic sense coupled with an editorial style that (while rigorous) managed to avoid being too intellectual or esoteric, attracted a wide-ranging readership in Nigeria and abroad. Critical assessment Reviewing the influence of Glendora Today on the younger generation of Nigerian writers, African Literature Today writes: \\"Indeed there may be said to be a Glendora Group or a Glendora Generation, made up of those who as critics or poets, and guided by Dapo Adeneyi, published in the journal.\\" Notes Category:1994 establishments in Nigeria Category:Magazines established in 1994 Category:Magazines published in Nigeria Category:Quarterly magazines Category:Cultural magazines ","title":"Glendora Review"},{"id":"18661163","text":"St Mary's Cathedral, Banjul The Diocese of Gambia and Guinea was founded in 1935 and had been renamed the Diocese of Gambia and The Rio Pongas by 1940.Crockford Clerical Directory, 1941 edition, appendix list of dioceses and bishops.

The Province of West Africa has now grown to include 17 dioceses, and in 2014 was sub-divided into two internal provinces (West Africa and Ghana), each led by a metropolitan archbishop. Diocesan institutions The first Anglican mission church in The Gambia was established in 1855. Early church missions were established by the USPG and Church Mission Society. Early mission stations and chaplaincies formed the initial parishes of the new diocese upon its formation in 1935. The cathedral church of the diocese is St Mary's Cathedral, which was built in 1901 in Bathurst, The Gambia, now Banjul. The diocese has active components of the Mothers' Union and the Anglican Young Peoples Association. In 2012 the diocesan synod committed to establishing local branches of both organisations in every parish, with a view to developing the role of both women and young people in church life.Press report at Anglican Communion News Service.

Though Monteros had been known as a little village years before. Monteros eventually acquired the rank of municipality on December 12, 1867 with its first mayor Don Domingo Segundo Ar√°oz. It has been one of the most renowned and prosperous towns from southern Tucum√°n due to its cultural, educative and commercial life. Toponimy There have been several versions about the origin of the town's name. One version suggests that some inhabitants of the old San Miguel de Tucum√°n, which used to be on a place currently known as Ibat√≠n, refused to move to the new location and declared in rebellion, taking refuge in the nearby hills. The name may have derived from \\"people of the hill\\" (Monte in Spanish). Another version says that the remaining inhabitants of the old San Miguel de Tucum√°n founded Monteros on October 4, 1865, naming it the Town of the Holy Rosary of Monteros. There were three attempts to rename the town. In 1828 and 1832 Villa Belgrano was the name proposed, in honor of Manuel Belgrano but it did not succeed. The strangest case was in 1932 when the then provincial governor, Alejandro Heredia, attempted to rename it to Alexandria, in his own honor. Economy The main use of agriculture in the local economy is the sugar industry. The √ëu√±orco plant (founded in 1926) is the main industrial plant in the town.

History  Spencer Road halt is not shown on this 1908 Railway Clearing House map but it was () between and on the joint London, Brighton and South Coast and South Eastern and Chatham Railways. The site is hidden in an alleyway between Spencer Road and Birdhurst Rise in South Croydon. The railway had hoped that passengers would change to the Brighton Line by making the ten-minute walk to South Croydon station but very few did. Spencer Road was among several new stations and halts opened in the suburbs, including Reedham and Bandon, to compete with the convenience of electric trams and to a lesser extent omnibuses, whose effect was being felt on railway income particularly with regard to shorter journeys. This map, still on display at Victoria Station, describes it as a \\"motor halt\\" (key to symbols) Apart from a metal footbridge which carried the path between Spencer Road and Birdhurst Rise over the line, the halt consisted of just a pair of wooden platforms and nameboards. Oil lamps were also likely to have been provided. The platforms were reached from wooden gates on either side of the footbridge; a notice adjoining the gate was headed \\"Woodside and South Croydon Railway\\" and warned passengers against taking a short-cut over the railway line and use the footbridge. The halt closed in 1915 as a wartime economy, but remained intact until at least 1931. The remains were cleared by the Southern Railway in preparation for reopening and electrification of the line in 1935. An up starter signal for Selsdon on a post made of old rails was subsequently installed on the site of the Up platform, and during the Second World War a tank trap was built on the site of the Down platform.  Present day  The halt has been demolished but the footbridge remains in use. the double track was still in situ but heavily overgrown. The nearby overbridge crossing Croham Road is also extant.
