It is housed in the first and second floors of the Porta San Sebastiano at the beginning of the Appian Way. It provides an exhibition on the walls of Rome and their building techniques, as well as the opportunity to walk along the inside of one of the best-preserved stretches of the Aurelian Wall. The museum is free of charge. History The museum in its present form, was officially opened in 1990. Prior to 1939, the Porta San Sebastiano (also known as the Porta Appia) had been open to the public but it was then taken over by Ettore Muti, the Secretary of the Italian Fascist Party.https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/attractions/porta-san- sebastiano-museo-delle-mura/a/poi-sig/390015/359975 White-and-black mosaics in some rooms date back to that time. From 1970, there was a small museum connected to the internal parapet of the Aurelian Wall but this museum was only open to the public on Sundays, and, after a few years, was closed. Exhibition The museum provides a detailed history of wall construction in Rome and the surrounding areas, with information going back to one constructed in Ardea to the southeast of Rome in the 8th century. It describes the construction methods of the first Roman wall, built by Servius Tullius the legendary sixth king of Rome, the second wall constructed in the 4th century BC after invasion of Rome by the Gauls, and the Aurelian Walls, constructed in the 3rd century CE, as well as subsequent work to raise the height of those walls and improve defences, and more recent additions and changes up to the 20th century. In addition to text and diagrams, some models of walls are provided.https://www.timeout.com/rome/museums/museo-delle-mura View from the walkway accessed through the museum The rooms * Room 1 This is a reception room, in the west tower of the Gate. It can be used for video projections. The room has one of the Fascist era mosaics showing a tiger ambushing two deer. * Room 2 This occupies the first floor, standing over the arch of the Porta S. Sebastiano. There are informative panels about the earliest walls and the subsequent Aurelian Walls. The construction of the Aurelian walls was the largest building project that had taken place in Rome for some time, and their construction was a statement of the continued strength of Rome.Aldrete, Gregory S (2004). Daily Life In The Roman City: Rome, Pompeii, And Ostia, Greenwood Press, 2004, pp. 41-42. The exhibits explain the events that necessitated their construction, and the reasons for the choice of the path followed. The panels also describe the building techniques and the types of gate. There is also a panel dedicated to military equipment used both by defenders and attackers. One of the exhibitions * Room 3 This room, in the east tower, has models of walls and a topographic plan of ancient Rome and the routes of the first three walls. * Room 4 This room provides information about the Ports San Sebastiano and other gates in the walls of Rome. * Room 5 The room provides information about the Appian Way, the beginning of which can be seen from the windows. * Room 6 This discusses developments and restorations up to the present day. * Room 7 This contains a model of wall fortifications designed by Antonio da Sangallo (1453-1534). * Terrace and walkway The terrace of the Porta San Sebastiano can be visited together with a 350-meter stretch of the inside of the Aurelian Wall going west as far as the Via Cristoforo Colombo, in a covered gallery interrupted by ten towers. Remains of the original flooring can be noted. Arrow slits for archers can be seen, as well as staircases inside several of the towers which used to lead to the command rooms. Restoration work can be distinguished by the various types of construction technique. Squared arrow slits from 1848 can also be seen. These were the result of adaptations made to adapt the original slits for artillery.

The newspaper serves Norwalk and the rest Huron County, plus the Milan and Berlin Heights communities in southern Erie County. The Norwalk Reflector is located at 61 E. Monroe St. in Norwalk, Ohio It is part of the Sandusky Newspaper Group ‚Äî a seven-paper organization based in Sandusky, Ohio. The SNG papers are the Grand Haven (Mich.) Tribune, Johnson City (Tenn.) Press, Kingsport (Tenn.) Times- News, Lebanon (Tenn.) Democrat, Norwalk Reflector and the Sandusky Register. The group recently announced the sale of the Standard-Examiner to the Provo Daily Herald. History The Norwalk Reflector's first home, then located on West Main Street, now serves as the home of the Firelands Museum, now on Case Avenue. The Reflector issued its first edition on Feb. 2, 1830. Owners of the new project were Samuel Preston and George Buckingham. The latter gentleman had been a co-owner of Norwalk's very first newspaper, the Reporter. The Reporter ceased to exist in 1830. The Firelands Historical Society preserves an original file, which has also been microfilmed and is available at the public library. The first Reflector office was in the second story of a mercantile building at 9 W. Main St. Samuel Preston's daughter, Lucy, married Frederick Wickham in January 1835. Samuel soon bought the lot at 38 W. Main St. (next to the present public library), and in the summer of 1835 began building a building there. This building was completed and occupied in 1836, and since being moved in 1954, houses the museum of the Firelands Historical Society. It was planned that the Prestons and Wickhams would occupy the first floor and basement, with the newspaper office on the second floor. There are marks in the flooring said to have been made by the Stanbury press used in the earliest time. A year or so into the venture, the editor announced that the paper being used was ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù in Norwalk by the Norwalk Manufacturing Company. Before the first Reflector was ever issued, Preston and Buckingham pondered over an appropriate name. It is a family story that Samuel Preston was in the taproom of Obadiah Jenney's Mansion House hotel (where the Chamber of Commerce is now) and noticed a reflector lamp or candle holder on the wall. It suddenly occurred to him that ‚ÄúReflector‚Äù would be a good name, on the premise that the paper would ‚Äúreflect‚Äù the news. The newspaper office moved out of the house when both the paper and the growing Wickham family needed more room. Lucy Preston's husband, Frederick Wickham, took over editorship of the paper, and it stayed in the family until a century ago. In 1913 it was purchased by R. C. Snyder, who already owned the Norwalk Evening Herald. The papers were combined into the Norwalk Reflector-Herald, and every so often you hear an old-timer refer to the paper as the Reflector-Herald ... but not too often any more. Mr. Snyder was president of the Associated Ohio Dailies and the vice-president of the World Press Congress prior to his death in 1941. The publication was subsequently purchased by Dudley A. White, Mrs. Dudley A. White, Mrs. Alice White Rau and Dudley White, Jr. Inasmuch as he is a son-in- law of the late R.G. Snyder, and James G. Gibbs was the son-in-law of Frederick Wickham, who in turn, was the son-in-law of the founder, Samuel Preston, it can be said that two families have owned the Reflector throughout the 188-plus years it has been a ‚Äúpart and parcel‚Äù of Norwalk's history. Modern newspaper The newspaper now is located at 61 E. Monroe St. Andrew Prutsok is the publisher and Joe Centers is the managing editor. Matt Roche is news editor, Mark Hazelwood is sports editor, and Cary Ashby and Zoe Greszler are staff writers. Ashley Pitts serves as the newsroom clerk and Don Hohler is the librarian. Regular newsroom contributors include Natalie Bowers, Jim Busek, Caiten Cameron, Don Hohler, Debbie Leffler, Madeline Roche, Amy Russell, Richard Russell, Ellen Simmons and Henry Timman.

Finding Mewar unprotected, the Sultan of Malwa, Mahmud Khalji, burning with a desire to take revenge and wipe off the disgrace of his defeat in A.D 1440 (Battle of Mandavgad), invaded Mewar. Destruction of Bana Mata Temple Arriving near Kumbalmer the Sultan prepared to destroy the temple of Bana Mata in Kelwara. A Rajput chieftain named Deep Singh collected his warriors and opposed the Sultan. For seven days Deep Singh successfully repulsed all attempts of the Sultans army to take possession of the temple. On the seventh day, Deep Singh was killed and the temple fell into the hands of the Sultan. He razed it to the ground and destroyed the stone image that was kept in the temple. Flushed with success, he started for Chittor, and leaving a part of his army to take the fortress, advanced to attack Rana Kumbha, sending his father, Azam Humayun, towards Mandsaur to lay waste to the Rana's country. Battle of Mandalgarh When Rana Kumbha heard of these events, he left Haraoti to return to his dominions and came upon the Sultan's army near Mandalgarh. A battle was fought here without any decisive result. A few days later the Rana made another attack on the Sultan who was utterly defeated and fled towards Mandu. Battle of Banas To retrieve this disaster, Mahmud set about preparing another army, and four years later, on 11-12 October 1446 A.D. he went towards Mandalgarh with a large army.

Biography Kathleen Farrell was born in London on 4 August 1912. The daughter of a wealthy builder, she was financially independent throughout her life. During World War II, she served as an assistant to Hastings Lees- Smith, the secretary general of the Labour Party. Following the war, she founded a literary agency called Gilbert Wright. Farrell's first book, Johnny's Not Home from the Fair (1942), was in part a ghost story and its dedication‚Äî\\"For my mother, without her permission\\"‚Äîhinted at autobiographical elements. Following this, she wrote five novels of life in the 1950s: Mistletoe Malice (1951), Take It to Heart (1953), The Cost of Living (1956), The Common Touch (1958), and Limitations of Love (1962). In Limitations of Love the characters Mr Flask & Mrs Walk appear, which is a play on Flask Walk in Hampstead where Farrell lived with Kay Dick. Farrell, who was typically compared to Barbara Pym in contemporary reviews, was known for her sharp depictions of character, frequently verging on the cynical. C. P. Snow praised Mistletoe Malice as a \\"savagely witty and abnormally penetrating\\" study of a dysfunctional family collected together at Christmas. The Cost of Living is a darkly humorous portrait of two impoverished women‚Äîa freelance typist and an artist‚Äîand their attempts to meet people and develop romantic relationships. A passage from this book gives a sense of Farrell's characteristically acerbic tone: :\\"By that time I had nearly finished the novel. It seemed to get longer and longer towards the end; and sadder, too, and much sillier. There was only one woman in it, and she spent most of her life retching and clinging to park railings; and when she wasn‚Äôt doing that she was leaning her forehead against the wall in some dark alleyway. Leaning her forehead against the wall was to stop her being completely overcome by nausea. I can‚Äôt remember that it ever did. I wondered how such young men managed to make women feel so sick, so often. And I thought, poor young men, how they suffer.\\" She was well connected in British literary circles, counting among her friends Ivy Compton-Burnett, Olivia Manning, Pamela Hansford Johnson, and Quentin Crisp, and she was known for encouraging up-and-coming writers. At the same time, it is said that she belonged to an informal group that has been called, quasi-jokingly, \\"The Lady Novelists' Anti-Elizabeth League,\\" whose members were apparently united in their dislike of the work of novelist Elizabeth Taylor. Other members of the league are said to have included Johnson, Manning, Kate O'Brien, and Kay Dick, who was Farrell's life partner for some twenty years. Farrell's novels, though critically well received, did not sell particularly well. She died in Hove, East Sussex, on 25 November 1999. Farrell's papers are held by the University of Texas, Austin, and include drafts and notes for several unpublished novels and stories.

Etymology  The generic name Caltha has been derived from the Greek kalathos 'goblet', refers to the form of the flower. The species epithet novae-zelandiae means of New Zealand.  Distribution and ecology  The New Zealand marsh marigold can be found in the mountains of North, South and Stewart Islands from the main axial ranges of the North Island south. It grows in alpine flushes, seepages, around lakes and slow streaming rivulets. It is also present in moist areas in open grassland, among herbs or between gravel.  Description  Caltha novae-zelandiae is a small (3‚Äì5 cm, exceptional up to 18 cm high), hairless, perennial herb. Plants form mats of rosettes. Its white rhizomes are stout and fleshy. The spade- shaped leaves have slender, grooved petioles of up to 10 cm long that form a membranous sheathing base. The leafblade is dark green and sometimes has a central blotch or it has bronze markings, are 8-25 √ó 4‚Äì12 mm with two lobes at its base, with an indent at its tip and entire or slightly scalloped edges. The basal lobes (or appendages) are mostly pressed against the upper surface of the leaf and, almost half as long. The flower grows from an initially short peduncle, that continues to grow till it is finally up to 18 cm long during fruiting. The five to seven pale yellow sepals are 1‚Äì3 cm long and 2‚Äì3 mm wide, 3-nerved, linear-ovate, widest between the base and half length, and have an acute tip. There are between fifteen and twenty stamens encircling six to twelve ovate carpels each about 4‚Äì5 mm long and topped by a stout style of about 2 mm. The fruiting heads are 12‚Äì18 mm across. There are usually two to five seeds per follicle, each 1.2-2.0 mm long, glossy red-brown to dark purple brown, ovate to broadly ovate, or elliptic ovate. Flowering occurs between September and December, and ripe fruits can be found from December until March. There are forty eight chromosomes (2n = 48).  Differences from related species  C. novae-zelandiae differs from Caltha obtusa by the linear yellow rather than oblong-obovate white sepals, and by the leaf margins which are slightly scalloped to entire rather than scalloped and almost lobed at the base.

Biography Rav Cherki was born in Algeria in 1959. His grandfather, Eyzer Cherki, was a Torah scholar and community leader in Algeria, and later in France. Eyzer served as the president of the Zionist Federation of Algeria, a representative at the Zionist Congress, and was active in founding Jewish education in Algeria. Rav Cherki's father was a businessman, held a doctorate in economics, and supported his grandfather in his public activities. Rav Cherki moved as a child to France for a number of years. He moved to Israel in 1972, where he studied at the \\"Netiv Meir\\" Yeshiva High School, and later at Merkaz Harav Yeshiva under Rav Zvi Yehuda Kook. He also studied under Rav Yehuda Leon Ashkenazi, Rav Meir Yehuda Getz, and Rav Shlomo Binyamin Ashlag. He performed his military service in the artillery branch of the IDF. Rav Cherki is involved with the organization Rosh Yehudi, and gives lectures around Israel, including specialized courses for Jewish educators on teaching Judaism to the general public.

He has disseminated his teachings primarily in lectures on a wide range of topics that draw on his broad knowledge base (Torah, philosophy, science, history, etc.).http://www.meirtv.co.il/site/rabbis.asp?rabbi=3774) Rav Cherki places a particular emphases on the meaning of Zionism and the establishment of the state of Israel. He asserts that the birth of modern political Zionism signified the \\"beginning of the redemption\\" (atchalta d'geulah), whose climax was the Balfour Declaration, and the founding of the State of Israel signified the final act in the process of redemption. Thus, from the perspective of Jewish law, the Jews are, today, already in the \\"period of the Messiah\\". This being the case, he also maintains that the ultimate purpose of the Jewish people is a universal one, and that is to bring blessing to all humanity, while respecting the distinct national identities within it, and not by the creation of a cosmopolitan \\"world-religion\\" that seeks to blur distinct national identities.Besheva newspaper, 31.03.16, http://en.calameo.com/read/0016608025ed16a124402 Therefore, he champions the unique viewpoint that with the establishment of the state of Israel, the time has come for the practical realization of this purpose, and calls for the Jewish people to actively pursue it. Part of this program is the publicizing and formalization of the Noahide movement through the organization Brit Olam, which Rav Cherki heads.http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/692/249.html) Published works Consistent with his method of teaching that emphasizes face-to-face instruction, Rav Cherki spends much time giving classes in various frameworks around Israel, averaging 20 classes a week.◊©◊ô◊¢◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ß◊ë◊ï◊¢◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ú ◊î◊®◊ë ◊ê◊ï◊®◊ô ◊©◊®◊ß◊ô.

His research is related to macro-level structure of the world economy, with a particular focus on China's global economic integration. He is an author of several books, numerous academic articles, and a contributor to Foreign Affairs, Al Jazeera English, Quadrant and Truthout. Biography He received PhD from Johns Hopkins University in 2003. From 2003 to 2008 he has been a professor of sociology at the University of Pittsburgh; since 2008 at the University of Sydney.

Work Babones has offered a reformulation of world-systems analysis that distinguishes five core elements of the perspective from ancillary theories that have been promulgated within that perspective. He added to these five core elements the \\"strong theorem\\" that the core-periphery hierarchy of the modern world-economy could best be understood in terms of state strength and cultural integration. He began to use the historical Chinese concept of tianxia (\\"all under heaven\\") to describe the structure of the millennial world-system as an American tianxia that has endogenized the entire world- economy under a single, American-dominated political system. He also writes on quantitative methodology for the social sciences. In 2018 he published a book on Donald Trump and his administration, dealing with modern meaning and framing of concepts such as democracy, populism and authoritarianism.

The site has been described as \\"Britain's Pompeii\\" due to its relatively good condition, including the \\"best-preserved Bronze Age dwellings ever found\\" there, which all appear to have been abandoned suddenly following a catastrophic fire. Research now suggests that the site was less than one year old at the time of destruction. The site is on the bed of a now-defunct river in Flag Fen basin, around south of Flag Fen itself. Must Farm was named Best Archaeological Project and Best Archaeological Discovery at the 2012 British Archaeological Awards, and Best Discovery at the 2016 Awards. An article describing the settlement won the Antiquity Prize 2020. Early excavations Wooden posts were first recognised there in 1999, leading to preliminary excavations in 2004 and 2006. Early finds at the site include a rapier and a sword in 1969. Between 2011 and 2012, eight Bronze Age log boats were discovered. The boats were found in a small freshwater palaeochannel and were preserved due to waterlogging. Radiocarbon dating has indicated that the ages of these boats spanned a period of about 1,000 years, with the earliest examples dating to around 1750‚Äì1650 BCE. Some of the boats may have been deliberately sunk. They are now preserved at Flag Fen and are available to view on guided tours. Bronze Age woven wooden fish traps and wattle-hurdle fish weirs were found in the same channel, together with metalwork including swords and spears. 2015/2016 excavation Simplified elevation cross-section of a typical house at Must Farm Simplified excavation site plan In September 2015, the University of Cambridge's Cambridge Archaeological Unit began a dig, eventually covering , the details of which were publicly disclosed in January 2016. Historic England funded a ¬£1.1 million project to excavate the site to gain as much knowledge of Bronze Age life in Britain as possible. Archaeologists found two roundhouses, from about 1000‚Äì800 BCE, and concluded that they were damaged by fire and that the platform on which they sat then slid into the river, where the fire was extinguished and the buildings and objects within them were preserved in the silt. About half of the settlement is thought to have been lost due to modern-day quarrying. Objects recovered include pots still containing food, textiles woven from lime tree bark and other plant fibres, sections of wattle walls, and glass beads. In 2016 a large wooden wheel of about in diameter was uncovered at the site. The specimen, dating from 1,100‚Äì800 years BCE, represents the most complete and earliest of its type found in Britain. The wheel's hub is also present. A horse's spine found nearby suggests the wheel may have been part of a horse-drawn cart. The find \\"expands our understanding of late Bronze Age technology\\", said Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, which was co-funding the project. , the archaeology had been removed and the site reburied to be left sealed.Mustfarm FAQs at mustfarm.com In 2019 researchers at Cambridge and Bristol universities revealed the results of a study of human and dog coprolites found at the site. They discovered the presence of fish tapeworms, echinostoma worms, capillaria worms and giant kidney worms. The research shows the earliest evidence of human infection by these parasites in Britain. The dig was the subject of a BBC Television documentary, Britain's Pompeii: A Village Lost in Time, first broadcast on BBC Four on 2 August 2016.

After attending Churchill High School in Potomac, Morales enrolled at George Washington University as a biology major. He planned on becoming a marine biologist. Career=Capitol Hill= Morales' first job out of college was as an aide to U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg. He initially focused on environmental issues before becoming a transportation specialist when Lautenberg was named chairman of the Senate transit appropriations subcommittee. Morales was a key drafter of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, a bill which first proposed a California high-speed rail corridor connecting San Diego and Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento through the San Joaquin Valley. In 1993, Morales was appointed as special assistant to Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena. In 1995, Morales began work with Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Task Review.

It is nationally recognized as a live-arts incubator for the cultural sector in the city. It also provide meeting space for Toronto residents. The Theatre Centre‚Äôs mission is to nurture artists, invest in ideas and champion new work and new ways of working. The Theatre Centre is located on what were traditional lands of the Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee and Huron- Wendat First Nation peoples.  History  The B.A.A.N.N. Theatre Centre was formed in 1979 by a co-operative of five independent theatre companies ‚Äì Buddies in Bad Times, Autumn Leaf Theatre, AKA Performance Interface, Necessary Angel, and Nightwood Theatre. These groups wanted a space to create, rehearse and present new works. By the mid-1980s, the founding companies had the Theatre Centre. In 1984, the R+D (Research and Development) program was established and became the leading proponent for theatrical exploration in the city. In 2004, R+D was replaced by a two-year Residency Program. Over the years, The Theatre Centre has supported many companies, productions, artists and ideas. Artists participating in this program have included Jennifer Tarver, Chris Leavins, Sarah Garton Stanley, bluemouth inc., Ame Henderson, ATSA, Cathy Gordon, Independent Aunties, Juliet Palmer, Michael Rubenfeld, One Reed Theatre, Jon McCurley & Ame Lam, Susanna Hood, and Ravi Jain. In 2002, The Theatre Centre presented its first Free Fall, a biennial festival for works from Canada and other countries. Franco Boni has been the Artistic Director of The Theatre Centre since 2003. In March 2014, Theatre Centre moved into the Carnegie Library building at 1115 Queen Street West following a $6.2 million redevelopment of the property.  Activities  The Theatre Centre pursues a mandate of supporting artists who wish to develop works of an experimental or alternative nature, that challenge the definitions of theatrical performance by embracing music, dance, visual art and new media. The company provides space, mentorship, exposure and a sense of community through a series of carefully conceived programs.  Caf√©/Bar  The Theatre Centre Caf√©/Bar provides refreshments and exhibits sculptural, video, and performance installations.  Programs = Residency = The Theatre Centre‚Äôs Residency Program is a structured two-year program that provides groups/artists with the necessary space, funding and mentorship to craft ideas into finished products. Residency facilitates a highly collaborative artistic process that brings together a variety of participants, both artists and non- artists. Residency has its roots in the previous R&D; programme, Participants in the R&D; programme have included Tomson Highway, Daniel Brooks, Daniel MacIvor, Alisa Palmer, Darren O‚ÄôDonnell, Alejandro Ronciera and Kelly Thornton. = Tracy Wright Global Archive = Launched in 2014 to honour the life of artist Tracy Wright, the Tracy Wright Global Archive is the project that challenges artists to explore a burning question and create a new work by engaging deeply with communities and locations across the globe. In its first year, the Theatre Centre gave four Canadian theatre artists the opportunity to travel to four locations around the world to investigate their own burning question:  Prophecy Fog  As part of the Archive project. Jani Lauzon traveled to Giant Rock in the Mojave Desert near Landers, California. Prophecy Fog, a new project emerging from Lauzon's investigation of this space, weaves together the performance skills of Lauzon, with the expertise of projection designer Alex Williams and the compositions of award winning composer Marsha Coffey, to elicit a conscious remembering of ancient prophecies that speak to rock teachings, star beings and earth changes.  Whose Revolution?  For his Archive project, Marcus Youssef arrived in Cairo on January 12, 2014, the evening of Egypt‚Äôs third constitutional referendum since 2011. He left two weeks later, the day after the revolution‚Äôs third anniversary. In between he was detained briefly by undercover police, witnessed his first car bomb, interviewed a dozen journalists, activists, academics and artists. He also spend time with his Egyptian family for the second time in his life. His question: what is a revolution? His current answer: a better question might be whose. Whose Revolution? is part memoir of a family and exile, part snapshot of a country in the midst of massive change, and part investigation into what we can ever claim to actually know about another culture or place.  Walk When You Walk  For her Archive project Denise Fujiwara investigated the notion of walking as a medium for transformation. She visited the path of the Shikoku Pilgrimage on the island of Shikoku in Japan. Fujiwara invited small groups to walk in a contemplative way through The Theatre Centre‚Äôs neighbourhood. Fujiwara shared perspectives and koans that aimed to allow participants to experience time, space and themselves in ways that belie the seeming simplicity of the act of walking.  What Happened to the Seeker?  For her Archive project, Nadia Ross went to India and asked the question What Happened to the Seeker? The project is a story told in three mediums: exhibit, video and performance. Her aim was to find out what happened to that original impulse and asks: how could that collective desire for truth end in such disappointment? As she walks the path of the original Seekers, she does comes face to face with the ‚Äúthing that was never lost and that can never be found‚Äù, and shares her discovery in a story told in triptych form. = Progress Festival = Progress is an international festival of performance and ideas presented by the SummerWorks Performance Festival in partnership with The Theatre Centre. The festival is collectively produced by a series of Toronto-based curating companies, operating within a contemporary performance context.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 5.65, it is faintly visible to the naked eye. (According to the Bortle scale, it can be viewed from dark rural skies.) The high declination of +82.5¬∞ means it is hidden from view from most of the southern hemisphere. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of around 143 light years from the Sun. If it was instead positioned at a distance of , this would be a second magnitude star. This is an F-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of F9 V. It is estimated to have 51% greater mass than the Sun, and is younger with an age of around 2.8 billion years. The projected rotational velocity along the star's equator is a relatively leisurely 5.2 km/s. The star is considered a photometric solar analog, although it is deficient in elements more massive than helium when compared to the Sun. The chemical composition and relatively low surface gravity for a star of its classification suggest that this may instead be a subgiant star that is in the process of evolving away from the main sequence. The effective temperature of the star's photosphere is 5,599 K, giving it the yellow-white hue of an F-type star. This star has been examined for evidence of an infrared excess, but none was detected. During a 2006‚àí2007 survey of nearby stars, it was discovered that HD 133002 has a low-mass common proper motion stellar companion. This object has an estimated 15% of the Sun's mass.

Biography In the early 1980s, Andreas Tomalla (aka Talla 2XLC) began his career as a DJ in Frankfurt, and put on preferably Kraftwerk and Depeche Mode. Together with Ralf Henrich (aka RaHen), he founded the band Moskwa TV, with a very modern techno sound for the time. The ground-breaking debut album Dynamics & Discipline was mainly composed by Talla and RaHen, and produced by Kurt Ader and Axel Henninger / Naskrent in the Dynaton Studio. Vocalist Ion Javelin (Jan Veil) joined during the production of the debut album at the recommendation of label CBS to the band. At CBS, he had released his first single, \\"Dancing in Heaven\\", under the pseudonym Gary Chandler, with little commercial success. RaHen and Javelin together composed the song \\"Generator 7/8\\". The singles \\"Generator 7/8\\" and \\"Tekno Talk\\" were released and gained popularity in various clubs in the Frankfurt techno scene and then at larger venues. The release of the second studio album Blue Planet (1987) led to disputes between the band members. Talla 2XLC thought Ion Javelin had too much clout over the band, so he looked for a new singer. However he disliked the candidates and backpedaled, bringing Javelin back to the band. Talla 2XLC then left the band because of disputes with Axel Henninger and Ion Javelin concerning the rights to the band's songs. In 1988, Axel Henninger left Moskwa TV, due to money disputes about his producer activity with the label Westside. The naming rights remained with Ion Javelin, whose label Westside agreed with Talla 2XLC financially. Axel Henninger has since made a name for himself as a producer, lyricist and composer. He produced Camouflage, Paddy Goes To Holyhead, Okay, Deborah Sasson, Chandeen, X-Perience, and De/Vision. In 2003, Javelin released the album Broken Surface together with Chandeen's Harald L√∂wy.

He began his life of organized crime as a member of the Montreal- based motorcycle gang called the Popeyes Motorcycle Club. By the mid-1970s, he became president. Buteau would soon play a significant role in establishing the Angels as a major criminal force in Quebec. Life The Popeyes Motorcycle Club began working as \\"muscle\\" for the Dubois Brothers in the early 1970s, initially as assassins and later on as drug dealers. Buteau, a charismatic tall man with blonde hair and blue eyes, inspired much affection and loyalty from his fellow Popeyes, who were seen as the most violent of Quebec's 350 outlaw biker clubs. In 1974, Buteau and the Popeyes started to fight an especially-brutal biker war with the Devil's Disciples biker gang, which was considered as the most powerful outlaw biker club in Montreal. By January 1976, 15 of the Devil's Disciples had been killed by the Popeyes, led them to disband. On August 14, 1976, at the age of 25, Buteau was among the many arrested at a hotel in Saint-Andr√©-Avellin after almost 50 Popeyes had entered and trashed the place. While president of the Popeyes, Buteau was personally courted by Sonny Barger, the leader of the Hells Angels and the most famous member, to persuade his fellow Popeye members to join the Angels. Initially, the Hells Angels had planned to \\"patch over\\" the Devil's Disciples, but as the Popeyes had eliminated them, Barger switched over to courting Buteau. The Popeyes, Montreal's strongest outlaw biker club, become Canada's first Hells Angels chapter on December 5, 1977. At the time, the Popeyes were quarreling with the Satan's Choice club, which had expanded into Quebec from Ontario after it had moved into Canada from the United States earlier. Barger, a legend with the Hells Angels, awarded Buteau his colours and respected him so much that he was the only Canadian authorized to use the title of \\"Hells Angels International.\\" Barger praised Buteau and the Popeyes as the most \\"hardcore\\" outlaw bikers in Canada, thereby making them the ones most worthy of becoming Hells Angels. Shortly afterwards, in January 1978, the Montreal chapter of the Satan's Choice biker gang \\"patched over\\" to become Outlaws, thereby importing the traditional rivalry between the Outlaws and Hells Angels into Canada. Buteau changed the chapter from a group of beer drinking brawlers to an organized criminal empire. Throughout his time as president of the Hells Angels, Buteau was in contact with other outlaw biker gangs and aimied to persuade them to join the Hells Angels. He aspired to have his members to appear clean-shaven, keep lower profiles, and avoid hassles. In 1978, a biker war broke out between the Montreal chapters of the Hells Angels and the Outlaws. The immediate cause of the biker war was the shooting of two Outlaws outside a Montreal bar popular with the Angels by Angels' ace assassin Yves \\"Apache\\" Trudeau on 17 February 1978, causing one death, but the more proximate cause was the desire of the Angels to expand into Ontario. By 1980, it was estimated that Angels-Outlaw biker war had caused about 20 murders in Quebec and Ontario, while between 1981 and 1984 another 42 were killed. As part of his efforts to expand into Ontario, Buteau recruited one Wolodumir \\"Walter the Nurget\\" Stadnick, who had been the leader of a biker gang in Hamilton called the Wild Ones who arrived in Montreal seeking to \\"patch over\\" to form the first Hells Angel chapter in Ontario. The Outlaws saw possibility of a Hells Angel chapter being established in Ontario as a threat. Both Buteau and Stadnick were lucky to survive Le Tourbillon massacre on 12 October 1978, when at Le Tourbillion bar in Montreal, the Outlaws killed 1 Hells Angel and badly injured another 2 while killing 2 of the Wild Ones. Stadnick was the only Wild One to survive the Le Tourbillion massacre. Upon learning that it was the Outlaw leader Roland \\"Roxy\\" Dutemple who organized and led the Le Tourbillion massacre, Buteau dispatched his \\"wild man\\" killer Trudeau after him and said that Trudeau's number one job was to kill Dutemple. After killing a man, named William Weichold, who just happened to look like Dutemple on 8 December 1978, Trudeau finally killed Dutemple with a car bomb on 29 March 1979. Upon returning to Hamilton, Stadnick had been forced to disband the Wild Ones after 5 of its members had been killed by the Outlaws and had fled to Montreal as a \\"refugee,\\" as Hamilton was too dangerous. Stadnick joined the Hells Angels in 1982 and became the their national president in 1988. In 1981, Buteau visited British Columbia, where he contacted a gang with three chapters in the Lower Mainland called Satan's Angels, and he persuaded them to \\"patch over\\" to become the first Canadian Hells Angels chapters outside Quebec in 1983. In the spring of 1982, at a meeting of Quebec Hells Angels, he demanded that group members quit the use of cocaine, but the ban was widely flouted, especially by the North chapter, based in Laval. Buetau stated that gang members with cocaine problems were not reliable, as they were too prone to using the cocaine they were supposed to be selling, and he announced that the penalty for breaking his new rule was death. On September 8, 1983, Buteau was shot and killed while he was the Canadian Hells Angels Canadian president. The shooter was a 22-year-old drug dealer, Gino Goudreau. Also shot and killed was Guy \\"Frenchie\\" Gilbert, the president of the Kitchener chapter of the Satan's Choice gang, who had traveled to Montreal to discuss \\"patching over\\" to become the first Hells Angels chapter in Ontario. Goudreau was a \\"prospect\\" with the rival Outlaws outlaw biker club who believed he would be a \\"full patch\\" Outlaw if he killed the Canadian national president. Goudreau's brother was a member of the Quebec Outlaws. After the shooting, Goudreau went into hiding but was arrested a few months later. He was charged with two counts of second degree murder but was acquitted after he had claimed self-defense because of earlier events. He claimed that Buteau had threatened him on many occasions and that they had both pulled guns, but Goudreau beat Buteau to the draw. A day after Buteau's funeral, a young boy discovered a bomb on the route in which the funeral procession, consisting of Hells Angels bikers had gone past. Police theorized that it had been placed and camouflaged the night before the funeral. Buteau was replaced by Michel \\"Sky\\" Langlois as the Hells Angels national president, who fled Canada to Morocco in 1988 to escape charges of first-degree murder relating to the 1985 Lennoxville massacre .

The commission was set up to examine allegations of human rights violations and inquire about enforced disappearances during the Panchayat system from 1961 to 1990. A report was officially submitted to the government in 1991, but it was made public only in 1994. The commission identified 35 persons disappeared on about one hundred studied cases. However, no alleged perpetrators were judged.  Background = The Panchayat System (1960-1990) = In early 1960s, Nepal's King Mahendra abolished the country's limited democratic government. In December 1960, he dissolved the Nepali Congress government, jailing all the cabinet members and a large number of workers for all parties. He proceeded to ban political parties and set up a system of ‚Äúpartyless‚Äù autocratic rule. The growing popularity of the Prime Minister, Mr. B.P. Koilara, and the radical socialist line adopted by the Nepali Congress, which was detrimental to the interest of the feudal landlords and aristocratic families, were two main factors which led King Mahendra to extend his powers. Since the king is accepted as a ‚Äúbenevolent reincarnation‚Äù in Nepal, faith in the monarchy is high. The palace had the unique control of the army, which allowed this royal takeover. The new constitution of 1962 established a non-party system under which the king exercised sole power[3]: the Panchayat system. The elected Prime Minister, members of Parliament and political opponents were arrested by the military. The constitution adopted many features of the Rana system and the Panchayat system was an institution of great antiquity. Historically and in accordance with Hindu religion, each caste group system of Nepal formed its own panchayat (council of elders): it was a sociopolitical organization based on a village level. King Mahendra wanted its incorporation at the national level, as an exponent of Nepalese culture. According to the king, ‚Äúthere are two institutions in Nepal, namely kingship and panchayat that are commonly known and understood by the people and that work for unity and stability and peaceful progress, and it is through these institutions that the edifice of Nepal‚Äôs progress has to be built‚Äù. The Panchayat system was a pyramidal structure running from village assemblies up to the National Parliament (Rastriya Panchayat). Even when Mahendra's son, King Birenda, a Western liberal educated man, took power in 1971, all forms of political activities were prohibited and repression of political opposition groups continued. = Protests from the 1980s = The autocratic system remained in place until 1990 but the beginning of a civil disobedience campaign by the Nepali Congress Party for restoration of multi-party system started from the 1980s. The Communist Party, the other main political party, adopted both a policy of infiltration into the panchayat system and a policy of continuous struggle. Public dissent against authoritarian rule, student demonstration and anti- regime activities grew along with rampant arrests of activists by the royal government. Students and youth, i.e. the intellectuals, were a strong base of protest against the government. Under public pressure, King Birendra called for a national referendum in 1980 on the question of the system of government: retention of the existing panchayat system with suitable reforms, or the setting up of a multi-party system of government. The Panchayat system won a narrow victory. Some democratic reforms were carried out and a third amendment was added to the constitution. In May 1885, the banned Nepali Congress submitted a petition to the king signed by over three hundred thousand people, listing various local demands. After receiving no response from the king, the party decided to launch a civil disobedience movement which led to the arrest of thousands of political workers and their leaders. A repressive policy was set up by the government as response to the popular movement, and especially to a series of bomb blasts in June 1985. In August 1985, the government passed the Destructive Crimes (Special Control and Punishment Act). In 1990, popular pro-democracy protests suppressed by security forces resulting in deaths and mass arrests. This pressure forced the King to restore a multiparty system with parliamentary democracy.  The Commission = Establishment = After the end of the Panchayat system, when the Nepalese king ruled without parliament, the new provisional government established a truth commission: the first post Panchayat Prime Minister, Krishna Prasad Bhattharai, issued an executive order to establish the Commission of Inquiry to Locate the Persons Disappeared during the Panchayat Period in 1990. The truth commission emerged as a result of protests against absolutism, in the transition to constitutional monarchy in 1990. Due to controversy about the process of appointment of its members, the commission was dissolved almost immediately. The credibility of the commission was questioned because of the possible link between the chair of the commission and the prior regime: the appointment procedure referenced the abolished 1962 Panchayat Constitution rather than the new legal system. The government then appointed a second commission with the same mandate, but through an acceptable process that considered the end of the Panchayat system and the political changes of the country. = Mandate, goals, commissioners = The Commission was created to examine allegations of human rights violations during the Panchayat system from 1961 to 1990, to investigate and identify the final places of detention of the disappeared and to identify additional victims. The enquiry was led by four commissioners: Surya Bahadur Shakya as chair, Prakash Kafle, Basudev Dhungana and Dr. Sachche Kumar Pahadi. = Report and findings = A two-volume report was officially submitted to the government in 1991, but it was made public only in 1994 thanks to the pressure from civil society groups, including Amnesty International. Today, the report is only available through the parliamentary secretariat and Nepal's national library. The commission investigated about one hundred cases and identified a total of 35 persons \\"disappeared\\" at the hands of the state, five of whom were killed, and the rest declared ‚Äúunknown‚Äù. The commission also acknowledged that there had been gross infringements of human rights, but it had no powers to name perpetrators or subpoena officials. The police were generally unresponsive to the commission's requests for information. Despite local human rights groups urging the government to ensure that any persons implicated in human rights violations be brought to justice, no alleged perpetrators faced trial.  Civil War (1996-2006)  Despite the work of the commission, mass disappearances continued in Nepal, particularly during the ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù from 1996 to 2006, opposing the government to the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). The United Nations listed Nepal as the country with the most disappearances in 2003-2004. In February 1996, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN-M) declared a ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs war‚Äù against the ‚Äúruling classes‚Äù which included the monarchy and the political parties. It gave a forty-point ultimatum to the government, asking particularly for a popular democracy. From that moment and during the next six years, the battle between government troops and Maoist guerrillas left thousands dead, paralyzed the economy and maintained a state of terror. Initially, the CPN attacked police stations and then gradually as its influence extended, created militias. Meanwhile, the government settled for individual elimination of local communist cadres and other \\"enemies of the people\\" until 2000. It was only in 2001 that the two groups started a discussion, after the massacre of the royal family: the king and several other family members were killed, further to a family dispute. The circumstances of death are not clear but Prince Dipendra killed his father and the others before committing suicide. The rebels had three main demands: the abolition of the monarchy, the formation of a coalition government and the election of a constituent assembly. The government refused, and conflict resumed. This time the attacks affected the garrisons of the royal army, which then entered into the conflict ‚Äì it had not taken part to date. A state of emergency was declared after more than 100 people were killed in rebel and government operations in 2001. From 1996 to 2006, the number of the dead is estimated at more than 13,000 and approximately 1,300 people were forcibly disappeared. The Nepalese Maoist insurgency came to an end when the Maoist guerrillas leadership and the Seven- Party-Aliiance (SPA) signed a 12-point-understanding in New Delhi in November 2005. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2006 in Kathmandu gave an official start to a ‚Äúpeace process‚Äù.  New Commission (2014)  Since the 2006 signing of the peace agreement, the number of disappearances has dramatically decreased. One of the conditions agreed between the government and the Maoists was to create a new commission to inquire about the enforced disappearances. In 2008, the monarchy was abolished and a federal democratic republic was established. Many victims‚Äô groups have continued to call for a thorough and independent investigation into the disappearances of the conflict, and a commission was formed through the Commission on Investigation into Disappeared Persons, Truth and Reconciliation Act 2014 (CoID-TR Act). The CoID-TR Act established two separate commissions: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and a Commission of Inquiry on the Disappearances (CoID).A.Bisset, Transitional Justice in Nepal: The Commission on Investigation of Disappeared Persons, Truth and Reconciliation Act 2014 (Bingham Centre Working Paper 2014/07), Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, BIICL, London, September 2014, 3. http://binghamcentre.biicl.org/documents/334_nepal_update_-_bisset.pdf The two commissions were able to share their information and coordinate their operations. One of the main debate around the new commission was the recommendation of amnesties for crimes under international law within the Act itself. Many victims‚Äô groups were against this part of the Act. That is why five experts for the UN Human Rights Council examined the TRC Act passed by Nepal's Constituent Assembly. According to Richard Bennett, Asia director at Amnesty International, ‚Äúthe UN‚Äôs findings are consistent with what human rights groups have been saying all along ‚Äì Nepal‚Äôs TRC Act is fundamentally flawed and could leave thousands of victims of conflict-related violations without access to the justice they deserve‚Äù. Under international pressure, the Supreme Court annulled the amnesty provision saying it was against constitutional provisions and international laws. The humanitarian crisis due to the 2015 earthquakes created new problems for the people and slowed progress towards achieving justice.  Challenge of Justice  None of the post-1990 governments have tried to bring the violators of human rights to justice, despite the several commissions in Nepal formed to investigate major human rights violations and political violence. Also in 1990, the government created a separate commission to investigate the loss of life and damage to property during the popular movement in 1990. The Malik Commission submitted its recommendations to the government in 1990 and held various police personnel, local administrators and members of the Council of Ministers for the human-rights violations committed:The International Center for Transitional Justice.

Kathmandy: The Asia Foundation, September 1999. https://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/nepalimpunity.pdf The report was never made public and none of the alleged perpetrators of human rights have been tried for their actions or punished. A fear of criminal accountability persists and the new commission is to focus on the victims of violations committed by state agents rather than avoiding criminal prosecution in emphasizing that they were only victims of conflict. Since the early 1990s, after the transition to democracy, human rights groups have made attempts to combat impunity in Nepal. Instead of being punished, human rights violators have been taken to respectable positions within society. Impunity and the lack of fear of punishment increase the possibility of further violations. The Nepalese society is still ruled by class and caste orders, and influenced by the feudal and monarchic state which existed until the 1990s. Power relationships in justice administration still remain in democratic Nepal: there is an independent judiciary but most of the judges are appointed by bureaucrats in the judicial service itself. Not only do inaction and corruption in politics persist, but Nepalese laws for prosecuting human rights violators are also lacking or inadequate, even if justice and laws are changing since the 1990s.

Alleyway in Moggessa di L√†. Dilapidated house. Moggessa di L√† is an abandoned and partly dilapidated northern Italian peasant village with no access road in the Carnic Alps west of Moggio Udinese in the Province of Udine. The second part of the hamlet, Moggessa di Qua, and the neighboring village Stavoli also have no road access. Moggessa Di L√† can be reached by a two-hour walk starting from Moggio Udinese, which is located on the A23 motorway. The name is in Friulian , in German (meaning \\"Little Moos beyond\\"), referring to a medieval foundation of the monastery in Moggio. Despite the altitude of 530 meters above sea level the area is suited for growing vegetables. The microclimate at the foot of Monte Palevierte (at 1,785 metres above the Adriatic / 5,856 ft) is very mild. Since there are no access roads, the village is accessible only by mule tracks. A path leads from Moggio Udinese to Moggessa di Qua that crosses the gorge of Molin brook after about two hours from the village. In the gorge are the last remnants of the mill to see, which was in operation until 1962 and was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake in 1976. The trail between the settlements is unlike after Moggio down, less steep and in better condition, so that you can communicate between the two villages via dirt bike. From the other side Moggessa di L√† is after an hour walking time via a steep narrow road and a river crossing (there is no bridge) of Stavoli from accessing. Stavoli is another mountain village with no access road. At the entrance of Moggessa di L√† is a small Catholic church. A cemetery does not exist however. Particularly appealing are the narrow allyways, where the farmhouses are concentrated in a small space. The relatively high built houses and partly ruined buildings are very close together. In between, often extend only a few meters wide streets. The clear overgrown fields lie below the village. Early 20th century the inhabitants lived largely autonomously as self-catering. In winding core take several cobbled streets together. Five houses were inhabited by 2008, but not all year. At the lower edge where the fields begin is the largest and most striking house, an old craftsman house. It has two superimposed arcades whose lower arches are open. Two other still preserved show brick arches of a ruined house near that this style element was used here more often. Until 1960 there was in this village here even a school. As in neighboring villages, there are also many examples of rural, reduced to essentials architecture, which is characteristic of this poor mountain area. The houses, all of them made of stone, are unexpectedly high, with up to four storeys. In the middle of the villages there are common wells. Many of the wooden balconies on the south side have already expired. Typical are also, outside of the houses, fireplaces (). The wreck of a cultivators shows that there is still motorized farm equipment were used, before people have moved away. The very solitary life in the mountains, especially in winter was a little lighter than water pipes and electricity came to the village. Due to the strong 1976 earthquake with the epicenter in Venzone many houses in the village were destroyed. They are gradually being overgrown by bushes. Emergency quarters in containers were not possible because of the missing street. Today some of the lapsed houses are being restored by the descendants of that time, moved away villagers and inhabited during the holidays.

Background Between 1975 and 1979, a fifth of Cambodia's (then called Democratic Kampuchea) population‚Äîtotaling one to two million people‚Äîwas killed by the Khmer Rouge. During the twenty years which followed, there was a general resistance to ‚Äúdigging up past horrors‚Äù. The country and new government chose not to participate in official truth-seeking during the transitional period and Cambodians in general showed little interest in speaking about that era. However, once the last of the regime had been overthrown in 1999, Cambodians began to show an increased interest in learning their past and uncovering the truth of the Khmer Rouge regime. It was decided that justice would be sought through retributive trials. In 2001, the Cambodian National Assembly passed a law on the establishment of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia for the Prosecution of Crimes Committed during the Period of Democratic Kampuchea. These hybrid tribunals enacted jointly by the Cambodian government and the United Nations were not expected to be a final solution, but they were a departure point. This move towards justice acknowledged both the surviving and lost Cambodian victims, and proved that the past would not forgotten, or diminished. Rather, the past was to be addressed ‚Äúslowly and unevenly‚Äù. Tribunals In 2001, the Cambodian National Assembly passed a law to create a court which would try the offenders of the most serious crimes during the regime. The court was named the ‚ÄúExtraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia‚Äù. The E.C.C.C's goals were to include justice, truth, and national reconciliation. However, in order to achieve these goals, the Cambodian population will need to understand not only their history, but what the trials themselves involve. The trials ‚Äúneed to mean something to these people‚Äù, especially to those living outside the capital. The E.C.C.C. report states that ‚Äúit is hoped that fair trials will ease the burden that weighs on the survivors‚Äù. It wants the trials to be viewed as important for those remembering the past, but also for those confronting the future, especially younger generations learning Cambodian history. This hybrid court run by both Cambodian and international judges had (and continues to have) lofty goals, and only began its proceedings nearly a decade after the 1997 UN offer of help and the official 1998 end to the Khmer Rouge. The population's increasing interest in justice for the Khmer Rouge permitted Cambodia to begin ‚Äúa long-delayed conversation about its traumatic past‚Äù. Role of International Community Despite resistance against the Khmer Rouge during the Cold War, most Western governments recognized the Khmer Rouge as part of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (which temporarily took Cambodia's United Nations seat) during the 1980s and early 1990s. Since the fall of the Khmer Rouge, it has been the international community (mostly ‚Äòleftist academics‚Äô) that has led attempts at justice for the ruling group and its members. In the 1970s, Australian Southeast-Asian historian Ben Kiernan had already begun the process of interviewing Cambodian survivors and publishing their accounts of the Khmer Rouge occupation. In the 1980s he translated these accounts and other official documents into English. Kiernan's advocacy continued in 1994 when United States Congress passed the ‚Äúgenocide justice act‚Äù and he was given a $500,000 grant by the US Department of State to continue to investigate the Cambodian Genocide. Though initially not supported by Cambodians, this project lead to the development of the Cambodian Genocide Program (CGP), and the 1995 creation of the Documentation Center of Cambodia in Phnom Penh. This documentation center has been called the ‚Äúmost impressive and organized effort‚Äù in the exploration of past Khmer Rouge atrocities. Now an independent research institute, the documentation center collects, catalogues, and stores documents from Democratic Kampuchea. For example, maps site of execution centers and mass graves and 50000-100000 pages of official Khmer documents found in a warehouse in Phnom Penh. This documentation center is publicly accessible and is now managed by trained Cambodian scholars and archivists. International actors were also responsible for setting the ‚ÄúExtraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia‚Äù in motion. In 1999, the United Nations experts published a report to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan regarding the Cambodian genocide, recommending an international tribunal to judge past Khmer Rouge crimes. At the same time, responding to the wishes of the Cambodian people, Prime Minister Hun Sen suggested a truth commission in conjunction with trials and considered inviting Desmond Tutu (of the South African truth commission) to Cambodia. Hun Sen's proposition was supported by the UN, but was considered too dangerous for the average Cambodian as many Khmer Rouge members were still dispersed throughout society. Finally, in 2003, the Cambodian government and the UN signed an official agreement to begin a special tribunal for senior members of Khmer Rouge. By 2006, the tribunal was operating and five suspects had been brought into custody. With the trials beginning within a year, there was a new focus on Cambodian history and the Khmer Rouge rule. Debates Surrounding Truth Processes= Resistance = Resistance to the investigation into Cambodia's past was led not only by the Cambodian government (and by many Cambodian citizens), but also by the international community. Processes of reconciliation in post-conflict countries such as Cambodia require the careful consideration of many levels of society. There is a complex relationship between poverty, corruption, and mistrust. Many were skeptical that the E.C.C.C and the Cambodian government could enact trials ‚Äúfair, transparent, and accessible to the public‚Äù. Scholar Jorg Menzel also expressed sentiments of skepticism asserting that ‚Äúa trial will not cure them at all‚Äù but instead ‚Äúmight be somewhat dangerous shock therapy as trials bring memories back and force people to reflect [on] their past‚Äù. During Ben Kiernan's work with the CGP, he faced both Western and Eastern resistance. Kiernan says the success of the CGP was achieved ‚Äúunder fire‚Äù and that he was ‚Äúthreatened by the West‚Äôs most powerful newspaper‚Äù (the Wall Street Journal). In an editorial for the Wall Street Journal, released on the 20th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge's seizure of power, Harvard's Stephen J. Morris denounced the CGP and called its director (Kiernan) a ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù and a Khmer Rouge sympathizer. He subsequently asked Congress to revoke the $500,000 grant given to Kiernan and the CGP. In his book, Kiernan discusses the resistance to his work, citing genocide denial in three main points. He says there is outright denial that a genocide occurred in Cambodia under Khmer rule, a defense rooted in a technicality of definition‚Äîwhether it was really a genocide or not, and lastly, the act of suppressing research programs and other initiatives investigating Khmer Rouge crimes. He says ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù is still disputed by several prominent Cambodian historians, both inside and outside of the country. = Searching for Justice = As justice efforts unfold, it is wondered whether judicial processes will help with Cambodia's reconciliation. Is a corrupt and weak government equipped to deliver justice? Many survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime also wonder whether the judicial processes at E.C.C.C are enough, or even the best way to encourage reconciliation in Cambodia. In a poll it was found that over 80% of Cambodians want justice for the Khmer leaders, however most said they simply want to know why and how the tragedies happened. They wanted an acknowledgement of responsibility. In tribunals such as the E.C.C.C, one cannot hold all responsible accountable. It is difficult to equate millions of Cambodians who suffered to the imprisonment of select few Khmer leaders. That said, these tribunals are a form of symbolic justice. To go hand-in-hand with these tribunals, it has been recommended that Cambodia focus on simultaneous restorative justice. The combination is seen as necessary for successful transitional justice. The possibility of a truth commission in Cambodia has been considered, and its strengths, weaknesses, and feasibility taken into account. A truth commission would allow all those who told the truth to forgot prosecution, and those who refused, to face it. This form of justice would provide a more complete version of truth, and would permit the quicker resurfacing of past tragedies. The E.C.C.C method is, unfortunately, slower and allows thousands to go without consequence. = Criticism = The Khmer Rouge Tribunals were said to be the most anticipated trials since the 1945-1946 Nuremberg trials. Finally, people would people be able to ask the Khmer Rouge: ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. However, the tribunals are problematic for several reasons: there is clear obstruction and corruption on behalf of the government, and most of all, because many low-level Khmer Rouge leaders are still in office today. The politics of country and the past of those in power inhibit justice. There are no ‚Äúclean hands‚Äù in Cambodia (or in the international community for that matter- all great powers played some role in the war). The impunity received by Khmer Rouge members, and their continued involvement in government is problematic. Critics argue that it sends the wrong message to the Cambodian public and discredits the justice process. Reconciliation therefore is difficult for Cambodians. Many survivors are still trying to forget their past, while those who want answers are hassled by the state. The goal of international justice is to ‚Äòright wrongs of the past‚Äô. Yet, this is more difficult in a country where the past still lingers in the present day. As the tribunals unfold, it is evident that Khmer Rouge leaders believed their actions to be necessary and claim they were just ‚Äúfollowing orders‚Äù. During trial, there is no remorse in their words: they describe the Cambodian population as pests to be exterminated‚Äô and blame dead Khmer leader Pol Pot for their crimes. In 8 years, the E.C.C.C has produced only one verdict: that of Comrade Duch (really Kaing Guek Eav) who oversaw Tuol Sleng prison where 15,000+ Cambodians were tortured and executed. He was found guilty for crimes against humanity, and was sentenced to life in prison. Truth and Reconciliation In 1994, the UN speculated that it was unlikely that the Cambodian government would hold the Khmer Rouge accountable. Over the course of the 1990s, this proved to be right. It is possible that Cambodians remained silent because their fear of the topic and the Buddhist/Cambodian tendency to not ‚Äúconfront conflict‚Äù, but also because they simply wanted to forget the past. In 1998 Cambodia chose not to participate in official truth- seeking at time of nationwide transition. Since Cambodians wanted to ‚Äúget on with what [was] left of the rest of their lives‚Äù, the prime minister chose to ‚Äúdig a hole and bury the past‚Äù. Doung & Ear write that transitional justice requires a ‚Äúpolitical commitment from the succeeding regime‚Äù, as well as ‚Äútime and resources with consideration of local cultures and religion, victim participation and scale of atrocity‚Äù. Cambodia of the late 1990s was not in a place to adhere to these requirements. Present-day Cambodia continues to face ‚Äúpoverty and corruption‚Äù which fueled a ‚Äúsense of injustice and mistrust in the current government‚Äù, and in society. However, even though the prime minister chose to ‚Äúbury the past‚Äù, Cambodia still remained divided into two camps: the victims and the perpetrators. This division, as well as increasing activism around the subject, slowly increased the desire of Cambodians to learn their past and to know the truths behind the Khmer. The E.C.C.C tribunals were not expected to completely fulfill these wishes, but they would certainly assist victims seeking out justice. Cambodian scholars say reconciliation will begin only when ‚Äúwilling to offer forgiveness‚Äù is asserted at the ‚Äúnational and community level‚Äù. In order for Cambodia to proceed with any meaningful justice (whether restorative or retributive) it must also achieve what is called a ‚Äúhuman rights protective culture‚Äù. This is a culture where all social, economic, political, and cultural rights‚Äîas outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ‚Äì are upheld to the best of the state's ability. The state must not be responsible for the violation of its own citizens‚Äô rights. In order to achieve justice, the Cambodian government must also demonstrate its investment in the project. They must be seen fighting to hold the Khmer Rouge accountable. If not, violence will likely continue or worsen. Until then, a truth commission seems unlikely. Experts suggest a ‚Äúnational or community-based truth-telling mechanism‚Äù or a type of ‚Äútruth and healing process‚Äù (as part of a larger reparation program). Future of Process As years go by, Khmer Rouge leaders are aging, dying, or becoming unfit for trial. The slowness of the process is harmful to the desired outcome of justice. Even though it has been trying on the population, Cambodians want to know the truth, and they want the international community to know how important the truth is as well. In his investigation on genocides, Kiernan says ‚Äúgetting history right has proceeded hand in hand with the quest for justice‚Äù. Finally learning the truth and understanding history will hopefully dispel the effects of years of silencing. The truth needs to be known so the story can be told to younger generations. In 2000, half the Cambodian population was post-Khmer Rouge and either did not know or did not believe what had previously occurred in the country. As of 2010, the Khmer Rouge regime was still not being taught in Cambodian classrooms. Cambodians want accurate information to be taught in their schools; they do not want a skewed memory of their history. The country is thus working towards educational and therapeutic measures, sites and practices of remembrance (such as the National Day of Hatred to commemorate the crimes and the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime), as well as preliminary efforts of restorative justice. Contemporary Cambodia experiences relative peace (through the work of the international community and local actors). But, this peace is fading over time. Cambodia has become a ‚Äúshallow democracy‚Äù, where there is ‚Äúnegative peace\\". Despite its efforts, the country continues to face corruption and the numerous human rights violations. Cambodia has begun its truth and reconciliation process, however its past is far from resolved.

On the left, one can see that this building was directly connected with the Alc√°zar. The Casa del Tesoro or Treasure House was a building next to the former Royal Alc√°zar of Madrid. History During the 16th century, the former Alc√°zar of Madrid was extensively remodeled to convert the ancient Muslim fortress into a royal palace able to host the king and his court. The ancient medieval structure was not only renovated, but its various functions were taken up by new additions: to the south with the construction of the Royal Stables, to the north with the plaza del Picadero and the gardens of La Priora, and to the east with the construction of the Casas de Oficios (Houses of Official Duties), the new kitchens and the Casa del Tesoro (Treasure House). The latter were constructed from 1568 after purchasing from Don Bernardino de Mendoza what hereinafter was called Casa del Tesoro. The space between the Casa del Tesoro and the Alc√°zar was subsequently acquired to build new kitchen and office facilities. This new complex had a direct connection with the Alc√°zar via a passageway. With the founding of the Monasterio de la Encarnaci√≥n in 1611, the area underwent another major expansion, which included a new passageway linking the aforementioned monastery with Treasure House. With this new building, the Kings could directly access the Encarnaci√≥n from the palace. During the reign of Philip V, remodeling was undertaken to install the Royal Library within the Casa del Tesoro, this being the forerunner of the National Library. The whole complex was demolished by Joseph Bonaparte (Napoleon's brother) and today in its place is the Plaza de Oriente. Buried under the plaza were basements, parts of building facades and the pavement of the old street in front of Treasure House, on the south side. This disappeared with the construction of underground parking and the tunnel covering Calle Bail√©n.\\"Informaci√≥n sobre Casa del Tesoro\\", madridhistorico.com ReferencesExternal links *Archaeologists discovered buried facades of the Casa del Tesoro and an Islamic foundation, all this gave an idea of the extent of the building Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Madrid Category:Buildings and structures in Spain demolished during the Peninsular War Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 16th century Category:Philip II of Spain Category:Buildings and structures demolished in the 19th century ","title":"Casa del Tesoro (Madrid)"},{"id":"49082979","text":"Vedra is a municipality in Spain.

Observers score the presence or prominence of ‚Äúfacial action units\\" (FAU), e.g. Orbital Tightening, Nose Bulge, Ear Position and Whisker Change. These are scored by observing the animal directly in real-time, or post hoc from photographs or screen-grabs from videos. The facial expression of the animals is sometimes referred to as the pain face. The GS method of pain assessment is highly applicable to laboratory rodents as these are usually prey species which tend to inhibit the expression of pain to prevent appearing vulnerable to predators. For this reason, behavioural changes in these species are mainly observed with acute pain (hours) but are less pronounced in longer-lasting pain (days). For mice at least, the GS has been shown to be a highly accurate, repeatable and reliable means of assessing pain requiring only a short period of training for the observer. Across species, GS are proven to have high accuracy and reliability, and are considered useful for indicating both procedural and postoperative pain, and for assessing the efficacy of analgesics. The overall accuracy of GS is reported as 97% for mice, 84% for rabbits, 82% for rats and 73.3% for horses. History Facial expressions have long been considered as indicators of emotion in both human and non-human animals. The biologist, Charles Darwin, considered that non-human animals exhibit similar facial expressions to emotional states as do humans. The assessment of changes in human anatomy during facial expressions were successfully translated from humans to non-human primates, such as the chimpanzee (ChimpFACS ) and rhesus macaque (MaqFACS ), but were not originally applied to assess pain in these species. In 2010, a team of researchers successfully developed the first method to assess pain using changes in facial expression in any non-human animal species. Broadly speaking, GS quantify spontaneous pain according to objective and blinded scoring of facial expressions, as is done routinely for the measurement of pain in non-verbal humans. Observers score the presence and extent of \\"facial action units\\" (FAU), e.g. Orbital Tightening, Nose Bulge, Ear Position and Whisker Change. These are scored in real-time by observing the animal directly, or, post hoc from photographs or screen-grabs from videos. This method of pain assessment is highly applicable to prey animals which tend to inhibit the overt expression of pain to prevent appearing vulnerable to predators. For this reason, behavioural changes in these species are mainly observed with acute pain (hours) but are less pronounced in longer- lasting pain (days). GS offer advantages over other methods of pain assessment. For example, the analgesic morphine reduces pain but can affect other aspects of behaviour in pain-free animals, for example, excitement, increased activity or sedation, which can hamper traditional behavioural assessment of its action on pain. Morphine not only reduces the frequency of \\"pain faces\\" but has no effect on GS in baseline, pain-free mice. In mice The GS for mice usually consists of five FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Nose Bulge, Cheek Bulge, Ear position and Whisker Change. These are scored on a 0-2 scale where 0=the criterion is absent, 1=moderately present and 2=obviously present (for exemplar images, see here ). In mice, the GS offers a means of assessing post-operative pain that is as effective as manual behavioural-based scoring, without the limitations of such approaches. Facial grimacing by mice after undergoing laparotomy surgery indicates postoperative pain lasts for 36 to 48 h (and at relatively high levels for 8 to 12 h) with relative exacerbation during the early dark (active) photo-phase. Furthermore, the grimacing indicates that buprenorphine is fully efficacious at recommended doses against early postoperative pain, but carprofen and ketoprofen are efficacious only at doses much higher than currently recommended: acetaminophen is not efficacious. A study in 2014 examined postoperative pain in mice following surgical induction of myocardial infarction. The effectiveness of the GS at identifying pain was compared with a traditional welfare scoring system based on behavioural, clinical and procedure-specific criteria. It was reported that post hoc GS (but not real-time GS) indicated a significant proportion of the mice were in low-level pain at 24 h which were not identified as such by traditional assessment methods. Importantly, those mice identified as experiencing low-level pain responded to analgesic treatment, indicating the traditional methods of welfare assessment were insensitive in this aspect of pain recognition. Mice with induced sickle cell disease and their controls exhibited a \\"pain face\\" when tested on a cold plate, but sickle mice showed increased intensity compared to controls; this was confirmed using Von Frey filaments a traditional method of pain assessment. GS have also been used to assess pain and methods of its alleviation in pancreatitis. GS have also been used to test the degree of pain caused as a side-effect of therapeutic drugs and methods of mitigating the pain. The mouse GS has been shown to be a highly accurate, repeatable and reliable means of assessing pain, requiring only a short period of training for the observer. Assessment approaches that train deep neural networks to detect pain and no-pain images of mice may further speed up MGS scoring, with an accuracy of 94%. =Sex and strain effects= It has been noted that DBA/2 strain mice, but not CBA strain mice, show an increase in GS score following only isoflurane anaesthesia, which should be taken into account when using the GS to assess pain. Administration of a common analgesic, buprenorphine, had no effect on the GS of either strain. There are interactions between the sex and strain of mice in their GS and also the method that is used to collect the data (i.e. real-time or post hoc), which indicates scorers need to consider these factors. =Effects of non-painful procedures= It is important to establish whether methods of pain assessment in laboratory animals are influenced by other factors, especially those which are a normal part of routine procedures or husbandry. There is no difference in GS scores between mice handled using a tube compared with mice picked up by the tail, indicating these handling techniques are not confounding factors in GS assessment. A similar study reported there was no difference between GS scores at baseline and immediately post ear notching (a method frequently used to identify laboratory mice), potentially indicating that the pain associated with ear notching is either too acute to assess using the GS tool or the practice is not painful. In rats Closeup of the face of an agouti Russian blue rat There are differences between the \\"pain face\\" of mice and rats. In mice, the nose and cheek at baseline have a smooth appearance, but in the presence of pain, change to distinct bulges in both the nose and cheek regions. By contrast, in rats at baseline, the nose and cheek regions show distinct bulging, and with pain, the bridge of the nose flattens and elongates causing the whisker pads to flatten. As a consequence of these differences, the GS for rats sometimes use four FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Nose/Cheek Flattening, Ear Changes and Whisker Changes. Nose/Cheek Flattening, appears to show the highest correlation with the presence of pain in the rat. GS for rats has been used to assess pain due to surgery, orthodontic tooth movement, osteoarthritis, acute chemotherapy-induced mucositis, and the efficacy of analgesics for these procedures and other painful conditions. Furthermore, GS have been used to examine the effects of postoperative analgesia on the reduction of post-operative cognitive dysfunction in aged rats. As with mice, studies have examined the extent of agreement in assessing pain between rat GS and the use of von Frey filaments. Good agreement has been found between these in relation to three models of pain (intraplantar carrageenan, intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant and plantar incision). The GS score significantly increased in all pain models and the peak GS score also coincided with the development of paw hypersensitivity, although hypersensitivity persisted after GS scores returned to baseline. For rats, software (Rodent Face Finder¬Æ) has been developed which successfully automates the most labour-intensive step in the process of quantifying the GS, i.e. frame-grabbing individual face- containing frames from digital video, which is hindered by animals not looking directly at the camera or poor images due to motion blurring. In rabbits A GS for rabbits using four FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Cheek Flattening, Nose Shape, Whisker Position (Ear Position is excluded from the analysis) has been developed (for exemplar images, see here ) and used to assess the effectiveness of an analgesic cream for rabbits having undergone ear- tattooing. Similarly, a GS has been used to evaluate wellness in the post- procedural monitoring of rabbits. In horses Based on the identification of FAU in rodents and rabbits, a GS for horses has been developed from post- operative (castration) individuals. This is based on six FAU, i.e. Stiffly Backwards Ears, Orbital Tightening, Tension Above the Eye Area, Prominent Strained Chewing Muscles, Mouth Strained and Pronounced Chin, Strained Nostrils and Flattening of the Profile (for exemplar images, see here.) The HGS has thereafter been used to evaluate pain behavior in the laminitic horse, where it was concluded that the grimace scale can be used to assess the degree of pain also here, when compared to the Obel scale. A related study describes the equine ‚Äúpain face‚Äù after pain induction by a tourniquet on the antebrachium or topical capsaicin. The pain face here involves similar facial expressions described for the HGS; low and/or asymmetrical ears, an angled appearance of the eyes, a withdrawn and/or tense stare, medio-laterally dilated nostrils and tension of the lips, chin and certain mimetic muscles and can potentially be incorporated to improve existing pain evaluation tools. From the described pain face, The Equine Pain Scale has been developed. Another pain scale has been described (EQUUS-FAP) which also has proven to assess acute pain in horses in a significant way. To map and explain the different facial expressions seen in the equine face during acute pain, an equine facial action coding system (EquiFACS) has been developed. Seventeen FAU have been identified and the involved anatomical structures behind each facial expression are explained and compared to facial expressions seen in other species. In cats A preliminary study based on landmarks and distances between ears and in the muzzle demonstrated that observers shown facial images from painful and pain-free cats had difficulty in identifying pain-free from painful cats, with only 13% of observers being able to discriminate more than 80% of painful cats. Accuracy (based on a dichotomous judgement - pain or no pain) ranged from 18 to 94%. A complete GS (Feline Grimace Scale - FGS) was recently developed for cats to detect naturally- occurring acute pain. Five FAU were identified: ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whiskers change and head position. Each FAU receives a score from 0 to 2 and a total pain score is calculated as the sum of the FAU‚Äôs scores divided by the total possible score excluding those AU marked as ‚Äúnot possible to score‚Äù (i.e. 4/10 = 0.4 or 4/8 = 0.5). A training manual is available as ‚ÄúSupplementary information‚Äù within the original article. The FGS has been thoroughly validated and reported high discriminative ability, good overall inter-rater reliability, excellent intra- rater reliability, and excellent internal consistency. The FGS scores were higher in painful than in control cats; a very strong correlation with another validated instrument for pain assessment in cats was observed and the FGS detected response to analgesic treatment (scores after analgesia were lower than before). Additionally, an analgesic threshold was determined (total pain score _>_ 0.39 out of 1.0). The FGS is an easy and quick-to-use tool for acute pain assessment in cats. The clinical applicability of the FGS in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy has been explored by comparing the scores assigned in real-time by an experienced observer with those scores assigned to still images, and good agreement has been reported. The FGS is also a reliable tool for pain assessment in cats undergoing dental extractions and the caregiver's presence did not affect FGS scores. In sheep A GS for sheep has been developed to detect pain caused by naturally occurring diseases such as footrot and mastitis. A GS has been used to assess pain due to the routine husbandry procedure of tail-docking in lambs. There was high reliability between and within the observers, and high accuracy. Restraint of the lambs during the tail-docking caused changes in facial expression, which needs to be taken into account in use of the GS.  In ferrets  Facial musculature of ferrets and compared lateral photographs of ferret faces were studied before and after intraperitoneal telemetry probe implantation. The FAU orbital tightening, nose bulging, cheek bulging, ear changes and whisker retraction were identified as potential indicators of pain in ferrets. All AU-scores assigned to the photographs taken five hours after surgery were significantly higher compared to their time-matched baseline scores. Further analysis using weights that were obtained using a Linear Discriminant Analysis revealed that scoring orbital tightening alone was sufficient to make this distinction with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

It is a widely distributed shrub which is shaped like an inverted cone and has small, very sticky leaves and branches and lilac-coloured flowers. Description Eremophila exilifolia is an erect, flat-topped shrub with very sticky foliage usually growing to a height of between . The branches are thickly coated with resin making them sticky and shiny but often becoming black due to the growth of sooty mould. The leaves are also thickly covered with resin and are crowded, often overlapping each other near the ends of the branches. They are also pitted, the pits often appearing as dark spots. The leaves are linear to almost club-shaped, long and wide. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a sticky stalk long. There are 5 sticky green sepals which are mostly long but differ in shape from each other. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petals are a shade of lilac, either dark or very pale, rarely white and the inside of the tube is white with purple spots. The petal tube is mostly covered with glandular hairs but the inner side of the petal lobes is glabrous. The inside of the tube is filled with woolly hairs and the 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from April to October and is followed by fruits which are a broad oval shape, glabrous and long.E. exilifolia growing near Dairy CreekNewman Taxonomy and naming Eremophila exilifolia was first formally described in 1876 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (exilifolia) is derived from the Latin words exilis meaning ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and folium meaning \\"a leaf\\" referring to the small leaves of this species. Distribution and habitat This eremophila is common and widespread in central areas of Western Australia, often found growing on rocky hills in red stony soils but also on flat areas, mostly in the Eremaean botanical province. It usually grows in mulga woodland and is often the dominant shrub in these areas. Conservation status Eremophila exilifolia is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The pale flowers of this eremophila contrast with its glossy, dark green leaves. It occurs naturally in arid areas and would probably not survive in humid areas or those subject to frosts. It has been propagated by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and grows best in well- drained soil in a sunny location.

It was built in 1876 by the Queensland Department of Public Works. It is also known as St Anns Crossing and Old Bowen Downs Road. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008.  History  Old Bowen Downs Road was established in the early 1860s as a teamster route between Port Denison (Bowen) and Bowen Downs Station near Aramac in central western Queensland. The road was in regular use until at least the late 1890s as a communication and supply line between the interior and the coast. While remnants of the road remain visible between Strathmore Station and Mount Douglas, the stone causeway built in 1876 over the Suttor River at St Anns remains largely intact as an example of early civil engineering stonework in northern Queensland. The Kennedy district was first explored by Europeans in the mid-1840s when Ludwig Leichhardt ventured into the upper Burdekin Valley. The area was not opened for settlement until 1861 and by the end of that year pastoralists had taken up most of the runs in the region. These isolated western stations relied upon teamster routes for important communication and supply lines to the coastal centres of the Kennedy. One of these routes, which was established in the early 1860s and became known as the Bowen Downs Road, ran about from Bowen through Eton Vale, Strathmore, Heidelberg, Hidden Valley (now known as Old Hidden Valley), Scartwater, St Anns and Mount Douglas, then on to Bowen Downs through Bully Creek (in 2007 known as Bulliwallah). With a decentralized system of road administration, no local authority to facilitate road building and a constant lack of money, Queensland's early road networks were generally in poor condition. The Kennedy district was no exception. The region had been identified as a rich pastoral area and the government realised that the development and maintenance of roads in the district was essential to support the growing rural economy as settlement spread. In August 1863 Henry Taylor Plews, Engineer of Roads for the Northern Division, informed a Select Committee on the Main Roads of the Colony that with regards to most of the roads in the Northern District, \\"... a great many of them have not been surveyed, and are not yet marked out; and that there are continually new roads becoming necessary.\\" Anticipating a heavy traffic between Bowen (Port Denison) and the interior, he recommended that the existing track be surveyed and cleared, and the creek crossings made trafficable. The Select Committee concurred. Plews engaged extra staff to carry out works in the Kennedy district and in 1863 and 1864 the Queensland Legislative Assembly allocated funds for road development in the area. By 1865 Frederick Byerley had replaced Plews as Engineer of Roads for the Northern Division; his report for the period covering 1864 to March 1865 showed that the construction of a trafficable road from Bowen to the Suttor River had been given priority and had cost about ¬£925. Despite this injection of money into road development in the Bowen district, local residents remained dissatisfied. An 1865 memorandum to Arthur Macalister, Minister for Lands and Works, from the people of Bowen, argued that Bowen was excluded from trade with the pastoral runs of the interior, owing to the want of roads, and that government roads expenditure in the Bowen area was disproportionate to that spent in other parts of the Kennedy pastoral district. The petitioners suggest that the Bowen Downs Road should be maintained as far as Earls and from that point a new line through Conway running the course of the Rosetta Creek should be constructed. By 1868 the suggestion of a new line to Bowen Downs had been taken up and a map of the Kennedy district, published in 1868 by the government's Chief Engraver, Thomas Ham, showed the new route, named Port Denison Road, tracing along the course of Rosetta Creek. Despite the construction of the Port Denison Road, traffic continued to use the old Bowen Downs Road and a fortnightly mail service covering some between Bowen Downs Station and Bowen, as indicated in Pugh's Almanac of 1875, was maintained. In September 1876 the Engineer of Roads in Bowen reported that use of the Bowen Downs Road had increased, in part due to the wool trade and in part to the discovery of gold in the interior, and that this increase in traffic had warranted considerable repairs along the line. A priority was the construction of a stone bridge over the Suttor River at St Anns, which had begun earlier in 1876. The Engineer of Roads outlined how many of the stones \\"have turned on edge\\" and \\"present a bumpy surface to wheels\\", and concluded that although the work was costly, all the stones having to be blasted, \\"the substantial completion of the Bridge is of urgent consequence for communication between the southern and northern goldfields.\\" The stone causeway at the Suttor River was an early civil engineering project undertaken by the Queensland Government in North Queensland. The earliest appears to have been the stone bridge and culvert on Damper creek on the Dalrymple Gap Track, which was built in the mid-1860s. From 1880, responsibility for surveying, constructing and maintaining roads passed from the Works Department to local Divisional Boards and the Department of Public Lands (as the latter still built roads on Crown Lands opened for selection) and the Queensland Government did not resume a major role in building main roads until the 1920s. In September 1896 the Survey Office issued instructions to Francis Blennerhassett to survey the Old Bowen Downs Road and mark out new camping reserves. Blennerhassett's plan, transmitted to the Surveyor General in August 1897, indicates that the road was still in use at the time and that portions were in good condition, including a \\"good smooth rock crossing\\" over Strathmore Creek near Strathmore. Remnants of the Old Bowen Downs road remain between Strathmore Station and Mount Douglas. A group of Bowen residents traced the road in 1964 and found several inns along the route as well as evidence of a stone crossing over Percy Douglas Creek near Mount Wyatt. Significantly, the stone bridge built over the Suttor River in 1876 was intact and was described in the 1960s as being: > \\"... flanked by a lagoon upstream, shaded by tall over-hanging ti-trees, and > with shady groves on the downstream side ... On the far bank ghost gums > completed a delightful scene ... The well-placed great black stones of the > roadway and the neat stone-pitching of the walls were undisturbed after > nearly a century of floods.\\" The Old Bowen Downs Road is no longer a state-controlled road and is no longer in general use. The stone causeway over the Suttor River is used mainly by local residents taking alternative routes between St Anns Station and Scartwater.  Description  Much of the nineteenth century work on The Old Bowen Downs Road has fallen into disrepair. Remnants of the stone causeway over Percy Douglas Creek are barely discernible, but the 1876 causeway over the Suttor River at St Anns remains substantially intact. The Suttor River Causeway, which is subject to flooding, is likely constructed of locally sourced stone. As the river is braided the causeway is in two sections, the southern section being longer and more intact than the northern. Flooding has dislodged some of the stonework, especially on the northern section. Two later concrete tyre tracks have been laid over the stone surface of the southern section, to accommodate motor vehicles. Timber posts remain on the downstream side of the crossing with an additional post on the upstream west side, possibly providing guidance during flooding. The causeway is flanked by indigenous Melaleuca sp. and Eucalyptus sp. and has an aesthetic value generated by the rustic materials and the bush setting.  Heritage listing  Suttor River Causeway on the Old Bowen Downs Road was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Old Bowen Downs Road was established in the early 1860s as a teamster route between Port Denison (Bowen) on the coast and Bowen Downs Station inland, and continued in use until at least the late 1890s. As a vital communication and supply line between Bowen and remote western runs, development and maintenance of the Old Bowen Downs Road was crucial to the growth of the region's economy during the nineteenth century. Remnants of the Old Bowen Downs Road are significant as evidence of the early establishment of vital road networks in rural Queensland during the second half of the nineteenth century. The 1876 stone causeway over the Suttor River remains particularly intact and is important in demonstrating engineering techniques and materials used in rural road construction in Queensland as settlement spread along the river valleys. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The 1876 stone causeway across the Suttor River remains substantially intact and provides rare surviving evidence of road construction techniques and materials employed in Queensland at this period. It is a rare, early civil engineering project in North Queensland, built by the Queensland government prior to Divisional Boards taking responsibility for road building in 1880. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The 1876 stone causeway across the Suttor River remains substantially intact and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. These characteristics include the use of stone for the construction and the submersible design. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Flanked by mature indigenous vegetation, the 1876 stone causeway across the Suttor River occupies a picturesque setting and is important for its aesthetic significance. It forms part of a landmark feature that is well known in the region and has been the subject of several publications including Pioneer Pub Crawl: Along the Old Bowen Downs Road and Bowen Downs and the Road to Bowen.

The event took place on May 8, 2016, at the Frontier Fieldhouse in Chicago Ridge, Illinois. The 2016 Global Wars was the third annual Global Wars event co-produced by ROH and NJPW, and the first to take place outside of Toronto, Canada. The show featured ten matches in total with two taking place on the pre-show before the PPV. All three of ROH's championships were defended during the event with one title change, where Bobby Fish defeated Tomohiro Ishii for the ROH World Television Championship. The main event match between Jay Lethal and Colt Cabana for the ROH World Championship ended without a winner when the Bullet Club group took over the ring with Adam Cole being introduced as its newest member. Production=Background= In February 2014, the American Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion announced a partnership with the Japanese New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotion, which led to the two co-producing the Global Wars and War of the Worlds events in Toronto and New York City, respectively, the following May. A year later, the partnership continued with War of the Worlds '15 and Global Wars '15, which were both two-day events, taking place in Philadelphia and Toronto, respectively. On August 21, 2015, representatives of NJPW and ROH declared that the relationship between the two promotions was stronger than ever, announcing another North American tour for May 2016, featuring new locations and wrestlers, as well as the first co-produced shows between the two promotions in Tokyo. The two-day event, entitled Honor Rising: Japan 2016, took place on February 19 and 20, 2016. On January 11, 2016, ROH officially announced that the 2016 Global Wars would take place in Chicago Ridge, Illinois on May 8 and would be broadcast live on pay-per-view (PPV). In addition to airing on traditional cable/satellite PPV, the event also aired on internet PPV through ROHWrestling.com and the FITE TV App. On April 14, the first four matches for the event were revealed. According to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the reveal of the full card had been delayed due to ROH hoping that Katsuyori Shibata and Kenny Omega would get their visas in time to work the event. On April 16, ROH announced the NJPW wrestlers taking part in the event; IWGP Heavyweight Champion Tetsuya Naito, ROH World Television Champion Tomohiro Ishii, IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Kushida, Gedo, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Jyushin Thunder Liger and Kazuchika Okada. On April 18, ROH added NJPW's IWGP Tag Team Champions Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa) to the event, while also officially announcing the main event of the show. =Storylines= Global Wars featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Jay Lethal, who defended the ROH World Championship in the main event of Global Wars Global Wars was main evented by Jay Lethal defending the ROH World Championship against Colt Cabana. The match was set up during the first night of Supercard of Honor X on April 1, where Cabana returned to ROH, confronting and challenging Lethal after he had successfully defended the ROH World Championship against Lio Rush. This marked Cabana's first appearance for ROH in five years. The following night, Lethal handpicked Cheeseburger as his next challenger, stating that he deserved a title shot more than Cabana. After defeating Cheeseburger, Lethal was again challenged by Cabana, who then proceeded to defeat Lethal in an impromptu non- title match. Cabana had lost a match for the ROH World Championship in 2009, which included a stipulation stating that he could never again challenge for the title in his hometown of Chicago. However, ROH stated that this stipulation had been overturned during negotiations between Cabana and the promotion, setting up the main event of Global Wars between Lethal and Cabana. On April 20, ROH announced the second title match for the event, which would see Tomohiro Ishii defend the ROH World Television Championship against Bobby Fish. Fish was previously scheduled to challenge his rival Roderick Strong for the title on February 26, 2016, at ROH's 14th Anniversary Show, however, a week before the match, Strong lost the title to Ishii in Tokyo at the ROH and NJPW co-produced Honor Rising: Japan 2016 event. This led to ROH adding Ishii to the match at the 14th Anniversary Show, turning it into a three-way, where Ishii retained his title by pinning Strong. Afterwards, Ishii went on to defend the title in NJPW, while in ROH Fish went on an undefeated streak in singles competition, which included wins over Christopher Daniels and a decisive win over Strong in a two out of three falls match, establishing himself as the number one contender to the ROH World Television Championship in the process. Also on April 20, ROH announced that at Global Wars War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe) would defend the ROH World Tag Team Championship against The Briscoes (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe). The Briscoes, who became the number one contenders to the title by winning a four- way match at Supercard of Honor X, looked to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship for the ninth time. On April 21, ROH added a tag team match, which would see Hiroshi Tanahashi and Michael Elgin take on Kazuchika Okada and Moose, to the event. Tanahashi and Elgin had been wrestling regularly as a tag team since NJPW's 2015 World Tag League and recently had become two thirds of the promotion's NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champions. Meanwhile, Okada and Moose's partnership was built at ROH's 14th Anniversary Show, where then IWGP Heavyweight Champion Okada defeated Moose in a non-title match. On April 26, ROH confirmed one of the previously reported matches for Global Wars, where the reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion Tetsuya Naito will take on Kyle O'Reilly. Naito's title is not on the line in the match. The two had previously faced off during the second night of the 2015 War of the Worlds event, where Naito defeated O'Reilly. Event Adam Cole, who joined Bullet Club in the show-closing angle, which polarized reviewers The main event match between Jay Lethal and Colt Cabana for the ROH World Championship ended in a no contest. Prior to the event, The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) had promised the \\"world's largest superkick party\\" and a new member to their Bullet Club stable, but went through their own match without performing any superkicks or revealing the new member. At the conclusion of the main event, the two entered the ring and gave both Cabana and Lethal Bullet Club shirts, before the lights in the arena went out. When they came back on, Adam Cole was in the ring wearing a Bullet Club shirt, while The Young Bucks superkicked both Cabana and Lethal. The show concluded with the Bullet Club quintet of Cole, The Young Bucks and the Guerrillas of Destiny taking over the ring, bringing the total number of superkicks to 51. Reception Several reviewers compared the show-closing angle to a New World Order takeover of a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) show. Jason Powell of Pro Wrestling Dot Net called it a \\"wannabe NWO finish\\" and \\"about as campy as it gets\\". He added \\"[t]he superkicks and the too sweeting may have put Bullet Club on the map, but it's time for the Young Bucks to start being as innovative with the gimmick as they are in the ring. There's no real sense of danger in watching a bunch of guys do a tongue in cheek emulation of what was cool in 1998[...]\\". He also criticized ROH for running the novelty of NJPW wrestlers into the ground by featuring them so frequently, calling ROH COO Joe Koff \\"downright giddy\\" about working with NJPW, while adding that it was \\"frightening\\" how oblivious Koff was to his booker Delirious' shortcomings. Overall, Powell called the show a \\"miss\\", stating that it \\"didn't have any dream matches on paper or in execution, which is something the past ROH/NJPW events were known for\\". James Caldwell of Pro Wrestling Torch described the angle with a simple \\"Eh\\". He later added that the event made it clear that ROH needed a \\"booking change\\", calling the current regime spearheaded by Delirious \\"burnt-out\\" and stating that the main event finish was not what ROH was built on. Caldwell went further into the booking by stating that ROH had moved to \\"lukewarm characters not really doing anything excessively heelish or exceedingly heroic getting reactions mainly for cool spots or big moments with very little follow-through\\", calling it \\"just not a sustainable approach\\". In making the statement, he pointed to the main event segment, noting that the Chicago crowd was conflicted in how to respond, despite Bullet Club costing their \\"hometown hero\\" Colt Cabana his first ROH World Championship. Meanwhile, Mike Metzger from the same site called Global Wars \\"an above-average show that was taken to another level with the angle during the main event\\" with him dubbing the show-closing angle \\"masterful work\\" and a \\"five-star segment\\". Nathan Kyght, also of Pro Wrestling Torch, called the show a \\"letdown\\", stating \\"[i]t wasn't a terrible show, but the ending left a bad taste with me and it just didn't have the memorable feel I was hoping for\\". Larry Csonka of 411Mania called the angle \\"bullshit\\" and gave the show a rating of \\"extremely horrendous\\", stating that ROH should be ashamed of themselves for producing it and asking $45 for it. Csonka also stated that the show made ROH performers look like \\"second class citizens\\" compared to NJPW performers, who came across as the real stars. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, who stated that Matt Jackson was one of the key people behind the design and layout of the finish, called it \\"polarizing\\", stating that history had shown that similar angles in WCW had been \\"great short-term but not so great long- term\\". Meltzer also called the angle a statement from NJPW to WWE, who had recently introduced The Club, which Meltzer called a blatant copy of Bullet Club. He also acknowledged the criticism of NJPW domination in the relationship with ROH, stating \\"[t]he reality is that New Japan's biggest stars like Kazuchika Okada, Tetsuya Naito and Hiroshi Tanahashi come across far more like major league stars than anyone on the ROH roster\\".

Notorious for its cruel and unsanitary living conditions, it was also known as the \\"Bastille\\" of Memphis.  Creation  The building that later became used as the Irving Block Prison was constructed in 1860 on Second Street in Memphis, as an office building. To protect the building from burglary, iron slats covered the windows. During the Civil War, it was converted into a Confederate Hospital by the Southern Mothers organization. After the capture of Memphis by the Union Army in 1862, it was turned into a prison to house soldiers and civilian Confederate sympathizers, including women and Memphis mayor John Park.  Extortion  In 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant appointed Stephen A. Hurlbut in charge of Memphis and the Irving Block prison. Hurlbut had been instructed to crack down on Confederate sympathizers and the smuggling of cotton, but instead set up an extortion ring to profit from the turmoil in the city. Hurlbut also began extorting money from Memphis merchants, imprisoning them in Irving Block on false charges of espionage and demanding exorbitant bond fees, then never calling the accused to return to court, keeping the bond or sometimes finding them guilty in absentia as an excuse to confiscate the rest of their property. Hurlbut appointed Captain George A. Williams prison commandant in 1863, and together they expanded the extortion ring to include the commanding officers at the Irving Block prison. Williams was emboldened by their success, demanding ransoms from wealthy residents who sought to release captive soldiers from confinement at the prison. John Hallum, a Memphis lawyer, wrote publicly about Hulbut and Williams' crimes and uncovered a scandal involving Hurlbut, making him a liability to Hurlbut's operation. Hallum was arrested and confined at Fort Pickering, where he nearly died from the deteriorating conditions. The notoriety surrounding Hallum's arrest brought about a War Department inspection of Irving Block in 1864.  Conditions  As the war intensified, the situation grew worse, and some prisoners remained in chains for months at a time, receiving little food or medical attention. Complaints about the conditions in the prison prompted an investigation by Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, who wrote President Abraham Lincoln in April 1864 that Lt. Col. John F. Marsh found the prison conditions to be unacceptable. The report detailed Marsh's first hand account of the prison, stating: > The prison which is used for the detention of citizens, prisoners of war on > their way to the North, and the United States soldiers awaiting trial and > which is located in a large block of stores is represented as the filthiest > place the inspector ever saw occupied by human beings. The whole management > and government of the prison could not be worse! Discipline and order are > unknown. Food sufficient but badly served. In a dark wet cellar I found > twenty-eight prisoners chained to a wet floor, where they had been > constantly confined, many of them for several months, one since November 16, > 1863, and are not for a moment released even to relieve the calls of nature. > With a single exception these men have had no trial. In April 1864, an officer reported to War Secretary Edwin Stanton of the shockingly inhuman conditions that the prisoners were kept in, leading to Stanton dismissing Captain Williams from his post. However, General Grant intervened on Williams' behalf, and Williams was reinstated as prison commandant. After Williams returned to the prison, and after the removal of Hurlbut from command, Williams dissolved the extortion ring and resolved to clean up the prison. In July 1864, the prison was officially designated a U.S. Military Prison.  Raid on Memphis  During the war, Confederate Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest became determined to free the prisoners from Irving Block, and led a raid on Memphis in August 1864 to accomplish this goal and free captured Confederate Generals. He didn't find the generals, although one did manage to escape during the night with 500 other prisoners, and he was successful in influencing Union forces to return to Memphis from northern Mississippi.  Closure  The prison was so notorious that it was eventually closed by order of President Lincoln himself in 1865. At that time the prison held about 1200 soldiers and 100 citizens. The building was condemned and demolished during the Great Depression in 1937.

Its origins can be traced to 1895, when the business founder Patrick J. Tierney began to build truck-based cars modeled after railroad dining cars. This eventually resulted in a business that manufactured prefabricated diners, which was incorporated in 1922 and ceased trading in 1933.  History  Patrick J. Tierney was the son of an Irish immigrant. In 1895, at the age of 29, he started a chain of lunch wagons. Reinvesting the profits, by 1905 he had 38 outlets operating 24 hours per day in strategic locations. These outlets had been built by Thomas H. Buckley but in 1905 he began constructing his own units in a garage behind his house at Cottage Place, New Rochelle, New York. The increased use of automobiles at this time meant that new zoning laws were restricting or even banning on-street food outlets, and thus forcing vendors to find fixed locations from which to sell. Simultaneously, lunch wagons were developing a reputation as disreputable due to the prevalence of cheap conversions of dilapidated horsecars, which were being sold off as New York's public transport transitioned to electric streetcars. The innovative Tierney, who coined the word diner, saw an opportunity: intending his static units to resemble railroad dining cars, he produced items of quality using, for example, electric lighting rather than kerosene lamps and replacing the outside toilets with interior ones. Initially selling his prefabricated diners for 1,000 each, and often offering flexible payment terms, Tierney died a millionaire in 1917. Tierney's sons, Edward J. and Edgar T. Tierney, then formed the partnership of Sons, which took over and carried on their father's business. The partnership became an incorporated company ‚Äì Sons, Inc. ‚Äì with the shareholders being the two brothers and their uncle, Daniel Tierney. The company claimed to manufacture one dining car each day and was, according to Andrew Hurley, \\"easily the most prolific of the prewar dining car manufacturers as well as a seedbed for other firms\\". Among the manufacturing businesses that were created by former employees were the Fodero Dining Car Company and the Kullman Dining Car Company. Unlike most of their competitors, the Tierney factory was some miles from a railroad and so the company created an in-house trucking department. Aside from manufacturing cars, for which they also offered operational training courses for new owners, the Tierney brothers also established the Tierney Operating Company in 1923. The purpose of this listed company was to open one new company-owned diner per week on average, over a period of four years. The brothers signed over all of their existing cars in New Jersey, New York and Westchester County to the company and offered half of its 500,000 shares to the public. Edgar Tierney ceased involvement and sold his share of the business to his brother in February 1926. In September that year the company ran into financial difficulties, causing Edward and Daniel Tierney to sell their controlling interest and then, in July 1927, their entire interest. Edgar, Edward and Daniel had formed Tierney Brothers, Inc. in February 1927 with the intention of competing against , Inc. This business, based at Mount Vernon, New York, solicited orders, allegedly by misrepresenting to be a continuation of the concern. It commenced production but delivered nothing because a restraining order was imposed that prevented them from using their name. In 1929, Edward J. Tierney was involved with the Roadateria company, a short-lived business that made a product described as a \\"combination dining car, lunch car and road stand\\". Just before he died in 1946, he tried again with a company called Tierney Diners, Inc. but that, too, produced nothing beyond the design phase. The dining car industry managed to continue expanding during the Great Depression but there was some significant restructuring. , Inc. ceased trading in 1933, although remnants of it passed into what is now DeRaffele Manufacturing.

The cattle are highly resistant to cold, though susceptible to heat, and are well adapted to the steep terrain of the massif.  History  Although the presence of a cattle breed in the Albera Massif was noted in the nineteenth century, the first description of the Albera dates from 1957. At that time three sub-types were distinguished within the breed: a dark-coated type; a variable paler type; and a third type deriving from cross- breeding with Braunvieh stock. More recently, the types are considered to be two: the Negra, or dark type, and the Fagina, or paler type. In 1999 the Fagina type was found to be genetically closer to the Bruna de los Pirineos breed than to the Albera Negra type. A breeders' association, the Associaci√≥ de Ramaders de la Vaca de l'Albera, was founded in 2008. The Albera breed received official recognition on 27 July 2011; a breed standard was approved, and a herd book established. At the end of 2014 the total population was recorded as 763, of which 618 were female and 145 male.  Use and management  The Albera is highly resistant to cold, though susceptible to heat, and is well adapted to the steep terrain of the Albera Massif. The cattle are kept year-round in semi-feral conditions, at an altitude between , foraging for food including the shoots and mast of the beech trees of the massif. They have little contact with man, and little productive capacity: cows calve every two years, and produce barely enough milk for the calf; meat yield is very low, of the order of .

Madrid The Convento de los Agustinos Recoletos or Convento de Copacabana, in the city of Madrid, was a convent located in the land now occupied by the National Library, the Museo Arqueol√≥gico Nacional, and several city blocks. This convent named the known Paseo de Recoletos of Madrid, name that refers to the Augustinian Recollect (Agustinos Recoletos), former owners of the convent and of the adjacent properties. In this convent the painter Francisco de Zurbar√°n was buried.  History  The convent was founded on 1592, on a land in Prado Viejo that was donated by the Princess of Asculi, Do√±a Francisca de Guzm√°n, to the Augustinian Recollect. This was the fourth convent that the Recollects had in Spain. At first, the Augustinians occupied the existing houses there. Later, at beginning of 17th century, they began the works of the new convent, which ended in 1620. Plaque in memory to the Convent at the National Library of Spain's door. In addition to the land donated by the founder, the monks bought surrounding orchards throughout the first half of the century, extending notably the length of the convent. The works were commissioned to Luis de Valladolid, although according to some authors, Friar Juan de Nuestra Se√±ora de la O and his son, Friar Lorenzo de San Nicol√°s, both brothers of the order, participated in its design. In 1837 during the Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendiz√°bal the monks were expelled and the convent disentailed. It was the Mendiz√°bal himself who bought it at auction. Shortly after was shot down.  Description = The monastery = The convent buildings, such as refectory, cells, nursing, etc. were arranged around two courtyards. At its around it stretched the spacious gardens. = The convent = The main facade was structured vertically into streets, for the five arches that served as access to the church. A triangular pediment with central oculus crowned the set. The church had the Spanish Baroque's characteristic plant: lounge floor, of a single nave with closed side chapels that formed spaces almost independent of the rest. Among them, it must highlight the Chapel of Our Lady of Copacabana, which housed the image of the Patron saint of Peru brought by Friar Miguel de Aguirre in November 1662. Unlike related buildings, it was not conceived with burial for nobles, but as a gathering place for the community. It grew to such importance that ended up giving name to the convent (Convento de Copacabana).

Arthur John Henry Taylor was born in New South Wales and received his general and architectural education in Brisbane. Hill and Taylor continued in Cairns until 1941, with a Townsville office running from 1933-39. The practice resumed in 1945 but was abandoned in 1952 mainly due to Taylor's ill-health. The partnership of Hill and Taylor dominated north Queensland architecture between World War I and World War II. The firm was responsible for a number of prominent buildings in north Queensland including the Cairns City Council Building (1938), the Cairns Post Office (1930), the Johnstone Shire Hall in Innisfail (1938), the Barron Valley Hotel in Atherton (1940) and a number of country hospitals, including Mossman Hospital. The Proserpine Hospital replaced an earlier timber hospital, which was built in 1911 on the old Bowen Road approximately from the centre of town. The first hospital was constructed using funds raised by the local community. They continued to fund the running of the hospital, assisted by regular donations from the local Proserpine Shire Council, until June 1930 when it was forced to close as it seemed that the Proserpine community were unable to support it any longer. However, a year later the hospital re-opened when the community rallied together to raise the necessary funds. Then in 1936 a decision was made by the Bowen Hospital Board, which had taken over the running of the hospital, to shift the hospital to its present site so that it would be closer to the town. A new hospital was designed in late 1936 to supplement the buildings shifted from the original site. A foundation stone was laid on 4 February 1939 by the Hon. Ned Hanlon. The new buildings, which were completed by 1940, consisted of a maternity ward, nursers quarters, male ward and an outpatients department. These buildings consisted of a series of pavilions joined by covered walkways. They were all in the same style and constructed in red brick with high pitched bungalow roofs, which incorporated louvered ventilators in their gables. A feature of all the buildings were arcades with distinctive brick arches and concrete columns, and projecting front parapets that gave emphasis to the entrances. In the early 1960s the front entrance parapets of the buildings were altered. This work varied slightly on each building but involved the removal of the ornate brickwork parapets and their replacement with plain triangular pediments or small hipped roofs. In addition the roofs which had been constructed in corrugated asbestos cement was replaced with galvanised iron. The hospital was redeveloped in the late 1990s. When works were completed in 1999 much of the original hospital had been retained including the former maternity ward, male ward, and outpatients department. However, the Nursers's Quarters which fronted Herbert Street was demolished. The original 1923 Maternity Hospital, later Wardsman's House, was renovated to provide accommodation to medical staff.  Description  The Proserpine Hospital is a group of three single storeyed brick pavilions located on a large block at the corner of Herbert and Taylor Streets, Proserpine. They are adjacent to new hospital buildings constructed in 1998-99. The new buildings all front Taylor Street. The three brick pavilions which all face Herbert Street, the original front entrance of the hospital, include: the former Maternity Ward the former Men's Ward the former Outpatients Department The former Maternity Ward was refurbished as part of the 1999 hospital redevelopment. The interior of the building has been altered and currently houses Allied Health (i.e. dental health/mental health/physiotheraphy/speech therapy and child health etc). The ward is linked to the former Men's Ward by a covered way. The walkway has been partitioned into small rooms, which are currently used for storage. The Men's Ward is also used for storage. The building comprises two wards and an operating theatre. The former Outpatients Department was inspected internally and found to be intact. The building, now vacant, had an area for administration, an examination room, a consulting room, a laboratory, an X-ray facility, and an outpatients treatment area. There were no changes made to the building as part of the 1999 hospital redevelopment. The building is currently closed to the public. Elements of the original landscaping around the buildings has been retained, including open grass areas and specimen trees of Moreton Bay Fig, Mango, Norfolk Island Pine, and Queen Palms.  Heritage listing  Proserpine Hospital was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 February 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Proserpine Hospital is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural place. The Proserpine Hospital is significant as a group of hospital buildings, designed in the tradition of separate pavilions which was part of a philosophy of hospital design. The Proserpine Hospital has a special association with the Proserpine community. The community was responsible for funding the construction and operation of an earlier timber hospital in the town. Today, the community continues to support its local hospital and, when the hospital was redeveloped in the late 1990s, the Proserpine community were adamant that the original buildings be retained on the site. The Proserpine Hospital has a special association with the work of the prominent architects Hill & Taylor, who worked in north Queensland in the period between World Wars and designed a number of country hospitals.

Florida, 577 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court, in an 8‚Äì1 ruling, applied the rule of Ring v. Arizona. to the Florida capital sentencing scheme, holding that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury to find the aggravating factors necessary for imposing the death penalty. In Florida, under a 2013 statute, the jury made recommendations but the judge decided the facts. Background Timothy Hurst was charged with killing Cynthia Harrison, a co-worker at Popeye's Chicken. The 1998 murder was part of a botched robbery at the Escambia County restaurant. Under Florida law, the maximum sentence a capital felon may receive on the basis of a conviction alone is life imprisonment. He may be sentenced to death only if an additional sentencing proceeding \\"results in findings by the court that such person shall be punished by death\\" (Fla. Stat. ¬ß775.082(1)). In that proceeding, the sentencing judge first conducts an evidentiary hearing before a jury (¬ß921.141(1)). Next, the jury, by majority vote, renders an \\"advisory sentence\\" (¬ß921.141(2)). The court must still independently find and weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances before entering a sentence of life or death (¬ß921.141(3)). This procedure was adopted from 2013 when Governor Rick Scott signed the Timely Justice Act (HB 7101) which overhauled the processes for capital punishment. A Florida jury convicted petitioner Hurst of first- degree murder. The jury recommended the death penalty, and the court sentenced Hurst to death, but he was granted a new sentencing hearing on appeal. At resentencing, the jury again recommended death, and the judge again found the facts necessary to sentence Hurst to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting Hurst's argument that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment in light of Ring v. Arizona 536 U. S. 584, in which case the Court found unconstitutional an Arizona capital sentencing policy permitting a judge, rather than the jury, to find the facts necessary to sentence a defendant to death. Opinion Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion of the Court. Florida's capital sentencing scheme, requiring that a judge instead of a jury to make the critical findings necessary to impose the death penalty, violated the Sixth Amendment in light of Ring v. Arizona. The Court also rejected Florida's counterarguments. Firstly, Florida argued that the jury's recommendation necessarily included an aggravating circumstance finding but still violated Ring because the jury's function was still advisory only. Secondly, Florida's reliance on Blakely v. Washington. is misplaced: Florida alleges that Hurst's counsel allegedly admitted the existence of a robbery, but Blakely applied Apprendi v. New Jersey. to facts admitted in a guilty plea, in which the defendant necessarily waived his right to a jury trial, but Florida had not explained how Hurst's alleged admissions accomplished a similar waiver. In any event, Hurst never admitted to either aggravating circumstance alleged. Thirdly, although the Court had repeatedly upheld Florida's capital sentencing scheme in the past (such as Hildwin v. Florida and Spaziano v. Florida.), it did not mean that stare decisis compelled the Court to do so again. Instead, time and subsequent cases had \\"washed away\\" the logic of Spaziano and Hildwin. Finally, the Court normally leaves it to state courts to consider whether an error is harmless. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a concurring opinion stating that he cannot join the majority's opinion because of the reasons he explained in his concurring opinion in Ring (since he did not fully agree with the majority opinion in Ring, he could not support the majority's rationale here in Hurst). However, he agreed with striking Florida's scheme, referring back to Justice John Paul Stevens' concurring opinion in Spaziano, among others, that he believes that any imposition of the death penalty by a single government official instead of a jury violates the Eighth Amendment. Justice Samuel Alito dissented. He disagreed with the majority on basically overruling Hildwin and Spaziano. Instead, he would have preferred for the Court to reconsider Ring directly. He also wrote that Arizona's sentencing scheme is much different than Florida's because under the former, a jury plays no role in the process. However, in Florida, \\"the jury plays a critically important role. Our decision in Ring did not decide whether this procedure violates the Sixth Amendment, and I would not extend Ring to cover the Florida system.\\" Aftermath At the time of the decision, Florida had about 400 inmates on death row, the most of any state except California. It was unclear how many might receive new re-sentencing hearings as a result of this decision. In late January 2016, about 40 inmates had appeals pending. The Florida legislature passed a new statute to comply with the judgement in March 2016, changing the sentencing method to require a 10-juror supermajority for a sentence of death with a life sentence as the alternative. This new sentencing scheme was struck down by the Florida Supreme Court in a 5‚Äì2 ruling in October 2016. The court held that a death sentence must be issued by a unanimous jury. The court ruled that the law \\"cannot be applied to pending prosecutions\\" which means that until the Florida legislature acts, there is no procedure or law allowing a prosecutor to seek the death penalty; it leaves open, however, as in the aftermath of the Hurst ruling, the status of sentences passed under the now twice-struck-down provisions. Nevertheless, the court granted Hurst a new sentencing hearing following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The US Supreme Court had received over 83 petitions from inmates on death row in Florida who believed that their cases had been decided incorrectly based on Hurst, in that the jury had unanimously recommended the death sentence while the judge had made the actual decision; these petitions followed after the Florida Supreme Court refused to re-hear these cases, on the basis that in all cases, there was beyond reasonable doubt that the juries would have decided on the death sentence. In November 2018, the US Supreme Court denied all these petitions, ruling broadly the Hurst decision only affects those whose sentences were applied post-2002, following the court's decision in Ring v. Arizona, were eligible for the Hurst clarification.  See also  * Ring v.

Building The building at 625 Park Avenue was designed by Park Avenue architect James Edwin Ruthven Carpenter, Jr. often referred to by the initialism \\"J.E.R. Carpenter\\". Carpenter has many designs on the avenue, (including 620 Park Avenue across Park Avenue,) and together with Rosario Candela is considered among its primary influencers. 625 Park Avenue was developed in 1929 by builder Louis Kauffman, who would later occupy an apartment in the building. The building is 13 stories tall and houses a total of 32 units. Triplex The penthouse at '625' is legendary, having even been nominated as Manhattan's best apartment. As a massive three floor penthouse, it has been home to large collections and decoration schemes. Helena Rubinstein decorated the unit with elevated absurdism.

Following an organization's social computing guidelines, social employees use social media tools both for internal workflow and collaboration purposes and for external engagement with customers, prospects and stakeholders through a combination of social media marketing, content marketing, social marketing, and social selling. Social employee programs are considered to be as much about culture and engagement as they are about business processes and best practices. In addition to increased leads and sales, social employee best practices are said to improve business outcomes important to social media marketing, such as increased connections and web traffic, improved brand identification and \\"chatter\\", and better customer advocacy.  Overview  The term \\"social employee\\" was first introduced to describe those exhibiting the emerging characteristics of workers operating under a social business model. The term is often used interchangeably with similar designations like \\"employee advocate\\" or \\"social employee advocate\\". Crucial to the perceived value of the social employee is the concept of the digital footprint. While organizations are able to generate large bases of followers through social media, research shows that brand marketing and engagement efforts through these networks are not as effective as those of individual employees. In fact, some research indicates that employee experts are more trusted than any other member of an organization. Because of this, social employee programs are designed to train, empower, and support employee engagement efforts in the hopes of authentically engaging larger communities, increasing the frequency of shares, reviews, and other forms of \\"earned media\\" and expanding the brand's presence on the web.  The personal or employee brand  A foundational concept of the social employee is the idea of the personal or employee brand. This concept first gained popular attention in a 1997 FastCompany article by business leader Tom Peters titled \\"The Brand Called You\\". In the article, Peters argued that the premium placed on branding impacted workers' lives to such an extent that creating and cultivating a distinct personal brand had become a professional necessity. According to Peters, doing so built trust, loyalty, visibility, influence, and employability. With increased adoption of social media tools by both businesses and consumers in the early 21st century, many business leaders became increasingly concerned with social engagement, both internally among employees and externally with customers and other stakeholders. While many in the business community acknowledged the potential social tools had for improved collaboration, productivity, and brand messaging, the concern that employees would misrepresent their brand, disclose proprietary information, or otherwise damage their company's reputation or ability to conduct business persisted. As a result, many began to advocate for employee branding as a solution to this problem. This helped give new meaning to the concept of brand ambassadorship, positioning everyday employees in public, and potentially high-profile, engagement roles.  Characteristics = Engaged = Because social employee advocacy is dependent on the perceived authenticity of the employee, engagement is highly valued in social organizations. Further, data show the measurable impact of employee engagement on organizational productivity and profitability: * Happy employees were found to be 12 percent more productive. * In one study, engaged employees were found to be 38 percent more likely to produce at above-average rates. In another, organizations with engaged employees had a 19 percent higher than average shareholder return, while organizations with disengaged employees experienced shareholder return that was 44 percent below average. * Engaged companies were found to outperform disengaged companies by up to 202 percent. * Companies with strong focus on culture were found to have an average 13.9 percent turnover rate, while those with a low focus experience were found to have a 48.4 percent turnover rate. = Flexible job environment and work/life balance = The number of professionals working mobile or remote has risen considerably since 2010. While estimates vary, one study found that number of organizations with mobile or remote employees is expected to rise from 24 percent in 2012 to 89 percent by 2020. Other research has estimated that by 2020, 105.4 million professionals will work remotely in America, about 72.3 percent of the total workforce. This change has been linked to a rise in social technologies, including biometrics, wearables, near-field communications, and augmented reality. Social employees have also put a greater emphasis on work-life balance, with many believing that advances in technology can directly support efforts in this area. Purported benefits of this shift include a more flexible workforce, reduced business costs, and greater organizational leverage in attracting and retaining top talent. = Buys into the brand's story = In 2009, thought leader Simon Sinek presented a speech called \\"How Great Leaders Inspire Action\\" at a TEDxPugetSound event. Sinek's central argument in this speech was, \\"People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it.\\" This concept‚Äîthat the story behind a business or product offering is a more compelling sales tool than the product itself‚Äîis frequently cited in social media marketing as a way to build authentic connections with stakeholders. However, others have argued that for employees to share a brand's story authentically, they must be engaged in that story themselves, and as a result, many companies have made storytelling part of their culture programs. = Collaborative = An implicit tenet in social business is that social technologies aren't a barrier to productivity, but rather a path to increased connectivity. The shift in enterprise software systems like IBM Connections to incorporate social communication models, such as mentions, wikis, and newsfeeds, reflects the changing communication dynamics within business. With an increase in diversity and sophistication in collaborative software platforms, social organizations have sought to find new creative ways to utilize these tools and secure employee buy-in around them. Crowdsourcing has also become popular in social businesses. Examples include AT&T;'s program The Innovation Pipeline (TIP), begun in 2009, which has generated over 28,000 ideas that have led to over 75 projects with funding exceeding $44 million. IBM has also put considerable resources into such processes, producing its social computing guidelines through employee crowdsourcing, as well as its Connections platform through the Technology Adoption Program (TAP), a more formalized crowdsourcing initiative. Another popular form of internal collaboration is the hack day, or hackathon. Organizations such as Netflix, Facebook, and IBM use hack days to pull employees out of their day-to-day work environments and encourage them to collaborate in nontraditional ways in an attempt to drive disruptive innovation. Social employees are often encouraged to seek external collaboration opportunities with customers and prospects. For example, Procter & Gamble introduced the Live Well Collaborative to connect with external stakeholders and develop products and services for the 50+ demographic. = Social listener = A social listener is someone who engages in social listening, or social media monitoring, for professional means. Social employees can use social media monitoring for a variety of reasons, including professional development, industry news and trends, and gauging market sentiment. Some have argued that social listening is one of the most important components of social business, as it enables organizations to collect rich market data, make more informed strategic decisions, and respond to customer needs more authentically. = Customer-centric = Advocates of customer-centricity in social business argue that social media has changed the dynamic from one-way brand messaging to shared interactions between brand and customer. Brand and customer engagement is seen as a means of creating more lasting connections with customers and prospects and empowering them to become brand promoters. Customer-centric interactions are seen to have distinct value to brands, as research shows that prospects are far more likely to trust brand-related messaging from a friend or family member than they are from a brand. As a means of building social employees, some social advocates have also called for a broader definition of customer to include the employees themselves. In the book The Pursuit of Social Business Excellence, authors Vala Afshar and Brad Martin made the following argument: > A social business operates with the guiding principle that each employee‚Äôs > responsibility is to serve one another, and that those we serve, even > internally, are our customers. To earn internal customer trust and loyalty, > each employee must be dependable, available, responsive, and committed to > the success of the whole. = Adaptable = The relatively quick proliferation and prioritization of social media in business has driven a need for organizations to be more flexible and responsive. This in turn has led to a reprioritization of employee skill sets in which adaptability, self-directed learning, and organizational sharing are highly valued.  Common features of social employee programs  According to Weber Shandwick, 47 percent of employees are either already prepared to advocate for their employers or willing to learn. Of those, 21 percent are what the study refers to as \\"ProActivists,\\" or early adopters, employees who actively use social media for professional purposes, with about half of this group already posting about their employer through social channels. = Pilot program = Many organizations begin with a social employee pilot program to determine best practices suitable to their organizational structure. Program design depends in part on the size of the organization and the desired scope of social adoption. For instance, whereas Domo implemented a mandatory pilot program requiring the participation of all its staff, Dell recruited approximately 200 employee participants through what was called the Social Media and Communities (SMaC) University.  Discovery  A common first step in a social employee pilot program is an initial process of discovery in which organizations attempt to identify and quantify their current resources. This can include a roll call of employee early adopters, an internal audit of informal adoption of social tools and practices, or a skills test to determine current adoption rates.  Social computing policy  Many organizations will recruit employees to actively participate in designing the pilot program. A fundamental concern of social media use in business has been its potential for abuse‚Äîspecifically regarding the release of confidential information, negative or off-brand messages, and security risks. Because of this, one focus in many social employee pilot programs has been to establish a set of social media guidelines. For example, IBM created an internal wiki and invited employees to help build a document laying out acceptable social engagement guidelines.  Training  To social organizations, social employee training helps to unify employee programs and tools throughout the organization and establishes a common knowledge base and set of best practices to assist employees in sharing and decision-making. Many organizations us a combination of in-person training, digital learning modules, and social learning principles. Social employee training often applies the 70/20/10 learning model as its basis. In this model, 70 percent of learning is self-directed, 20 percent is informal mentoring or coaching, and 10 percent is formal training. Applying this dynamic, many organizations work to design a \\"digital learning experience\\" in which employees can access learning modules and other subject-specific content to help them acquire new skills. Training is often divided into mandatory basic skills modules and optional advanced skills modules. To determine what social knowledge an employee needs, a baseline or \\"social IQ\\" test is often administered. Many organizations, such as Adobe with its Center of Excellence (CoE) and Dell with its SMaC University, have expanded their training programs to establish a more permanent resource for employees. Because social employee best practices affect organizational practice and culture in a broad way, upper management and executives are also encouraged to adopt social engagement best practices. Doing so is said to help drive buy-in among the workforce and reinforce organizational commitment to the program. Training for upper management and executives can often involve a process known as \\"reverse mentoring,\\" in which a lower-level employee is brought in to help develop a senior-level manager's skills and basic digital literacy. = Social engagement and content marketing = Social engagement and sharing through both internal and external channels are considered key components of social employee design. Employees are encouraged to communicate with coworkers, customers, prospects, and stakeholders through social channels by sharing industry-related news or user-generated content. Internally, this process is often centered on keeping employees updated on company and industry news, helping employees collaborate on projects, and building culture. Many enterprise-level social platforms have been developed to facilitate such objectives, including task management platforms, wikis, file-sharing tools, and messaging services. Externally, the focus is often on customer engagement, often through content marketing practices. Research has shown that social sharing can have a positive impact on metrics such as brand engagement, web traffic, and sales. The advent of digital commerce has led customers to research products more thoroughly before make a purchase decision, using social reviews, peer recommendations, and product-specific content to help guide their decisions. Because of the value of peer recommendations specifically, a primary of goal of content marketing is to encourage customers and prospects to share the content among their personal networks as a form of \\"earned\\" advocacy. Another popular social engagement strategy with stakeholders is resharing advocate-generated content through branded channels. This is believed to strengthen relationships with stakeholders and help to humanize the brand. = Assessment = Measuring the success social employee advocacy programs has presented a challenge to many organizations. While a small percentage of organizations assert that they are able to measure and validate their investment in social marketing, a larger percentage is either only qualitatively aware of the success of their social efforts or unable to measure whatsoever. Social business thought leaders argue that assessing the success of social employee programs must take into account more than financial return on investment (ROI). Companies that consider a broader set of metrics than financial return often measure success through a variety of key performance indicators: * Number of employee profile views and connections * Number of leads from social channels * Rate at which employee network grows * Frequency of shares and interactions * Increase in online \\"chatter\\" about a brand * Ability to attract and retain skilled talent * Increases in visibility, inbound web traffic, brand recognition, and brand loyalty Many organizations, however, do report financial benefits as well. Social employees are more likely to exceed their sales quota, and social businesses in general are more likely to see increased sales leads and increase in revenues. = Gamification, engagement, and culture-building programs = Culture-building programs vary in scope and complexity, but all use social media in some way to underscore employee, departmental, or organizational accomplishments. Program leaders will issue social engagement challenges to help employees meet goals. Challenges can include number of connections (i.e., likes or follows, retweets), number of leads, or frequency of posts (i.e., status updates, tweets, blogs, etc.). For a more competitive element, some organizations will employ gamification strategies such as leaderboards, achievement badges, and scavenger hunts.

The party was founded early in 1927 in preparation for the state election to be held later that year. It believed that the Nationalist Party had abandoned liberal principles. An urban-based party, it opposed the rural malapportionment that existed in the Victorian Legislative Assembly at the time. At the election, the party succeeded in electing two of its candidates, Frederick Forrest in Caulfield and Burnett Gray in St Kilda. They were both re-elected in 1929 after withstanding strong challenges from the Nationalists. Forrest died in 1930 and Gray lost his seat in 1932, and the party subsequently faded away.

The asteroid was discovered on 21 December 2008, by German astronomer Felix Hormuth from Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy at Calar Alto Observatory in Almer√≠a, southeastern Spain. It was named for British singer-songwriter David Bowie.  Orbit and classification  Davidbowie is a member of the Henan family (), a large family of L-type asteroids in the intermediate main-belt, named after 2085 Henan. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.5‚Äì3.0 AU once every 4 years and 7 months (1,665 days; semi-major axis of 2.75 AU). The asteroid has a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible condition code. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at the Steward Observatory (Kitt Peak) in September 2003, extending the asteroid's observation arc by almost 5 years prior to its official discovery observation at Calar Alto. Notably, the asteroid had a close encounter with the 200 kilometer-sized asteroid 16 Psyche, one of the most massive bodies in the main-belt, which it passed at only on 15 May 1935.  Physical characteristics  Based on its absolute magnitude of 17.1, Davidbowies diameter can be estimated to measure approximately 1.4 kilometers, using an albedo of 0.13, derived from the family's parent body, 2085 Henan. As of 2017, Davidbowies effective size and shape, as well as its poles, albedo and rotation period remain unknown.  Naming  In 2015, this minor planet was named after British singer, songwriter, producer and actor, David Bowie (1947‚Äì2016), just 3 days before Bowie's 68th birthday. Considered to be one of the most influential artists, Bowie released more than 25 albums including The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. He was also an actor in movies such as Labyrinth and The Prestige. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 5 January 2015 (),  References  External links  * Minor Planet Center MPC Archive, * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR ‚Äì Observatoire de Gen√®ve, Raoul Behrend * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (340001)-(345000) ‚Äì Minor Planet Center * * 342843 Category:Discoveries by Felix Hormuth Category:Minor planets named for people Category:Named minor planets 20081221 ","title":"342843 Davidbowie"},{"id":"49084008","text":"Hallamaa is both a Finnish-language and Estonian-language surname.

It takes the form of a series of precinct caucuses, meetings of registered electors within a precinct who are members of a particular major political party.Colorado Secretary of State website, accessed 18 January 2016 The purpose of precinct caucuses is to elect precinct committee persons and delegates to county assemblies, including those that elect delegates to the presidential nominating conventions. History The caucus system was adopted by the Colorado legislature in a special session called by Governor John F. Shafroth in August 1910 as part of a package of progressive reforms. It was seen as a way to limit the power of party bosses and to attract more grassroots involvement. The caucus system was abolished in favor of presidential primaries in 1992, but restored in 2002 with the defeat of Amendment 292002 Amendment 29 and cost considerations, the fully restored Colorado Caucus was in 2004.

The Colorado Secretary of State is charged with the responsibility of providing information about the system. Caucuses are regulated by Colorado law, but expenses for it are paid by the major political parties that use the system. At this time only the Republican Party and the Democratic Party have enough registered voters to use the caucus-assembly system. 2016 caucuses On March 1, 2016 (Super Tuesday), each of the two major parties (determined by number of votes in previous election) held a caucus in each precinct. Members of both the Democratic and Republican parties chose delegates to represent their precincts at the county conventions. Additionally, Democratic party members participated in a presidential preference poll which determined the allocation of delegates based on their stated intent to vote for a given presidential candidate. Regardless of party, delegates are bound neither to their stated intent nor to the preference given by the population they were chosen by. On the weekend before March 1 caucuses both major political parties had state chairs who unilaterally announced they wanted to see an end to the Colorado Caucus, the system that had been entrusted to their care. Partly as a result of poor leadership, the Colorado Caucus this year was chaotic.http://kdvr.com/2016/03/02/one-day-after-caucus-chaos-democrat-and- republican-leaders-want-primaries-in-colorado/ Propositions 107 and 108 Widespread support for 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders created chaos in the 2016 Colorado presidential primary caucuses, which were unprepared for the influx of first time participants.

The defunct Convento de Santo Tom√°s (also called Colegio de Atocha) was a set of buildings belonging to the Dominicans, under the patronage of St. Thomas Aquinas, in Madrid. It was located in the former Arrabal de Santa Cruz, showing its main facade to the Calle de Atocha.Carmen Rubio Pardos, (1977), La calle de Atocha, Annals of the Institute of Madrilenian Studies, Vol. IX Its exact location is close to the current Plaza de Santa Cruz, occupying part of the site of the current Church of la Santa Cruz. It was erected in the mid-17th century, being a good example of Spanish Baroque architecture. The convent had annex a cabinet for the teaching of theology, philosophy and rhetoric (College of Santo Tom√°s), initially dependent of the Dominicans of Bas√≠lica de Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha. The set consisted of a monastery that served as school functions, a courtyard and a large church. In 1836 during the Spanish confiscation church and convent were secularized and confiscated, going to have many uses, from administrative center to Milicia Nacional headquarters. Three years after suffering a strong fire the complex entirely disappeared, which occurred in 1872.Rinc√≥n Garc√≠a, Wifredo, (1993), Approach to the convent Madrid de los Austrias , Real Sociedad Econ√≥mica Matritense de Amigos del Pa√≠s, Torre de los Lujanes n¬∫25: 77-88 The early iglesia de la Santa Cruz, built in 16th century (1583), attached to the Convento de Santo Tomas, also was affected by the fire.  History  J. Laurent (c. 1870.); National Library of Spain. Cloister of the Convento de Santo Tom√°s (c. 1875). The Dominican friars from the convento de Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha founded in 1563 a school of theology with money obtained from the sale of a house that had been donated to them, both far from the urban core of the time. In 1583, at request of Friar Diego de Chaves (Philip II's confessor), it is excised as independent priory. The Count-Duke of Olivares took the new monastery under his protection. In 1635 begins to build the building in Arrabal de Santa Cruz and the works lasted until 1656. The church's facade and dome, both among the most outstanding works of Spanish courtly Baroque, were made by the Jos√© de Churriguera's sons: Jer√≥nimo and Nicol√°s. The church's facade was monumental, distributed the access to the temple in three portals, features of the ornate style of the Churriguera family. The cour d'honneur, two-story, made by Jos√© Jim√©nez Donoso, was considered one of the best architectural works of the 17th century in Madrid. The church was heavily used by many Madrilenian co-fraternities. The Chapel of Santo Domingo in Soriano was well known, owned by Fernando de Fonseca Ruiz de Contreras, Marquis of la Lapilla. In the year 1726 the dome collapsed, killing about 80 people. Several Dominicans died during the anticlerical riots of 1834. The convent building had several uses: it was meeting place for the Landaburian Society; was conditioned to be one of the first headquarters of the Ateneo, prison and barracks for the Milicia Nacional with modifications made by architect Juan Pedro Ayegui. At beginning of 19th century, was settled in the corner of the buildings set the Caf√© de Santa Cruz. On April 13 1872 a fire severely damaged its structures. Four years later, the building collapsed, and as result, was completely demolished. From what was once a Madrilenian religious and cultural institution only remaining a few works of its movable heritage: the excellent painting Santo Domingo en Soriano work by Antonio de Pereda which adorned the Chapel of the Marquis of la Lapilla, preserved in Museo Cerralbo, the Assumption of the Virgin, altar large painting painted by Francisco Ignacio Ruiz de la Iglesia for the Chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves along with the Coronation of the Virgin now are in the Parish church del Corpus Christi in Seville and the sculpture of Our Lady of the Rosary flagship work of Luis Salvador Carmona, venerated in the Oratorio del Olivar.http://eu.museocerralbo.mcu.es/coleccion/galeriaDeImagenes/pintura.html#sala5  References  Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Madrid Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1656 Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1656 Category:Caf√©s Category:Dominican convents Category:Former churches in Spain Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1876 ","title":"Convento de Santo Tom√°s (Madrid)"},{"id":"49084131","text":"K.

Physical geography  The town is located along the banks of the Arno river, at the point where the homonymous Sieci torrent flows (4 km), on the slopes of the Remole hillock (249 m). It borders to the north with Molino del Piano , to the east with the municipal capital, to the south with the hamlet of Villamagna in the municipality of Bagno a Ripoli , and to the west with the hamlet of Compiobbi in the municipality of Fiesole .  History  The village of Sieci is mentioned in the thirteenth century for a place, called Lucente, located among the possessions of the archbishop's mess in Florence near San Martino a Sieci (today Molino del Piano). The toponym is however mentioned to indicate the homonymous torrent as early as the early 11th century . In the early Middle Ages the castle of Remole acquired importance, which was confirmed in 1191 by the emperor Henry VI to the Benedictine nuns of Sant'Ellero , entrusting the patronage of the parish church of San Giovanni and its court to Guido Guerra , Count Palatine of Tuscany . It was reconfirmed to his heirs by Frederick II in 1220 and 1247 . The village of Remole in 1833 had 766 inhabitants. In the mid-nineteenth century , with the opening of the railway station , the hamlet began to expand along the railway track, near the Arno downstream of the castle of Remole, ending up taking on its current name Le Sieci . With its 3,500 inhabitants registered in the 2011 census, Le Sieci is the most populous village in the Municipality.  Monuments and places of interest  Of particular interest are the parish church of San Giovanni , built in the Middle Ages in pure Romanesque style, and the now abandoned Brunelleschi pottery factory, the oldest in the area, dating back to 1774 . Not far away is the church of Saints Martino e Giusto in Quona , while in Gricigliano there is the Villa di Gricigliano , where the international seminary of the Institute of Christ the King High Priest is located .  Anthropic geography  The town is divided into several districts: the center (Le Sieci), Le Sieci di Sotto, Giani and Remole, the historic core of the hamlet. The center of the village overlooks the main Piazza Albizzi.  Economy  In Sieci there are the so-called \\"gualchiere di Remole\\", overlooking the Arno . Their foundation is believed to go back to the mid-14th century (after the 1333 flood ); the first documents on the site date back to 1425 . They represent one of the rare examples of an Italian industrial factory belonging to the late Middle Ages. The ownership of the complex passed through the Albizzi , Rucellai and Valori , then it was owned by Arte della Lana ( 1541 - 1728 ) which, following the cessation of the activity, passed the property to Santa Maria del Fiore. During the Napoleonic era it was then the turn of the Chamber of Commerce of Florence and subsequently of the Municipality of Florence which has owned it since 2009 .  Infrastructure and transport  The hamlet is located along the Aretina road that connects Pontassieve to Florence and is served by its own railway station ( Sieci station ) on the Florence-Rome line .

It supports the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and civilian communities by provision of basic training on Aeronautics, aerospace engineering mechatronics engineering and avionics. It is located in Kaduna state, Northern side of Nigeria. Overview Following the outbreak of the Nigerian civil war, variety of aircraft types and associated weapon systems resulted in a skilled manpower to operate and maintain them. The NAF at that time depended on foreign assistance for manpower development. However, the training vacancies which friendly overseas countries offered the NAF were limited, inadequate and also required huge foreign exchange financing. Consequently, soon after the civil war in 1970, HQ NAF mooted the idea of establishing an indigenous Technical and Supply School. AFIT was founded in 1977 with the name NAF Technical and Supply School (TSS). It was supported by Messrs Dornier of Germany. The institute was renamed in 1979 as Technical Training Wing and was called NAF Technical Training Group (NAF TTG). The group was tasked with the responsibility of providing basic training for NAF personnel in the field of aircraft maintenance, armament and communication. Others are supply management. By the year 2000, its identity was changed to 320 Technical Training Group (320TTG). It was created to manage aircraft and equipment bought during Nigerian Civil War in 1967. The need to keep pace with technological development through increase in manpower capacity building further led to upgrade of most of the certificates awarded by the Institution to a National Diploma, with full accreditation by the National Board for Technical Education, (NBTE). The Institute was also affiliated with Cranfield university, UK for post Graduate Studies in Aerospace Vehicle Design and related fields and it became evident and necessary to effect a change in the nomenclature to reflect the expanded role of the institute. AFIT thus came into being on 12 March 2008. = Faculties = Currently, AFIT comprises 5 faculties, each consisting of various departments. The faculties are: Air Engineering, Computing, Ground and Communication Engineering, Social and Management Sciences and Faculty of Sciences. There is also a School of Postgraduate Studies (SPS). All the basic course curricula are structured to meet the minimum requirements for MSc in the aerospace sector. The institute has so far graduated over 5,689 persons, including personnel of the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Navy and NAF as well as civilians. It is pertinent to state that this number includes foreign students from the Armed Forces of the Republic of Benin, Zimbabwe, Niger, Ghana and Sierra Leone. = AFIT Transformation = The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal SB Abubakar through whose vision to \\"reposition the NAF into a highly professional and disciplined force through capacity building initiatives for effective, efficient and timely employment of air power in response to Nigeria's national security imperatives\\" has helped AFIT to get the NUC accreditation. AFIT has recently recorded a milestone, as it obtained the status of a University. The school was given approval to begin degree programmes on 3 August 2018. Following this new achievement the school will begin its degree programme by September 2018.

He rose to fame in the late 1990s as one of the prominent and founding members of rap group Outsidaz along with fellow rappers Young Zee, D.U., Slang Ton, Az-Izz, Loon, Axe, Yah Yah, Rah Digga and others. The group would later make Detroit rappers Eminem and Bizarre of D12 honorary members of the group after they collaborated with members of the group. Career= Outsidaz = As a founding member of the Outsidaz, Hinds was one of the many MCs to gain a solo career after his group's appearance on the Fugees' successful The Score. With a smooth voice and a sly, clever tone, his raps were often relaxed and thoughtful amidst the large hip-hop crew's various styles. Despite the early solo attempts by many of his bandmates, Hinds waited until they had released their debut, Night Life, on Chris Schwartz's Rough Life Records. That, as well as guest appearances on records from Redman and Rah Digga, was enough to convince Schwartz to ask the MC for a solo record in 2002. With help from Wyclef Jean, Kurupt, and fellow Outsidaz member Young Zee, he put together Won, a collection of funky tracks courtesy of Jay-Z producer Ski that revolved around his charismatic voice and boastful rhymes. Later in the year, he collaborated with the UK trip hop act Morcheeba, who included the rapper on two tracks of Charango. = Solo = In 2004, Hinds released his second album, Telepathy, via Detonator Records, co-produced by himself. After a string of singles in the late 1990s, the rise of former crew member Eminem, and a few years of virtual absence, it seemed that the New Jersey underground rap collective Da Outsidaz would fade into obscurity. However, Hinds managed to find a producer for his gravelly vocals and one-liners in Mr. Green. On The Only Color That Matters Is Green, released in 2008, Mr. Green sets up Hinds' punch line-heavy flow with a barrage of piano loops and soulful horn samples. Hinds released his third solo album, Team Won Inc, via Ascetic Music / Modulor, where he collaborates with his former bandmate D.U. In 2012, Hinds once again collaborates with Mr. Green to release their second album, The Only Number That Matters Is Won, via Raw Poetix Records. This record is notable for collaboration with rappers such as Snoop Dogg and Masta Ace. In 2015, Hinds founded Team Won Incorporated and released his fourth album via his own new record label. He cited the album as a group album introducing his group The Shady Corps. =The Shady Corps= The Shady Corporation, also known as the \\"Shady Corps\\", is a rap group composed of Denton Dawes (\\"Denzy\\"), Robert Boak (\\"S-Ka-Paid\\"), Thomas Wlodarczyk (\\"Miilkbone\\"), DJ Scob, Ill Proceeja, and Hinds himself. It is modeled after the Marine Corps and is also an Eminem tribute band. Honoring and celebrating \\"real\\" hip hop while carrying on the tradition set forth by Eminem, they share a history that is mostly documented in their songs. On \\"Fine Line\\", Eminem explains conditions of their early days in the music industry. Eminem and Hinds have collaborated on numerous songs together such as \\"Take the World\\", \\"Macosa\\", and \\"Rush Ya Clique\\".

The Victorian branch comprises two major wings: the parliamentary wing and the organisational wing. The parliamentary wing comprising all elected party members in the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council, which when they meet collectively constitute the party caucus. The parliamentary leader is elected from and by the caucus, and party factions have a strong influence in the election of the leader. The leader's position is dependent on the continuing support of the caucus (and party factions) and the leader may be deposed by failing to win a vote of confidence of parliamentary members. By convention, the premier sits in the Legislative Assembly, and is the leader of the party controlling a majority in that house. The party leader also typically is a member of the Assembly, though this is not a strict party constitutional requirement. When the Labor party wins sufficient seats to be able to control a majority in the Legislative Assembly, the party leader becomes the State Premier and Labor will form the government. When the party is not in government, the party leader becomes the Leader of the Opposition. To become a Premier or Opposition Leader, the party leader must be or within a short period of time become a member of the Legislative Assembly. Daniel Andrews has been the leader of the party since 3 December 2010 and James Merlino has been deputy party leader since February 2012. At the 2014 state election the ALP in Victoria obtained a majority with 47 of the 88 seats in the Legislative Assembly and formed the Government of Victoria. They then increased their share of seats in the Assembly to 55 after the 2018 election. Andrews has been the Premier of Victoria and Merlino Deputy Premier since 4 December 2014. The party currently has 18 of the 40 seats in the Legislative Council. The Andrews Ministry comprises 22 ministers. Relationship with national party While the National Executive of the ALP is responsible for national campaign strategy, each state and territory is an autonomous branch and is responsible for campaigning in its own jurisdiction for federal, state and local elections. Although many National ALP ideologies were influenced by Victorian Branch. Membership Like all ALP State and territory branches, the membership of the Victorian branch consists of both individual members and affiliated trade unions, who between them decide the party's policies, and elect its governing bodies. Subject to national executive oversight powers, local branches choose candidates for public office, in a process called preselection.Bill Shorten asks ALP's national executive to decide Victorian preselections as tensions riseHow parties choose candidatesLabor faces three contested preselections as pressure ramps up The members and unions elect delegates to state conferences, which decide policy, and elect the state executive, state president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state secretary, which is a full-time professional position. There are also full-time assistant secretary and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches. History=Formative years= While struggling to balance an uneasy alliance of trade unionists and progressive social reformers during the 1890s, the political labor movement in Victoria underwent several changes of name. It was called the Progressive Political League between 1891 and 1894, the United Labor and Liberal Party of Victoria from June 1894, the United Labor Party from 1896 and the Political Labor Council of Victoria from 1901; before becoming the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party.Australian Labor Party Labor members were first elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1894, but the actual numbers are uncertain. They stood as part of the United Labor and Liberal Party, formed in 1894 to replace the Progressive Political League, which won 18 of the 95 seats. At the 1897 election Labor candidates stood as the United Labor Party and won 8 of the 95 seats, all of which had to be contested. Its representation went to 9 of the 95 seats at the 1900 election. Labor candidates contested the 1902 election as the Political Labor Council of Victoria and won 12 of the 95 seats. =George Prendergast and George Elmslie= George Prendergast became the first leader of the parliamentary Labor party in only 1904. At the 1904 election Labor won 17 of the 67 seats, becoming the second largest party in the Assembly, and became the Opposition. At the 1907 election it slipped to 14 of 65 seats; and increased to 21 of 65 seats at the 1908 election. At the 1911 election Labor won 20 of the 65 seats, to 43 for the various factions of the Liberal Party. Prendergast resigned the leadership because of ill-health in 1913, to be succeeded by George Elmslie, who had been elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1902 and became deputy leader in 1912. In December 1913, the Liberal Premier, William Watt, resigned after a dispute with the rural faction of his own party. The acting Governor, John Madden, surprised the Liberals by sending for Elmslie, who on 9 December formed Victoria's first Labor government. Elmslie's tenure as Premier lasted only 14 days, by which time the Liberal factions re-united, and Watt moved a no-confidence motion in Elmslie and resumed office on 22 December. Watt resigned in June 1914 to enter federal politics, and Alexander Peacock returned to leadership. The 1914 election was fought after World War I was declared, and Labor increased its seats to 22, while the Liberals retained 43. The 1916 Labor split occurred over the issue of World War I conscription in Australia which saw pro-conscription Labor members expelled from the party and running as National Labor candidates at the 1917 election. That election also saw the emergence of the Victorian Farmers' Union (the forerunner of the Country Party) as a party. There was also a split in the Nationalist party into rural and city factions and both factions fielded their own candidates. However, Victoria introduced compulsory preferential voting before this election, and most of the preferences resulting from multiple Nationalist candidates were kept within the party. At that election, of the 65 seats, the pro-Ministerial city faction of the Nationalists won 13 seats, while the rural faction won 27. Labor won 18 seats, National Labor won 3 and the VFU won 4. After the election the rural Nationalist faction took control of the party, ousting Premier Alexander Peacock. The Nationalists reunited under Bowser. Elmslie died in 1918 and Prendergast returned to the party's leadership. At the 1920 election Labor won 20 seats to the Nationalists' 30. VFU became a force, holding the balance of power in the Legislative Assembly with 13 seats, a position it held until 1952. In 1920, it supported the conservative Nationalist government. In 1921, the VFU voted with Labor against the Nationalist government when it abolished the compulsory wheat pool operating in the state, leading to a dissolution of Parliament and the 1921 election, which maintained the same balance of power. In April 1924, the VFU, now called the Country Party, again withdrew its support from the Nationalist government when it tried to legislate a reduction in the rural over-representation. Peacock, back in government, called the 1924 election in June, at which Labor won 27 seats, the Nationalists 20 and the Country Party 13. The Country Party supported the minority Labor government in exchange for a number of policy concessions. Prendergast became Premier at the age of 70 ‚Äì the oldest man ever to take the office for the first time. The only real talents in his government were Edmond Hogan as Minister for Agriculture and Railways and William Slater as Attorney-General. John Cain was an Assistant Minister. The Prendergast government was the first Labor government in Victoria able actually to govern. Immediate action was taken to provide shelter for unemployed Victorians, while the government set up royal commissions into the causes of a major police strike in 1923, the prices of bread and flour, and the soldier settlement scheme. Increased expenditure was made available for rural roads, while reductions were made on rail freights and fares. With the support of the Country Party, he was able to pass several bills assisting farmers, but the Country Party would not support anything which benefited Labor's urban working-class base. This was a frustrating situation for Labor ministers, and several urged Prendergast to call another election in the hope of improving their position, but Prendergast was too timid to run the risk. In November the Country Party patched up its differences with the Nationalists, and the two parties joined forces to defeat Prendergast in the Assembly. The Country Party leader, John Allan, succeeded him as Premier. Labor in Victoria in the early federal period was much weaker than in the other states, and there had never been a majority Labor state government. This was partly due to the continuing attraction of Deakinite liberalism among middle-class voters in Melbourne, partly because Victoria did not have the huge pastoral and mining areas that the other mainland states had. The Parliamentary Labor Party remained small and contained limited talent. Victoria was Labor's weakest state throughout the 1920s, due to the gross over-representation of rural areas in the Legislative Assembly, and the strength of the Country Party in rural areas and the Nationalist Party in middle-class Melbourne seats. Labor's parliamentary representation was confined to the industrial areas of Melbourne and a few provincial towns. There was little talent in the Parliamentary Labor Party and few regarded Prendergast as likely ever to win a state election. Most notably, however, the lack of a Labor majority government was due to the high degree of rural over- representation existing in the state's electoral system, which strongly favoured rural electorates to the disadvantage of inner-city electorates, where Labor's vote was concentrated. =Edmond Hogan= Hogan had been elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1913. His was not a natural Labor seat, but it was heavily Irish-Catholic, which helped Hogan, an active Catholic, retain it. In 1914 he was elected to the Labor Party's state executive and in 1922 he became State President. Prendergast resigned as Labor leader in 1926 and was succeeded by Hogan. Hogan was a fine speaker and soon became a leading figure in a parliamentary party which was thin on talent. Victoria was Labor's weakest state and in the 1920s there seemed little chance it would ever win a state election. When Prendergast stepped down in 1926, Hogan was the obvious choice to succeed him. His main drawback was his close association with the Melbourne horse-racing, boxing and gambling identity John Wren, who was widely suspected of corruption. The Wren connection alienated many middle-class voters from Labor through the 1920s and 1930s. Nevertheless, at the 1927 election Hogan was able to capitalise on resentment against rural over-representation in the state Parliament and consequent domination by the Country Party. Labor won 28 seats to the Nationalists 15 and the Country Party's ten. Hogan was able to form a minority government with the support of the four Country Progressive Party and two Liberal members. But this alliance broke down in 1928 in the face a prolonged and violent industrial dispute on the Melbourne waterfront, and in November he was defeated in a confidence vote and resigned, being succeeded by the Nationalist William McPherson with the support of the Country Party. In 1929 the Country Party withdrew its support from the McPherson government, resulting in the 1929 election, fought just as the Great Depression was breaking over Australia. Hogan led Labor to its best result yet, winning 30 seats to the Nationalists' 17 and the Country Party's 11. A collection of Country Progressives, Liberals and independents held the balance, and they agreed to support a second Hogan government. Tom Tunnecliffe was Chief Secretary, John Cain was Minister for Railways and William Slater was Attorney-General. The Great Depression in Australia had a devastating effect on Victoria's economy and society, since the state was heavily dependent on agricultural exports, mainly wheat and wool, for its income, and these industries collapsed almost completely as demand in Britain dried up. By 1931 most Victorian farmers were bankrupt and about 25 percent of the workforce was unemployed. Hogan's government, in common with all other governments, had no solution to this disaster. Even if the Labor government was minded to attempt radical solutions, it was dependent on Country Progressive support in the Assembly, and had only six members in the Legislative Council. Hogan adopted the orthodox economic view that governments must balance their budgets, and since the Council would not permit any increases in taxation, the only way to do this in the face of falling government revenue was to cut expenditure. This increased the burdens on the poor and unemployed, while providing no stimulus to the economy. There was little possibility of effective unemployment relief, although there were some government works to soak up unemployment, such as the Shrine of Remembrance and the Great Ocean Road. In August 1930 Hogan attended a conference with the other Premiers and the Labor Prime Minister, James Scullin, to consider what to do. On the advice of Sir Otto Niemeyer, a senior official of the Bank of England (which controlled most of Victoria's access to credit in the City of London), they agreed to radical cuts to government spending and borrowing. This provoked a storm of protest in the Labor Party and trade unions, who regarded Scullin and Hogan as traitors. A second conference in June 1931 produced the Premiers' Plan, which entailed further cuts in government spending, accompanied by increases in taxation on the wealthy. In the circumstances both of these measures further depressed the economy, while not satisfying either side of politics. The 1931 Labor split occurred, with a breakaway NSW Labor Party led by Jack Lang rebelled and brought down the Scullin government in November, but Hogan survived with Country Party continued support from the cross benches. In any case the Nationalists, now renamed the United Australia Party (UAP) preferred to see Hogan implement the Premiers' Plan. In February 1932 Hogan traveled to London to talk to the banks about Victoria's desperate economic plight. While he was away Tom Tunnecliffe was acting Premier, and he was much more willing than Hogan to reject the Premiers' Plan. As a result, the Country Party withdrew its support, and in April the government was defeated in a confidence vote. Tunnecliffe replaced Hogan as Labor leader and led the Labor campaign in May 1932 election, now rejecting the Premiers' Plan completely. The Labor Party Executive expelled everyone who had supported the Premiers' Plan, including Hogan, although it did not run a candidate against him. At the elections the UAP won 31 seats to Labor's 16 and the reunited Country Party's 14. Hogan and one of his ex- ministers were elected as \\"Premiers' Plan Labor\\" candidates. UAP leader Stanley Argyle became Premier. After sitting as an independent for four years, Hogan joined the Country Party in 1935, and formed a close relationship with the Country Party leader Albert Dunstan. The result was a renewed alliance between the Country Party and Labor, brokered by Hogan, John Wren and the Victorian Labor State President, Arthur Calwell. In April 1935 Dunstan walked out of Argyle's government, and became Premier with Labor support. Hogan became Minister for Agriculture and Mines, and held these posts through Dunstan's record term as Premier until September 1943. =John Cain I= John Cain I was assistant minister for agriculture in the short-lived minority Prendergast Labor government in 1924, a minister without portfolio in the first minority Hogan Labor government (1927‚Äì28), and minister for railways and for electrical undertakings in the second Hogan government (1929‚Äì32). When Hogan's government collapsed during the Great Depression and Hogan himself was expelled from the Labor Party, Cain became party deputy leader under Tunnecliffe. Cain succeeded Tunnecliffe as Labor leader in 1937. Under both Tunnecliffe and Cain, Labor supported the Dunstan minority Country Party government from 1935 to 1943. At the 1943 election, Labor, now led by John Cain, benefiting from the popularity of John Curtin's wartime federal government, won 22 of the 65 seats. Dunstan resigned on 14 September 1943 and John Cain formed government, which lasted only 4 days. The conservative parties resolved their differences and Dunstan resumed office and retained it with Labor support until November 1945, when Dunstan resigned again. Cain again became premier on 21 November 1945. Labor's lower house parliamentary position was much better than it had been in 1943, since the 1945 election had given Labor 31 seats to the Country Party's 18 and the Liberals' 13, with three independents. With a majority in neither House, Cain's government was unable to pass much legislation. On 2 October 1947 the Victorian Legislative Council blocked his government's budget to show its opposition to the federal Labor government of Ben Chifley, which had announced plans to nationalise the private banks. Although this issue had nothing to do with state politics, Cain was forced to resign and call the 1947 election for 8 November, at which Labor was heavily defeated. The 1950 election gave Labor 24 seats to the Liberals' 27 and the Country Party's 13. Since the Liberals and Country Party hated each other, no stable majority government was possible, and this, together with the unpopularity of the new federal Liberal government, gave Cain his opportunity. In October 1952 the Country Party premier, John McDonald, resigned and called the 1952 election. Labor won 37 seats, the first time it had won a majority in the lower house, and Cain formed his third government. Cain's government was hampered by the hostility of the Legislative Council (which until 1950 had been elected on a restricted property-based franchise and so always had a conservative majority), and also by tensions within his own party. During the war the Communist Party had grown greatly in strength in the trade unions which controlled and funded the Labor Party, leading a faction of anti- Communist Catholics to form within the party to fight Communist influence. (This body, known as The Movement, was organised by B. A. Santamaria and supported by the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, Daniel Mannix). Conflict between left and right in the Labor Party grew increasingly bitter in the Cold War atmosphere of the 1950s. Nevertheless, the Cain government was able to pass more legislation than any previous Labor government in Victoria had done. Major reforms were carried out in the areas of workers' compensation, tenancy law, long service leave, hospitals, public transport, housing, charities and the Crimes Act. Changes included the provision on long-service leave to railway workers, increased eligibility to workers' compensation, alterations to the Shops and Factories Act and the Landlord and Tenant Act, and the introduction of legislation \\"to penalize rogues who resorted to fraudulent misrepresentation in soliciting corporate investment from the public.\\" The government had also reformed wage determination procedures and public service administration, while constructive initiatives were carried out in adult education and soil conservation.Ross McMullin, The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891‚Äì1991 Even some reforms to the electoral system were carried through the Council, where Labor and Liberal members united to reduce the malapportionment which had given the Country Party disproportionate representation since the 1920s. In its first two years the Cain government won the approval of the Melbourne daily papers The Age, The Herald and The Argus. Nevertheless, Cain's third Government fell on 19 April 1955 when 19 expelled Labor lower house members aligned to \\"The Movement\\" \\"crossed the floor\\" against the government in a no-confidence vote. The 1955 Labor split began in October 1954 after the federal leader, Dr H. V. Evatt, blamed Santamaria and his supporters in the Victorian Labor Party for Labor's loss of seats at the 1954 federal election. Santamaria exercised strong influence in the Cain government through \\"Movement\\" linked ministers such as Bill Barry and Frank Scully. Protestant and left-wing ministers strongly opposed the Movement faction. In December 1953 the Lands Minister, Robert Holt, resigned rather than introduce a Santamaria-influenced bill which would have promoted the settlement of Italian immigrants as small farmers in Gippsland. In early 1955 the Labor Party's federal executive dissolved the state executive and began to expel Santamaria's supporters from the party. The Victorian branch then split between pro-Evatt and pro-Santamaria factions, and in March the pro-Evatt State Executive suspended 24 members of State Parliament suspected of being Santamaria supporters. Four ministers were forced to resign from the government. When the Parliament met on 19 April 19 expelled Labor members crossed over to vote with the Liberal and Country Party members to defeat the government. At the ensuing May 1955 election, the expelled members and others stood as the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist), later the Democratic Labor Party. Their strategy was to draw votes from the Labor Party and direct preferences to the Liberal Party. Labor was heavily defeated, winning only 20 seats, from the 37 at the 1952 election, to the Liberals' 34 and the Country Party's ten. Only one of the expelled Labor members was re-elected. Cain suffered a stroke on 9 August 1957 and died, aged 75. Alfred Ernest \\"Ernie\\" Shepherd (1901‚Äì58) succeeded Cain as party leader, only to die himself little more than a year afterwards. From 1958 to 1967 Clive Stoneham was Labor and Opposition Leader. He lost the 1961, 1964 and 1967 elections to the incumbent Liberal Premier, Henry Bolte, with the electoral assistance of the Democratic Labor Party, which directed its preferences to the Liberals. =Clyde Holding= Clyde Holding became party leader in 1967. During the 1970 state election campaign, which some commentators suggested Labor could win as a result of voter fatigue with the Liberals after their 15 years in power, Holding campaigned on the new federal policy of supporting state aid to non- government schools. However, in the week before the election, the left-wing state president, George Crawford and state secretary, Bill Hartley, issued a statement saying that a Victorian Labor government would not support state aid. As a result, federal leader Gough Whitlam refused to campaign for Labor in Victoria, and Holding was forced to repudiate his own policy. At the election, the Bolte government.was returned. This episode led directly to federal intervention in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. In 1971 the left-wing leadership was overturned by the National Executive and allies of Whitlam, Hawke and Holding took control. The left then formed an organised faction, the Socialist Left, to agitate for socialist policies, supported by some unions. This continuing conflict in the party made it difficult for Holding to oppose the Liberal government effectively. The surge in support for federal Labor which saw Whitlam elected Prime Minister in 1972 was not reflected in Victorian state politics. Bolte retired in 1972, and his successor, Dick Hamer, comfortably won the 1973 and 1976 state elections. Frank Wilkes became party leader in 1977. At the 1979 state election, Labor under Wilkes gained eleven seats, the party's best showing for many years,Michael O'Grady (1979), 'The party leaders: Hamer and Wilkes,' in Peter Hay, Ian Ward, John Warhurst (eds.), Anatomy of an Election, Hill of Content, Melbourne, Victoria, pages 91‚Äì104. though not sufficient to form government. =John Cain II= John Cain II, son of the former Labor premier, became party leader in September 1981, and won the 1982 election, winning 49 of the 81 seats in the Legislative Assembly, forming a Labor government for the first time since 1955. In 1984 the Labor government legalised prostitution in Victoria. At the 1985 election Labor won 47 of the 88 seats; and 46 seats at the 1988 election. Cain's political support collapsed in August 1990. By this time the Labor government was in deep crisis, with some of the state's financial institutions on the brink of insolvency, the budget deficit unsustainably high and growing and the Labor Party deeply divided on how to respond to the situation. =Joan Kirner= Cain resigned and Joan Kirner was elected Labor leader, becoming the party's first female leader and Victoria's first female premier. The party hoped that the elevation of a popular woman as its new leader would improve its position, but Kirner never succeeded in gaining control of the crisis into which the state had plunged. The conservative-leaning Melbourne newspaper, the Herald Sun, reacted unfavourably to a premier from the Socialist Left, dubbing her \\"Mother Russia\\". She was lampooned alternatively as a sinister commissar and as a frumpy housewife in a polka dot dress. She seemed unfazed by the Herald Sun and gradually won some respect, though she was unable to improve significantly the government's standing. During 1991 and 1992 Kirner took several decisions to cut government spending and raise revenue to some extent. However, her government failed to cut spending in many areas including education. Most of the Kirner government's attempts to cut spending were actively opposed by trade unions and some members of the government. The interest bill alone was $3.5 billion per year, the government sold off trains and trams and leased them back. Another decision was the sale in 1991 of the state-owned State Bank of Victoria, now on the verge of collapse, to the Commonwealth Bank.Hugo Armstrong (1992), \\"The Tricontinental Affair\\", in Mark Considine and Brian Costar (eds.), Trials in Power. Cain, Kirner and Victoria 1982‚Äì1992, Melbourne University Press, Carlton, Chapter 3 Liberal leader Alan Brown persuaded the Nationals to contest the next election as a Coalition,Brown, Alan John, re- member (Parliament of Victoria). the first time the two main non-Labor parties in Victoria had fought an election together since 1950, before Brown was deposed as Liberal leader by Jeff Kennett in 1991. Kirner went into 1992 knowing she faced a statutory general election, one which opinion polls gave her virtually no chance of winning. She waited as long as she could, finally calling an election for October. It was obvious as soon as the writs were dropped that Labor would not win a fourth term. Although she remained personally more popular than Kennett, it was not nearly enough to overcome the electorate's anger at her party. The Coalition's \\"Guilty Party\\" campaign did much to stoke this anger, targeting many ministers in the Kirner Government and providing examples of concerns in their portfolios. The Coalition won the election in a landslide, scoring a 19-seat swing ‚Äì the second-worst defeat that a sitting government has ever suffered in Victoria. The Liberals won enough seats that they could have governed in their own right. Kirner remained Opposition Leader until March 1993 and resigned from Parliament in May 1994. Jim Kennan was a member of parliament between 1982 and 1993, initially in the Victorian Legislative Council, and then in the Legislative Assembly and was Deputy Premier of Victoria from 1990 to 1992. He became the Leader of the Opposition after Kirner resigned in March 1993, until his shock retirement from Parliament three months later. =Brumby and Bracks period= Kennan was succeeded as leader by John Brumby, who was a member of the Legislative Council at the time. Brumby transferred to the Legislative Assembly in a by- election for Kennan's seat. The defeat of the federal Labor government in March 1996 prompted Kennett to call an early state election three weeks later. Labor led by Brumby only managed a net two-seat gain, leaving it 20 seats behind the Coalition. Brumby was replaced as Labor leader in March 1999 by Steve Bracks. To everyone's surprise, Bracks won the September 1999 election, which produced a hung parliament and the independents agreed to support the minority Labor government. Labor won the 2002 state election in a landslide, taking 62 seats out of 88 in the Legislative Assembly, also winning a slim majority in the Legislative Council. In 2002, Labor reformed the Legislative Council and brought in four-year fixed-term parliaments.Electoral Act 2002 (Vic) and The Constitution (Parliamentary Reform) Act 2003 Labor made inroads towards same-sex equality in Victoria. Since 2001, Victorian Labor governments have amended 60 Acts to advance same-sex equality. Labor won a third term at the 2006 state election. Bracks resigned as party leader and Premier on 27 July 2007, and Labor deputy leader, John Thwaites also announced his resignation on the same day. John Brumby was elected unopposed Labor leader on 30 July 2007 and became Premier. One notable achievement of the Brumby government was abortion law reform in 2008. It also signed contracts for the Wonthaggi desalination plant in 2009, to drought-proof the State. At the 2010 state election Labor was narrowly defeated, winning only 43 of the 88 Legislative Assembly seats. =Daniel Andrews= Brumby resigned as party leader soon after Labor loss at the 2010 state election, to be replaced by Daniel Andrews on 3 December 2010. After being in Opposition for one term, Labor won the 2014 state election from the Napthine Government, winning 47 seats in the Legislative Assembly. On winning office, the Andrews government cancelled the East West Link project and initiated the level crossing removal project and the Melbourne Metro Rail Project. On 24 May 2016 Andrews made an official apology in parliament for gay men in Victoria punished during the time homosexuality was a crime in the state.Priess, Benjamin Gay men receive apology more than 30 years after homosexuality decriminalised May 24, 2016 The Age Retrieved 25 May 2016 In September 2016, the Andrews government privatized the Port of Melbourne for a term of 50 years in return for more than $9.7 billion, to be used for infrastructure improvements. At the 2018 state election, the Andrews Government was returned for a second term with an increased majority, winning 55 seats in the Legislative Assembly, but 18 of the 40 seats in the Legislative Council. Branch-stacking allegations On 14 June 2020, The Age and Nine Network released covert recordings purporting to show state minister Adem Somyurek organising branch stacking within Victorian Labor. The following morning, Somyurek was sacked from the ministry by Andrews and he resigned from the party. Two other ministers, Robin Scott and Marlene Kairouz, who were also alleged to be accomplices of Somyurek, also resigned from the ministry. On 17 June 2020, former Labor Premier Steve Bracks and former federal Labor deputy leader Jenny Macklin were appointed as administrators of Victorian Labor by the party's National Executive until early 2021. The pair will review the state party‚Äôs operations and provide detailed recommendations to tackle the issue of branch-stacking within the party. Additionally, voting rights of all members were suspended and preselection processes in Victoria will be controlled by the National Executive.

Her design showcased the latest sensing technologies that allow visitors to engage with the stories on display through immersive embodied interactions. She designed a highly theatrical space in which technology animates historical characters and places to foster playful learning driven by the public's own spontaneous curiosity and engagement. Sparacino collaborated with Zaha Hadid Architects in 2011 on the National Art Museum of China project (NAMOC). Inspired by the ancient Chinese art of calligraphy, her contribution involved designing large-scale interactive projections that transformed the museum floor into beautifully rendered calligraphic brushstrokes that guided visitors through the exhibits. A mobile application was also created to conduct customized tours based on a visitor's preferences. In 2012 she worked with KR Architects to create the winning bid for the Museum of Contemporary Architecture (MoCA)Urban Constellation - Museum of Contemporary Architecture Exhibition Scheme / K/R Architects in Hangzhou, China. In this project Sparacino designed a reconfigurable street using two parallel screens up to six meters high and concealed projectors to reproduce the experience of walking in a major city. In 2013 Sparacino worked with Vodafone ItalyAn Experiential Customer Journey with Vodafone, 2015 to design, engineer, and develop software for an invite-only 10,000 sq feet interactive showroom to creatively unveil new enterprise products to CEOs, high-level executives, city officials, and journalists.

She unloaded the sugar, then loaded 15 tons of bark and some wheat, and proceeded up the coast on 2 February to Port Wakefield to load more wheat, intending to return to Port Adelaide then return to England. The ship encountered a violent squall on the way from Port Wakefield back to Port Adelaide carrying the bark and a total of 4025 bags of wheat and sank without trace. The 16 people on board (captain, 13 crew and two stevedores) were all rescued, but the hull was not located until 1983. The wreck Despite several searches and a ¬£100 reward in the weeks following the sinking, Zanoni was not found in 1867. A new attempt to find it in the early 1980s gained information from a retired fisherman and the wreck was found and identified, about northeast of the position the survivors had reported, southeast of Ardrossan, in of water. The site of the wreck of Zanoni is now protected by a exclusion zone declared under the South Australian Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981 on 26 May 1983. No boating of any kind is permitted inside this zone, in an attempt to protect what remains of the ship from damage from fishing nets and boat anchors. The No 5 dumb hopper barge was scuttled in 1984 south of Zanoni to provide an alternate artificial reef for fishing.

When in England he generally served in the Anglican church, but in Scotland he served in the Episcopalian church.  Early life  He was born on 10 December 1810, the son of Alexander Garden (b.1786), a Glasgow merchant, and Rebecca, daughter of Robert Menteith, esq., of Carstairs. They stayed at 110 Argyll Street.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1810 After home-tutoring he attended Glasgow University from whence he passed to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his degree of B.A. in 1833 and M.A. in 1836. In 1833 he obtained the Hulsean prize for an essay on the ‚ÄòAdvantages accruing from Christianity.‚Äô At Cambridge he belonged to the set of which Richard Chenevix Trench, F. D. Maurice, and John Sterling were among the leaders, whose intimate friendship, together with that of Edmund Lushington and George Stovin Venables, he enjoyed. His name occurs frequently in Trench's early letters (Memorials, i. 118, 182, 186, 236, &c.;), and he was Trench's companion in Rome and its environs in January 1835.  Career  He was consecrated as a priest in 1836 and originally served briefly in London , before gaining a post as Curate to Sir Herbert Oakeley at Bocking in Essex. In 1838‚Äì9 he was curate to Julius Charles Hare at Hurstmonceaux in Sussex, succeeding after an interval his friend Sterling. There was hardly sufficient sympathy between Garden and Hare for him to stay long as his curate, and he removed in 1839 to the curacy of St James's Church, Piccadilly, from which he became successively the incumbent of Holy Trinity Church, Blackheath Hill (1840‚Äì4). In 1844, following the Disruption of 1843 in the Scottish church and a new religious climate, he returned to Scotland. Here he served at St Paul‚Äôs Episcopal Chapel,Scottish Episcopal Clergy 1689-2000 on Carrubber's Close (demolished 1880). Despite being small the chapel held 550 persons. His final role (1859 until death) was as Sub-Dean of the Chapel Royal at Holyrood Palace (succeeding Dr Wesley) directly serving Queen Victoria. In this role he would be given lodgings in or close to the palace. In 1848 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Charles Terrot. He died on 10 May 1884. He is thought to be buried in the burial ground of Holyrood Abbey next to the palace. Publications In 1841 he undertook the editorship of the Christian Remembrancer, which he retained for some years. In his earlier years Garden attached himself to the Oxford school, which was then exercising a powerful attraction over thoughtful minds. Trench describes a sermon he heard him preach in 1839 on ‚Äòthe anger of God,‚Äô as ‚ÄòNewmanite and in parts very unpleasant.‚Äô He subsequently became somewhat of a broad churchman, adopting the teaching of F. D. Maurice on the incarnation, the atonement, and other chief Christian doctrines, and contributing several thoughtful essays to the series of ‚ÄòTracts for Priests and People,‚Äô a literary organ of that school. The bent of his mind was essentially philosophical, disinclined to rest in any bare dogmatic statements without probing them to the bottom to discover the intellectual basis on which they rested. In 1844 he published ‚ÄòDiscourses on Heavenly Knowledge and Heavenly Love,‚Äô followed in 1853 by ‚ÄòLectures on the Beatitudes.‚Äô A pamphlet on the renunciation of holy orders, then beginning to be debated, appeared in 1870 under the title ‚ÄòCan an Ordained Man become a Layman?‚Äô ‚ÄòAn Outline of Logic‚Äô was issued in 1867, which came to a second edition in 1871.

The Stockholm police had received 38 reports of sexual harassment at We Are Sthlm in 2014 and 2015 together, from female visitors at the festival, most of whom were under 15 years of age, but had not publicized these reported harassments in their press releases then. Police spokesperson Varg Gyllander in 2016, during the commotion about the 2015‚Äì16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, suggested that this non-reporting in 2015 and 2014 may partly have been caused by fear of the police to \\"talk about these things in the context of the immigration debate today\\". Background We Are Sthlm was established as a summer music festival for youth in 2000 under the name \\"Ung08\\" with free yearly public concerts and events in central Stockholm.Ung is Swedish for \\"young\\" and 08 is the area code for the greater Stockholm area. The venture was successful and received support from Stockholm Municipality in 2003. In 2013, the festival was attended by 160,000 people and changed its name to \\"We Are Sthlm\\". Rapes were reported at Swedish music festivals at Arvika in 2006 and 2010, at Emmaboda in 2014, and at Br√•valla in 2015. At the Arvika festivals, the police publicized reports of rape but characterized both events as \\"calm\\". 2014 and 2015 festivals In 2014 and 2015 together, 38 incidents of sexual harassment at We Are Sthlm were reported to the police by female visitors at the festival, most of whom were under 15 years of age, but the Stockholm police did not publicize about these alleged harassments in their press releases then, also the assaults seem to not have been fully investigated. A police spokesman played down the scale of these harassment incidents: around 15 of such reports, by 170,000 people for five days gathered in an open youth music festival, \\"is still too many, but also not very much\\". In connection to the 2015 festival, Sveriges Radio in August 2015 reported that sexual harassment had occurred that year, and that festival had been plagued by the same problems for several years. Newspaper Dagens Nyheter on 10 January 2016, during the commotion over the 2015‚Äì16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, had obtained internal documents from the police and wrote about what they now framed as a police cover-up of sex assaults. Dagens Nyheter analyzed that sexual harassment had been a problem since the festival started in 2000, but that the information had been withheld due to concern for the reputation of the event. Police spokesperson Varg Gyllander on 11 January 2016 suggested that the non-reporting in 2015 and 2014 had been \\"\\"self censorship\\" on the part of individual officers\\", as certain \\"police employees ... are afraid of talking about these things in the context of the immigration debate today\\". 2016 media coverage On 9 January, crime reporter Lasse Wierup published an article in newspaper Dagens Nyheter as a reaction to the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, especially in Cologne. Wierup pointed to the similarity of the German assaults to reports of incidents in Kalmar and at the We Are Sthlm festival in August 2015. Wierup was critical of the absence of media attention and posed questions on the reasons for the lack of attention and what it meant for the safety of women in public spaces. Dagens Nyeter received a tip about the event, but failed to get it verified. The following day, Dagens Nyheter published an article criticizing the Stockholm police for withholding the information in their media communication, and pointed to something as the reason for not reporting on the assaults. The story received international attention, partly as it was broken shortly after sexual assaults in various German cities and the Swedish city of Malm√∂ over the New Year. The Guardian reported that police and \\"the media\\" were alleged to have \\"deliberately under-report[ed]\\" the assaults in order to not increase anti-immigrant sentiment. According to one memo, police in 2015 were told to be vigilant of young men sexually assaulting women in the crowd, as the previous year such offences had been committed, mostly by migrants, including Afghans. David Brax, a scholar of hate crimes at the University of Gothenburg, hypothesised that police were concerned there would be revenge attacks against other migrants if the crimes were made public, but also predicted that a cover-up would vindicate the far-right's belief that the media do not report on migrant crime. National police commissioner Dan Eliasson ordered an internal review with the possibility of disciplinary action or criminal proceedings if police had committed any offences. The Prime Minister of Sweden, Stefan L√∂fven, said that the women assaulted were victims of a \\"double betrayal\\" and promised to respond quickly to address the events. A 15-year-old boy was arrested on 11 January 2016 on charges of assault and sexual assault against two 14-year-old girls at the summer 2015 festival.  2018 festival  After closing the festival earlier and changing order of the acts they managed to get a 90% decrease of the number of incidents. Reactions Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven harshly criticised the police: \\"I feel a very strong anger that young women are not able to go to a music festival without being offended, sexually harassed and attacked... It is a major democratic problem for the whole of our country,\\" he said of the police failure to release timely information of the incidents to the public. Allegations of media cover-up There were accusations of media cover-ups. The Sweden Democrats, a social conservative, anti-immigration party, claimed in January 2016 that DN had been made aware of the crimes, but had not reported them because it would have benefited the Sweden Democrats' agenda. In an anonymous interview with Norwegian magazine Journalisten, a psychologist claimed to have given DN the tip, strongly criticizing the paper for not reacting. DN editor Caspar Opitz has rejected the accusations, claiming that his newspaper investigated the tip seriously but could not confirm it. Answering questions, Opitz wrote that his staff had made multiple attempts to investigate, and had even found that some of the information in the tip (for example, that large numbers of people had been arrested) was not true. He further stated that the scarcity of leads meant that not even alternative media had covered the story.

It was designed by Eddie Oribin and built from 1958 to 1959 by Les Tinsley & Co. It is also known as St Paul's Anglican Memorial Church and Proserpine Church of England. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 October 2013.  History  St Paul's Anglican Church in Proserpine, completed in 1959, is one of a series of innovative churches designed by Cairns-based architect Edwin Henry (Eddie) Oribin. It was constructed by local builder Les Tinsley and Co. with engineering details provided by R McLean. The church is made from a variety of materials including brick, timber and concrete, and features a striking parabolic roof of laminated timber arches, an early use of this structural system in Queensland. The Proserpine area was first settled from the 1860s and agriculture became the main industry. An initial attempt at sugar cane production in the early 1880s at Glen Isla plantation failed and the estate was subsequently sold and subdivided into small farms. Much of the present-day Proserpine town area occupies land formerly part of the plantation site. A stable sugar-growing industry was eventually established in Proserpine in 1897 with the opening of the Proserpine Central Mill. By 1900, there were 200 settlers and 70 suppliers to the mill. Anglican services in Proserpine, which was then part of Bowen Parish, had been established by 1896 when church services were conducted by a visiting clergyman from Bowen. In 1904 a building committee was formed to oversee the establishment of a Church of England in Proserpine, so that regular services could be held and a Sunday School set up. Fundraising was undertaken, and by early 1905 the committee had secured a site in Main Street, opposite the mill. The first St Paul's Church of England, a small timber building, was completed in 1906. Proserpine continued to grow throughout the early 20th century, with the population nearly doubling in the 1920s and a rail link to Mackay, completing the North Coast railway line from Brisbane to Townsville, opening in 1923. However, until the 1950s Proserpine remained a country sugar town, a stopover place rather than a destination in itself, with little appeal to visitors. Proserpine Airport opened in late 1951, boosting tourism to the local area and Whitsunday Islands. The 1950s were a significant period of change and reform within Anglican and other Christian denominations throughout Australia, as they sought to become more relevant to contemporary society. Developments in religious theology and liturgy, coupled with an expansionary building program, led to a radical departure from established architectural traditions. Reflecting international trends, church designs moved away from historical revival styles and became increasingly influenced by Modernism. However, it was expected that a church would still be recognisable as such, resulting in a wide range of variations combining traditional church elements, symbols and functions with new construction techniques, materials and forms. A particular advocate of constructing churches in a modern idiom was Bishop Ian Shevill, the sixth Anglican Bishop of North Queensland (enthroned in 1953), who began a crusade to provide a permanent church in every parish. Having travelled to the United States of America to learn new methods of fundraising, Shevill implemented the Anglican Building Crusade, which raised ¬£145,000 for buildings. Of the amount raised by each parish, half was retained and half went to the diocese. In order to encourage construction of modern rather than pseudo-Gothic style churches, the Bishop compiled a set of canonical principles of church architecture, which were a set of rules ensuring certain aspects of Anglican church designs remained constant while allowing architects to exercise their creativity. These principles prescribed such things as setting aside a third of the church for the sanctuary and two thirds for the nave, the proportions of steps leading up to the altar, and that furnishings be designed by the architect. All new Anglican churches were to be individual and contemporary in design, for, as Shevill himself put it: \\"God is no museum piece and He should be worshipped by modern people in modern buildings which are aesthetically pleasing and cool\\". By 1958, six new permanent Anglican churches and a chapel had been completed according to these principles. Steps towards constructing a new church at Proserpine began in 1956 when architects Barnes and Oribin of Cairns were engaged. Designed by Oribin, the proposed church was highly unusual, with a parabolic roofed nave, glazed end wall with a central concrete cross, flat side roofs and separate brick tower. Edwin Henry (Eddie) Oribin was born in Cairns in 1927. As a teenager during World War II, he spent time in Brisbane where he obtained work with the Allison Aircraft Division of General Motors rebuilding aircraft engines. Returning to Cairns in 1944, Oribin commenced architectural training with Sidney George Barnes, Chief Architect of the Allied Works Council for North Queensland, whose training gave Oribin a solid grounding in structural design and construction. In 1950 Oribin moved to Brisbane to work and study, and on 10 February 1953 he obtained his registration as an architect in Queensland, returning to Cairns the following month to begin a partnership with Barnes. This partnership lasted until Barnes' death in 1959, after which Oribin continued practicing on his own. Oribin undertook a wide range of work in North Queensland between 1953 and 1973. Throughout his career, he was devoted to experimenting with different structural and aesthetic ideas, drawing inspiration from a wide variety of Australian and international publications. Characteristics of Oribin's work included meticulous detailing, structural creativity and concern for the modulation of light. He was also known for his model-making skills and superb craftsmanship, often creating objects himself. St Paul's Anglican Church at Proserpine was one of three churches designed by Oribin between 1956 and 1960, the others being Mareeba Uniting Church (formerly Methodist Church, completed 1960) and St Andrew's Presbyterian Memorial Church, Innisfail (completed 1960). Each of these churches is distinctive in design, having directly responded to the needs of the clients, while still allowing experimentation with construction and design ideas. By mid-1958 Proserpine parish's participation in the Anglican Building Crusade had raised over ¬£3000 and their own fundraising campaign was supported and encouraged by Bishop Shevill, who stated \\"...I should like to congratulate the wardens and council upon their adoption of a design which is so revolutionary and so progressive, for it will provide the parish with a contemporary building of great beauty and one which will make religion relevant to the 20th Century people who believe in progress...\\". The original timber church was relocated to the rear of the property and Cairns contractors Les Tinsley and Co. began construction of the new St Paul's in June 1958. The Governor of Queensland, Col. Sir Henry Abel Smith, laid the foundation stone in a ceremony on 9 July, during which he inspected a model of the proposed new church and discussed the building with the architect. Constructed on site, the main parabolic frames of St Paul's Church were of laminated timber, with the exception of the front frame which was made of pre-cast concrete. The first two laminated arches constructed were used as the basis for the formwork of the front concrete arch. The unusual form of the nave with its exposed internal structure led to it being compared to World War II igloos. With their large curved trusses made from small pieces of timber, igloos were a familiar building type to Oribin who had worked in the Allison Overhaul Assembly Plant igloos at Albion during World War II. The parabolic arch has been associated with church architecture since at least the 1880s. German architect Dominikus Bohm (1880-1955) exploited the possibilities of the parabolic arch in several 1920s church designs, demonstrating that the kind of atmosphere commonly associated with Gothic architecture could be obtained with a minimum of historical allusion. Though it remained an uncommon architectural form in the early 20th century, it featured in several Modernist churches, most notably the Church of St Francis of Assisi (completed 1943) in Pampulha, Brazil, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012). Constructed from cast in-situ concrete, the nave of the church was a free- standing parabolic vault. Highly controversial at the time, Niemeyer's bold design was extremely influential among architects around the world (including Australia), with photographs and plans of the church published in architectural journals. The parabolic form of St Paul's was made possible by the use of glued laminated timber for the internal arches. Laminated timber arches, constructed by overlapping and bolting together small pieces of timber to make a single, large member, have been in use in Australia since the mid-19th century. Cost-effective and able to span large distances without intermediate posts, laminated timber arches also became an alternative system for roof structures of large buildings such as markets, factories and, from the early 20th century, large auditoria and picture theatres. The process of glue lamination, using casein glue to bond the layers of timber rather than bolts, originated in Germany before being introduced to the United States in the 1920s. Several publications in the 1930s and early 1940s provided the necessary data for constructing glued laminated timber arches, and became a source of inspiration for Australian designers. The earliest experiments in Australia took place in the early 1940s and the arrival of powerful synthetic resin adhesives in the post- World War II period increased the reliability and range of applications of glue lamination. The former Burge Bros Factory in Melbourne (1945‚Äì46) is considered to be the oldest known surviving example of this technology in Australia, with semi-circular arches spanning , manufactured by Sydney-based company Ralph Symonds Ltd. Despite the technology being available, it wasn't until the 1950s, when curved shapes such as conoids and hyperbolic parabolas became fashionable, that glue laminated arches were more commonly used in Australia, particularly for church structures. Recognising the structural and aesthetic potential of this new technology, Oribin specified glue laminated timber arches for two of his earliest buildings, the Mareeba Shire Hall and Proserpine's St Paul's Church; both were designed in 1956 and completed within 5 years, making them an early use of the technology in Queensland. St Paul's was completed first, with engineering details for both buildings provided by Cairns engineer R McLean. Oribin designed all aspects of the church, including internal fixtures and furnishings, and his attention to detail led him to personally craft some items. Timber furniture included the baptismal font, lectern, pulpit, candle holders, stools and pews. A pair of aumbry cupboard doors, depicting stylised interpretations of Saints Peter and Paul, were designed and routed by Oribin himself. Oribin also personally produced seven acid-etched copper panels, each depicting one of the sacraments, to ornament the baptismal font lid. Other copper work for the sanctuary lights, candle holders and spun copper font were designed by Oribin and produced in Sydney. His work was so valued by the Proserpine congregation that, years after the church was completed, Oribin was contacted by them to design and detail a simple noticeboard. The total cost of the finished church came to ¬£22,000. It was dedicated by Bishop Shevill on 4 July 1959, coinciding with American Independence Day. During the ceremony a memorial plaque was unveiled by ET Bourne, the second secretary of the US Embassy in Canberra. The design of the church attracted a great deal of attention from locals and visitors, as well as the wider Anglican community. In the September 1960 edition of \\"The Northern Churchman,\\" the church is praised both for its beauty and iconic status: > \\"The Proserpine building is judged by competent critics to be one of the > most imaginative and beautiful conceptions amongst our Parish Churches in > which every detail of colour and form has been true to the Canons of Liturgy > and Art. It is without doubt the finest building in this town and a tribute > to the parish.\\" Local newspaper \\"The Proserpine Guardian\\" speculated that Proserpine \\"may be known increasingly not just as a sugar town, or even as the jumping off ground for the famed Whitsunday Islands, but as the town with THAT CHURCH\\". When completed, the parabolic roof was clad in flat aluminium sheeting, folded over angled timber fillets which ran horizontally along the length of the roof. Panels of translucent corrugated fibreglass sheeting ran along the apex and in six vertical strips at the southern end. By 1968, problems with leaking led to the roof sheeting being replaced with corrugated aluminium. Repairs and changes have been made since and all of the original translucent sections of the parabolic roof have been replaced with opaque sheeting. Thus, internal features such as the side-lighting of the sanctuary wall and indirect light along the apex of the parabolic ceiling have been lost. The church has been damaged by cyclones over the years. In January 1970 Cyclone Ada struck, causing flooding and damage to buildings in the Proserpine area. While carpets and cork tiles were badly damaged, there was no structural damage to the church, which was used as a temporary place of shelter for affected people. In 1977 St Paul's Church was consecrated when it became debt free. Later additions to the church include toilets, built against the back wall of the church, and a brick columbarium wall near the entrance, both added in 1995. A rectory, which stood behind the church, was sold and removed in early 2004, and a recent steel building has been constructed in its place. The original timber church has also been demolished. St Paul's continues to function as the main church for the Parish of Proserpine. Oribin's significant contribution to Queensland architecture was recognised by the Queensland Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 2000, when the new \\"Building of the Year\\" award for the Far North Region was named in his honour. In 2013, two of Oribin's other works, the first Oribin House and the Oribin Studio received the \\"Enduring Architecture Award\\" at the Australian Institute of Architects' Queensland Architecture Awards.  Description  St Paul's Anglican Church, a striking parabolic arched structure of concrete, brick, timber and glass, is located in Proserpine in the Whitsunday Region of northern Queensland. Orientated with its longitudinal axis north-south, the church is positioned at the front of a long rectangular block on the southern side of Main Street. The church is largely intact, retaining its original furniture and fittings. The most notable alterations have been to the roof, where original translucent sections have been replaced with opaque sheeting. The dominant element of the church's design is the parabolic arched roof over the nave and sanctuary. Clad in metal roof sheeting, the parabolic form is created by a reinforced concrete arch at the front, regularly spaced laminated timber arches throughout the interior and a brick end wall at the rear. A raised strip of roofing along the apex is clad in opaque sheeting. Single-storey brick side wings run along either side of the nave, featuring large windows and flat roofs clad in metal sheeting. Straddling the walls are reinforced concrete dished slabs, curving up and away from the top of the walls and overhanging by approximately one metre, acting as both guttering and eaves. The height of this slab indicates a datum level that extends within the church in the form of a flat ceiling over the aisles. The church is rectangular in plan with an entrance foyer in the north-west corner, linked to a brick and concrete bell tower by a covered walkway. The main elevation of the church is asymmetrical, with the end walls of the wings flanking the central arch being constructed of different materials. The concrete parabolic arch is in-filled with a timber framed glazed wall, with a reinforced concrete cross forming the central spine and a raised brick garden bed running along the base. A series of horizontal ridges on the outer edge of the parabolic arch are remnants of the original roof cladding system. To the side of the arch is the end wall of the eastern aisle, which features small, cross-shaped openings in the brickwork, in-filled with glass. A plaque commemorating the laying of the foundation stone is located here. The entrance foyer on the western side is fully glazed with timber framing and a low brick garden bed along the north side. The eastern elevation is straight, while along the western elevation the vestry and entry foyer project out beyond the aisle wall. Both elevations are divided into bays by regularly spaced brick piers, with brick infill up to waist height and windows above. The timber framed windows are made up of four awning casements separated by strips of frosted glass in the shape of a cross. The solid brick wall of the rear elevation is pierced by a high window in the form of a narrow cross. It has two layers of glazing, consisting of an inner layer of coloured glass segments and an outer layer of clear glass. Glazed doors provide access to the vestries. Adjacent to the western vestry door is a toilet block built up against the rear wall (this structure is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance). The bell tower is approximately high, surmounted by an aluminium cross. The tower is constructed from two parallel reinforced concrete walls with decorative brickwork on the outer faces. The two walls are linked by horizontal concrete beams and a bell is hung near the top. A rough render has been applied to the concrete surfaces, with a raised cross ornamenting to the top of each side. A low, rectangular, brick garden bed, originally a reflection pool, projects from the front of the tower. Interior, St Paul's Anglican Church, Proserpine, 2007 Entrance to the church is through the foyer at the north-west corner, through glazed doors on the western side. Aisles run along the eastern and western sides and through the centre of the nave. The sanctuary at the southern end is raised one step above the nave with vestries on either side. The timber pews, like most furniture in the church, have chambered corners painted an off-white colour. The collection plates are made from seven interlocking triangular pieces of timber. In the centre of the northern glazed wall is the baptismal font, standing on a small raised platform. It consists of a spun copper bowl set on a concrete column. The timber cover is a shallow, seven-sided pyramid, with an etched copper symbol of one of the seven sacraments attached to each face. An ANZAC shrine in the north-east corner has a bronze plaque attached to the centre of the wall, listing the names of fallen servicemen from the Proserpine district. Above this is a wooden sign bearing the words \\"Lest We Forget\\" and a small crucifix. A wooden rack supports flags attached to wooden poles. The rear sanctuary wall contains the glazed cross-shaped window, which has protruding metal fins attached on the interior. Below, the altar is located in the centre of a raised platform of three steps. The altar has a thick central base that inclines towards the top, clad in dark grey stones. A concrete cantilever angles out from the base to support the altar top, which is made from a terrazzo-like material incorporating pearl shell. Other items of furniture in the sanctuary include candlesticks, pulpit, lectern, and small stools and tables. The candlesticks are free-standing posts with a conical-shaped copper drip ring at the top. The timber pulpit has a protruding timber cross against a white background on the front face and sides that angle out towards the top, which has an angled book holder elevated on a tubular metal stand. The lectern is a simplified version of the pulpit but without the angled sides, and has an overhanging v-shaped top. A cupboard in the western wall of the sanctuary, the aumbry, has images of two saints on the inner face of the door leafs, made visible when opened. Walls of fixed vertical timber fins divide the sanctuary from the vestries on either side. The eastern vestry contains a small kitchenette and timber pantry cupboard. The western vestry contains built-in timber storage cupboards, a small safe and a corner sink. The lowered ceilings on either side of the nave give the appearance of floating, horizontal planes, the sides of which are lined with a timber fascia. These converge along the length of the church, towards the sanctuary wall. The undersides are clad in recent plasterboard sheeting, with regularly spaced, rectilinear openings along the inner edge, increasing in width as they approach the sanctuary. Along the top of both side walls the concrete dished slab extends into the church. Smaller in scale than on the exterior, the edges of the slab also curve upwards, pierced with regularly spaced square holes. The length of the church is divided into bays by the exposed parabolic arches. A scaled-down arch within the arch closest to the sanctuary provides the framework for a lower arched ceiling, lined with plasterboard. The gap between the inner and outer arches is glazed with frosted glass. The lower ceiling stops short of touching the southern sanctuary wall, allowing views of the main roof structure. Throughout the nave, the underside of the parabolic roof is lined with timber, while the tops of the parabolic arches are concealed from view by a high, plasterboard-clad cove. The church is fronted by a lawn area with recent garden beds along the footpath. A gravel driveway runs along the eastern side of the church and a concrete drive leads past the bell tower to the entrance. Behind the church is a recent steel building, while the remainder of the property is open lawn in 2013.  Heritage listing  St Paul's Anglican Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 October 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Paul's Anglican Church, Proserpine (1959) is important in demonstrating the evolution of church architecture in Queensland as a result of liturgical reform in the post-World War II period. Its design reflects the civic and spiritual ambitions of the Anglican community during a significant phase of constructing modern churches throughout the Diocese of North Queensland. The church is an outstanding example of the work of Cairns architect Edwin Henry (Eddie) Oribin, who produced a range of innovative and unique buildings in north Queensland between 1953 and 1973. Oribin's contribution to Queensland architecture is recognised by the Australian Institute of Architects' establishment of the Eddie Oribin Building of the Year Award for the Far North Queensland region. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. St Paul's Anglican Church is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of post- World War II church architecture, when architects experimented with a wide variety of church designs combining traditional elements, symbols and functions with new construction techniques, materials and forms. St Paul's possesses a traditional church plan expressed in a highly creative and non- traditional way. The creativity, craftsmanship and attention to detail evident in the church's design are characteristic of the works of architect Eddie Oribin, whose buildings are remarkable for their complex geometries, unconventional roof forms, innovative use of materials and structural systems, manipulation of natural light and ventilation, and custom designed, hand- crafted furniture. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. St Paul's Anglican Church is of aesthetic significance as a distinctive building of exceptional architectural quality, with its striking composition of strong, dynamic forms, including parabolic nave, horizontal entrance canopy and tall bell tower. The highly intact interior evokes the contemplative quality of traditional ecclesiastical volumes, elevating mind and spirit through symmetrically arranged contemporary forms, the manipulation of natural light and the skilful juxtaposition of contrasting shapes, materials, volumes and textures. The quality of the craftsmanship of complementary purpose-designed and built furniture, fittings and objects throughout the church is exceptional. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. St Paul's Anglican Church demonstrates a high degree of creative and technical achievement in Queensland for the period. A carefully crafted use of an unusual form, the parabolic arch, it was the first of Oribin's buildings to be constructed from arched glue laminated timber beams, an early use of the technology in Queensland.

It is estimated to lie at 900,000 light-years from the Earth, beyond the reaches of the Magellanic Clouds. Another star, ULAS J0744+25 was a bit closer. These stars are thought to be remnants of either the Milky Way's creation, or the merging of it with another small galaxy.  Discovery  Telescope pictures of both ULAS J00015+01 and ULAS J0744+25. They are in the middle of their respective pictures. ULAS J0015+01 was discovered on the 10th of July, 2014 with the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Both of these stars being cool red giants, they are extremely bright which is one of the key factors in their discovery. Their distance was estimated with a number of different techniques, which all pointed towards 900,000 light years away. Distance ULAS J0015+01 is, at the current time, 900,000 light years away from the Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way's disk is 180,000 light years in diameter, putting it far beyond the Milky Way stellar disk, or only 3 times closer than the Andromeda galaxy. In comparison, in distance to the Milky Way's satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, is only 160,000 light-years from Earth. ULAS J0015+01 and ULAS J0744+25 are not technically in a galaxy, but they are both classified as being in the Milky Way's outer halo, which stretches at least 500,000 light years away. These stars were both the first to be discovered beyond 200 kpc. Formation ULAS J0015+01 has been thought to either be a remnant of the Milky Way's formation or a merge with a different galaxy. Analysis of the surrounding environment does not favor the presence of a star within such a place of low density important for star formation. Another explanation was that this star was part of a population of stars that was stripped from their parent galaxy by the Milky Way. If it were originally part of the Milky Way, it would have been ejected at a high velocity of around 600 km/s. Another hypothesis was it is part of an unknown galaxy with low surface brightness, but that seems unlikely. No other stars have been discovered past ULAS J0015+01 or ULAS J0744+25, which almost completely gets rid of the unknown galaxy hypothesis.

It quotes from many early Chinese classics, and diversely includes subject matter from Chinese mythology, history, geography, and folklore. The Bowuzhi, which is one of the first works in the literary genre of zhiguai \\"tales of anomalies; supernatural stories\\", records the earliest versions of several myths, such as the white yen√º ÈáéÂ•≥ \\"wild women\\" living south of China in a society without men. Scholars have described the Bowuzhi as \\"a miscellany of scientific interest\\" (Needham et al. 1980: 309) and \\"an important minor classic\\" (Greatrex 1987: 158). Author The Bowuzhi author Zhang Hua (232-300) was a Western Jin dynasty (265-316) scholar, poet, and protoscientist. His biography in the (644) Book of Jin depicts Zhang Hua as a fangshi \\"master of esoterica\\" who was especially skilled at numerological arts, and a voracious collector of books, especially ones \\"strange, secret, and rarely seen\\" (Campany 1996: 51). Many anecdotes in Six Dynasties period books portray him as a \\"learned arbitrator of 'scientific' knowledge\\" (Greatrex 1987: 24). The (early 5th century) Yiyuan Áï∞Ëãë \\"Garden of Marvels\\", by Liu Jingshu ÂäâÊï¨Âèî, provides two examples. First, Zhang recognized dragon meat that was served by the author Lu Ji (261-303), who \\"once invited Zhang Hua to dinner and served minced fish. At the time the dining chamber was full of guests. When Hua lifted off the lid of the dish, he said, 'This is dragon's flesh!' None of the assembled guests believed him, so Hua said, 'Test it by steeping it in vinegar; something strange will happen.' When this was done a rainbow appeared above it.\\" (tr. Greatrex 1987: 21). In a second anecdote, Zhang Hua demonstrated the cosmological principle of ganying \\"sympathetic resonance\\". > During the Jin, there was a man who owned a large copper basin. Every > morning and evening it would ring out just as if someone was striking it. > When Zhang Hua was asked about this, he replied \\"This basin has a > sympathetic affinity with the bell in the Luoyang bell-tower. The bell is > struck every dawn and every dusk, and thus this basin resounds in sympathy. > You could file away [a part of the basin] and thus make it lighter; the > sound would reverberate inaccurately and the basin would cease ringing out > of its own accord.\\" The man did as Hua had advised, and the basin never rang > out again. (tr. Greatrex 1987: 20) The Ganying leicongzhi ÊÑüÊáâÈ°ûÂæûÂøó \\"Record of the Mutual Resonances of Things According to Their Categories\\" is attributed to Zhang Hua (Greatrex 1987: 26). Title The Bowuzhi title combines b√≥ Âçö or ÊÑΩ \\"broad; abundant; plentiful; learned\\", w√π Áâ© \\"thing; matter\\", and zh√¨ Âøó or Ë™å \\"(historical) records; annals; mark; sign; record; register\\". This title follows Yang Fu's (early 3rd century) Yiwuzhi Áï∞Áâ©Âøó \\"Records of Foreign Matters\\". The word bowu ÂçöÁâ© originally meant \\"broadly knowledgeable; erudite\\" in the (c. 4th century BCE) Zuozhuan and later came to mean \\"studies of plants and animals; natural science\\" in the (80 CE) Lunheng. In general, bowu \\"refers to realms transgressing the boundaries of the defined canon of knowledge, covering a variety of matters from the strange and supernatural to quaint things of interest\\" (Dole≈æelov√°- Velingerov√° and Wagner 2013: 64). Books on Chinese folk customs and their geographical distribution were termed Fengtu ji (beginning with Zhou Chu's 3rd-century Fengtuji È¢®ÂúüË®ò \\"Records of Local Customs\\"), and descriptions of unfamiliar regions Yiwu zhi (Needham and Ling 1959: 510). In Modern Standard Chinese usage, b√≥w√πxu√© ÂçöÁâ©Â≠∏ \\"natural history\\" and b√≥w√πgu«én ÂçöÁâ©È§® \\"museum\\" are common terms. There is no regular English translation of B√≥w√πzh√¨, and examples include: *Record of the Investigation of Things (Needham and Wang 1954: 258) *A Treatise on Manifold Topics (Greatrex 1987: 1) *Treatise on Curiosities (Campany 1996: 334) *Vast Records about Different Topics (Ulrich 2010) *Natural Science (Wong et al. 2012: 129) *Miscellaneous Records (Dole≈æelov√°- Velingerov√° and Wagner 2013: 64) *Record of Things at Large (Shaughnessy 2014: 143) *Records of Myriad [Notable] Things (Zhang 2015: 113) The Record of the Investigation of Things translation from Joseph Needham's influential Science and Civilisation in China series has been copied by many authors (e.g., Selin 1997: 811), despite confusion with the famous Neo-Confucian concept of g√©w√π Ê†ºÁâ© \\"the Investigation of Things\\". Zhang Hua has been accused of plagiarizing the Bowuzhi from the similarly-titled (c. 190) Bowuji ÂçöÁâ©Ë®ò \\"Notes on Diverse Matters\\" with j√¨ Ë®ò \\"remember; write down; records; notes\\" (instead of zhi Âøó \\"records\\"), attributed to Tang Meng ÂîêËíô (Needham and Wang 1959: 608). Tang Meng was a general and explorer who Emperor Wu of Han sent to Nanyue in 135 BCE. However, neither the Book of Han nor later histories record any works written by Tang Meng, and one Bowuji citation mentions the Cao Wei dynasty (220-265) by name. Based upon analysis of the 50 Bowuji quotes in the (5th century) Book of the Later Han commentary, Greatrex (1987: 64-66) concludes it was a different text with a parallel name. Editions There are two different editions of the Bowuzhi, respectively dating from Song dynasty (960-1279) and Ming dynasty (1368-1644) copies. Both divide the text into 10 chapters (Âç∑) and comprise nearly the same material, but they differ in organizing the sequence of the 329 items and the presence of 38 topic headings in the Ming copy (Campany 1996: 50). Both editions include the two early Bowuzhi commentaries; 20 comments by Zhou Riyong Âë®Êó•Áî® (fl. 12th century) and 7 by an unknown author surnamed Lu, Lushi ÁõßÊ∞è (Greatrex 1987: 45). The \\"Song edition\\" was compiled and published in 1804 by Huang Pilie ÈªÉ‰∏ïÁÉà (1763-1825), a renowned Qing dynasty (1644-1912) book collector and editor. Huang said the edition was based on a copy owned in his family, and considered it to date from the Northern Song dynasty (960‚Äì1127). The Song edition was included in collections such as the (1936) Sibu beiyao ÂõõÈÉ®ÂÇôË¶Å. The \\"Ming edition\\" was published in 1503 by He Zhitong Ë≥ÄÂøóÂêå, and is presently housed in the National Library of China in Beijing. Wang ShihanÊ±™Â£´Êº¢ published a reprint in 1668. The Ming edition, which is the earliest extant, was included in the (1782) Siku Quanshu and various other book collections (Greatrex 1987: 27-29). The total content matter of these two versions is almost identical; the Song edition repeats three items in chapter 10 which have appeared earlier in the text, while the Ming edition has omitted them. Both editions are divided into 10 chapters, while the Ming edition is further sub-divided under 38 or 39 (dividing the final Zashuo ÈõúË™™ \\"Miscellaneous sayings\\" into two) headings that designate the content in each respective subsection. Campany (1996: 50-51) says the absence of topic headings and non-rational sequencing of items have led some to speculate that the \\"Ming edition\\" represents a tidying-up of an earlier \\"Song edition\\" descended from Zhang Hua's original, but Huang Pilie's text was neither necessarily of Song date nor any closer to Zhang's text. It is well established that some Ming scholars responded to a misguided scholastic urge to rearrange old texts that they considered disorganized, and the \\"stylistic device\\" of adding sub-headings to works of random jottings first became widespread during the Ming (Greatrex 1987: 30). Three authors wrote supplements to the Bowuzhi (Greatrex 1987: 26). During the Southern Song dynasty, Li Shi ÊùéÁü≥ compiled the (mid-12th century) Xu bowuzhi Á∫åÂçöÁâ©Âøó \\"Continuation to the Bowuzhi\\" in 10 chapters, which quotes early sources without any textual criticism. During the Ming dynasty, Dong Sizhang Ëë£ÊñØÂºµ compiled the extensive (1607) Guang Bowuzhi Âª£ÂçöÁâ©Âøó \\"Enlargement of the Bowuzhi\\" in 50 chapters. And during the Qing dynasty, You Qian Ê∏∏ÊΩõ compiled the Bowuzhi bu ÂçöÁâ©ÂøóË£ú \\"Supplement to the Bowuzhi\\" in 2 chapters, which added miscellaneous information. Several modern annotated editions of the Bowuzhi have been published in recent years. Fan Ning ËåÉÂØß (1980) wrote an acclaimed text-critical edition of the Bowuzhi, which discusses textual history and includes 212 additional passages quoted in later texts. Roger Greatrex, professor of Chinese studies at Lund University, wrote the first English translation (1987) of the Bowuzhi. History Scholars have debated over the history of the Bowuzhi for centuries. Although Zhang Hua's authorship has never been questioned, many doubt the authenticity of the text, based upon the numerous quotations from the Bowuzhi that are not found in received editions. In the traditional consensus, Zhang's original Bowuzhi had been lost, and the current text is a rewriting or restoration of unknown date. Modern research, both Chinese and Western, has found that copies of the original Bowuzhi existed until around the 12th century, and was the basis for both the \\"Song\\" and \\"Ming editions.\\" Greatrex (1987: 38) says that both imperial and private libraries from the Six Dynasties to the present recorded copies of the Bowuzhi, and at no point in time does the text totally disappear from view. The first historically reliable mention of the Bowuzhi occurs in the (554) Book of Wei biography (tr. Greatrex 1987: 32) of the classical scholar Chang Jing Â∏∏ÊôØ (c. 478-550), \\"Jing composed several hundred chapters which are currently available. He revised and edited the Bowu zhi by Zhang Hua and also composed the Biographies of Confucian Scholars (Rulin zhuan) and the Biographies of Various Ladies (Lienu zhuan), each of which was in several dozen chapters.\\" In the opinion of Greatrex (1987: 68), while later interpolations into the present Bowuzhi text are rare, a number of short passages, muddled into the main text, stem from Chang Jing's (mid-6th century) commentary. A possibly earlier reference, Wang Jia's Shiyiji ‚Äî which was written in the 4th century, lost, and recompiled by Xiao Qi in the 6th century ‚Äî says Emperor Wu of Jin (r. 266-290) ordered Zhang Hua to condense the Bowuzhi from 400 to 10 chapters. > Zhang Hua liked to peruse mysterious and strange charts and Apocryphal > works, and from them he selected odd long-lost tales from the four corners > of the world, from the very beginning of the written character. When he had > examined these mysterious and strange (works) and added to them the hearsay > rumoured abroad and snatches of conversation overheard in the palace ante- > rooms, he composed the Bowu zhi in four hundred chapters, and presented to > emperor Wu. The emperor summoned him and said: \\"Your talent embraces the ten > thousand generations and the width of your knowledge is without equal. In > the past you surpass the Emperor Fuxi and more recently, you are second only > to Confucius. However, in your recording of affairs and in your selection of > words, there is much that is superficial and exaggerated which should be > deleted from this work. One should not rely upon verbosity when composing a > work! When in the past, Confucius edited the Shijing and the Shujing, he > never came to the affairs of the spirits and the unknown and thus never > spoke of 'extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder and spiritual > beings'. Your Bowu zhi will startle people with that which they have never > heard of previously, and will make them wonder over that which they have > never previously seen. This book will frighten and confuse later > generations, it will bewilder the eye and disturb the ear. You should delete > and alter that which is superficial and doubtful and divide the text into 10 > chapters.\\" (tr. Greatrex 1987: 49-50) The context continues with Emperor Wu presenting Zhang Hua with three rare tribute gifts, an iron inkstone from Khotan, a qilin-handle ink brush from Liaoxi, and a 1000 sheets of seaweed-filament paper from Nanyue; and \\"The emperor always kept the ten-chapter version of the Bowu zhi in his book-box and looked in it on his days of leisure.\\" C√®l«êzh«ê ÂÅ¥ÁêÜÁ¥ô \\"intricate filament paper\\" had complex and crooked lines (Needham and Tsien 1985: 62-63). The editors of the (1782) Siku Quanshu listed examples of passages attributed to the Bowuzhi found in other works, but not contained in the current edition, and believed that the current textual edition did not date from the Tang or Song, but was most likely a Ming recension. They conclude (tr. Greatrex 1987:53-54), \\"It is a scissors-and-paste scrap-book of a work, and is not Hua's original work\\", and suggest \\"Probably the original work is lost, and meddlers having scoured all the works that quote the Bowu zhi, have compiled the present text, supplementing it with passages drawn from other Xiaoshuo [fiction].\\" The missionary sinologist Alexander Wylie summarized the standard Qing dynasty scholarly opinion of the Bowuzhi. > The Po wuh che was originally drawn up by Chang Hwa, in the latter part of > the third century. His production, however, appears to have been lost during > the Sung, and the present work in ten books with that title, was probably > compiled at a later period from the extracts contained in other > publications; but there are still many quotations from it in the ancient > literature which do not appear in the present edition. It is in great part > occupied with records of the marvellous. (1867: 192) Fan Ning (1980: 157-162, cited by Campany 1996: 50) traced the \\"Ming edition\\" version back to Chang Jing's (6th century) 10-chapter abridgment (mentioned above), which seems to have survived alongside Zhang Hua's longer 10-chapter autograph text until at least until the late twelfth century. The fate of the unabridged original text remains a mystery. There is a possibility that the original Bowuzhi copy that was the basis for the Song edition dated from the early 7th century. Greatrex (1987: 61-62) suggests that some graphic alterations in the text reflect the strict naming taboo against writing the current emperor's given name. The personal name of Emperor Gaozu of Tang (r. 618-626) was Yuan Ê∑µ, and in one context the character yuan Ê∑µ has been altered to quan Ê≥â. The personal name of Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 627-650) was Shimin ‰∏ñÊ∞ë, and in two contexts ye Ëëâ has been altered to the character qi Ëêã, and in another the character xie Ê≥Ñ has been altered to xie Ê¥©. Example entries In order to illustrate the diverse content of the Bowuzhi, some notable mythic and scientific passages are given below. Some items blur the lines between fact and fiction. For instance, the legend about \\"Wild Women\\" in Vietnam has been interpreted as an early observation of orangutans that was exaggerated into a tall tale. =Ethnographic legends= The Bowuzhi contains the earliest reference to the mythical yƒõn«ö ÈáéÂ•≥ \\"Wild Women\\" of Rinan (present- day central Vietnam), naked, white-skinned women in an exclusively female society. The item says (9, tr. Greatrex 1987: 135-136), \\"In Annam there are 'wild women', which travel about in groups in search of men for husbands. Their appearance is dazzlingly white, and they go naked, without any clothing at all.\\" Later texts quoted and misquoted Zhang Hua's \\"Wild Women\\" item, and elaborated the narrative. The Qidong yeyu ÈΩäÊù±ÈáéË™û \\"Words of a Retired Scholar from the East of Qi\\", written by Zhou Mi Âë®ÂØÜ (1232-1298), has a yƒõp√≥ ÈáéÂ©Ü \\"Wild Woman\\" entry, with p√≥ \\"woman; old woman; grandmother\\". > Yepo (meaning \\"wild woman\\") is found in Nandanzhou. It has yellow hair > shaped into coils. It is naked and wears no shoes. It looks like a very old > woman. All of them are female and there are no male ones. They climb up and > down the mountain as fast as golden monkeys. Under their waists are pieces > of leather covering their bodies. When they encounter a man, they will carry > him away and force him to mate. It is reported once that such a creature was > killed by a strong man. It protected its waist even when it was being > killed. After dissecting the animal, a piece of seal chip was found that was > similar to a piece of gray jade with inscriptions on it. (tr. Luo 2003: > 4128) Li Shizhen's (1578) Bencao gangmu pharmacopeia quotes the \\"Wild Women\\" under the xingxing ÁãåÁãå \\"orangutan\\" entry (51, tr. Luo 2003: 4128), and cites the Eryayi ÁàæÈõÖÁøº \\"Wings to the Erya\\" by Luo Yuan ÁæÖÈ°ò (1136‚Äì1184) that, \\"'It seems such a creature is actually a Yen√º (meaning \\"wild girl\\") or Yepo (meaning \\"wild woman\\")'\\", and Li asks, \\"Are they the same?\\" The subentry for the yen√º ÈáéÂ•≥ or yƒõp√≥ ÈáéÂ©Ü (tr. Luo 2003: 4128, cf. Read 1931: no. 403A) quotes, \\"The book Bowu Zhi by Tang Meng [sic]: In the Rinan area there is a kind of creature called the Yen√º (meaning \\"wild girl\\") that travels in group. No male ones are to be found. They are white and crystal-like, wearing no clothes.\\" It also quotes Zhou Mi's Qidong yeyu (above), and Li comments: \\"According to what Ruan Qian and Luo Yuan said above, it seems that this Yen√º is actually an orangutan. As to the seal chip found in the animal, it is similar to the case that the testes of a male mouse are said to have seal characters [fuzhuan Á¨¶ÁØÜ \\"symbolic seal script\\"] on them, and the case that under the wing of a bird a seal of mirror has been found. Such things are still unclear to us.\\" Two Song dynasty imperial reference works quote the Zhang Hua's \\"Wild Women\\" in their B√°im√≠n gu√≥ ÁôΩÊ∞ëÂúã \\"Country of White Folk\\" entries that refer to two Shanhaijing myths about white-skinned people. The (983) Taiping Yulan encyclopedia quotes the Bowuzhi and two Shanhaijing chapters. In the west (tr. Birrell 2000: 117), \\"The Country of White Folk lies to the north of the land of Dragonfish. The people of White Folk Country have a white body and they wear their hair loose.\\" In the east (tr. Birrell 2000: 160), \\"There is the Country of White Folk. The great god Foremost [‰øä] gave birth to the great god Vast [È¥ª]. The great god Vast gave birth to the White Folk.\\", giving a divine genealogical origin myth. The (978) Taiping Guangji collection misquotes the Bowuzhi for the above Shanhaijing myth (tr. Birrell 2000: 117), \\"In that place there are the ride-yellow creatures which look like a fox and have horns on their backs. People who ride them will live to be 2,000 years old.\\" The Bowuzhi mentions various poisons and antidotes, including an arrowhead poison used by the Lizi ‰øöÂ≠ê people in Jiaozhou (present day northern Vietnam), later confused with the Li people of Hainan. > In Jiaozhou, there are barbarians called the Lizi. Their bows are several > chi long, and their arrows are more than a chi long. They use scorched > bronze [jiƒÅot√≥ng ÁÑ¶ÈäÖ] as arrowheads, and smear them with poisonous > medicaments on the tip. If such an arrow hits a man, he will die within a > short while. Once the tip has lodged in his body, the affected area swells, > and the wound suppurates. After a short while the flesh blisters and 'boils > away', revealing the bone. In accord with the barbarian custom, they have > sworn not to divulge the method for preparing this medicament to other > people. To cure it, drink menstrual blood mixed with excremental fluid. > Sometimes there are those who recover. The Lizi only use this poison when > shooting pigs and dogs, but not other creatures, since pigs and dogs eat > excrement. In the making of scorched bronze, one burns bronze vessels. Those > who are adepts at it differentiate the potentiality of the scorched bronze > by its sound. They use something to tap the vessel, and listen carefully to > the sound. Once they have obtained the scorched bronze, then they chisel it > out and use it to make arrowheads. (tr. Greatrex 1987: 138) Cooper and Sivin (1973: 237) quote this Bowuzhi item and note that \\"excremental fluid\\" is the liquid that gradually forms in an open privy. The Bowuzhi records a legendary wind-propelled flying machine, as opposed to numerous early myths of flying vehicles drawn by dragons or birds. The story mentions Tang (r. c. 1675‚Äì1646 BC), the first king of the Shang dynasty, meeting the Jigong Â•áËÇ± (lit. \\"odd/uneven upper-arms\\") people from far west of the Jade Gate. > The Jigong people were good at making mechanical devices [Ê©üÂ∑ß] for killing > the hundred sorts of birds. They could make a flying carriage [È£õËªä] which > travelling with the wind, travelled great distances. In the reign of emperor > Tang, a westerly wind blew such a carriage as far as Yuzhou. Tang had the > carriage taken to pieces, for he did not wish to show it to his people. Ten > years later there came an easterly wind [of sufficient strength], and then > the carriage was reassembled and the visitors were sent back to their own > country. Their country lies forty thousand li beyond the Jade Gate pass. (8, > tr. Greatrex 1987: 131) An earlier version of this story occurs in the Diwang shiji Â∏ùÁéã‰∏ñÁ¥Ä \\"Stories of Ancient Monarchs\\" by Huangfu Mi (215-282), who took Jigong to be a person rather than a people. The Shanhaijing (tr. Birrell: 1999: 115) also mentions the Jigong \\"Country of Singlearm\\", whose people \\"have one arm and three eyes\\" and \\"ride on piebald horses\\", without any reference to flying vehicles. =Protoscientific observations= Bowuzhi Chapter 6 has two consecutive items describing highly potent liquors, possibly the first references to \\"freeze distillation\\" or technically fractional freezing (Needham et al. 1980: 151). This technique for concentrating alcohol involves repeatedly freezing wine or beer and removing the ice (for instance, applejack or ice beer, but not ice wine made from frozen grapes). The earliest Chinese record is traditionally believed to be the (late 7th century) Liang Sigong ji Ê¢ÅÂõõÂÖ¨Ë®ò \\"Tales of the Four Lords of Liang\\", which says emissaries from Gaochang presented d√≤ngji«î ÂáçÈÖí \\"frozen-out wine\\" to Emperor Wu of Liang around 520. The first item refers to qiƒÅnr√¨ji«î ÂçÉÊó•ÈÖí \\"thousand day wine\\". > Long ago Xuanshi [ÁéÑÁü≥] bought wine in a wine-house in Zhongshan, and the > wineshop owner gave him thousand-day wine but forgot to tell him its > alcoholic potency. Xuanshi went home and became drunk, but his housefolk did > not realise this and thought that he was dead, and tearfully buried him. > When the wine-shop owner had calculated that the thousand days were up, he > recalled that Xuanshi had previously bought some of his wine, and that his > stupour should have worn off by now. He went to visit Xuanshi, but was told > that he had died three years previously and was already buried. Thereafter > they opened the coffin and [indeed] he had just sobered up. A common saying > arose, \\"Xuanshi had a drink, and stayed drunk a thousand days\\". (6, tr. > Greatrex 1987: 110) The second refers to a non-Chinese p√∫t√°oji«î Ëë°ËêÑÈÖí (6, tr. Greatrex 1987: 110-111, cf. Needham et al. 1980: 151), \\"In the western regions there is a grape wine which can be stored for many years without going bad. There is a common saying which goes, \\"One can drink it after ten years, and stay drunk a full month before its effect wears off!\\" This clearly describes liquor and not ordinary wine, and was the earliest known Chinese reference to \\"frozen-out wine\\" (Needham et al. 1980: 151). \\"'Frozen-out wine' then, in all its primitive simplicity, was, we would suggest, an important step on the road from beer or wine as such to distilled 'strong liquor'.\\" (Needham et al. 1980: 155). Furthermore, Wang Jia's (c. 370) Shiyi ji says Zhang Hua made lethal ji«îy√πn ch≈´nji«î ‰πùÈÜûÊò•ÈÖí \\"nine fermented spring wine\\" or xiƒÅoch√°ngji«î ÈÖíËÖ∏Ê∂à \\"gut- rotting wine\\" using a special ferment and grain he obtained from the Five Barbarians. This wine \\"causes chattering of the teeth and apparent drunkenness without shouting or laughter, injuring the liver and intestines\\" (Needham et al. 1980: 152). > When Zhang Hua had attained high office, one of his companions from his > childhood came to pay a visit upon him. Hua and his childhood friend drank > Nine-fold fermented wine, and caroused with a will. In the evening they both > became quite drunk and fell asleep. Hua was accustomed to drinking this > wine, and after becoming inebriated, he had his attendants roll him from > side to side while he slept until he woke up. In this way one could consume > this wine without coming to harm. However on this occasion, he forgot [to > make arrangements for his friend]. Hua's attendants, as usual, rolled him > from side to side, but there was no-one who did this to his friend. The > following morning, when his friend did not arise, Hua groaned and said, \\"He > must be dead!\\" and sent someone to see. The wine had indeed oozed out from > the man's intestines and had trickled down onto the floor beneath the bed. > (tr. Greatrex 1987: 23) Zhang Hua describes spontaneous combustion of oil (3, tr. Greatrex 1987: 98), \\"If one stores a full ten thousand shi of oil, it will ignite by itself. \\" Taishi Ê≥∞Âßã was the first era name during the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin (265-290). However, the Book of Jin says this military storehouse fire occurred in 295 and the Yiyuan Áï∞Ëãë \\"Garden of Marvels\\" says 293, during the reign of Emperor Hui of Jin (Greatrex 1987: 219). Needham doubts the Bowuzhi account, citing a legal case in the (13th century) Tangyin bishi Â†ÇÈô∞ÊØî‰∫ã about responsibility for a (c. 1015) fire that started from a pile of oiled curtains in the imperial palace of Emperor Renzong of Song. It says (tr. Needham 1962: 66-67), \\"[Z]hang Hua thought that the fire which occurred formerly during the (Western) [J]in dynasty in the arsenal originated from the oil which was stored there, but in fact it must have been from the same cause as mentioned here (the spontaneous ignition of oiled cloth).\\" Another Bowuzhi chapter describes hemp oil's relatively low smoke point and boiling point phases (2, tr. Greatrex 1987: 85), \\"If one heats hemp oil, and the steam has ceased and there is no smoke, then it does not boil anymore and becomes cold again. One can put one's hand into it and stir it. However, if it comes into contact with water, flames arise and it explodes, and cannot be extinguished at all.\\" In Joseph Needham's (1962: 68) opinion, \\"These observations are not bad. In the first phase all the water has been driven off as steam and the boiling-point of the oil not yet reached. If sufficiently wetted the finger would not come into contact with the oil, protection being given by a layer of steam. Then when the oil is near its boiling-point, added water will cause violent disturbance and lead to the ignition of drops thrown out.\\" One Bowuzhi item describes making a burning lens from ice (2, tr. Greatrex 1987: 86), \\"If one pares a piece of ice into a circle, and holds it up in the direction of the sun, and produces the sun's image on artemisia behind it, the artemisia will catch fire. \\" Another translation, \\"A piece of ice is cut into the shape of a round ball\\" (Needham and Wang 1962: 113), takes yu√°n Âúì \\"round; circle\\" to mean yu√°nqi√∫ ÂúìÁêÉ \\"ball; sphere; globe\\". The hu«ízh≈´ ÁÅ´Áè† \\"fire-pearl\\" burning lens is mentioned in the Bencao gangmu along with the y√°ngsu√¨ ÈôΩÁáß \\"sun-mirror\\". Needham and Wang (1962: 114) note that although ice can be used in this way (as demonstrated by Robert Hooke), it seems more likely that Zhang Hua was describing a lens of rock-crystal or glass. The word crystal derives from Ancient Greek kr√Ωstallos Œ∫œÅœçœÉœÑŒ±ŒªŒªŒøœÇ \\"clear ice; (rock-)crystal\\", and \\"there was a persistent theory in China, probably of Buddhist origin, that ice turned into rock-crystal after thousands of years.\\" See also *Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms *Jizhong discovery *Zhang Hua References *Birrell, Anne, tr. 2000.

Parish church del Carmen is the only remain that survives from the old convent. The Convento del Carmen Calzado (English for Convent of the Calced Carmel) was a convent in the Order of Mount Carmel . It was located in the area currently occupied by the Plaza del Carmen in Madrid.Virginia Tovar Martin (2000), Brief History of the Baroque architecture of the Community of Madrid, General Directorate of the Historical and Artistic Heritage, , p. 79-81 This convent was founded in 1573. The Spanish confiscation during late-19th century left only the Parish church del Carmen and the ensanche (widening) of the area of Plaza del Carmen (which takes its name from this convent). One of the ten streets leading to the Puerta del Sol, and passing next to the facade of the parish church, is called Calle del Carmen. The site of the convent was dedicated to the Front√≥n Central, which would become the Cine Madrid.  History  In 1541, a Madrilenian brothel owned by Mar√≠a de Peralta and Francisco Jim√©nez was evicted and demolished by King Philip II. On the site rose the Convento del Carmen Calzado. The convent was founded in 1575 with the patronage of the king and his sister Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal. Author Ram√≥n de Mesonero Romanos alludes in 1831 to its creation in his Manual de Madrid: Initially, the convent was under the patronage of Saint Damasus who was popularly called Carmen Calzado by the Order. The inaugural mass was conducted by Papal Nuncio Juan Bautista Castaneo, later (1590) Pope Urban VII. The proximity of the convent to the Puerta del Sol, increased its popularity, sharing the limelight with the Convento de San Felipe el Real. Between 1611 and 1640 the building was renovated by architect Miguel de Soria. In 1836, the convent was confiscated. Its inhabitants secularized and the church survived as Parish church Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen y San Luis.

Career Vannah tried her hand at journalism, writing for the Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia papers, and for several Maine papers, under the name of Kate Van Twinkle. Her poetry was superior, and was widely copied. In 1892, a book of her poems, \\"Verses\\", was published by J. B.

It was built from the 1860s onward. It is also known as Strathmore Station. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 November 2008.  History  Strathmore Homestead is located on the north side of Strathmore Road at Springlands, about by road north-west of Collinsville. First established in the early 1860s Strathmore Homestead has evolved to comprise a large number of buildings, structures and yards constructed from possibly the earliest establishment of the site through the nineteenth century to the latter part of the twentieth century. Structures include a slab hut (currently used to accommodate the kitchen and dining room for station personnel), main homestead, laundry, office, stables, meathouses, swimming pool complex, various cottages, homestead gardens, former school, former zoo, sheds, weir and a private cemetery. Strathmore was leased in 1862 by PF Selheim who was connected in partnership with CW Touissant until September 1865 when new lease claimants were William Tucker and William Duncan Stewart. Tucker was still at Strathmore in 1870. In 1872 Leopold De Salis leased Strathbogie which was to form part of what was consolidated into Strathmore in 1885. De Salis had leased Strathmore by 1875 in partnership with A Macdonald. This began a business partnership that was to continue until 1890 when the Union Bank of Australia acquired the lease. De Salis was a pastoralist and politician and began acquiring properties in New South Wales in the mid-1840s. In 1885 De Salis petitioned to consolidate a number of runs into Strathmore. However the consolidation did not occur until 1890 when De Salis, with his brother Henry, re-applied for a consolidation. In July 1890 the Strathmore runs included Strathmore, East Downs, Binjee, Mullar, Dirrill, Tullick, Glenking, West Downs, Mount Wickham, Harvest Home, Boundary, Strathbogie and Wengeur. These were divided between the settled and unsettled districts within the North Kennedy Pastoral District. By October of the same year the De Salis brothers and Henry Fane De Salis transferred the Strathmore brand to the Union Bank of Australia. With debts of over ¬£100 000, Leopold De Salis returned to New South Wales and was declared insolvent in 1898. The Union Bank held the lease to Strathmore for a number of years with managers on the property. The year 1902 saw the beginning of a partnership between William Oswald Gilchrist, William Holden Watt with Arthur Henry Wickham Cunningham. This partnership was the beginning of an association of the Cunningham family with Strathmore that exists to the present day. William Oswald Gilchrist was the eldest son of John Gilchrist, a Scottish merchant, and his wife Isabella n√©e Wilson. William Holden Watt was the son of Ernest Alexander Watt and his wife, Mary Jane n√©e Holden. Gilchrist followed his father, John Gilchrist, in the family firm of Gilchrist Watt and Sanderson Ltd. The firm tended not to invest directly in land but rather in advancing money to graziers, who in turn, bought their stores and had wool shipped through the firm. William Watt's father, Ernest, was a director of Gilchrist Watt and Sanderson Ltd. Ernest Watt did have an interest in the acquisition of pastoral properties and, besides Strathmore, his other cattle stations in Queensland included Glenprairie, outside of Rockhampton. The Cunningham family is one of the oldest pastoral families in North Queensland. In April 1861 Edward Cunningham, father of AHW Cunningham, left Port Denison with four other men to explore the country west of Bowen in search of good pastoral runs. Cunningham took up Burdekin Downs, an area of 140,000 acres (56 656 hectares). He did not reside on the property, living at Woodhouse Station, outside Ayr, until his death in 1898. AHW Cunningham was born in June 1879 and spent most of his life in North Queensland. At the age of 19, following his father's death, he took over the management of Woodhouse for Gilchrist Watt and Cunningham. In 1902, following a devastating season for Woodhouse when 85 percent of the herd was lost, AHW Cunningham set about acquiring new land for re-stocking purposes. On his recommendation Gilchrist Watt and Cunningham purchased the lease for Strathmore Station at a cost of ¬£50,000. Cunningham took up residence on Strathmore where the family has remained since. A list of improvements dated 1906 values the main house at ¬£1,000. One secondary source states that the homestead was constructed in 1903. This date is possible as the architectural style, including its ornamentation along the roof ridge, timber louvred gablets decorated with diagonal battens and the gabled pediment detailing on the south elevation marking the front entrance, indicate a late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century construction date. The year 1903 is also the year after the start of the Gilchrist, Watt and Cunningham partnership and the construction of a suitable residence may have been a priority for AHW Cunningham. Cunningham married Nellie Maud Wharton in May 1910 and the marriage produced four children: a daughter and three sons, one of whom was Edward Snr, born in 1914 and father of the present lessee, Edward Thomas Cunningham. The 1906 list of improvements indicates that two kitchens existed on the property and the slab hut, for which a definite construction date has not been determined, may have been one of the kitchens. It is now used as staff sleeping quarters and storage with a later addition containing a dining room and kitchen. It is of slab construction and has a steeply pitched gabled roof over an original one- room-wide core, suggesting it may date from the mid-nineteenth century. Oral histories date the building as . Other structures listed by July 1906 were shed and saddle room, stable and yards, men's hut, cottage, store and office, beef house, kitchen, kitchen no.2, blacksmith's shop, stockyards, of fencing, four wells and troughs. Stockyards and horse yards were also listed at Mount Wickham, one of the Strathmore paddocks at the time. The blacksmith shop may have been demolished as there is no building on the property which, through its form or fabric, suggests a blacksmithing use. Further construction on the site since 1906 includes two more meat houses, another cottage and a swimming pool. The 1906 list provides a good indication of how the head station on a large pastoral property functioned at this period. On behalf of the partnership, AHW Cunningham controlled three properties: Strathmore (with its outstations of Strathbogie, Strathalbyn, Hidden Valley and Castleview), Woodhouse and Glenprairie. The combined area of these properties was with over 50,000 head of cattle. AHW Cunningham was a member of the Queensland Turf Club, the Civic Club at Charters Towers, and the North Queensland and Tattersalls Club, Townsville. In the early years he established a thoroughbred stud and the Strathmore colours of green and orange were a regular sight at North Queensland race meetings. Cunningham was a foundation member of the North Queensland Amateur Turf Club in 1910. He succeeded the late JHS Barnes as president in 1912 and held the position until his death. He was also a committee member of the North Queensland Racing Association for many years. Cunningham was keenly interested and involved in public and pastoral matters in the Bowen district. He was a member of the Wangaratta Shire Council for 39 years from August 1903, serving as councillor until he was elected chairman in February 1916, a position he held until his death on 8 January 1942. At the outbreak of World War I he had volunteered his services and, like a number of other pastoralists, was rejected on the grounds that he was working in an essential occupation. Cunningham's son, Edward, started work on Strathmore following his schooling in Sydney. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he and his two brothers John and Henry enlisted in Townsville. Edward was recalled to assist with the management of Strathmore a short time later when his father fell ill and was discharged from the services as he worked in an essential occupation. Like his father, Edward Cunningham devoted a portion of his time to public affairs. He was chairman of the Bowen Shire Council from 1960-1966 and was on the board of directors for the Collinsville Coal Company. He was a member of the Queensland Cattleman's Association, founder of the Poll Devon Breed of cattle in Australia, founder of the Queensland Branch of the Devon Breeders Society in 1968 and its president until his retirement in 1985. On 1 July 1959 a 53-year lease commenced on Strathmore that expires on 30 June 2012. This lease was transferred to Edward Cunningham, his brother Henry Keith Cunningham and his sister, Nellie Macmillan, wife of Murdoch Campbell Macmillan, on 15 July 1965. On 21 December 1993 Edward Cunningham was killed tragically. The lease was transferred to his son Edward Thomas Cunningham on 10 April 1996 and the Cunningham family connection with Strathmore continues. Three members of the Cunningham family are buried near the main complex in a private cemetery: * Edward Cunningham (2 December 1914 - 21 December 1993) * Margaret Cunningham (10 March 1945 - 21 April 1945, daughter of Edward Cunningham) * Wyatt Cunningham (19 November 1995 - 20 February 1999, son of Edward Thomas Cunningham).  Description  Strathmore Homestead is located on a 41,000 hectare land lease on Strathmore Road at Springlands, about by road north-west of Collinsville. The complex, situated to the north of Strathmore Road, comprises a homestead, laundry, slab hut (used to accommodate the kitchen and dining room for station personnel), office, stables, meat houses, swimming pool complex, various cottages, homestead gardens, sheds, former school, former zoo, weir and private cemetery. = Main residence = The main Strathmore residence is situated on a rocky rise adjacent to and south of Crush Creek. It is a large house of single-skin exposed timber-framed construction with wide verandahs on three sides and is elevated above its sloping site on a combination of timber stumps and steel posts. Attached on its western elevation is a hip-roofed, single-skin timber cottage, which houses the kitchen and utility rooms. The large hipped corrugated galvanised iron roof is a feature of the homestead. It has ogee guttering and acroteria and is encircled by a veranda roof with quad guttering and acroteria. The ridge is defined by finials and diagonally battened, louvred gablets. At the southern end of the house, transverse roof vents with louvred projecting gables are decorated with finials and cresting. The gable on the southern elevation over the entrance contains a louvred vent. The main entrance to the homestead is off the avenue lined with phoenix palms (Phoenix canariensis) and is accessed via a set of concrete stairs with decorative pillars to the timber stairway with handrail, and a trellis with trailing vines straddling the stairs. Additional entrances are located on the east and west sides. A verandah encircles three sides of the building and is enclosed with matchstick timber blinds, some of which are fixed to the verandah framework externally with vertical battens. Ripple iron awnings provide weather protection to the eastern side of the building and rear northern verandah which is very wide and has parquetry flooring. French doors with fanlights lead from the veranda into the rooms of the homestead. The west section has been utilised for bathroom facilities and entry to the kitchen and utility section. The main entrance comprises a four-panelled clear-finished timber door with fanlight and sidelights. All glazing panels including the arched panels in the sidelights and pairs of arched panels in the door are decorated with leadlight in an Art Nouveau inspired pattern.

Heritage listing  Strathmore Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 November 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Strathmore Homestead is important for its historical significance illustrating the opening of the Kennedy District in northern Queensland for pastoralism. Established in 1862 Strathmore is of exceptional significance in Queensland's history as one of the earliest pastoral properties established in the region and for its continuous use as an operating pastoral station since its establishment. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Strathmore Homestead is significant as it retains evidence of early building types such as the slab hut (s), the core of which is now used as a living quarters for staff. As an example of a very early slab structure in this part of Queensland the building would be particularly important as an uncommon example. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Strathmore Homestead is significant as it demonstrates typical characteristics of a large pastoral station complex that has evolved over time in a regional area of Queensland. The complex contributes to our understanding of how a regional Queensland pastoral station functioned and demonstrates the way of life of a homestead from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. The principal built elements of Strathmore include the main homestead (), a slab building now used as a staff kitchen and dining room, staff quarters/cottages, school room and school house, office, stables, meathouses, swimming pool complex, former zoo, a weir, sheds and yards. The buildings are set within landscaped grounds and there is a small cemetery nearby. The phoenix palm-lined main entrance to Strathmore is notable particularly as phoenix palms (Phoenix canariensis) are not common in North Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Strathmore Homestead is important for its aesthetic significance. The complex including the main homestead building and the avenue of phoenix palms leading to the entrance, the composition of elements including the slab building, cottages, stables and yards, and the patina of age provided by the variety of materials and forms, contribute to the picturesque qualities of the site. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Strathmore Homestead is particularly important for its association with the Cunningham family, one of the oldest pastoral families in North Queensland. The Cunninghams have been connected with the Bowen area since the early 1860s and with Strathmore since 1902, an association that continues to the present.

It is divided into two phases linked by a staircase. The park is distinct from the similarly-named Hong Ning Road Recreation Ground, which is located down the hill closer to Kwun Tong Town Centre. History The park was first planned by the former Urban Council as early as 1977. At that time, the site was home to the Hong Ning Road Licensed Area (a squatter area). In 1976 it was reported that there were 1,433 people living in poor conditions here. Most residents were resettled in modern public housing. During heavy rainfall on 12 June 2001 and 27 June 2001, boulders fell from the hillslope above Hong Ning Road Park (Phase 2), causing minor damage and resulting in the temporary closure of the park. Description Hong Ning Road Park (Phase 1) has numerous sports facilities. It was designed by Liang Peddle Thorp Architects in a contemporary style and built by Kaden Construction Limited at a cost of $62 million between April 1997 to March 1999. More than 60,000 cubic metres of material was excavated in the course of construction. Phase 1 comprises a children's playground, fitness stations, a jogging track, a gateball court, tennis courts, and a building housing the park office, toilets, and changing room. Hong Ning Road Park (Phase 2) is a Chinese-style garden with various pavilions, a fish pond, and a public toilet. The park has a tranquil environment and is linked to Phase 1 via a long staircase. The name is actually a misnomer, as Phase 2 is located on Hip Wo Street and has no frontage on Hong Ning Road. Redevelopment plan The government plans to redevelop the existing Tsun Yip Street Playground, in the Kwun Tong Industrial Estate, into a \\"Kwun Tong Industrial Culture Park\\". Hence, the government proposes to reprovision the displaced facilities from Tsun Yip Street Playground to the Hong Ning Road Park (Phase 1). Preliminary plans by the Architectural Services Department indicate that the existing gateball court will be replaced with basketball courts, the existing tennis courts will be replaced with a football pitch, and the existing changing room block will be replaced with a bridge structure connecting to a new gateball court on top of the hill.

It was designed by Douglas Francis Woodcraft Roberts and built from 1935 to 1941 by day labour. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995.  History  Constructed in 1935 on a site adjacent to the existing 1897 court house, this was the third court house in Ayr. The Burdekin River region was first settled in the 1860s, and the town of Ayr was surveyed in 1882. Tenders was called for a Court House and Police Station in Ayr in late 1882, and a building was erected in 1883 which comprised the police quarters, lock-up and court room. This building was situated on Allotment 6, bounded by Queen, Khedive (now Mackenzie), Omar (now Graham) and Bey (now Young) Streets. The Post and Telegraph Office and Residence were also located on this block. The town grew in support of the increasing number of sugar plantations and small sugar growers establishing themselves in the Burdekin region. By late 1896 the court room was inadequate for court purposes. Construction on a new court house commenced in 1897, the former room being taken over for use by the police. The new court house was built on a site south east of the police building, at the corner of Queen and Khedive Streets. Ayr was almost completely destroyed by Cyclone Leonta in 1903; much of the town was rebuilt after the cyclone. Part of the court house roof was damaged during the cyclone. Ayr and the surrounding district experienced an unprecedented period of growth through the 1920s and 1930s as a result of the expansion of the sugar industry, and other developments in the district from the turn of the century. The formation of the Ayr Tramway Joint Board and the opening of the railway connecting Ayr and Stuart (Townsville) in 1901 overcame many difficulties previously associated with transporting sugar to the port in Townsville. The Ayr-Stuart line became a government railway in January 1913. The early farmers in the Ayr district found that the supply of water to irrigate their cane crops was inadequate. Several irrigation schemes were proposed, however none eventuated until the Queensland Government approved an irrigation scheme for the district in July 1916. The Inkerman Supply Board was constituted in February 1917 and the Irrigation Plant was opened in May 1922. While the Great Depression was affecting most other parts of the country, the sugar towns of Queensland experienced steady growth and stable economies. Additions to the court house in 1928 provided an office for the Department of Labour. By the early 1930s, the court house was again inadequate for the demands being placed upon it, and further additions to the building were proposed. In a deputation in 1934 to the Hon John Dash, then MLA for Mundingburra (which included Ayr), members of the Ayr Progress Association presented a case for a new building, citing, amongst other reasons, the lack of room at the court house; the recent approval by the Commonwealth Government for a new Post Office and Residence in Ayr; and the importance of the business being transacted on daily and weekly bases in Ayr, as reasons for a new building. Approval was given for the erection of a new court house in December 1934, which would include a court room, witness rooms, rooms for a police officer, Clerk of Petty Sessions and four clerks, and a public space. Drawings for the new court house were prepared in 1935 by architect DFW Roberts, employed in the Queensland Works Department (Andrew Baxter Leven was Chief Architect at this time). The Ayr Court House is based on the early traditional \\"T\\" shaped plan of court houses, which were most commonly constructed in timber. The Ayr and Home Hill Court Houses are the only two examples of brick versions of this \\"T\\" plan form. Most other court houses of this period were adopting different plan forms. Provision was made in the drawings for future additions to be made to the verandahs at either end of the \\"T\\". Three distinct entrances to the building separated members of the public who had business dealings with the Clerk of Petty Sessions, from those who were appearing in the court house as a witness, or who were attending a court hearing. A description of the new court house prior to its completion concluded by stating that \\"The Buildings will be an imposing structure and should prove an acquisition to the Architecture of the City\\". During the 1930s Depression, Labor Premier William Forgan Smith established a government initiated works scheme under the Income (Unemployment Relief) Act (1930) to create employment. This involved the employment of architects, foremen, labourers and the use of local materials in the design and construction of government buildings such as court houses, government offices and state schools. The Ayr court house is a fine example of the brick buildings erected through this work scheme. The court house was completed and officially opened in March 1936, and the former court house taken over for use as the police station shortly after. Offices in the building were occupied also by staff of other government departments, such as the Agriculture and Stock Department. Additional offices were constructed in 1941, at the south west end of the building. Landscaping of the court house grounds was undertaken in the early 1950s.  Description  Ayr Court House, 1938 Ayr Court House is a single-storeyed red brick building. The gabled and half- gabled roof is clad in corrugated steel and is surmounted by a painted copper fleche. The roof's original russet-coloured fibro cement slates, have been replaced with corrugated steel sheeting. The wide verandahs on four sides have timber balustrading and paired posts on brick piers. The entrance portico is marked with a decorative parapet. The Ayr Court House is one of several buildings that contribute to the town's civic precinct in the main street, Queen Street. The police station, court house, town hall, library and post office dominate the north-west side of Queen Street between Mackenzie and Young Streets.  Heritage listing  Ayr Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Completed in 1936 as the third court house in Ayr, this building survives as an example of the development of Ayr as a commercial and official centre for the surrounding district from the late 19th century, and of the prosperity accompanying the expansion of settlement and the sugar industry in the Ayr district during the early 20th century. Designed and constructed as part of a Government initiated Works scheme created to generate employment throughout Queensland during the 1930s, the Ayr Court House is also a fine example of the work completed under this scheme. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Ayr Court House is a good example of a substantial brick court house which reflects the high standard of Government buildings in Queensland designed by the Department of Public Works during the early-mid twentieth century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The form, scale and materials of the building, contribute to the Queen Street streetscape and Ayr townscape.

The diocese was erected in 1586 by Pope Sixtus V (Felice Peretti di Montalto), a native of the town. The diocese was suppressed in 1986, and its territory was assigned to a new entity, called the Diocese of San Benedetto del Tronto‚ÄìRipatransone‚ÄìMontalto.\\"Diocese of Montalto (delle Marche)\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org.

In a bull of 18 December 1924, Pope Pius XI united the Diocese of Ripatransone with the diocese of Montalto ad personam episcopi. He appointed Luigi Ferri as Bishop of Ripatransone with Montalto, and ordered a change in the title of the bishop to Episcopus Montis alti et Ripanus.\\"Cathedrali Ecclesiae Ripanae, cum Ecclesia Montis alti in personam unitae, R.

In 1980, the diocese of Montalto had a population of only 31,500 persons.Annuario pontificio 1981. =Restructuring= The Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), in order to ensure that all Catholics received proper spiritual attention, decreed the reorganization of the diocesan structure of Italy and the consolidation of small and struggling dioceses. It also recommended the abolition of anomalous units such as exempt territorial prelatures.In its decree Christus Dominus, section 22, it stated: \\"Concerning diocesan boundaries, therefore, this sacred synod decrees that, to the extent required by the good of souls, a fitting revision of diocesan boundaries be undertaken prudently and as soon as possible. This can be done by dividing dismembering or uniting them, or by changing their boundaries, or by determining a better place for the episcopal see or, finally, especially in the case of dioceses having larger cities, by providing them with a new internal organization.... At the same time the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units. For this reason, obviously, the territory of each diocese should be continuous.\\" These considerations applied to Montalto and to Ripatransone as the population migrated in the post-war period to jobs on the coast at San Benedetto. On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of Normae was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Ripatransone and Montalto be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Dioecesis Sancti Benedicti ad Truentum-Ripana-Montis Alti. The seat of the diocese was to be in San Benedetto del Tronto, and the church of S. Maria della Marina was to serve as the cathedral of the merged dioceses. The cathedrals in Ripatransone and Montalto were to become co-cathedrals, and the cathedral Chapters were each to be a Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in San Benedetto del Tronto, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Montalto and Ripatransone.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1987), pp. 747-749.

The Circle of Poison (COP) refers to the export of domestically banned pesticides for use on foods elsewhere, some of which returns by way of import. The \\"circle\\" is complete when the toxic chemicals that were exported are then used to grow fruit, meat, and produce that are imported and available for domestic consumption. This circle was first identified relative to the United States but the relationship also exists between other nations of the Global North and South. __TOC__ History of concept In the book, Circle of Poison: Pesticides and People in a Hungry World, David Weir and Mark Schapiro of the Oakland-based Center for Investigative Reporting present an investigative study of how certain dangerous chemicals, which are banned in the U.S., still enter back into the United States and the American diet through food imports. Many restricted chemicals, especially pesticides, are produced in the U.S. and exported to the global south. The banned chemicals are then used on 'cash crops', which are subsequently exported to the U.S. and other industrialized countries for high profit. The investigative study done by Wier and Schapiro showed that the highly potent and dangerous chemicals used in domestic agriculture led to a public clamor for strict regulations, and that pesticides contribute to the expansion of an export-oriented agriculture at the expense of food production for local needs. Even where they are applied to food crops, pesticide are often linked to the Green Revolution, which can mean more hunger even while it raises production. Pesticides, they argue, are no solution to hunger-they bypass the needs of the poor who 'have neither money to buy food nor the land to grow it on'. Moreover, they claim because agrochemical companies are profit driven, they have tailored the regulations to permit unrestricted export of dangerous chemicals. Wier and Schapiro argue that this loophole has been a disaster. Circle of Poison Prevention Act of 1991 In April 1991, the \\"Circle of Poison prevention Act\\" was introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) in the U.S. Senate and by Representatives Mike Synar (D-OK) and Leon Panetta (D-CA) in the House. This bill would have placed strict controls on exports of hazardous chemicals. Similar legislation passed both houses of Congress but died in conference committee. In brief, the \\"Circle of Poison Prevention Act\\" would have: * Prohibited the export of pesticides that were not registered for domestic use; were not registered for food use and would not be exported for use on food; or had had the majority of registration canceled. * Permitted government to refuse the import of certain hazardous pesticides, including restricted-use pesticides and those which were conditionally registered or were the subject of cancellation proceedings. * Permitted citizens to file suit against violators to enforce the law. * Automatically revoked tolerances for pesticide residues on food for pesticides no longer registered in the U.S. * Required EPA to disseminate information on non-chemical pest control alternatives and sponsored meetings to develop improved strategies for sustainable agriculture, including integrated pest management and the use of non-chemical alternatives. Pesticide regulations The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the United States; before a pesticide can be sold, it must be licensed or registered by the EPA. While registration does not constitute \\"approval\\" by the EPA, it means that the agency has determined that a pesticide will not cause 'unreasonable adverse effects' on humans or the environment. The EPA may cancel or suspend the registration of a pesticide, if further evidence indicates that its use poses unreasonable hazard. Or it may restrict the uses for which it may be sold to very specific crops and application practices. The EPA does not have the authority to prohibit the export of canceled or suspended pesticides; nor may it forbid the export of restricted use pesticides that may be equally hazardous in the hands of untrained applicators or new compounds, which have never been granted registration. Consequently, millions of pounds of pesticides, which have been determined to be unsafe for use in the U.S, are shipped to foreign ports. Pesticide residue data A 2005 summary report of pesticide residue done by the Pesticide Data Program (a program started by the United States Department of Agriculture) showed that out of 10,154 foods tested, fruits and vegetables such as apples and lettuce had the most pesticide residue. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"6\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" !

The Secretary has delegated this responsibility to the Food and Drug Administration.

It was designed by Frederick Smith and built in 1937 by local builder AS Wight. It is also known as Ayr Shire Council Chambers. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 October 1997.  History  Burdekin Shire Council Chambers at Ayr was completed in 1922 as Ayr Shire Council Chambers, replacing an 1890s timber building destroyed by fire in 1919. The 1922 building was designed by local architect Frederick Smith and extended in the late 1930s. Ayr was established in 1882 to service the developing sugar-growing district on the Lower Burdekin River. In the early 1860s the land was taken up as pastoral runs, but during the second half of the 1860s and 1870s, following the introduction of the British Government's Sugar and Coffee Regulations of 1864, pastoral holdings on the Lower Burdekin gradually converted to sugar cultivation. By the late 1880s, four sugar mills had been established in the Burdekin. When local government was extended to all Queenslanders in 1879, with the passing of the Divisional Boards Act, the Lower Burdekin was included in Subdivision 3 of the Thuringowa Division, based in Townsville, while the area south of the Burdekin was included in the Wangaratta Division. The Lower Burdekin community became concerned that its problems were not being addressed by the Thuringowa Divisional Board, because board members from the district found it difficult to get to meetings in Townsville. An attempt to overcome these problems was made in September 1883 when the Lower Burdekin was included in Subdivision 2 and the remainder of the division within subdivision 1. Despite these boundary alterations the problem of distance from Townsville could not be overcome so easily. A petition seeking to have the Lower Burdekin made a separate division was unsuccessful; despite support from the Thuringowa Board, the Minister for Lands rejected the petition. A further petition prepared in 1884, pointing out that the population of 2,000 people centred on Ayr, was not acknowledged. To maintain pressure on the government, residents formed the Burdekin Delta Association and a further petition was successful. The Ayr Division was proclaimed in 1888 but comprised only land north of the Burdekin River. Board members were elected in 1888 and a reserve for a municipal chambers gazetted in April 1889, but lack of government funding combined with the devastating effects of the early 1890s depression, prohibited Ayr Divisional Board from erecting its own premises until 1895, when an office and board room were constructed. This building was damaged in 1903 by Cyclone Leonta, but was repaired. Under the Local Authorities Act of 1903 all Divisions in the State became Shires, and the Ayr Division became the Shire of Ayr. In 1917 local architect Frederick Smith was engaged to design a strong room for safe storage of documents. Smith had been an articled pupil of the family firm of WG Smith and Sons, Architects in Townsville. He was employed by both the Queensland and Commonwealth Government as Clerk of Works, Ayr (1916‚Äì17) and District Supervisor, Ayr. His other buildings in Ayr included the Delta Theatre (1910) and the public hospital (1917). A fire in 1919 destroyed the 1895 building, but not the strongroom. After the fire, Council erected temporary offices next to the strong room and sought a loan to build substantial new brick chambers for the rapidly expanding shire. Frederick Smith prepared the plans and the tender of local builder AS Wight, for , was accepted. The foundation stone was laid by Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan on 25 July 1921 and the brick and concrete chambers measuring , with a surrounding wide verandah, was completed early in 1922. These dimensions and early photographs suggest the building was symmetrical about the central hallway, with the meeting room to one side and two offices to the other, and an arched portico at the entrance. Apart from its role as Council Chambers, the meeting room has been used by many local groups including the local branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association and the Chamber of Commerce, and the cane-cutters sign-on in 1935. The 1917 strongroom appears to now form part of the rear verandah. The sugar industry sustained the local economy during the 1930s depression, and the district expanded. Although plans for extensions to the Council Chambers, including a second storey and rear extension, were rejected as being too costly at , ground floor extensions, at half the original projected cost, were completed in 1939. This extension appears included the present second entrance corridor and the wing of 4 offices to the southeast, and the consequent extension of the verandah and roof. The construction of the rooflight, the second arched portico reflecting the first, and the new curved entrance portico may also have been constructed at this time. The southwest verandahs were enclosed in the early 1970s to allow for more office space while those on the northeast side were enclosed at an earlier date. Ayr's \\"twin town\\" of Home Hill was established by 1913 to promote development south of the Burdekin River. By the mid-20th century, the name of the Shire of Ayr was no longer considered representative of the whole of the local government area, and in 1946 the Home Hill Chamber of Commerce suggested the composite name Ayr-Home Hill Shire. The name was never adopted, but in 1976 the Council applied to become the Burdekin Shire. Although the Place Names Board pointed out that the Council district covered only part of the Burdekin, representations from local politicians over several years resulted in the new name Shire of Burdekin on 10 June 1982, Ayr's centenary year. In 2016, the building continues to be the main venue for the council's meetings and its customer services.  Description  The Burdekin Shire Council Chambers is a single-storeyed building located at the northern corner of a level block bound by Young, MacMillan and Wickham Streets, Ayr, addressing Young Street. The site is one block from the main street, Queen Street, which forms part of the Bruce Highway. Several church buildings and the Masonic Hall are located nearby along MacMillan Street. The building is constructed of face brickwork with a hipped corrugated iron roof and encircling timber verandah. Centred on the ridge is a skylight. The verandah is open on its two street elevations, with a concrete floor, dowelled balustrades and stop-chamfered posts. The south-eastern and south-western verandahs are enclosed and clad in chamferboards. At the rear is a brick safe with a steel door opening into the office. The entry to the building is marked by a curved concrete portico, flanked by gabled pavilions with arched openings. The interior is divided into three by two parallel hallways. The two pairs of entry doors are aligned with the arched pavilions either side of the front portico. The north-western end is the meeting room, with French doors opening onto the north-western verandah. It has a decorative cornice, and low- waisted four-panel doors with fretted toplights. The central bays has two offices with moulded arched openings. The south-eastern end four offices opening from a central corridor. The interior features rendered brick walls, high ceilings with decorative cornices, double-hung and leadlight windows and panelled doors with fretted toplights.  Heritage listing  Burdekin Shire Council Chambers was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 October 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Burdekin Shire Council Chambers, erected in 1922 during a period of expansion in the sugar industry, demonstrates the role of the Shire Council in the development of Burdekin Shire as one of Queensland's most important sugar-producing districts. It is the earliest surviving Council building on the Council reserve, which once included the Shire Clerk's residence, stables and fire station. The Burdekin Shire Chambers is close to other historic places including Anzac Park, Masonic Lodge, the former Presbyterian Church and an imposing house at 115 MacMillan Street, thus making a substantial contribution to the historic streetscape of the town. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Burdekin Shire Council Chambers is a substantial brick building occupying a prominent corner position, and makes an important aesthetic contribution to the Ayr townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Burdekin Shire Council Chambers, an important example of the work of local architect Frederick Smith and local builder AS Wight, is valued by the community who expressed their concern in 1996 when the Council proposed alterations to the structure.

He had been appointed the office after Louis the German's conquest in 828, and subsequent Christianization of the Moravians (828‚Äì33). In 833, according to the Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum, a Slavic prince, Pribina, had been \\"driven across the Danube by Mojmir, duke of the Moravians\\", and fled to Radbod in East Francia around 833. Radbod introduced him to King Louis the German, who ordered that Pribina should be \\"instructed in the faith and baptized\\", and that he serve with his followers in Radbod's army. Before long, however, Radbod and Pribina fell out, and the latter, fearing for his life, fled with his son Koceƒæ to the First Bulgarian Empire, and then to Lower Pannonia ruled by a Slavic duke, Ratimir. Since Lower Pannonia was part of Radbod's prefecture, Ratimir's harboring of Pribina was tantamount to rebellion, therefore, in 838, Louis the German sent Radbod at the head of a large Bavarian army to crush Ratimir, but Pribina and his followers took refuge with the count of Carniola, Salacho. In short time the latter brokered a reconciliation between Radbod and Pribina, and Louis solved the ongoing instability by appointing Pribina as his faithful dux with lands in around the Zala river. Radbod held contacts with Rastislav (r. 847‚Äì70), ruler of the Moravians (successor to Mojmir), who had long posed a danger to Bavaria. According to the Annals of St-Bertin, in 853 Charles the Bald, king of West Francia, bribed the Bulgarians to ally with the Slavs (apparently the Moravians) and together attack Louis the German's kingdom. In the course of the Bulgarian-Moravian attack, Louis the German deposed Radbod in 854 for infidelity, after an uprising. Radbod then formed a rebel alliance with Rastislav. In 855, Rastislav (Rastiz) rebelled, and Carloman was made prefect in Radbod's place in 856. Carloman's 858 campaign forced Rastislav to make peace.

Since 2003, she has released three documentaries: Galileo's Sons (2003), Love at the Twilight Hotel (2009), and Star Men (2014). Rose has won and been nominated for several awards including, a Gemini award for Galileo's Sons, which she won in 2004, and the Order of Ontario, which she received in 2012.  Personal life  Alison Rose was born in Markdale, Ontario. She created her own production company, Inigo Films, in 2001. She has degrees in journalism and political science and has received awards for her writing. She is a national newspaper award winner. Rose also volunteers, helping to feed the hungry in Toronto, Ontario. Rose describes giving back as a \\"gift.\\" \\"It anchors my week, it provides structure in my life that would otherwise be lacking because I'm self-employed and somewhat undisciplined...it gives me people to care about...I've always wanted to help.\\"  Career  Rose created Inigo Films in 2001. She made the Gemini award-winning Galileo's Sons (2003), a documentary about the Vatican Observatory. The film explored the history of the Jesuits and their relation to astrophysicists, as well as, the rivalry between science and religion centering around the trial of Galileo. In 2009, Rose completed work on her second documentary, Love at the Twilight Hotel. Set in motels along the infamous Little Havana strip in Miami, Florida, the film interviews men and women who had encounters with drug deals, prostitution, and robbery in the motels. Rose spent three years making the film, staying in motels and meeting men and women who frequented the area. In June 2015, Rose released Star Men, a documentary that follows a reunion of four astronomers as they embark on a nostalgic road trip in the American Southwest. Donald Lynden- Bell, Roger Griffin, Wal Sargent and Neville Woolf are the subjects of the film. After earning their PhDs in England, they went on to do post-doctoral research in California in 1960/61 and the four explored the Western United States on holidays. Rose's Star Men depicts a reunion of such a journey almost fifty years later. Rather than concentrate solely on the scientific process, Star Men depicts the passion the scientists have for their work. Aging is another theme the film explores; the astronomers, all in their twilight years, confront physical deficiency and terminal illness, with Wal Sargent dying seven months after the reunion.

Now in its site is Casa Cordero, that is the first apartment building built in the city. The now defunct Convento de San Felipe el Real (English: Convent of Saint Philip the Royal) (briefly called as San Felipe el Real) was a former Madrilenian convent of Calced Augustinian monks, located at the beginning of Calle Mayor in Madrid, next to the Puerta del Sol.Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna, (1987), \\"Historia de la Puerta del Sol\\", Almambru Built between 16th and 17th centuries, was rise on a large pedestal (with protected perimeter of railings), was part of it a famous talking shop of the city (the Steps of San Felipe). One of its famous guests was Friar Luis de Le√≥n. It was opposite the Palacio de O√±ate.  History  The beginning of the convent can be traced to 1539 when Francisco Osorio proposed to the City Council of Madrid the creation of a Convent of Calced Augustinian. Archbishop of Toledo, Don Juan Mart√≠nez Sil√≠ceo, refused alleging that in Madrid in that moment had two monasteries of mendicant friars: that of San Francisco and that of Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha. However the Archbishop of Toledo had to cede to the pleas of people coming to royalty such as Prince Philip II, Maria of Aragon, aunt of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Prioress of the Augustinian Convent of Nuestra Se√±ora de Gracia de Madrigal de las Altas Torres, or Leonor de Mascare√±as. The Augustinian convent of San Felipe el Real was founded in 1547 by bull of Pope Paul III of June 20.Luis Araujo-Costa, (1945),¬´Hombres y Cosas de La Puerta del Sol¬ª, Madrid, pp:18-23 The temple was dedicated to Saint Philip the Apostle as was Prince Philip II a great devotee of him. For its construction was used part of a site owned by Count of Orgaz located near the wide street of Puerta del Sol (as it was called to the Puerta), which ceded to the Order in exchange for a chapel. On the axis of the current calle de Esparteros was the entrance to the convent. At first it built a wooden chapel, inaugurated on March 14 of 1545. The church was carried out according to Plans of Luis and Gaspar de Vega. To save the uneven ground the building was mounted on a platform or \\"lonja\\", underneath which a number of locals or \\"covachuelas\\" were stablished serving as markets. This space around the convent had been ceded by the City Council of Madrid under the condition of being clear and not be used for any purpose other than the public. On August 22, 1622 was murdered Juan de Tassis y Peralta Count of Villamediana in the door of the neighboring Palacio de O√±ate. The church suffered a fire in 1718 and, during the French Napoleonic Invasion the whole was very mistreated. After the Confiscation of Mendiz√°bal was demolished in 1838 to widen Calle Mayor and, instead, the first apartment building in the city was built, the Casa Cordero (1842-1845). = Steps of San Felipe = The steps of San Felipe, crowded in a picture of 17th century. During 16th century the convent had a strong walls to isolate the convent life outside the bustle of the Puerta del Sol. The construction of the facade by architect Juan Guti√©rrez Toribio led a step surface that was called Lonja de San Felipe. Gathered the Madrid's inhabitants in this area to exchange news, rumors, calumnies, inventions, secrets and opinions. For this reason it was called \\"mentidero\\" of Madrid. The steps of San Felipe (Las Gradas de San Felipe) was also a gathering place to recruit soldiers destined to the Spanish Netherlands during the War of Flanders. One day, due to the weight caused by the crush of people gathered on it to witness the prison of a reprobate, the balcony of the lonja sank. The accident caused many deaths and injuries.  Features  Its Renaissance cloister was considered one of the best in the city and the Court. A part of the known lonja with the steps that was called el mentidero, San Felipe el Real had under its floor a galleries called covachuelas that were marketplaces of different goods of various kinds, including toys and books.

Pushpa Srivatsan is an ardent worshipper of Sadguru Sri Tyagabrahmam (4 May 1767 ‚Äì 6 January 1847) of Tiruvaiyaru, Tamil Nadu. She is a Sarasvati Veena artiste. Pushpa picked up the rudiments of the Veena Dhanammal technique from Sri R. Rangaramanuja Ayyangar, a great admirer of Veena Dhanammal and her disciple for 12 years. Reclusive by nature, Pushpa does not give public performances. For her music is worship.Dr. Veezhinathan, Centinarion, Vol. 1, Jul 1994Dr. V. Sadagopan, Sangeetham, Vol. 13, p.29; Publ. CARNATIC MUSIC ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA Her veena music and singing are entirely for her Sadguru. She has written prolifically on the Sadguru in chaste Sanskrit. She has also projected onto the Sadguru her ecstatic experiences in the Himalayas, the Ganga and the majestic sea ‚Äì again in Sanskrit prose and poetry.Deifying the Himalayas, The Hindu, 30 Dec 2005 All her writings contain her own English and Tamil translations.Indian Express, 2-5 April 1994 Music The specialities of Pushpa's veena music are singing along with the veena, voice totally blending with the instrument; and not using plectrum (no contact mike either). The subtle overtones of her veena are sweetly audible when she plays without the metallic jangle of plectrums. She plays all the charanams (sub- sections of a song) for each kriti (song). Some of her home recordings are available in archive.org. Writings Pushpa‚Äôs writings are spontaneous expressions of inner experience.Indian Express, 17 April 1994[Indian Express, 2‚Äì5 April 1994] She has written Namavalis (series of names and adjectives of the Lord), Gadyams (lilting poetic prose in Sanskrit) and Stotras (adulations unto the Lord) in different meters on the Sadguru.Indian Express, 2-5 April 1994 She has also written more than 1200 slokas (verses in a particular meter in Sanskrit poetry) on Mother Ganga (unrivalled), several stotras on different deities, and the story of Sri Rama in her own words (again in sloka form). A special feature of her writing is different shades of meaning and nuances that enable realistic visualization of the descriptions.Dr. Veezhinathan, Centinarion Vol. 1, Jul 1994Unique Work on Thyagaraja, The Hindu, 15 Feb 1994 For example, in the chapter Sri Ganga Raga Pushpavali (in Sri Gangasahasram), adjectives for Ganga also happen to form the names of ragas of the Carnatic gamut. So Ganga is additionally described as the embodiment of raga (melody/beauty) and identified with the swarupa (nature and form) of the raga. Her books have won wide acclaim from eminent Sanskrit scholars.Ardent Devotee of Thyagaraja, The Hindu, 20 Jul 2001Indian Express, 2-5 April 1994 Sri Swami Dayananda SaraswatiForeword, p. v, Sri Ganga SahasramHimalaya Gadyam, p. vSadguru Sri Tyagabrahma Pushpanjali, p. xi and Sri Seva SrinivasaraghavachariarSadguru Sri Tyagabrahma Pushpanjali, p. xviii-xliii (Sewa Swami; himself a composer in Sanskrit and President Awardee) were the first to read her work in manuscript form, appreciate and insist on publishing.Sadguru Sri Tyagabrahma Pushpanjali, p.xvii(A recluse, Pushpa did not want publicity to her own innermost sacred thoughtsDr. V. Sadagopan, Sangeetham, Vol. 13, p.29; Publ. CARNATIC MUSIC ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA). Swami Dayananda‚Äôs guru, Sri Swami Tarananda Giri of Haridwar, would spend any length of time listening to her poetry. The appreciation from this legend was more than any award for Pushpa. On his attaining samadhi in Haridwar (2004), she instantaneously composed eight verses on him (p.3 of Sri Dayananda Stotravali). Swami Dayananda read out these verses during the final rites as well as at the Rishikesh Ashram. Personal life Pushpavalli (named after the Goddess of Tirukkovilur in Tamil Nadu) was born to Smt. Lakshmi and Sri Pattangi Venkatavaradan at Tiruvahindrapuram, Cuddalore. She is married to Sri N.V.Vathsan, IPS. Her two daughters, Radhika Vathsan and Gayatri Vathsan, are trained by her, from early childhood, in vocal music and the Sarasvati veena. History A postgraduate in mathematics from Presidency College, Madras, with 1st class distinction, Pushpa was a lecturer in mathematics in Sri Sarada College, Salem for a few years. She gave up her career to pursue music full- time.Dr. V. Sadagopan, Sangeetham, Vol. 13, p.29; Publ. CARNATIC MUSIC ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA Pushpa learnt the fundamental technique of the Veena Dhanammal bani (style) and quite a few kritis from Shri Rangaramanuja Ayyangar. Sri Ayyangar had studied Dhanammal's music deeply and imbibed the subtle nuances of her veena technique, which he immortalised by his notations in his book Kritimanimalai of 4 volumes. Pushpa learnt many more kritis by herself from Kritimanimalai, in which he has given detailed notation with special emphasis on gamakas (musical embellishments). She played them before him and won his hearty appreciation. It is commonly said that while western classical music can be played by the artiste reading from a music sheet, the same is not possible for Carnatic music due to its unique gamakas. This may be true to a certain extent; but every rule has an exception. Today Pushpa has home recordings of about 150 hours of veena music. She has dedicated the 700-odd kritis that she has recorded to the memory of Shri Rangaramanuja Ayyangar. Books authored by Smt.

By 2015, it said it had powered 150,000 households in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, with around 10,000 mobile payments made by users on its cloud platform, M-Kopanet, made on a daily basis. It had over $40 million of revenue by 2015. In 2015, M-Kopa estimated that 80 percent of its customers lived on less than $2 a day.

Business model and products Customers pay a deposit of 3,500 KES (approx $35), take the system home then pay 50 KES (approx $0.50) a day for a period of one year, to own the solar system. Daily payments are made through M-Pesa, a mobile phone based money system, at about 45 cents a day. This way, in addition to getting solar power, customers also slowly off-set the cost of the device. As of 2015, after 12 months of regular payments, the solar system is fully owned by the customer who can use it for free access to solar energy. According to the company, part of the business model's plan is to offset the dangerous use of kerosene (paraffin) lamps to light homes that are off electric grids. The system also helps customers who need to charge batteries and mobile phones. In 2015, the M-Kopa III device had one solar panel, two LED lights, a USB phone charger, and a solar powered radio that was portable.

Early life Liu was born in Shaanxi Province in 1910. After participating in the May Thirtieth Movement of 1925 at the age of 14, Liu joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1926 and the Communist Party of China in September 1928 at the age of 17. Liu and fellow communist Liu Zhidan organized a resistance movement to the Kuomintang in northern Shaanxi. In August 1930, Liu was captured and imprisoned. After his release, he went to Hebei Province, where he was betrayed, captured a second time and imprisoned in Beiping alongside An Ziwen and Bo Yibo. In September 1936, Liu and others were freed following the efforts of the communist underground, and he started work in Tianjin. Sino- Japanese War At the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Liu went to the main communist base at the border of Shaanxi and Gansu Province. In 1938, he was sent to the border area of Shanxi, Hebei and Chahar Province to assist Peng Zhen and Nie Rongzhen. In 1944, he arrived in Yan'an to serve as an alternate member of the 7th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Chinese Civil War At the start of the second phase of the Chinese Civil War, Liu assisted the communist leadership in transferring from northern Shaanxi to the Shanxi-Hebei-Chahar base area. When the base area merged with that on the border of Shandong and Henan Province, Liu was one of those responsible for the entirety of northern China. Post-1949 After the formation of the People's Republic of China, Liu served as a full member of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He was one of those who investigated the case of Liu Qingshan (1916-1952) and Zhang Zishan (1914-1952), two communist officials who used their positions for private gain. Liu and Zhang were both publicly executed. At the start of the Cultural Revolution, Liu was caught up in the case of the 61 Renegades alongside Bo Yibo, An Ziwen and others. As a result, he was imprisoned for 8 years, during which time his wife committed suicide. In 1978, after his release, Liu was named vice-chair of the United Front Work Department. In July 1979, Liu was made a vice-chairman of the 5th CPPCC and in September of that was selected as a member of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He served on the Central Advisory Commission from September 1982 to September 1992. He was made a vice-chairman of the 6th CPPCC in June 1983. Liu died in Beijing on 31 December 1997.

Location  The park is located in Moabit, a division of Mitte, the central borough of Berlin. It is bounded to the north by Turmstra√üe, Alt-Moabit to the south, Ottostra√üe to the west, and Wilsnacker Stra√üe to the east. Stromstra√üe and Thusnelda-Allee pass through the park from north to south, as does line U9 of the Berlin U-Bahn; the subway station Turmstra√üe is also located adjacent from the park.  History  The park was once part of a much larger communally administered forest area Jungfernheide. Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg annexed it as a counterpart to the much larger Gro√üer Tiergarten as the city of Berlin grew and usurped the former hunting grounds. Since 1655, the park has been referred to as the Kleiner Tiergarten. In the year 1790, the park was replanted; further redesign took place in 1835 in connection with the newly built designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. After the city of Berlin took over the administration of the area in 1876, landscape architect and horticultural director Johann Heinrich Gustav Meyer redesigned the park to contain benches, lanterns, and a spring. The was constructed from 1892-1894, designed by Friedrich Schulze facing Thusnelda-Allee.

The cartoon follows Donald Duck as he works at the Royal Bros. department store, where he goofs off by breaking gifts and wrapping them poorly. Plot Donald Duck arrives late to his job at Royal Bros. as a gift wrapper. He clocks in, uses a magnet to set the time back a few hours, then situates himself at his work table. Toys come zooming down past him, creating a whirlwind that strips his clothes off. He quickly retrieves them and makes his way over to the pile of gifts. Donald plays with the toys and pretends to work at the same time. He then pulls out his lunch and pours coffee in his cup. The boss's speaker horn sneezes the coffee all over Donald's face and ends up watching Donald, who throws a temper tantrum. As the boss scolds him, Donald now apologizes. After pretending to work and playing for a while, his boss announces that \\"Production has increased in every single department\\" except for the gift wrapping department. This makes Donald angry. Donald wraps a rocking chair with him inside it. Just as a rush order box comes, Donald gets out of his rocking chair and gets the wrapping paper out. Donald opens a box and finds that it turns out to be a Jack-in-the-box character; he proceeds to play with Jack. When the boss tells him not to play with toys, he gets angry and has trouble with Jack in various ways and has trouble wrapping the box with Jack, who refuses to go back. He uses a vise clamp to hold Jack in his back down. He gets annoyed by the speaker horn and solves the problem by shoving a rubber ball in the speaker. The speaker shoots out the ball as Donald is trying to have his pie, and quickly dodges the ball, but is not fast enough to jump out of the way when the ball hits the clamp and forces Jack in his Jack-in-the-box to spring out and hit Donald into his pie piece. He then decides to tie down the Jack-in-the-box and hold him down by hammering stakes in the floor, only to hear that Jack in his Jack-in-the-box breaks through the floor, before Donald looks out the window and is surprised that Jack went through the floor. He then tries to pull Jack's head out, but ends up getting pulled into the Jack-in-the-box, then gets trapped inside, trying to wrestle with Jack until he finally gets free, but finds that Jack has stolen his blue shirt and blue hat while Donald Duck is wearing Jack's clown accordion costume and his nightcap. He complains until the boss announces that it is quitting time. This excites him, until the boss tells Donald that he has to stay and wrap a few more packages. Donald gets angry and dashes upstairs to beat up his boss. He breaks the speaker pipe in the process before he quits the job.

Built between 1821 and 1824 according to plans designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, it was named after the nearby City Palace (Stadtschloss). The bridge marks the eastern end of the Unter den Linden boulevard. History A bridge at the site, leading across the Spree canal, already existed in the 15th century, when Berlin emerged as the residence of the Brandenburg margraves. The Hohenzollern rulers passed it, when they left their Stadtschloss residence for hunting in the Tiergarten grounds. Then called Hundebr√ºcke, after the accompanying packs of dogs, the pile bridge was rebuilt in 1738 and later served Napoleon's troops as a direct route into the city centre. Schlossbr√ºcke and City Palace, about 1900 In the early 19th century, the wooden bridge was considered inadequate by King Frederick William III of Prussia, who ordered a new prestigious construction and commissioned his court architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. First studies and drafts date from 1819; construction started two years later, then part of a general project to refurbish the whole area on Unter den Linden between Spree and present-day Bebelplatz. From the new arch bridge built of sandstone, the broad Unter den Linden boulevard ran in a direct line to the western city limits at Brandenburg Gate. Schinkel also had the adjacent Lustgarten premises in the east restored and designed the nearby Neue Wache to commemorate the veterans of the Napoleonic Wars. On 29 November 1823, during the marriage of Crown Prince Frederick William IV with Princess Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria, large crowds thronged across the yet uncompleted construction and 22 people drowned falling into the river. The bridge was opened to the traffic in Summer 1824. Again enlarged in 1912 and equipped with a reinforced concrete structure in the 1920s, the bridge suffered only minor damage in World War II. In 1951 the East German authorities renamed it Marx-Engels-Br√ºcke, along with the adjacent Marx- Engels-Platz (present-day Schlo√üplatz). Its original name was restored on 3 October 1991, one year after German reunification. Statues Statues erected on the bridge include: * Athena Arms the Warrior (1851) * Athena Leads the Young Warrior into the Fight (1853) * Athena Protects the Young Hero (1854) * Athena Teaches the Young Man How to Use a Weapon (1853) * Iris Takes the Fallen Hero to Olympus (1857) * Nike Assists the Wounded Warrior (1853) * Nike Crowns the Hero (1853) * Nike Instructs the Boy in Heroic History ReferencesExternal links * Category:Bridges in Berlin Category:Heritage sites in Berlin ","title":"Schlossbr√ºcke"},{"id":"49086173","text":"Talazoparib, sold under the brand name Talzenna, is an orally available poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor developed by Pfizer for the treatment of advanced breast cancer with germline BRCA mutations. Talazoparib is similar to the first in class PARP inhibitor, olaparib. It was approved in October 2018, in the United States and June 2019, in the European Union for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Side effects The most serious side effects in studies were related to the blood forming system and included anaemia (low red blood cell count), neutropenia (low neutrophil blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). Serious forms of these conditions (grade 3 to 4) occurred in 39%, 21% and 15% of patients, respectively. Other adverse effects such as headache, nausea, hair loss and fatigue were mostly mild.Talzenna  Interactions  Combination with drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein or BCRP may increase talazoparib concentrations in the body. Mechanism of action Talazoparib acts as an inhibitor of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) which aids in single strand DNA repair. Cells that have BRCA1/2 mutations are susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of PARP inhibitors because of an accumulation of DNA damage. Talazoparib is theorized to have a higher potency than olaparib due to the additional mechanism of action called PARP trapping. PARP trapping is the mechanism of action where the PARP molecule is trapped on the DNA, which interferes with the cells ability to replicate. Talazoparib is found to be ~100 fold more efficient in PARP trapping than olaparib. However, this increased potency may not translate directly to clinical effectiveness as many other factors must be considered. Commercialization Talazoparib was originally developed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. However, Medivation Inc. acquired all worldwide rights to talazoparib in August 2015, to expand their global oncology franchise. Medivation acquired talazoparib for $410 million with additional payments of up to $160 million in royalties and milestones. Under this agreement, Medivation assumed all financial responsibilities for the continued development, regulatory, and commercialization of talazoparib.

This is planned to change their concept of operations from primarily ground- oriented defence to mobile and coordinated movement of all services and to enhance offensive air and naval capabilities into the East China Sea. The coastal Jinan, Nanjing, and Guangzhou regions will be turned into three military areas, each with a joint operations command, for projecting power into the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and South China Sea.

First published in 1979, Screenplay covers the art and craft of screenwriting. Considered a bestseller shortly after its release, to date it has sold millions of copies. It has served as a reference for Judd Apatow, James Cameron, Frank Darabont, Tina Fey and many other professional screenwriters. Now translated into more than a dozen languages, Screenplay is considered the \\"bible\\" of the screenwriting craft. Overview Screenplay is noted as the first book to identify the three-act screenplay model. At the heart of Field's explanation of how his screenplay model worked was the paradigm. =The Paradigm= In the book, Field outlines the paradigm to which he says most successful screenplays adhere. In Field's view, successful screenplays are made up of three distinct divisions. He calls these setup, confrontation, and resolution, and each of them appears in its own act within a screenplay. * Act I contains the setup. It is approximately the first quarter of a screenplay, and reveals the main character, premise, and situation of the story. * Act II contains the confrontation. It lasts for the next two quarters of the screenplay, and clearly defines the main goal of the protagonist. * Act III contains the resolution. This is the final quarter of the screenplay. This answers the question as to whether or not the main character succeeded in his or her goal. Between each of these acts, the paradigm states that there is a plot point‚Äîan event that spins the plot into a new direction, and transitions into a new act of the screenplay.

Founded by personnel of the Pacific Fur Company (PFC) in 1812, it was an important source of beaver pelts and venison for the short lived American enterprise in the Pacific Northwest. Isolated in the War of 1812, the real possibility of the Royal Navy or their North West Company (NWC) competitors attacking Fort Astoria motivated the PFC management to sell its holdings and assets to the NWC in late 1813. Wallace House was utilized by the NWC until 1814, when they abandoned it in favor of the nearby Willamette Trading Post. Background Starting with the arrival of the Tonquin and foundation of Fort Astoria in March 1811, the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC) gradually established a commercial presence along the Columbia River. The primary product sought by the company for sale in the Qing Empire were the fur pelts of the North American beaver. After the initial work was finished on Fort Astoria, additional trade posts were ordered to be established throughout the Pacific Northwest. At the time, the Willamette Valley had a sizable population of beaver, making it a suitable location for a secondary station. Establishment On November 23, 1812, William Wallace and John C. Halsley led fourteen men from Fort Astoria to the valley to find a suitable area for a trading post. The party wintered there after completed the building, trapping beaver, hunting game and trading with the resident Kalapuyan nations. A fellow band of PFC employees under Donald Mackenzie came from the interior back to Fort Astoria during the winter. The returned trappers proved to be taxing on Astoria's small food supplies so some of the men were ordered to the Wallace House. Alfred Seton led the designated men there, calling the location a \\"great prairie\\" with large populations of Elk, Columbian white-tailed deer and Black-tailed deer in nearby areas. Halsley, Wallace and their returned to Fort Astoria on May 25, 1813 with a sizable supply of venison, a critical food supply that was sorely needed. More commercially important, however, was an inventory of 775 beaver furs captured over the previous winter. North West Company The War of 1812 led to the complete isolation of the Pacific Fur Company. Their commercial rivals, the North West Company (NWC), based at their New Caledonian posts such as Fort St. James in the interior of modern British Columbia. To avoid conflict against the Royal Navy, the company officers agreed to sell its assets to the North West Company in 1813. Throughout 1813 and 1814, trappers who operated out of Wallace House included Thomas McKay, √âtienne Lucier, Alexander Ross and Donald McKenzie. A new establishment nearby, the Willamette Trading Post, gradually replaced the Wallace House in importance. Three Americans stationed at the latter location relocated to Wallace House for the majority of January 1814. Despite only having six traps, the men were able to gather 80 beaver skins. The post was abandoned after that season, with no record of it until 1832, when Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth depicted it on a map of the Willamette Valley. In the early 1840s, the Methodist Mission in Oregon began work on the Oregon Institute in vicinity of where Wallace House was located.

They are governed by the Basic Laws, the Hours of Work and Rest Law, as well as various other laws, statutes, and regulations. Unions Labor unions are legal in Israel, and about one-third of the workforce is unionized. The Histadrut, a large federation of trade unions, has a prominent place in Israel's economy and society. Workers in most industries have a right to strike provided a fifteen-day notice of intention to strike is given. It is illegal to fire a worker for unionizing and participating in union activities, including strikes. However, the right to strike is restricted in the civil service and in institutions considered vital such as medicine, water, energy, and the police force. Israeli labor courts are tasked with settling labor disputes. There are five regional labor courts which handle local disputes, and the National Labor Court in Jerusalem, which handles nationwide strikes, collective disputes, and appeals of decisions of the regional courts.National Labour Law Profile: The State of Israelhttp://www.ima.org.il/ENG/ViewCategory.aspx?CategoryId=6137 = History of Collective Bargaining = Wage bargaining in Israel has changed from a very centralized corporatist system that collectively represented almost all workers, to a decentralized, pluralist, system with many wage agreements in different sectors of labor. Until the 1990s, bargaining was negotiated between the Private Employers' Association representing businesses and the Histadrut representing the labor force. The state's role in these negotiations was unofficial and its main purpose was to promulgate the new agreements to the people. Negotiations over wages were conducted at the statewide level, determining standard pay across whole sectors of industry. Due to a decrease in both union and employer association memberships, it has been harder to collectivize workers across labor sectors. This decentralization is also attributed to the rise of unions outside the traditional Histadrut, or General Federation of Trade Unions, which had previously not been allowed under the laws of the more corporatist system. = Israel's Labor Evolution = Israel's history, and its changes from corporatist to pluralist exhibit its position as a unique type of economy. Coordination between the government, labor, and employers in regard to how wages are set show its distinction from liberal economies like the United States. The massive influence of the Histadrut in the mid to late 20th century shows a very centralized government who allowed high levels of corporatism with the state's largest labor union in administering public health care and public pension funds. With the state- owned military equipment industry replacing more traditional job sectors like agriculture in the 1980s, Israel progressed into a more industrial economy. It is only in the past few decades, as large-scale industrial work has seen a decline, and service sector jobs have increased, that the Histadrut has lost power. In the 1990s former soviet scientists came to Israel and helped the country further its diversity of exports in order to become a more competitive country in the world economy. In the 21st century, Israel has shown itself to have great potential from its younger generation as it achieved the 2nd highest rate of 25-64 year olds who had achieved tertiary education. This new younger generation may prove to change Israel's labor system and further bring it into a more service-sector oriented world. Workweek and hours Israeli law sets out a 43-hour workweek. This is being reduced to 42 hours as of April 1, 2018. For those with a five-day workweek, the length of a work day is set out as 8.6 hours, while those with a six-day workweek have a work day of 8 hours, with a half-day of work on Friday. Those with a work day of at least six hours are entitled to 45 minutes of rest, including an uninterrupted 30-minute break, although with a special permit those working in non-manual jobs can have full workdays without breaks. However, in practice, additional time is added to make up for these breaks, leading to a maximum 45-hour workweek. As a result, many employees in Israel work 45 hours a week, or 9 hours a day for 5 days. Any work beyond these hours is considered overtime. Overtime work is illegal unless a permit is obtained from the Ministry of Labor, and is subject to certain conditions. The first two hours of overtime must be compensated by a 125% wage raise, and any overtime work beyond that must be accompanied by a 150% raise. No more than four hours of overtime work can be performed in a single day. Those with a six-day workweek cannot work more than 12 hours of overtime per week, while those with a five-day workweek cannot work more than 15 hours of overtime per week. Those who work during a religious holiday are entitled to a 150% raise and an alternative day off.Working Conditions Justlanded.comIsrael Overtime Rates: anglo- list.comSalary, Benefits, and Working Conditions.

Employers are prohibited by law from compelling their employees to work more than 47 hours per week.Sanbar, Moshe: Economic and Social Policy in Israel: The First Generation, p. 228 Discrimination Discrimination over race, religion, age, sexual preference, or disability is banned. It is also illegal to fire a pregnant employee unless the employer can satisfy the Ministry of Labor that the reasons for termination are unrelated to the pregnancy. Employers other than government security bodies and those providing services to children or the mentally or physically disabled are prohibited by law from conducting criminal background checks of job candidates. Leave entitlements All Israeli workers are entitled to a weekly consecutive rest period of at least 36 hours, although with a special permit from the Ministry of Labor, it can be reduced to a minimum of 25 hours. Israelis typically follow a Sunday-Thursday five-day workweek, although some have a Sunday-Friday six-day work week with a half-day on Friday. This is done to accommodate the Jewish Sabbath and Muslim Jumu'ah. All Israeli employees with a five-day workweek are entitled to a minimum of 12 paid vacation days for the first four years of employment, while those with a six-day workweek are entitled to 14 days. This gradually increases after four years to a maximum of 28 days.http://www.mintus-law.co.il/?p=14053‚ü®=en There are also 9 paid public holidays, including a continuous two-day one. Workers are also entitled to 18 days of paid sick leave per year,Sick Days (Right). Kolzchut.org.il and a female employee who has worked for the same employer for one year is entitled to 26 weeks of maternity leave, although she can divide it with the father, and those on parental leave are entitled to an allowance from the government for the first 14 weeks. It is illegal to fire someone on maternity leave or within 60 days after its conclusion.Maternity Leave (Right). Kolzchut.org.il = Labor Rights for Migrants = There are high levels of immigrants in Israel's workforce, with most being authorized immigrants and a smaller percentage being unauthorized. By 1999, when immigrants made up 16% of the full-time labor force, they made up an even higher 27% of part-time labor. More recently in 2001, of the total 2,500,000 workers in the labor force, about 200,000 are immigrants. These migrant workers usually take low-paying jobs in the private sector, where they can be exploited without adequate protection from labor laws The inclusion of migrant workers in the labor force limit the bargaining power of Israeli workers for higher wages, as they tend to take low-paying part-time jobs which are outside collective bargaining agreements. In 2000, 80.2% of male migrant workers were paid less than minimum wage. In 1991, the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, passed the Foreign Workers‚Äô Law (Unlawful Employment and the Guarantee of Decent Conditions) to protect immigrants from being subject to the market economy without any labor protections. Under the law, employers are required to pay into a fund that provides social benefits for migrant workers. Additionally, in an attempt to protect the wages of all migrant workers, the law advocates for employers to set up collective agreements with their workers, similar to how Israel's large private sector has been coordinated.

This Buddha carving was not known to the world until the beginning of the 20th century due to its remote location. In 1906 the Scottish traveller Ella Christie wrote a book on her journey to Western Tibet and featured the carving in her book which gave it international attention. Since then the government has taken many steps to preserve this monument and it is visited by tourists who visit the Skardu city.

Rolling Stone Magazine selected Carousel as one of the \\"40 Best Country and Americana Albums of 2018\\".  History  Carson McHone is a singer-songwriter from Austin. In describing her music, Nashville Scene Magazine says ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a young country singer who expresses herself through the form while avoiding the formalism that etiolates the work of many country purists.\\" She released her 1st recording ‚Äì the self-titled EP ‚ÄúCarson McHone‚Äù in 2013. She played the South By Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas for the 1st time that year. Shortly after that, she received an invitation to join the inaugural class of Project ATX6, which helped bring six Austin musicians to the NXNE (North By Northeast) Festival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and the Reeperbahn Festival in Hamburg, Germany. In 2015, McHone released her first full-length album ‚Äì ‚ÄúGoodluck Man‚Äù. Austin360 Magazine called it an ‚Äúauspicious coming-out for one of the city‚Äôs most promising young singer-songwriters.‚Äù McHone performed at the Americana Music Festival in Nashville, Tennessee in September 2016.

In September 2018, McHone performed at the Americana Music Festival in Nashville, Tennessee In their review of her performance, Nowitsnashville magazine said ‚ÄúShe possesses an beguiling wistfulness in slower songs that place her in a unique arena of Americana, but can present the same tongue in cheek observations that make country music so fun.‚Äù In August 2018 through October 2018, McHone released four singles from her upcoming album ‚Äì Carousel. On August 23, 2018, McHone released ‚ÄúSad‚Äù as its first single. Rolling Stone selected it as 1 of the ‚Äú10 Best Country and Americana Songs of the Week‚Äù. In their review, they said ‚Äúit‚Äôs driven along by fiddle and electric guitar ‚Äî gleefully speeding up and slowing down at its own pace. Filled with self-aware lyrics about McHone‚Äôs history of heartbreak, this is the sound of an artist making peace with her own unrest.\\" Wide Open Country Magazine says \\"Sad starts off with a meandering sway with callbacks to ‚ÄúTennessee Whiskey‚Äù before breaking off into a rolling mid-tempo gust. Though it's filled with rakes of fiddle and warbling pedal steel, it remains uncluttered as it punches along.\\" American Songwriter Magazine described it as ‚Äúa mid-tempo honky-tonk number built on pedal steel, fiddle, and a self-aware take on the hard luck heartbreak that often finds its way into such songs.‚Äù On September 25, 2018 Wide Open Country magazine named the upcoming Carousel as one of the ‚ÄúCountry and Americana albums you need to hear this fall‚Äù. On September 19, 2018 McHone released a cover of the Uncle Walt's Band song ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt You Think I Feel It Too‚Äù, which was written by David Ball.

In describing it, they said, ‚ÄúNot all ‚Äúdone-me-wrong‚Äù country songs are slow, sad ballads as McHone proves with \\"Good Time Daddy Blues,\\" a country-shuffle that chronicles the end of a relationship with confidence (and a healthy side of anger).‚Äù On October 28, 2018 McHone released another single - ‚ÄúDrugs‚Äù. It premiered in Ladygunn Magazine where they said ‚ÄúIt sounds like the warmth of a vintage record playing through mahogany speakers‚Äù On October 26, 2018, McHone released her second full- length album ‚Äì Carousel on Nine Mile Records. The album was recorded in Nashville and produced by Mike McCarthy, best known for his work with Spoon and Patty Griffin. In their October 29, 2018 review of Carousel, Saving Country Music Magazine says \\"it takes you on an emotional ride. It‚Äôs not just the words, but the music on Carousel that help create an audio illustration of the emotional battlefields we all face that it‚Äôs haunting at times in how well it mirrors our own experiences.\\" In October 2018 McHone had several shows in Los Angeles, California. In November 2018, McHone toured throughout the Midwest and East Coast of the United States in support of Carousel. On November 29, 2018, the video for ‚ÄúSad‚Äù was released in Line of Best Fit magazine. Where they said, \\"‚ÄúSad‚Äù epitomizes McHone's off-centre, oddball take on traditional country.

In December 2018, Rolling Stone magazine selected Carousel as one of the \\"40 Best Country and Americana Albums of 2018\\". Saying \\"There‚Äôs a delightful sense of traditionalism within the melodies of Carousel, but she never feels bound to it either. Like on the bare-bones, Gillian Welch-evoking ‚ÄúSpider Song,‚Äù which closes the record, McHone knows it's the words that matter just as much as the packaging.\\" Loose Records in the UK signed McHone after her performance at the Americana Music Festival in Nashville, Tennessee in September 2018. Carousel was released in the UK on January 25th, 2019. On January 29th, 2019 McHone performed at the AmericanaFest UK in London.

A couple of years after his baptism his Godfather, Peter, Duke of Holstein- Gottorp, became (for just six months, during 1762) the Tsar of Russia. Poel was born in Russia, but his father had been born in the Netherlands, and at the time of his baptism his first name is thought to have been spelled in family and church records as \\"Pieter\\" or \\"Petrus\\". Sources also sometimes identify him as Peter Poel. Life=Family provenance= Piter Poel was born in Arkhangelsk, where his father, Jacobus \\"Jan\\" Poel, had been sent by Rutger van Brienen to set up a northern branch of the St. Petersburg based van Brienen trading company. Rutger van Brienen was both the business partner and the father-in-law of Jan Poel, who had married, as his second wife, Magdalena van Brienen around 1750. Piter was his parents' fourth recorded child, and his father's sixth recorded child. Sources comment admiringly on Jan Poel's ability as a linguist: he had undergone a commercial training in Leiden and was fluent in Dutch, Russian and German. The Poel family connection with St. Petersburg dated back at least to the time of Pieter's grandfather, another Jacobus \\"Jan\\" Poel/Pool (1682-?), the son of an Amsterdam boat builder who had emigrated during the first part of the eighteenth century and become a \\"ship builder to the tsars\\". =Early years= The first three years of Pieter Poel's life were eventful. At the time of his birth his father had befriended Peter, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, a grandson of Peter the Great. The Duke had been born in Kiel and spoke very little Russian which explains why he drew his friends from St. Petersburg's German expatriate community. It was a mark of the friendship between the Dutch born merchant and the future Tsar that the Duke became Piter Poel's Godfather (\\"Patenonkel\\"). In January 1762 the Russian Empress died and her nephew, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, became Tsar Peter III. The new Tsar now invited his friend, Jan Poel, to look after his estates in southern Holstein, and to supervise his pet project there, which involved the construction of a canal. Jan Poel accordingly travelled to Holstein and took up his new duties. A few weeks later the new Tsar was assassinated. His widow, remembered in history as Catherine the Great, spent the next 34 years building up Russia and denigrating the reputation of her late husband. Following the death of his friend, the Tsar, Jan Poel hurriedly closed down his business activities in Arkhangelsk and moved his young family to Hamburg where he had contacts in the merchant community. The year after the move, on 8 October 1763, Magdalena Poel, Pieter's mother, died at Hamburg. Between the ages of 3 and 6 Pieter Poel was brought up at an orphanage/boarding school together with his sister Magdalena, who was three years older than he was. Between the ages of 6 and 15 he was educated at a boys' boarding school. His childhood therefore gave him very little experience of family life. =Apprenticeship and university= Jan Poel died in 1775 and left Piter a sufficient inheritance to allow him some independence and to fund a university education. From 1776 till 1778 he undertook a commercial apprenticeship with a company in Bordeaux, which he later described as one of Europe's dirtiest cities (\\"verderbsten St√§dte\\"). At Bordeaux he mastered the French language and developed an affection for French theatre. Piter then lived for a couple of years in Geneva where he studied intensively in order to prepare for an application to a German university, before moving to G√∂ttingen where in November 1780 he enrolled at the University for a period of study that covered History, Statecraft and Social economics, with the intention of undertaking a career as a diplomat. His lecturers included Ludwig Timotheus Spittler. He was encouraged in his pursuit of a university education by his sister Magdalena, who herself had been in a somewhat restless marriage with Adrian Wilhelm Pauli, another member of the Hamburg merchant class, since 1776. While at G√∂ttingen he became a member of the influential \\"ZN\\" Student fraternity in 1781, as he would much later recall in his memoirs. Poel made full use of the networking opportunities that the fraternity membership provided. =St. Petersburg and Stockholm= At the end of the summer term he left G√∂ttingen and headed for St. Petersburg, where his maternal uncle, Abraham van Brienen, was widely considered to have become a man of great influence in both the commercial and political worlds: while in St. Petersburg Poel was able to get to know some of his uncle's contacts. During 1783 and 1784 he was employed with the rank of Captain as a secretary and interpreter at the College of Foreign Affairs (Foreign Ministry) in St. Petersburg. His uncle had promised to get him a position in the Russian diplomatic service, but towards the end of 1784 Poel gave up on the idea of a diplomatic career with the Russians and moved to Sweden, where he tried to obtain a position in public service. Despite his good contacts in the business world, no suitable government job was forthcoming, however. There are suggestions that his adherence to a reformed version of the Protestant faith may have counted against him with the resolutely Lutheran political establishment in Stockholm. Uppsala University Archive (F 491, Gustavianska saml. Quart 17 Nr. 121 - exchange of correspondence between Piter Poel and senior Swedish government ministers) =Settling in Hamburg and Altona= In 1785 Piter Poel moved to Hamburg where he developed a close friendship with merchant Caspar Voght. Early 1786 the two of them set out on an extended business trip, taking in Paris and London. Poel would remain on good terms with Voght for the rest of his life. In 1789 Poel moved house again, relocating to Altona. In 1938 Altona became a western suburb of Hamburg, but in 1789 it was not merely a separate municipality, but part of a different jurisdiction, the Duchy of Holstein. Since 1773 the title \\"Duke of Holstein-Gottorp\\" had been conferred on the Russian Tsars purely as a titular courtesy, following a land swap with Denmark that also involved the Duchy of Oldenburg. Piter Pohl now lived in Altona for nearly fifty years, and it is where he would die in 1837. Friendship with Caspar Voght opened many doors for Piter Pohl. He joined a social circle that also included the pioneering physician Johann Reimarus and the merchant Georg Heinrich Sieveking. Another member of the circle was the mathematics guru and creator of the Hamburg Trade Academy, Johann Georg B√ºsch. In 1787 Piter Poel married B√ºsch's daughter, Friedericke Elisabeth (1768 - 1821). The marriage was a happy one and resulted in eleven recorded children. In Altona he acquired the right to publish the venerable \\"Altonaische Mercurius\\" (newspaper), while not dictating editorial policy of what was, in its day, one of the most influential German-language newspapers in northern Europe. In Altona Piter Poel also undertook work as a journalist and writer. In 1793 Poel joined with two of his friends to buy a country house beside the Elbe at Neum√ºhlen, a half hour walk to the west of his town house in Altona's Gro√üe Freiheit (street). The other purchasers were the merchant and enlightenment philosopher Georg Heinrich Sieveking (1751-1799) and the banker-merchant (1751-1822). Together the three of them developed the house as a summer residence which quickly became known as a meeting point for Hamburg's wealthy cosmopolitan elite. The project survived Sieveking's early death in 1799 and Matthiessen's divorce in 1801, but the house at Neum√ºhlen as sold in 1811 and Poel set up a home in Teufelsbr√ºck a few hundred meters further downstream. Between 1816 and 1822 he lived together with Caspar Voght at house in Flottbek, another settlement on the western fringe of Altona, and it was here that on 18 October 1821 his wife died following a two-day illness. After the same of the Neum√ºhlen house, his subsequent homes continued to provide a social hub for the Hamburg elite, with Poel himself at the heart of things. Four years after he was widowed his elder sister Magdalena, with whom he had always been close, fell ill and he rushed to her home in B√ºckeburg to take his leave of her, but arrived too late. Seven of his eleven children had lived into adulthood, and Piter Poel now withdrew increasingly into private life, while still sustaining friendships, notably with Caspar Voght and the Danish diplomat Johann Georg Rist who lived in Altona between 1815 and 1834. =Literary legacy= During this period he began to work on his memoirs, covering the years up to the outbreak of the French Revolution. He insisted that these were not intended for publication despite the promptings of \\"insightful\\" friends. A couple of years before his death, in 1835 he agreed to the publication of fragments of his memoirs, notably in the \\"Altonaer Merkur\\" (newspaper). He also published a lengthy work on the reoccupation of Hamburg by the French in 1813, which was published under the title \\"Hamburgs Untergang\\". Much later his son Gustav Poel (1804-1895) published various of his father's papers under the title \\"Bilder aus vergangener Zeit\\".

He is known to be the first to purify a protein kinase C activity from plants and is credited with the identification of topoisomerase as a substrate of protein kinase C. He is an elected Fellow of several major Indian science academies and The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) and is a recipient of many honours, including the 1987 Shanti Swarup Bhatangar Prize, the highest Indian award in the science and technology categories. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2007, for his contributions to science and technology.  Biography  Born on 7 January 1948, Sopory secured his graduate degree (BSc) in 1966 and postgraduate degree (MSc) in 1968 from Sri Pratap College, Sri Nagar of the University of Kashmir. Subsequently, he moved to Delhi to start his career by joining University of Delhi as a member of faculty and pursued his doctoral studies there to obtain a PhD in plant molecular biology in 1973. After securing the doctoral degree, he joined Jawaharlal Nehru University in 1973 as an assistant professor and worked there till his superannuation in 1996, holding positions such as associate professor (1978‚Äì1984), professor (1985‚Äì1996) and Hostel warden. In between, he worked at various overseas educational institutions; Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, (1976‚Äì1978), University of Texas at their Department of Botany as a visiting Fulbright fellow (1981‚Äì1982), USDA Plant Molecular Biology Laboratory, Maryland and University of Munich as a visiting Humboldt Professor (1991‚Äì1992). After his superannuation, he joined International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) New Delhi, as a group leader of research in plant molecular biology in 1997, and became the interim director of the institution in 2010. In 2011, he was appointed as the vice chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, a post he held till 13 January 2016).  Legacy  During his researches at Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Sopory developed a plant breeding methodology to produce monohaploids of potato, in 1978. His researches at University of Texas assisted in the discovery of the \\"role of calcium and calmodulin\\" in higher plants and, while in Maryland, he worked on D1 protein to find the mechanism behind it. In the early Nineties, he worked under R. Hermann on promoter analysis of light regulated genes encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis. His researches on the gene expression and the activity of nitrate reductase revealed the effect of light on the turnover of phosphoinositide cycle. This helped explain light signal transduction in plants. Sopory is reported to be the first to purify a Protein Kinase C from plants and he has been successful in identifying topoisomerase I as a substrate of Protein Kinase C in plants. Based on his work on dehydration stress and salinity-related gene regulation, he is known to have developed a new methodology for gene amplification and a Polymerase chain reaction-based protocol for manipulating differentially-expressed genes and their promoters. Working on rice (Oryza sativa) and Pennisetum, he evolved new methodologies for producing stress tolerant transgenic plants. His researches on glyoxalase system in plants explained how it affected the stress environment and he propounded a process how transgenic plants capable of growing in conditions of high salinity could be developed by manipulating glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II, two enzymes related to the detoxification of methylglyoxal, the organic compound known to increase the level of stress response of plants. Sopory's researches have been documented in over 250 articles published in peer reviewed journals; ResearchGate, an online repository of science articles have listed 242 of them. He has been the editor of 13 books on the subject and has contributed 53 chapters to books written/edited by others besides co-authoring the Hostel Manual for Jawaharlal Nehru University. He is the president of the Indian Society of Plant Physiology and the vice president of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Allahabad. He has served as the vice president of such organizations as Indian Society for Plant Physiology and Biochemistry (2001‚Äì2003), Indian National Science Academy (2004‚Äì2006) and the Society for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology, New Delhi (2009‚Äì2011) and is a former secretary of the Plant Tissue Culture Association of India (2001‚Äì2010). During his stint as the vice chancellor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, the institution is reported to have acquired a new 1000-acre campus in South Delhi. The university started new doctoral research courses in Energy studies, Human rights, Silk Route studies, Climate change and Biotechnology and inaugurated a new website and a cyber library during this period. He has also mentored many students in their doctoral studies.  Awards and honours  Four of the major Indian science academies have elected Sopory as their fellow; The Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS) in 1992, National Academy of Sciences, India (NASI) in 1993, the Indian National Science Academy (INSA) the next year, and the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS) in 2002. The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) followed suit in 2005. He has delivered many notable award lectures such as Gadgil Memorial Award Lecture (2000) of the Plant Tissue Culture Association, P.

In 1995 he was rated the best juvenile colt of his generation in Japan when he won three of his four races including the Grade I Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes. In the following spring he won the Spring Stakes and then returned from a lengthy injury absence to win the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho. In 1997 he added wins in the Naruo Kinen and the Mainichi Okan before being retired to stud at the end of the season. Apart from his wins he finished second in the Takarazuka Kinen and third in the Japan Cup. He had modest success as a breeding stallion in Japan and Australia before dying in 2010 at the age of seventeen. Background Bubble Gum Fellow was a bay horse with a narrow white blaze bred by Shadai Farm, the breeding operation of his owners Shadai Racehorse Co Ltd. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Sunday Silence, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby, before retiring to stud in Japan where he was champion sire on thirteen consecutive occasions. His other major winners included Deep Impact, Stay Gold, Heart's Cry, Manhattan Cafe, Zenno Rob Roy and Neo Universe. His dam Bubble Company won one race in France before becoming a broodmare. She also produced Bubble Prospector, whose descendants have included Deep Brillante (Tokyo Yushun) and That's The Plenty (Kikuka Sho). The colt was sent into training with Kazuo Fujisawa. Racing career=1995: two-year-old season= Bubble Gum Fellow made his racecourse debut by finishing third to Abiru Sun God in a maiden race over 1800 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 7 October and then won a similar event over the same course and distance three weeks later. In the Fuchu Sansai Stakes (again over 1800 metres at Tokyo) on 19 November he recorded his second victory, beating Sakura Speed and ten others. On his final start of the year, the colt was moved up in class but down in distance for the Grade I Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes over 1600 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 7 December. Ridden by Yukio Okabe, he won by three quarters of a length from Eishin Guymon with a gap of two and a half lengths back to Generalist in third. In January 1996, Bubble Gum Fellow was voted Best Two-Year-Old Colt in the JRA Awards for 1995. =1996: three-year-old season= Bubble Gum Fellow began his second season in the Grade II Fuji TV Sho Spring Stakes (a major trial for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres at Nakayama on 24 March and won from Cheers Silence and Cash Lavora. The colt then suffered from a serious injury to his right hind leg and was of the racecourse for five months. In his absence Ishino Sunday won the Satsuki Sho, whilst the Tokyo Yushun fell to Fusaichi Concorde. Bubble Gum Fellow eventually returned for the Grade II Mainichi Okan at Tokyo on 6 October, a race which saw him matched against older horses for the first time. He finished third of the twelve runners behind the British-trained four-year- old Annus Mirabilis and the six-year-old Toyo Lyphard. Three weeks later the colt was one of seventeen horses to contest the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho over 2000 metres at Tokyo. His opponents included Mayano Top Gun (Kikuka Sho, Arima Kinen, Takarazuka Kinen, Tenno Sho (spring)), Genuine (Satsuki Sho, Mile Championship), Marvelous Sunday (Takarazuka Kinen) and Sakura Laurel (Tenno Sho (spring), Arima Kinen). Ridden by Masayoshi Ebina Bubble Gum Fellow got the best of a closely contested finish, winning by half a length, a neck and a head from Mayano Top Gun, Sakura Laurel and Marvelous Sunday. On his final race as a three-year-old, Bubble Gum Fellow started second favourite behind Helissio of the Japan Cup on 24 November but after reaching seventh place in the straight he quickly faded and finished thirteenth of the fifteen runners behind Singspiel. =1997: four-year-old season= Bubble Gum Fellow began his third season in the Grade II Naruo Kinen over 2000 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 15 June and won from Tokai Taro and Dance Partner (Yushun Himba, Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup). At the same track in July he contested the Grade I Takarazuka Kinen and was beaten a neck into second by Marvelous Sunday with Dance Partner in third. As in 1996, Bubble Gum Fellow began his autumn campaign in the Mainichi Okan and won from Tsukuba Symphony and Speed World. He then attempted to repeat his previous success in the Tenno Sho but was beaten a neck by the four-year-old filly Air Groove with a gap of five lengths back to Genuine in third. On 23 November, Bubble Gum Fellow started 2.7/1 favourite in a fourteen-runner field for the xth running of the Japan Cup. Ridden by Okabe, he turned into the straight in fifth place and made steady progress in the closing stages to finish third behind Pilsudski and Air Groove. Stud record Bubble Gum Fellow was retired to become a breeding stallion in Japan and was also shuttled to stand for part of the year in Australia. The best of his offspring included the Graded race winners Appare Appare, Candy Vale (Sunline Stakes), Toshi Candy, Early Robusto, Onoyu and Meiner Bowknot. He died of pneumonia on 26 April 2010 at the age of seventeen.

Born in Mosul in the late 13th century, he was active in Jazƒ´rat Ibn  øUmar on the upper Tigris in the early 14th century, and in Famagusta, Cyprus, in the 1330s.

Ibn Yuhanna's \\"Book of Secrets\\" opens with a letter addressed to the Christians in the \\"West\\" (Byzantine Empire), defending the authenticity of the Church of the East and making a plea for Christian unity. It is plausible that ibn Yuhanna was already in Cyprus, at the time still a crusader kingdom (under king Hugh IV) when he completed this work.

Its platform includes an optimisation engine, traveller app, driver app and client portal. The traveller app allows passengers to book, pay and track a service between two locations within a service area. The optimisation engine consumes pre-planned and real-time bookings and then allocates passengers to the available vehicles to create the optimal trips for the given service objectives. The optimisation engine is designed to handle large numbers of passengers and vehicles of both small capacities (1-6 pax) and high capacity (6-50+). BRIDJ technology is currently deployed on public transport services in Sydney, Australia and for staff transfer services Singapore. It initially provided shuttle services in its origin city of Boston and later also in Washington DC and Kansas City. These American services ceased operation in April 2017 following an unsuccessful funding round. The business was then acquired by Australian company Transit Systems and services started in Sydney in December 2017. In January 2020, Transit Systems was acquired by SeaLink Travel Group. As a result of this transaction, BRIDJ became an independent, privately owned company. After acquiring and managing the business on behalf of Transit Systems, John Langford-Ely is now the CEO of the independent company. History=USA (2014 - 2017)= Founded early in 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts by Matt George, the company launched in their home town later the same year followed by Washington DC in April 2015. The company raised $4 million from a number of venture capital firms and an early investor in Zipcar. On 10 February 2016, BRIDJ and the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) announced \\"Ride KC: BRIDJ\\", a pilot project that would use BRIDJ as the operator of a microtransit system under the RideKC brand. Though BRIDJ planned trips based on users preferences expressed via its mobile app, KCATA provided union drivers and set fares the same as its other service. Fourteen Ford Transit vehicles were used in an exclusivity deal.https://gizmodo.com/ford-and-bridj-are-launching-an-on-demand-bus- service-i-1758448851 Later in 2016, BRIDJ ceased operations in Washington DC. It also began using its buses and local storage lockers to deliver goods in Boston on a trial basis, while considering future self-driving buses and sidewalk-traveling robots to deliver packages. BRIDJ shut down abruptly on 30 April 2017, after funding negotiations with Toyota failed. George told The Boston Globe in May 2017, that the company raised approximately $11 million since their founding in June 2014. =Australia (2017 onwards)= In October 2017 it was announced that BRIDJ had been purchased by Australian company Transit Systems. It began operations in Sydney, Australia with a trial Wetherill Park On Demand service in December 2017 operating Iveco Dailys. In August 2018, it took over the Eastern Suburbs On Demand service from Transdev's RIDE Plus, while the Wetherill Park trial service ceased operations. In July 2018, BRIDJ‚Äôs parent company Transit Systems commenced the Region 6 bus services contract in Inner-West Sydney by Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW). This is an 8-year contract with a fleet of approx 600 buses servicing over 50 million passengers per annum. The contract was awarded with an integrated DRT/On Demand component that will see up to 10 DRT/On Demand zones being implemented over time in conjunction with the broader network improvement plan in the Inner West of Sydney. The Burwood and Strathfield Train Station Service represents one of these zones and operates using 18 seat Hino mini-buses. The Region 6 strategic network plan involves BRIDJ services being introduced as feeder services into trunk transport hubs and also more efficient coverage services to fill network gaps. By doing so, it is envisaged that BRIDJ can provide a more efficient and customer friendly ‚Äòfirst and last mile‚Äô public transport service, while at the same time facilitating upgrades on the trunk bus network to ‚Äòturn-up-and-go‚Äô style services (i.e. reallocation of large bus resources to trunk corridors with headway frequency). Transit Systems plans to introduce more BRIDJ on-demand services into other Australian cities as well as London.Transit Systems eyes Bridj shuttle expansion after Adelaide bus acquisition Australian Financial Review 9 May 2018 In January 2020, SeaLink Travel Group acquired Transit Systems. As part of the acquisition, BRIDJ became privately owned and now operates independently. BRIDJ plans to partner with new operators and transit agencies across the globe. = Singapore (2019 onwards) = In Singapore, BRIDJ licenses its technology to Tower Transit for the purpose of transferring drivers to and from its Bulim depot. Historically, these services were delivered using fixed routes. Using the BRIDJ platform, Tower Transit has converted these services into dynamic ones that adapt to the transport requirements of drivers working on any given day. Operations= Sydney Inner West = BRIDJ operates On Demand services on behalf of Transit Systems for Transport for New South Wales in Sydney's Inner West. The service was the first On Demand service in Sydney to accept OpalPay and concession fares. BRIDJ formerly operated trials in Wetherill Park and a Rose Bay to Bondi service, until they ceased operations on 3 August 2018. and 20 December 2019 respectively.

Plot  Stranded Deep takes place in the Pacific Ocean, where a plane crash survivor finds themselves faced with some of the most life-threatening scenarios in a procedurally generated world. Players are able to explore Pacific islands, reefs, and bottomless ocean trenches filled with detailed biomes, and need to search for and develop the means to survive.  Gameplay  Players are able to explore the environment in Stranded Deep. The game features a dynamic weather and day-night cycle. Also featured is a building system, whereby players are able to settle on an island and construct a shelter or a raft with which to explore the ocean, and a crafting system, whereby resources can be harvested and combined in order to create equipment. Resources are limited, and therefore need to be managed. As supplies that players are able to carry are limited, items need to be prioritized for the task at hand. Players need to manage their vitals of health, hunger, thirst, and sleep, against the elements they face. Thirst is in particular an important component of survival. Hydration sources are scarce, with coconut milk being the most common and easiest to obtain water substitute. The player can eventually craft a water collector, which will produce water over time from the evaporation of palm leaves. Hunger is another challenge, although not as serious. Food can be obtained from many sources, including coconuts, fishing, and rations. Players are also able to search sunken shipwrecks and islands for interesting and rare equipment. The tropical ocean in the game is full of different life forms. This ranges from small fish, sea turtles, rays, lionfish, sea snakes, crown-of-thorns starfish, swordfish, whales, as well as the most dangerous enemies in the game - sharks. There are different types of sharks, some being harmless, while others are life threatening, like the Great Whites. Sharks can directly attack the player, or they can also bump into the player‚Äôs raft, potentially flipping it over. There are also three sea monsters found in specific places in the world - a Megalodon shark, a giant squid, and a giant eel. Each one, when killed, gives the player a trophy as a reward for killing it. They are considered the most challenging enemies in the game. As the player‚Äôs plane crashes into the ocean, they are saved via an inflatable lifeboat found nearby. The lifeboat is equipped with a pouch containing a compass, as well as rations that the player can use. The lifeboat can also be used as a raft to flow between different islands. A key feature of rafts is anchoring them. This is because rafts can be carried into the open ocean by currents or storms if not anchored, or dragged onto land. The player can collect components and materials later to craft their own raft. These rafts can differ in base, floor, and the propeller. Apart from rafts, the only other form of transportation is a gyrocopter, which can be created when the necessary components are found first. The game also features an official ending. The player can find an abandoned aircraft carrier, stranded on a small island. On the ship, there is a plane, which when repaired can serve as an escape from the Pacific. In the game, the player can also find easter eggs associated with the 2000 movie Cast Away. On one of the islands, there is a volleyball with a bloody handprint on it, called ‚Äò‚ÄôWollie‚Äô‚Äô, similar to ‚Äò‚ÄôWilson‚Äô‚Äô from the movie. There is also a mail box washed on an island, loosely resembling the FedEx box from Cast Away. Since the world of the game is procedurally generated, the initial island that the player lands on, as well as all the other islands, are randomly generated for each save file played. The game also features a ‚Äúcartographer‚Äù mode, where the player can manipulate their world, as well as add and customize existing and new islands. Release Telltale Games announced that it was to release the game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2018, through its Telltale Publishing label. When Telltale Games announced its majority studio closure in September 2018, Beam Team Games stated that it was doing \\"everything it could\\" to launch the console versions on time. On January 29, 2020, Beam Team Games announced on their Twitter page that Stranded Deep's console release was scheduled to the end of March, but could be delayed until early April instead. On April 21, 2020, the game was officially released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Update History Stranded Deep was released as a full game for consoles only on April 21, 2020. The PC version is still in early access as of 2020. On April 29, 2020, the console versions received update 1.02. The update fixed bugs and glitches, as well as refining some gameplay functions.

By pooling the resources of multinational pharmaceutical, biotechnology companies, academic centers and oncologists, it intends to create access to over 60 novel and approved agents under exploration in the war against cancer and is expected to enable rapid testing of novel immunotherapy combination protocols. The initiative is being managed by a consortium of companies called The National Immunotherapy Coalition. The difficulty of treating cancer has led researchers to develop more and more targeted drugs and immune therapies, with the future goal of hitting \\"cancers with several such treatments at once, much the way AIDS was tamed when researchers developed drugs to strike the virus at its vulnerable points.\\" This new form of combination therapy is needed as cancer is heterogeneous and multiple methods are needed to target multiple types of cancer. Some cancer specialists have expressed optimism that science has entered a \\"new era with the ability to rapidly determine the sequences of genes in tumor cells, searching for mutations that may be driving the cancer‚Äôs growth.\\" Others call it \\"unrealistic.\\"  History  The original Cancer MoonShot 2020 name reportedly came from a speech Vice President Joe Biden made in the Rose Garden in October 2015, promising a \\"moonshot\\" to cure cancer. The speech was said to be triggered by the death of Biden's son Beau to cancer. In February 2017, the organization announced on its Facebook page that it was changing the name to Cancer Breakthroughs 2020, in order to put more focus on \\"significant breakthroughs in molecular science, supercomputing technology, and a willingness across the entire healthcare continuum to change the paradigm for cancer care.\\"  National Immunotherapy Coalition (NIC)  Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 is led by the National Immunotherapy Coalition (NIC), an initiative reportedly led by Los Angeles billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong. Participating members include pharmaceutical companies Amgen and Celgene, biotech companies including NantWorks, NantKwest, Etubics, Altor BioScience, and Precision Biologics, a subsidiary of NantWorks, major academic cancer centers, community oncologists, health insurer Independence Blue Cross, and Bank of America, reportedly one of the largest self-insured companies in the U.S.  Research scope  The scope of the project is to conduct dozens of small-scale clinical trials over the next few years in the field of immunotherapy, with as many as 20,000 patients. These trials are intended to be followed by larger trials. The project's goals will be considered met when long-lasting remission is achieved for cancer patients. = Themes pursued = Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 is pursuing immunotherapy and the following themes: *Validation of Big Science: Complex science involving the human immune system and the validation of the safety and efficacy of combination therapy must be tested by reputable scientific enterprises in an unbiased manner without any prejudices other than the interest of the patient. *Access to novel agents and approved drugs: One of the major challenges facing rapid progress in this field is that numerous pharmaceutical and biotech companies each have their own immunotherapeutic agents in the form of antibodies, immune cells, and vaccines in preclinical and clinical studies. *FDA Regulation: Novel approaches for the adaptive combination of novel agents in this new paradigm where the combined multi-agents serve as a systems biological approach to the treatment of cancer. *Care coordination and real-time monitoring of safety and outcomes with integration of complex molecular data, phenotypic data obtained from disparate electronic records. *Ability to measure outcomes and cost in real time to enable payers to pay for value rather than procedures and establish an adaptive learning system for enhanced predictive modeling. *Network Infrastructure: Highly secure bandwidth to transmit big data and interrogate complex molecular information in a large scale. = QUILT = Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 incorporates a concept called QUILT, which stands for QUantitative Integrative Lifelong Trial. QUILT is designed to leverage patients' immune systems, such as dendritic cell, T cell (lymphocyte) and natural killer cell (NK cell) therapies, and testing a variety of treatments including novel combinations of vaccines, cell-based immunotherapy, metronomic (regularly administered) chemotherapy, low dose radiotherapy and immunomodulators, as well as check point inhibitors, in patients who have undergone next generation whole genome, transcriptome and quantitative proteomic analysis.

Cancer turned out to be not one disease, but hundreds, and the idea of curing cancer once and for all is \\"misleading and outdated.\\"‚ÄòMoonshot‚Äô to Cure Cancer, to Be Led by Biden, Relies on Outmoded View of Disease, By Gina Kolata and Gardiner Harris, New York Times, Jan. 13, 2016 The New York Times reported how Andrew von Eschenbach, director of the National Cancer Institute, announced in 2003 that his goal was to ‚Äúeliminate suffering and death‚Äù caused by cancer by 2015. During an appropriations hearing, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), asked von Eschenbach what it would take to move the date up to 2010. Von Eschenbach said he could do it with a proposed budget of $600 million a year. Specter died of cancer in 2012. In a column in the New York Times, Margot Sanger-Katz wrote, \\"The Breakthroughs metaphor is appealing because it describes a seemingly impossible task that was nevertheless achieved through good old American know-how and lots of federal spending.

It was released on 28 September 2015 for Microsoft Windows.\\"Stairs\\" at GameSpot Stairs is loosely based on the Donner Party. Gameplay The game is played in first person. It makes the player use a camera (along with different sources of light) to navigate around environments and avoid obstacles. The player must use their camera to activate certain doors, interact with certain objects, or move around in certain places. There is also a list of places of interest at each location, which gives the player a rough depiction of their progress. Although no weapons are used, the scarcity of enemies and lack of \\"boss\\" monsters motivate strategy over action. (The camera could be considered a \\"weapon\\" of sorts given the use and role it takes.) Players may crouch to move through small tunnels, or under certain obstacles. This crouch mechanic can also be used if a player wishes to move slower to avoid detection by an enemy or other hazards. Synopsis A journalist investigates the disappearances of three people near an old factory. =Setting= The majority of the game takes place in or around a disused building, presumed to be a factory. Underneath the building is a series of tunnels closely resembling mine shafts. Notes from various deceased people may be picked up and read at any time, some of which give clues as to the player's next goal. The player may use their camera in certain areas to teleport to another, unspecified location, that bears some resemblance to the \\"decaying industry\\" motif that the factory used. After reaching a point in the story, the player instead moves through an abandoned town. Here, three trials, which are located in fixed places on a map, must be completed to progress the game. =Plot= The main character, Christopher Adams, is a freelance journalist who, seeking a new story, investigates the three-year disappearances of three people. The three people are Valarie Burkley, James Reid, and Jon Remens. Adams has heard that Burkley was kidnapped by Reid and Remens, and is presumed dead. No motive is known for the kidnapping, the murder, or the three's sudden disappearance. News of a strangulated female body, presumably Burkley, found inside a nearby factory was discovered by Adams, and he goes to investigate. He enters the factory to quickly find a large underground complex, where he meets Valarie Burkley, who is trapped in a locked room. Adams tries to find clues to discover the combination to a safe which holds the key to the locked room. Upon acquiring most of the clues, however, Valarie is seen hanged in the room, with the remainder of the combination on her clothing, and on the wall behind her body. Throughout the rest of the complex, Valarie follows Adams, manipulating lights, doors, and warning Adams about approaching danger. Stairs leading down to the mine are found at the end of the complex. Within the mine, the player must activate two pumps and enter the pump control room to lower the water level sufficiently to reach an elevator and escape the factory. While doing so, the player comes into contact with humanoid beasts of unspecified origin, which have the potential to kill the player if alerted (such as by contact, loud noise, or by using the camera.) Valarie also attempts to impede the player's progress by patrolling the entrance to one of the pumps, though she can be avoided with relative ease. After the water level lowers, the player finds more stairs which lead further into the mine, where the player must reach the elevator, dodging monsters, and collecting more information about the events leading up to the disappearances. The elevator eventually leads to the surface, after forcing the player to crawl through many corridors filled with subdued creatures. Upon exiting the factory, the player traverses to the nearby town, where the voice of Jon Remens sounds over a speaker system. The player must complete three trials, each involving different elements of previous gameplay in order to be transported to a set of room resembling the mines. It is revealed that the residents of the town were involved in a mass suicide which was spurned on by Remens for unknown reasons. These rooms are filled with the beasts from the factory (albeit in a more docile form), and feature Remens' voice addressing the player constantly. After these trials are over, the player travels through one more hallway which is very similar to those of the instillation, at the end of which Remens accuses Adams of dehumanizing people and \\"making them into monsters.\\" The beasts are most likely the dead residents of the town, in some form or another. It is meant to be gathered that Valarie, as a mental patient, was being cared for by her father, though Adams corrupted that story by implying rape, incest, and other abuse by her father. Reid, meanwhile, was trapped in an underground mine with a group of fellow miners and they desperately searched for a way out to no avail. Adams twisted this by supposing that cannibalism also occurred during the escape attempt. Remens took a group of terminal cancer patients away into the woods to live off their days in peace apart from the rest of society. He then suggested suicide to the group as a means of dying on their own terms, an idea which they obviously adopted. Adams, however, called Remens a dangerous cult leader who forced his group into killing themselves. Many clones of Valarie, all in different poses, surround the player at the end of the hallway, where a door can be found. Another set of stairs is found behind, and the game ends. References to the Donner Party (specifically cannibalism) and Jonestown (with John Remens standing in for Jim Jones) are prevalent throughout the game.

Honours *Lancashire County Cup: 2 **1923-24, 1930‚Äì31 *Lancashire League: 1 **1926-27 History The club was founded in 1878 as part of the sports and recreational provision of Pilkington Glass. Initially the side played rugby union, and sometimes association football. However, on 14 June 1913, to settle the future of the club, it was announced that it was to abandon association football to concentrate on rugby football. After considerable discussion, it was unanimously agreed to join the constitution of the Northern Rugby Football Union (later the Rugby Football League). The Recs, still officially known as the St Helens Recs, were based at City Road and played their first game on 6 September 1913. To bolster the ranks of the war time league, St Helens Recreation along with Brighouse Rangers and Featherstone Rovers were promoted from district leagues to join the senior clubs for the duration of the conflict. St Helens now had two professional rugby clubs, with the St Helens R.F.C. being the other professional club. During the 1920s, and 1930s, the Recs played at every level of competition, hosting visiting Australian touring sides and gaining honours in the game, including; winning the Lancashire league in the 1926‚Äì27 season, winning the 1923 (17-0 victory over Swinton), and 1930 Lancashire Cups (18-3 victory over Wigan), and being runners-up in the 1924 (0-10 defeat by Oldham), 1926 (2-10 defeat by St. Helens), and 1933 Lancashire Cups (0-12 defeat by Oldham). Despite their success on the pitch, they played their last game on 29 April 1939. The game was away at Hull Kingston Rovers, and Recs lost 25-12. The club had been suffering for a while on falling attendances and the economic depression, it was not possible for the town to sustain two teams. Upon the termination of Recs as a professional entity, many fans and employees of Pilkington Glass declined to support the great rivals St Helens R.F.C. They instead switched allegiances to Wigan Warriors. Many families across St Helens continue to support Wigan Warriors to this day. Players earning international caps while at St. Helens Recs * F.

In 1922, he became a partner in the Chicago architectural firm of Holabird & Root. He was in charge of construction for several large projects in the Chicago area, including 333 North Michigan, the Chicago Board of Trade Building, the Palmolive Building and the Stevens Hotel. He contributed to the final designs for both Illinois' Memorial Stadium at Urbana/Champaign and Soldier Field. He remained with Holabird & Root until 1934, when he responded once more to the call of public service. Franklin D. Roosevelt administration Hackett again interrupted his business career when his government was in need of his skills ‚Äì this time those related to building and construction rather than the battlefield. Although raised a Republican, he signed on with the New Deal Public Works Administration. Hackett initially served as the Director of the PWA's Housing Division. Observers in Washington regarded his appointment as a move to speed up construction of low income housing, since the PWA had spent little of the $100 million allocated for that purpose. Later promoted to the position of Assistant Administrator, Hackett stepped down in 1937 to return to civilian pursuits. Final years in Chicago In September 1937, he became vice president of the Chicago contracting firm of Coath and Goss, Inc., as well as vice president of the Chicago Venetian Blind Company. In March 1938, he left those positions to become the president of the building firm Thompson‚ÄìStarrett Co., a pioneer in the construction of skyscrapers in the United States. He resigned from Thompson-Starrett in January 1941 to become a part owner and president of Materials Service Corporation, a large producer of sand and gravel and owner of numerous stone quarries in the Chicago area. In late August 1941, Hackett was admitted to Henrotin Hospital in Chicago suffering from pneumonia, complicated by a stroke. He died at that hospital several days later at age 61.

Stolen Cello  When Christine was small, her father bought her a rare antique concert-quality children's cello, hoping to spur her interest in the instrument, which it did. After she graduated to a full size cello, the instrument was stolen, and its whereabouts remained unknown for 40 years. When finally found, the current owner (who did not know it had been stolen) had rented it out to another very young but supremely talented cellist, whose family had spent years looking for a concert quality instrument suitable for a young cellist. After meeting the young girl, who loved the instrument as she did, Christine decided not to pursue retrieving her stolen property until after the student had graduated to a larger cello.

The series shows popular culture characters in their fictional mundane everyday life. These drawings gained substantial fame with publications the same year in major print media like Beaux Arts Magazine, Playboy and GQ among others. The series first included digital art only before Guillemin started painting the pictures on canvas using acrylic paint in March 2013. In January 2014, Guillemin started releasing sculptures, further expanding the body of his work. In February 2015, Guillemin launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in order to finance publishing of a first monograph entitled For Your Eyes Only. The project raised $62'282 in 30 days from 793 backers. The first edition of the book has been drawn to 1'500 units following the crowdfunding campaign and a second edition was subsequently drawn to 3'000 units later that year.

In: K√ºrschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender Online. Berlin: De Gruyter Professional life Rudolf Groner received a PhD in Psychology at the University of Vienna, Austria, in 1966. From 1968 ‚Äì 1970 he was postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in Theoretical Psychology at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, and member of the Michigan Mathematical Psychology Program in 1969. In 1981 he became Professor of Psychology at the University of Bern.Hochschulgeschichte Berns 1528-1984, Hallwag AG Bern, 1984. p. 728-729 He was invited Visiting Professor at Humboldt University Berlin, at the University of Wollongong, Australia, at Kyoto University and Nagoya University, Japan. From 1998 ‚Äì 2001 he was appointed Director of the Swiss National Postdoctoral Program \\"Cognitive Psychology - Basic and Applied Aspects\\". In 1971 he was the founder of VISLAB, the laboratory for the study of cognitive processes and eye movements at the University of Bern. In 1980 he founded together with Dieter Heller and Henk Breimer a transdisciplinary network \\"European Group of Scientists Active in Eye Movement Research\\" with the purpose of exchanging information about current research, equipment and software, organizing every second year in different European countries an ECEM conference (=European Conference on Eye Movements). Rudolf Groner organized the first ECEM 1981 in Bern, and 2005 the 13th ECEM again in Bern. Over all the years he served as chairperson of the group's scientific committee which consists of the organizers of all previous ECEMs. He was editor of several books based on international conferences and ECEMs, and in 2007 he founded the Journal of Eye Movement Research. After becoming emeritus at the University of Bern in 2007 Rudolf Groner is now working together with Marina Groner and former collaborators in a spin-off of his former laboratory, scians Ltd. focussing on the transfer of fundamental research to applied settings. Research From 1970 to 1990 Rudolf Groner's research interests focused on the mathematical modeling of complex cognitive activities by elementary modules.Groner, R. (1978). Hypothesen im Denkprozess. Grundlagen einer verallgemeinerten Theorie auf der Basis elementarer Informationsverarbeitung. Bern, Stuttgart & Wien: Huber. These modules consist of basic perceptual and attentional processes, and the visual information input is measured by parameters of eye fixations. The underlying processes are assumed as the generating and testing of hypotheses. In cooperation with Marina Groner he developed a hypothetico-deductive theory of cognitive activity based on a set of axioms from which probability distributions of eye movement parameters were derived and compared with empirical data of measured eye fixation distributions.Groner, R., & Groner, M. (1983). A stochastic hypothesis testing model for multi-term series problems, based on eye fixations. In: Groner, R., Menz, C., Fisher, D., & Monty, R.A. (Eds.). Eye movements and psychological functions: International views. Hillsdale N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum. In addition to eye tracking data, the same hypothetico- deductive analysis was applied to other behavioral parameters. The distribution of time spent during problem solving and the probability of erroneous solutions could be predicted by one and the same model that assumes minimal short term memory load which, however, must be compensated by extensive visual scanning of available information from the environment.Groner, R., & Groner, M.

In a series of experiments they demonstrated the relation of basic visual processes to eye movement control. More recently Groner and his colleagues explored new ways of applying eye tracking to usability research.Siegenthaler, E. & Groner, R. (2009).

The story  The story reports the apparently authentic encounter between the narrator and a poor priest. The narrator settles as a land surveyor in a poor area where the priest leads his existence. Amongst the local people, he has the reputation of a kind but miserly individual until it is found out, after his death, that his humble life only served the purpose of saving money to invest in the construction of a school that would make the long and dangerous path to school from an isolated village easier and safer for their children.  Background  In accordance with his style, Stifter constructs a complex frame story around the narrated event. There is a moral to this story, in fact in the first edition the title of the novella was \\"The poor benefactor\\" (German: \\"Der arme Wohlt√§ter\\"), but Stifter uses it primarily to give a place to numerous descriptions of nature, people and living beings, for example we can read an unmistakably Stifterian description of a storm. It can be assumed that, for Stifter, the story about the poor priest who is appreciated by the other people only after his death, serves as a vehicle to demonstrate his zeal for descriptive scenery. Not without reason does this often remind us of Thomas Bernhard's novellas, and also of Kafka's land surveyor, K., in The Castle, who could be a kinsman of the Limestone protagonist. Stifter's sense of the comic can be called into question, but it does not change anything about the grotesqueness of the character of the poor priest, which the author depicts brilliantly, alongside the hopeless venture to which he sacrificed his existence.

Compiled in an effort to present modern poetry in a way that would appeal to the young, Watermelon Pickle was long a standard in high school curricula, and has been described as a classic. The anthology consists of 114 poems, including ones by Ezra Pound, Edna St. Vincent Millay and E. E. Cummings, but also ones by lesser-known poets. It is particularly noted for \\"espous[ing] no specific morality, no politesse, and no didacticism\\", as well as for giving a relatively modern presentation with photographs and modern typefaces. This presentation was in stark contrast to the practices of textbook publishers of the 1960s, which seemingly \\"cramm[ed] as many problems onto a page as possible\\". In 1969, Watermelon Pickle was described by one commentator as having \\"become one of the more popular high school literature materials\\". Another commentator in 1999 called it \\"[t]he most widely used anthology for young adults ever and still in print\\". A 2002 article describes Watermelon Pickle as \\"establish[ing] a long-overdue niche\\" for young adult poetry.

It is a widely distributed shrub with distinctive curved leaves and white, lilac-coloured or pink flowers. Description Eremophila falcata is an erect shrub with sticky, shiny foliage growing to a height of between . Its leaves are thick, firm, glabrous, curved or sickle-shaped, usually long and wide. The flowers are borne singly or in groups of up to 4 on a stalk long. There are 5 sticky, shiny green to yellowish sepals which are mostly long and egg-shaped to spoon- shaped. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petals are white to a shade of pink or lilac with the lowest lobe of the tube brownish-yellow. The outside of the tube and petal lobes are covered with hairs and the inside surface of the lobes is glabrous apart from the central part of the lowest lobe. Long, soft hairs cover the lowest lobe and fill the inside of the petal tube. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering mainly occurs from September to November and is followed by fruits which are oval shaped to almost spherical but with a pointed end. The fruits are hairy, sticky and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1980 by Robert Chinnock and the description was published in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (falcata) is derived a Latin word meaning \\"curved like a sickle\\" referring to the leaf shape. Distribution and habitat Eremophila falcata is common and widespread in the Eremaean botanical province. It often grows in calcareous soils on stony hills and plains. Conservation status Eremophila falcata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Unusual leaf shape is a feature of this eremophila but it also produces a massed display of perfumed flowers from late spring to mid-summer. White-flowered forms appear to be covered with snow when in flower. It can be propagated from seed, from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and will grow in a wide range of soils and aspects. It will survive a drought with only occasional watering and is very tolerant to frost.

Phadke & Dr. Albert Ellis, Columbia University Libraries Archival Collection Phadke wrote his first letter to Ellis on 29 April 1968 and the correspondence lasted for 36 years. Phadke's correspondence with Ellis is considered to be one of the finest sources for REBT learners. It is of 1351 pages (bounded in four volumes). It consists of Phadke's queries/enquiries about REBT and responses given by Ellis. Phadke had been questioning, challenging and attacking almost every aspect of theory and practice of REBT. Dr. Eliis, perhaps the world's best authority on the subject, also kept sending him various books as well as articles. In 1987, Windy Dryden, a professor of Psychotherapeutic Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London expressed his wish to see this correspondence. He was very much impressed after reading these volumes and also wrote to Phadke saying that he (Phadke) really had an insatiable desire for knowledge and his attention to detail was worthy of an academic.Ellis, A. (1994). Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy: Revised and Updated. Carol Publishing, pg 461. After Ellis‚Äô death, these volumes are preserved and cited in Archives of Columbia University.Albert Ellis Papers, Series I: Correspondence, 1947-2006, Correspondence of K.M. Phadke & Dr. Albert Ellis, Columbia University Libraries Archival Collection  REBT: The life goal  Phadke had left ATIRA in 1969 and joined Mumbai University as a demonstrator in the Department of Psychology. He left the university in 4 years and joined as faculty at Sir Sorabji Pochkanawala Bankers Training College, Mumbai in 1973. He was aiming to spread REBT throughout India. With this vision, he resigned his teaching post at Banking college in 1981 and established his own training centre. It was named 'Phadke Centre' with the objective of imparting education for life through REBT.  Phadke Centre  Phadke Centre,Albert Ellis Papers, Series I: Correspondence, 1947-2006, Correspondence of K.M. Phadke & Dr. Albert Ellis, Columbia University Libraries Archival Collection the first learning center of REBT in India, offered a variety of individual and group programmes founded on the principles and techniques of REBT. He created his own training modules of primary and advanced workshops for professionals as well as two day workshops for non-professionals. Thousands of trainees, more than 200 organizations organized his training programmes for their employees, about 10000 executives from all levels of management. In the contemporary transactional analysis' era, training in REBT was just inconceivable to industry. Being a pioneer, Phadke encountered considerable opposition from the start but using REBT's philosophy, he could develop an elegant model of training programmes for industries. He has delivered professional talks in various business, industrial, educational, research and training organizations.  Challenges and struggles  After getting first introduction to REBT at Gujarat University, Phadke started reading books on wide range of subjects such as psychology, philosophy, literature, language, political science, economics, sociology. These books assisted him to study, investigate and deeply engage with issues and concerns related to human behavior. During this time, he started correspondence with Dr. Ellis regarding his questions and queries. Ellis also started to send him his books and articles along with the answers. Phadke faced many problems in receiving the posts. Despite of that, today he has a collection of Ellis' 76 books and more than 600 articles and research papers. Needless to mention, he has deeply studied and analyzed this material. His source of learning REBT was from Ellis'books, some of which contained verbatim records of Ellis'cases. He studied numerous cases of Ellis, drew his own conclusions and compared them to those of Ellis.  Fellow and supervisor  In 1977, Institute for Advanced Study in Rational Psychotherapy, (currently known as Albert Ellis Institute , New York) honored him the status of 'Fellow' and later, in 1989, he was awarded the honour of 'Supervisor'. Ellis, A. (2007). Overcoming resistance: A rational emotive behavior therapy integrated approach Springer Publishing Company According to the regulations of the institute of that time, the status of fellow was given to only those aspirants who had a post-doctorate in psychology and had completed 2 years intensive training programme of the institute.Short Term Therapy, Long Term Results, Catalog 2007-08, Albert Ellis Institute, pg 6. Although Phadke had neither a doctorate nor had he visited the institute, the concerned committee got convinced with significance of his work in India and made Phadke an exception to the criteria. The status of supervisor enabled him to conduct training programmes for professionals.  Contributions to REBT  Absence of efficient communication system between Phadke and his mentor, Dr. Ellis, forced him to rely on his own resources and made him to innovate his own techniques of practicing REBT. This elegant method of learning resulted in new research findings in the theory and practice of REBT. Ellis praised his dedication and mastery over this subject with saying 'I still feel you are the only person in Asia that I consider to be extremely well qualified to practice and preach REBT.'.Albert Ellis Papers, Series I: Correspondence, 1947-2006, Correspondence of K.M. Phadke & Dr. Albert Ellis, Columbia University Libraries Archival Collection He has made original contributions to the theory and practice of REBT, which were greatly acknowledged by Ellis. Some of the contributions to the theory of REBT are as follows: = Denotation of 'D' letter = In the classical form, the letter 'D' in the A-B-C-D-E theory stands for the therapeutic technique of Disputing the client's irrational beliefs. Phadke expanded the letter 'D' and created modified three-fold denotation- a) Detection b) Disputation c) Discrimination. Ellis has incorporated this denotation in ABC structure of REBT.Ellis, A. (1977). Anger: How to live with and without. Readers Digest Press, pg 56. = Enlargement of 'B' letter = Phadke demonstrated to Ellis that it is incorrect to classify desires, preferences, demands and commands as Beliefs- rational or irrational. In order to incorporate the human motives in the A-B-C theory, he coined the more comprehensive term for B- Bedrock of Biosocial Forces. In the later years, he reinterpreted letter 'B' more accurately as bipartite belief system. It includes the detection of binary message which the client signals to himself as well as the bipartite belief system, implied in that message.Digiuseppe,Raymond(2007). Overcoming resistance: A rational emotive behavior therapy integrated approach. Springer Publishing Company. = Redefinition of 'C' = Phadke gave a special thought to 'C' which was earlier described merely as Consequences. He precisely named it as 'Choice-blocking consequences'.Arthur Freeman, 2004, Cognition and Psychotherapy: second edition, Springer Publishing Company In later years, he further elaborated it by making a distinction between choice freeing consequences leading to healthy emotions and choice blocking consequences leading to unhealthy emotions. = Extension of 'E' = One of the REBT proponent, GarciaGarcia, E.J. (1977). Working on the E in RET. in J.L. Wolfe and E. Brand (Eds). Twenty Years of Rational Therapy, New York: Institute for Rational Living. suggested the letter 'E' could stand for a) Empathy b) Emotion and c) Experience. Phadke added yet another meaning to the letter E, namely Enthusiasm.Ellis Albert,1996, Better, Deeper And More Enduring Brief Therapy: The Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach, Routledge = Modification of the Approval Principles = After closely observing the behavior of hundreds of people, Phadke arrived at the conclusion that the principle of Approval in REBT has to be supplemented by the Principle of Disapproval which he stated as follows: 'No one should dislike or disapprove of me for whatever I do.' Ellis graciously accepted his suggestion and it was incorporated in his subsequent presentation of masturbatory ideologies.Ellis, A. (1979). The intelligent woman's guide to dating and mating. Secaucus, N.J: Lyle Stuart. pg 200. Phadke went further and suggested a two-fold classification of masturbatory ideologies instead of three. 1. What I should get, feel and do. 2. What I should not have to get, feel and do. This classification made the work of detecting the irrational beliefs easyEllis Albert,1996, Better, Deeper And More Enduring Brief Therapy: The Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach, Routledge = Review of Rationality = Phadke pointed out that five criteria of rational behavior proposed in REBT were not sufficiently comprehensive. They seemed to omit a vital aspect of man's behavior towards others. In order to cover that aspect, he suggested an additional criterion- Rational behavior does no needless, definite and deliberate harm to others Ellis, A. (1977). How to live with and without ange r. Readers Digest Press, pg 56 = Emotive- Rational Therapy = Phadke proposed that the distinction between Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) and Emotive Rational Therapy (ERT) can generate at least verifiable hypotheses. He further elaborated that the clients' irrational beliefs about himself may be disputed by using ERT whereas the clients' irrational beliefs about others and the world may be disputed effectively by using RET. RET is more effective in disputing the client's inferences whereas ERT is more effective in disputing the client's evaluationsEllis Albert,1996, Better, Deeper And More Enduring Brief Therapy: The Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach, Routledge = New format of teaching REBT = Phadke devised 8A format Digiuseppe,Raymond (2007). Overcoming resistance: A rational emotive behavior therapy integrated approach Springer Publishing Company of presenting the basic principles of REBT. A1 to A4 are used for detection of psychopathology and A5 to A8 are used for the treatment. Brief outline of this format is as follows: A1- Assumption A2-Appraisal A3-Agony A4-Astray A5-Articulate A6-Attack A7-Attune A8-Adjust = Theory of surplus values = This term was devised by Phadke to his intervention strategies to suit the client's background. Usage of this term makes easy for the practitioner to make the clients understand the surplus value they are attaching to some events in their lifeHarper R. (1997). A guide to Rational Living. Melvin Powers Wilshire Book Company, pg 270 = Others = Phadke invented many innovative practices of REBT which are as follows: # Effective way of teaching the meaning of awful, horrible or terrible # The Devil's Advocate- An exercise in Rational Thinking # The involvement Debate # Refinement of Rational- Emotive-Imagery # Empathic Role Play # Role Reversal # A Second-Order Cognitive Therapeutic Technique # Emotive technique of controlling one's emotions and behaviour Some of these techniquesDryden, W. (1997). The Practice of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. Springer Publishing Company, Second edition, pg 260 were used effectively for the advancement of the practice of REBT. This was clearly displayed when psychologists from CaliforniaGordon, R; & Gordon, M. (2006). The Turned- off- Child. Millennial Mind Publishing, First edition, pgs 123. acknowledged that the technique of role reversal devised by Phadke was an effective assessment technique to increase awareness of faulty perceptions of reality.  Later life  At the age of 71, Phadke decided to retire from all of his professional activities, including the closing of Phadke Centre. Dr. Ellis, in his autobiography ‚Äì All Out!, has written about the unusual influence of Phadke on him. Ellis says: 'One of the most unusual influences on me and my work has been that of the psychologist Kishor M. Phadke, of Mumbai, India. I would never have figured out some of the finer points of REBT without his detailed questioning, and I want to thank him for that....He has certainly been one of my finest friends and supporters since 1968.'Debbie Joffe Ellis (2010 ) All Out.

Taxonomy In 1967, Pekka T. Lehtinen transferred the species Amaurobius laminatus, first described by Tamerlan Thorell in 1878, into his newly created genus Pandava as P. laminata, placing it in the family Titanoecidae. Over 30 years later, in 2001, a further species, Pandava hunanensis, was added to the genus. A major revision of Pandava in 2010 saw five new species being added. Diagnosis Male spiders placed in the genus Pandava differ from other species of Titanoecidae in features of the palpal bulb: the tegular process (a projection from the tegulum) is smaller; the median apophysis (one of the hardened plates making up the palpal bulb) is thumb-shaped. Females differ in features of the epigynum: the copulatory openings are more anterior.

In the 13th century it was enlarged as an enclosure castle into accommodate the population in case of danger. The castle took part in the founding of the city of L'Aquila and it was attacked and destroyed by the condottiero Braccio da Montone on 23 April 1424 during the siege of that city. It was still included as part of L'Aquila until 1529, when it became a fief of aristocratic families. Around the 16th century, it lost its defensive role and was abandoned. In memory of the epidemic occurred in 1526, the church of Saint Roch was built close to one of the castle's towers and it houses a wooden statue of the saint and some frescoes.

Excavated primarily by Julio Mercader in 2007, Ngalue is a Middle Stone Age site. Due to its relatively dry environment and the shape of the cave, Ngalue had very good preservation and not only were stone tools and animal bones found. There were preserved starch grains on many of the stone tools as well. Overall, this site can help add to our knowledge of the Middle Stone Age site in the Niassa valley and to our understanding of the subsistence of Middle Stone Age peoples in Eastern Africa as a whole.  The site  The cave is made of dolomite marble and the mouth stretches inward before expanding into a wider cave. The cave is labeled with a few main parts, lower bed 1, lower bed 2, the middle bed, and the hearth beds. The latter three sections contained the largest number of artifacts and the middle beds in particular provided much of the information gained during and after excavation. Using radiocarbon dating, uranium series dating, and electron spin resonance dating, the time period of human occupation in the cave has been accurately dated to between 105 and 40 thousand years ago.  Tools  There were 727 total stone artifacts found at the Ngalue Cave site. 555 of these artifacts were found in the middle beds of the cave. Most of these tools were made of quartz material brought in from the surrounding area. The tools display discoidal reduction and are usually handheld tools, although some of the smaller tools were braced. Cores were common, flakes were not as present, and there were formal tools at the site. Along with stone axes, there were also scrapers and awls. There were a few special objects as well. These include a rhyolite grinder, a rhyolite ground cobble, and a faceted quartz core tool. All three of these objects had an ochre pigment on them, giving a red/ orange appearance and one had a patina over it. The tools from the Niassa region, including those of Ngalue, are different from anywhere else. Late Middle Stone Age tool technology like Still Bay, Howiesons Poort, and blade technology are not seen in the Niassa region, at least not at any known sites.  Starch  Starch analysis of stone tools in forested and relatively damp areas in Africa has been difficult due to a lack of preservation. However, there are a few ways that microbotanicals can preserve in environments like this. Quartz is a material that encapsulates materials and the silt around it allows rapid molecular bonding. Because of this preservation by the quartz, the stone tools in Ngalue cave were able to be analyzed for evidence of the use of starch in the diets of the Middle Stone Age population in the area. Julio Mercader chose approximately 12% of the stone tools found in the cave to be analyzed. The results were promising. The tools had two hundred and seventy times the number of starch granules than the sediments around it. The tools also contained one hundred twenty-five times the number of granules as the topsoil sampled outside the cave had. Out of all of the grains recovered 89% were sorghum. 3.5% were from woody plants specifically matching samples of certain seeds legumes and nuts. 3% of the total assemblage were pear shaped starches whose closest match is the trunk of the African wine palm. Another starch was from the African false banana and the evidence for this starch was restricted to a grinder, a core axe, and a Levallois flake. The last starch found was 12 clusters of fused granules whose closest match is the African potato. The analysis of this data shows that the environment in the Middle Stone Age was densely wooded with a tall grass understory.  Importance  Ngalue Cave excavations have and will lend themselves toward a number of exciting research paths to enlighten our understanding of the human record. The stone tools from Ngalue were dated with absolute means, and this was the first time Middle Stone Age lithics had been dated in northern Mozambique. This site can also help archaeologists to understand past ecosystems and the movement of humans through Africa in the Middle Stone Age.  Other sites  There is an abundance of evidence for sites in northern Mozambique, especially Middle Stone Age sites. For example, Nuno Bicho and team found evidence for over 90 paleolithic sites in the area in only 20 days of fieldwork. Despite this, extensive research has not been done in the area. Two sites other than Ngalue, Mvumu and Mikuyu, have been excavated. At both sites the lithic technology was very similar with quartz being the main raw material. It seems that this trend, visible at Ngalue as well, continued from 105 to 29 thousand years ago. The lack of comparable data makes it difficult to draw conclusions about subsistence, chronology, or technology from the MSA evidence in the area. How and why the Niassa region is different from sites with similar dates around the continent is an interesting topic for future research.
