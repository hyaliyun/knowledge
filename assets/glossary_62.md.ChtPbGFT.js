It was destroyed by Admiral Hammerton Killick in 1902 to prevent it falling into the hands of a German warship. Description The ship displaced 950 tons. It was powered by a triple expansion steam engine driving a single screw propeller, giving a speed of . Armament comprised a 16 cm, 12 cm and four 10 cm guns, four Nordenfelt machine guns and two Maxim machine guns. Commission The Haitian Government commissioned an armed cruiser to be designed by Sir E J Reed and built by Earle's Shipbuilding & Engineering Co at Hull, Yorkshire, England. The ship was launched as Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot, named for the revolutionary battle of Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot, on 7 November 1895. After arming in France, it was added to the Haitian Navy in 1896 and considered the Navy's crown jewel, the best of the four ships it possessed at the time. Cr√™te-√†-Pierrots first commander was Captain Gilmour, from Scotland, who served under contract to Haiti. Destruction In 1943 the ship appeared on a postage stamp commemorating its 1902 destruction In 1902 Haiti was enveloped in a civil war over who would become president after the sudden resignation of Tir√©sias Simon Sam. Cr√™te-√†- Pierrot was controlled by Admiral Hammerton Killick and supporters of Ant√©nor Firmin and was used to blockade ports where Pierre Nord Alexis was gathering troops. There was a plan to use Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot to transport Firmin to Port- au-Prince while Jean Jumeau marched on Port-au-Prince by land. In September 1902, Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot seized a German ammunition ship, Markomannia en route to provide ammunition to Alexis' forces. Alexis asked Germany for help subduing a pirate ship. In response, Germany sent the gunboat to find and capture Cr√™te- √†-Pierrot. On 6 September, Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot was in port at Gona√Øves, with Killick and most of the crew on Shore leave when Panther appeared. Killick rushed aboard and ordered his crew to abandon ship. When all but four crew members had evacuated the ship Killick, inspired by the tale of Captain LaPorte, wrapped himself in a Haitian flag, fired the aft magazine, and blew up the ship rather than let the Germans take her. Killick and the remaining four crew members went down with the ship. An hour later, Panther fired thirty shots at Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot to finish it off, then sailed away. The ship's rifles and machine guns were salvaged, along with the bodies of the crew that remained on board. Gallery File:SMS Panther (1901).jpg, the German ship sent to capture Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot.

Vignola and adapted by Luther Reed from the play by Guy Bolton and George Middleton. The film stars Marion Davies, T. Roy Barnes, Tom Lewis, William Norris, Percy Ames, Leon Gordon, and Luella Gear. Marion Davies plays an extravagant girl who, when her father goes bust, reforms by learning the simple life and making a farm a thriving business venture.Lorusso, Edward (2017) The Silent Films of Marion Davies, CreateSpace, pp. 83-84. The film was released on February 11, 1923, by Paramount Pictures. Plot As described in a film magazine, Eva (Davies), daughter of millionaire James King (Lewis), spends money wastefully and enjoys life wonderfully. Her elder sister Julie (Gear) and her husband Clinton Dewitt (Gordon) live in the King mansion, content to share the wealthy man's fortunes. Among Eva's admirers are Dr. Delamater (Davidson) and Lord Andrew Gordon (Ames), each financially weak and desiring a rich wife. Old James is nearly driven mad by his daughter's extravagances. His South American representative Adam Smith (Barnes) comes to New York City to see him. James suddenly announces that he will go to South America for a few months and leave Adam in charge of his family and the Gotham City business interests. While James is gone, Adam falls in love with Eva but is unable to curb her spendthrift ways until he comes up with the idea of declaring that her father is ruined, which brings matters to a climax. Confronted by poverty, Eva rises to the occasion and makes her sister go to work as well as her Uncle Horace (Norris), and goes to live on a farm belonging to her father. There, with her sister and aided by Adam, she proceeds to raise eggs and honey for the markets. The family works hard. One day James returns to be stunned with the news that his previously ne'er-do- wells have turned over a new leaf and are making good. When the family learns the truth about James, they do not regret the lesson they have learned. Cast *Marion Davies as Eva King *T.

Their line up consisted of guitarist Kevin Whitley, bassist Owen McMahon, and drummer Brent Prager. During their initial run, they released two albums and an outtake compilation, all of which were released through Trance Syndicate. They broke up in 1994, shortly before the release of their second album Heroin Man. They reunited in 2014 and a third full-length, titled 2 YNFYNYTY, was released on March 3, 2015 through Brutal Panda Records. A second reunion album, titled Immanculada High, was issued through Relapse Records on July 26, 2019. History Cherubs were formed in 1991 by Kevin Whitley (former Ed Hall drummer), Owen McMahon, and Brent Prager. In early 1992, they were signed through Trance Syndicate, an independent record label owned by King Coffey of The Butthole Surfers, before they even performed their first live show. That same year they released their debut album Icing. The album's lead single, \\"Pink Party Dessert\\", was released as a single on 7\\" vinyl, which was even played through BBC Radio 1 by disc jockey John Peel. Their follow-up record, Heroin Man, was released two years later. The album's title and lyrical themes were influenced by the heroin-induced overdose of Dave DeLuna, a very close friend of the band. The band broke up before the album's release, following a fight between Prager and McMahon after a live show. In 1996, Trance Syndicate released Short of Popular, a compilation album that was made up of b-sides, rarities, and outtakes recorded throughout the band's brief run. In 2013, a compilation titled Everyone's Dead Before They Leave: A Tribute to the Cherubs was released through Unfortunate Miracle Records, which compiles various covers of songs by the Cherubs done by many different bands. The title is a reference to a lyric from \\"Pink Party Dessert\\". In 2014, the Cherubs reunited and began recording a new album over the summer. On December 15, it was announced via a YouTube video that the new album will be titled 2 YNFYNYTY. The album was released by Brutal Panda Records on March 3, 2015 through digital download, cassette, and vinyl formats. In October 2014, they released a new song, titled \\"Fist In The Air\\", on the Brutal Panda Records soundcloud page. The track was recorded during the 2 YNFYNYTY sessions, and digital pre- orders were given to those who purchased a T-shirt from the Brutal Panda Records website. When asked about their plans on recording new material, Whitley mentioned that the \\"next record will be about moving on\\". In early 2016, the band announced that they will release the Fist In The Air extended play on double 7\\" vinyl format. The EP was released on February 26 of that year. On August 22, the band performed at Beerland, the first show by the band in over 20 years. They later performed at the Mohawk's 10th anniversary celebration on September 17.

Goblinshead. p54 History In 1399 the property was acquired by the Blairs of Balthavock; this was by a grant by David II.Maurice Lindsay (1986) The Castles of Scotland. Constable. p54 Patrick Blair of Ardblair was beheaded for the murder of George Drummond of Ledcrieff and his son, cousins of the Earl of Atholl, after a trial in 1554. Through marriage the property passed to the Oliphants of Gask in 1792, and the house remains the property of the Blair Oliphant family. Many Jacobite relics were brought to the property from Gask during the 20th century. Lady Nairne, the songwriter, was a frequent visitor to the castle. Structure Ardblair Castle It is thought that the original castle was built by the Blairs during the Norman period, on the site of a fort, with the tower at the north west being built on the foundation of part of the earlier castle. Ardblair Castle is one of the few castles which still has its courtyard. The original L-plan tower house had three storeys and an attic. There is a stair-turret, which is corbelled out to above the first storey, in the re-entrant angle. It is capped by a conical roof. The later additions form a courtyard, the north side being a wall with a central arched gateway, dated from 1668. In the centre of the courtyard there is a sundial bearing the date 1623 and with 25 dials. The entrance has an ornate panel space above it, though this has no inscription. The basement, which probably housed the kitchen, is vaulted. It has a wide fireplace; its massive chimney-stack it a notable feature of the main building's south side. The tower had a Hall on the first floor, which is now the panelled dining-room, dating from the 18th century. The interior mainly dates from the 18th century. The castle was once almost surrounded by a loch, which is now largely drained. It is a category A listed building. Tradition The castle is said to be haunted by a 'green lady', who is dressed in green silk, and who searches the chambers of the castle. It is supposed that this is Lady Jean Drummond of Newton, who died of a broken heart having fallen in love with one of the Blairs, despite the feuds between the families. She drowned in a local marsh.

It seeks to ensure the U.S. Department of State upholds its promises of Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) to combat zone translators who worked with U.S. and NATO troops during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as provides financial and housing assistance to individuals and families who have emigrated to the United States under the SIV program. History In 2008, Matthew Zeller was deployed in Afghanistan where he worked with Janis Shinwari, an Afghan translator. According to Zeller, during a lengthy ambush in April, when Zeller had run low on ammunition, Shinwari stepped in and killed two Taliban fighters, saving Zeller's life and immediately putting Shinwari as a high-priority target on the Taliban's kill list. After Zeller's battalion had departed Afghanistan, Shinwari was left to fend for himself while he waited for his SIV paperwork to be processed. After extensive advocacy from Zeller, including direct appeals to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and a viral campaign that raised $30,000, Shinwari and his family were finally approved to emigrate to the U.S. in October 2013. When Zeller had offered Shinwari the money to help him and family resettle, he declined and asked that he use it to help other Afghan and Iraqi translators settle down in their safe havens. Translators helped to immigrate to the United States by No One Left Behind include Munther Alaskry and his wife and children.

The Lloyd Alexander was identical to the Lloyd 600 in most respects, but in place of the three speed transmission of the Lloyd 600, the Lloyd Alexander featured a four-speed gear-box (and a higher final drive ratio). The Lloyd Alexander was offered, in parallel with the Lloyd 600, between 1957 and 1961. One difference visible from the outside was that the Lloyd Alexander included an opening hatch into the rear luggage locker, whereas drivers of the Lloyd 600 had to reach behind the rear seat in order to access the luggage locker. There was also a Lloyd Alexander TS offered between 1958 and 1961 which featured a larger carburetor and a high final drive ratio, as a result of which it offered a maximum power output of 25 PS instead of the 19 PS available from the engine fitted to the Lloyd 600 and standard Lloyd Alexander. Engine and running gear =Lloyd 600 and Lloyd Alexander= The Lloyd 600 and Lloyd Alexander were powered by an air-cooled two cylinder engine with a chain driven overhead camshaft. Unlike the Lloyd 400 which the Lloyd 600 initially complemented and then - after 1957 - replaced, the newer car featured a four- stroke engine. The cylinders were configured in parallel. The engine capacity of 596cc provided for a maximum power output of 19 PS (14 kW) at 4,500 rpm in the version supplied on the Lloyd 600 and the standard Lloyd Alexander, applying a 6.6:1 compression ratio. The top speed listed was 100 km/h (63 mph) and the car could reach 100 km/h from a standing start in 60 seconds. The car was fueled using \\"regular\\" grade petrol/gasoline and when driven normally consumed fuel significantly more frugally than West Germany's best selling small car, the Volkswagen. Space was at a premium in the Lloyd 600 and the 25 litre fuel tank was accommodated ahead of the bulkhead underneath the front hood/bonnet in a space shared with the engine and the six-volt battery. Power was fed to the front wheels via a three speed manual gear box which used the same ratios as it had on the earlier Lloyd 400 from which it was lifted. The front wheels were suspended from two transversely mounted overlapping leaf- springs, supported by telescopic shock absorbers: the rear wheels were attached to a Swing axle supported with longitudinally mounted leaf springs. The footbrake was controlled using a hydraulic linkage and drum brakes all round. The hand-brake worked on the front wheels and was operated with a cable linkage. The steering employed a rack and pinion mechanism which was conventional at the time. It required 2¬º turns between opposite locks: the turning circle was . =Lloyd Alexander TS= The Lloyd Alexander TS which appeared in 1958 was easy to differentiate from the basic Lloyd Alexander due to its \\"semi-elliptical\\" (more curved edges) front grille. The TS was fitted with an all-synchromesh four-speed gear box. Thanks to the larger carburetor and raised compression ratio ‚Äì in this application of 7.2:1 ‚Äì the manufacturer was able to claim a top speed for the Lloyd Alexander TS of 107 km/h (68 mph) and the time to 100 km/h from a standing start was reduced to 56 seconds. The Lloyd Alexander TS also came with a completely redesigned back axle, which significantly improved the car's handling, and anticipated the rear-suspension configuration on the Lloyd Arabella (which appeared in Lloyd showrooms the next year). The rear axle was attached using semi-trailing arms (generally identified in contemporary sources simply as \\"trailing arms\\") with \\"progressively acting\\" coil springs. The TS also incorporated detailed enhancements such as the windscreen washer system and, new for 1957, asymmetrically dipping headlight beams. Body As with its predecessor, the Lloyd 400, the full name of the Lloyd 600 featured a two letter prefix that identified the body shape as follows: LP600 (\\"Limousine\\" / saloon), LC600 (\\"Cabrio-Limousine\\" / cabriolet), LK600 (panel van) and LS600 (estate). With the Lloyd Alexander these prefixes were dropped. There was, in any case, no \\"Cabrio-Limousine\\" version of the Lloyd Alexander listed. Ten years earlier, with steel in desperately short supply, Lloyds in this class had been constructed round a timber frame, and covered with synthetic leather, or more recently using a combination of steel panels for the \\"outer door skins\\" and fabric covering for parts of the car body not needing the same level of exterior rigidity. This history was reflected in the structural architecture of the newer steel-bodied Lloyd 600 and Lloyd Alexander models. The Lloyd 400 had, since October 1954, used an all-steel body, with panels that were bolted on to the steel frame and were therefore far easier to replace, if necessary, than bent body panels on competitor models from Volkswagen or NSU, constructed with welded steel body shells. This feature was carried over to the Lloyd 600 and Lloyd Alexander. The body sat of a tubular steel chassis. The windscreen on the Lloyd 600 and Lloyd Alexander models was flat. At the back, however, on all Lloyd saloons/sedans a small flat rear window had been replaced by a full- width curved rear window back in 1954. The doors were hinged at their rear edge through till 1961, by which the arrangement was becoming rare. It facilitated access, at least to the front seats, but by the 1960s people were beginning to express safety concerns over the risk of the doors bursting open while the car was moving. The Lloyd Alexander saloon / sedan was differentiated from the Lloyd 600 by an external \\"boot/trunk lid\\" giving access to the luggage compartment for those unable or unwilling to clamber into the passenger cabin and reach past the back of the back seat. Another visible difference was the windows on the doors, which on the Lloyd Alexander wound down fully into the doors. On the Lloyd 600 only the front half of the two part door window could be opened, sliding horizontally backwards, a lightweight inexpensive arrangement which was replicated in Britain on the first Minis in 1959. The Lloyd 600 / Lloyd Alexander body offered accommodation in the passenger cabin for four adults, but access to the rear seat was difficult and space cramped, with the width of the back seat reduced by the space taken up by the rear wheel arches. There was more space at the front, although there were criticisms that the steering wheel was too close to the driver. The luggage locker at the back had a total computed capacity of 104 litres. Lloyd itself still had no heavy presses for stamping body panels from sheet steel. Body panels for the Lloyd 600 and Lloyd Alexander were produced by Allgaier and Karmann and then delivered in bare-metal form to the Lloyd factory in Bremen for machining, assembly and painting. Commercial During the 1950s the small car market in West Germany was increasingly dominated by Volkswagen. In 1955, Volkswagen produced 279,986 passenger cars. Apart from a handful of exotic looking (and exotically priced) vehicles, the passenger cars produced by Volkswagen were all the same shape. The shape had been innovative twenty years earlier, but the architecture and look of the car had changed very little since. The approach of the Borgward Group could hardly have been more different. In 1955 the group produced 91,810 passenger cars, using three different brands and offering a wider range of models than any other West German manufacturer, with models replaced or substantially upgraded every few years. One result of these contrasting approaches was that it was Volkswagen that set the prices in what was still an acutely price sensitive market segment. In March 1954 the price of a standard Volkswagen was reduced to DM 3,950. It came down again, to DM 3,790, in August 1955, a level that it held till 1961. The standard Lloyd 600 was priced, between 1955 and 1958 at DM 3,680, a price which after 1955 undercut the larger and faster (albeit less fuel efficient and, some felt, more \\"old-fashioned\\") Volkswagen by a margin of barely more than DM 100. With the Lloyd Alexander, launched in 1957, there was no attempt to undercut the basic Volkswagen on price. The standard Lloyd Alexander was launched in 1957 with an advertised price of DM 4,060. The Lloyd Alexander TS arrived in 1958 priced at DM 4,330. Sales analysis differentiating between the Lloyd 600 and the Lloyd Alexander has not been located, but combining the two models gives a sales volume between 1955 and 1961 of 176,524 units. Sales dropped off sharply in 1960 which was the first full year of production for the manufacturer's own new Arabella model. The first NSU Prinz, very similar in terms of size and performance, and priced in 1958 at DM 3,739, managed a production volume of 94,549 units between 1958 and 1962. By 1960 Volkswagen were producing more than 700,000 Beetles in a single year. Their West German competitors were feeling the squeeze. Australian assembly The Lloyd 600 was assembled in Australia by a company formed as joint venture between Carl Borgward and Laurence Hartnett in the late 1950s. The car was introduced in December 1957 as the Lloyd-Hartnett and a total of 3000 cars were built before production ceased in 1962.

According to the founder Arunabh Kumar, the thought behind starting TVF was to reach out to the younger generation who seldom watch television entertainment. The Viral Fever was one of the early arrivals on the Indian digital entertainment segment with videos covering a range of topics on Indian politics, movies, lifestyle, and emerging social concepts. The Viral Fever was the pioneer of web-series in India with cult hits like Permanent Roommates and Pitchers. As of June 2020, TVF has over 71 lakh (7.17 million) subscribers on YouTube. The company runs the app and website, TVFPlay to host their videos. TVF conceptualised the idea of promoting movies through the creation and distribution of original digital content. The Ishq Wala song series is one such venture. The first web series Permanent Roommates debuted in 2014. It was the second most-viewed long-form web series in the world by June 2015. A second original series titled TVF Pitchers was released in June 2015. It portrays engineers at different companies who quit their jobs to create a startup company. Owing to its growing popularity, with both TVF Pitchers and Permanent Roommates being watched by millions around the globe, the company received a funding of $10 million from Tiger Global as was reported on 17 February 2016. Background =Early days= After graduating from IIT Kharagpur, Kumar quit his job as a consultant for US Air Force to try his hand at production jobs, assisting Farah Khan on Om Shanti Om. After a few production jobs, Kumar began to write and produce his own short films and videos. Arunabh Kumar, along with long-time friends and IIT alumni, Amit Golani, and Biswapati Sarkar began pitching shows aimed at the youth to MTV. Faced with rejection, The Viral Fever was founded when the group came together and released a video titled Rowdies on YouTube starring Deepak Kumar Mishra and Naveen Kasturia. The runaway success of the video prompted Arunabh to create the YouTube focused video company, The Viral Fever, in 2012. =Growth on Youtube (2012‚Äì2014) = The Viral Fever released the first Barely Speaking with Arnub video with an interview of Shah Rukh Khan, and an appearance by then and current Delhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal. Biswapati Sarkar's parody of Indian news anchor Arnab Goswami was widely appreciated. TVF's content was dominated by parodies during these years with videos like Gaana Waala Song, Gangs of Social Media and Munna Jazbaati contributing to the growing popularity of The Viral Fever. The channel was recognised as one of the first success stories of original digital content in India. =Pioneering web-series in India (2015‚Äìpresent)= After a few years of creating \\"viral videos\\", The Viral Fever released India's first web-series, Permanent Roommates, in 2015. Featuring then-unknown actor Sumeet Vyas and Nidhi Singh, Permanent Roommates has been watched over 5 crore (50 million) times. Pitchers was lauded as one of the best shows in recent memory in Indian entertainment for capturing the zeitgeist of the Indian startup scene. In 2016, The Viral Fever released the smash hit Tripling, and the widely applauded Humorously Yours. Other TVF network channels like Girliyapa, The Screen Patti and The Timeliners have also successfully debuted web-series. =TVFPlay & funding from Tiger Global (early 2016‚Äìpresent)= TVF debuted their platform, releasing the final two episodes of Pitchers on TVFPlay. The platform saw 10 lakh (1 million) hits in the first two days and crashed for 3 hours. In early 2016, venture capital firm Tiger Global Management invested $10 million into The Viral Fever, acquiring a 20% stake in the company. The Viral Fever has since launched other YouTube channels for original content: Girliyapa, a female-run channel, The Screen Patti, and The Timeliners, headquartered in New Delhi. TVF currently has offices in Mumbai, New Delhi, and Palo Alto. =Branded entertainment= The Viral Fever is one of the most sought after creators of original content with brands in India. TVF claims to have worked with over 150 brands.

He is the son of wrestler Jim \\"The Sandman\\" Fullington and valet Lori \\"Peaches\\" Fullington. He is best known for his childhood appearances with the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1996 and 1997 as part of the feud between The Sandman and Raven, described by WWE as \\"one of the most emotional rivalries in sports-entertainment's history\\".  Professional wrestling career  = Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996-1997) = Fullington entered the world of professional wrestling in June 1996 at the age of six. He was brought into Extreme Championship Wrestling by booker Paul Heyman, who wanted to experiment with more soap operaesque storylines. Tyler's father, The Sandman, had begun feuding with Raven over the ECW World Heavyweight Championship earlier that year. In the course of the feud, Raven attempted to play mind games with The Sandman by brainwashing his ex-wife, Lori, to become part of his entourage Raven's Nest. At Hardcore Heaven on June 22, 1996, Raven revealed that Tyler had also joined his side. Dressed in Raven's signature outfit of leather jacket, t-shirt and jean shorts, Tyler accused The Sandman of being \\"a drunk\\" and stated that he \\"worshipped\\" Raven, leaving The Sandman tearful. Tyler subsequently began accompanying Raven to ringside for his matches, with Raven using him to wage psychological warfare against The Sandman. A series of vignettes aired on ECW Hardcore TV, including one in which Tyler blamed The Sandman for his parents' divorce and one in which Raven and his lackeys held a birthday party for Tyler. At Heat Wave on July 13, 1996, The Sandman teamed with Terry Gordy and Tommy Dreamer to face Raven and his allies Brian Lee and Stevie Richards in a cage match. After Dreamer handcuffed Raven to the cage, Tyler entered the ring and stood between Raven and The Sandman, preventing The Sandman from hitting Raven and allowing Raven's lackey, Super Nova, to free him. Despite Tyler's involvement, The Sandman was ultimately able to pin Raven and win the match. At The Doctor Is In on August 3, 1996, Tyler again placed himself in front of Raven during his ECW World Heavyweight Championship title match with The Sandman, helping Raven pin The Sandman and retain the title. At Natural Born Killaz on August 24, 1996, The Sandman and Pitbull #2 defeated Raven and Shane Douglas in a dog collar match. Following the match, Tyler demanded that The Sandman give him his Singapore cane. After The Sandman acquiesced, Tyler and Raven each caned The Sandman. At High Incident on October 26, 1996, Tyler was involved in one of ECW's most controversial angles, with Raven's Nest \\"crucifying\\" The Sandman by tying him to a cross and placing a crown made of barbed wire on his head. The angle, which was widely criticised as being in poor taste, led to Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle severing his links with ECW and delayed the promotion's debut on pay-per-view. On October 5, 1996 at Ultimate Jeopardy, The Sandman and Dreamer faced Lee and Richards in a tag team bout with Raven's ECW World Heavyweight Championship on the line (Raven was unable to compete). The Sandman pinned Richards to win the title. At November to Remember on November 16, 1995, Raven faced The Sandman in a rematch but was unable to defeat him, despite assistance from Lori and Tyler. At Holiday Hell on December 7, 1996, Raven regained the title from The Sandman in a barbed wire match. In late December 1996, Raven's longtime lackey Stevie Richards turned on him. On February 1, 1997 at \\"Crossing the Line Again\\", Tyler and Lori left Raven and joined Richards' Blue World Order. At CyberSlam on February 22, 1997, Richards, Tyler and Lori came to the ring to berate Raven and Lee, who had given a concussion to Terry Funk. After Lee chokeslammed Richards and Raven DDT'ed Lori, Tyler ran backstage and reemerged with The Sandman, who entered the ring and fought off Raven and Lee. Tyler then hugged The Sandman, bringing the eight-month-long storyline to a conclusion. = Independent circuit (2008-present) = Fullington returned to professional wrestling in 2008, and made his in-ring debut on August 23, 2008 for Pro Wrestling Unplugged, an independent promotion based in his hometown. Wrestling as \\"Twisted Sand\\" Tyler Fullington, his first match was a street fight with a wrestler named Kevin James. On June 27, 2009, Fullington was one of numerous ECW alumni to appear at \\"Legends of the Arena\\", a show held at the ECW Arena to raise money for the American Cancer Society. Tyler and his younger brother Oliver interfered in the main event, helping The Sandman and Sabu defeat Raven and Justin Credible.  Personal life  Fullington is the son of wrestler Jim \\"The Sandman\\" Fullington and valet Lori \\"Peaches\\" Fullington. He has two siblings: an older sister, Kelly, and a younger brother, Oliver.

Hosted by Les Dawson, it was an adaptation of an unsold pilot produced for US television in 1984 by Jay Wolpert. Gameplay Two teams of thirty people sat on stage. Les would ask who they had elected as their team captain and the captains would come up on stage. Each captain had thirty seconds in order to select four people for their team. The seconds would appear on what Dawson termed 'The Bridge' just above the set. The catch was that the captain had to split the thirty seconds into four different time limits and then choose which friend would answer the question. If they were wrong, they had to select someone else. If they were successful, that friend would be on the team. In the next round, the 'friends' and captains were all asked individual multi-choice questions. If the friends were right, they would stay on the team; if they are wrong, however, they would be sent, in Dawson's words, \\"off to the dump dock\\". However, a lifeline was offered, whereby if the captain was correct, the friend remained. The captain was never sent to the Dump Dock, but if he/she gave a wrong answer, he/she had to select a friend to send there. The first captain to lose all his/her friends lost the game, but everyone received a Fast Friends address book to take home. In the final round, the winning captain was joined by all his/her friends once again and they were given a selection of answers to a question on the video wall. Only one of the answers was incorrect and this must be avoided in order to ensure victory. Each of the friends would suggest an answer and the captain would decide whether to go with it or choose an alternative answer. If the team could choose all the correct answers, the captain won a holiday; otherwise, everyone won a mini-TV and of course the address book. The captain also won ¬£25 for each correct answer, and the friends who gave correct answers that the captain accepted also won ¬£25.

The 1st Tiger Brigade claims 181 destroyed or captured enemy tanks, 148 APCs, 40 artillery pieces, 27 AA emplacements, 263 Iraqi dead and 4,051 captured after 100 hours of combat.Smith, p. 89. The 2nd Marine Division lost 9 M60A1 tanks breaching the minefield. One M1A1 tank, belonging to the 2nd Armored Division's Tiger Brigade, was also damaged by a landmine. A pre planned counterattack by the 8th Mechanized Brigade of the Iraqi 3rd Armored Division attacked M1A1 tanks in the 2nd Marine Division's sector and was destroyed without loss, while the Marine 8th Tank Battalion destroyed other Iraqi tanks.M60 vs T-62 Cold War Combatants 1956-92 Nordeen&Isby; P.67 The Marine 3rd Tank Battalion destroyed an unknown number of Iraqi T-62 tanks around Al Jaber Airfield. On the second day of the U.S. advance a platoon from the Marine 8th Battalion destroyed 13 Iraqi tanks in a battle near a defensive position known as the Ice Tray.M60 vs T-62 Cold War Combatants 1956-92 Nordeen&Isby; P.72 Marine and Navy air power then inflicted heavy casualties on retreating Iraqi forces leading north out of Kuwait City. Later that night, some of the battles intensified as Marine forces surrounded the heavily defended Kuwait International Airport. U.S. Navy battleships offshore in the Persian Gulf pounded the airport hangars, terminals and other buildings, leaving them a shambles of twisted metal and blackened concrete in an effort to rout Iraqi forces from the field. Marine commanders said that cameras in remotely piloted aircraft that monitored the bombings showed Iraqis \\"literally jumping out of the tanks.\\" After the Marines commandeered the critical airfield, Special Forces teams arrived to counter snipers and other pockets of resistance that remained entrenched around the large airport complex. While Marine and Special Forces personnel were actively securing the airfield, Air Force communications personnel arrived and setup tactical air traffic control and landing systems to replace systems damaged by retreating Iraqi forces.Moore p.A01 The Marines lost 5 killed and 48 wounded in the three days of fighting, Marine officials said.Moore P.A01 Marine M60A1 tankers had tallied impressive totals against the Iraqi armored forces. The 1st Tank Battalion claimed 50 Iraqi T-55 and T-62 tanks and 25 APCs. The 3rd Battalion claimed 57 T-55s and T-62s(plus 5 T-72s), 7 APCs, and 10 trucks. The 8th Battalion destroyed more than three dozen tanks and a number of other vehicles. Additional Combat Operations On the third and final day of combat the 2nd Marine Division would liberate the city of Al Jahra then would go on to occupy the high ground on the Mutla Ridge cutting off the Iraqi escape route from Kuwait to Basra. M1A1 tanks would destroy the majority of the 166 Iraqi tanks that were claimed that day by the division. Iraqi General Ra'ad Hamdani commented on the armored engagement: \\"We had a problem of inflexibility of usage with the armored forces. We always favored tying the infantry to tank divisions.\\"  References  Sources *Col H.

It did not exist in the peacetime organization of the Polish Army, and was created for specific purposes only. Its task was to intervene in special circumstances, both inside Poland and outside of the country. Placement of Polish divisions on September 1, 1939 Composition According to the Mobilization Plan W, prepared for the war with the Soviet Union (see Plan East), the following units were designed to form the Intervention Corps: * 26th Infantry Division from Skierniewice, * 28th Infantry Division from Warsaw, * 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade from Rzesz√≥w. Furthermore, some artillery, armored and motorized regiments were to be added to the Corps, as well as three armored trains, engineer platoons and military police regiments. The Mobilization Plan W was completed on May 1, 1938, but its details have not been preserved. Operational history On March 22, 1939, Marshall Edward ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz signed Plan West for defense against the future invasion of Nazi Germany. All units marked with black in mobilization plan were designed to create the Main Reserve of the Commander in Chief (Odwod Glowny Naczelnego Wodza). On March 22, 1939, General Waclaw Stachiewicz, who at that time was the Chief of General Staff of the Polish Army (see Polish General Staff) ordered mobilization of all units marked with red and yellow, plus some of these marked with green and black. The mobilization began at 4 p.m., on March 23. In early July 1939, regiments of the 26th Division were transported from Kutno to WƒÖgrowiec and ≈ªnin, with the headquarters established at the elementary school in Wapno near Kcynia. At the same time, the 9th Division was transported to the area of Koronowo, and placed under authority of General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bortnowski, commander of Pomorze Army. Both divisions were planned to take part in the possible Polish intervention in the Free City of Danzig. Furthermore, in spring 1939 at the Bydgoszcz-Biedaszkowo Airport, a special Polish Airforce squadron was created. According to Polish historian Jerzy Pawlak, the Biedaszkowo Squadron was to join the Intervention Corps. On May 15, 1939, the squadron was transferred from Bydgoszcz to Toru≈Ñ, and on August 24, it was subjected to air command of Armia Pomorze. In the summer of 1939, some changes were made. The 26th Infantry Division was transferred to Pozna≈Ñ Army, and placed under authority of General Tadeusz Kutrzeba. The 28th Infantry Division was transferred to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army, commanded by General Juliusz R√≥mmel, while the 10th Motorized Brigade was moved southwards, to General Antoni Szylling of Krak√≥w Army. On August 13, 1939, Polish Army Headquarters officially formed the Intervention Corps, whose task was to protect Polish interests in the Free City of Danzig, including any attempts of seizing the city by the Third Reich. In case of a military conflict, Polish military authorities planned to enter the territory of the Free City. Since 26th and 28th Divisions, together with 10th Motorized Brigade, had been moved to other areas, two divisions from Second Military District were mobilized on August 14‚Äì16. These were: 13th Infantry Division from Rowne in Volhynia, and 27th Infantry Division, from Kowel, also in Volhynia. Both were on August 17 and 18 transported by rail to Pomerelia, and positioned in the area of Bydgoszcz ‚Äì Solec Kujawski ‚Äì Inowroc≈Çaw. They remained in combat readiness, with heavy equipment left on trains, ready to be transported northwards at any time. On August 24‚Äì27, the 27th I.D. was moved further northwards, to the area southwest of Starogard Gda≈Ñski. On August 28, headquarters of the Corps was established at Inowroc≈Çaw. Its commandant remained under direct authority of the General Inspector of the Armed Forces until the beginning of the war, when control of the Corps was to be passed to General Bortnowski. All activities of the Corps were to be protected by 9th Infantry Division from Siedlce, and Tuchola Detachment (see Czersk Operational Group), both of which were stationed to the southwest. According to Polish planners, the Corps was tasked with capturing Danzig after a quick assault from the area of Skarszewy ‚Äì Starogard Gda≈Ñski. On August 30, 1939, due to changes in the political situation, the Corps was disbanded, as Polish intervention in Danzig was cancelled. On August 31, 1939, at 8:50 a.m., Colonel Ignacy Izdebski of Toru≈Ñ Army Inspectorate, who was chief of staff of Pomorze Army, received a message from Polish General Staff. General Skwarczynski was ordered to come to Warsaw immediately, 13th I.D. was to be placed under authority of the Armed Forces headquarters, while 27th I.D. was transferred to Pomorze Army. Following this message, 13th I.D. was ordered to move from Bydgoszcz to the area of Koluszki, where Prusy Army was concentrated. The transfer began on September 1 at midday, and due to the activity of the Luftwaffe and widespread destruction of rail links, it was not fully completed until the night of September 5/6. Meanwhile, 27th I.D. was ordered to abandon its positions south of Danzig, and walk across the Tuchola Forest to the area of Toru≈Ñ. The division began its march on the first day of the war, and this delay resulted in its eventual destruction.

J. Verhaegen, Pierre Joseph Verhagen, Pi√®rre Joseph Verhaghen, Pierre-Joseph Verhaegen, Pierre Joseph Verhaghen, Pietro Giuseppe Verhagen (19 March 1728 in Aarschot ‚Äì 3 April 1811 in Leuven)Pi√®rre Joseph Verhaghen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History was a Flemish painter of large-scale religious and mythological scenes. He is regarded as the last representative of the so-called Flemish School of painting. In particular, he is seen as continuing the artistic tradition of Flemish Baroque painting as exemplified by Rubens in the late 18th century and into the 19th century. He was highly regarded during his lifetime and enjoyed the patronage of eminent patrons and religious institutions. He was appointed first court painter to Empress Maria Theresa of Austria who also provided him a stipend to travel abroad to further his artistic studies.Pieter-Jozef Verhaghen, in het spoor van Rubens at M Museum Life Lot and his daughters Pieter-Jozef Verhaghen was born in Aarschot on 19 March 1728. Grandfather and father Verhaghen belonged to the notables of the city and practised as surgeons. The two sons of the family broke with the family tradition and opted to become painters. Jan-Jozef Verhaghen, older brother of Pieter-Jozef, is known in the history of 18th century painting as Potteke (little pot) Verhaghen, because in his works he often depicted kitchen utensils, pots and bowls of earthenware, copper and tin.Dani Vandepoel, Pieter-Jozef Verhaghen: in het spoor van Rubens in: Leuven historisch, year 8, March 2011, p. 22-24 Pieter-Jozef Verhaghen thanked his artist career to a chance meeting. As a young boy, he very much enjoyed drawing. When in 1741 he learned that the traveling painter and art restorer Jan-Baptist van den Kerckhoven (c. 1709-1772) was working to restore a painting in the Church of Our Lady in Aarschot he showed van den Kerckhoven some of his drawings. Van den Kerckhoven immediately recognized the boy's artistic talent and convinced father Willem Verhaghen to let his son study the principles of painting. The young Verhaghen stayed with Van den Kerckhoven and travelled with him to other cities nearby working on decorations and restorations. When van den Kerckhoven was called to some job further away, Verhaghen was not allowed by his father to travel with him due to his young age. He spent the next two years studying art by making copies after prints.Edward Van Even, De schilder P.-J. Verhaghen, zijn leven en zijne werken, Karel Fonteyn, 1875 In 1744 he moved to Antwerp where he continued his training with Balthasar Beschey. Beschey was an upcoming painter who worked in the style of Rubens and even made direct copies after the famous Antwerp master. As part of his training in Beschey's workshop Verhaghen made studies after 17th-century works.Veronique Vandekerchove, Peter Carpreau, Thomas Matei, In het spoor van Rubens, Pieter-Jozef Verhaghen, M - Museum Leuven, 2011 He was simultaneously enrolled at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp where he learned to draw after models. His brother Jan-Jozef later also moved to Antwerp where he worked while taking art classes. In 1747 Pieter-Jozef left Antwerp to return to Aarschot to live with his parents. The adoration of the Magi In 1749, he was summoned to Leuven where brewer Guilliam Vrancx asked him to decorate the salons of his house on the Mechelsestraat with decorative paintings in Louis XV style. Vrancx was an influential business man and later mayor of Leuven who provided the young artist with an excellent introduction to the bourgeois milieu in Leuven. Not long after his move to Leuven, Verhaghen met and fell in love with Johanna Hensmans, the daughter of a brandy distiller. Rather than return to Antwerp to take up his studies again, the artist decided to stay in Leuven where the couple were married in 1753. Seven children (four sons and three daughters) were the issue of this marriage. The couple settled in Leuven where Verhaghen opened a small workshop while his wife ran an yarn and linen shop. In 1754 the artist became formally a citizen of Leuven. In these early years of his career Verhaghen was mainly active as a decorative painter. He counted among his patrons members of the bourgeoisie as well as from the circle of the University of Leuven. For the University's graduates who were not from the aristocracy he painted coats of arms, which they could hang above their house door. He also started to receive commissions for larger works with religious themes, in which he was be able to give free rein to his creativity. These works include 11 paintings for the chapel of Leuven University, two canvases for the chapter hall of the Park Abbey and a series of paintings for the Dominican church in Leuven. These works show that his artistic aspiration was to paint in the style of his artistic examples, Rubens and Gaspar de Crayer. He took de Crayer as his example as there were multiple works of this artist present in the churches of Leuven. He gradually also found patronage outside Leuven and its immediate surroundings and painted altarpieces for churches in Turnhout, Halle and Ghent. He was also active as a portrait painter. Hungarian king St Stephen receiving the Pope's envoys bringing him the crown The Brussels banker and art lover Daniel Danoot introduced Pieter-Jozef Verhaghen to Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, Governor of the Austrian Netherlands. At the time Verhaghen had been working on a commission for the duke Karl von Koblenz depicting the Hungarian king St Stephen receiving the Pope's envoys bringing him the crown. When von Koblenz died before Verhaghen had delivered the commission, he offered the finished work to Prince Charles. Prince Charles wrote to Austrian Empress Empress Maria Theresa to ask for permission to purchase the work. The Austrian Empress Empress Maria Theresa agreed to the request and when she later was sent the work, she was taken by its qualities. She decided to support the artistic development of the artist by funding a study trip to Italy. He was awarded a stipend that would cover the living expenses of the artist and his family for a period of two years. In May 1771 Verhaghen was made the ordinary painter of Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine. In the same month he set out on his trip together with his eldest son Willem who would later become a priest. Travelling first to Paris he then continued via Lyon to Turin. Here he was received at the court of Sardinia. He then travelled on to Milan, Parma, Piacenza, Bologna to arrive in Rome at the beginning of August 1771.Paola Moreno, Il viaggio di Verhaghen a Napoli, in: Incontri (2012) He stayed in Rome for one and a half years and visited Napels during that period. While in Rome, Pope Clement XIV granted the artist an audience and he offered plenary indulgence to him, his family in the third degree, and thirty other people of his choice. The pope also personally gave the artist's son Willem a tonsure. Hagar and Ishmael banished by Abraham Subsequently Verhaghen travelled to Vienna via Tuscany and Venice. He arrived in Vienna on 9 June 1773. Here the Empress received him in audience two times. She honored him by bestowing the title of 'first court painter' on him. When he returned home in October 1773, he was welcomed as a kind of national hero in various cities, including his native city Aarschot, his hometown Leuven and Antwerp. The Leuven painter and poet Martin van Dorne composed a short didactic poem, in which he evoked all the works executed by the prolific Verhaghen.F√©lix Stappaerts, Martin van Dorne in: Biographie nationale de Belgique His reputation had increased enormously and many institutions wanted to own paintings by his hand. His reputation grew also outside his own country. His success were supported by his ability to paint quickly and his efficient workshop organization in which he followed the example of his teacher Balthasar Beschey. Religious institutions were his most important customers, so his career suffered from the Austrian government's efforts to curb the influence of the Catholic Church. The invasion of the Southern Netherlands by French troops in the 1790s further affected the artist's career. Two of his sons, Willem, parish priest in Schaerbeek, and Joris-Jozef, canon of the Park Abbey had to shelter in the artist's home to escape persecution of the French administrators. After the Concordat of 1801 entered into between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII in 1801, the religious tensions decreased and Pieter-Jozef was able to get some new orders, especially from private individuals. But the time for his great historical compositions had passed. After on 26 October 1800 artist from Leuven such as Martin van Dorne, Fran√ßois Xavier Joseph Jacquin, Josse-Pieter Geedts, Frans Berges, Gillis Goyers and Antoon Clevenbergh had established a society for the establishment of an academy in Leuven, Verhaghen was elected its honorary director. After suffering a stroke in 1809, the artist was no longer to work in the last years of his life. He also lost his oldest son and wife in the year 1810. By the time he died on 3 April 1811, the interest in his work had been in decline for a while.Joost de Geest, In het spoor van Rubens. Pieter-Jozef Verhaghen in M Leuven en Parkabdij at tento Work The magnanimity of Scipio Africanus Verhaghen was a very prolific painter who created religious and mythological compositions as well as some portraits. He painted over 300 works during his lifetime and was thus one of the most productive painters of the Austrian Netherlands. The master excelled mainly in his large history paintings for which he was in demand throughout Flanders. He was less successful as a portrait painter since his creations were deemed not to produce good likenesses to the sitters. The portraits of abbot Simon Wouters van the Park Abbey and Adriaan Trudo Sal√© of Averbode Abbey are rare examples of Verhaghen's portrait work. Both portraits date from 1779 and show the abbots in their study room or library. The abbots are depicted with the symbols of their religious status. He was appreciated in his time as a great colorist and one of the most important painters working in the Southern Netherlands. Stylistically he is regarded as one of the last members of the Flemish Baroque and his style is indebted to the works of the great Flemish masters of the 17th century such as Rubens, van Dyck, Jordaens and Caspar de Crayer. He thus sided with other artists of his time such as Willem Jacob Herreyns who continued the Flemish tradition of the Antwerp school against artists such as Cornelis Cels who sought inspiration in new artistic currents such as the Academic style popularized in France. Many of his works are still on display at many churches and religious institutions throughout Belgium including the Saint Quentin's Church in Leuven, Averbode Abbey and Park Abbey in Heverlee.

He was born on May 16, 1913 in Douglasville, Georgia, the son of Will and Cora Reid Johnson. The family moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 1916. His mother died when he was young, and he with his elder and younger sister were raised by his paternal grandmother, Sarah Farley Johnson. His father, Will, was a shape note teacher in Georgia in the 1920s and 1930s. He first acted as pastor at the age of 12 at the Antioch Baptist Church in Barnesville, Georgia. He was pastor in 14 churches, including his own foundation of the St Joseph's Missionary Baptist Church. In his early twenties, he married Elizabeth Daniels; that union yielded four children: two boys and two girls. In 1939, he began a 20-year effort to complete his formal education, studying for the ministry at Morehouse School of Religion, the American Theological Seminary, and the Carver Bible Institute, culminating in a Doctor of Divinity degree. Although he had been active in Georgia since his early years, he only gained wider prominence from 1964, when he came to the attention of Fred Mendelsohn, then executive producer at Savoy Records. He recorded at least 20 albums, all of which were recorded in his church rather than in a recording studio. Although most of his recorded songs are traditional, 26 are listed as his own compositions. JSTOR archive. His 1970 recording of \\"I Wanna Go Where Jesus Is\\" was a gold-selling record.

Plot summary Newcomers to Los Angeles Alex and Emily think they have found new friends when Kurt and Charlotte, an eccentric couple, invite them over to their house for a playdate between their sons. After the children fall asleep, passion and decadence ensue in an increasingly humorous and zany series of encounters. Once the couples' children have fallen asleep, Kurt and Charlotte introduce a bong and the four adults get high. Soon after they get in the pool and Kurt insists on skinny dipping, which Alex is very hesitant to do for fear of exposing his small penis. Emily joins Charlotte on an errand to pick up more alcohol, but Charlotte stops off at a massage parlor, where she masturbates a man while Emily watches through a peephole. Back at the house, Emily warns Alex that Kurt and Charlotte are swingers. Alex and Emily argue about their sex life before Kurt reveals that he is sexually attracted to Alex. Slowly, the four adults begin to engage in an orgy, but their children burst into the room, the morning having arrived. Days later, Alex and Emily run into Kurt, Charlotte and their son at the park, and share an amiable exchange.

The entrant for the Czech Republic at Eurovision 2015, \\"Hope Never Dies\\" is the fourth song to be entered by the Czech Republic in Eurovision and is the third to be sung in English rather than in Czech. The song failed to qualify for the final. With \\"Hope Never Dies\\" the Czech Republic returns to Eurovision for the fourth time after a six-year absence from the contest following three consecutive low placings in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 editions of Eurovision (see Czech Republic in the Eurovision Song Contest). The Czech national broadcaster ƒåT had announced in July 2014 that they would not be sponsoring an entrant in Eurovision 2015: however in a 19 November 2014 announcement ƒåT stated that a Czech entrant for Eurovision 2015 would be chosen by an expert panel of jurors from a field of five specially commissioned nominees. This marked the first time that there had been no national preliminary round to select the Eurovision entrant for the Czech Republic (although the previous Czech entrant at Eurovision: the 2009 entrant \\"Aven Romale\\" by Gypsy.cz, had only vied in the national preliminary with one other song). The selection of \\"Hope Never Dies\\" as the entrant for the Czech Republic at Eurovision 2015 was announced on 31 January 2015. The jurors reportedly were not made aware of the composer of the songs in contention until after the selection for the 2015 Eurovision entrant for the Czech Republic had been made. Juror Michael Koc√°b stated: \\"The songs we were choosing from were quite on par with each other in my opinion. However, the winning song 'Hope Never Dies' was a candidate of mine too. It sports a peculiar and nice chorus, along with some nice and surprising modulation. And when I heard it, I figured that this song can really impress if done well.\\" Despite another failure to qualify for the Grand Final, \\"Hope Never Dies\\" was indeed an improvement of results of the Czech entry, scoring 33 points in the Semifinal 2 compared to maximum of 9 in 2008. Best placing of 13th was also achieved, in comparison to two 18th ones.

Despite this, she seems to have been known to many of the literati of the day, whose names are listed as subscribers to her two collections. James Boswell records that Dr. Johnson, whom she occasionally visited, revised her volumes and \\"illuminated them here and there with a ray of his own genius\\"; that association on its own, and the entry on Boswell's Life appear to have given Masters' name (if not her life and work) some historical currency. She is also associated with editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, Edward Cave, and whose house was one of a number in which she resided when visiting London. In her Familiar Letters and Poems upon several Occasions (London, 1755) there are three \\"Short Ejaculations\\", the first of which, the well-known 'Tis religion that can give Sweetest pleasures while we live, has been adopted in many hymnals. The original consists of six lines only; two more were added in John Rippon's Selection of Hymns (1787), and the eight lines divided into two stanzas, in which form the hymn is now known. An ejaculation for use At the Altar, and beginning, \\"my ador'd Redeemer! deign to be\\", is sometimes met with. She is spoken of, in the Monthly Review, as \\"chaste, moral, and religious\\", and \\"an agreeable and ingenious writer\\". She is noted as a letter- writer, and in her epistles expresses proto-feminist views. She is supposed to have died about 1759.

Inspired by the life and work of artist Georgia O'Keeffe, the title is derived from the name of O'Keeffe's New Mexico summer home, Ghost Ranch. The piece was commissioned by BBC Radio 3, completed in 2005, and premiered February 8, 2006 in Poole, United Kingdom, with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra led by conductor Marin Alsop.. Composition Ghost Ranch is composed in three movements: I. \\"Bone,\\" II. \\"Above Clouds,\\" and III. \\"Black Rattle.\\" The composition of the piece was designed to musically illustrate the visuals of O'Keeffe's paintings, such as the rattle of animal bones, barking coyotes, and the rigid, vast landscapes of the American West.

The position was the brainchild of Velma McPeek, the Burlington's Supervisor of Passenger Train Services, and was part of an effort to attract families to rail travel and accommodate their needs. Zephyrettes first appeared on the Denver Zephyr in 1936, and shortly thereafter on the Twin Cities Zephyr, but the position was discontinued during World War II. Zephyrettes resumed service after the war in 1949, but only on the California Zephyr. To qualify, a prospective Zephyrette had to fulfill a variety of criteria, from being single and either a college graduate or a registered nurse to being between 24 and 28 years old and between and tall. Once employed, Zephyrettes were expected to conduct themselves with \\"dignity and poise\\" and also refrain from smoking or drinking while in uniform, among other requirements. Somewhat akin to an air line stewardess, the roles played by a Zephyrette were many, from hostess and tour guide to first aid responder and babysitter. The Zephyrettes became lasting symbols of the California Zephyr, wearing distinctive uniforms and appearing in both promotional literature and magazine advertisements, and they would remain a constant presence on the train until it was discontinued on March 22, 1970. A number married other railroad employees or former passengers, and one even had the honor of christening Amtrak's inaugural California Zephyr on July 17, 1983.  Background  A promotional postcard for the Denver Zephyr, the first train to feature Zephyrettes The position of Zephyrette was predated by other pioneering positions open to women in the American railroad industry. The \\"Harvey Girls\\" had been employed by Harvey Houses along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway since the 1880s, although they were not part of the railroad's on-board crew. In August 1935, the Union Pacific Railroad began its groundbreaking employment of \\"nurse-stewardesses\\" aboard passenger trains when it hired Florette Welp. In order to qualify, women interested in the position had to be registered nurses between the ages of 21 and 24. The name \\"Zephyrette\\" is derived from the Zephyr trains run by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, beginning with the revolutionary streamlined, stainless steel, diesel-powered Pioneer Zephyr that debuted in 1934. After the Pioneer Zephyr made its historic dawn-to-dusk run from Denver to Chicago in May 1934, coinciding with the Century of Progress International Exposition, the Burlington decided to implement an overnight Denver Zephyr between the two cities in 1936. Burlington management also arrived at the conclusion that the future of passenger rail travel would be largely dependent on successfully attracting families and accommodating their needs, not just serving businessmen. Desiring to put a woman in a management position to help achieve this goal, the Burlington hired Velma McPeek, a former schoolteacher and manager of a department store tea room, as its new Supervisor of Passenger Train Services. One of McPeek's first initiatives was to create a corps of hostesses who would serve as liaisons between a train's passengers and the conductor while endeavoring to make themselves \\"helpful and generally agreeable with the passengers\\". It was this corps of hostesses who would become the Zephyrettes.  Trains and schedule  Western Pacific power in 1949, the first year that Zephyrettes were assigned to the train The Zephyrettes made their debut on the Denver Zephyr in 1936,Zimmerman, Karl (2004). Burlington's Zephyrs, MBI Publishing Company, pp. 57-59. . and shortly thereafter appeared on the Twin Cities Zephyr as well. The position was discontinued during World War II, as domestic passenger rail service was reduced to essentially the bare necessities as American railroads tried to conserve resources for the war effort while also providing for the movement of military personnel across the country on troop trains. After the end of the war, McPeek was instrumental in restoring the Zephyrettes to the Burlington's passenger service, albeit only on the California Zephyr. The Zephyrettes would be a constant presence on the train from 1949 until it was discontinued in 1970. They constituted one of a number of McPeek's efforts to make the train more friendly to women, children, and families; some of her other ideas were successful, such as lowering the height of car windows to allow for easier viewing, while others were not, such as setting aside a portion of one car for women and children only. The Zephyrettes were hired in Chicago, first by McPeek and later by her successor, Mary Lou Gordon. While the California Zephyr was jointly operated by the Burlington, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, and the Western Pacific Railroad, the Zephyrettes were technically Western Pacific employees and thus paid in San Francisco. At any one time, there were 10 or 11 Zephyrettes who were actively employed, with six in transit aboard trains (three heading in either direction) and two on layovers (one in San Francisco and the other in Chicago), and perhaps also an occasional trainee. A typical itinerary for a Zephyrette consisted of the two and a half day trip on the eastbound California Zephyr, a night layover at the Hilton Chicago, another two and a half day trip westbound, and then two and a half days off in San Francisco. Over the course of a month, a Zepyhrette would generally make three round trips. Some Zephyrettes worked other jobs while not aboard the California Zephyr: one, Rita Pelz, modeled for I. Magnin. The average tenure of employment for a Zephyrette was one and a half years, but some served much longer: Nellie O'Grady was already in her seventh year with the California Zephyr when she wrote about her experiences in the December 1955 issue of The Saturday Evening Post.  Qualifications and requirements  Zephyrette Nellie O'Grady interacting with a passenger in 1956 In order to qualify, prospective Zephyrettes originally had to be single, either college graduates or trained as registered nurses, between 24 and 28 years of age, between and tall, and of \\"good character with a pleasing personality\\". Some of these criteria were eventually relaxed, however, as Jane Smith was hired at age 23 in 1958 and Cathy Moran had not finished college when hired in 1969. Smith was initially recruited by American Airlines as a stewardess, but did not enjoy flying. The original class of Zephyrettes completed a 30-day training course prior to beginning their duties, while all subsequently hired employees received only on-the-job training from an experienced Zephyrette. Once employed, Zephyrettes were required to conduct themselves with \\"dignity and poise\\", refrain from smoking or drinking while in uniform, and avoid fraternizing with passengers while they were drinking. Perhaps not coincidentally, Zephyrette Julie Ann Lyman observed that her greatest cravings upon disembarking the train in San Francisco, aside from a bath (the train had no bathing facilities), were for a cigarette and a glass of wine. Zephyrettes were also forbidden to receive tips from passengers, although they were permitted to accept cards and gifts. McPeek, who was affectionately referred to as \\"Mama\\" McPeek by many Zephyrettes, was quite protective of them and did not hesitate to write them letters of advice and encouragement; she was especially concerned about the effects of gossip on the Zephyrettes.  Duties  A Zephyrette at work in 1961 Described by Lyman as \\"the railroad's answer to the air line stewardess\\", some of the many duties of a Zephyrette included welcoming passengers, making announcements on the train's public address system, sending telegrams, and taking dinner reservations, which on the California Zephyr was a complicated undertaking due to the system of multiple seatings necessitated by the relative lack of space in the dining car. Zephyrettes were also responsible for communicating with the conductors to ensure that passengers boarding at intermediate stations were not neglected, providing for parlor games such as bridge or canasta, and babysitting children and sometimes even pets. Near the end of the California Zephyr's existence, as equipment failures ranging from malfunctioning heaters to public address systems became more common, they essentially became apologists for the train itself. Generally, Zephyrettes also served as liaisons between new passengers who were unfamiliar with railroading conventions and the various other members of the crew, such as porters. Zephyrettes played a variety of different roles, from hostess and tour guide to first aid responder and babysitter, giving attention to all passengers, often with an emphasis on the handicapped, elderly, and children. Sometimes what was required of them was as simple as providing directions; Smith joked that if she had written a memoir about her experiences as a Zephyrette, she would have entitled it Which Way is the Diner?, noting that was a frequent question even in the Dome-Observation car (the last car on the train). Other times it was much more difficult; in 1955, Zephyrette Helen Schwartz, with the assistance of porter Roosevelt Williams and two female passengers, successfully delivered a baby on the train outside of Grand Junction, Colorado. That child, Peter Zars, would return to the California Zephyr to celebrate his seventh birthday, again with the assistance of a Zephyrette. Due to the train's prestige, famous passengers were quite common, and Zephyrettes interacted with them directly, from Bernard Baruch and Pierre Monteux to Mamie Eisenhower and professional baseball players. O'Grady analogized the duties of a Zephyrette to \\"being hostess to a house party of 300 self-invited guests whom you don't know\\". Lyman described her experience on a 1963 California Zephyr trip as \\"48 hours answering every wish and whim of the 287 passengers\\", and then estimated that she walked while performing her duties. O'Grady wore a pedometer on three consecutive round trips, over which she had walked a total of . At the end of her 16-hour workday, the Zephyrette would retire to her personal quarters at the rear of the Dome-Buffet car, next to the sleeping quarters reserved for the train's chefs and waiters. Every evening, she would prepare a detailed daily report focusing on passenger needs, which was then forwarded to the railroad's management offices in Chicago for the purpose of assessing and adjusting the California Zephyr's various features and services. The train's Zephyrette officially went off duty at approximately 10 pm, although she could still be summoned overnight via her call bell, and often was.  Uniform  O'Grady wearing her military-style hat, 1956 The original, pre-World War II Zephyrette uniforms differed seasonally: during winter, they consisted of gray suits with red, silk-lined capes, while in the summer they were lightweight white silk suits paired with navy blouses. The resumption of Zephyrette service on the California Zephyr in 1949 came with an entirely new uniform, which consisted of two-piece teal blue suits worn with military-style hats, monogrammed white blouses, and Zephyr pins. Over the years, these uniforms gradually evolved: the skirts became shorter, the design of the hats changed, and the monograms disappeared altogether. In 1963, Gordon collaborated with tailor Ralph Helperin to completely redesign the uniforms, giving them a more modern appearance, complete with a brighter shade of blue. Later in the 1960s, the uniforms were changed to brown. In 1970, the last year of operation for the California Zephyr, Moran wore airline-inspired dresses, one blue with a white stripe down the side and the other green with a similar orange stripe, that she believes would have become the regular uniform had the train continued for another year. Legacy The Zephyrettes became symbols of the California Zephyr, and appeared in both the train's promotional literature and a few magazine advertisements. They remained a constant presence on the train until the very end, on March 22, 1970, when the final California Zephyr completed its last trip at Chicago Union Station. While the average tenure of employment for a Zephyrette was only one and a half years, many made lasting connections on the train, and some married other railroad employees or former passengers. Moran married a brakeman who also served on the California Zephyr, Ernie von Ibsch, after he initially asked her out on a date the very night the train was discontinued. On July 17, 1983, former Zephyrette Beulah Bauman was chosen to christen Amtrak's California Zephyr before it departed Denver Union Station on its inaugural journey. Furthermore, in 2011, a group of former Zephyrettes held their first reunion in San Francisco. In 2013, approximately 20 attended a second Zephyrette reunion in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, where they visited the Glenwood Springs Railway Museum inside the city's Amtrak station.

The episode was written by Heather Bellson and directed by Julius Ramsay. In the episode, the group of Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) are exhausted and dehydrated from their journey to Washington, D.C., while several members of the group continue to grieve over the group's recent losses and question their chances of survival. The episode primarily centers on the characters of Maggie, Sasha, and Daryl dealing with the losses of Beth and Tyreese. It also focuses on Glenn's sinking depression and giving up hope, while Abraham becomes intensely reclusive and Michonne's struggles to keep holding onto hope. It also features the introduction of Ross Marquand as Aaron, a prominent character from the graphic novel the television series is based on. Plot The group continues to reel from the deaths of Beth Greene (Emily Kinney) and Tyreese (Chad Coleman), with Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan), Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green), and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) taking the losses the hardest. 60 miles away from Washington, D.C., the survivors' van runs out of gas, forcing them to travel on foot in the midst of a drought. With almost no water, they begin to question their chances of survival. Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) attempts to console Maggie, but she chastises him for abandoning his flock when the outbreak occurred. Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) orchestrates a plan to eliminate the threat of a pursuing herd of walkers, which will require minimal exertion from the exhausted group. However, Sasha breaks from the working plan with recklessness that leads to several group members' narrowly avoiding bites, and Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz) is wounded when Sasha cuts him unapologetically. Sasha is angrily rebuked by Michonne (Danai Gurira), who warns her not to end up like Sasha's brother, Tyreese. Later, the group sit in a ditch by the road, all still hungry and without food when a pack of feral dogs, one a Doberman Pinscher still wearing a collar, appear across the road. Daryl pulls out his knife but flinches and looks away as Sasha dispatches the dogs with a silenced weapon before they can get any closer. Rick stands up and begins to collect branches to make a fire. In the next scene they are shown to be cooking meat on the fire and eating and, as the camera pans out, Noah is seen to be sitting on the ground with them and staring at a blue dog collar that is lying, discarded, in the dirt. As they eat, Father Gabriel throws his priest collar into the fire, signifying his lost faith. Despite comfort from Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), a grieving Daryl begins to self-harm and when alone breaks down in tears. Dangerously dehydrated, the survivors find four jugs and ten bottles of water waiting for them in the middle of the road with a note reading, \\"from a friend\\". Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt) volunteers to drink the water himself to see if it's safe but is stopped by Abraham amidst concerns it may be a trap. That night, a heavy thunderstorm breaks out, allowing the survivors to replenish their water supplies before taking shelter in a nearby barn. There, Rick relates a story of his grandfather, who fought in World War II and only survived by convincing himself that he was already a dead man. Rick instructs the group that like his grandfather, they have to live with reality, to \\"do what they have to do\\", and tell themselves they \\"are the walking dead\\". Daryl angrily rejects Rick's notion, insisting that they aren't \\"them.\\" A herd of walkers is then spotted approaching the barn; the group works together to fend them off by barricading the door. The next morning, the survivors discover the storm itself has destroyed the walkers, throwing them onto broken branches and uprooting trees on top of them while narrowly sparing the barn. While watching the sunrise, Sasha tells Maggie that she doesn't know how to carry on. The two are then approached by a man named Aaron (Ross Marquand), who identifies himself as a \\"friend\\" and asks for Rick by name. They point their guns at him suspiciously. Reception Sonequa Martin-Green received praise for her performance as Sasha in this episode. =Viewership= Ross Marquand made his first appearance as Aaron in this episode. Upon airing, the episode was watched by 12.27 million American viewers with an 18-49 rating of 6.2, a decrease in viewership from the previous episode which had 15.64 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 8.0. In Australia, the episode was watched by 70,000 viewers, making it the second most-watched broadcast on pay television that day. The UK broadcast was the third most-watched on the network that month, with 893,000 viewers. =Critical reception= The episode received generally positive reviews, with many praising aspects such as the theme of grief, the introduction of Aaron at the end and the sequences involving the barn and Sasha fuelling her rage on the zombies. Laura Prudom for Variety commented positively on the episode calling it \\"contemplative but emotionally satisfying.\\" On his review for the episode, Ron Hogan for Den of Geek commented positively on the episode's themes and felt that Sonequa Martin- Green delivered the best performance of the episode. Rebecca Hawkes of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode 4 stars calling it \\"mystical\\". She felt that the episode \\"raised interesting questions about whether a life based on survival is little better than being dead\\", referring to the scene where Rick refers to the survivors as \\"the walking dead\\", referencing the title of the series. She further assessed that \\"while Gabriel may have rejected religion, it was in fact an episode filled with oddly religious, hope-inspiring moments, including the fortuitous arrival of a rain storm just when the group were struggling with their thirst. A sequence in which Daryl, Maggie and Sasha held a barn door close against an onslaught of walkers had a dreamlike, mystical quality.\\" She praised the ending scene, calling it \\"refreshing\\" that the series \\"is returning to a more plot-driven formula.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN reacted positively to Rick's speech, the scene involving Sasha taking out her rage on the zombies and the introduction of Aaron from the comic book series. Although, he felt the episode covered old ground. Overall, he gave the episode a 7.6 out of 10. USA Today also enjoyed the scene involving Sasha, and called Aaron's scene an \\"exciting new development\\".

The episode was written by Seth Hoffman, in his fifth writing credit for the series, and directed by Larysa Kondracki. This episode marks the first appearance of the Alexandria Safe-Zone, a prominent location in the comic book series of the same name. It also features the first appearance of Eric, a recruiter for Alexandria and Aaron's boyfriend. The episode focuses on the group's being introduced to Aaron, who promises the group would be valuable additions to his community, although his encouraging and optimistic outlook convince the group that he is a threat. Michonne strives for a safe haven and believes in the opportunity Aaron's community offers. The group take a different route than expected for safety precautions, which in turn causes multiple dangerous threats along their journey. Overall, the episode was critically acclaimed, with many praising aspects such as the action and sense of urgency, as well as the change of tone in comparison to previous episodes demonstrating hope for the characters and moving the story in a new direction. Plot Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) return to the barn and introduce Aaron (Ross Marquand) to Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and the group. Aaron tells them he is part of a larger community surrounded by reinforced steel walls that provide protection from intruders and \\"roamers\\", and he believes they would make trustworthy additions to his community. Rick, however, doesn't trust Aaron and knocks him unconscious before tying him to a wooden column. A search of Aaron's pack reveals, among other things, a flare gun, suggesting there are others nearby. When later pressed by Rick, Aaron reveals he has one partner who is hiding some distance from the group. He provides Rick with directions to two waiting vehicles, which are to transport Rick's group to the community. Rick tests Aaron's claim by dispatching Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun), Maggie, Michonne (Danai Gurira), Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz), and Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos) to see if the vehicles are in fact there, while the rest of the group takes up positions around the barn, in case Aaron is planning an attack. A car and an RV are later found, suggesting that Aaron is telling the truth. While alone with Rick, Aaron explains that he worked for an NGO delivering food and medicine to communities on the Niger River delta, and bad guys pointed guns at his face every other week ‚Äî but he doesn't believe Rick is a bad guy. When everyone reconvenes, Aaron says he will take them to the community the next morning, but he refuses to reveal the camp's location in order to protect its inhabitants. Instead, Aaron says they'll take Highway 16 and provide further directions as they travel. However, Rick decides against that and declares they will travel via Highway 23 that night. Aaron protests, saying that his people haven't yet cleared that road, but Rick is adamant. An angry Michonne questions whether Rick actually intends to join the camp. Rick responds that he will make a decision when he is outside the walls. Rick, Michonne, Glenn, and Aaron take the lead in the car, while the rest of the group follow a short distance behind in the RV. On the way, Michonne is looking at the pictures that Aaron has given her and she asks him why he has no pictures of his people. He says that he did take one picture but that he had got the exposure wrong and it didn't develop. Michonne then asks Rick if he has given Aaron their own audition interview: How many walkers have you killed? How many people have you killed? Why? Rick says no and then Michonne asks Aaron those questions. He answers that he has killed 'lots' of walkers, but only two people, and only then because they were trying to kill him. At that point Rick then finds a parabolic microphone in the car and expresses concern that Aaron's people might have heard their plans. Rick's outburst distracts Glenn who drives into a herd of walkers spread-out along the dark, unscouted highway. Coming out the other side, they lose sight of the RV and conclude it backed away from the herd, and as they discuss a way to rendezvous with them find they can't get the car started. They see a flare go off and Aaron bolts into the woods, pursued by Glenn. After close calls for each, Glenn cuts Aaron free and returns his pistol, and together they return to the car to save Rick and Michonne from the herd. The four of them head for the flare and reunite with the RV group who have rescued Aaron's partner and boyfriend, Eric (Jordan Woods-Robinson). Relieved that Rick's group saved Eric, Aaron reveals the community is located in Alexandria, Virginia, and the group hits the road in the morning. During a break, Rick slips away and hides a gun in the woods. Pulling up to the community walls, Rick hears the sound of children playing. Believing that Aaron is telling the truth and the community is safe, the group leave the vehicles and heads to the gates. Reception Although Aaron and Eric are boyfriends in the comic series, many fans were still surprised due to the same-sex kiss the two shared in the episode. Upon airing, the episode was watched by 13.44 million American viewers with an 18-49 rating of 6.9, an increase in viewership from the previous episode which had 12.27 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 6.2. In New Zealand, the episode was watched by 150,020 viewers. The Australian broadcast was the most- watched on pay television that day, with 85,000 viewers.

It was written by Channing Powell and directed by Greg Nicotero. In the episode, the group enters the Alexandria Safe-Zone and struggles to adapt to the community's normality and lifestyle, as well as distrusts their environment. Several group members are interviewed by the shrewd former congresswoman, Alexandria leader, Deanna Monroe (Tovah Feldshuh), as they are given houses to live in. The episode introduces many prominent characters from Robert Kirkman's original source material, including Nicholas (Michael Traynor), Olivia (Ann Mahoney), Jessie Anderson (Alexandra Breckenridge) and her family, as well as a remixed version of the Monroes. It heavily adapts material from Volume 12 \\"Life Among Them\\", with major differences being the use of original characters such as Daryl Dixon and his struggle to adapt.http://www.thewalkingdead.com/episode-512-panel-to-screen-comparison/ Commentators lauded the episode, citing the introduction to the community and a new safe haven as providing fresh storytelling and a change in tone for the rest of the series. Several critics adulated Carol Peletier's character development and Melissa McBride's acting. The episode also saw a rise in ratings from the previous episode with 14.43 million viewers in comparison to 13.44 million viewers in the previous week. This episode marks the debut of the young actress Katelyn Nacon who plays Enid, an exclusive character for the television series. Plot Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and the group enter the Alexandria Safe-Zone and are met by Nicholas (Michael Traynor), who asks the group to surrender their weapons. When Rick refuses, Aaron (Ross Marquand) suggests he first meets their leader, Deanna Monroe (Tovah Feldshuh). Deanna, who first discloses to Rick that she was a former Ohio congressperson, explains that Northern Virginia was effectively evacuated but the Army redirected her to the recently constructed planned community with its own solar grid, water cisterns and eco-based sewage filtration. Her architect husband Reg started building the walls and they've been lucky with very few people around, living or dead. Deanna interviews the group members individually, documenting the conversations on camera. During his interview, Rick warns her not to accept strangers, to which she retorts that he is already protecting the Safe-Zone. While being interviewed, Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) lies about her past, implying that she has few survival skills and was merely a \\"den mother\\" for the group. After hesitantly surrendering the weapons, the survivors are given housing, complete with electricity and hot water, and begin meeting the other residents. An elderly couple are enthused about Judith, having not seen a baby for a long time. Rick meets Jessie Anderson (Alexandra Breckenridge), a former stylist who gives him a haircut, while Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) meets the local youth, whose latest member is Enid (Katelyn Nacon), a young survivor recently brought in from the outside. While pleased with their protection, the group is unimpressed with the residents' survival skills, especially Carl, who notes to his father that the comfort in which they live has made them weak. Carl notices Enid sneaking out of the Safe-Zone and follows her over the wall but loses track of her in the woods. He instead meets Rick, who is attempting to retrieve the pistol he stashed in a blender, only to find it is missing. Rick and Carl team up to kill a group of walkers that rushes them, and one that may have been left as a trap. Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun), Tara Chambler (Alanna Masterson) and Noah (Tyler James Williams) join Nicholas and Deanna's son, Aiden (Daniel Bonjour), for a training run. Despite Aiden's cocky behavior, his inexperience and recklessness nearly gets Tara killed by a walker which they had tied up as a practice dummy in revenge for it killing half of the last group. Glenn and Tara disagree with Aiden's careless use of a walker; Aiden confronts Glenn about this when they get back, starting a shoving match, then taking a swing at Glenn in front of Rick and Deanna. Glenn ducks the punch and lands one on Aiden, while Nicholas tries to get involved, only to be taken to the ground by Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus). Rick pulls Daryl off to keep him from going too far, and Deanna instructs the town's residents to treat Rick's group as equals. Deanna sends everyone off to check in their weapons and offers Rick and Michonne (Danai Gurira) the jobs of town's Constables, which they accept. Deanna makes a point of thanking Glenn for knocking her son \\"on his ass.\\" Later that evening, alone with Carol and Daryl, Rick states that if the residents prove too weak to protect themselves, their group will have to take over the settlement. Production The episode marks the first appearances of many characters of the Alexandria Safe-Zone community. Katelyn Nacon as Enid, Alexandra Breckenridge and Corey Brill were cast as Jessie Anderson and her husband, Peter Anderson, a gifted surgeon. Major Dodson and Austin Abrams were cast as their sons Sam and Ron Anderson. (In the comics, Ron was a counterpart to a 9-year-old Carl; his role was split into two for the series: a young, timid Sam and a troubled teenaged Ron.) It also features Aiden Monroe, Deanna's son, a character exclusive to the television series portrayed by Daniel Bonjour. The episode also featured the introduction of Alexandria Safe-Zone leader and former congresswoman from Ohio, Deanna Monroe. The character itself is a remixed version and gender-swap of Douglas Monroe from Robert Kirkman's original source material. Tovah Feldshuh was cast as Deanna Monroe in 2014. Feldshuh explained that her portrayal of Deanna was inspired by Hillary Clinton. She said: \\"I based her on Hillary Clinton. She's somebody I've admired and somebody incredibly qualified to lead the nation. She's been in service to the United States for a good deal of her life. I studied her as my immediate prototype. I looked at other wonderful congresswomen, and tried to think what I could bring to it: Where did the character connect with my character as a human being? Because there was no time. Don't forget, this wasn't my audition (character). It's not like subliminally I had prepared.\\" On her auditioning process, she described it as \\"extremely tense\\" but also \\"wonderful\\". She considered Alexandria an \\"incredible naivete\\" citing that nothing has happened to the community since the outbreak. On bringing Rick Grimes and the survivors into the community, she said: \\"Deanna is clearly looking to connect with street smarts, brawn, muscle, but not hooliganism. She has to make sure these people are rational.\\" She further commented that Deanna is a culturist who \\"needs [Rick's] brawn [just as much as] he needs her cultural brain.\\" She further assessed the community and her character saying: \\"Alexandria is named after the greatest city with the greatest library in the world‚Äîit was the first great library in Alexander‚Äôs empire. And Deanna is a woman of the book. She‚Äôs a woman of high intellect and a woman who is highly cultured. She‚Äôs a woman who knows how to get a grandma to babysit little children in her 30-member society. But as a great leader, she knows they need new blood. They need new blood to procreate. They need new genetic pools to get some strong blood in there. And she‚Äôs desperate for brawn, for warriors that they can trust.\\" Scott Ian of the American thrash metal band Anthrax makes an appearance in this episode as a walker. Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 14.43 million American viewers with an 18-49 rating of 7.5, an increase in viewership from the previous episode which had 13.44 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 6.9. The UK broadcast was the most-watched on the network that week, with 1.22 million viewers. In Australia, the episode was watched by 86,000 viewers, making it the most-watched telecast on pay television that day. In New Zealand, it received 134,620 viewers, as well as 27,190 timeshifted viewers. =Critical reception= Many critics praised the scenes involving Melissa McBride as Carol in the episode. The episode was critically acclaimed, with many praising aspects such as the introduction of the Alexandria setting, its shift in narrative, the theme of civilization, and the character development of Carol Peletier and Rick Grimes. Writing for The Independent, Alex Straker praised Andrew Lincoln and Melissa McBride's performances, as well as noting that the episode would be referred to as \\"the turning point of the season\\" in retrospect. Rebecca Hawkes of The Daily Telegraph summed up the episode as \\"gripping\\" and deemed Alexandria \\"brilliantly realised.\\" She also noted that Carol's interview was one of the most interesting scenes of the episode, inferring of her transformation from \\"victim to killer, heroine, and tough-as-nails fighter, described herself as a former housewife, happiest when cooking and homemaking.\\" Zack Handlen for The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, complimenting the writing team for its improvement on structure over the course of the series, and called the episode one of his favorites of the season. He praised the scene involving Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride)'s interview and the character of Carl Grimes and his struggle settling back into a normal lifestyle. He also adulated the prospect of a new status quo, saying: \\"Another reason that ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù works is that it‚Äôs the first time in a while that the show has suggested the possibility of a new status quo, one that could significantly affect how things work from now on.\\" He further assessed that \\"What comes across most clearly in ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù is the uber-competence of the central ensemble, their skills as survivors, their hesitance to accept the possibility of peace, and their ruthlessness once they realize they might have found a new home.\\" He further complimented the setting as opposed to previous safe havens the characters had stayed in temporarily saying: \\"Alexandria could be a home base that offers more chance for loss and moral complexity than previous settings. Rick keeps saying that life is about survival, but here‚Äôs a chance to make it about more than that, and it could be interesting to see how Rick deals with that possibility.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com praised the introduction of Alexandria and felt it was a vast improvement of depicting civilization in comparison to Woodbury, a community introduced in the third season. Surette found Carol's reaction to be the standout and most interesting. Surette said: \\"Carol's reaction was the most interesting one, as she seemingly went all-in on participating in the Junior League, downplaying the kind of badass she became in the woods, and fondly remembering her abusive husband (yeah right) to Alexandria leader Deanna, while also warning Rick in private that the longer the group stayed in Alexandria, the weaker they would become. I love you, Carol, and I love your huge-ass guns.\\" He also noted: \\"Carol surrendering her guns was hilarious. She continues to be the absolute best.\\" The theme of civilization itself was praised as well. Mark Perigald of The Boston Herald and Amanda Michelle Steiner for People found Carol to be humorous in her lies in the episode. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10 saying that the episode had \\"some really satisfying moments featuring the dirty, exhausted survivors experiencing a bit of 'culture shock'.\\" References External links *\\"Remember\\" at AMC * * Category:2015 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 5) episodes ","title":"Remember (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"45269772","text":"Pinkneyville is an unincorporated community located within Andover Township in Sussex County, New Jersey, United States.Locality Search, State of New Jersey.

This political crisis mainly involved in the dispute between Abdul Rahman Ya'kub (former Sarawak chief minister) and his nephew Abdul Taib Mahmud (chief minister of Sarawak) over the control of the state government and Sarawak's natural resources. 1983 Abdul Rahman Ya'kub was the third Sarawak chief minister, ruling from 1970 to 1981. He left his chief minister post to his nephew Abdul Taib Mahmud in 1981. Abdul Rahman then proceed to assume the ceremonial post of Governor of Sarawak from 1981 to 1985. Abdul Rahman had advocated his nephew for the chief minister post but the relationship soon turned sour after two years. This was because Abdul Rahman wanted Taib to take his advice while running the state government. Rahman's loyalists in Sarawak cabinet also tried to direct the distribution of the state's natural resources and the operation of governmental agencies according to Rahman's wishes. Taib continued Rahman's governing policy and inherited the whole Sarawak cabinet intact from his uncle. However, Taib soon grew frustrated with his uncle's control. Taib slowly replaced Rahman's loyalists with his own men. This has resulted in Rahman's displeasure over Taib.Syam, M.F (2012). In Domination and Contestation: Muslim Bumiputera Politics in Sarawak. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. p. 124-141, 148, 153-159. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 1 February 2015. During the opening ceremony of Tanjung Kidurong port of Bintulu in September 1983, Rahman criticised the federal government for breaking its promise of building a new airport in Bintulu while Taib was trying to deliver his own speech. Taib felt embarrassed by the action of his uncle and left the stage while his uncle was still speaking. Taib later made a public apology on the incident and handed over his resignation letter to Abdul Rahman. Rahman declined the resignation of Taib because Rahman himself also handed over a resignation letter to Yang di-Pertuan Agong to vacate his governor's seat. However, Rahman was persuaded by Yang di-Pertuan Agong to stay until his term expires in April 1985. =1983 PBB general assembly= In September 1983, triennial general assembly of Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) was held. Taib Mahmud, who was the president of the PBB party, tried to secure his own position by not allowing the president and one of the two deputy presidents posts being contested. He allowed one deputy president seat (Bumiputera wing) to be contested but later regretted because Taib worried that Rahman's men would be winning the deputy president seat, thus challenging Taib's authority in the party. Taib stopped the party elections except for lower tiered Supreme Council seats of the Bumiputera wing. Subsequently, a motion was tabled in the general assembly to authorise Taib to appoint a suitable deputy president for the post. Rahman's faction objected the motion. Since then, Rahman's faction started to attack Taib Mahmud. Matu-Daro PBB branch, formerly headed by Abdul Rahman, tabled a motion to form Sarawak United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) by merging all the bumiputera parties including PBB to order to curb Taib's power in the party. However, federal UMNO leaders such as Musa Hitam said that Sarawak Barisan Nasional (BN) was still strong and thus there was no need of UMNO in Sarawak. However, unknown to Rahman supporters, Taib already made a secret agreement with prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad that UMNO will not enter Sarawak as long as Mahathir remains as Malaysian prime minister and Taib remains as chief minister of Sarawak. Salleh Jafaruddin (Rahman's nephew) used the General Assembly to mention that Rahman's speech during the opening of Bintulu port was actually not offensive to Taib and Taib should not respond negatively to the matter. However, he also praised Taib for making an apology to Abdul Rahman and reminded Taib he should respect the elders such as Abdul Rahman. 1984-1985 =Involvement of PBDS and the federal government= Rahman and his supporters also tried to garner the support of non-Muslim bumiputera community especially the Dayaks by feeding them with issues of Taib's policy in marginalising the Dayak community. These issues has led to the support of Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak (PBDS) towards Abdul Rahman. Besides, Taib Mahmud also grew uncomfortable with Leo Moggie (president of PBDS and Federal Minister of Energy, Post, and Telecomunnication) intimate relationship with the then Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. Therefore, Taib Mahmud hinted Daniel Tajem (deputy president of PBDS) to take over the president post from Leo Moggie but it fell on deaf ears. Rahman's supporters also tried to create a crack in relationship between Taib and the federal government by criticising the federal leaders for ignoring Sarawak needs: In response to these criticisms, the federal government announced several new projects such as the establishment of RM 400 million Universiti Pertanian Malaysia (UPM) campus in Bintulu. Taib defended the federal leaders by arguing that the prime minister has a strong sense of national integration so the federal government would not marginalise Sarawak. Taib also asked for people's patience in waiting for development projects in Sarawak. =Personal attacks against Taib Mahmud= In early 1985, Abdul Rahman wrote a personal letter to Taib Mahmud which was later copied to Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. Rahman ended the letter with: However, Mahathir refused to interfere with the matter. After Rahman stepped down from his Governor post, he was not happy with Taib's choice of new Governor Ahmad Zaidi Adruce because Ahmad Zaidi was believed to have a connection with Indonesian rebels during Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. Rahman started to question Taib's faith in Islam by accusing Taib of practising Bomohism (a traditional Malay belief in spirits and black magic) in great detail: In response to Rahman's accusation, Taib argued that nobody has the right to question his faith because only God could judge him. =Taib Mahmud's response= In response to criticisms of Abdul Rahman and his supporters, Taib Mahmud, as the president of PBB, removed Salleh Jafaruddin from his PBB's deputy secretary-general post. A Taib loyalist, Wan Madzihi Wan Madzhar, became the new deputy secretary-general. In November 1985, Taib also suspended Wan Habib Syed Mahmud from PBB's vice- president post, Haji Bala Munir from publicity chief, and Haji A.S. Jaya from assistant-publicity chief. Adenan Satem, a Taib loyalist, became the new publicity chief. Taib also started to reshuffle his cabinet in 1985 by creating three new ministries and abolishing two others. Taib placed the newly created Ministry of Resource Planning under him so that he could control the distribution of timber concessions. Taib retained the portfolio firmly under him until his retirement in 2014. Such power of distributing timber concessions was previously held under a Rahman loyalist named Noor Tahir. Noor Tahir was later given a less important portfolio which was Ministry of Environment and Tourism. Hafsah Harun, another Rahman loyalist, was given the portfolio of Minister of Social Development. 1986 =Rahman supporters' response= In April 1986, Salleh Jafaruddin resigned from his state assembly seat of Oya and ceased to become a member of the PBB party because he could not tolerate the leadership of Taib Mahmud any more. This was because organisers blocked him from attending special assembly of PBB Oya branch although he was the branch chairman. Saadi Olia (Kuala Rajang) and Wan Habib Syed Mahmud (Balingian) soon follow suit and resigned from the party but they kept their own state assembly seats. Wan Habib and Saadi Olia later set up a new party named United Sarawak Natives Association (USNA) in 1986. Wan Habib became the president of the party while Salleh became the secretary-general. Salleh Jafaruddin resignation from the state assembly seat of Oya had resulted in a by-election held on 1 and 2 July 1986. Salleh had to contest for the seat as an independent because his party cannot be registered on time. He contested against Wan Madzihi Wan Mahdzar who was the deputy secretary-general of the PBB party. Salleh subsequently lost the seat to Wan Madzihi. =1986 parliamentary election= During the August 1986 Malaysian general election, all the Sarawak Barisan Nasional component parties were able to win all the seats contested except for SUPP. SUPP lost 2 seats (Serian and Rajang) to independents and 1 seat (Bandar Kuching) to Democratic Action Party (DAP). Sarawak National Party (SNAP) lost 4 seats to PBDS. Both SNAP and PBDS were component parties of Barisan Nasional at that time. There was only a marginal decline for the number of popular votes garnered by Sarawak BN. During the election, Simunjan and Mukah were considered hotly contested seats. Wan Habib (USNA) contested for the Simunjan seat but lost to Bujang Ulis (PBB). Salleh Jafaruddin (USNA) contested for Mukah but lost to Leo Michael Toyad (PBB). Meanwhile, Taib Mahmud won a landslide victory against an independent in Kota Samarahan. Overall, the total number of popular vote garnered by PBB in Muslim bumiputera seats decreased from 77.56% in 1982 election to 68.15% in 1986 election. =1986 PBB general assembly= PBB general assembly was held in September 1986 soon after the parliamentary election. Taib decided that top posts would not be contested to prevent a further split in the party. However, the deputy president post was still vacant since the last party election. By this time, most of the Rahman supporters were out of the party. Taib decided to open the deputy president post for contest. Sulaiman Daud and Abang Abu Bakar contested for the seat. However, Taib openly endorsed Abu Bakar for the seat. As a result of Taib endorsement, Abang Abu Bakar won the contest, polling 370 votes against the 131 votes by Sulaiman Daud. Besides, 7 vice- president posts and 15 supreme council members were also opened for contests. Abang Johari Tun Openg received the highest number of votes, followed by Wan Wadzihi Wan Madzhar and Bujang Ulis. Adenan Satem was the only candidate who lost the race to vice-president post. Adenan was later appointed to publicity chief while his brother Zainuddin Satem was appointed to the treasurer post. Leo Michael Toyad also secured a seat in the Supreme Council. 1987 political crisis On 9 March 1987 (Monday), four Sarawak ministers and 3 assistant ministers suddenly resigned from the Sarawak cabinet. The four ministers were Noor Tahir (PBB), Hafsah Harun (PBB), Daniel Tajem (PBDS), and Edward Jeli (SNAP) and the three assistant ministers were Gramong Juna (PBDS), Michael Ben (SNAP), and Hollis Tini (SUPP). Edward Jeli's resented Taib for not getting timber concessions, which could service his RM 5 million loans of developing shophouses in Miri. Noor Tahir's was unhappy because Taib was favouring a group of selected crony capitalists especially Foochow Chinese who monopolies contracts given by the state government. Daniel Tajem was the last key player who agreed on a coup on Taib. Tajem was officiating a farmer's organisation function at Mukah on Friday before he went back to Kuching on Saturday. He was then called by Leo Moggie (PBDS president) to meet Abdul Rahman at his home in Kuala Lumpur. During the meeting on Sunday evening, Tajem had an argument with Abdul Rahman on whether to table a formal motion of no confidence in state assembly or just hand over a letter containing state assemblymen signatures to the Governor of Sarawak. After the meeting, Tajem was given an envelope containing RM 300 for his party expenses and he resided at Shangri-La Hotel in Kuala Lumpur at the end of the day. On the Monday morning when Sarawak Tribune (owned by Abdul Rahman) made public the resignation of 7 Sarawak ministers, Tajem decided to check out from Shangri-La Hotel and check in into Ming Court Hotel, where the defectors gathered. The 7 leaders with another 20 state assemblymen were flown to Ming Court Hotel (present day Corus Hotels) at Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur accompanied by Abdul Rahman and the president of PBDS, Leo Moggie. Leo Moggie called for a party meeting at his residence in Kuala Lumpur to canvass support for the removal of Taib Mahmud. Leo Moggie stated that his party has to support Abdul Rahman or otherwise he himself will quit from the president post. Daniel Tajem supported Leo Moggie's cause. Finally, the PBDS Supreme Council went in favour of Leo Moggie. The PBDS party has withdrawn from the Sarawak Barisan National (BN) coalition at state government level but remained with the coalition at the federal government level. They announced that they lost confidence in Taib Mahmud because \\"he could no longer administer the government properly and has failed to look after the interests of Bumiputera in Sarawak.\\" The 27 state assemblymen named their group Kumpulan Maju (Progressive group). They demanded Taib to resign or otherwise Taib would face a no confidence vote in the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly. The Maju group decided to take this course of action because they fear that in an upcoming Sarawak cabinet reshuffle, Daniel Tajem would be sacked as deputy chief minister. Therefore, they have not enough time to wait and table a formal motion of no confidence against Taib in the state assembly. Tajem had criticised Taib for marginalising Dayaks before this at a PBDS Triennial General Assembly in Sibu. Besides, the rise of Dayak nationalism at that time was also ripe to topple Taib Mahmud. The Maju group also tried to lobby the prime minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad into supporting the group but Mahathir was preoccupied with the hotly contested United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party election which would later worsened into 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis. Mahathir would not want to direct support to Rahman's or Taib's group because he would not want to be blamed if another non-Muslim bumiputera chief minister in Sarawak was installed after Stephen Kalong Ningkan and Tawi Sli. Daniel Tajem had a 15 minutes meeting with Mahathir to lobby the prime minister support but Mahathir advised Daniel Tajem to keep the political crisis in Sarawak but not to the federal government level. Mahathir also stated that Maju group would be free to do what it takes to oust Taib as long as it is within the law. However, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP) and Sarawak National Party (SNAP) directed their support towards Taib. SUPP also started to persuade the federal government to support Taib in the crisis. This was because SUPP would not want Abdul Rahman to be back in power again because Rahman was responsible for the weakening of SUPP in 1978 by allowing Democratic Action Party (DAP) to enter Sarawak and also the policy of Islamisation adopted by Rahman during his tenure in office as chief minister. Meanwhile, for SNAP, James Wong was not in favour for Abdul Rahman because he was detained at Kamunting Detention Centre for 18 months under Internal Security Act when he was the opposition leader against Barisan Nasional in 1974 parliamentary elections. Abdul Rahman was believed to have advocated his arrest by accusing him of seceding the Limbang territory to Brunei. Taib also threatened to cancel SNAP's logging concessions if James Wong were to switched to Rahman's side. However, Taib Mahmud had a cabinet meeting in the morning of 10 March 1987 and decided to call for a fresh election. At 11:45 am, Taib accompanied by two deputy chief ministers, Tan Sri Datuk Amar Sim Kheng Hong and Alfred Jabu anak Numpang met the Governor at the latter's office inside the state legislative assembly complex. The request to dissolve the state assembly was granted. Meanwhile, Abdul Rahman only sent Noor Tahir back to Kuching on the next day to hand over the petition to Sarawak Governor at The Astana. However, the Governor was already in Kuala Lumpur. Taib Mahmud decided to reject all the demands by Maju group. The Maju group was surprised on course of action taken by Taib because they were confident that Taib would step down. Taib appointed new ministers and assistant ministers to replace those who had defected to Maju group. Adenan Satem was appointed as Minister of Land Development while Abang Johari was appointed as Minister of Agriculture and Community Development. James Wong was also given a portfolio of Minister of Environment and Tourism to acknowledge the latter's support towards Taib. 1987 state elections Just before the 1987 elections, Abdul Rahman registered a new party named Sarawak Malaysian People's Association (PERMAS). It accepted the former PBB members and other members who have defected from Sarawak Barisan Nasional (BN). PERMAS and PBDS contested a total of 42 out of 48 state assembly seats with each one contesting in 21 seats. Maju group presented a manifesto named \\"A Government for the People\\" which contains four major points: calling an end to the present Sarawak government, uphold the rule of law and protect Sarawak rights, restore democracy, and to ensure the ministerial power will be exercised according to the law. The Maju group nominated Noor Tahir as the new Sarawak chief minister if the group ever come to power in state elections. However, Abdul Rahman was widely believed to be the next chief minister if the Maju group succeeded in forming a new government. During the election, PERMAS attacked Taib leadership styles and his practice in money politics. Meanwhile, PBDS used Dayak nationalism to woo the votes. Abdul Rahman also revealed a list of timber companies associated to Taib on local newspapers owned by Rahman supporters.Ross. M.L (2001). In Timber booms and institutional breakdown in Southeast Asia. Cambridge University Press. p. 148-149. . Google Book Search. Retrieved on 1 December 2009. Rahman also ran a nine-series story named \\"Abdul Taib:The Inside Story\\" and exposed Taib disrespectful attitude towards him. Taib-led Sarawak BN decided to contest all the seats in the state election. They also released a manifesto named \\"Continued Stability through Politics of Development\\". This manifesto promised a government which continues to strive for stability and development in the state, peace and harmony among the people, and to uphold the freedom of worship and cultural practices. In the election, Sarawak BN mainly campaigned on developmental promises for the voters. They also described Abdul Rahman as \\"power-crazy, anti-Chinese, and practiced timber politics\\". Sarawak BN also revealed a list of timber concessions that was awarded to Rahman and his supporters during Rahman's reign as chief minister.Politics, Law and the Logging Industry URL assessed on 1 December 2009 Sarawak BN dished out at least 48 project valued at RM 190.22 million. Most of the projects promise by Sarawak BN was considered minor projects such as building of community halls, bus shades, and village roads. A total of RM 4.21 million worth of financial grants was given to 14 social organisations in Sarawak. Unable to compete with BN style of \\"Politics of Development\\", the Maju group was defeated in the election. Taib continued to embrace this strategy throughout his tenure as chief minister after he witnessed the defeat of Maju group during this election. After the election, Sarawak BN won 28 out of 48 seats in the state assembly. However, Sarawak BN's popularity has declined from 59.17% in 1983 to 55.24% in the current election. Taib Mahmud has won comfortably against Wan Yusof (PERMAS) at Sebandi seat. SNAP was the biggest casualty in the election. It won only 2 out of 11 seats contested. James Wong (SNAP) retained his Limbang seat by a majority of 454 votes. Meanwhile, Maju group won 20 seats (15 seats by PBDS and 5 seats by PERMAS). Abdul Rahman (PERMAS) was easily defeated by Wahab Dolah (PBB) at Matu-Daro seat with a majority of 1,625 votes. Daniel Tajem was defeated at Lingga seat by a narrow majority of 59 votes. During this election, Malaysian federal government has not interfered with the contest between Taib and Rahman and allowed the crisis to be settled through ballot box. Declining opposition (1987-1991) After the election, Taib scrapped the deputy chief minister post which had been allocated to PBDS. He also started to terminate the services of community chiefs who were supportive of Abdul Rahman during the 1987 election and replace them with Taib loyalists. Taib also purged government officers who supported Rahman during the 1987 elections. Taib also amended the Forest Bill so that the power of granting and revoke license permits will lie solely on the Forestry Director and the Minister of Resource Planning. Amendment of the bill has tightened Taib's grip over distribution of timber licenses. Taib also introduced the Party Hopping Bill which forbids BN assemblymen from crossing over to opposition bench. Taib also used Internal Security Act (ISA) to jail critics of his regime. Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayub had accused the Maju group of plotting to assassinate Taib. The government had launched Operation API which detained 11 people under ISA. PERMAS members were among those who were detained under the act. Such accusation has tarnished the image of the opposition led by PERMAS and PBDS. Taib Mahmud also lured nine opposition state assemblymen (eight from PBDS and one from PERMAS) into BN's fold by promising material rewards and political appointments, thus securing BN's two-thirds majority in forming a strong government. PERMAS continued its struggle by wresting control of the oldest Muslim-Bumiputera organisation in Sarawak, Malay National Union (MNU) which was formed on 10 October 1939. However, MNU became dormant since the formation of Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS) and Barisan Rakyat Jati Sarawak (BARJASA) parties in 1962. Although PERMAS was able to dominate MNU eventually, it did not pose any significant threat to Taib Mahmud. PERMAS and PBDS tried to challenge Taib again during 1990 parliamentary elections and 1991 state elections although PERMAS-PBDS alliance was dissolved after 1987 elections. In 1990 parliamentary elections, Sarawak BN won 17 out of 23 parliamentary seats. PBDS remained in BN fold in the parliamentary elections but opposed BN during state elections. On the other hand, PERMAS failed to make any significant impact during the parliamentary elections. With the waning influence of PERMAS, a new opposition party named Parti Warisan Pribumi Sarawak (WARISAN) was branched out from PERMAS in January 1991. This new party also planned to bring the national party, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), in to Sarawak. However, Taib dismissed the attempt by WARISAN by stating that \\"this type of national politics is not well understood in Sarawak\\". Mahathir also stated there is no reason for UMNO to enter Sarawak. WARISAN subsequently failed to register as an official political party and issue of UMNO in Sarawak gradually subsided. In fact, there were a number of Sarawak Malays who had joined as UMNO members in Peninsular Malaysia. Several UMNO leaders in Sarawak claimed that there were 38,000 UMNO members in Sarawak in 1988. PBDS also tried to co-operate another Dayak party named Parti Negara Rakyat Sarawak (NEGARA) and devised \\"Sarawak Chief Minister Project 1992\\" which aimed to install a new Dayak chief minister if the group win the mandate of the voters to form a government in 1991 state elections. PBDS was optimistic in winning 22 state assembly seats during 1991 elections but it won only 7 seats. Meanwhile, PERMAS and NEGARA failed to win any seats during the state elections. On the other hand, Sarawak BN secured 49 out of 56 state assembly seats after the election. Aftermath Realising that PERMAS and PBDS no longer mounted a powerful challenge against Taib, Abdul Rahman decided to dissolve PERMAS in 1991. In 1992, PBDS decided to rejoin Sarawak BN and was readmitted into the coalition on 1 June 1994. With the inclusion of PBDS into Sarawak BN, opposition forces in Sarawak were virtually eliminated. Sarawak BN was able to dominate subsequent elections in 1995 (parliamentary) and 1996 (state) with landslide victories. Abdul Rahman celebrated his 80th birthday in Hilton Hotel, Kuching in 2008. During the ceremony, he hugged his nephew, Pehin Sri Abdul Taib Mahmud, marking the end of the 20-year-old strained relationship between an uncle and a nephew after the Ming Court Affair. He said that he stitched up his relationship with Taib because \\"blood is thicker than water\\". Keruntum Sdn Bhd, a timber company that was linked to Rahman, filed a suit against Taib, Sarawak Forest Department, and the state government in 1987 for revoking 25-year timber license of the company. Keruntum's case was upheld by the High Court of Sarawak and the Malaysian federal court in 1988. However, the company's license was revoked for the second time in the same year. The company then filed another suit against Taib in 1990 and finally, on 15 March 2017, 27 years after the suit was filed, the Malaysian federal court dismissed the company's appeal as it has not justified the case adequately that Taib was \\"politically motivated\\" when cancelling the company's timber license.

She taught English in schools and colleges in Colorado. Her poetry and short stories were published in The New Yorker and other leading magazines. Early life and education Deatt Hudson was born June 20, 1931 at Presbyterian Hospital in Denver, Colorado to Margaret McEwan Hudson and George Fletcher Hudson. The family moved to Georgetown and Longmont before settling in Dolores, Colorado. In an autobiography she wrote as a school assignment, she said that although the bars in town outnumbered the stores 2 to 1, she found the people \\"good- hearted and friendly\\". Even at this early age, she wanted to write poetry and short stories, although she admitted that teaching would probably be a better choice if she wanted to eat. Her parents had high expectations for their daughter, and yet allowed her to make her own decisions. She believed that this helped her become self-reliant and taught her to form her own opinions. Deatt Hudson received her first literary award during her junior year of high school, when she won first place in a Western State College scholarship contest in American literature. Hudson attended Dolores High School and graduated valedictorian in 1948. She was awarded a scholarship to any of the state schools, but opted to earn her B.A. at the University of Denver where she was elected Phi Beta Kappa. She also participated in Ballroom Partners, a dance group. She received an M.A. in American Studies from Yale University in 1954 and another in English from the Breadloaf School of English at Middlebury College in 1967. Teaching career Upon receiving her first M.A., Hudson began teaching at North High School in Denver. After some time at North High School, she began teaching English at Colorado Women's College. After retiring from her position, she continued to teach at Emily Griffith Opportunity School where she taught English as a Second Language. Those who knew her all agreed that she was an outstanding teacher, who believed that teaching was the noblest profession. Writing career Throughout her life, Hudson wrote poetry and short stories, which were published in The New Yorker, The Nation, Prism International and other periodicals. Personal life She loved to travel, and a year-long trip to Peru in 1962-1963 had a great deal of influence on both her writing and teaching styles. Deatt Hudson never married and was an only child, so at the time of her death her friends and her students were her family. Towards the end of her life, Deatt Hudson suffered greatly from asthma, which significantly curtailed her activities. She died of respiratory arrest November 19, 1988 at the age of 57.

The mines are best known for producing silver, but they were also a source of copper and lead. A number of remnants of these mines (shafts, galleries, surface workshops) are still present in the region. The mines were exploited in prehistoric times as a source of copper and galena, a lead ore. In the classical period, mining in the area resumed. The Athenians used large numbers of slaves to mine the area, with the silver produced contributing significantly to the city's wealth. Abandoned in the 1st century BC, the mines were reactivated in 1864 and mined for their lead by French and Greek companies until 1978. Map of Southern Attica, showing the locations of the mines at Laurion. Washing table at the mines of Laurion History = Ancient times = Referring to the mines in his 354 BC work Ways and Means, Xenophon wrote: > It is clear, I presume, to every one that these mines have for a very long > time been in active operation; at any rate no one will venture to fix the > date at which they first began to be worked. In fact, the exploitation of the mines stretches from the Bronze Age: isotopic analyses of lead present in objects of this era indicate that they were made in large part from metal extracted from the Laurion mines. The earliest evidence for mining activity at Laurion comes from the Late Neolithic period, around 3,200 BC. Mining became more systematic starting from the late sixth- century BC, and in the fifth century it was an important source of revenue for Athens. During this period, the city began to mine a new and particularly rich vein, which unlike the two which had previously been exploited did not appear on the surface. During the tyranny of Peisistratos systematic exploitation of the mineral resources of Athens began. Shafts were driven down into the ground and galleries opened where slaves, chained, naked, and branded, worked the seams illuminated only by guttering oil lamps. An unrecorded number were children. It was a miserable, dangerous, and brief life. This discovery meant that at the beginning of the second Persian invasion of Greece, the Athenian state had at its disposal 100 talents/3 tonnes of silver. Rather than distribute this wealth amongst the citizens of Athens, Themistocles proposed that this money should be used to construct 200 triremes, which were used to conduct the naval campaign against Persia which culminated in victory at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC. Loss of free men and slaves as a result of the Peloponnesian War (431‚Äì404 BC) caused the mines to shut down. This compounded the economic crisis of Athens, along with the infrastructure damage to the port city of Piraeus. = Modern times = Mining at Laurion resumed in 1864. Renewed mining involved both the processing of ancient slag for remaining lead and silver and the extraction of fresh ore. Mining of zinc ore was a commercially significant in the Laurion area in modern times. It was mined from reactivation in 1864 until 1930. Iron ore was also mined through the 1950s. The mines continued to be active, producing silver and other metals until profitable sulfide deposits were exhausted in 1978.  Geology  The mines of Laurion are situated in the Attic-Cycladic metamorphic complex. Structurally, the Laurion area bedrock consists of a recumbent fold in the Kamariza marble with the Kamariza schist forming a hinge. Atop the folded marbles lie a layer of limestone deposited during a marine transgressive episode in the Jurassic and lower Cretaceous. This limestone layer is topped by Jurassic blueschists and overthrust, metamorphosed ophiolite. Diagram showing Laurion area strata with contacts I, II, and III labeled Miners in the 19th century organized the major deposits in this sequence into three separate contacts. The first contact is located within the transgressive limestones and consists of lead, zinc and silver sulfide minerals. The second contact occurs between the upper Kamariza marble and the Kamariza schist. This deposit consists of cerussite (lead carbonate) and smithsonite (zinc carbonate) ores. The third contact occurs between the lower Kamariza marble and Kamariza schist. This deposit contains cerussite and iron oxides.

He led the talks for the MNLA with ECOWAS leaders and Burkinab√© President Blaise Compaor√© in Burkina Faso in June 2012. At the meeting he declared that the MNLA was willing to negotiate with the Malian government with the ECOWAS mediators. He had a Malian government arrest warrant until October 2013, when it was lifted due to his work in the reconciliation process of the country. On 18 March 2014 the Coalition for the People of Azawad (CPA) was declared with Assaleh as its chairperson. It was declared in the name of political and MNLA cadres and it claimed a council with 32 members was established.

At the creation of the CPA it apparently had Algerian support. Assaleh claimed the independence of Azawad was not a goal for him and the party. At the time of his departure he argued that 70% of the militants were following him.

Gotsman has published over 150 research papers Gotsman is a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors and a Fellow of the Academy of Europe (Academia Europaea). =Cornell Tech= Gotsman played a leading role in the formation of the Cornell Tech campus in New York City. Cornell Tech is an applied sciences campus dedicated to fostering innovation and producing entrepreneurial engineers, a project conceived and driven by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the New York City Economic Development Corporation, with the purpose of growing the tech sector of NYC. In 2011, Gotsman helped develop the proposal to establish an Applied Sciences campus, submitted by Cornell University and Technion to the City of New York. The proposal subsequently won the bid, competing against a number of groups of international universities, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University. Technion was cited as \\"the MIT of Israel\\" and a key player because of its innovation culture and contribution to the emergence of Israel as a global technological superpower, as documented in the book \\"Startup Nation\\".Senor, Dan, and Saul Singer. Start-up nation: The story of Israel's economic miracle. Random House LLC, 2011. In 2011, Gotsman was appointed Deputy Senior Vice-President (equivalent to Vice Provost) at Technion, responsible for the joint Technion-Cornell venture. In Feb 2012 he was appointed Founding Director of the joint Jacobs Technion-Cornell Innovation Institute at Cornell Tech. In this role, Gotsman developed a number of novel academic and entrepreneurial programs, including the successful Runway program, supporting PhDs forming commercial ventures based on their deep technical expertise. He also engaged in faculty and student recruiting, corporate relations, media relations and fund raising. In April 2013, he helped raise a $133M naming gift from Joan and Irwin M. Jacobs of San Diego. =New Jersey Institute of Technology= In 2017, Gotsman was named Distinguished Professor and Dean of the Ying Wu College of Computing at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT).. As such, he is chief executive of one of the few dedicated Colleges of Computing in the US. The Ying Wu College of Computing (YWCC) enrolls 3,200 of NJIT's 12,000 students, graduating 900 computing professionals at all levels every year, making it the largest generator of computing talent in the New York metro area. At NJIT, Gotsman was instrumental in expanding the College with a research Institute for Data Science and a new graduate-level instructional facility in Jersey City. Entrepreneurship Gotsman co-founded three startup companies: Virtue3D was founded in 1997 and developed advanced technologies for Web-based 3D computer graphics based on Technion intellectual property. The principal investors were Zohar and Yehuda Zisapel and Eurofund. The technology was eventually acquired by German Mental Images, itself later acquired by NVIDIA. Estimotion ‚Äì a precursor to Waze ‚Äì was founded in 2000 and developed technologies for real- time traffic-based applications for cellular phones. The principal investors were Partner/Orange Communications and Shlomo Group. Estimotion was acquired by British ITIS Holdings, itself later acquired by INRIX. CatchEye ‚Äì commercializing 3D camera-related video-processing technology that Gotsman developed with colleagues at ETH Zurich ‚Äì was founded in 2014 and acquired in 2017. Gotsman also co-founded in 2006 an active consulting company ‚Äì Geometrika ‚Äì which develops graphics and geometric software technologies.

Saint-Pierre had been founded by Pippin I of Aquitaine. Sicarius' remains are stored in a small glass-and-bronze reliquary mounted on the church wall. =Authenticity= According to Wasyliw, the bones may simply be those of a child who had been named after a bishop of Laon. In the 19th century, Sabine Baring-Gould was skeptical and wrote that \\"how the infant of a Hebrew mother acquired a Latin name has not been attempted to be explained\\".Sabine Baring- Gould, Castles and Cave Dwellings of Europe, ReadHowYouWant.com, 2008, pp. 287‚Äì8. This sentiment was echoed in 2014 by Kristan Lawson and Anneli Rufus: > The massacre happened a long time ago when Jesus, still a baby himself, > hadn't yet developed the following that would turn into Christianity. (Thus, > you might wonder, how did anyone have the foresight to scoop up this dead > baby? Ask not, friend.) The inscription of the tomb, dedicated to an \\"innocent\\" child, may have caused the confusion and the subsequent veneration as a Holy Innocent. Sicarius represents an \\"impulse to personify the supposedly ancient relic with names may imply a heightened sympathy for the sufferings of the infants, and perhaps for their grieving families as well\\". Sicarius' name is odd; it means \\"cut- throat\\" or \\"assassin\\". St. Memorius (M√©moire) was another child martyr and purported Holy Innocent whose relics were translated during the reign of Charlemagne; they were taken to the Cathedral of St. Front in P√©rigueux from St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.

Red and Liz meet with a group of factory inmates to plan their efforts to foil Braxton's scheme. One man advises that they go to the boiler room and cause an explosion that will destroy the Factory's server. Braxton calls Reddington over the phone and the two have a brief confrontational talk. Braxton intends to get the code needed to access the Factory's servers, which Goodson is determined to prevent. The FBI attempts to negotiate with Braxton, who responds by executing the warden (John Ventimiglia) and threatening to have Samar hanged. Cooper reluctantly gives the code to Braxton, whose men then go to the servers and gain access to the secret intelligence system. Liz crawls through narrow ventilation tunnels to get to the boiler room and then lets Red in. There they work together to increase the pressure in the boilers until an explosion occurs, incapacitating Red and causing Braxton to lose the server connection. Liz unsuccessfully attempts to resuscitate Red, thinks him dead, and ends up getting captured and taken to Braxton. Elsewhere, the NCS director is urged by his coworkers to have Braxton and Red eliminated, and orders Goodson to order an air strike on the facility. Reddington's helpers 'wake him up', he obtains and brandishes a shotgun, making his way through the wild prison inmates until he arrives at Braxton's location, shoots his men down and subdues him. Braxton begins to see and explain that he knows about Red and Liz's history in the house fire, how Red \\"came for Liz\\" and that Liz is \\"the one\\". Red urges Liz to shoot Braxton, but the missile strike hits the prison first. Production Series creator Jon Bokenkamp‚Äîin an interview for The Hollywood Reporter‚Äîsaid that the two- part story arc resembles a \\"big heightened event movie in a very contained way.\\" When asked whether or not the episode will be fit for new viewers post- Super Bowl, Bokenkamp said: > It's certainly an episode designed for a new viewer to just dive right into. > In watching it, I think they will very easily get a sense of what the show > is, who Reddington is, what the show tastes and feels and smells like. It's > an easy show to sort of dive right into at this point, but also I think > we've designed some really fun revelations and some [surprising payoffs] for > people who are ardent fans. In regard to preparation for new viewers, executive producer John Eisendrath said in an interview for Entertainment Weekly: > Yes, we knew that it was going to be the Super Bowl. We felt as if, first of > all, we were going to get a lot of viewers who had never seen the show > before.

In casting Ron Perlman as Luther Braxton‚Äîthe episode's title character‚ÄîBokenkamp said \\"I've been a fan of Ron Perlman for a long time. He just brings this great presence to the show. I think he's going to be a memorable Blacklister.\\" Prior to the episode's release, James Spader expressed his hopes to Zap2it that the series would gain more viewers from the Super Bowl. Reception Upon airing, the episode ranked as NBC's biggest overall audience for a scripted series in more than 10 years, with 26.5 million viewers. The Canadian broadcast received 1.37 million viewers, making it the fourth-highest-rated broadcast of the night and the twenty-second of the week.

In 1999, Omes and Russell Faibisch, his then-business partner, co-founded the Ultra Music Festival, an outdoor electronic music festival held annually in Miami, Florida. Since its founding, Ultra Music Festival has grown into one of the country's and the world's largest electronic dance music festivals. An estimated 400,000 people attended Ultra Music Festival over the course of two weekends in 2013, the highest number of attendees to date. Early life and education Omes was born and raised in Argentina. He moved to Miami Beach, Florida, when he was 9 years old with his mother and brother, Carlos Omes. Alex Omes graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School. Career He began his career within Miami's club and electronic music scenes as a bouncer at the Cameo nightclub in Miami Beach during the 1990s. He then became a publisher of an electronic and dance music magazine called D'VOX, which focused on Miami's emerging electronic dance music industry during the 1990s. Omes acquired professional contacts within the city's music and DJ culture while working at D'VOX and the nightclubs. One of Omes's contacts within the music industry was Russell Faibisch, with whom he conceived the idea for a beachfront music festival that would become Ultra. The two met at an event. In a 2013 interview with Miami New Times, Faibisch recalled, \\"I was doing an event and had to place some ads...That's when I met Alex Omes, who had the vision. We started Ultra together.\\" Omes and Faibisch, who had similar interests in club music, soon became close friends and, later, business partners. Together, they brainstormed the idea for a beachfront music festival to be held alongside the annual Winter Music Conference (WMC). Thousands of attendees and electronic music fans had attended WMC annually since its creation in 1985. The two business partners saw potential for a dance music event during the same week as WMC. Faibisch and Omes organized the first Ultra Music Festival on March 13, 1999, in Collins Park in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood. Artists performing at the first Ultra's main stage included Paul van Dyk, DJ Baby Anne and Josh Wink. The 1999 Ultra festival proved popular, with 10,000 concertgoers in attendance, though Omes and Faibisch still saw a financial loss of between $10,000 and $20,000 on the project during its first year. Ultra Music Festival was held as a one-day event from 1999 until 2006. It was expanded into a two-day festival from 2007 to 2010, eventually reaching across two consecutive weekends in 2013. Ultra Music Festival reverted to a three-day concert in 2014. The event has featured some of the world's top electronic and dance DJs and artists, including Avicii, DJ Eddie G Miami, Deadmau5, Ti√´sto, Paul van Dyk, and Madonna. Omes was pushed out of Ultra on August 10, 2010 after Ultra Music Festival officials ended its decade-long association with the Winter Music Conference. Omes charged that he had been forced out of Ultra following a \\"secret shareholders' meeting\\" in a lawsuit filed in 2012. Alex Omes soon partnered with another Miami nightlife promoter, Emi Guerra. Together, Omes and Guerra co-founded Go Big Productions, an event company, to stage concerts and other major events in Miami. In 2011 and 2012, Go Big Productions held concerts featuring Swedish House Mafia on the same weekends as the Ultra Music Festival. Go Big also planned a new two-day, multistage concert, called the UR1 music festival, which was scheduled to be held in downtown Miami in 2012, coinciding with Art Basel. However, UR1, which would have featured Kanye West and Lou Reed as headliners, was cancelled due to lower than expected ticket sales. Lawsuit and death In August 2012, Omes filed a $33 million lawsuit against Faibisch and two other Ultra Music Festival executives, Charlie Faibisch and Adam Russakoff, alleging that they had conspired to oust him from \\"the now financially successful event\\" (Ultra) following a \\"secret shareholders' meeting. The lawsuit alleged that the three knew that Omes would never agree to break off an existing affiliation with the Winter Music Conference. A two-week trial for the lawsuit began on Tuesday, January 13, 2015, in Miami. However, Alex Omes never arrived for that day's court proceedings. Omes's brother, Carlos, and his attorney, Aaron Resnick, became concerned when Omes didn't show up for the opening arguments on Tuesday morning. They discovered Alex Omes dead at his home at the age of 43. Omes had died on Monday night, January 12, 2015, according to a report from the Miami- Dade County Medical Examiner. His cause of death was released by the medical examiner on March 9, 2016, saying that Omes had amphetamines, ketamine, cocaine and GHB in his system when he died and cocaine was found in his apartment. Omes was survived by his son, Joshua Omes, and former wife, Karie Omes. His funeral was held at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Miami Beach on January 23, 2015.

He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 2015 to 2017, representing the electorate of Cook. Career Hailing from Innisfail, Queensland, Gordon first entered politics as the Labor candidate in the federal seat of Leichhardt for the 2013 election, losing to Liberal National incumbent Warren Entsch. However, he increased his profile enough that he was able to successfully stand in the state seat of Cook, essentially the far northern portion of the federal seat. Gordon was elected as a Labor candidate at the 2015 election before becoming an independent two months later. He retired at the 2017 election. Gordon was one of the first indigenous members in a generation. Controversy In 2015, Gordon was sacked by the Labor Party following disclosures of a criminal record dating back to 1980. In 2015, tip offs to the media led to Gordon publicly disclosing a criminal history dating back to the 1980s that he had not disclosed to his colleagues including driving offences, break and entering offences, breach of bail and probation, and an apprehended violence order taken out by his mother. Gordon's former de facto partner accused him of domestic violence and routinely not filing tax returns to avoid child support payments to his five children. In response Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk expelled Gordon from the Labor Caucus, and asked the state party's organisational wing to have Gordon expelled from the party altogether. Although Palaszczuk was well aware that the loss of Cook could potentially have put her premiership in jeopardy, she said that given the circumstances, she had no other choice. In September 2015, Queensland Police dropped the domestic violence charges against Gordon, citing insufficient evidence to prosecute. On the same day, police charged a woman with extortion for allegedly attempting to blackmail Gordon by claiming he had sent her an explicit image by SMS. Gordon was charged with drink driving and unlicensed driving on 1 June 2016 while pulled over at a random traffic stop on the Kennedy Highway at Kuranda, on the Atherton Tableland west of Cairns. He was taken to the Kuranda police station and allegedly returned a blood-alcohol content reading of 0.094. On 1 July 2016 Gordon pled guilty to both charges in the Brisbane Magistrates Court. He was fined $750 and disqualified from driving for four months. Retirement Gordon retired from politics at the 2017 election, having confirmed that he would not recontest his seat on 31 October 2017 following the calling of the election.

He has been the Labor member for Gladstone in the Queensland Legislative Assembly since 2015. The seat had been held by retiring independent MP Liz Cunningham since 1995. Butcher had previously contested the seat in 2012, losing to Cunningham. However, Gladstone has been a Labor stronghold for over a century, and most calculations of \\"traditional\\" two-party matchups during her tenure‚ÄìLabor vs. National before 2009, Labor vs. LNP since 2009‚Äìshowed it as a safe Labor seat. As evidence of Labor's strength in the seat, Labor would have held it on a comfortably safe margin of 11 percent in a traditional two-party contest even in the face of Labor's near-meltdown that year. For this reason, Butcher's victory was not considered an upset; it had been widely expected for some time that the seat would revert to Labor once Cunningham retired. Further underlining Labor's strength in Gladstone, Butcher won enough primary votes to win the seat outright, and pushed the LNP into third place. Butcher consolidated his hold on Gladstone in 2017, helped by a redistribution that increased his majority from 11.9 percent to 13 percent (from 25.1 percent to 25.3 percent in a \\"traditional\\" two-party matchup with the LNP). He picked up a healthy two-candidate swing of 10.7 percent, this time over a One Nation candidate, and again pushing the LNP into third place. He now sits on a majority of 20.7 percent, making Gladstone the fourth-safest Labor seat in the state and the safest outside Brisbane. In May 2020 Butcher was appointed as the new Minister for Regional Development and Manufacturing.http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2020/5/10/premier- delivers-new-look-cabinet-for-queenslanders-for-covid19-recovery References Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Queensland Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Glenn Butcher (politician)"},{"id":"45270489","text":"Foula Airfield is an airfield located on the remote island of Foula, part of the Shetland Islands in the north of Scotland.

Foula is also served by a ferry service running three times a week but it is claimed that tourists prefer the short flight to the 135 minute ferry crossing.

The chroniclers do not record whether he was captured by the Barbary pirates and sold to Uthman Dey or if he voluntarily joined the galleys of the Tunisian Beylik. After converting to Islam, he took the name Murad (Turkish: Morat)In the Christian west, Usta Murad was known by various names: Usta Mourato, Osta Moratto, Osta Mouratto, Sta Mouratto, Stamurato, Osta Murat and Estamorat. All are variants of the original Arabic. and began to build a comfortable position in Tunis by becoming a corsair of the beylik. An act delivered by the French consulate on 1 November 1594 indicates in effect that the \\"patron\\" of a ship from Salerno had declared himself to owe Mourad 90 gold crowns. From 1600 he increasingly entered into the esteem of Uthman Dey, becoming a sort of personal secretary. In 1615, Yusuf Dey appointed him to the command of the galleys of Bizerte, a role he occupied until 1637. He had six galleys and many more small ships under his command, which roamed the Mediterranean, attacking and pillaging the coasts of Christian Europe and gaining considerable revenue and power for Tunis; he also faced ships from Florence and Malta which frequently depredated the African coasts in a similar way. In 1628 he was named \\"supreme commander\\" of the Tunisian army during a short war against the Eyalet of Algeria and, although defeated, he preserved the prestige which he enjoyed thanks to his prowess. He became wealthy enough to become the owner of a corsair fleet himself. He linked himself with several people who were important in Tunisian public life in order to improve his own affairs. As he consolidated his position he did not forget his origins or try to renounce his biological family. Initially he was rejoined by his father who, thanks to his son's intercession, became an important intermediary working with the magistrate for the redemption of slaves, an institution founded in 1597 to promote the freeing of Ligurian prisoners held by Barbary pirates. In addition to his father, he was reunited with his brothers, who maintained his business relations Genoa, Livorno and Marseilles. Their enormous wealth reinforced Murad's position in the early years of the seventeenth century. Aerial view of Ghar el-Melh and its port, founded by Usta Murad in 1638 At Yusuf Dey's death in 1637, Usta Murad took power by force, with the help of another renegade, Mami Ferrarese, whom he later eliminated, and the support of the Muradid sovereign Hammuda Pasha Bey, even though the Divan of the Turkish militia of Tunis was hostile to him because he was of foreign origin and all other Deys of Tunis had been of Turkish birth. He controlled the beylic alongside Hammuda for three years, maintaining good relations with France and expanding the corsair port of Porto Farina (later Ghar el-Melh), located at a strategic coastal site, which increasingly supplanted Bizerte. His vast house was located on the street of judges in the quarter of Tourbet el Bey, within the Medina of Tunis. He built his mausoleum on the current Bab Menara road. His reign was cut short by his death in June 1640. His descendants remain among the foremost families of Tunis down to the present day. His great grandson, Hammuda Stamrad was the brother-in-law and supporter of Hussayn I Bey after his deposition by Ali I Pasha in 1735. He shared the fate of his ally, being executed in the heart of the Bardo palace in 1740.  References  =Citations= = Bibliography = * Marco Biagioni, Pirati nel golfo, √©d.

Background After his resurgence on the country charts, Lewis and producer Jerry Kennedy opted to record two albums worth of classic country songs in four sessions spread over two days as a way to fulfill his obligation to his record label, Smash, for 1969. As country music historian Colin Escott notes in his essay for the 1986 retrospective The Killer: The Smash/Mercury Years, \\"Not only did this avoid the problem of screening new material but it also gained Jerry some instant credibility in his new found quest to be viewed as a country artist.\\" The album includes country standards such as \\"Sweet Dreams\\", made famous by Patsy Cline, and the classic Hank Williams lament \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\". The duet \\"Jackson\\" features Linda Gail Lewis. Critics have often cited the rushed nature of the sessions as a reason for the album's uniform feel when compared to Lewis's previous albums Another Place, Another Time and She Still Comes Around, but in truth the tight schedule likely had little impact since Lewis would usually record no more than two takes of a song if he could get away with it. The album soared to number 2 on the Billboard country albums chart. It was during this period that Lewis appeared at the Toronto Peace Festival in front of twenty thousand people, sharing the bill with John Lennon and Alice Cooper as well as fellow rock and roll icons Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Little Richard.

Prior to 10 March 1451, Barbara contracted her third marriage with Nicholas V, Duke of Racib√≥rz, Krnov, Brunt√°l and Rybnik, who belonged to an illegitimate branch of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. For the Duke, this was his second marriage with a woman from the local middle-class (his first wife was Margaret Clemm of Ellguth, also from bourgeois origins). The P≈ôemyslid Dukes of Racib√≥rz mainly married with members from the Czech and Polish nobility;Rafa≈Ç Prinke, Andrzej Sikorski: Ma≈Çgorzata z Felbrigg. Piast√≥wna cieszy≈Ñska na dworze Ryszarda II kr√≥la Anglii. \\"Roczniki Historyczne\\".

This union, who lasted almost two years, produced two children in quick succession: a son, Nicholas (who died in infancy and was buried at Wawel Cathedral) and a daughter, Margareta (also known as Machna), wife of Duke Casimir II of Zator. =Rule over Pszczyna= After the death of the third husband, about 22 December 1452, Barbara took possession of the district of Pszczyna as her dower.

During her government, Duchess Helena confirmed a document dated from 1407 who guaranteed the conformation of the entire castellany of Pszczyna (including the towns of Miko≈Ç√≥w and Bieru≈Ñ with their surrounding villages). As a ruler of Pszczyna, in 1454 Barbara hosted in her town the Polish Queen Elizabeth of Austria. In the same year, her brother-in-law Wenceslaus II attempted to take by force her domains, and send troops to Pszczyna; however, his early death in 1456 allowed Barbara not only to regain the full control over her lands but also obtained the regency of the Duchy on behalf of her stepsons. In 1457 Barbara concluded an agreement with the Polish King Casimir IV, concerning with reciprocal help against armed robberies in their lands. In 1458 almost all the district of Pszczyna was burned. In 1462 Barbara was expelled from her domains by her stepson John IV, who with the help of knights disguised as women entered and captured the main city of Pszczyna, forcing the Duchess to escape, leaving behind her brother Hieronim, who was arrested.Piotr Drzyzga: ≈ölƒÖski Odys i jego brat in: kultura.wiara.pl [retrieved 31 January 2015]. The quickly capture of the district was facilitated by the fact that although Barbara had the land, the local fortress was in possession of John IV. The last mention of Barbara as a living person was in Krak√≥w documents from 12 November 1463. In 1464 her stepsons made the division of their domains between them, including Pszczyna. In the 19th century was found a document dated on 18 February 1462 in Krak√≥w, where was preserved the personal seal of Barbara, impressed in red wax.

Background The album concludes producer Jerry Kennedy's concept of having Lewis record standards from the country music genre, further cementing his new reputation as a country music artist. Since his comeback single \\"Another Place, Another Time\\" in 1968, Lewis had enjoyed a successful commercial run with four top five country hits, and this streak continued when the Eddie Dean song \\"One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)\\" was released as a single and climbed to number three. Like Vol. 1, its sequel features covers of classic country songs by the likes of Hank Williams, Don Gibson, and Jim Reeves, as well as a duet with Jerry Lee's sister Linda Gail Lewis. It was not quite as successful as its predecessor, peaking at number five on the Billboard' country albums chart. The decision to record two albums worth of older country hits in a two-day session had more to do with Lewis fulfilling his contractual obligations for 1969 (three albums) rather than being necessitated by a lack of new material.

An≈°lavs Eglƒ´tis (October 14, 1906 ‚Äì March 4, 1993) was a Latvian writer, journalist and painter who became a war refugee in 1944. He had prolific career as a novelist, and his later work often examined aspects of exile life.  Biography  An≈°lavs Eglƒ´tis was born in Riga, Latvia, the first of two children born to his parents. His father, Viktors Eglƒ´tis, was a Latvian writer who was one of the most notable representatives of Decadence in Latvian literature. During the First World War, his family lived in Russia, but returned to Latvia in 1918. For a short time they settled in Al≈´ksne. After 1919, his family lived in Riga and Eglƒ´tis started his studies in Riga City gymnasium No. 2. He also studied painting in the studio of a Latvian painter VoldemƒÅrs Tone at this time. The family spent all their summer holidays in Inciems cottage, which he later described in his novel Pansija pilƒ´ (1962). He caught tuberculosis in 1925. His mother, who suffered pulmonary disease, died during his stay in Leysin sanatorium. He continued his studies in the Art Academy of Latvia and graduated in 1935. After graduation he worked as a teacher of drawing. In 1936 his first collection of novels Maestro was published. In 1938 Eglƒ´tis started to work as a journalist in the biggest Latvian newspaper JaunƒÅkƒÅs zi≈Üas. In 1940, he also collaborated on the magazine Atp≈´ta. He left Riga for Courland in October 1944 and later fled to Germany where he settled in Berlin. During the Battle of Berlin his flat was destroyed in an air raid and Eglƒ´tis moved to Switzerland. In 1950, he moved to California, USA. His father, writer Viktors Eglƒ´tis, was arrested, tortured and killed in the Cheka building in Riga in 1945. His grave is unknown. In his American exile, Eglƒ´tis wrote more than 50 novels and short stories. Parallel to his literature career he became a theatre and film critic for the Latvian newspaper Laiks published in Brooklyn, NY, which also serialized a number of his novels. In 1957, his Neierasta Amerika began to be serialized in the Soviet Latvian magazine Zvaigzne, but it was immediately qualified as an 'import of bourgeois nationalism' and soon discontinued. The success of his works resides in their avangardist flavour combined with loyalty to the popular taste. In post-Soviet Latvia, his Shameless Old Men directed by Mihail Kublinskis, is one of the most successful productions of the National Theater. He died of cancer in Los Angeles in 1993. In 2006, the Latvian Post issued a commemorative stamp in honor of Eglƒ´tis. A monument to the writer was installed in 2008 in Inciems.

It was tasked with preserving the \\"traditional genius\\" of the country; among other things, the native Ethiopic script and the literary and scholarly tradition it enabled, as well as the \\"promotion of research in languages and fine arts\\". In 1956 Emperor Haile Selassie promulgated a decree chartering the Academy as an independent organisation. The Academy, as a single body, eventually ceased to operate during the time of the Derg regime in the 1980s, although some of its constituent organizations have persisted- directly or indirectly- to the present. Constituent bodies At the time of its foundation, the Academy comprised three subsidiary groups: The Language and Literature Council, the Fine Arts Council, and the Science and Technology Council. =Language and Literature= The role of the Language and Literature Council, after its establishment, over time shifted from the academic study of languages and literature towards that of a Language regulator (i.e. the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise or the Real Academia Espa√±ola) for the Amharic language. In light of this, it was reorganised into the National Academy of the Amharic Language in 1972. It was charged with setting the national language policy as to \\"foster the growth of the Amharic language\\" and to \\"encourage the development of its literature\\". To this end, it designed a programme of spelling reform (albeit unimplemented), published compilations of Ethiopian proverbs (in multiple language), volumes of translated Ge'ez-language poetry, technical and bi- lingual dictionaries, and multiple professional journals. After the overthrow of the imperial government by the left-wing Derg (Coordinating Council of the Armed Forces) in the 1974 coup d'√©tat and the installation of a socialist military government, the Language Academy was seen as a chauvinistic vehicle of linguistic imperialism, and one that favoured of the tongue of the ruling elite at the expense of the country's eight dozen other languages and dialects. As a result, in 1979 it was transformed into the Academy of Ethiopian Languages under the Ministry of Culture and Sport, whose regulatory remit extended to all Ethiopian languages. It had four academic subcommittees: lexicography, linguistics, terminology, and literature- both written and oral (the inclusion of the latter signifying a significant break with the prior emphasis on Ge'ez and its literary tradition). It continued to operate after the fall of the military regime as an independent organization until 1997, when it became a research body of Addis Ababa University, known as the Ethiopian Languages Research Centre until 2010, when it was restored to the status of an autonomous academy and language regulator and renamed as Academy of Ethiopian Languages and Cultures. In 2013, however, the entirely separate Regional Somali Language Academy, based in Djibouti, was set up by multinational agreement- including Ethiopia- as the international regulator of Somali language. =Fine Arts= The Fine Arts Council, later the Academy of Fine Arts, counted, among others, Baalu Girma, Afewerk Tekle, and Ashenafi Kebede as members. It had ceased to operate by the time of the fall of the Derg in 1991. =Science and Technology= The Science and Technology Council, later the Academy of Sciences and Technology, became defunct some time during the rule of the Derg. However, it can be considered to have a partial successor in the form of the Ethiopian Academy of Sciences, which was founded in 2010 following the efforts of academics, such as the historian Bahru Zewde, over several years to establish such an organisation. Its mission was declared as to \\"advance the development of all the sciences, including the natural sciences, mathematics, the health sciences, agricultural sciences, engineering, social sciences and humanities, fine arts and letters, making its envisioned scope closer to that of the entire Imperial Academy than just the sciences.

It was built in 1881 and designed by Ingress Bell. It is situated between Essendene Road and Whyteleafe Road off the High Street. It is a Grade II listed building.Caterham The Sacred Heart of Jesus from English Heritage, retrieved 26 January 2015 Construction In 1879, after a request from Francis Parson, a local Catholic, the Bishop of Southwark, James Danell, sent Fr Francis Roe to Caterham to serve as priest there. Hs first Mass was on 24 August 1879 in a local depot,Church History from Sacred-Heart.co.uk, retrieved 26 January 2015 where army officers built a temporary chapel. Before this, a priest from Croydon travelled to Caterham to celebrate Mass for soldiers and local Catholics. On 24 June 1880, the foundation stone of the church was laid by Bishop Danell. Most of the construction was paid for by Fr Roe's father, Captain William Harriott Roe. The architect for the church was Ingress Bell, who also designed St Joseph Church in Guildford in 1881, but that was demolished in the 1980s. He adopted the Early English Gothic Revival style and a cruciform plan. On 11 August 1881 the church was opened. The first Mass was celebrated by the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Manning and attended by the Bishop of Middlesbrough, Richard Lacy, because Bishop Danell died in June 1881. Interior The windows and painted murals around the apse were built by Hardman & Co. The murals were designed by Joseph Aloysius Pippet. Illustrating the life of Jesus, they are not contemporary with the church: it was stated in 1907 that \\"[t]he sanctuary has been recently adorned with elegant mosaic pictures\\". Parish The parish covers the Catholic population of Caterham, Whyteleafe and Godstone. The church has three Sunday Masses. They are at 9:00am and 10:45am on Sunday morning and at 5:15pm on Sunday afternoon. There are weekday Masses at 10:00am from Monday to Thursday, at 7:00pm on Friday and at 10:00am on Saturday morning. Whyteleafe had its own church until 2010. St Thomas of Canterbury's Church was designed by Broadbent and Partners architects (scheme architect J.F.G Hastings) in 1961 and registered for marriages in November of that year, but it closed temporarily in October 2010 and was threatened with demolition. In 2015 funds were raised to restore the Pippet murals which had been badly damaged by water ingress, the work being carried out by Hirst Conservation.

He was later a cricket administrator and a prominent Auckland sharebroker. Playing career A middle-order, and later opening, batsman and occasional bowler, Hay made his first-class debut for Auckland in 1893-94. In 1894-95 he made 55, the highest score of the match, when Auckland beat Hawke's Bay by five wickets. Apart from that innings his record was modest in his early years, and he made only 228 runs at an average of 12.66 in 11 matches over six seasons. Nevertheless, he played for a New Zealand XV against the touring Australians in 1896-97, batting at number nine and scoring 10 and 4. He took 5 for 10 off nine overs to finish off the Wellington first innings later that season. Then, in 1900-01, he was the highest scorer in New Zealand, with 292 runs at 41.71. Early in January 1901, opening the batting against Canterbury, he made 37 and 60 (Auckland's top score) then, a few days later, he made 144 and 20 not out against Wellington. Hay's 144 was Auckland's first century in their 38th match of first-class cricket. After Wellington had made 397 in their first innings, Auckland lost wickets steadily and were 112 for 7 at one stage. Hay \\"took over two hours to make his first 50, [but] in the next hour and a-half rattled on nearly double that number ... just when Auckland's plight seemed hopeless, he let out in most brilliant style and found the boundary time after time with powerful drives and leg strokes ... his 144 was a remarkable display of defence combined with hitting\\". Having gone in first, he was last out with Auckland's total at 262.Auckland Star, 9 January 1901, p. 3. After those few days of success he returned to his previous form, and in 10 first-class matches after 1900-01 he made only 169 runs at 9.38. He was selected for New Zealand in two matches against Lord Hawke's visiting English team in 1902-03, but made only 28 runs in four innings.Don Neely & Richard Payne, Men in White: The History of New Zealand International Cricket, 1894‚Äì1985, Moa, Auckland, 1986, pp. 43-44.

De Pont has been named after the attorney and businessman Jan de Pont (1915-1987), whose estate provided for the establishment of a foundation to stimulate contemporary visual art in 1988. With its founding director Hendrik Driessen, the decision was made to transform a Tilburg wool-spinning mill into a museum. Since its opening in 1992, the collection has grown to include more than 800 works by approximately eighty nationally and internationally known artists, among them Marlene Dumas, Bill Viola and Anish Kapoor.  History  Attorney Jan de Pont, who died in 1987, had decided that part of his estate was to be used to stimulate contemporary art, but left it up to the board of the new foundation to determine how and where that would take shape. This created the exceptional situation of a private ‚Äòmuseum‚Äô (director Hendrik Driessen avoided this term for the first couple of years, in the belief that one has to earn such a title) which did not begin with a collection bequeathed by the founder, and which made no appeal for support from government organizations or funds. That financial independence continues to exist to this day. The fact that the museum eventually came to be located in Tilburg has had everything to do with Jan de Pont. As a former resident of this city, he was concerned about the fate of the vanishing textile industry and, during the 1960s, had helped the Thomas de Beer wool-spinning mill to get back on its feet after bankruptcy. Twenty years later the business could eventually no longer compete with corporations abroad and had to discontinue its operations. This conveniently coincided with the foundation‚Äôs search for housing. The property was acquired for a symbolic amount, and four of the six remaining employees of the mill were hired by the foundation. De Pont opened its doors on September 12, 1992. Since then, the museum has expanded both its collection and its building. Since 2016 photography and video art have been displayed in the museum‚Äôs new wing specially designed for this purpose. Hendrik Driessen retired in June 2019, passing on the directorship to Martijn van Nieuwenhuyzen.  Collection  Since De Pont Foundation had no collection from the start, its acquisition policy could be determined beforehand. It was decided that there would be no focus on a specific generation, art-historical movement or social ideology, nor on a specific art form. The only stipulation was that the artworks were to be created by living artists. The visual strength of the artwork itself was the sole focus. After the acquisition of a small painting of Rob Birza (Untitled (The Hand)) was approved by the board, Hendrik Driessen soon started to collect some large and iconic art works, such as Richard Long‚Äôs Planet Circle and The First People by Marlene Dumas. Four artists with distinct reputations in contemporary art -- James Turrell, Gerhard Merz, Richard Serra and Richard Long ‚Äì were asked to produce a work in situ for the first presentation of the collection. The museum had set a goal to collect in terms of depth rather than breadth, meaning that the acquisition policy involved following a limited number of artists over a longer period of time, with the intention of collecting 'key works' within a body of work that could represent the essence of that artist‚Äôs outlook. In order to achieve that, distinct choices had to be made; and so the collection has grown in a relatively slow manner. Over the years the museum has come to own roughly 800 works, more than half of which is photography or work on paper, by eighty different artists. A number of them‚Äî including Berlinde De Bruyckere, Thierry De Cordier, Anton Henning, Roni Horn, Anri Sala, Fiona Tan, Robert Therrien, Rosemarie Trockel, Luc Tuymans and Mark Wallinger ‚Äî were introduced to the Netherlands or given their first major exhibition by De Pont. The museum has consistently shown three major exhibitions a year highlighting the oeuvre of one of the artists from the collection. In addition, there are smaller solo exhibitions in the ‚Äòpodium space‚Äô that are not directly related to the collection.

Official website of Museum De Pont. Accessdate 2 February 2015}} Apart from the Hallen f√ºr Neue Kunst in Schaffhausen, De Pont was among the first museums to be housed in a formerly industrial space, thus setting an example for future museums, most notably serving as an inspiration during the planning stages of Tate Modern in London. The building had all the distinguishing characteristics of a Dutch factory: functionally and technically, it comprised no more than was absolutely necessary. This is why the roof and the floor of the large hall were completely renovated and all the walls restored. Benthem Crouwel Architects, however, maintained the factory‚Äôs original character as the point of departure. The firm's six-month renovation resulted in a distinctive and widely praised museum building with both a spacious exhibition space and small wool-storage rooms, suitable for a more intimate encounter with the art. Since the opening, the museum has been expanded several times: with the addition of a project space and an auditorium in 2002, and with a completely new exhibition space of 1100 square meters in 2016. This ‚ÄòNew Wing‚Äô, once again carried out by Benthem Crouwel Architects, was specially designed to accommodate film, video art, photography and works on paper. The same renovation also included an expansion of the restaurant and a new salon designed by Anton Henning. The museum‚Äôs forecourt is dubbed Meester J.H. de Pontplein after the founder. On the occasion of the museum‚Äôs twentieth anniversary in 2012, the municipality of Tilburg adorned its street side with an entrance gate consisting of several connected passages. Five years later, Anish Kapoor designed Sky Mirror (for Hendrik), for the museum's twenty-fifth anniversary. This characteristic free-standing mirror, reflecting the sky, is the first Kapoor to be placed in Dutch public space. It is surrounded by a garden designed by landscape architect Sophie Walker, completing the museum‚Äôs characteristic entrance.

He directed The Fair Love (2010), The Russian Novel (2013), and Rough Play (2013). Career Born in Seoul in 1976, Shin Yeon-shick dropped out of his Spanish Studies major at university to pursue a career in filmmaking. He made his directorial debut in 2003 with Piano Lesson, made on a micro-budget of . In 2005, Shin wrote and directed the black-and-white indie A Great Actor, which had its international premiere at the International Film Festival Rotterdam. His next film was The Fair Love (2010), a nuanced, lyrical inter- generational romance starring Ahn Sung-ki and Lee Ha-na. But despite its well- known actors and positive reviews, the film was a box office failure with mainstream audiences. Shin continued making low-budget experimental films. The Russian Novel, an ambitious arthouse drama about a depressed author (played by Kang Shin-hyo) who wakes up from a 27-year coma to find himself a literary sensation for a novel he didn't write, drew even more critical acclaim. The Director's Guild of Korea named Shin as Best Director at the 17th Busan International Film Festival in 2012, and he also won Best Screenplay from the Korean Association of Film Critics Awards and the Buil Film Awards. In 2013, he directed Rough Play (titled \\"An Actor Is an Actor\\" in Korean) from a screenplay by Kim Ki-duk about the dark underbelly of the Korean film industry through a young actor's quick rise and fall, and cast K-pop star Lee Joon in the leading role. Shin was determined to reshape Kim's symbolism-heavy script into a more narrative-driven, commercial film, and during post-production he rewrote and reshot 50% of the film. This was followed by The Avian Kind, in which a man goes on a road trip to search for his missing wife, and finally finds her 15 years later, only she's transformed into a bird. It made its world premiere at the Jeonju International Film Festival as part of the 2014 Jeonju Digital Project, and received a theatrical release in 2015. Shin then shared screenwriting credit with Kim Sung-ho for How to Steal a Dog (2014). His upcoming project Like a French Film is an omnibus composed of four short films titled A Time to Leave, A Lady Selling Beer, A Remaining Time and Like a French Film, starring Shin Min-cheol and Kim Dasom.

It was developed in Rochester, New York when it became likely that imports from the Kodak AG factory in Germany could be disrupted by war. While Kodak had invented the Kodak 135 daylight-loading film cassette in 1934, prior to 1938 they only offered the German made Kodak Retina to work with this cartridge. US built 35mm cameras used the 828 paper backed 35mm roll-film (Bantam Series). The original viewfinder model The first Kodak 35 has no rangefinder. It slightly resembles cameras like the German Wirgin Edinex and Adox Adrette. It takes thirty-six 24√ó36 mm frames on 135 film. The precision molded black Bakelite body has satin-chromed top and base plates, and a collapsible finder is mounted on top center. The removable Bakelite back with the attached base plate slides easily off for film handling. It is secured by a centrally located wing key in the base plate. Turning the key also slackens the spring tension of the chromed steel film pressure plate, a very unusual feature presumably incorporated to facilitate reassembling the camera rather than preventing scratching the film during rewind, which would have been a novel feature. Prominently placed at the top are the large wind-on and rewind knobs, the right-hand one is the film advance knob, both to be operated in the clockwise direction. Next to it is a manually reset automatic frame counter dial and the chromed wind-on release button, the latter not to be mistaken for the shutter release. The front element focusing Kodak lens has a rigid lensmount set in a Kodak inter-lens shutter. The shutter is cocked by a gear coupling to the sprocket-wheel drum, which is trailing along with the passing film during the wind-on operation. Hence, there is no shutter cocking without a film in the camera. An automatic mechanism locates the next frame on the film by locking the advance knob. It is released for the next frame by depressing the wind-on release button before turning the wind-on knob. This prevents double exposure, but not blank frames since nothing prevents pressing the button again and advance the film. However, a red indicator is shown to the left in a slot on the top of the shutter cover that indicates the camera has been wound. The shutter release, in the shape of a rearward-pointing pin attached to the shutter release lever, is situated at about 10-o'clock at the shutter housing. It is protected from being accidentally triggered by a small cover extending over it. Rewinding the film into its cassette is accomplished by first pulling the wind-on knob to its raised position followed by turning the left-hand top mounted rewind-knob clock-wise; this is accompanied by a rattling noise. It is not possible to raise the wind-on knob if it is not free to rotate, it is freed by turning the knob clock-wise while depressing the double exposure prevention button. The frame counter dial rotates during rewind as long as the film passes the sprocket wheel drum. The wind gears, which is visible inside the machined steel film chamber. All internal metal parts are either plated steel or brass. The film pressure-plate is chrome-plated polished steel, while the other parts are nickel-plated. A variety of lens and shutter combinations appeared during the production period: *1938-1945: Kodak Anastigmat f/5.6 50mm in KODEX SHUTTER, or *1938-1949: Kodak Anastigmat Special f/3.5 51mm in KODAMATIC SHUTTER, or *1946-1947: Kodak Anastigmat f/4.5 50mm in FLASH DIOMATIC SHUTTER, *1947-1948: Kodak Anastigmat Special f/3.5 51mm in FLASH KODAMATIC SHUTTER, or *1947-1948: Kodak Anaston f/4.5 50mm in FLASH DIOMATIC SHUTTER. The improved model with rangefinder Main article After some two years, the Eastman Kodak Company presented an improved Kodak 35 camera, known as the Kodak 35 Rangefinder, with a new superstructure housing a viewfinder and a separate rangefinder, but without any addition to the identifying inscription on the body. It is generally referred to as the RF model. The variations in finish and specifications Several finishes appeared during the production run. The body is black Bakelite and top and base is chromed metal. When first introduced the collapsible viewfinder on top of the camera was black and the knobs on top of the camera were black Bakelite, while the military viewfinder camera were olive drab with blackened metal parts. There were no civil production between 1942 and 1945. The post-war viewfinder and the rangefinder models were also black with bright-chromed metal features, and an accessory shoe was added to the viewfinder model next to the rewind knob. However, for a while during the period from 1947 to 1949, the knobs were also made of white plastic instead of metal. Both the metal- and the white rewind knobs have a film reminder dial in the hub. A few minor modifications were also made to internal parts, notably to the film pressure plate spring that changes through a variety of shapes from rod to flat shape. Most, if not all shutters alternatives have a No. 5 Cable Release socket with a tiny removable coin- slotted screw plug, while the later ones also have a Kodak type flash synchroniser contact post. A metal band inscribed \\"Made in U.S.A.\\" was attached to the top of the shutter housing cover plate, save for the last year or two of production. The milling pattern on the focusing wheel front goes through a variety of styles from flat to a pattern of several concentric circles. The Kodak 35 came with a hard brown leather ever-ready case. Dating the Year of Manufacture The serial number on a Kodak manufactured lens is always preceded by a code consisting of two capital letters that indicates the year of manufacture using a 10 letter key word, CAMEROSITY, in which each letter in the word represents a corresponding numeral in the sequence 1234567890. Of these, the C is substituted by 1, the A by 2 etc. through to the Y by 0. \\"ET\\" thus gives the number 49 for the year 1949. The Kodak 35 serial number is engraved on the front ring on the lens.

Bron, S. G. Bron; ), (25 January 1887, Odessa - 21 April 1938, Kommunarka, Butovo) was a Soviet trade representative in United States and Great Britain. He is best known as Chairman of Amtorg Trading Corporation in New York City (1927-1930) and Chairman of the All- Russian Co-operative Society (ARCOS) in London (1930-1931). He became a victim of Stalin's Great Purge and was executed on 21 April 1938. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956. Early years Saul Grigorievich (Shoil Gershkovich) Bron was born 25 January 1887 in Odessa (Ukraine, Russian Empire), in a Jewish family. He graduated the Odessa gymnasium and began his higher education at the Kiev Institute of Commerce (now Kiev State Economic University). From 1905 to 1907 he continued his education in Europe, where he studied the grain trade and earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Zurich. After his return to Ukraine, he participated in development of Jewish agricultural colonies in Kherson Gubernia and taught at Novopoltavka Jewish agricultural school. Political affiliation As a student at Kiev Commercial Institute Bron was involved in the social-democratic movement, popular among secular Jews in the Ukraine as a reaction to anti-Semitism in the Russian Empire. In 1913 became a member of the Jewish Social Democratic Labor Party of Ukraine; in 1918-1919 - socialist-federalist. In 1919 became a member of VKP(b), after the latter merged with the Jewish Communist Party (a split-off of the Jewish Social Democratic Labor Party). Professional career In 1921 Bron became a member of the Central Executive Committee of Ukraine. In 1921‚Äì1923 he acted as commissioner for foreign trade of Ukrainian SSR and representative of the People's Commissariat of Trade and Industry of the RSFSR at the Council of People's Commissars of Ukraine; he was also a member of the Collegium of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.

In 1924 he began work for the People's Commissariat of Trade and Industry of the RSFSR and was appointed Director of the Russian Bank for Foreign Trade (Roskombank, later Vneshtorgbank USSR). In 1925‚Äì1926 he headed the Soviet grain exporting agency, Exportkhleb. (He was successor of the first President of the agency, Leonid Krasin.) In 1926 Bron began his work for the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade of the USSR (under A. I. Mikoyan), and in March 1927 was appointed chairman of Amtorg Trading Corporation in New York. Prior to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the USSR in 1933, Amtorg, technically a private corporation, served as a de facto trade delegation and a quasi-embassy of the USSR. Bron was the third chairman of Amtorg. He replaced A. V. Prigarin (1925‚Äì1926) and was replaced by P. A. Bogdanov (1930‚Äì1934). Bron was the first president of Amtorg whose command of English enabled him to negotiate without the aid of interpreters (he was also fluent in German and French). His tenure (1927‚Äì1930) concurred with the introduction of the first five-year plan, and his role was to contract with major American companies to help build Soviet industrial infrastructure. On 9 October 1928 and 24 May 1929 Bron signed two contracts with International General Electric (I.G.E.), which became a key element in carrying out the electrification plan of the Soviet Union (GOELRO). In Dearborn, Michigan, he negotiated the US$30m contract with the Ford Motor Company for assistance in building the first Soviet automobile plant (GAZ) near Nizhnii Novgorod (Gorky). This contract was signed on 31 May 1929 by Henry Ford and Peter E. Martin on behalf of the company, by Bron, representing Amtorg, and by V. I. Mezhlauk, representing VSNKh. An additional two-part US$40m contract for construction of the plant was signed with The Austin Company on 23 August and 30 October 1929. On 8 May 1929 Bron signed an historic contract with the firm of the leading American industrial architect from Detroit, Albert Kahn, to design the first Soviet tractor plant in Stalingrad (now Volgograd). On 9 January 1930 he signed the second contract with Kahn for his firm to become consulting architects for all industrial construction in the Soviet Union. Under these contracts, during 1929‚Äì1932, Kahn's firm, at its headquarters in Detroit and the especially created design bureau in Moscow, Gosproektstroi, trained over 4,000 Soviet architects and engineers and designed over 500 plants and factories, including Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and Uralmash plant in Sverdlovsk. Among other American firms, commissioned by Bron to provide technical aid to the USSR, were Hugh L. Cooper (construction of the Dneproges Dam), Arthur G. McKee (design and construction of Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant), Freyn Engineering (Novokuznetsk Metallurgical Plant), DuPont de Nemours, Radio Corporation of America, and more than a hundred other companies. In 1930 Bron was transferred to London, where he was appointed chairman of ARCOS and head of the USSR Trade Delegation in Great Britain. During 1930‚Äì1931 he negotiated and signed several large contracts with British firms, including Imperial Chemical Industries, Armstrong-Vickers, Associated British Machine Tool Makers, and Metropolitan- Vickers Electrical Company. On 20 September 1931, on Stalin's initiative, the Politburo recalled Bron back to the USSR. He remained a member of the Collegium of the Commissariat of Foreign Trade and in 1933 was appointed Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of the USSR. However, in 1935, he was demoted and given a job as a deputy to the head of the State publishing agency OGIZ, Mikhail P. Tomsky. Arrest and death Bron was arrested on 25 October 1937. He was falsely accused of being a member of an anti-Soviet terrorist organization; of preparing, together with Tomsky, a terrorist act against Stalin; and of being an agent of British intelligence. After five months in Lubyanka prison, on 21 April 1938 he was tried in a closed session by the troika (the three-member Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR). He was sentenced to death and was executed the same day. Bron was buried in a mass grave at Kommunarka, Butovo, near Moscow, one of the sites of mass executions during Stalin's Great Terror in the 1930s‚Äì1950s. He was posthumously rehabilitated by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 25 April 1956. Family From 1931 to 1937, Bron and his family resided in Moscow, at 2/20 Serafimovich Street, apt. No. 403, a newly built massive building across the river from the Kremlin, known as Dom pravitel'stva (\\"Government House\\"), the residence of the upper echelons of the Soviet hierarchy, described by Yuri Trifonov in his novel, House on the Embankment. After Bron's arrest, his wife, Klara Bron, was arrested too, and the children, son Lev and daughter Miriam, were evicted from the apartment and banished from Moscow. Klara (Chaya) Azarievna Bron (Kholodovskaia) was born in 1885 in Uman, Kievskaya Gubernia. She worked as a researcher at the Institute of World Economy and World Politics, Moscow. Arrested in 1937 as a \\"family member of a traitor of the Motherland\\"; sentenced on 16 May 1938 by Special Council of the NKVD of USSR to 8 years at Akmolinsk labor camp No.17 for wives of \\"traitors of the Motherland\\" (ALZHIR) in Kazakhstan. She did not survive her term and died on 25 January 1945. She was rehabilitated in 1956.

Known for his eight extant fu (rhapsody) poems, he also wrote an influential preface to the collected works of Wang Bo, in which he criticized the excessive formality of the court poetry of the preceding generation, and lauded the classical style of Wang Bo and Lu Zhaolin. Life Yang Jiong was born in Huayin in today's Shaanxi province. A child prodigy, Yang Jiong passed the special civil service examination for boys and was awarded with an official appointment to the prestigious Hongwen College in 659, when he was only nine years old. Unlike the other three \\"paragons\\", He spent most of his life serving at the imperial court in the capital Chang'an. He later served as the magistrate of Yingchuan County, and became commonly known as Yang Yingchuan (). He died under unremarkable circumstances while in office, the only one of the \\"Four Paragons\\" to do so. Works The imperial bibliographies of the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang both recorded 30 juan (volumes) of Yang Jiong's collected works. However, the Chongwen Catalog of the Northern Song dynasty recorded 20 juan. Yang Jiong's shi poems are not exceptional, but he is best known for his eight extant fu poems, most prominently \\"The Enveloping Sky\\", \\"The Old Man Star\\", and \\"Ullambana\\". His fu are described as \\"rich confections of scholarly lore and wordplay\\", some of which provide insight into the astral beliefs of the Tang dynasty. Yang Jiong also wrote the preface for the collected works of Wang Bo, published after Wang's premature death. Yang criticized the \\"aberrant style\\" of the preceding generation of poetry, which became widely accepted by traditional scholars. In contrast, he lauded Wang Bo's classical style and praised Lu Zhaolin for checking the excessive formality of the court poetry.

Fulton Creek originates within The Meadows area of Edmonton, Alberta. As with other urban Edmonton waterways, with long stretches running through underground culverts, and water volume managed by other urban land uses and for erosion control, Fulton Creek has been labeled a lost creek.  Origination  Fulton Creek originates in the southeastern section of Edmonton, from the Fulton Marsh in the Maple neighbourhood. The Fulton Marsh is a constructed wetland, created after the original was drained in the 1990s in anticipation of the development of Maple, which started after 2010. Fulton Marsh is now a protected wetland that conserves the native flora and fauna in the area. As Fulton Creek travels its generally north-northwestern route to the North Saskatchewan River, it receives water from other smaller streams that have mostly disappeared from view. Water course Fulton Creek, after discharging from the Fulton Marsh Constructed Wetland, runs through a number of Edmonton light to medium industrial parks and residential neighbourhoods: * Fulton Marsh Constructed Wetland in the Maple neighbourhood * Maple Ridge Industrial * Southeast Industrial * Pylypow Industrial * Weir Industrial Park * Davies Industrial East * Gainer Industrial * Kenilworth neighbourhood * Ottewell neighbourhood * Terrace Heights neighbourhood * Fulton Place neighbourhood * flows into North Saskatchewan River at outlet beside the Capilano Bridge Topography Fulton Creek has been culverted most of its way, in order for the City of Edmonton to build neighbourhoods in the surrounding areas. Due to being culverted, the creek's discharge into the river is very minimal and tends to dry up in the summer. Spring melt can cause the creek to overflow, allowing melt water to access the river. Over time, the City of Edmonton Drainage Department has added culverts and Gabion Check dams to address erosion and high flow incidents. The area surrounding the Fulton Marsh is generally flat with very minimal sloping. In areas where Fulton Creek emerges, a light depression begins to form. Towards the river, the creek slopes into a sharp and deep ravine. Fulton Creek moves through a short culvert underneath Whitemud Drive, between Maple and Maple Ridge Industrial. It is above ground through much of the Maple Ridge, Southeast and Pylypow industrial areas, moving back into a culvert near 43a Street and 69 Avenue in the northwest corner of Pylypow. The Creek remains in underground culverts through the Weir, Davies and Gainer industrial areas as well as the Kenilworth and Ottewell neighbourhoods. It emerges in ponding areas in a park on the northwest side of Austin O'Brien Catholic High School, on the north central edge of Ottewell. From there, with exceptions for culverts and ponding areas, Fulton Creek flows above ground through the park like Fulton Creek Ravine, which divides the Terrace Heights and Fulton Place neighbourhoods. Wayne Gretzky Drive runs through the side of the final northern section of the Fulton Creek Ravine, before the Drive crosses the Capilano Bridge and Fulton Creek discharges into the North Saskatchewan River.

Quinn and Lifschitz were subjected to online abuse during the Gamergate controversy, having both received death threats and doxing attacks.

They provide post-crisis counseling services, help seeking shelter, and access to experts in information security, white hat hacking, law enforcement, public relations and threat monitoring. The network tailors a unique plan of action for each victim and works with law enforcement, the media, and social media. They promise to help victims regardless of previous affiliations and ideology, including Gamergate supporters. The group has been credited with defusing a swatting attack by advising the target to preemptively contact the police. Quinn said the launch of Crash Override Network led to a renewed and heightened campaign of abuse, and the website underwent daily hack attempts.

He then moved to Princeton, where he served as Boswell Professor of Peace and War in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs from 1987 to 1998. He also headed the Woodrow Wilson School's Ph.D. program from 1993 to 1997. From there, Downs moved to New York University, where he served as chair of the Department of Politics from 1998 to 2001. He then rose to Dean of Social Science, serving in that capacity until 2009. According to Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Downs was \\"the first scholar to use non-cooperative game theory to model the effects of domestic uncertainty on international negotiations and to identify how to use tacit bargaining ... to resolve disputes and arms races without coercion.\\" He is also known for his work developing the theory of coordination goods. Downs died of heart failure on January 21, 2015, shortly after falling asleep after watching the State of the Union Address. Honors *Leonard D.

According to H√©ctor Landaeta, journalist and author of Chavismo, Narco-trafficking and the Military, the phenomenon began when Colombian drugs began to enter into Venezuela from corrupt border units and the \\"rot moved its way up the ranks.\\" History Reports that members of the Venezuelan militaryhttp://revolucionemosanzoategui.blogspot.com/2007/04/el-general-ramn- guilln-dvila-i.html were involved in drug trafficking began in the 1990s, though it was limited to taking payments and ignoring drug traffickers. It was alleged that officers of Hugo Ch√°vez's Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 that planned the 1992 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempts had created a group that participated in drug trafficking that was known as the \\"Cartel Bolivariano\\" or \\"Bolivarian Cartel\\". Following the 1992 coup attempts, the Los Angeles Times noted that Venezuelan officers may have sought to take over the government since there was \\"money to be made from corruption, particularly in drugs\\". In 1993, the term \\"Cartel de los Soles\\" or \\"Cartel of the Suns\\" was first used when allegations of two National Guard generals of the Anti-Drug National Command, Ram√≥n Guill√©n D√°vila and Orlando Hern√°ndez Villegas, were investigated for drug trafficking crimes. The term came from the general emblems that looked like suns on their uniforms. =Bolivarian government= The \\"Cartel of the Suns\\" name returned in 2004 by reporter and city council member Mauro Marcano. Shortly before he was murdered, Marcano alleged that Alexis Maneiro, head of the National Guard and the Direcci√≥n General de Inteligencia Militar, was involved in drug trafficking. According to Vice News, the Venezuelan government under Hugo Chavez expanded corruption to \\"unprecedented levels\\" in an already corrupt military. Chavez gave military officials millions of dollars for social programs that allegedly disappeared, also giving legal immunity to drug trafficking officials to maintain power and loyalty. When Chavez ousted the United States Drug Enforcement Administration in 2005, Venezuela became a more attractive route for drug trade. According to Colombian intelligence, an arrested drug vigilante stated that \\"senior figures in President Hugo Chavez's security forces to arrange drug shipments through Venezuela\\". It has been alleged that the National Guard had worked with the FARC with drug trade. British officials alleged that planes from Colombia would also be sheltered by Venezuelan Air Force bases. Incidents In September 2013, an incident allegedly linked to the Cartel of the Suns and involving men from the Venezuelan National Guard who placed 31 suitcases containing 1.3 tons of cocaine on an Air France flight astonished Charles de Gaulle Airport authorities as it was the largest seizure of cocaine recorded in mainland France. On 15 February 2014, a commander for the Venezuelan National Guard was stopped while driving to Valencia with his family and was arrested for having 554 kilos of cocaine in his possession. On 11 November 2015, DEA agents arrested in Haiti two relatives (an adopted son and a nephew) of Cilia Flores, the First Lady of Venezuela, while trying to move 800 kilograms of cocaine from Venezuela to the United States. A source from the DEA unofficially stated, that the large amounts of cocaine are able to pass through Venezuela due to corruption in the government.http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2015/11/11/autoridades-de-ee-uu-detienen- a-dos-familiares-de-la-primera-dama-de-venezuela/ Organization There are groups within the branches of the Armed Forces of Venezuela such as the Venezuelan Army, Venezuelan Navy, Venezuelan Air Force, and Venezuelan National Guard; from the lowest to the highest levels of personnel. =Low- level personnel= Allegedly, lower ranking National Guardsmen compete for positions at border checkpoints so they can be paid bribes for \\"illicit trade\\", though a large portion of bribes go to their superiors. Allegedly, the corrupt officials of the Cartel of the Suns traffic drugs from Colombia to Venezuela where they are shipped internationally. =High-level officials= The \\"Corrupt Venezuelan Regime,\\" according to the United States Department of Justice.  Nicol√°s Maduro  President of Venezuela Nicol√°s Maduro has personally promoted individuals accused of drug trafficking to high positions of the Venezuelan government. In May 2018, he was said to have received drug trafficking profits from Diosdado Cabello. Diosdado Cabello In January 2015, the former security chief of both Hugo Chavez and Diosdado Cabello, Leamsy Salazar, made accusations that Cabello was head of the Cartel of the Suns. Salazar was placed in witness protection, fleeing to the United States with assistance of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Special Operations Division after cooperating with the administration and providing possible details on Cabello's involvement with international drug trade. Salazar stated that he saw Cabello give orders on transporting tons of cocaine. The shipments of drugs were reportedly sent from the FARC in Colombia to the United States and Europe, with the possible assistance of Cuba. The alleged international drug operation had possibly involved other senior members of Venezuela's government as well, such as Tarek El Aissami and Jos√© David Cabello, Diosdado's brother. On 18 May 2018, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury placed sanctions in effect against Cabello, his wife, his brother and his \\"testaferro\\" (frontman) Rafael Sarria. OFAC stated that Cabello and others used their power within the Bolivarian government \\"to personally profit from extortion, money laundering, and embezzlement\\", with Cabello allegedly directing drug trafficking activities with Vice President of Venezuela, Tareck El Aissami while dividing profits with President Nicol√°s Maduro. The Office also stated that Cabello would use public information to track wealth individuals who were potentially drug trafficking and steal their drugs and property in order to get rid of potential competition.  Tareck El Aissami  Tareck El Aissami was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department on 13 February 2017 under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act after being accused of facilitating drug shipments from Venezuela to Mexico and the United States, freezing tens of millions of dollars of assets purportedly under El Aissami's control.  N√©stor Reverol  Head of the Bolivarian National Guard, N√©stor Reverol, has been indicted by the United States government in August 2016 of assisting with drug trafficking in Venezuela. Reverol allegedly tipped off traffickers, cancelled investigations and released those involved in drug shipments. Hugo Carvajal Hugo Carvajal is allegedly one of the leaders of the Cartel of the Suns. On July 22, 2014, Hugo Carvajal, former head of Venezuelan military-intelligence, was detained in Aruba, despite having been admitted on a diplomatic passport and being named consul general to Aruba in January. The arrest was carried out following a formal request by the U.S. government, which accuses Carvajal of ties to drug trafficking and to the FARC guerrilla group. On 27 July 2014, Carvajal was released after authorities decided he had diplomatic immunity, but was also considered persona non grata. On march of 2020, after an strategic 10 million dollar bounty imposed on Hugo Carvajal and other Venezuelan narcoterrorists, he decided to surrender to the U.S. Possibly to cut a deal with information on bigger Venezuelan corrupt governmental officials and narcoterrorists that are affiliated with Maduro's dictatorial regime. Not to mention Maduro himself has a 15 million dollar bounty https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/03/29/world/crime-legal- world/venezuela-spy-chief-hugo-carvajal-surrender-us/#.XoTacpNKho4. Yazenky Lamas Yazenky Lamas, former pilot to First Lady Cilia Flores, was extradited to the United States from Colombia, having allegedly provided air traffic codes to allow planes carrying cocaine to impersonate commercial flights. Venezuela President Nicol√°s Maduro reportedly asked Colombian Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas Echeverri to reject the request for extradition. Lamas has been linked to hundreds of drug flights operated in Venezuela.  Others  Other officials that are possibly involved with the Cartel of the Suns include: Allies =FARC= In 2005, all branches of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela were given the duty to combat drug trafficking in Venezuela, granting data once held only by the Bolivarian National Guard to the army, navy and air force. Mildred Camero, former anti- drug official of the Ch√°vez government, stated that this data created competition within the ranks of the military who fought to make deals with the FARC to actively partake in drug trafficking. Authorities in Colombia stated that through laptops they had seized on a raid against Raul Reyes in 2007, they found documents purporting to show that Hugo Ch√°vez offered payments of as much as $300 million to the FARC \\"among other financial and political ties that date back years\\" and documents showing the FARC rebels sought Venezuelan assistance in acquiring surface-to-air missiles, alleging that Chavez met personally with FARC rebel leaders. According to Interpol, the files found by Colombian forces were considered to be authentic. In 2008, the United States Department of Treasury accused two senior Venezuelan government officials and one former official of providing material assistance for drug-trafficking operations carried out by the FARC guerrilla group in Colombia. However, independent analyses of the documents by some U.S. academics and journalists have challenged the Colombian interpretation of the documents, accusing the Colombian government of exaggerating their contents. In 2008, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Jose Miguel Insulza, testified before the U.S. Congress that \\"there are no evidences\\" that Venezuela is supporting \\"terrorist groups\\", including the FARC. Three years later in 2011, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) concluded that Chavez's government funded FARC's Caracas office and granted it access to intelligence services. Venezuelan diplomats denounced the IISS' findings saying that they had \\"basic inaccuracies\\". Nevertheless, as of 2018, FARC dissidents who left FARC when it disbanded in 2017 still operate within Venezuela with virtual impunity. These dissident forces, with armed personnel numbering up to 2,500 individuals, allegedly still cooperate with the Cartel of the Suns.

He studies the quantitative behaviors of cell signaling systems and the origins and consequences of variation in them. He is Full Member in the Division of Basic Sciences at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and an Affiliate Professor of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. Early life Brent grew up in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and received his BA in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Southern Mississippi, where he applied AI techniques to protein folding. He performed PhD (1982)\\"Regulation of the cellular response to DNA damage\\" (1982) and postdoctoral work (1985) in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard University in the laboratory of Mark Ptashne. In work there he cloned the E. coli LexA repressor and showed how it controlled the cell's response to DNA damage, used LexA as a repressor in yeast, and created fusion proteins that used LexA to bring portions of yeast Gal4 and other transcription regulatory proteins to synthetic reporter genes in yeast. These domain swap experiments established the domain structure of eukaryotic transcription regulatory proteins. Career Brent's use of prokaryotic repressor proteins in eukaryotes, and development of chimeric proteins containing prokaryotic DNA binding domains, enabled identification of other transcription regulatory domains and gene regulatory technologies including tetracycline-repressor controlled transcriptional repression and the Gal4 and LexA UAS systems used in other model organisms. The use of DNA binding domains to target tethered functional protein domains (for example double strand endonucleases and DNA methylases ) or bait moieties in two- hybrid experiments to defined sites on DNA is now routine. In 1985, Brent moved to the Department of Molecular Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School. His work there contributed to two-hybrid methods and to development of large scale/ general purpose functional genomic means (interaction mating and development of peptide aptamers) to detect and disrupt protein-protein interactions. In 1997, with Sydney Brenner he helped establish the Molecular Sciences Institute, a nonprofit research laboratory in Berkeley, California, and became its CEO, research director and president in 2001. He initiated his lab's studies on cell signal control and cell-to-cell variation there. He is now a Full Member of the Division of Basic Sciences at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and an Affiliate Professor of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. Brent's work pursues two main questions: how cell signaling systems control their signals and the information those transmit and the origins and phenotypic consequences of cell-to-cell variation in signaling and subsequent responses. In 1987, Brent help found, and continues to contribute to, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, a \\"how to clone it manual\\" which started the Current Protocols journals. From 1995 to 2000 he organized the \\"After the Genome\\" workshops in Santa Fe, whose content contributed to some of the early systems biology agenda. In addition to customary advisory work with NIH, NSF, and industrial organizations, in 1997 he began to advise the US government on tactical and strategic considerations for defense against biological attack and emerging diseases. In 1998, at the Molecular Sciences Institute, he participated in discussions with Rob Carlson and Drew Endy that helped develop some of the ideas underpinning synthetic biology. From 2011 to 2014 he directed the Center for Biological Futures, an experimental effort to better understand the impacts of advances in biological knowledge and capability on human affairs. He has been a scholar of The Pew Charitable Trusts and a senior scholar of the Ellison Medical Foundation. In 2003 he shared the Gabbay Award in Biotechnology and Medicine for his work on protein interaction methods, and in 2011 he was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science \\"for outstanding contributions in the area of biochemistry, transcription, genomics, and systems biology.\\" Brent's use of prokaryotic repressor proteins and use of them in chimeric proteins to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes was the subject of basic patents (including , Regulation of Eukaryotic Gene Expression, with Mark Ptashne).

He worked as a teacher, and spent part of his time painting landscapes, none of which are known to survive.Winkfield 2014, pp. 180‚Äì181. After military service in World War II, he resumed painting with renewed commitment. In 1946 he began studies with Hans Hofmann. Stout's works of the period 1947‚Äì1952 show the influence of European geometric painting, and typically feature multiple intersecting vertical and horizontal bands of color.Winkfield 2014, p. 182. After about 1950, single forms rather than patterns dominated some of his paintings. In 1952 Stout relocated to Provincetown.Winkfield 2014, p. 181. In the autumn of that year his readings of Greek mythology, especially the tragedies of Sophocles and Aeschylus, inspired a new direction in his art.Winkfield 2014, p. 184.

She was particularly noted for her interpretations of the leading roles in operas by Amilcare Ponchielli whom she married in 1874.  Life and career  Brambilla was born in Cassano d'Adda to a musical family. Her five aunts were all opera singers, three of whom (Marietta, Teresa, and Giuseppina Brambilla) had prominent careers. According to some accounts, she was trained in singing by Marietta and Teresa, and to others, by Giuseppina.Mattera, Angelo (1971). \\"Brambilla, Teresa\\". Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Vol. 13. Treccani. Online version retrieved 1 February 2015 . She made her debut as Adalgisa in Norma in 1863 with the Italian opera company in Odessa where both Giuseppina and Teresa had sung to great success.Forbes, Elizabeth.

On 5 December 1872 she sang the role of Lucia Mondella in the premiere of Amilcare Ponchielli's major revision of his early opera I promessi sposi. The performance inaugurated Milan's Teatro Dal Verme and proved to be Ponchielli's first major success and a breakthrough for him as an opera composer. Ponchielli and Brambilla married in 1874, and she became known as the \\"ideal interpreter\\" of his works, receiving particular acclaim for her performance in the title role of La Gioconda which she first sang at La Scala on 18 April 1876. Brambilla sang in the Rome premieres of Lohengrin (as Elsa) and Poliuto (as Paolina) and was also known for her interpretations of the Verdi heroines, Leonora and Aida. In the carnival season of 1875, she had sung the title role in Aida to great success at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa, conducted by Verdi himself, in a run of 30 consecutive performances. After Ponchielli's death in 1886, she continued to perform until 1889 when she retired from the stage and became a voice teacher at the Geneva Conservatory. She later returned to Italy where she taught at the Pesaro Conservatory until 1911. Brambilla died in Vercelli at the age of 76. She and Ponchielli had three children, two sons and a daughter. Their son Annibale was a music critic and minor composer.Greene, David Mason (1985). Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers, p. 704.

The mountain serves as a host for military, communications, recreational, and residential functions. The underground operations center for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was built during the Cold War to monitor North American airspace for missile launches and Soviet military aircraft. Built deep within granite, it was designed to withstand the impact and fallout from a nuclear bomb. Its function broadened with the end of the Cold War, and then many of its functions were transferred to Peterson Air Force Base in 2006. Homesteading on the mountain began in 1867 and the mountain was the site of resorts and retreats beginning in the 1880s. Spencer Penrose, who built The Broadmoor in 1918, bought many of the properties on the mountain and built the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Cheyenne Mountain Highway, Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun, a lodge on one of the mountain peaks, and a retreat at Emerald Valley. The site of the lodge has become a wilderness Cloud Camp and Emerald Valley is now the site of The Broadmoor's Ranch at Emerald Valley. Land on Cheyenne Mountain that had once been owned by The Broadmoor is now the site of luxury homes. A community, Overlook Colony, that began in 1911 still resides on the mountain. The two parks on and at the base of Cheyenne Mountain are Cheyenne Mountain State Park and North Cheyenne Ca√±on Park. A noticeable feature on the top of one of Cheyenne Mountain's peaks is an antenna farm with transmitters for cellular phone, radio, television, and law enforcement transmitters. Geography Cheyenne Mountain has three peaks. The southern peak is Cheyenne Mountain's summit at in elevation. It was formerly called Mount Albrecht. The antenna farm sits on the middle peak. The northern peak, The Horns, may look to some like the head of a dragon or horns. The peak is in elevation. The mountain's boundaries are Rock Creek, which flows from Mount Big Chief through Cheyenne Mountain to the town of Fountain, to the south and Cheyenne Ca√±on to the north. The western side of Cheyenne Mountain is in Pike National Forest, within the Pikes Peak Ranger District. Colorado Springs' skyline features Cheyenne Mountain and Pikes Peak. Other mountain peaks are Mount Arthur, Mount Baldy, Mount Rosa, Cameron's Cone, and Mount Garfield. History =Early history= Cheyenne Mountain was named for the Cheyenne people. Native Americans found that Cheyenne Mountain was a good source of wood for teepee poles. It was visited by Cheyenne and Arapaho people, who may have sought spiritual inspiration from the mountain's waterfalls. Cheyenne Mountain was used by Ute Native Americans to cross from the plains and benefit from the \\"steep slopes and hidden valleys\\" to safely travel from enemy tribes that had their horses stolen by the Utes. =Late 19th century= William Dixon, a rancher, claimed a homestead in the Cheyenne Mountain foothills in 1867. He built a tavern along a trail up Cheyenne Mountain and turned the trail into a toll road, now called Old Stage Road, to Cripple Creek. The road begins as a paved road and is then a dirt road through Pike National Forest. His homestead ultimately became part of The Broadmoor resort. The Cheyenne Mining District was located on Cheyenne Mountain. The Little Suzie gold mine was built by a group of prospectors in the 1870s. Silver and minerals were mined on Cheyenne Mountain in 1883. Towns or resorts built on Cheyenne Mountain included the original Bruin Inn (1884), Watsonville (town named in 1884) and Wade City, also called Wade's Resort, (1885). The first mining claims granted for El Paso County were for the Manganese and Rio Grande lodes on Cheyenne Mountain by January 31, 1885. File:Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado-LCCN2008676336.jpgCheyenne Mountain, 1898‚Äì1905 =Early 20th century= The Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway (Short Line) traversed Cheyenne Mountain during the trip between Cripple Creek and Colorado Springs by 1905. It transported coal, mined ore, and passengers. Also at that time, a carriage road went to Seven Lakes and the summit of Pikes Peak from Cheyenne Mountain. Grace Lutheran Church built a retreat in Emerald Valley in 1904. It is now The Broadmoor's Ranch at Emerald Valley. In 1905, Dr. August McKay homesteaded on 120 acres on the east slope of Cheyenne Mountain. He developed a series of trails and rest houses that led to The Sunshine Inn that he built as a health resort above Old Stage Road. The property was purchased by Spencer Penrose, who had the inn torn down. The Overlook Colony was started in 1911 by a group of Colorado College professors. It first started as a summer retreat for the educators, and grew to include musicians, doctors, artists, generals, oilmen, and an ambassador to India. The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo was built just below and the Will Rogers Shrine built just above this community. Residents manage the Overlook Colony Mutual Water Company that governs water conservation, maintenance, and testing of the water supply from deep within the former Little Susie gold mine. Bert Swisher and Thomas Dixon homesteaded on Cheyenne Mountain in 1917. Dixon resided with his family in a cabin near the top of the mountain in the middle of three valleys. Swisher's cabin was near the present site of the antenna farm at the top of the mountain, which was accessed by Old Stage Road. =Spencer Penrose and The Broadmoor= Cheyenne Mountain became a successful recreational and resort area when Spencer Penrose developed The Broadmoor resort in 1918. The Cheyenne Mountain Cog Railroad provided narrow gauge cog railway service to South Cheyenne Ca√±on from the Broadmoor Casino beginning in 1918. It later offered service from The Broadmoor to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Service ended in 1974. In the 1920s, Penrose began to develop on Cheyenne Mountain property on the northern peak that he bought in 1915. He built the Cheyenne Mountain Highway in 1925. In 1926, the Cheyenne Mountain Lodge opened at the top of Cheyenne Mountain. It had a restaurant, a suite for Penrose on the third floor, four guest rooms, and living quarters for servants. Visitors could make the trip up the Cheyenne Mountain Highway on the backs of elephants. The lodge closed in 1961. It was razed in 1976 following years of destruction by vandals. It is now the site of The Broadmoor's Cloud Camp lodge and cabins. File:Broadmoor lake panorama to west.jpgThe Broadmoor resort, with Cheyenne Lake in the foreground and Cheyenne Mountain in the left half of the background Penrose developed the country's highest zoo at in elevation, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (1926) on the mountain and Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun (1937) on the northern promontory of the mountain. The Cheyenne Mountain Highway was built for transport to the zoo, shrine, and top of the mountain. The Broadmoor built a ski area on Cheyenne Mountain in 1959. In 1986, the resort closed Ski Broadmoor, but the city of Colorado Springs and Ski Vail stepped in to keep it open. It closed in 1991. The land was sold to the Broadmoor Resort Community Association. Land that had once been owned by The Broadmoor on the mountain was sold and is now the site of luxury homes.

The center, deep within Cheyenne Mountain, was completed in 1966 after spending $142 million and using 500 tons of explosives. The result was an underground city operated by the Air Force. Popular Science wrote in 1965, before the dedication of the facility, that Cheyenne Mountain is the only mountain known to have buildings constructed on the inside of a mountain. It was built to withstand being bombed: eleven multiple-story buildings stand on coil springs to absorb the shock of a blast and it was designed so that up to 800 people could survive fall-out of a nuclear bomb. The buildings are encased in steel, surrounded by granite, and the facility is behind blast-proof doors. It was designed to be the \\"nerve center\\" for NORAD. The NORAD center has been staffed by Canadian and United States military personnel to monitor North American air space for intercontinental ballistic missiles and incoming Soviet military aircraft. Locally, this military boom during the Cold War included the establishment of the United States Air Force Academy, Peterson Air Force Base, and Fort Carson. After the Cold War, NORAD monitored objects orbiting the earth and aircraft without flight plans. It is also known for monitoring the Christmas Eve orbit of Santa Claus. NORAD used to offer public tours, but due to security concerns they were suspended in 1999. The off-ramp on NORAD road has been staffed by Air Force Security Police since September 11, 2001. Most of the center's operations were moved to Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs in 2006, then in April 2015, the Pentagon reported that a few operations would be moving back in.

Edmonds, John Browne, and Buck Ingersoll agreed to replace the trails to the area with a real road, which was opened in 1960 by the Cheyenne Propagation Company. There are 700 cell phone, television, radio, and law enforcement transmitters on the antenna farm. The Cheyenne Mountain radio site 145.160 repeater covers south central and southeast Colorado along the Interstate 25 corridor from Monument nearly to the New Mexico border. In 2002, it was operated by the Cheyenne Propagation Company. Parks and recreation =Cheyenne Mountain State Park= The City of Colorado Springs and Colorado State Parks purchased 1,680 acres of land to preserve the \\"southeastern flank\\" of the mountain and its wildlife habitat in 2000. The land, originally the JL Ranch, was slated for development of 2,500 houses. The land was purchased to create the Cheyenne Mountain State Park, which is the only state park in El Paso County. An additional 1,021 acres at the top and east side of Cheyenne Mountain were acquired from 2007 to 2009. The park is now a total of 2,701 acres, part of which is at the base of the mountain and part of which is on Cheyenne Mountain. It has 20 miles of trails. =Cheyenne Ca√±on= The 1,600 acre North Cheyenne Ca√±on Park, Starsmore Discovery Center, Seven Falls, and some of Colorado Spring's \\"most exclusive neighborhoods\\" are located in Cheyenne Ca√±on. The source of North Cheyenne Creek is in Teller County. South Cheyenne Creek's source, also in Teller County, is Mount Big Chief, near St. Peter's Dome. The flows through Seven Falls in South Cheyenne Ca√±on. North Cheyenne Ca√±on Park was started when the city of Colorado Springs bought 640 acres in North Cheyenne Ca√±on from Colorado College in 1885. An additional 480 acres was donated by General William Jackson Palmer. That land included High Drive, Silver Cascade Falls, and Helen Hunt Falls. In 1909 the Park Commission called it \\"by far the grandest and most popular of all the beautiful ca√±ons near the city\\" for its evergreen trees, waterfalls, Cheyenne Creek, and rock formations. Moderate hikes in the canon include Mount Cutler and Columbine trails. The two creeks meet and form Cheyenne Creek near the intersection of North Cheyenne Canyon Road, South Cheyenne Canyon Road, and Cheyenne Boulevard.

Military career On 5 July 1984, Padrino graduated from Military Academy of Venezuela. He commanded mortar personnel of the Antonio Ricaurte Infantry Battalion in Rubio, T√°chira State. Between February and May 1995, Padrino was sent to the School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia for a \\"Psychological Operations\\" and \\"Advanced Officer training\\" course by the US Army. During the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt, he was a colonel of the Simon Bolivar Infantry Battalion in Fuerte Tiuna, remaining loyal to the government of Hugo Ch√°vez. He was later appointed Chief of Joint Staff of the Strategic Defense Central Region Integral by President Chavez. In 2013, Padrino became the commander in chief of the Venezuelan Armed forces. On 24 October 2014, Padrino was named by President Nicolas Maduro to be the successor of Carmen Melendez as the Minister of Defense. Currently Padrino and the Minister of People's Power for Defense hold the positions of Strategic Operational commander of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces. =Increased authority= On 12 July 2016, President Nicol√°s Maduro granted Padrino the powers to distribute food and medicine, authority over all Bolivarian missions, while also having his military command five of Venezuela's main ports, with Maduro stating: > All ministries and government institutions are subordinated to the National > Command of the Great Mission for Safe Sovereign and Safe Supply, which is > under the command of the President and of the top General, Vladimir Padrino > L√≥pez. This action performed by President Maduro made General Padrino one of the most powerful people in Venezuela, possibly \\"the second most powerful man in Venezuelan politics\\". The appointment of Padrino was also seen to be similar to the Cuban government's tactic of granting the Cuban military the power to manage Cuba's economy. Written work Padrino is the author of the manual Preparation Process Operations, which is used as query and serves as a reference in all institutes, schools and universities and vocational training of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces.

The activists of Awami League who were rallying in the streets of Chittagong that day were attacked by the police during the regime of autocratic ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad. The then Chittagong Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mirza Rakibul Huda ordered the police to open fire on the rally that left at least 24 people dead. The official statement from the government estimated that nine people were killed that day. On the other hand, Sheikh Hasina the chief of Bangladesh Awami League claimed that 33 of its activists were shot dead in that massacre. Background Hussain Muhammad Ershad, the Chief of Staff of Bangladesh Army in 1982, forced Justice Abdus Sattar, the elected President of People's Republic of Bangladesh in 1982, to resign from his office on March 24 of 1982. Ershad took over the power as the Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh and suspended the constitution that day. He turned the de facto ruler of Bangladesh. Hussain Muhammad Ershad held an election on May 7 of 1986. Initially Bangladesh Awami League declared the election as an illegal one and Ershad an autocratic ruler. In her March 17 rally of 1986 at Laldighi of Chittagong, Sheikh Hasina said: But eventually Bangladesh Awami League participated in the election of May 7 and lost to Ershad's Bangladesh Jatiya Party. Sheikh Hasina managed to win in three constituencies. Later on October 15 of the same year Ershad was elected as the President of Bangladesh through a manipulated election. Enraged Bangladesh Awami League later on August 29, 1987, refused to hold any talk with Ershad and locked itself in several clashes with the government. On November 10 of 1987, the police in Dhaka opened fire on the opposition activists that left Bangladesh Awami League activist Nur Hossain dead. The incident added fuel in the fire and compelled Ershad to suspend the parliament on December 6, 1987. Ershad in 1988 declared to hold an election on March 4 to legitimize his rule. Bangladesh Nationalist Party led Seven Party Alliance, Awami League led Eight Party Alliance and the leftist Five Party Alliance who were on the streets against the autocratic rule of Ershad decided to boycott the election and were holding frequent rallies to foil the election. Events On January 24 of 1988, Sheikh Hasina with a couple of Awami League bigwigs arrived the second largest city of Bangladesh, Chittagong in morning. Later she spoke in a public gathering organized by Chittagong metropolitan Awami League at Laldighi of the city in front of a large crowd. After the meeting Sheikh Hasina in a truck, was leading a procession in the streets of Chittagong. Her rally was interrupted in front of Kotwali intersection of the city. Police barricaded the road in front of Kotwali Police Station. When the crowd tried to remove the barricade and move ahead, the Chittagong Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mirza Rakibul Huda ordered his force to open fire upon the crowd instantly. The indiscriminate firing of police took the life of at least 24 people that day. Hundreds of people were injured. Sheikh Hasina escaped the attack as a number of activists surrounded her and formed a human wall around her. Amid repeated request from Sheikh Hasina to stop firing, police did not pay any heed. The purview of the massacre were around Muslim Institute, KC Dey Road, Nandakanan, Amtola and Court Building area. Inspector Govinda Chandra Mandal, Constable Pradeep Barua, Constable Momtazuddin, Constable Mostafizur Rahman, Constable Shah Abdullah, Constable Bashir Ahmed, Constable Abdus Salam are among others who took part and led the massacre. Aftermath Almost five years of the massacre Shahidul Huda, a lawyer, filed a murder case against 46 perpetrators including the Chittagong Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mirza Rakibul Huda in 1992. In 1996, CID of Police were given the charge to investigate the case. CID submitted a charge sheet on 12 December 1997. A complementary charge sheet was filed on December 3 of 1998. On May 9 of 2000, the court framed charge against eight of the 46 suspects. All of them were police. Among the convicts, Inspector Govinda Chandra Mandal remained absconding since the case was filed. Other convicts were released on bail in 2003. Constable Bashir Ahmed and Constable Abdus Salam died natural death. The families who lost their beloved in this massacre were denied justice till date.

The eyes have been seen on \\"billboards, T-shirts and buildings around the nation\\".  Background  Members of the Venezuelan armed forces carrying \\"Ch√°vez eyes\\" flags saying, \\"Chavez lives, the fight continues\\". \\"Ch√°vez eyes\\" first originated from Hugo Ch√°vez's final presidential campaign in 2012, with the idea originating from Jos√© Miguel Espa√±a, a member of Ch√°vez's campaign. During an election gathering, thousands of Ch√°vez supporters wore red shirts printed with his eyes in black. The design was then widely spread by Ch√°vez supporters. Following Ch√°vez's death, Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro adopted the emblem after coming to power, placing the eyes on \\"billboards, walls, and even the facades of public buildings\\". By 2015, Reuters described the \\"Ch√°vez eyes\\" as \\"[t]he most ubiquitous image in Venezuela of recent years\\". Uses =Elections= Mural supporting the Mayor of San Juan During the 2013 Venezuelan presidential elections, Maduro used the \\"Ch√°vez eyes\\" design for his campaign. Ch√°vez's image was used more than Maduro's own image, with \\"Ch√°vez eyes\\" seen on buildings, T-shirts and posters. The eyes have also been used by various Venezuelan politicians that support Chavez or claim to continue his work. =State-owned facilities= In each new housing project built by the Venezuelan government, housing millions of Venezuelans in total, the emblematic eyes are also positioned throughout the complexes. Following the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election, which installed an opposition majority in the National Assembly, the parliamentary body decided to have the Ch√°vez eyes removed from the Federal Legislative Palace. Following the National Assembly's move, the Venezuelan government asked for muralists \\"to paint against censorship\\", with murals beginning to flood throughout Caracas. =Use by popular figures= At a Ch√°vez tribute in November 2014, Pablo Iglesias Turri√≥n, leader of the Spanish political party Podemos, was seen wearing a red shirt with the \\"eyes of Ch√°vez\\" printed on it. Analysis Fidel Vasquez reading from a folder bearing \\"Ch√°vez eyes\\" during a 2017 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela session. According to a 2014 report titled Faces and Traces of a Leader. Hugo Chavez: Memory of a People by the Venezuelan government's National Center for History, the Ch√°vez eyes are supposed to represent a \\"watchful and protective gaze\\" and present a feeling of transparency or trust related to the phrase \\"Look into my eyes when I'm talking\\". It was also noted that since Ch√°vez was not physically present in Venezuela anymore, the Ch√°vez eyes to Bolivarian government supporters represented an \\"omnipresent\\" Ch√°vez, reminding voters of their \\"ideological commitment\\". Some who experienced the work say that it instills a presence of Ch√°vez, a sense that he is \\"always watching you\\" that has been compared to the Orwellian figure, Big Brother.

These standard conditions vary according to different regulatory bodies. One example of standard conditions for the calculation of SCCM is T_n = 0 ¬∞C (273.15 K) and p_n = 1.01 bar (14.72 psia). SCCM is a measure of mass flow rate, \\\\dot m , and in spite of its name it must not be confused with a measure of volumetric flow rate, \\\\dot q . One SCCM indicates the mass flow rate of one cubic centimeter per minute of a fluid, typically a gas, at a density defined at some standard temperature, T_n , and pressure, p_n . To convert one SCCM to the measure of mass flow rate in the SI system, kg/s, one relies in the fundamental relationship between mass flow rate and volumetric flow rate (see volumetric flow rate) , : \\\\dot m = \\\\rho_n \\\\dot q , where \\\\rho_n is density at some standard conditions, and an equation of state such as : \\\\rho_n = \\\\frac{p_n M}{Z_n R_u T_n } , with M being the fluid molecular weight, Z_n the fluid compressibility factor, and R_u the universal gas constant. By including units of measurement and their conversion between square brackets in the above relationship between \\\\dot m and \\\\dot q one obtains : \\\\dot m \\\\left[\\\\frac{kg}{s} \\\\right] = \\\\rho_n \\\\left[\\\\frac{kg}{m^3} \\\\right] \\\\dot q \\\\left[\\\\frac{cm^3}{min} \\\\frac{1 \\\\, min}{60 \\\\, s} \\\\frac{1 m^3}{10^6 \\\\, cm^3} \\\\right] , where \\\\dot m is in kg/s , \\\\rho_n in kg/m^3 , and \\\\dot q is in cm^3/min . Thereafter, by replacing \\\\rho_n with the above equation of state one obtains : \\\\dot m \\\\left[\\\\frac{kg}{s}\\\\right] = \\\\frac{p_n [Pa] M \\\\left[ \\\\frac{kg}{kmol}\\\\right]}{Z_n R_u \\\\left[\\\\frac{J}{K kmol}\\\\right] T_n [K]} \\\\dot q \\\\left[\\\\frac{cm^3}{min} \\\\frac{1 \\\\, min}{60 \\\\, s} \\\\frac{1 m^3}{10^6 \\\\, cm^3}\\\\right] , where again units are kept inside square brackets. Using this last relationship, one can convert a mass flow rate in the more familiar unit of kg/s to SCCM and vice versa with : 1 \\\\, \\\\frac{kg}{s} = 6E7 \\\\frac{Z_n R_u \\\\left[\\\\frac{J}{K kmol}\\\\right] T_n [K]}{p_n [Pa] M \\\\left[ \\\\frac{kg}{kmol}\\\\right] } SCCM , and : 1 \\\\, SCCM = 1.6667E-8 \\\\frac{p_n [Pa] M \\\\left[ \\\\frac{kg}{kmol}\\\\right] }{Z_n R_u \\\\left[\\\\frac{J}{K kmol}\\\\right] T_n [K]} \\\\frac{kg}{s} . With this conversion from SCCM to kg/s, one can then use available unit calculators to convert kg/s to other units, such as g/s of the CGS system, or slug/s. To provide some usage examples, consider the conversion of 1 SCCM of nitrogen, which has a molecular weight of 28 kg/kmol, to kg/s. Consider standard conditions of 101325 Pa and 273.15 K, and assume the gas is an ideal gas (i.e., Z_n=1 ). Using the unity bracket method (see conversion of units) one then obtains: : 1 \\\\, {\\\\cancel \\\\text{SCCM}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{ 1.6667E-8 \\\\frac{101325 [Pa] 28 \\\\left[ \\\\frac{kg}{kmol}\\\\right] }{8314 \\\\left[\\\\frac{J}{K kmol}\\\\right] 273.15 [K]} \\\\frac{kg}{s} } { 1 \\\\, {\\\\cancel \\\\text{SCCM}} } = 2.08E-8 \\\\frac{kg}{s} . To convert 50 SCCM of nitrogen with the above considerations one does : 50 \\\\, {\\\\cancel \\\\text{SCCM}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{ 1.6667E-8 \\\\frac{101325 [Pa] 28 \\\\left[ \\\\frac{kg}{kmol}\\\\right] }{8314 \\\\left[\\\\frac{J}{K kmol}\\\\right] 273.15 [K]} \\\\frac{kg}{s} } { 1 \\\\, {\\\\cancel \\\\text{SCCM}} } = 1.04E-6 \\\\frac{kg}{s} . As another example, to do the same for 1 SCCM of helium, which has a molecular weight of 4 kg/kmol, one obtains: : 1 \\\\, {\\\\cancel \\\\text{SCCM}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{ 1.6667E-8 \\\\frac{101325 [Pa] 4 \\\\left[ \\\\frac{kg}{kmol}\\\\right] }{8314 \\\\left[\\\\frac{J}{K kmol}\\\\right] 273.15 [K]} \\\\frac{kg}{s} } { 1 \\\\, {\\\\cancel \\\\text{SCCM}} } = 2.97E-9 \\\\frac{kg}{s} , where note that 1 SCCM of helium is much less in kg/s than one SCCM of nitrogen. Notice from these examples that, unlike measures such as kg/s or g/s, the SCCM is a mass flow rate measure that depends both on the type of fluid (e.g., nitrogen or helium in the above examples) and the standard conditions used. A unit related to the SCCM is the SLM or SLPM which stands for Standard litre per minute. Their conversion is : 1 \\\\, SCCM = 1E-3 \\\\, SLM , and : 1 \\\\, SLM = 1E3 \\\\, SCCM . Another unit is the SCFM which stands for Standard cubic feet per minute. Yet another unit related to SCCM (and SLM) is the PCCM (and PLM) which stands for Perfect Cubic Centimeter per Minute (Perfect Litre per Minute). One PCCM is one SCCM when the gas is ideal. In other words, one PCCM is exactly the same as one SCCM if and only if Z_n =1 in the above relationships.

Wisden declared that he \\"batted with calm assurance\\" and held out \\"promise of playing Test cricket in the future\\".Wisden 1980, p. 982. He was selected for an Indian Board President's XI against the West Indians later in the season, and also against the Pakistan touring team early the next season, the latter was ruined by rain and he did not bat. He also played Duleep Trophy matches for South Zone in 1979-80. His innings of note in 1979-80 was 136 not out in seven hours, batting for Hyderabad against Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy, the only century in a drawn match. After two matches in 1980-81 he contracted an illness which led to a long period of hospitalisation.

He then retired from cricket at the age of 23. Conservation career Saad and his wife Sangeeta now run the Royal Migration Camps in the Serengeti in Tanzania and own eco-resorts on the banks of the Kabini River in Karnataka. They started their conservation career at Bandipur National Park in Karnataka in 1992 where they still run The Bandipur Cottage. The Jungs owned a wildlife lodge in Bandipur which Sangeeta decided to convert into an eco-resort. As Bandipur turned commercial, the Jungs purchased a piece of land near the Kabini backwaters in 1993. Today their son Shaaz Jung runs the eco-tourism resort with African-style tents and local cuisine. They aim to reconcile the needs of the local people with the needs of conservation through a sustained process of dialogue and trust building utilizing eco-tourism as the integral tool for conservation. They have also been taking safari tours to Africa since 1995. Saad has written three books, all with conservation themes: Wild Tales from the Wild, about the people and wildlife of the Mangala valley in Karnataka; Subhan and I: My Adventure with the Angling Legend of India, about angling for mahseer in the Cauvery River; and a novel, Matabele Dawn, a thriller set in Africa and India. Saad and his wife have their business in Tanzania and live in their home near Bandipur and often come to Indiranagar, an eastern suburb of Bangalore.

He was born in Czechoslovakia in 1935 to Jewish farmers and lived with his family on their farm until he was the age of eight. At this age laws started coming in that prohibited the movement and rights of Jewish people and that is when he and his family went into hiding. Unfortunately he, his mother, his brother and his grandmother were caught and taken to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1944 where they stayed until the camp was liberated by the British in 1945. More than 30 members of his family were killed during the Holocaust. He moved to Ireland in 1959 but did not speak about his experiences for half a century. Tomi is known for his talks about his experience of The Holocaust as a child. He is one of three Holocaust survivors currently residing in Ireland. He gives talks in secondary schools, colleges and at various other events across the country and his aim is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust so that we can remember the people who died in it and so it never happens again: \\"After all the horror, I am doing my best to keep the memory of those lost ones alive. We - you, me, your children, my children - must never forget.\\" In 2007 Tomi was approached by Gerry Gregg, Seamus Deasy, and Oliver Donohoe about making a film about Tomi and his experiences in Bergen-Belsen. Tomi agreed and in late 2007 they traveled to Germany to film Tomi talking about his experiences of the concentration camp, while standing where it once stood. In the documentary Close to Evil Tomi tried to interview Hilde Michnia, but she declined to meet him, though she appeared in the documentary. This led to Hans-J√ºrgen Brennecke, a Hamburg prosecutor, filing charges against her as she was suspected of forcing prisoners on an evacuation march in which 1400 women died. Tomi wanted to meet her and hoped that she had atoned, but his disappointment was that she was stuck in the 1940s and had denied the murder of inmates in Bergen-Belsen. In 2011, Tomi Reichental's book I Was a Boy in Belsen was first published by O'Brien Press Ltd. In this autobiography, Reichental recounts his experiences as a child prisoner in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He has received many awards for his work and tireless efforts to promote tolerance and to educate young people about the importance of remembrance and reconciliation and it has made him one of the most inspirational figures in modern Ireland. In 2015, Trinity College Dublin awarded him with an honorary doctorate. He was conferred an honorary doctorate by Dublin City University in March 2016, citing his recent advocacy: \\"In the past number of years Tomi Reichental has proven to be one of the most inspirational figures in modern Ireland. His effort to ensure that the important themes of remembrance, forgiveness, conflict resolution and reconciliation remain to the forefront of modern Irish thought is truly important. In an age where we see horrific pictures of refugees attempting to flee appalling regimes to find sanctuary in the West, Tomi Reichental is a vivid example of the positive impact refugees make to modern Irish society. Honouring Tomi Reichental with the highest honour that Dublin City University can bestow is a fitting tribute to Tomi and his work. It also expresses this University's commitment to multiculturalism and inclusion and showcases our solidarity with the plight of refugees today, who seek a better life, as Tomi and his family did over fifty years ago.\\".https://www.dcu.ie/news/2016/apr/s0416c.shtml In 2019 the Bar Council of Ireland awarded Tomi a Human Rights Award in recognition of his work promoting tolerance, remembrance and reconciliation.

He revealed that the idea had come to him in the early 2000s and Vijayakanth's unavailability had meant the film only materialised after a delay. Prashanth underwent strength training for the venture, while beauty pageant winner Medha Raghunathan was briefly signed on to play the lead female role, before opting out. The film progressed slowly, also a result of Prashanth's marital problems, and reports in May 2007 suggested that Ibrahim Rowther was unhappy with the film's content and felt the film lacked a proper storyline unlike the previous version.

Selvamani subsequently appealed and compromised by agreeing to remove controversial dialogues and a sequence which involved an actress depicting Indian tennis player Sania Mirza. The producer subsequently accepted an \\"A\\" certificate for the film, with the soundtrack releasing the following week. The team also revealed that the film would be released the following month, though this proved to be untrue. Prashanth indicated that the film was delayed due to producer's financial problems. In January 2015, Selvamani announced that the film will be released on 30 January. The film was released on 30 January 2015 after a long delay. The film received mixed reviews. Times of India wrote: \\"The visuals lack sheen, the editing is jerky and at times disorienting, actors' voices change perceptibly in the same scene with someone else dubbing over the lines which include facts and figures, and there is an unmistakable late 80s ethos in the filmmaking\\".

He was also the former chairman of Delta State Council of Traditional Rulers. He ruled the traditional kingdom of Agbon for 54 years and clinched the title of the longest reigning monarch in Delta State.  Early life  Chamberlain Oyibocha Orovwuje is a scion of the Orovwuje dynasty of Okpara Inland. His Royal moniker was Ogurime- Rime, Okpara 1. He was the first King (Ovie) of Agbon Kingdom (The Agbon Kingdom is made up of sub clans of Okpara, Kokori, Eku, Orhuakpor, Ovu, and Igun) in Ethiope East Local Government of Delta State. He joined his ancestors in June 2012, aged 77 years. He ascended the throne in 1958 from the famous Saint Thomas College, Ibusa at the age of 23 years as the King of Agbon. As a young king in the 1950s, he was under the tutelage of M. G. Ejaife, the first Urhobo university graduate, Chief Otite Ijedia, Chief E.B. Eshalomi and Chief T.E.A. Salubi. He acquired the wisdom of leadership from these great men.  Leadership  His leadership traits were seen beyond the traditional- political institution through his appointment to Government establishments as a Board member of the Nigerian Coal Corporation, Enugu, Eastern Nigeria and the Chairman of the Bendel Hospitals Management Board by Brigadier Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia. He also served as a non-Executive Director for many years with the defunct Bendel Glass Company Limited in Ughelli, Nigeria. It is instructive to note that the late Ovie was exposed early in life to political and parliamentary governance with his appointment as a member of the Western Regional House of Chiefs and by extension with the creation of the Mid ‚Äì West region, he served as a pioneer member of the Mid- Western House of Chiefs. What is more, at the larger community level, he was the Chairman Ukoko r Ivie r urhobo (Committee of Urhobo Kings) and a member of the Traditional Rulers of Oil Mineral Producing Communities of Nigeria (TROMPCON) and also Chairman Delta State Traditional Rulers Council. His contribution to the western Urhobo council, through his constant dialogue with residents, is also note worthy, particularly in the area of rural electrification. It is on good account that the Ovie influence on the Bendel Rural Electrification to his kingdom was positive and he was also instrumental to the citing of the local government at Isiokolo.

Originally introduced in 1989, the Mk3 represented the biggest change to the Fiesta since the original car was introduced in 1976. In addition to the 3-door hatchback and panel van versions that had formed the Fiesta range, a 5-door hatchback was also added. The Fiesta Mk3 was replaced by the Fiesta Mk4 in 1995, but remained on sale until early 1997. The Mk4 was a major restyle of the Mk3, but had the same chassis. The Fiesta Mk3 also spawned a high-cube panel van version in 1991, the Courier, and also shared its platform with the Ka of 1996, which was derived from the Fiesta Mk4. History The third generation Fiesta, codenamed BE-13 was unveiled at the end of 1988 and officially went on sale in February of the following year with UK sales commencing in April. The car was based on a new platform ditching the old car's rear beam axle for a semi-independent torsion beam arrangement and looked radically different, addressing the principal weakness of the previous generation ‚Äì the lack of a 5-door derivative, something that was by then available in its major rivals such as the Fiat Uno, Peugeot 205 and Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova. The other main change was to the running gear ‚Äì the improved HCS (High Compression Swirl) version of the Kent/Valencia powerplant. The CVH units from the second generation were carried over largely unmodified. The LT diesel engine was enlarged to a 1.8L capacity. This model had the longest production life of any Fiesta to date, achieved the highest yearly sales of any Fiesta in the early 1990s ‚Äì achieving a sales volume of 1 million units inside the first two years of production. A Fiesta-derived van, the Courier, was launched in 1991. In the British market, Fuel injected engines only became available in 1991. They had been sold in countries with more stringent emissions controls since the introduction. In 1992 a number of prototype cars were produced by Ford fitted with direct injection two stroke engines produced by the Orbital Engine Corporation of Australia, with full- scale production anticipated by Ford in \\"two to three years time\\". The cars were tested extensively in the UK, but ultimately it was decided not to go ahead with production versions. Major changes were introduced to the range in 1993; major structural improvements were made to improve safety, as well as a new immobiliser being fitted to petrol models. Revised door mirrors were also fitted, as were a line-up of fresh wheel trim designs. As for sports models, the XR2i was launched in 1989 with an eight-valve CVH engine with . This was then replaced by a Zetec 16 valve version in 1992, which also saw the RS Turbo being supplanted by the RS1800 as the CVH engine was being phased out. The RS1800 shared its engine with the version of the then-current Escort XR3i and had a top speed of . The XR2i name was dropped in early 1994, and the insurance-friendly \\"Si\\" badge appeared in its place on a slightly less sporty- looking model with either the 1.4 L CVH-PTE (a development of the CVH) or the 1.6 L Zetec engine. From 1995 the vehicle was built and sold at the same time as the new Mark 4. To distinguish the car, trim levels were revised, and it was marketed as the \\"Fiesta Classic\\", with a small range consisting of Classic, Classic Quartz, and Classic Cabaret models, and a ‚ÄòSpecial Edition‚Äô Frascati model. This version continued until production finally ceased in early 1997. =Commercial models= As with the Mark 2, this generation was available as a panelled van in many markets. This range offered a limited number of engines. From late September 1990 the van was also available with the new catalyzed central injection (CFi) 1.4-liter petrol engine. A box van version of the Fiesta appeared in the summer of 1991, but was sold as the Ford Courier. =RS Turbo= The Fiesta RS Turbo was a performance model of the Fiesta Mk3. It was introduced in April 1990 and production continued until 1992. Based on the XR2i, introduced a year earlier, it was visually similar. The main differences were 14\\" alloy wheels (an inch larger and of a different design than those fitted to the XR2i) with 185/55 VR14 Pirelli P600 tyres, green rather than blue stripe mouldings, colour-coded rear spoiler and door pillars, opening rear quarter windows, green tinted glass and RS bonnet louvres. Anti-lock brakes and a \\"Quickclear\\" heated front windscreen were options at extra cost. Inside the car the differences included Recaro seats trimmed in \\"Ascot In Raven\\" material and a grey leather trimmed gear knob and a three-spoke steering wheel (as opposed to the two-spoke used in the XR2i), which also had the RS Turbo logo embossed on the centre cap. The RS Turbo's CVH engine retained the same 1597cc capacity as the XR2i, but had a lower compression ratio of 8:1. The Garrett T2 turbocharger supplied of boost and was chosen as space between the engine and radiator prevented the use of the larger T3 from the Escort RS Turbo. As with the Escort, an air-to-air intercooler was fitted, although this was slightly larger on the Fiesta. The quoted power output was 133ps at 5500rpm, with 183 nm of torque at 2400rpm which gave the car a top speed of 133 mph and a 0-60 of 7.9 seconds. The car was not generally well received with reviews citing poor handling and uncommunicative steering as its weak points. The spiralling insurance premiums brought on by the British joyriding epidemic of the early 1990s did not help either, with the car being a popular target for thieves. = RS1800 = The Fiesta RS1800 was introduced as the replacement for the RS Turbo in 1992. The turbocharged 1.6 L CVH engine from the RS Turbo was replaced by a 1.8 L version of the Zetec engine, and had a similar claimed maximum power output of , =Specifications= File:1989 Ford Fiesta 1.1 L (13173099723) (cropped).jpgFiesta Mk3 5-door front (pre-facelift) File:Ford Fiesta 91 HPIM0593.JPGFiesta Mk3 3-door (pre-facelift) File:Ford Fiesta MK3 rear 20070926.jpgFiesta Mk3 5-door (post-facelift) File:1991 Ford Fiesta RS Turbo 1.6 Front.jpgFiesta RS Turbo File:1991 Ford Fiesta RS Turbo 1.6 Rear.jpgFiesta RS Turbo File:1993 Ford Fiesta Popular Van (14594976631).jpgFiesta Mk3 van File:Ford Fiesta 91 HPIM0599.JPGInterior References 3rd Category:Cars introduced in 1989 Category:1990s cars Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Hatchbacks Category:Vans Category:Subcompact cars ","title":"Ford Fiesta (third generation)"},{"id":"45273263","text":"The Fickle (Persian title: Bolhavass- ) is a 1934 Iranian romance drama film directed by Ebrahim Moradi and starring Mohammad Ali Ghotbi, Ahmad Dehghan, Ahmad Gorji , Qodsi Partowi and Touran Veisi.ÿ®ŸàÿßŸÑŸáŸàÿ≥ sourehcinema.com (Persian language) References Category:1934 films Category:Iranian films Category:1934 romantic drama films Category:Persian-language films Category:Iranian black-and-white films Category:Iranian romantic drama films Category:1934 drama films ","title":"The Fickle"},{"id":"45273266","text":"Lychrosimorphus vittatus is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, and the only species in the genus Lychrosimorphus.

Schneider is the current chairman of the Illinois Republican Party and a former member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners representing the 15th district, which includes all or parts of Arlington Heights, Barrington, Barrington Hills, Bartlett, Elgin, Elk Grove Village, Hanover Park, Hoffman Estates, Inverness, Mount Prospect, Rolling Meadows, Roselle, Schaumburg, South Barrington and Streamwood. Education and personal life Schneider graduated from the University of Illinois with a Bachelor of Science degree. Schneider serves as general partner/owner of The Golf Club of Illinois in Algonquin, and Waterwerks Car Wash in Elgin, Illinois. Political career =Cook County Board of Commissioners= Commissioner from the 15th District of Cook County, Illinois Schneider is currently serving his third term on the Cook County Board of Commissioners. Upon election he quickly established himself as a strong advocate for the taxpayers of Cook County. The Chicago Tribune called Schneider \\"a strong and absolutely unwavering voice for streamlining county government\\" and \\"an extraordinary member of a Board that could use many more like him.\\" According to his constituency site, during his first term as commissioner, Schneider lead the fight to repeal President Todd Stroger's sales tax increase. Schneider authored legislation that reduced campaign contribution limits for companies doing business with Cook County in half. As Chairman of the Finance Subcommittee on Workers Compensation, Schneider championed legislation that combats workers compensation fraud by requiring injured employees to submit to recorded interviews detailing each workplace accident. In 2015, Schneider sponsored a resolution opposing a property tax increase to fill the 2016 budget gap. The resolution was prevented from coming to a vote by political maneuvering at the April 1, 2015 Cook County Board meeting. In the November 2018 election, Schneider was defeated in his re-election bid by Democrat Kevin B. Morrison. Forest Preserve District of Cook County As a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, Schneider also served as a commissioner for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County. The Forest Preserves encompass approximately 68,000 acres (275 km¬≤) of open space throughout the county. It contains facilities for recreation and camping, as well as a zoo and a botanic garden. In 2009, the Cook County Forest Preserve District purchased land owned by Schneider's family for over $10 million. Schneider was called out by many board members, even ones in his own party, for violating ethics. =Illinois Republican Party= In 2013, Schneider expressed interest in running for Chairman of the Republican Party of Illinois, but pulled out before the vote. In 2014, Illinois Republican Party Chairman Jack Dorgan decided to resign as chairman so he could join Bruce Rauner's campaign for governor. Both Dorgan and Rauner threw their support behind Schneider to be the next state chairman. Schneider was elected Chairman of the Illinois Republican Party on May 17, 2014 with little opposition. When beginning his tenure as party chairman, Schneider said that uniting the Republican Party of Illinois, which had been divided geographically and ideologically, as a top goal. =Other public offices= Prior to serving on the Cook County Board of Commissioners, Schneider served as Hanover Township Trustee from 1984 to 1997. Additionally, Schneider served as Hanover Township Highway Commissioner from 1997-2006.

After a simple introduction in octaves, there is a long section, featuring a winding melody over a pedal note of F which gives a sense of anticipation; eventually this gives way to a more animated section.

She wrote many books and numerous popular articles in periodicals on the lives of many wild animals by observations in the wild and in the process of raising and nursing injured animals. She lived at \\"The Albynes\\", Shropshire, three miles south of Bridgnorth from 1903 until 1958 when she moved to Castle House, Harley near Much Wenlock.  Biography  Frances Pitt was born at Oldbury Grange, Shropshire before the family moved to Westwood in 1892. Her father William James Pitt, was the son of the vicar of the Parish of Malmesbury, Wiltshire. She learnt to read and write from her mother and was tutored by a Mr Carter and a governess.Pitt (1961):34 Some of her early influences were the books by Ernest Thompson Seton. Her early books were based on experience in taking care of wild animals and these included Tommy White-Tag, the fox (1912) followed by more personal titles in a series called \\"The Library Of Animal Friends\\" which included Tom, my peacock; Moses, my otter (1927) and Katie, my roving cat (1930). In Diana, My Badger published in 1929, she described her experience in raising a pair of baby badgers brought to her by a rabbit catcher. Of the pair, Diana and Jemima, Diana lived to return to the wild. In the early 1920s she wrote on the genetics and inheritance of colour patterning in Hereford cattle and on the traits of hybrids between ferrets and polecats. In 1934 she wrote on the increasing trends in badger populations. She also wrote on the topic of hunting in Hounds, horses & hunting (1948). Her book The Squirrel published in 1954 was based on an albino squirrel named \\"Mr Nuts\\". She was among the first (the first was Miss Phyllis Kelway) to breed harvest mice in captivity. She published Wild animals in Britain in 1939 and regularly wrote to comment and report on wildlife observations. In 1945 she reported the observations made by Lady Seton (wife of Sir Malcolm Seton) on the mass movements of water shrews. In 1949 she was included along with Peter Medawar and others in a committee to examine cruelty to wild animals which led to protests from the National Society for the Abolition of Cruel Sports who pointed out her position as a Master of Fox Hounds and as vice-president of the British Field Sports Society. In 1954, Edglets, a brand of tea sold by Brooke Bond included a series of illustrated cards with British birds photographed by Frances Pitt. Her collection of insects is now in the Ludlow Museum although the specimens lack dates and locality data. She was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1951. She published Country years being a naturalist's memories of life in the English countryside and elsewhere in 1961, with many autobiographical notes. Other books Among the numerous books that Frances Pitt wrote are: * Tommy White-Tag, the fox (1912) * Wild creatures of garden and hedgerow (1920) * Woodland creatures: Being Some Wild Life Studies (1922) * Shetland pirates, and other wild life studies (1923) * Waterside creatures (1925) * Animal mind (1927) * The intelligence of animals (1931) * Scotty, the adventures of a highland fox (1932) * The naturalist on the prowl (1934) * Birds and the sea (1935) * Woodpeckers * Wild life studies (1935) * Nature in the wild: a selection of the world's finest photographs (1936) * How to see nature (1940) * Jane Squirrel (1942) * Betty (1943) * Meet Us in the Garden (1946) * Friends in fur and feather (1946) * The year in the countryside (1947) * Hounds, horses & hunting (1948) * Follow me (1949) * Nature through the year (1950) References Category:1888 births Category:1964 deaths Category:20th-century British women scientists Category:English naturalists Category:English nature writers Category:Nature photographers Category:Women naturalists Category:20th-century naturalists ","title":"Frances Pitt"},{"id":"45273346","text":"Metagnoma is a genus of longhorn beetles of the subfamily Lamiinae,Biolib.cz - Metagnoma.

Location  The ruins lie in the Hunsr√ºck mountains between the Idar Forest to the north and the town of Idar-Oberstein to the south at a height of about 630 metres above sea level (NN) on the Wildenburger Kopf above the valley of the Idarbach. It was the highest castle in the Hunsr√ºck.  History  The predecessor of the Wildenburg was probably a Celtic refuge fort with double ramparts from the La T√®ne period (ca. 450-50 B.C.). The Wildenburg rampart is one of a number of Celtic fortifications in southern Hunsr√ºck between the hillfort of Otzenhausen, the Ringkopf, the Altburg and the Alteburg in Soonwaldsteig. A short section of the rampart has been reconstructed as a \\"Gallic Wall\\" (murus gallicus). Around the year 350 A. D. a late Roman fort was established on the Wildenburg for a short time. In the Late Middle Ages Wildenburg was built by the Wildgrafen family on the rocks at the western tip of the circular rampart. It was first mentioned in 1330 and was pillaged and destroyed by marauding troops from Lorraine in 1651. After being partially rebuilt in 1660, the lower ward of the castle acted as the administrative headquarters for the Amt of Wildenburg until the abolition of the county in the 1792.  Description  Of the upper bailey (Oberburg) that was built on rocks only a few wall remains have survived. However, in 1980, a 22-metre-high observation tower was built on the top of the rocks that was opened in 1981. In 1859 the buildings of lower bailey (Unterburg), including the gate tower, domestic buildings and enceinte, were restored for the Prussian Forestry Commission. These buildings were further converted into the present-day castle cafe and headquarters of the Hunsr√ºck Club.

It is located at the borders of Arta and Ioannina prefectures, above the waters of Arachthos River. Administratively, it belongs to the community of Plaka-Raftaneon.Leftheris et al. (2006), p. 148 With its arch of width and height, it was the largest one-arch bridge in Greece and the Balkans, and the third largest one-arch stone bridge in Europe. It also had two small auxiliary arches of width on its two sides. It was considered \\"one of the most difficult, single-arch bridges to construct.\\" The bridge was the starting point for rafting and canoeing on Arachthos River. History =Construction= The bridge was built upon the order of Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlaziz, and was completed in 1866 under the supervision of the famous local builder Kostas Bekas ()Œ§Œπ ŒºŒ¨Œ∏Œ±ŒºŒµ Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒøŒΩ Œ†œÅœâœÑŒøŒºŒ¨œÉœÑŒøœÅŒ± ŒöœéœÉœÑŒ± ŒúœÄŒ≠Œ∫Œ± ŒºŒ≠œÉŒ± Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒÆŒªœâœÉŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒìŒµœÜœÖœÅŒπŒøœç œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ†ŒªŒ¨Œ∫Œ±œÇ from the nearby village Pramanta. Two previous attempts by other builders in 1860 and 1863 had proven unsuccessful, with the bridge collapsing during construction (in 1863 it collapsed on the very day of its inauguration). The cost of construction, 180,000 kuru≈ü, was covered by the local communities and the rich merchant Ioannis Loulis. =In operation= Plaka Bridge being crossed by tourists On 3 February 1878, during the anti-Ottoman revolt of that year, Greek troops under the command of Konstantinos Kottikas defeated the Turkish garrison of the bridge and made them retreat. Between 1881 and 1912 (the First Balkan War), the bridge marked the border between the Kingdom of Greece and the Ottoman Empire, and a customs building was erected alongside it, which still survives. Also, near the bridge there was an outpost of the Greek army and an inn. The bridge used to be a trade route, connecting Tzoumerka with Epirus and Thessaly. During World War II, it was bombed by the Germans, and withstood the bombing with minor damage. Locals repaired it using cement in 1943. On 29 February 1944, during the Axis Occupation of Greece, the was signed near the bridge among the armed groups of the Greek Resistance, EAM, EDES and EKKA. According to the treaty resistance groups agreed to refrain from infringing on each others territory and that all future war efforts will be directed against the Germans. This marked the end of the \\"first round\\" of the Greek civil war which had started at October 12, 1943. In spite of the two small -wide relief arches, the bridge's apex thickness of has been considered small by experts, causing a concentration of horizontal stresses in a region where a crack could be found.Leftheris et al. (2006), p. 149 f. During heavy rains in 2007, the bridge nearly collapsed, and a restoration was considered but not taken, raising criticism by the public. =Collapse (2015)= The bridge, which was one of the most impressive examples of Greek popular architecture, collapsed on 1 February 2015. A flash flood caused by heavy rainfall caused the Arachthos River to rip the bridge's foundations from the riverbanks leading the central section of the bridge to collapse and be washed away. The next day, Alternate Minister of Infrastructure Christos Spirtzis and representatives of the Culture Ministry travelled to the region to assess the situation and announced that it was technically feasible to restore the historic bridge. Experts have assessed the damage. The materials would be recovered from the river once water levels have fallen. , restoration work, supported by the National Technical University of Athens is over, and the rebuilt bridge was completed in the summer of 2020.

After the capture of Samohan Chaurasi area, the Phataks proceeded towards Yamuna river, displacing aborigines they established themselves in the whole Shikohabad Pargana.

Gossip benches, also called telephone tables, became popular shortly after the telephone was invented in 1876 . They were most popular between the 1930s and the 1950s , but there is no specific date of invention for this piece of furniture due to the nature of its development: over time as a result of convenience and necessity. The gossip bench began as a shelf for the telephone (then a very large and cumbersome non-portable object) to rest upon, usually in the hallway of the home. Naturally, telephone users began using regular chairs to sit on while using the telephone. It was only a matter of time until the two (shelf and chair) were combined into one stylish piece of furniture by opportunistic furniture craftsmen everywhere. A lamp and the telephone would typically be placed on the table top of the gossip bench, while a telephone directory would be stored in the drawer underneath. Different regions produced different types of gossip bench, as is true with other types of furniture. Scandinavian influence produced more sleek styles, while those in Great Britain were more ornate.

Government of Bangladesh took the initiative to build the monument in 1996. The construction began in 1999. Kashef Mahboob Chowdhury and Marina Tabassum designed the project. The main attraction of the project is a 50-meter high tower composed of stacked glass panels, which stands at the place where the Pakistani Instrument of Surrender was signed at the end of the war. Background Lt Gen A A K Niazi signing the Pakistani Instrument of Surrender marked the end of the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 and the creation of Bangladesh. The Suhrawardy Udyan of the capital Dhaka of Bangladesh is historical place. Many significant incidents took place in this place. On 7 March 1971, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered his historical speech in this ground after Yahya Khan postponed the national assembly on 1 March of the year. In his speech Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman asked the people of Bangladesh to prepare themselves for Liberation War of Bangladesh. The war broke out on 25 March, as the Pakistan Army of occupation cracked upon the Bengali population of the then East Pakistan. And after a nine-month-long liberation war Bangladesh won its freedom from Pakistan. On 16 December 1971, the commander-in-chief of East Pakistan Army Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi surrendered to the joint force of Mukti Bahini and Indian Army in this ground. To commemorate the historic events of the Liberation War of Bangladesh, the Government of Bangladesh decided to restore the memories of the war and build the Swadhinata Stambha. View of Swadhinata Stambha History In 1996, the Government of Bangladesh decided to build a monument to restore the memories of Bangladesh Liberation War in Suhrawardy Udyan of Dhaka. In 1997 a competition was organised to select the best monument for the proposed project in Suhrawardy Udyan. Kashef Mahboob Chowdhury and Marina Tabassum, two architects who graduated from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology came with a design of a suitable project. Their proposed project included a museum, multi-media projection theatre, amphitheater and other ancillary facilities in addition to the main focus of the project, the monument itself. The focal point in the experience of the space is the monument: a Tower of Light made of stacked glass sheets. The design presented by Kashef Mahboob Chowdhury and Marina Tabassum won the competition and their design was selected for the proposed project. Construction process The foundation stone of the Swadhinata Stambha was laid in 1999. The construction of the project began in the same year. The construction was completed in two phases. =First phase= At first the area allocated for the proposed project was 24 acres. Later the area was increased to 67 acres. The project included a 100 meter long glass tower, an underground museum, mural works, amphitheater, a number of walkways, a water body and a very special ‚Äòeternal flame‚Äô. The construction of the project was supervised by Ministry of Housing and Public Works. Under the first phase, the then Awami League government built the VIP and Service Blocks and most of the walkways, water body, mural works and development of south plaza and marble works. Later in 2002, BNP government established a Ministry of Liberation War Affairs. The responsibility of the supervision of this project was handed over to the newly established ministry. During BNP regime a stone holding the list of the freedom fighters of Dhaka who were martyred was made. The construction of the water-body was also completed. But the glass-tower was set aside terming it a very costly one. The then prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia inaugurated the monument on 22 October 2006 without the glass tower. =Second phase= In 2009, after the government of Awami League came to power. The government increased the cost of the project to 1.8161 Billion BDT and named it as the second phase of construction. The glass-tower of the project that was abandoned by the previous government started again. The design was revised increasing the height to 150 feet. On 7 March 2011, the government opened it for public amid a large number of its works are yet to be completed. The glass-tower was completed in 2013 at a cost of 1.47 billion BDT. Architecture The Monume & The eternal flame (left side). The main attraction of the Swadhinata Stambha is the Stambha itself. Stambha means pillar or tower in Bengali. The tower was built on the place where the commander-in-chief of East Pakistan Army Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi signed the papers of his surrender. During night, the tower looks elegant as the rays of light come out from every single inches of the tower. The whole tower turns into a white pillar. The tower is square according to the plan and is 16 feet wide from every side with an area of 64 inches. The underground museum of the project comprises several photographs with historical significance. A large photograph of the historical 7th March Speech of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is the main attraction of the underground museum. There are a number of terracotta murals on war-heroes and the events of the Liberation War, a 2000-seat auditorium, and an open-air theatre. The eternal flame stands beside the tower. The water body of the project reflects the whole tower all the day and increases the beauty of the project. But the water body is under potential threat as the local slum-dwellers use it for their daily needs.

He began his career playing in his home country for the New Zealand Breakers of the Australian NBL and the Super City Rangers of the New Zealand NBL. After a two-year stint in the United States playing college basketball for Kentucky, Wynyard returned to the Australian and New Zealand NBL. Early life and career Born and raised in Auckland, Wynyard attended Rangitoto College and helped the school's basketball team win the Auckland premier championship in 2014. That year, he travelled to the United States to play in the Jordan Brand Classic. He also played in the New Zealand NBL in 2014 for the Super City Rangers, averaging 4.6 points and 2.4 rebounds in nine games. On 15 August 2014, Wynyard signed with the New Zealand Breakers as a non-contracted development player so as to keep his amateur status and his NCAA eligibility. He appeared in two games during the 2014‚Äì15 NBL season and was a member of the Breakers' championship-winning squad. On 26 January 2015, Wynyard committed to the University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball program with the aim of joining the team in 2016‚Äì17. In April 2015, he took part in the Nike Hoop Summit in Portland, Oregon. With the Rangers in 2015, Wynyard averaged 6.2 points and 3.3 rebounds in 10 games. In October 2015, Wynyard helped Rangitoto College win the Secondary Schools National Championships while earning MVP honours. Wynyard returned to the Breakers as a development player for the 2015‚Äì16 NBL season, maintaining a non-payment contract status in order to continue protecting his amateur status ahead of joining Kentucky in December 2015. He appeared in five games over the first half of the season. College career In November 2015, Wynyard signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats. He joined the squad in December 2015 and redshirted the 2015‚Äì16 season in order to retain four full years of college eligibility. In 2016‚Äì17, Wynyard logged a mere 34 minutes in Kentucky's first 20 games, while stuck behind fellow Wildcat big men Edrice Adebayo, Isaac Humphries and Sacha Killeya-Jones. He was used only sparingly by coach John Calipari throughout the entire season. In 15 games for the Wildcats as a freshman, Wynyard averaged 3.6 minutes per game and totalled 11 points and 13 rebounds. In December of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Wynyard injured a disc in his back. Despite being sidelined with a possible season-ending injury, on 6 February 2018, Wynyard was suspended from the Kentucky basketball team due to a violation of team rules. It was reported that he attended a party with a person carrying a gun in January 2018. In early April, he left Kentucky and returned to New Zealand. Wynyard played just 97 minutes across two seasons with Kentucky, scoring 19 points. In May 2018, Wynyard transferred to Santa Clara. He ultimately did not play for the Broncos after having to sit out the 2018‚Äì19 season due to NCAA regulations. Professional career On 28 March 2019, Wynyard signed with the Southland Sharks for the 2019 New Zealand NBL season. In 19 games, he averaged 4.1 points and 3.2 rebounds per game.

He also helped open the first Krispy Kreme in Nashville, Tennessee. Lewis Rudolph later served as Vice President of Krispy Kreme, while Vernon Rudolph served as President and CEO of the company. Lewis Rudolph was born on December 6, 1919, in Marshall County, Kentucky. He was one of four children born to Rethie and Plumie Rudolph. His father, Plumie, operated a general store in Marshall County. In the early 1930s, Lewis Rudolph's uncle, Ishmael Armstrong, and his brother, Vernon, who was 18 years old at the time, began a yeast doughnut, based on a recipe they had received from a chef from New Orleans. However, the economic downturn during the Great Depression caused financial difficulties for both Plumie Rudolph's general store and Vernon Rudolph's doughnut business. The entire family relocated to Nashville to pursue better financial opportunities. Lewis Rudolph's father, Plumie, soon purchased Ishmael Armstrong's doughnut business from him. Lewis Rudolph dropped out of high school to work at the family doughnut business. He spent days mixing ingredients by hand. The doughnut shop proved successful and the family was able to expand to new shops in Charleston, West Virginia, and Atlanta, Georgia. In 1937, Vernon Rudolph established Krispy Kreme doughnuts at a new location in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He had decided to open the first Krispy Kreme in Winston-Salem due to the presence of Camel cigarettes in the city. Lewis Rudolph married Jeanne Marie Fisher, a Nashville native, in 1937, the same year that his brother opened the first branded Krispy Kreme location in North Carolina. The chain continued to expand throughout the 1940s. By the time Krispy Kreme was incorporated as a company in 1947, there were eight shops in the Southeast United States. Lewis Rudolph became Vice President of Krispy Kreme, while Vernon served as president and CEO. Lewis Rudolph moved back to Nashville from Winston-Salem in 1959 in order to acquire the city's two Krispy Kreme locations. He continued to work at Krispy Kreme for the next 48 years, until his retirement in 1985. Rudolph opened two additional Krispy Kreme franchise locations in Nashville during the 1960s ‚Äì one was located on Thompson Lane, while the other was located on West End Avenue. Vernon Rudolph, his brother and Krispy Kreme's founder, died in 1973. In 1976, Krispy Kreme merged with Beatrice Foods of Chicago. By the early 1980s, sales at Krispy Kreme were in decline. In 1983, Lewis Rudolph, together with other franchisees, organized a buyout of the doughnut company. Lewis Rudolph sold his Krispy Kreme shops to the company in 1983 and retired from the doughnut business in 1985. Lewis Rudolph died in Nashville, Tennessee, on December 28, 2014, at the age of 95. He was survived his wife, Jeanne Fisher Rudolph, whom he married in 1937; four children, twelve grandchildren, twenty-two great- grandchildren and one great, great-grandchild.

A portion of the star's mass can be captured into an accretion disk around the black hole, resulting in a temporary flare of electromagnetic radiation as matter in the disk is consumed by the black hole. According to early papers, tidal disruption events should be an inevitable consequence of massive black holes' activity hidden in galaxy nuclei, whereas later theorists concluded that the resulting explosion or flare of radiation from the accretion of the stellar debris could be a unique signpost for the presence of a dormant black hole in the center of a normal galaxy.  History  Physicist John A. Wheeler suggested that the breakup of a star in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole could induce acceleration of the released gas to relativistic speeds by the so-called \\"tube of toothpaste effect\\".Wheeler,J.A., 1971, Pontificae Acad. Sei. Scripta Varia, 35, 539 Wheeler succeeded in applying the relativistic generalization of the classical Newtonian tidal disruption problem to the neighborhood of a Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole. However, these early works restricted their attention to incompressible star models and/or to stars penetrating slightly into the Roche radius, conditions in which the tides would have small amplitude. In 1976, astronomers Juhan Frank and Martin J. Rees of the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy explored the possibility of black holes at the centers of galaxies and globular clusters, defining a critical radius under which stars are disturbed and swallowed by the black hole, suggesting that it is possible to observe these events in certain galaxies. But at the time, the English researchers did not propose any precise model or simulation. This speculative prediction and this lack of theoretical tools aroused the curiosity of Jean- Pierre Luminet and Brandon Carter of the Paris Observatory in the early 1980s who invented the concept of TDE. Their first works were published in 1982 in the journal Nature and in 1983 in Astronomy & Astrophysics. The authors had managed to describe the tidal disturbances in the heart of AGNs based on the \\"stellar pancake outbreak\\" model to use Luminet's expression, a model describing the tide field generated by a supermassive black hole, and the effect they called the \\"pancake detonation\\" to qualify the radiation outbreak resulting from these disturbances. Later, in 1986, Luminet and Carter published in the journal Astrophysical Journal Supplement an analysis covering all the cases of TDE and not only the 10% producing \\"spaghettifications\\" and other \\"pancakes flamb√©es\\". It was only a decade later, in 1990, that the first TDE-compliant candidates were detected through \\"All Sky\\" X-ray survey of DLR's/NASA's ROSAT satellite. Since then, more than a dozen candidates have been discovered, including more active sources in ultraviolet or visible for a reason that remained mysterious.  Discovery  Finally, the theory of Luminet and Carter was confirmed by the observation of spectacular eruptions resulting from the accretion of stellar debris by a massive object located in the heart of the AGN (e.g. NGC 5128 or NGC 4438) but also in the heart of the Milky Way (Sgr A *). The TDE theory even explains the superluminous supernova SN 2015L, better known by the code name ASASSN-15lh, a supernova that exploded just before being absorbed beneath the horizon of a massive black hole. Today, all known TDEs and TDE candidates have been listed in \\"The Open TDE Catalog\\"https://tde.space/ run by the Harvard CfA, which has had 91 entries since 1999.  New observations  In September 2016, a team from the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, Anhui, China, announced that, using data from NASA Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, a stellar tidal disruption event was observed at a known black hole. Another team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., detected three additional events. In each case, astronomers hypothesized that the astrophysical jet created by the dying star would emit ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, which would be absorbed by dust surrounding the black hole and emitted as infrared radiation. Not only was this infrared emission detected, but they concluded that the delay between the jet's emission of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation and the dust's emission of infrared radiation may be used to estimate the size of the black hole devouring the star. In September 2019, scientists using the TESS satellite announced they had witnessed a tidal disruption event of the star ASASSN-19bt, 375 million light years away. In July 2020, astronomers reported the observation of a \\"hard tidal disruption event candidate\\" associated with ASASSN-20hx, located near the nucleus of galaxy NGC 6297, and noted that the observation represented one of the \\"very few tidal disruption events with hard powerlaw X-ray spectra\\".

Life Sylvester Hay's birth is considered to be on 4 March 1777. Her paternal grandfather had been the vicar of Malden, but her father, John Sylvester Hay, was a ship's surgeon serving on board the third- rate ship of the line HMS Nassau. He was also the head surgeon at the Royal Hospital in Calcutta and he may have managed a theatre. He died in his thirties leaving his daughter who was then nine. Hay appeared first as an actress in Richmond where she was encouraged by Dorothea Jordan. She reputedly received a letter from Robbie Burns inviting her back to Scotland after she went there in 1793. The following year she became Mrs Litchfield. Her new husband was a civil servant who had written a few prologues and epilogues. After a brief gap she returned to acting in 1796 and she appeared in a benefit performance for Mary Ann Yates in 1797 at The Haymarket. On 22 March 1802 she appeared in a one woman show at The Haymarket called The Captive by \\"Monk\\" Lewis. This gothic monodrama recounts the story of a wife imprisoned by her husband. The stage directions included shrieks, clanking and screaming. Litchfield was complimented for her delivery \\"in the most perfect manner\\" as she plays a woman denied any human contact and kept in a modern dungeon. She is not mad but realises that she will soon be a maniac. The play is thought to have been suggested by one of Mary Wollstonecraft's books. It was said that even the staff of the theatre left in horror. The play was only staged once. Litchfield died in 1854, most likely in London, after a long marriage and six children.K. A.

Such an interview is typically semi-structured or unstructured. Couple interviews are important in household research, often from a psychological, sociological, anthropological or social geographical perspective, and are also frequently used within health research. A couple interview is a form of joint interviewing (interviews involving two interviewees), the subject of a growing methodological research literature. There is an ongoing methodological controversy over whether couples should ideally be interviewed together or apart. Bj√∏rnholt and Farstad argue that the couple interview should be seen as a distinct form of the qualitative research interview, and argue that the couple interview has several advantages over individual interviews, in particular in \\"solving the ethical problems of anonymity and consent among interviewees, and [resulting] in the production of rich data, including observational data,\\" and in intra-couple dynamics and the interaction between the informants, as well as with the researcher(s), in the interview situation, which may also reveal controversies and areas of conflict, by providing a reflective space for both partners together, which enables them to challenge as well as to reinforce each other's accounts. They further argue that the researcher plays an important role, as couple interviews may be seen as an arena of \\"family display\\", using a concept originally proposed by Janet Finch. The opportunity to observe shared storytelling is regarded as a widely documented advantage of joint interviewing.

It is named after actress Charlotte Cushman (1817-1876). The Charlotte Cushman Foundation funds Philadelphia, regional non-profit theatres with grants for performers. The purpose of the Foundation is to promote the theatre arts and the public appreciation thereof. The Cushman Foundation was founded by the officers of the Charlotte Cushman Club and Library. Originally established in 1907, and closed in 1999, the Charlotte Cushman Club was a boarding house for touring actresses who needed safe, respectable, inexpensive lodgings. Beginning in 1957, in honor of the Club's 50th anniversary, the Cushman Club has given the Cushman Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre to a distinguished contributor to the vitality of the theatre. Beginning in 1995, the Charlotte Cushman Award for Outstanding Leading Actress in a Play continues to be awarded as part of Philadelphia's Barrymore Awards for Excellence in Theater.  History  = The Charlotte Cushman Club = The Charlotte Cushman Club was established as a boarding house for touring actresses needing respectable, inexpensive, safe lodgings. Women performers were unwelcome in many hotels; and they were frequently the recipients of bold advances from drummers (traveling salesmen) and other uncouth types. The Cushman Club was hailed in 1923 as \\"the leading organization of its kind in the country.\\" Cushman Clubs were established in Chicago and Boston as well as Philadelphia. The Club was founded by Quaker Lydia Ellicott Morris in 1907. It was named in honor of Charlotte Cushman (1816-1876), America‚Äôs first internationally renowned actress and a favorite dining companion of Abraham Lincoln. It had been Cushman‚Äôs lifelong dream to establish hostelries where women of the stage could escape \\"the brothel-like atmosphere of cheap hotels and rude stares\\" of corset drummers ‚Äì and worse. Cushman herself died years previous to the founding of the club, and did not found nor fund either the Club or the Foundation. An early supporter, Mr. Peterson, donated $50,000. Annual teas were another source of funds. Strong support came from the Theatrical Managers Association and from various women's clubs. Elaborate fundraisers involved both stage and society supporters, to raise money for the club. The Cushman Club became successful as a ladies theatre club, hospitality center and clubhouse for both men and women. Over the years, the club had several locations. Early on, lodgings were located 10th and Pine, and then at the southwest corner of 12th and Locust Streets. As of 1920, it moved to 1010 Spruce Street. Rooms there were named in honor of actresses who donated furnishings, including Julia Marlowe, Lillian Russell and Adele Ritchie. In 1929, 1010 Spruce Street provided lodging for 50 actresses, and had a waiting list of 100. The Spruce Street location was bought by Miss Olive Pardee in 1931 and given to the Jefferson Medical College Hospital, to become a home for nurses. Rooms were also provided at The Bellevue-Stratford Hotel. In 1963 the Club moved to 239 S. Camac Street, former home of the Poor Richard Club. = Cushman Awards = The Cushman Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre was inaugurated in 1957 as a tribute to a distinguished contributor to the vitality of the theatre. Shirley Booth was the first recipient, followed by stage luminaries: Richard Burton, Zoe Caldwell, Carol Channing, Jose Ferrer, Henry Fonda, Julie Harris, Helen Hayes, Katharine Hepburn, Mary Martin, Robert Morse, Ginger Rogers, and others, all of whom visited the Club for post- curtain parties. From 1995 on, the Charlotte Cushman Award for Outstanding Leading Actress in a Play was presented at the Philadelphia Theatre Alliance Barrymore Awards ceremony, a tradition continued by the Foundation. Zoe Caldwell was the first recipient for her starring role in Terrence McNally‚Äôs Master Class, which premiered at the Philadelphia Theatre Company at the Plays and Players Theatre, before going on to New York. = Closing of the Cushman Club = On June 3, 1999, the Cushman Club's fifteen member board, headed by president Annette Linck, voted to close the Charlotte Cushman Club. The club had \\"outlived its original residential and educational purposes\\". The board chose to redefine its mission so as to \\"enhance and better support a variety of theatre programs\\". The club building on Camac Street was sold as of 2001. Since restored, the Cushman Building has been granted a preservation easement by the Preservation Alliance of Philadelphia, to protect the exterior and parts of the interior. The Eleanor Wescott Library of rare theatre memorabilia and books had been housed in the Club. Artwork in the collection included framed Hogarth prints; a portrait and a marble bust of Charlotte Cushman; and portraits of Fanny Brice, Edwin Forrest and Ellen Terry. Two toy theaters were also included, one by Charles Boucher of the Academy of Music, who incorporated recognizable details of the academy into the model. Much of the Wescott collection was dispersed to appropriate institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, the Free Library and the archives of the Academy of Music. Other items including Fanny Brice's grand piano were sold at auction. In addition, the Cushman Club Conference Room was established in the University of the Arts Tara Building, for the Dean of the Theatre Department. Cushman Club memorabilia is exhibited in the Cushman Conference Room; and in the department‚Äôs lobby gallery. The Club archives are housed in the University Of Pennsylvania Van Pelt Library.  Charlotte Cushman Foundation  The Charlotte Cushman Foundation was founded in the year 2000 by the officers of the Charlotte Cushman Club and Library. Funds from the sale of the Cushman building and its contents were added to the existing endowment from the Charlotte Cushman Club, forming a basis for making grants. As of 2014, Cushman has made grants totaling almost $600,000. All CCF Trustees are women, as were the officers of the Cushman Club before them. Two of the Cushman Club officers, Cirel Magen and Audrey Walters, remain active as CCF Trustees. The first president of the Foundation was Donna Thomas;[22] the second was Jeanne Wrobleski;[23] the third was Cirel Magen; followed by Geraldine Duclow, Kathleen Stephenson and Therese Willis.
