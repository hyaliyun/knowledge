Her latest Novel, Nathan, was nominated for the 2019 Sapir Prize. She is also the founding and chief editor of the Vashti prose series at Resling Publishing and a doctoral student at the department for comparative literature at Tel Aviv University. Her dissertation discusses the notion of cities of refuge in the Babylonian Talmud and modern Jewish literature. She was born in Nes Ziona, Israel, and later lived in Kibbutz Alumot and Kibbutz Ein Gev. In 1979 she moved with her family to Haifa where she lived for about ten years. In 1989, her family immigrated to the United States and she remained in Tel Aviv. At the age of 27 she began studying literature at Tel Aviv University, from which she graduated with honors. In 2004, she founded Vashti, a prose series published by Resling Publishing. In addition to her writing in prose, Adi Sorek also writes essays on literature and other subjects.

Nathan, a successful businessman who had lost his job and got into some serious debt, leaves his family behind in Israel and travels to New York in search of employment. He sleeps at a friend‚Äôs place in Brooklyn and dreams of getting an interview with Hal Griffith, a tycoon capable ‚Äì so they say ‚Äì of turning everything around. But Nathan‚Äôs path to Griffith‚Äôs door grows ever trickier. And meanwhile, Nathan, who remained speechless at his father‚Äôs funeral, wanders the streets of New York ‚Äì which is unforgettably portrayed in this novel ‚Äì and the city conjures words for him which he had never known. Little by little, Nathan becomes unmoored from more and more of his life and is beckoned by memories not his own, though he recognizes in them the mark of the silences that have always enveloped him. From one street corner to the next, from one bench to another, Nathan is summoned to the threshold of ancient stories, which he reiterates through his own tales: the man depleted of deeds and of stories has become unawares a narrator. Adi Sorek‚Äôs Hebrew traces this metamorphosis as it slips in and out of climates and melodies that have been marginalized in contemporary Israeli culture, prophesizing its forgotten history with a marvelous filigree collage. Nathan captures the experience of immigration in today‚Äôs global era with sadness-tinged humor, linking it to the tradition of Jewish immigration to New York in the early 20th century. Nathan discovers the United States as a harsh dreamland while Israel, the abandoned homeland, remains dear to heart but laden with problems and failure. *Sometimes you lose people (short story collection) Yediot Books 2013 (ed: Navit Barel) - Winner of the Goldberg Prize. The book opens with a novella entitled ‚ÄúSometimes You Lose People‚Äù ‚Äì about the detached existence of a young woman who longs to find a lost friend and in the process raises questions about closeness and loss. The novella, inspired by Gertrud Stein‚Äôs style, is written in an intense and musical syntactic rhythm, contrasts a slightly aloof-amused register with some pain-filled contents. The rest of the book consists of short, sometimes very short stories, creating a thematic patchwork quilt which moves between homelessness and homeliness.

It is a kind of ale, closely related to the Finnish sahti, and Norwegian Malt√∏l with a smoky, bitter-sweet, spicy (juniper) flavor. It is similar to gruit. It is similar to an everyday drink used during the Viking Age in most Nordic countries. The tradition of brewing drikke has survived on Gotland, a process that was originally carried out exclusively by women. Difficult to produce for commercial distribution, it has become a cultural marker for Gotlanders. An annual drikke brewing world championship is held in Gotland each autumn.  The brew  Drikke is a traditional, homebrewed, fermented, unfiltered and unpasteurized alcoholic beverage made on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. The main ingredients are juniper boughs, malt, hops, yeast, water and sugar. The taste is smoky, bitter-sweet, full-bodied and spicy with a significant juniper flavor. Usually dark yellow to golden brown, sometimes with a pink tint and somewhat turbid, it is usually consumed while it is still young and fermenting. Drikke is a perishable product that takes about a week to ferment and should be consumed within another two weeks. After that the taste usually deteriorates, depending on the recipe and the brewing technique. Because of the brew's sweetness, it can be hard to appreciate its alcohol content, which is anywhere from 3 to 12% depending on the amount of sugar added, usually 4-5%.  History  A woman offering a Viking a drink. Picture stone from Halla, Gotland 8th-9th century. The name gotlandsdricka literally means \\"Gotlandic drink\\". Gotlanders take great care to distinguish between drikke and ale or beer. Drikke was originally served only with meals, as is milk, water or wine in various modern day cultures. Beer and ale were once considered \\"alcoholic beverages\\", whereas different types of malt drinks and drikke were not‚Äîthese were served to everyone in the family including children. In pre-industrialized Sweden, these drinks were made from malt, juniper, birch sap and honey. The drink made from juniper was considered the poor man's drink and the birch sap even more so. Malt drinks were regarded as the best and were served at special occasions. Simpler drinks made from honey were not brewed like mead. After the honey had been extracted from the honeycombs, they were boiled in water. After cooling, the wax was removed and the remaining honey water left to ferment. Only two of these are still frequently used with meals: svagdricka and gotlandsdricka. Since the Viking Age up until the time of the Industrial Revolution, brewing ale and drikke on Gotland was traditionally done by women. Men could help fetching water, wood, juniper or making the necessary equipment but the brewing itself was strictly for women. A farm's reputation was often at stake when it came to making good brews for the people who worked on the farm and for guests, and a matron would take pride in her brewing skills. Gotlandsdricka is essentially the same everyday brew that the Vikings drank. Brewing techniques have been updated through the centuries, but the ingredients and taste remain the same. Originally this kind of brew was made in all Nordic countries, but the widespread tradition of its brewing has only survived into modern times in small more isolated areas, like the island of Gotland. When hops were introduced in Scandinavia during the 13th century, these were used to compliment drikke's juniper boughs as flavoring. Gotland, as well, retained the tradition of using juniper although some hops were added to recipes, as it was a better preservative and added more flavor. The main flavoring was still juniper boughs and sweet gale. During the 20th century, sugar became a substitute for honey as the sweetener in drikke, but it is still brewed with honey, or without any additional sweetener at all, in parts of the island. Gotlandsdricka is closely related to the Finnish sahti, and Norwegian korn√∏l which is made using the same ingredients and techniques.  Brewing process  A rostbunn The brewing process for gotlandsdricka is started by malting grain into malt. The grain can be barley, wheat, rye or oats and the choice of grain depends on what is grown and available locally. The malt is produced by letting the grain sprout and then drying it. On Gotland the drying is carried out either in the farm's sauna house or in a small, special hut called a k√∂lna, usually built on top of the brewing house. Most malt is dried in the smoke of a fire lit below the k√∂lna, but there are farms that let the hot air circulate in pipes under the bed of malt to minimize the smoky flavor of the drikke. There are almost as many versions of wood use and if it should be with or without the bark, as there are farms. The k√∂lna could also be used for drying flax or as a smoker for meat, fish, lamb and other foodstuffs . Finally, the dried malt is ground with opinions varying as to how fine the end product should be. The malt is then placed in a wooden mash tun and hot brewing liquor made from water boiled with juniper boughs and berries, is poured into the tun. The porridge-like mixture called mash is first thoroughly agitated and then left to rest for a couple of hours. Brewing is done in a wooden tub called a rostbunn with a tap at the bottom. In the rostbunn layers of the different component for the brewing are positioned. This is called \\"laying the bunn\\". Getting the bunn right is the most difficult and crucial part of the brewing. The layers must be compact enough for the liquid to flow slowly through the rostbunn but not so compact as to stop the flow completely. There are a number of traditions for \\"laying the bunn\\", many of which include old superstitions‚Äîamongst others complete silence is required during the work, no \\"outsiders\\" may be present, a piece of steel or an ancient stone axe should be placed in the bunn. A lattice of shaved juniper branches is placed in the bottom of the rostbunn, and the area close to the tap is padded with junipers boughs. The tub is then lined with threshed straw (sometimes thinner branches of juniper are used instead) and the mash placed in the middle of the bunn. When the bunn has settled, more hot brewing liquor is poured onto the mash and the tap carefully opened. The wort, or l√§nnu, is collected in a bucket under the tap. Brewing liquor can be added continuously to the bunn depending on the strength of l√§nnu required. Sometimes the first l√§nnu is kept separate as a stronger brew for special occasions, and the last used for everyday drinking. The collected l√§nnu is boiled‚Äîthe longer the boiling the sweeter the drikke‚Äîand additional flavoring such as hops or sweet gale and sugar or honey are added. The brew is then cooled and filtered. Yeast, usually ordinary baking yeast, is added and the drikke put into wooden barrels or glass carboys to ferment for four or five days. Modern brewers have experimented with bottling drikke before fermentation, to make it carbonated and sparkling.  Modern brewing  In modern drikke brewing, most wooden vessels have been replaced by more practical tubs and buckets made of steel or plastic. The malt is purchased from breweries and the entire process can be shortened to boiling a textile bag containing the malt, hops and other spices directly in the brewing liquor using a large pot placed on the stove. The fermenting is mostly done in plastic jerrycans.  Competition  The drikke brewing world championship has been held annually since 1991, traditionally in a location on the southern part of the island. The competition is open to anyone brewing gotlandsdricka, and the jury consisting of six persons normally get 35-40 entries to evaluate. , the youngest winner of the championship was 22-year-old Daniel Lundstr√∂m in 2014. The 2008 championship was documented by the German television station ProSieben for their series \\"Galileo\\", which included programs about disgusting dishes from around the world. The focus was on the traditional Gotlandic food‚Äîcooked lamb eyes and lamb skulls, being served with the drikke.  Commercial brewing  Juniperus communis When the annual Medieval Week on Gotland started in 1984, drikke was brewed and sold in the medieval market. In 2000, this came to the attention of the legal authorities on Sweden's mainland and the police intervened and stopped the sales. The main problem was that the alcohol content in the brew was not fixed but varied considerably. Another problem was that since the drikke is highly perishable, it cannot be made with techniques and bottled in ways that conforms with the rules and regulations of the National Food Administration. This also prevented drikke being served at events in connection with Gotland being chosen as the \\"Food Capital\\" of Sweden in 2013. Several motions have been made to the Riksdag to enable it to be served or sold at public events. All of these have been denied. In 2012, the Gute ving√•rd (the Gute Vineyard) created the first commercial whisky made from gotlandsdricka, \\"Gutevin Sudret Whiskey\\". The first batch was laid down in casks in 2004 and aged until 2013. The Jester King Brewery in Texas makes a version of Gotlandsdricka, and it is also brewed at Niagara College in Canada.  Cultural marker  When the northern part of Gotland became industrialized in the early 20th century, local traditions and customs also changed. Homebrewing was mostly abandoned and the art of drikke making receded to the southern part of the island. Towards the end of the 1960s, interest in malt-brewing was revived as part of the wave of rediscovering old traditions and crafts that swept over Sweden at that time. Gotland had also developed into a place where tourism was becoming ever more vital to the island's economy, and traditional Gotlandic culture and crafts, such as drikke, became a way for the people on the island to retain their own standing and identity: See also *List of beer styles  References  = Bibliography =  *  External links  *Gotland has 60,000 people, 96 churches, and several hundred brewers *Recipe for Gotlandsdricka Category:Gotland Category:Swedish drinks Category:Types of beer Category:Beer in Sweden Category:Cultural history of Sweden ","title":"Gotlandsdricka"},{"id":"45274339","text":"R.

Despite its lowly position in the football league pyramid, the club has gained widespread notoriety and almost legendary status for its humorous approach to football and promotion of football at the amateur level, making it one of the best supported and recognisable non-professional football clubs. Etymology The club name was chosen on the basis of the popular 1988 comedy film Pi≈Çkarski Poker which, although fictitious, was later widely seen to have been an accurate representation of match-fixing practices at the time. One of the fictitious clubs in the league was a team by the name Odlew Pozna≈Ñ, which only had a few seconds' worth of appearances in the film and a very minor role to the plot, the chairman of the club being even denied a speaking part. The founders of the club were inspired by the Warsaw-based club Karmazyn Warszawa, who similarly gained notoriety for their poor performances and humorous approach to amateur football. The abbreviation \\"HKS\\" stands for Husarski Klub Sportowy, meaning Hussar Sports Club, chosen as there were no other clubs with such a name (as opposed to the popular \\"KS\\", \\"PKS\\" or \\"FC\\" abbreviations). History and humour Originally the club was set up by Gazeta Wyborcza reporters, although the club has moved away from its image as a \\"reporter club\\". After having the worst record of all the teams in Greater Poland in their inaugural season in 2002 in the lowest division B-klasa, the club adopted slogans such as \\"We're the worst, we want to be better\\", \\"A real defeat is not to lose, but not to try in the first place\\", \\"Hope dies last\\", \\"Odlew will always stay up\\" (they play in the bottom division, therefore there is no relegation from the division) and modifying the former popular advert \\"Almost like ≈ªywiec - Almost makes a huge difference\\" to \\"Almost like Odlew\\". Their recent fortunes have varied, almost gaining promotion a few times to the A-klasa (but having never been able to achieve promotion) means that the club is now regularly achieving its goal to not be the worst-placed team in the country. On their website, the table is routinely turned upside down. \\"This way we can be top\\" is the official reason. To celebrate their 10th anniversary in 2012, the club organised a match with the (arguably) best amateur team in the world, the champion of San Marino, F.C. Domagnano, prompting a \\"best v worst team in the world\\" comparison. Odlew only just lost the match 0-1 after a hard-fought evenly matched game.http://www.wykop.pl/link/1106537/b-klasowy- odlew-poznan-kontra-wielokrotny-mistrz-san-marino/ The club secured a very lucrative (especially for a club its size) sponsorship agreement with Europe's largest brewery Obolon. Later Odlew challenged the Waldemar Fornalik's national team to a match after a series of disappointing results by the national side, claiming \\"there are no weak sides anymore\\"; however, the challenge was not accepted. Ground They play at the training ground of Lech Pozna≈Ñ, therefore having the comfort of one of the best pitches for an amateur team, at ul. Ptasia (Bird Street) which has prompted their \\"stadium\\" to be nicknamed Arena auf Ptasia and Bird Arena. Supporters and rivalries The club boasts such fans such as Czes≈Çaw Michniewicz, Bogus≈Çaw Baniak, Rafa≈Ç Ulatowski, Katarzyna Skowro≈Ñska-Dolata, and Franciszek Smuda, who when asked is there any team he is afraid of replied \\"Yes, Odlew\\". They have good relations with local professional teams Lech and Warta, often playing friendly matches against them. After the establishment of KKS Wiara Lecha, the frequent encounters were immediately dubbed the \\"Pozna≈Ñ Derby\\", prompting major mobilisation among the Lech fans due to the opposition of Gazeta Wyborcza and media in general, although Odlew was quick to denounce its ties to the newspaper. Odlew so far has lost ever derby game against Wiara Lecha. The club even had a short-lived ultras group M≈Çoda Nabojka. The fans also frequently appear supporting the Polish national team in other sports, as well as having produced supporter merchandise common for fans of much larger teams, such as scarves and flags. Currently, the fans (and players) maintain good relations with B≈Çƒôkitni Owi≈Ñska, as well of course their protoplast Karmazyn Warszawa. Their main rivals are listed as the WZPN match observers, Rakieta Biedrusko and referee \\"Mr Paluszak from Stryk√≥w\\".

She was a doctor of physics.  Biography  Maria Asterblum was born in Warsaw. Her father was Maurycy, a lawyer and her mother Salomea. In 1915, she entered the Warsaw University, newly opened after the Russians left Warsaw, studying Physics. She was one of only four women admitted in the first year of studies. In 1924, she became the first doctor promoted by the Department of Physics; her doctoral advisor was Stefan Pie≈Ñkowski. She worked as a senior assistant at the Department of Experimental Physics at Warsaw University and has written several papers in the field of optical tests. On 3 July 1927, she married Mieczys≈Çaw Proner, doctor of pharmacy and Warsaw University lecturer. On 14 January 1929, their only daughter Janina was born. They continued their work at the Warsaw University until 1938. When World War II broke out, Mieczys≈Çaw Proner was mobilized to the army and captured by the Soviets. In the spring of 1940 he was murdered in Kharkov. After the establishment of the Warsaw Ghetto Maria, at the urging of friends, remained with her daughter on the Aryan side. She received documents in the name Pogonowska, which she used for the rest of her life. She repeatedly changed her residence and made her living by trading in foodstuffs, cigarettes and soap. Her older sister and parents were sent to Warsaw Ghetto, as well as the family of her husband. Pogonowska and her daughter were in the district of Ochota during the Warsaw Uprising and were cast out of their apartment to the labor camp in Bunzlau (Boles≈Çawiec), which was liberated by the Soviet Army in February 1945. At the time, they were unaware of Mieczys≈Çaw Proner's death, who was omitted in the lists of the victims of Katy≈Ñ massacre, disclosed by the Germans in 1943. After the war, Pogonowska decided not to return to her scientific career, instead working for the House for Chronically Ill Children in Warsaw. She also contributed to the acquisition of land for the orphanages house and she was active in its planning, construction and furnishing. She worked there until her retirement in 1962. During this time she was unable to determine the fate of her husband. During retirement she was not inactive, taking care of her grandchildren and teaching classes at the Medical Academy of Warsaw. In 1968, her daughter Janina and her family migrated to Israel and Maria went with them. She cared for her grandchildren and later great-grandchildren and, for a time, worked a job renting out rented Polish books. She went through a formal explanation of the circumstances of her husband's death in 1990 and in 1994 participated in a ceremony that planted thousands of trees near Jerusalem to symbolize the Katy≈Ñ Woods. A piece written by her between 1995‚Äì2000 called Memoirs Warszawianka appeared on the pages of the \\"Quarterly Jewish History\\" in 2009. In 1980, at her request, Maria Palester was honored Righteous Among the Nations title. Almost until the end of her very long life, she remained active, was interested in ongoing politics, read Polish books, kept contact with Warsaw orphanage. On the occasion of her 110th birthday, she received the congratulations from the presidents of Poland and Israel and from Irena Sendler. Pogonowska died at age 111 years 258 days on 15 July 2009 in Israel. Her daughter, Janina, after completing medical studies, worked in Warsaw Medical University as a doctor of bacteriology. In Israel, she achieved the title of Professor of medical microbiology at the Tel Aviv Medical University.

This family is used to build a predictive model based on given observation. It works based on the concept of separate-and-conquer to directly induce rules from a given training set and build its knowledge repository. Algorithms under RULES family are usually available in data mining tools, such as KEEL and WEKA, known for knowledge extraction and decision making.  Overview  RULES family algorithms are mainly used in data mining to create a model that predicts the actions of a given input features. It goes under the umbrella of inductive learning, which is a machine learning approach. In this type of learning, the agent is usually provided with previous information to gain descriptive knowledge based on the given historical data. Thus, it is a supervised learning paradigm that works as a data analysis tool, which uses the knowledge gained through training to reach a general conclusion and identify new objects using the produced classifier. Inductive learning had been divided into two types: decision tree (DT) and covering algorithms (CA). DTs discover rules using decision tree based on the concept of divide-and-conquer, while CA directly induces rules from the training set based on the concept of separate and conquers. Although DT algorithms was well recognized in the past few decades, CA started to attract the attention due to its direct rule induction property, as emphasized by Kurgan et al. [1]. Under this type of inductive learning approach, several families have been developed and improved. RULES family [2], known as rule extraction system, is one family of covering algorithms that separate each instance or example when inducing the best rules. In this family, the resulting rules are stored in an ‚ÄòIF condition THEN conclusion‚Äô structure. It has its own induction procedure that is used to induce the best rules and build the knowledge repository.  Induction procedure  To induce the best rules based on a given observation, RULES family start by selecting (separating) a seed example to build a rule, condition by condition. The rule that covers the most positive examples and the least negative examples are chosen as the best rule of the current seed example. It allows the best rule to cover some negative examples to handle the increase flexibility and reduce the overfitting problem and noisy data in the rule induction. When the coverage performance reaches a specified threshold, it marks the examples that match the induced rules without deletion. This prevents the repetition of discovering the same rule as well as preserves the coverage accuracy and the generality of new rules. After that, the algorithm is repeated to select (conquer) another seed example until all the examples are covered. Hence, only one rule can be generated at each step.  Algorithms  Several versions and algorithms have been proposed in RULES family, and can be summarized as follows: * RULES-1 [3] is the first version in RULES family and was proposed by prof. Pham and prof. Aksoy in 1995. * RULES-2 [4] is an upgraded version of RULES-1, in which every example is studied separately. * RULES-3 [5] is another version that contained all the properties of RULES-2 as well as other additional features to generates more general rules. * RULES-3Plus [6] is an extended version of RULES-3 with two additional functionalities. * RULES-4 [7] is the first incremental version in the RULES family. * RULES-5 [8] is the first RULES version that handles continuous attributes without discretization. It was also extended to produce RULES-5+[9], which improves the performance using a new rule space representation scheme. * RULES-6 [10] is a scalable version of RULES family developed as an extension of RULES-3 plus. * RULES-F [11] is an extension of RULES-5 that handles not only continuous attributes but also continuous classes. A new rule space representation scheme was also integrated to produce an extended version called RULES-F+ [9]. * RULES-SRI [12] is another scalable RULES algorithm, developed to improve RULES-6 scalability. * Rule Extractor-1 (REX-1) [13] is an improvement of RULES-3, RULES-3 Plus, and RULES-4 to shortened the process time and produced simpler models with fewer rules. * RULES-IS [14] an incremental algorithm inspired by the immune systems. * RULES-3EXT [15] is an extension of RULES-3 with additional features. * RULES-7 [16] is an extension of RULES-6, in which it applies specialization over one seed at a time. * RULES-8 [17] is an improved version that deals with continuous attributes online. * RULES-TL [18] is another scalable algorithm that was proposed to enhance the performance and speed while introducing more intelligent aspects. * RULES-IT [19] is an incremental version that is built based on RULES-TL to incrementally deal with large and incomplete problems.  Applications  Covering algorithms, in general, can be applied to any machine learning application field, as long as it supports its data type. Witten, Frank and Hall [20] identified six main fielded applications that are actively used as ML applications, including sales and marketing, judgment decisions, image screening, load forecasting, diagnosis, and web mining. RULES algorithms, in particular, were applied in different manufacturing and engineering applications [21]. RULES-3 EXT was also applied over signature verification and the algorithm performance was verified by Aksoy and Mathkour [22]. Recently, Salem and Schmickl [23] have studied the efficiency of RULEs-4 in predating agent's density.  See also  * Decision Tree * WEKA * KEEL * Machine learning * C4.5 algorithm  References  [1] L.

Designed by Wawrzyniec Lorek, raised between 1565 and 1571. Over the years the building was a supervisors‚Äô residence of Cracow‚Äôs chapter house and one of the greatest constructions in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship. The very first information in detail about the building itself were provided by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tatarkiewicz in his publications about modern architecture in Poland. History In the 14th century, canonry had the wooden residence situated, as nowadays, on the east side of the city, which burned completely in 1532. Since then, it has been rebuilt many times. Final 16th-century construction of mansion house was more durable, as it was made out of brick and was also a decent defensive place, due to its location: between the backwaters and near Dobrzynka river. Part of the castle was situated on the opposite side of the river where the New City was going to be built at that time. The local legend says that located in New City St. Mateusz church had connection with the ‚Äúcastle‚Äù through a tunnel. Tunnel was exclusively used by Pabianka princess, in case somebody might see her, as her beauty left much to be desired. Nevertheless, St. Mateusz church and the residence of Cracow‚Äôs chapter house were the only two brick buildings in the city at the very beginning of the 19th century that last undamaged. Building Pabianice dwor Build of Manor in Pabianice started in 1565 and it erected over five years. The leading architect was Wawrzyniec Lorek, with whom Cracow‚Äôs chapter Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski made a deal. As a reward he obliged to pay the architect 50 golden coins, popularly called ‚Äúflorens‚Äù, and natural goods as wheat or oat. But for the precision and diligence of Lorek the process of building went smooth and fast without any delay. This fact pleased the Cracow‚Äôs chapter, who was eager to finalize the project and started to fortify the mansion. In 1570 there was 10horse castle guard, defensive ditches and worth to say is that the minor hasn‚Äôt been changed or damaged from that time. Although the residence was finished at the beginning of 1571, there were still some works to be done inside the manor ‚Äì paintings in great chamber and sculptures. Not until 1796 when the mansion house in Pabianice has been the residence of Cracow‚Äôs chapter house, did it became the residence of Prussian goods administration. Till the end of 1822, the building was occupied by some tenants of Pabianice economics. Later it was hand over to weaving manufacturers‚Äô families. In 1833it was the headquarter of municipal office. After the World War II transformed into Museum Of Pabianice City, which exists to these days. Architecture Minor in Pabianice is late renaissance brick building. Rectangular in shape, size 18 meters by 13 meters, has only one floor with corners risalit. Crowned with attic (It is said to be one of the most beautiful attics in Poland) with holes through which gargoyles pass. The interior was finished with barrel vaults with lunettes and the ground floor plan was exactly the same as the 1st floor. In the north-east and south-west corners ‚Äúcastle‚Äù has two towers with embrasures. The sentence in Latin ‚ÄûSIC TRANSIT GLORIA MUNDI‚Äù (‚ÄúThus passes the glory of the world.\\") is craved in one of the niches. On the ground floor windows are decorated with ‚ÄûPoraj‚Äù and ‚ÄûAaron‚Äù family crests stone bordings and there is also a room with an 18th- century rococo fireplace. Till now, through the three centuries the manor in Pabianice had only one major reconstruction ‚Äì hemispherical tower was built from the west side of erection in the 19th century and the entrance from the south side was displaced onto west side of avant-corps. Interesting facts In the 1860s the renaissance polychromes from the 16th century were discovered in mansion house, located in dining room hidden under the thick layer of plaster. Unique and one of its kind in the region, compared to the Wawel‚Äôs polychromes, those in Pabianice feature floral ornaments. To attract tourists, it is planned to reconstruct the polychromes by contemporary artist. Moreover, the authorities of the Museum decided to reveal other polychromes painted by the artist Jan Szulc whose artistic creation was related with cities such as ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Pabianice. This late polychromes are dated on 1917 and were painted on four walls of north-east alcove inside the castle.

On February 10, Attorney General Robert Abrams ruled that Ruiz's seat was vacant and ordered to withhold the payment of Ruiz's State Senate salary.

A deficit of more than ¬£200 million is forecast for the county by 2018. History From 1947 to 1974 NHS services in Staffordshire were managed by the Birmingham Regional Hospital Board. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. Staffordshire still came under the Birmingham RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Staffordshire came under the West Midlands Regional Health Authority. From 1974 there was an area health authority covering the county. There were three district health authorities, covering South-East Staffordshire, Mid- Staffordshire and North Staffordshire. In 1993 Mid-Staffordshire was merged into South Staffordshire. Four primary care trusts established in the county in 2002: Newcastle-under-Lyme PCT, Staffordshire Moorlands PCT, Stoke-on-Trent PCT and South Staffordshire PCT. Newcastle-under-Lyme and Staffordshire Moorlands were merged into North Staffordshire PCT in 2006. They were managed by the Shropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority which was merged into NHS West Midlands in 2006. Management consultancy KPMG produced a report on the local health economy in March 2015 for the NHS Trust Development Authority, NHS England and Monitor which criticised the lack of collaboration between different organisations in the county. They said the health system was in ‚Äúperpetual crisis mode‚Äù with a lack of clinical leaders and a managerially focused leadership with ‚Äúmany examples of silo working‚Äù. They reported that clinical commissioning groups in the county did not collaborate and their plans, including financial contracts, were not aligned with each other or providers. The CCGs of Stafford & Surrounds, Cannock Chase, and South East Staffordshire and Seisdon Peninsula are proposing a virtual merger, in which all operational functions are combined, leaving only the governing bodies separate. Sustainability and transformation plan Staffordshire formed a sustainability and transformation plan area in March 2016 with John MacDonald, the Chair of University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust as its leader Burton Hospital A&E; and Stafford A&E; are likely to be downgraded, and the community hospitals at Longton and Cheadle and Haywood Hospital will lose 167 hospital beds. A Care Quality Commission visit to Stoke found that in the city there was no shared vision for services or evidence of whole system strategic planning and commissioning. So many older people had to stay excessively long in hospital before they could be moved into care. It criticised proposals to close community beds without consulting social care leaders about the impact. Commissioning North Staffordshire Clinical Commissioning Group decided that from October 2015 they would no longer pay for hearing aids for people with mild hearing loss or some people with moderate hearing loss. This will save around ¬£200,000 a year. The decision was accepted by Staffordshire County Council's health scrutiny committee in June 2015. It is expected that the other CCGs in the county will adopt a similar policy. The process was suspended in February 2016 after the collapse of a similar contract in Cambridgeshire. The CCGs in Stoke-on-Trent, North Staffordshire, East Staffordshire, Stafford & Surrounds, Cannock Chase and South East Staffordshire and Seisdon Peninsula agreed to share an accountable officer in August 2017. The North Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent clinical commissioning groups expect a deficit of ¬£27 million in 2018-19. The CCGs in Cannock Chase, South East Staffordshire and Seisdon Peninsula, and Stafford and Surrounds forecast a combined deficit of ¬£29 million. At the same time the University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust expects a deficit of ¬£40 million, and there are financial disputes between the trust and the CCGs. Both CCGs were rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission in 2019. Primary care Out- of-hours services are provided by Staffordshire Doctors Urgent Care, which is part of Vocare. Three quarters of the general practitioners in Stoke on Trent were found to refuse to take on homeless people as patients in both 2016 and 2018. The Sustainability and Transformation Partnership place Amazon Alexa in the homes of 50 patients in 2019 as a trial. They reported being better able to manage their health conditions and lead more independent lives. Acute services Hospital provision in the North of the county is by the University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust which also runs facilities in Stafford. Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is in the South-East of the county, and the South West is served by hospitals in Wolverhampton and Walsall. The four CCGs covering Stafford and Surrounds, Cannock Chase, Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire set up a ten-year contract for cancer services in 2015 with Interserve Investments, University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust and Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust. It is intended that the ¬£690 Million contract would provide a 10% increase in cancer patients being treated without any extra money. The North Midlands Trust withdrew in July 2015 because it expected that costs, particularly for drugs, would rise at a rate above inflation. The arrangement has been criticised as an attempt to privatise the NHS. In June 2015 more than 63,000 people signed a petition against it and presented it to a CCG meeting. Mental health North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust provides mental health services across Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire. Mental health services in the South of the county are provided by South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Children‚Äôs autism service were provided by South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and Midlands Psychology, a social enterprise from 2010 until 2019 when it was moved to Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust after several poor reviews and a report from Healthwatch Staffordshire which said that parents' complaints had been ignored. The clinical commissioning group were said to have provided minimal monitoring and intervention. Community services Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Partnership NHS Trust provides both health and social care community services. North Staffordshire Clinical Commissioning Group was the first in the country to restrict access to NHS funded hearing aids. From September 2015 it will no longer routinely fund hearing aids for patients with hearing loss between 26 and 40 decibels. People with ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù hearing loss between 41-55 decibels will be eligible for an NHS funded hearing aid if they score sufficiently highly in a ‚Äúfunctional impact assessment‚Äù. Virgin Healthcare won a 7-year prime contractor contract worth ¬£270 million for providing long-term and elderly care for about 38,000 people with long term health conditions in East Staffordshire in March 2015. Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which is sub-contracted to Virgin, had to pay ¬£300,000 in VAT at the end of 2016-17 because Virgin cannot recover VAT costs as NHS organisations can. In October 2018, after a prolonged dispute with the CCG, Virgin terminated all the elements of the contract for which it did not itself directly deliver services. The CCG said \\"From May/June 2019 East Staffordshire CCG will enter into contracts for the services terminated by Virgin Care directly with the providers of those services instead of requiring Virgin Care to negotiate sub- contracts for them.‚Äù In April 2019 Virgin gave a 12-month termination notice on the remaining contract because it would have had to subsidise the service by more than ¬£1 million a year. Healthwatch There are two Healthwatch organisations. One in Stoke-on-Trent and one covering the rest of the county. Staffordshire Healthwatch launched a complaints service in February 2015 because its research suggested thousands of people are not lodging complaints when they experience problems in hospitals or GPs surgeries.

It is located in Belgium, in what was the Ypres Salient on the Western Front. History Polygon Wood, near the village of Zonnebeke, was the location of a number of battles during the First World War, beginning in late 1914. It had been held by the Germans since April 1915 but was captured by the Australian 5th Division in the Battle of Polygon Wood, which took place in the period from September to October 1917. Abandoned during the Spring Offensive in March‚ÄìApril 1918, the area was the scene of further fighting in September 1918 when it was seized by the 9th (Scottish) Division. Cemetery The area was originally a German cemetery with over 340 burials. The British established the Polygon Wood Cemetery in August 1917 as a frontline cemetery until it was lost to the Germans in April 1918. It received further interments in September 1918, once it was back in British hands. Designed by Charles Holden, the cemetery contains the remains of 108 soldiers: 57 from New Zealand, 32 British, and 19 unidentified soldiers. A sole German is also buried in the cemetery, the rest having been relocated. There are special memorials to seventeen British soldiers and thirteen New Zealanders who are known to be among those unnamed. Entrance to the Polygon Wood Cemetery Surrounded by a wall, the cemetery is laid out in the shape of a polygon. The path from the road to the main part of the cemetery is bisected by a Cross of Sacrifice. Located on Lange Streve, along the north-east side of Polygon Wood, the Buttes New British Cemetery is nearby, in the wood itself. The entrance to that cemetery is directly across the road from that of the Polygon Wood Cemetery.

Founded in 1979 by Ren√© Barbier III and his wife, Isabelle Meyer, the winery was part of a new wave of \\"Clos\\" wineries that released their first joint 1989 vintage to great acclaim. They have gone on to garner impressive scores by wine critics and have built up one of the most well-known brands in all of Priorat. History left Ren√© Barbier III was descended from a family of French winemakers although he was born in Tarragona and grew up in Catalonia. Coming with his wife Isabelle Meyer and their young children to the Priorat region, he found a promising wine region that had for years been neglected although excellent wines had sometimes appeared such as the seminal 1974 vintage from Cellers de Scala Dei. This wine caught his and others attention and he was eventually able to gather a group to make a single wine together in the same cellar although released under different labels.

Covering , it was the longest RDC service in the United States. The successor to the Western Pacific's Royal Gorge as a secondary supplement to the California Zephyr, the Zephyrette began service on September 15, 1950. Both the existence and western terminus of the route were shaped by the stipulations of regulatory agencies, while the two RDCs the railroad purchased for the train were substantially modified before entering revenue service. The Zephyrette RDCs achieved considerable cost savings over their conventional predecessor and steam locomotives running similar routes, as well as operational advantages related to their quick acceleration and high cruising speeds. However, they were only temporarily able to keep the service profitable, and the train was ultimately discontinued by the Western Pacific on October 2, 1960, just over a decade after its debut.  Background  The Zephyrette replaced the Royal Gorge in Western Pacific's timetable, which was itself a replacement for the Feather River Express. The Royal Gorge had been established as a passenger train secondary to the California Zephyr, and was intended to help facilitate movement of Western Pacific employees as well as mail, food, and other supplies in addition to carrying paying passengers. However, the Royal Gorge struggled financially; as its average daily ridership dropped from approximately 60 to 40 people, it was losing about $2,700 per day, and was on pace to lose $950,000 over the course of a year. In November 1949, after eight months in operation, the Western Pacific decided to discontinue the Royal Gorge. It then notified the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) of its decision before exploring the possibility of transporting its employees by truck or bus instead of by train, which would have cost an estimated $165,000 per year. The discontinuance faced opposition from residents and businesses along the line who appealed to the California Public Utilities Commission and the Governor's office. Ultimately, the ICC granted the Western Pacific's request to discontinue its daily Royal Gorge service with the condition that it be replaced by a route between Oakland and Salt Lake City that operated three times a week.  Planning and preparation  = RDC evaluations and orders = In January 1950, the Western Pacific conducted a ten-day evaluation with a Budd RDC-1 demonstrator in revenue service between Portola, California, and Salt Lake City, a distance of . This test made it one of the first railroads to use an RDC in revenue service. The runs were deemed a success, and they prompted the railroad to place the first order for an RDC from the Budd Company in May 1950, followed by a second purchase in July of that year. The two RDCs purchased were both of the 70-seat RDC-2 variety, and were numbered 375 and 376. The only difference between the RDC-2s that the Western Pacific ordered and the RDC-1 that it tested was that the former had a baggage compartment and 70 seats, while the latter had 90 seats but lacked the baggage section. = Original and modified plans = Originally, the Western Pacific had planned to run a single RDC on a tri- weekly schedule between Stockton, California, and Salt Lake City, a distance of across California, Nevada, and Utah. This essentially constituted the maximum distance for which a single car could provide both eastbound and westbound service three times per week. However, the California Public Utilities Commission stipulated that the new service must extend to Oakland, meaning that the total one-way distance to Salt Lake City would be . This mandate effectively forced the Western Pacific to purchase a second RDC in order to operate the new route three times a week in both directions. It would also give the new Zephyrette service the distinction of being the longest RDC service in the United States. After the railroad took delivery of its second RDC in July 1950, the new cars were evaluated on a variety of test runs in preparation for entering revenue service. = RDC modifications = The Western Pacific's two RDCs also underwent a series of exterior and interior modifications before they entered revenue service. Exterior modifications included the addition of steel pilots (cowcatchers), oscillating \\"Gyralights\\" on the end doors, back-up horns, and roof-mounted illuminated numberboards. Interior upgrades included the installation of a standard Western Pacific road locomotive chair in each RDC cab, an expanded in-car communication system, a women's lavatory, a water cooler, reclining seats for long-distance passengers, eight photomurals depicting scenes along the route, nightlights, and numerous upgrades to the baggage compartment.  Operation  A Western Pacific EMD F3, shown here leading the California Zephyr. An F3 would also occasionally lead the Zephyrette during periods of peak demand. The Western Pacific's Zephyrette consisted of a Budd RDC that was powered by twin inline six General Motors diesel engines, which each produced , and equipped with Allison torque converters. This setup allowed each RDC to cruise at in direct drive and in torque conversion mode during operation. The foam rubber seats in the RDCs were rated as \\"comfortable\\" at speeds up to and the application of disc brakes allowed fully loaded cars to stop from a speed of in . In of testing and evaluation, the Western Pacific determined that its RDCs averaged , which at contemporary diesel prices yielded fuel costs of barely over 3 cents per mile; this compared favorably to the performance of steam locomotives on similar routes, which accrued costs of approximately 22 cents per mile. The new Western Pacific RDC service was dubbed the \\"Zephyrette\\" due to both its supplemental relationship and (thanks to its stainless steel exteriors) visual resemblance to the California Zephyr. After replacing the Royal Gorge in the Western Pacific's timetable, the two Zephyrettes inherited its train numbers: 1 and 2. The inaugural eastbound Zephyrette left Oakland on September 15, 1950, while the first westbound train departed Salt Lake City two days later, on September 17, 1950. The service operated on a tri-weekly schedule, with eastbound trains departing Oakland at 7:57 pm every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday, and their westbound counterparts leaving Salt Lake City at 7:30 am on the same days. Eastbound, the train's running time was 22 hours and 48 minutes, while westbound it was 23 hours and 30 minutes. In total, the Zephyrette route extended for and included 19 scheduled stops, as well as nearly 100 conditional stops. The Zephyrettes lacked the luxurious appointments of the California Zephyr, foregoing foodservice entirely and providing only hot and cooled water for refreshments. Although the RDCs typically ran the route alone, during periods of peak demand the Western Pacific ran them in short trains behind an EMD F3, a water tender, and a baggage car. In October 1950, the railroad had computed the direct operating costs for the Zephyrette RDCs at 71 cents per train-mile, almost half the cost incurred by its conventional predecessor, the Royal Gorge. In addition to their relative economic efficiency, the cars also gained a reputation for reliability: one Western Pacific employee even likened one of the RDCs to \\"a big Buick\\". They also provided numerous advantages over conventional consists, especially in terms of their ability to accelerate quickly and maintain high sustained speeds, which allowed for faster service of the route's conditional stops than had previously been possible. While the Zephyrettes had initially been profitable for the Western Pacific, they did not remain so, with losses of $255,000 in 1959. Western Pacific ended use of the Southern Pacific Railroad's connecting cross-bay ferry between Oakland and San Francisco in early summer 1958, then discontinued the parallel bus connection later in the same summer. The train was scheduled to be discontinued on June 1, 1960, but opposition from residents along the line led to an order from the Interstate Commerce Commission to temporarily delay the train's end. The service was ultimately ended on October 2, 1960.

He resides in Gre√•ker, √òstfold where he also works as a farmer. He is married and has eight children, and twentyfour teen grandchildren as of 2015.  Politics and activism  Kristianslund became the leader of the New Future Coalition Party in 1998, which merged into the Christian Unity Party the same year. He was leader of the new party until 2001, when he was dismissed after a court ruled against his leadership of the party, following an internal conflict since the party's national convention. He founded the more fundamentalist party Christian Future later the same year, which only allowed men and those confessing to Lutheran faith to hold formal posts. He left the party to join the Abortion Opponents' List for the 2005 and 2009 elections, from 2008 as party secretary, alongside figures such as Ludvig Nessa, B√∏rre Knudsen and Per K√∏rner. In 1998 he criticised a sex-information film from the Department of Health as \\"solicitating to adultery\\", and filed charges against Christian Democratic cabinet minister Jon Lilletun. He also filed charges against a children's program by state broadcaster NRK that had arranged a \\"kissing school\\" for children. In 1999 he gathered 6,000 signatures demanding the government to dismiss bishop Rosemarie K√∂hn and capellan Siri Sunde from their positions due to their liberal positions on homosexual relations. The same year he also filed charges of blasphemy against the art exhibition \\"Ecce Homo\\", which displayed photographs by Swedish artist Elisabeth Ohlson imaging Jesus surrounded by gays and lesbians. He participated in the demonstration against Muslim prayer calling in Oslo in 2000, and has expressed fears of a coming \\"religious war\\" in Norway because of increasing numbers of Muslims. Kristianslund appeared in the first season of Fredrik Skavlan's talk-show F√∏rst & sist in 1998. In 2002 he was portrayed with his then-new party in the NRK-documentary \\"Norwegian fundamentalism\\", and was described as Norwegian fundamentalists' \\"most eager spokesman\\".

Hajdecki, 'Die Niederl√§nder in Wien', in: Oud-Holland 23 (1905), pp. 1‚Äì26, 108‚Äì128, 25 (1907), pp. 9‚Äì26 He was still recorded in Vienna in 1726. The date and place of his death are not known. Work =General= Capriccio of a colonnaded courtyard Jacobus Ferdinandus Saey was in his subject matter influenced by his teacher Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg who mainly painted architectural scenes of real and imaginary churches, Renaissance palaces and picture galleries.Jacobus Ferdinandus Saey, A Classical Portico with an Elegant Company Gathered by a Fountain at Sotheby‚Äôs Unlike his master, who occasionally painted the interiors of real existing buildings, Saey mostly concentrated on imaginary structures and outdoor settings with elegant companies congregating in an informal manner. Saey was particularly skilled in the use of perspective and the realistic rendering of different materials, in particular the marble of columns. Characteristics of his work are the recurring checkered floors and his dramatic use of light. He regularly collaborated with other artists including Hieronymus Janssens who painted the staffage in his work.Jacobus Ferdinandus Saey, A Palace Capriccio beside a Fountain with a Soldier and Elegant Figures in the Foreground at Sotheby‚Äôs As Saey rarely, in fact almost never, signed his paintings, it is difficult to differentiate his artistic production from that of two other even rarer Flemish painters who worked in almost exactly the same style: his contemporary Jacob Balthasar Peeters and a pupil of Peeters by the name of Jan Baptist van der Straeten. =Subject matter= The work of Saey seems to draw inspiration from the work of the Italian architectural painter Viviano Codazzi who had been influenced himself by the work of the Flemish and Dutch genre painters active in Rome known as the Bamboccianti who also painted architectural scenes with figures. There are some important differences with the works of these artists. Unlike them, Saey typically depicted imaginary buildings rather than the more realistic architectural or city views of Codazzi and the Bamboccianti. Saey's figures are not the common people of Rome going about their daily business preferred by the Bamboccianti, but rather elegant persons, often wearing exotic garb who are participating in some courtly or artistic activity.Jacob Ferdinand Saeys, A classical portico with an elegant company gathered by a fountain, Lawrence Steigrad Fine Arts Presents Portraits and Other Recent Acquisitions, Lawrence Steigrad Fine Arts, 2007, p. 18 Baroque palace with Hermes delivering a message Some of Saey's architectural scenes appear to represent subjects from mythology or the bible while others may simply represent some entertainment or story involving fantastic figures imagined by the artist.Jakob Ferdinand Saeys, Palastarchitektur bei n√§chtlicher Beleuchtung mit zahlreicher Figurenstaffage at Hampel Fine Art Auctions Munich For example, his Baroque palace with Hermes delivering a message (at Dorotheum sale of 12 December 2011, Vienna, lot 25) depicts a mythological scene while his Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (Lempertz sale of 20 May 2017, Cologne, lot 1103) depicts a biblical scene.Jacob Ferdinand Saeys, Baroque palace in a wide park landscape, in the foreground the messenger of the gods, Hermes delivering a message at DorotheumAttributed to Jacobus Ferdinandus Saey, Solomon and the Queen of Sheba at Lempertz Some works appear to be related to the extraordinary events in the life of Cleopatra. This could be the case with the Picnic in a palace courtyard (At Jean Moust in 2018), which possibly depicts a picnic of Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Other works, such as the Perspective view of an Italian palace animated with figures and gallant celebrations' (possibly 1690, Musee des beaux-arts de Valenciennes), do not appear to depict a specific story. The picture shows elegant figures on a terrace before a palatial building watching a dance performance by a black dancer holding a red macaw with open wings on his arm. He holds two dogs on a leash who appear to be running in step. Two musicians are playing string instruments on the terrace on the right while the spectators are sitting underneath a balustrade on the right.J√∫nia Ferreira Furtado, Sons, formas, cores e movimentos na modernidade Atl√¢ntica: Europa, Am√©ricas e √Åfrica, Annablume Editora, 2008, p. 265 File:Jacobus Ferdinandus Saey (Attr.) - Palace architecture with nocturnal illumination and numerous figures1.jpeg File:Jacobus Ferdinandus Saey (Attr.) - Palace architecture with nocturnal illumination and numerous figures2.jpg That his works are principally aimed at impressing the viewer through their technical feats of architectural perspective, the dramatic lighting and the mysterious scenes with fantastic figures is evident in the pair of paintings depicting palace architecture with nocturnal illumination and numerous figures (Auctioned at Hampel on 28 September 2017, Cologne, lot 739). Both compositions in large format (119 x 147 cm) depict a monumental portico in front of which an elegant company is gathered. They were designed as counterparts to be displayed side by side. The extremely lavish palace architectures are placed respectively on the left and right in each composition and disappear in the distance with foreshortening at the rear. The round fluted columns in stained marble with various capitals, cornices and balconies are illuminated by artificial light emanating from torches, which are held by stone statues and vases as well as persons holding lighted torches. The scene in the composition to be hung on the left may refer to the story of the arrival of the Queen of Sheba who is standing with her crown on the stairs while servants are carrying luggage and treasure boxes. The meaning of the second work is not yet understood. A composition by Saeys in the collection of the Louvre referred to as the Hunting meal differs from his other work in that it depicts an elegant company in a landscape rather than in front of an imaginary palace.

F. Douglas House is a historic house on United States Route 2/Maine State Route 8 in Norridgewock, Maine. The house, designed by local architect Charles F. Douglas for his family, was built in 1868, and is one of the region's finest examples of Italianate architecture, with ornate trim and a prominent three-story square tower. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Douglas house is a two-story wood frame structure, finished with a gable roof, two interior brick chimneys, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. There are two main entrances to the house, one in an asymmetrically placed three-story tower on the east side of the building, and another on the south side of the house, facing the driveway. The two entrances are connected by a single-story wraparound porch supported by groups of ornately decorated square columns. Roof lines of the porch, main roof, and tower roof are dentillated and bracketed. Fenestration in the tower includes typically Italianate round-arch windows, including paired ones on each side at the top stage. The property includes a two-story carriage barn which has similar decorative style. Charles F. Douglas was born in Brunswick, Maine, and was self-taught as an architect, opening a practice in Skowhegan in the 1860s. He designed this house for his family, and built it in 1868 on land belonging to his wife's family in Norridgewock. They lost the house to foreclosure the following year, and moved to Lewiston, where Douglas did some of his finest works, including Lewiston's Continental Mill. This house is a remarkably sophisticated expression of the Italianate style for a rural inland community in Maine; such buildings are more commonly found in coastal communities.

Retrieved 1 February 2015 > \\"In between sets he threw up blood on a cot. He lay on the cot and he puked > blood. He had bad lungs and he chain-smoked.

(Interesting technique)...Then I would sit down and put > them together as one to create the musical composition.\\" The band was signed by Mike Curb of MGM Records to the company's subsidiary label, Flick Disc, and the album was co-produced by Fowley and by Curb's 19-year-old proteg√© Michael Lloyd, a founder member of the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band who later became the producer of the Osmonds, Shaun Cassidy, and the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. Baxter said: \\"I always got the impression from Michael Lloyd that... there was a separate agenda that we were not privy to.... Our music was compromised... and our album twisted into a bizarre Kim Fowley project. In my heart, I knew it was nothing like the album I hoped it would be. We went forward in good faith, but I am sure the other guys felt disappointed as well.\\" Fowley said of the album: \\"What a record! I have people come up to me and cry and stuff when I go to Europe. They cry and they start shaking and stuff. That‚Äôs the way people respond to that record... It‚Äôs a great record. There‚Äôs only a handful of records that I‚Äôve made that are great.\\" Shortly after the album was released in 1968, Shel Scott and Bill Kirkland both left the band, and were briefly replaced by Bob Desimone (drums) and Brad Delavalley (guitar). However, musical differences between Bissot, Baxter and Sabino soon led to the band's disintegration and no further recordings were released. Bissot retained the rights to the band name.Liner notes to St. John Green reissue CD, Relics Records The album was reissued on CD by Relics Records in the UK in 2014.

Re-created by Chirantan Bhatt, the song is sung by Nikhil D'Souza, with lyrics by Manoj Yadav. The music video of this solo track features actors Shiv Panditt and Aditi Rao Hydari. A duet version of the same song was released as part of the film soundtrack, which was rendered by Arijit Singh and Neeti Mohan. This version is picturised on Akshay Kumar and Sonakshi Sinha. The song was originally composed by Kalyanji‚ÄìAnandji, with lyrics by Indeevar and sung by Manhar Udhas and Sadhana Sargam for 1986 Bollywood film Janbaaz. The original version is picturised on Feroz Khan and Sridevi.  Background  Akshay Kumar suggested to shoot the duet version of the song in a Feroz Khan style. Kumar appears in the version along with Sonakshi Sinha. The song is re-adapted from the track of the same name in 1986 Bollywood film Janbaaz which is picturised on Feroz Khan and Sridevi. The original version penned by Indeevar was sung by Manhar Udhas and Sadhana Sargam and was composed by music director duo Kalyanji‚ÄìAnandji. The renewed version of the song, re-mixed by Chirantan Bhatt has Shiv Panditt and Aditi Rao Hydari in the video. It has been extensively shot in Delhi and Pattaya. The song is directed by Anthony D'Souza while cinematography is carried by Laxman Utekar. In the song Rao is presented in a bikini for which she responds; \\"I knew that my bikini shoot will never look cheap but pretty and sensual instead. That is a huge plus that I was riding on\\". Rao chose the song as the best track from the film. On 2 October 2013, it was revealed that another version of the track \\"Har Kisi Ko\\" will be released as a promotional song which will be featured on Akshay Kumar and Sonakshi Sinha. Kumar and Sinha had earlier collaborated in films like Rowdy Rathore (2012), Joker (2012) and Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! (2013). In the duet version of the song Sinha is appeared wearing a white and a red saree while Kumar dons a cowboy style. They were seen romancing in a farm and shows a glimpse of Kumar wrestling a horse. Regarding the song, Kumar said; \\"I consider Feroz Khan to be the boss of coolness and style. I hope I have been able to do justice to his personality\\". The duet version was shot by the suggestion of Kumar since it was a song from a Khan film, Kumar felt that they should shoot it like he would have. The version was choreographed by Ahmed Khan. Accordingly, he \\"wanted a lot of flamboyance to come across, which Feroz Khan was famous for\\". Moreover, he needed the version to be as different from the other songs in the film. According to Sinha, \\"Nobody can recreate the kind of magic that [Sri Devi] did in that song\\". For the version Kumar requested producer of the film, Ashwin Varde for ten white horses to be appeared in the song but completed the shoot with five of them. Kumar picked the song as one of his favourite tracks from the album along with the song \\"Pitah Se Hai Naam Tera\\".  Release and response  Both versions of \\"Har Kisi Ko\\" was released digitally as a part of the soundtrack of film on 9 September 2013. The music video of the solo version of the song was officially released on 13 September 2013, through the YouTube channel of T-Series, while the music video for the duet version was released on 2 October 2013 through the same platform.  Critical reception  Both version of \\"Har Kisi Ko\\" received mixed to negative response from music critics, due to the comparison between the composition and lyrics from the original to the re-created version. Joginder Tuteja writing for Rediff.com was satisfied with the composition by Chirantan Bhatt. Giving its due credits, Tuteja stated; \\"The musical team does well in creating the kind of sound which is not like umpteen remixes or re-arranged versions that flood the music stands\\". Writing for Koimoi, Mohar Basu was less enthusiastic about the song than the general consensus. Calling the song \\"an offensive gesture\\", Basu was disappointed \\"when young musicians rehash older tracks to make an entirely distorted version of it\\". Similarly, Bryan Durham from The Times of India felt the song is \\"average\\" compared to the original. Bollywood Hungama's Rajiv Vijayakar analysed that \\"Manoj Yadav's lyrics are not a patch on Indeevar's brilliant verse, and D'Souza's gasping, very Western rendition is also not in sync with the basic melody\\". = Solo version = Joginder Tuteja writing for Rediff.com felt the version \\"leaves an impact\\" with the company of both vocalists. Same as for the solo version, Bollywood Hungama's Rajiv Vijayakar panned the version calling it \\"equally undistinguished\\" and criticising the \\"gimmicky high-pitched vocals\\". He further elaborated: \\"Every composition needs a specific octave and this is a classic example of a song pitched in the wrong scale\\". Bryan Durham from The Times of India not impressed about the song concluded that the version is better than solo version. Writing for Koimoi, Mohar Basu thought \\"Though singer Arijit Singh [is] first rate at [his] job, the lack of creativity in making something new is unimpressive\\".

Built in 1910 to a design by Boston architect Guy Lowell, it is one of a small number of summer houses to escape Bar Harbor's devastating 1947 fire, which resulted in the destruction of many such buildings. It is an architecturally sophisticated expression of Beaux Arts and Mediterranean Revival styles, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history Eegonos is set on the shore of Frenchman Bay, about north of Bar Harbor's center. It is a 2-1/2 story H-shaped structure, with a central block flanked by projecting sections on each side. The southeastern section has a single-story porch, supported by paired Ionic columns, extending across much of its width. The building is of masonry construction with a stucco finish, and is topped by a red tile roof. The roofs of the side sections are hipped, while the central section has a side-gable roof pierced by four hip-roof dormers on both the land and ocean sides. The interiors are elegantly appointed, with a marble- floored vestibule, fireplaces finished in marble and wood, and ceilings with decorative friezes and medallions. The building has seen only modest alterations since its construction. The first summer house built on this property was called \\"Sonogee\\", and was destroyed by fire within two years of its construction. Mr. and Mrs. Walter G. Ladd commissioned the noted Boston architect Guy Lowell to design the present building, which was completed in 1910. They called it \\"Eegonos\\", reversing the spelling of the previously named estate. The property was described in an architectural journal in 1910, along with another Lowell commission, Eden Hall, a performance hall in Bar Harbor which burned down in the 1947 fire. The house remained in the Ladd family until 1949, and was used as dormitory housing for a French language school from 1959 to 1975.

She is the holder of the Koestler Chair of Parapsychology at the University of Edinburgh. She is a past president of the Parapsychological Association. She is an author of several papers and books on parapsychology and runs an online course that helps educate the public about what parapsychology is and to think critically about paranormal claims. Biography Watt was born in Perthshire, Scotland in 1962. She graduated with a MA in psychology from the University of St Andrews in 1984, and is a founding member of the University of Edinburgh's Koestler Parapsychology Unit, for which she was recruited as a research assistant in 1986. She obtained a PhD in psychology in 1993, supervised by the parapsychologist Robert L. Morris. Watt continued working at the Koestler Parapsychology unit as a research fellow until 2006, when she was appointed as senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Edinburgh. She has also been Perrot-Warrick Senior Researcher since 2010, and in 2016 she took up the new position as second Koestler Chair of Parapsychology at the university. Watt coauthored the fifth edition of ‚ÄúAn Introduction to Parapsychology‚Äù, published in 2007, which as of 2010 was the most frequently adopted text by those presenting academic courses on parapsychology and anomalistic psychology. In 2016, Watt authored \\"Parapsychology: A Beginner's Guide\\". Near-death studies With neuroscientist Dean Mobbs, in 2011, Watt published a paper on the near-death experience in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences. The paper explains how many common attributes of a near-death experience (an awareness of being dead, out-of-body experiences, seeing a tunnel of light, meeting dead people and a feeling of well-being) have medical or scientific explanations. An awareness of being dead is known as Cotard delusion and is attributed to a brain malfunction with possible causes such as brain tumour, depression or migraine headaches. The paper suggests \\"that out of-body experiences result from a failure to integrate multi-sensory information from one‚Äôs body, which results in the disruption of the phenomenological elements of self-representation.\\" Seeing a tunnel of light can be caused by a degradation of peripheral vision brought on by extreme fear or hypoxia of the eye. The experience of meeting dead people can be brought on by a number of conditions, such as dopamine malfunction or a macular degeneration such as Charles Bonnet syndrome. A feeling of well-being could be caused by a response from the body's dopamine or endogenous opioid systems. The paper also cites a survey where it was found that approximately half of people reporting a near-death experience where not in danger of dying. In regards to Sam Parnia's near-death research, which had an objective test that involved pictures or figures hidden on shelves where a patient could not see them when lying down, but would be able to see them if having an out-of-body experience, Watt stated, \\"The one ‚Äòverifiable period of conscious awareness‚Äô that Parnia was able to report did not relate to this objective test. Rather, it was a patient giving a supposedly accurate report of events during his resuscitation. He didn't identify the pictures, he described the defibrillator machine noise. But that's not very impressive since many people know what goes on in an emergency room setting from seeing recreations on television.\\" Eye movement and lying In 2011, Watt was part of a group, along with Richard Wiseman, that published research into the connection between eye movements and telling lies. The research, which was widely reported in the media, found no evidence that eye movements can be used to determine if someone is lying. Reading eye movements is part of neuro- linguistic programming (NLP), as according to NLP, people move their eyes in different directions when recalling information compared to when constructing information, i.e., lying. Watt said, \\"A large percentage of the public believes that certain eye movements are a sign of lying, and this idea is even taught in organisational training courses. Our research provides no support for the idea and so suggests that it is time to abandon this approach to detecting deceit.\\" Selected publications *Pluviano, S, Watt, C, Della Sala, S. (2017).

History The foundation of the church dates back to 6th century at the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian (527‚Äì565 AD). Justinian erected the church in memory of his mother. The present building dates from the 10th century or according to another source 13th century, during the time of the Despotate of Epirus. The church retained a fragment of the True Cross due to a donation by the Byzantine Emperor. According to another tradition, the Byzantine Emperor donated the miracle- working icon of the Virgin, known as \\"Labovitissa\\" ().Eade, Katiƒá, 2014, p. 104 Until 1967, it was a pilgrimage destination for the surrounding Christian communities.Eade, Katiƒá, 2014, p. 105 Each year on the day of the Dorminition of the Theotokos a procession of the Holy Cross fragment with the Labovitissa icon took place to the adjacent villages. In 1967, religious activities were forbidden by the atheistic policies of the People's Republic of Albania. Recently a number of initiatives to revive such festivities had limited results.Eade, Katiƒá, 2014, p. 117: \\" ...kept in labova's church, to a number of local villages ‚Äì a tradition that is said to have persisted until 1967. However, the church's feast day and pilgrimage is nowadays but a shadow of its past.\\" The relic was lost in 1989. According to claims in the Albanian press it was stolen by the daughter of Enver Hohxa former head of the People's Republic of Albania. The church has been declared a Cultural Monument of Albania. Today, it's considered one of the most significant examples of Byzantine architecture in Albania. Architecture The church shares a number of typical features of 9th‚Äì11th century Byzantine architecture. The connection of the central aisle to the subsidiary aisles as well as the narthex is ensured through a triple passage (tribilon). Several architectural elements found at the exterior of the building, such as the dome, the windows and the combination of brick- and stonework, are influenced from contemporary Byzantine churches in western Macedonia. The 10th century dome is the oldest example of circular dome found in the region of Epirus, probably an evolution of the older octagonical style. The fishbone pattern of the exterior is also found in a number of contemporary church buildings in Epirus, western Macedonia and Lakonia, in Greece, although not a quite common feature in Byzantine architecture in general.Veikou, 2012, p. 127: The fishbone pattern, although not very common during the middle Byzantine period, is also found in buildings throughout Epirus, Western Greek Macedonia and Lakonia.

The TMSR-500 is a \\"Thorium Molten Salt Reactor\\" nuclear power plant being designed for the Indonesia market by ThorCon. The TMSR-500 is based on a small modular reactor (SMR) that employs molten salt technology. The reactor design is based on the Denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR) design from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and employs liquid fuel, rather than a conventional solid fuel. The liquid contains the nuclear fuel and serves as primary coolant. ThorCon plans to manufacture the complete power plants cheaply in shipyards employing modern shipbuilding construction techniques. TMSR-500 Design ThorCon proposed to use modular shipbuilding production processes in a shipyard to build each TMSR-500 as a completed power station. The TMSR-500 would then be floated and towed on the ocean to the installation site where the walls would be filled with concrete or sand as ballast and shielding. Notably the setup of rebar is not required in this process as steel plate construction provides the concrete reinforcement and is integral to the hull design. The power plant consists of a nuclear fission section and a steam/electrical section. The fission section of the plant consists of two power modules, each with two siloed reactor units of which only one is active at any time. The operational reactor units each generate 557 MW (thermal) yielding 250 MW (electric). This means the overall plant with two active reactors can yield 500 MW (electric). Each reactor unit operates for four years, cools for four years, and is then replaced. Such retired reactors use passive cooling to remove decay heat until they are cool enough to be replacement. Any fuel recycling would occur offsite. The reactors operate at near-ambient pressure reducing steel requirements by 50% and concrete requirements by 80% versus a conventional nuclear plant. Little of the concrete must be reinforced. In the event of a reactor overheating thermal expansion of the salt stops the fission reaction and if necessary triggers freeze valves to drain the reactor and separating the fuel from the moderator. Hazardous fission products iodine-131, cesium-137 and strontium-90 are chemically bound in the reactor salt preventing their release. The steam/electrical section features the same design and cost ($700/kw) of a 500 MWe coal plant. A 1 GWe nuclear component requires less than 400 tons of supercritical alloys and other exotic materials. The TMSR-500 only requires as much steel as a medium size, 125,000 dwt Suezmax tanker.  Fuel  In addition to (low cost) thorium, a 1 GWe reactor initially requires 3,156 kg of 20% low enriched uranium along with 11 kg per day of operation. Every 8 years the fuel must be changed out. At a yellowcake cost of $66/kg, a $7.50 conversion cost and $90 per separative work unit, the levelized fuel cost is 0.53 cents per kilowatt-hour.  Waste product  Every 8 years 160 tons of spent fuel travel to the recycling facility, consisting of about 75% thorium, with 95% of the balance uranium. Without separation (other than removing the salt), the total fuel waste stream averages about 2 m3 per year. Reviews A 2017 study by the Energy Innovation Reform Project looked at the TMSR-500 and concluded that \\"if power plants featuring these technologies are able to produce electricity at the average LCOE price projected here (much less the low-end estimate), it would have a significant impact on electricity markets.\\".

Kok means language and borok means people (the people who speak Kokborok). Kokborok is one of the Tibeto-Burman languages widely spoken in the Northeastern part of India in the state of Tripura and neighbouring CHT hill tracts of Bangladesh.

After time spent as a student at Duke University and St. Petersburg State University, he obtained a Master's degree in sociology, Eastern European history and American Studies from Erlangen-Nuremberg University.

In 2003, he finished a binational PhD in (linguistic) discourse analysis (University of East Paris) and sociology (University of Magdeburg). From 2009 to 2012, he taught as a Professor (W1) of the Sociology of Higher Education at Mainz University (Germany). In 2012, he was appointed (Research) Professor of Discourse at the Centre for Applied Linguistics at Warwick, near Coventry (UK). Warwick University is in Coventry, between London and Birmingham (UK). He also joined the Centre d'Etude des Mouvements Sociaux at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris. His name then lost the umlaut but older publications are still signed \\"Angerm√ºller\\". He has been at Open University (Milton Keynes, UK) as Professor of Discourse, Languages and Applied Linguistics since 2019.  Academic work  Having a background in linguistics and sociology, Angermuller is known for his work in Discourse Studies and poststructuralism. His research interests centre on the discursive construction of social order. His methodological focus is on the social effects of language in use. While addressing questions of power, knowledge and social change, he has pursued research on academic, educational as well as political discourses. Trained in German sociology, French linguistic discourse analysis and the qualitative traditions of German and North American social sciences, he specialises in enunciative pragmatics as a linguistic approach to subjectivity in language. In his studies of academic and political discourses, he perceives discourse as a positioning practice contributing to the construction of social order. He was the Principal Investigator of the ERC DISCONEX and INTAC research teams investigating the positioning practices and cultures of researchers in the social sciences and humanities in the U.S., France, Germany and the UK. Angermuller coordinates DiscourseNet, an interdisciplinary and international network of discourse researchers, which became \\"DiscourseNet. International Association for Discourse Studies\\" in 2019 and elected Angermuller as its founding president. With Daniel Wrana, he set up the multilingual Web portal Discourseanalysis.net. With Martin Nonhoff, he launched the Gradnet graduate conferences at Erlangen in 1999.

He also participated in Neuk√∂lln Unlimited (2010), a German documentary about immigrant youth living in a neglected urban area in Berlin, Germany. Early life Akkouch was born in Lebanon. He was two years old when he fled with his family to the Neuk√∂lln district of Berlin, Germany. In Germany, the family has been threatened by ongoing deportations. Three years of this event (2006‚Äì2009) are described in the documentary Neuk√∂lln Unlimited by Agostino Imondi and Dietmar Ratsch. As a teenager, Akkouch became more and more interested in dance and drama, and participated in successful pieces such as Scratch Neuk√∂lln of Macras at HAU, There Was A Time by Niels Robitzky and Magnifico by Andre Heller. He completed his education at the Otto Falckenberg school in Munich, and during his studies he worked in various theatre, film, and television productions, and was intensively engaged in dance, acrobatics and theater work. Since 2009, he has been a part of the dance crew of Fanatix, one of the best dance groups in Germany. He represents numerous theater productions in Berlin and Munich on stage, including at HAU, the Ballhaus Naunynstra√üe, the Maxim Gorki Theater and the Munich Kammerspielen. Film career Tatort In an April 3, 2013 episode of Tatort (the long-running German language television crime drama series), Akkouch plays the role of Tarek Birol. In this episode, the four-member \\"Tatort\\" team determines in the case of a 16-year-old high school student who is found dead in Phoenix Lake. The first two episodes generated great audience interest and made for wider discussion. Neukolln Unlimited Neuk√∂lln Unlimited is a 2010 German documentary co-produced by the German broadcaster RBB in collaboration with the Franco-German cultural channel Arte. Financial support for the documentary came from the , DFFF, Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, as well as from MFG Baden-W√ºrttemberg and the MEDIA Programme of the European Union. The film was awarded the Crystal Bear at the Berlinale 2010. The documentary follows the daily lives of three siblings of the Lebanese Akkouch family: Hassan (18), Lial (19), and Maradona (14), who are successful musicians and breakdancers in the Neuk√∂lln district of Berlin. They grow up with a passion for Hip Hop and streetdance, but pressure is put on the two teenagers when a rivalry arises about who should be the family's main breadwinner. In the meantime, Maradona gets himself into more and more trouble until he is suspended from school. He is at a crossroads between his siblings‚Äô ambitious lifestyle and the street life of his friends. However, a surprising qualification for a TV-casting show could prove to be a turning point in his life. If he wins the ‚Ç¨100,000 prize money, he may be the one who saves the family. Neuk√∂lln Unlimited can best be described as a musical film that deals with the topic of integration of immigrant youth living in neglected urban areas. This documentary goes beyond the typical clich√©s about migrants in ‚Äòproblem‚Äô areas to portray the everyday lives of three youths struggling for their family‚Äôs right to stay in Germany. Verbrechen Nach Ferdinand von Schirach In this crime drama, Hassan plays the role of Abbas Fortas. A young woman lies dead on a luxurious hotel bed, slain with a heavy lamp which was resting on one of the nightstands. An envelope with ‚Ç¨500 in cash is left at the scene. One of the wealthiest men in the city gets tangled up in the story, and he finally admits to having had a \\"financial arrangement\\" with the victim. Nevertheless, he insists he has nothing to do with her death ‚Äì he left the hotel long before the discovery of the corpse. A security camera in the hotel garage seems to refute his statement until it is discovered that the camera clock always runs at winter time, and the crime took place in the summer. Awards Crystal Bear at the Berlinale 2010: This prize the jury members are no older than those of the audience. Eleven children and seven teens award the best films with Crystal Bears. Special Mentions are given for outstanding achievements. Two international juries present further prizes in the Generation Kplus and Generation 14plus competition.

The current location of Rawsonville lies mostly under Belleville Lake across Interstate 94 from Willow Run Airport. The village was flooded out in 1925 when the Eastern Michigan Edison Company built the French Landing Dam and Powerhouse on the Huron River. The former community was dedicated as a Michigan State Historic Site on October 27, 1983.  History  In 1800, the first settler Henry Snow came to this location which was original called Snow's Landing. In 1825, Ambline Rawson and his father arrived at the village. The community plat, as Michigan City by Amasah Rawson and two others, was filed on January 7, 1836. On November 14, 1838, The Van Buren post office was moved to Rawsonville and assumed that name. By the Civil War era, the village was doing well with grist mill, saw mill, a stove factory, and a wagon maker. With the building of the railroad, the community was bypassed hurting the industries there. On October 25, 1895, the post office was closed only to reopen on November 20, 1895 only to close again on February 28, 1902. By 1900, there were few residents here. In 1925, a dam was put in place on the Huron River placing most of the village under water of the new Belleville Lake. The only visual sign that a village was here at one time is the historical marker in front of the McDonald's on Rawsonville Road and across from Grove Road.

A daughter of The Derby winner Relko she won once from twelve races in 1976 and 1977. She finished no better than third in four starts as a two-year-old, but showed promising form in the spring of 1977, finishing second in the Pretty Polly Stakes and the Lancashire Oaks. After failing to win in her first nine races she recorded her first and only victory when narrowly winning a poorly contested Irish Oaks in July 1977. She was well beaten in two subsequent races and retired at the end of the year. She made little impression as a broodmare. Background Olwyn was a big, strong bay mare with a small white star bred in the United Kingdom by the Dollanstown Stud. She was sired by Relko, the French-trained winner of the 1963 Epsom Derby. Relko was not a conspicuous success as a sire of winners, although several of his daughters made an impact as broodmares. Olwyn was the second foal of her dam Nantahalah, who, as a descendant of the broodmare Never Again, was related to Al Bahathri and her son Haafhd. As a yearling Olwyn was sent to the sales and was bought for 3,000 guineas by representatives of Souren Vanian, a French-Armenian arms dealer. The filly was sent into training with Ron Boss at his Phoenix Lodge stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Boss had ridden for Noel Murless in the 1950s and then worked as head lad for his fellow Welshman Ifor Lewis before taking out a trainer's license in 1972. Racing career =1976: two-year-old season= Olwyn failed to win in her first three starts, producing her best effort when finishing third to the Queen's colt Card Player over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Despite her unremarkable form the filly was moved up sharply in class for her fourth and final appearance of the season when she was sent to France to contest the Group One Crit√©rium des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 3 October. Ridden by Joe Mercer she started a 59/1 outsider but exceeded expectations as she finished sixth of the fourteen runners, less than six lengths behind the winner Kamicia. =1977: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut Olwyn ran second to the Queen's filly Dunfermline in the Pretty Polly Stakes at Newmarket in April, finishing four lengths behind the winner. After finishing second in the Warwick Oaks, the filly was moved up in class for the 199th running of the Oaks Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse and finished ninth of the thirteen runners behind Dunfermline. When dropped back in class for a maiden race at Bath Racecourse she started odds-on favourite but finished second. In the Lancashire Oaks at Haydock Park Racecourse in July she proved no match for the Peter Walwyn-trained Busaca and was beaten four lengths into second place by the winner who went on to beat Dunfermline in the Yorkshire Oaks. Olwyn was then sent to Ireland for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh on 16 July in which she was ridden by the lightweight jockey John \\"Kipper\\" Lynch. In an eight-runner field described as \\"one of the poorest ever assembled for a classic\\" the Dermot Weld-trained Nanticious was made the 4/6 favourite after beating Busaca on soft ground in the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot. High Charge, who had finished ahead of Olwyn at Epsom was next in the betting on 7/1 ahead of Lady North (fifth in the Irish 1000 Guineas) with Olwyn fourth choice on 11/1. Lynch sent Olwyn into the lead and was never headed: she held on despite hanging to the right in the closing stages to win by a short head and a head from Sassabunda and Nanticious. Olwyn returned to England for the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse in December and finished sixth of the thirteen runners behind Dunfermline and Alleged after behaving poorly before the start. A week later she was ridden by Lester Piggott and started a 22/1 outsider for the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp. She was in contention until the final turn but finished unplaced behind Kamicia. Olwyn was sent to the Newmarket sales in December and was sold for 77,000 guineas. Assessment and awards There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1976: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. Olwyn was not given a rating in either the British or French handicaps. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 106, twenty-four pounds behind their top-rated two-year-old filly Cloonlara: in their annual Racehorses of 1976 they said that she would \\"probably stay 1¬Ωm\\". In 1977 Timeform rated her on 109, twenty-four pounds behind their best three-year-old filly Dunfermline. In the Irish handicap for three-year-olds she was given a rating of 75, five pounds inferior to the top fillies Nanticious and Lady Capulet. Breeding record Olwyn produced at least ten foals and three winner between 1979 and 1990: *Overboard, a bay colt, foaled in 1979, sired by Nonoalco. Ran 27 times: winner. *Okeanos, brown colt, 1981, by Blakeney. Ran 13 times, winner. *Mufrij, brown colt, 1982, by Nureyev. Failed to win in two races. *Ormilia, filly, 1983, by Mill Reef.

In 1923, the Robinsons' daughter Caroline and her husband Samuel Cooke built a house one block away, and converted the original house to apartments. They sold the new house in 1940, and lived in the original house until their deaths. The Cookes' daughter sold the house in 1962, and it has remained outside the family since. The house was built in Queen Anne style with some Eastlake details. The two-story frame house has a steeply pitched hipped roof supported by decorative brackets and pierced by several dormers. A porch wraps around the left corner of the house, and features elaborate posts, brackets, and latticework. The entry hall features a grand Eastlake staircase.

Statue of Charlemagne by Agostino Cornacchini (1725), St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican, Italy Odin sits atop his steed Sleipnir, his ravens Huginn and Muninn and wolves Geri and Freki nearby, by Lorenz Fr√∏lich (1895). It is, however, most probable that this legend is based on an older Chatti legend which states that the god Odin came riding from the Odenberg on his white, eight-legged horse Sleipnir. At every hoof-fall of the horse, a spring arose, such as the Glisborn. For this reason the Chatti held the Glisborn sacred. After the Chatti were Christianised in the 8th Century by Saint Boniface, the legend was changed to the Charlemagne story. Both variants of the legend are \\"supported\\" by a stone with the imprint of a horse's hoof that was embedded in the wall of a church (Karlskirche) in Karlskirchen, a long abandoned village nearby. During the Protestant Reformation in the Landgraviate of Hesse in the year 1526, the church was destroyed because it was also still used for certain pagan practices. Many years later this stone was cemented into the wall that surrounds the St. Margarethen church in Gudensberg, where it can be still seen today.  Water quality  In 2010, the water at Glisborn was found to have a total nitrate content above 50 mg/l, which is the maximum value that is allowed in drink water by German law (Trinkwasserschutzverordnung) and European drinking water quality standards. The Hessian Water Authority have stated that in a study from 1994 it was found that the soil around Glisborn is composed of thick loess deposits in various states of weathering. The high nitrate values are caused by natural loess decomposition and are not due to farming practice.

Its current editor in chief is Cenk Mutluyakalƒ±. As of July 2014, it consisted of 24 pages and its daily circulation was 4700. The newspaper belongs to the Republican Turkish Party (CTP). It is under the United Media Group along with its sister television channel, Kanal Sim. Regarding its political point of view, Mutluyakalƒ± has stated that while it is nominally owned by the CTP and is a \\"side\\" to current events, the newspapers follows an independent line and at times publishes material that is upsetting for the CTP. Its basic political line of thought centers around its struggle for a united Cyprus and an immediate solution for the Cyprus dispute. Mutluyakalƒ± claims that there is no interference or supervision from the party regarding the newspaper's content. Journalist Hasan Hast√ºrer has written that the newspaper differs from other party-owned newspapers in Northern Cyprus and that the journalists do not see themselves as the defenders of the party. Its first issue was published on 12 December 1975. Its first editor in chief was Zihni Durmu≈ü and the early issues of the newspaper included commentaries by prominent figures in the CTP such as Mithat Berberoƒülu, Naci Talat and √ñzker √ñzg√ºr. It was first published as a weekly broadsheet until 16 July 1976, when the publication stopped for two years. On 28 December 1978, the publication resumed as a tabloid, in 1980, the newspaper built its own printing house and on 12 December 1983, the newspaper started being published daily. √ñzker √ñzg√ºr wrote a column titled \\"Babalar\\" (\\"The Fathers\\") on 16 December 1985 in the newspaper, which resulted in Rauf Denkta≈ü suing it for defamation. In December 1987, a court ruling demanded an astronomical amount of 200 million Turkish liras to be paid by the newspaper, upon the newspaper's failure to pay the sum, the police, accompanied by firefighters, came to the newspaper to confiscate its property, only to be met by a crowd of protesters. The resistance in front of the newspaper continued for five days. The sentence of the court was eventually suspended by a higher court, thereby ending the resistance. In the 1990s, the newspaper often documented political scandals and corruption. In 1994, the newspaper was published with its current green logo for the first time. In the late 1990s, the newspaper went through severe financial difficulties, but with its increased popularity with the Annan Plan for Cyprus in 2004, it grew and was reorganized. In 2008, it became a part of the United Media Group and moved to its current modern headquarters.

It was first published in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier on March 3, 1832, and was subsequently revised a number of times by the author. Plot summary The Duc de L'Omelette dies while dining on an ortolan, and finds himself in hell: an apartment filled with various works of art that has a window overlooking a fiery landscape. Face to face with Satan, the Duc manages to avoid damnation by cheating him at a game of cards. Publication history Poe originally titled the story \\"The Duke of L'Omelette\\" when it was published in the March 3, 1832, issue of the Philadelphia Saturday Courier. It was one of four comedic tales Poe published anonymously in that newspaper that year, along with \\"A Tale of Jerusalem\\", \\"A Decided Loss\\" (later renamed \\"Loss of Breath\\"), and \\"The Bargain Lost\\" (later renamed \\"Bon-Bon\\"). The Saturday Courier had previously published Poe's \\"Metzengerstein\\" in January 1832; it was the author's first prose work to appear in print. The five stories were submitted to the Saturday Courier as entries to a writing contest. Though the winner of the $50 prize was Delia Bacon, the editors published Poe's submissions anyway; he was likely never compensated.

The original mixture may either be a natural resource (like ore, oil or sugar cane) or the product of a chemical reaction (like a drug or an organic solvent).  Significance  Separation processes are of great economic importance as they are accounting for 40 ‚Äì 90% of capital and operating costs in industry. The separation processes of mixtures are including besides others washing, extraction, pressing, drying, clarification, evaporation, crystallization and filtration. Often several separation processes are performed successively. Separation operations are having several different functions: * Purification of raw materials and products and recovery of by-products * Recycling of solvents and unconverted reactants * Removal of contaminants from effluents  Classification  A heterogeneous mixture (e. g. liquid and solid) can be separated by mechanical separation processes like filtration or centrifugation. Homogeneous mixtures can be separated by molecular separation processes; these are either equilibrium-based or rate-controlled. Equilibrium- based processes are operating by the formation of two immiscible phases with different compositions at equilibrium, an example is distillation (in distillation the vapor has another composition than the liquid). Rate- controlled processes are based on different transport rates of compounds through a medium, examples are adsorption, ion exchange or crystallization. Separation of a mixture into two phases can be done by an energy separating agent, a mass separating agent, a barrier or external fields. Energy- separating agents are used for creating a second phase (immiscible of different composition than the first phase), they are the most common techniques used in industry. For example, leads the addition of heat (the separating agent) to a liquid (first phase) to the formation of vapor (second phase). Mass-separating agents are other chemicals. They selectively dissolve or absorb one of the products; they are either a liquid (for sorption, extractive distillation or extraction) or a solid (for adsorption or ion exchange). The use of a barrier which restricts the movement of one compound but not of the other one (semipermeable membranes) is less common; external fields are used just in special applications.

Steamer Enterprise loads cargo onto a Grand Trunk train on the wharf at Jackson's Point. The passenger station at Jackson's Point was a simple affair. Workers and their families pose for a photo while ice cutting at Jackson's Point in 1895. A Grand Trunk train waits in the background. The Lake Simcoe Junction Railway (LSJR) was a short-line narrow gauge railway in Ontario just north of Toronto. It branched off the Toronto and Nipissing Railway at Stouffville and ran north to the town of Sutton and then beyond to the shore of Lake Simcoe where a large wharf was built. The presence of the railway helped the town of Jackson's Point form on the lakeside. The line serviced timber and agricultural shipping, but was more widely used for shipping ice cut from the lake in the winter, and allowing weekend day trips to the lake in the summer. The arrival of the Toronto and York Radial Railway at Sutton in 1908 took most of the summertime passenger business away, and the introduction of refrigeration did the same for the wintertime ice business. Service ended to the Point in September 1927 and the rails were lifted. Service below Sutton continued through a connection to the standard gauge Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), west of the town of Zephyr. It saw some use during the construction of Maple Leaf Gardens three years later, when a spur line was built to a gravel pit a short distance south of Sutton. The entire line closed in 1979 and the rails were lifted in 1981. A portion of the original route was converted, circa 2000, into the Sutton- Zephyr Rail Trail. History =Planning= The late 1800s saw widespread development of railways in southern Ontario as various markets were opened both by the Grand Trunk Railway along Lake Ontario as well as the Trent Canal along the lakes some north of Toronto. A variety of lines linking points on between the two sprung up, looking to cut the route to Toronto as short as possible. None of the lines ran directly to Lake Simcoe, some directly north, and the closest approach so far was made by the Port Whitby and Port Perry Railway, only from Toronto but further along the Canal and a much longer route overall. Plans to reach Lake Simcoe were greatly aided by the construction of the Toronto and Nipissing (T&N;) that was aiming ultimately to run around the eastern side of the lake towards the interprovincial lines outside of North Bay, far to the north. The T&N; reached Stouffville in 1871 and pushed on a few more miles to Uxbridge by the end of the year. In the early 1870s, businessmen in the Sutton area, about north of Toronto, began talks with the T&N; about a branch line. The Lake Simcoe Junction Railway was chartered on 29 March 1873, with plans to branch off the T&N; on the north side of Stouffville and run north for Sutton while the original T&N; continued north-east. The T&N; was built by Francis Shanly, a strong supporter of gauge railways. Most Ontario railways of that era were built at Provincial gauge, , because such lines were backed by provincial grants. However, the narrow gauge was far less expensive to build and Shanly had been using it on a growing network of lines in the Toronto area. He agreed to design and build the LSJR for $290,000, and an initial agreement with T&N; was signed on 1 December 1874 to provide rolling stock and operate the line for 25 years in exchange for 25% of the receipts, although this was not finally ratified until 19 October 1876. The LSJR would later receive $2,000 per mile from the provincial government in spite of using narrow gauge, about of the total construction costs. =Construction and early operations= Shanly surveyed the line in 1875, but construction was delayed by the lack of a final agreement with the T&N.; Construction began in early 1877 with grading all the way to Sutton, and the first rail was laid at Stouffville on 18 June 1877. The line was built from 40-pound rail imported from England. The bush cut for the line was stacked and burned, heating nearby rails to the point that the crews would roast crows on them for food. The line was completed and opened for business on 1 October 1877. The line was mostly served by whistle stops consisting of lean-tos with green flags that would be displayed to call for a stop. A large wharf was built on the lakeshore in 1879, giving rise to the village of Jackson's Point. The main services for the LSJR were summertime passengers visiting the beaches to the west, and a major wintertime service shipping cut ice to Toronto. Early service was often disrupted by livestock wandering onto the lines, and upset farmers would retaliate by spreading lard on the rails on uphill sections. By the 1880s there were a large number of lines east of Toronto competing for the same trade. Most of the lines were unprofitable, and the widespread adoption of standard gauge at required expenses the T&N; could not afford. The T&N; sold itself, along with the LSJR, to the Midland Railway of Canada in 1881, who agreed to re-gauge the lines as part of the purchase. =Competition, realignment= The LSJR could not compete with the high-speed service provided by the Radial Railway's electric cars. The Toronto and York Radial Railway (Metropolitan line) ran a radial tram service along Yonge Street from Toronto reaching Sutton in 1906. This provided service to Toronto in about 2¬Ω hours, far faster than the T&N;, causing the LSJR's passenger service to disappear overnight. The arrival of the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) at Pefferlaw only a short distance to the east the same year did the same to much of the secondary agricultural shipping business. The introduction of home refrigeration eliminated the ice shipping business over time. Local service continued, but the wharf on the lake was abandoned on 24 September 1927, and the lines between there and Sutton were lifted in 1929. Mixed passenger/freight service ended on 19 May 1928. The new CNoR line ran across the LSJR almost exactly at its midpoint, where the two lines paralleled each other for some distance near the town of Mount Albert. In 1928 the LSJR was connected to the CNoR about west of the town of Zephyr, just north of Mount Albert. A short connection running east off the original LSJR alignment connected to the CNoR in a large wye known as Zephyr Junction. Toronto access was now provided by the CNoR line. The section south from Zephyr Junction to Ballantrae was lifted between the 12th and 25 October 1928, the rest of the original alignment from Ballantrae to Stouffville operated as a spur until it was lifted in 1930. A spur off the remaining northern section of the line was opened to a gravel yard near Sutton, which saw significant use during the construction of Maple Leaf Gardens, starting in 1931. =Abandonment= On 1 January 1884, the entire Midland was leased to the Grand Trunk Railway. They operated the LSJR with Grand Trunk rolling stock. Their bankruptcy in 1919 and following nationalization into the Canadian National Railway (CN) crown corporation in 1923 began a process that led to the CNoR's line becoming the north-south CN mainline. The mainline was reorganized and renamed several times before eventually becoming the Bala Subdivision, while the LSJR was known as the Sutton Subdivision throughout. The LSJR was downgraded from a Subdivision to a Spur with the 30 October 1960 CN timetable updates. With the ending of tight regulation of the railways, many smaller lines were abandoned. This included the 13 August 1979 abandonment of the remaining of the LSJR. The rails were lifted starting on 14 July 1981. The later abandonment of this section left it in a state of good repair for conversion to rail trail use. This is now known as the Sutton-Zephyr Rail Trail, ending just off the T&N; lines at Zephyr Junction.\\"Sutton Zephyr Rail Trail\\" , Town of East Gwillimbury. Route The LSJR can be seen, dashed right of center, on this map of the North Simcoe Railway. The LSJR split off of the T&N; just north of the station in Stouffville, used today for GO Transit service to Toronto. It ran north-west for about to a point just south of the Vandorf Sideroad, before turning northward to pass through the western side of Ballantrae. From there it ran north, paralleling the modern Ontario Highway 48, passing on the west side of Mount Albert, Baldwin and then into Sutton and Jackson's Point on the lakeshore. A large wye was constructed on the south west side of Sutton for turning the trains around. The connection to the CNoR lines was a somewhat smaller wye at Zephyr Junction, at the corner of Zephyr Road and York-Durham Line.

In 2012, Regan wrote the story and it then took about two years to get the film project started. Before production for the film even began, Regan created a two-minute trailer in hope of selling the project to investors. In December 2013, the campaign for the film was launched, Regan used Kickstarter to generate funds for the film and the film earned $122,000 in donations in less than 40 days. The film cost ¬£124,000 to make. In February 2015, Regan told Asian World News \\"I had some life experience which really affected me. In 2009, the government killed my father.

The film crew is composed of people from diverse backgrounds, religions and ethnicities. City officials in Dearborn Heights were lenient regarding the production of the film, allowing the cast and crew to shoot at several prime locations, including at the Berwyn Senior Citizen Center. Scenes were also shot at the Alsadek Market on Warren Avenue in Dearborn and in and around Downtown Detroit. At the end of June 2014, the production of the film completed in Dearborn Heights after a month-long shoot around Metro Detroit that employed dozens of Muslims and Arab Americans from California, New York and Michigan. On the last day of production at the Berwyn Senior Citizen Center, more than 100 extras turned out, many dressed in Islamic attire, to shoot a scene depicting a homeless shelter being raided by the police.

The film documents the exploitation of garment workers in Bangladesh with the personal stories of three young women working in factories in Dhaka. Summary The filmmakers first introduce a young woman whose husband abandoned her when she was pregnant with her first child. She lives in one room with seven other family members. She and her two sisters, who are also single mothers, work as machinists in the factories. They complain that they are never paid enough or on time; that paychecks are docked; and that overtime is mandatory, but often goes uncompensated. While these women sew clothes for retail giants, their mother cares for their numerous young children. Next, the film focuses on a garment worker in her early 20s whose family sent her from a village to work in the factories when she was nine years old. She lives alone and her monthly wage is $45 US, much less than the monthly cost of living in Bangladesh. After a day at the factory, the woman begins another shift as a volunteer at the union office run by the National Garment Workers Federation (NGWF). Later in the film, there are protests organised by NGWF in Dhaka. Garment workers march through the streets demanding a fair living wage and safe working conditions despite the threat of losing their jobs for participating in the protest. Production and release The Machinists tells the personal stories of three female Dhaka garment workers and the boss of a fledgling trade union in Dhaka, Bangladesh, intersect to portray the human cost of western high street fashion. It has unprecedented access into the garment factories and the lives of ordinary garment workers. The film was commissioned by Al Jazeera International and after a series of international broadcasts, was taken on by a number of international NGOs to promote issues of workers rights in the developing world. On 30 May 2013, Hannan Majid and Richard York held an event in Herringham Hall at Regent's College in London's Inner Circle, to raise money for the National Garment Workers Federation in Bangladesh, which helps victims of the disaster and battles to win better conditions for garment workers.

The film gives voice to three young people working in the factories in Dhaka.\\" Indybay said, \\"This film tells this story through illuminating the lives of these workers and why the recent industrial disasters are a logical result of the corruption and corporate control of the government of Bangladesh.\\" Tears in the Fabric After the 2013 Rana Plaza tragedy, in 2014, Majid and York returned to Bangladesh to make Tears in the Fabric. Since the release of The Machinists, Rainbow Collective has built strong ties with the NGWF, who were instrumental in securing the access and characters for the new film.

His fighter crashed near Raqqa, Syria, on 24 December 2014 during the military intervention against the Islamic State. United States and Jordanian officials said that the crash was caused by mechanical problems, while ISIL claimed that the plane was hit by a heat-seeking missile. ISIL held al-Kasasbeh captive before killing him in early January 2015. It then conducted negotiations with the Jordanian government, claiming it would spare al-Kasabeh's life and free Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in exchange for Sajida al-Rishawi, a woman sentenced to death by Jordan for attempted terrorism and possessing explosives. After the Jordanian government insisted on freeing al-Kasasbeh as part of the deal and showing proof that he was alive before it would exchange al-Rishawi, ISIL released a video on 3 February 2015 showing al-Kasasbeh being burned to death while trapped inside a cage. Al- Kasasbeh's killing provoked widespread outrage in Jordan, and condemnation by leading figures of the Islamic world and subsequently led the Jordanian government to execute two Iraqi militants on death row (including al-Rishawi, who ISIL had requested in exchange for al-Kasasbeh) in retaliation over the killing. In direct military retaliation, King Abdullah ordered Operation Martyr Muath, a series of airstrikes that killed a number of ISIL militants over the course of three days. Personal life Al-Kasasbeh was one of eight children, including an elder brother, Jawdat Safi al-Kasasbeh, born to Issaf and Safi Yousef al-Kasasbeh, a retired education professor, in Al Karak, Jordan. He was a Sunni Muslim. The al-Kasasbehs are a prominent Jordanian family of the influential Sunni Muslim Bararsheh tribe from southern Jordan. His uncle, Fahed al-Kasasbeh, was a Major General in the Royal Jordanian Army. Al-Kasasbeh married engineer Anwar al-Tarawneh in September 2014. Prior to his capture, al-Kasasbeh lived in the village of Ay in the Karak Mountains in Karak Governorate, south of Amman. Career In 2009, al-Kasasbeh graduated from the King Hussein Air College and joined the Royal Jordanian Air Force. He completed his F-16 training in The Royal Jordanian Air Force, followed by training with the Republic of Korea Air Force's 120th Flying Squadron, at Seosan Air Base under a South Korean-Jordanian exchange programme. By 2012 he qualified as an operational F-16 pilot and was assigned to No. 1 Squadron at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base. At the time of his capture, al-Kasasbeh was a first lieutenant. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of captain. Capture A pair of Jordanian F-16s, similar to those operated by al-Kasasbeh, in October 2009 The plane al-Kasasbeh was piloting, a Lockheed Martin F-16 formerly used by the Royal Belgian Air Force, crashed after suffering from mechanical problems on 24 December 2014 during a bombing raid on a brick factory during the military intervention against the Islamic State. The Jordanian government said a technical failure caused him to eject after flying at low altitude, but the Islamic State claimed it shot down his aircraft. He ejected and parachuted into a lake near Raqqa, Syria. He was quickly captured by Islamic State militants and pulled from the water. US officials state they initiated a search and rescue mission, but they did not locate him before he was captured. On 30 December 2014, al-Kasasbeh appeared in a detailed interview with ISIL's Dabiq magazine. Unsuccessful negotiations took place for his release. His family applied pressure on the Jordanian government to arrange for his release. Originally, it was proposed to trade him and a kidnapped Japanese journalist, Kenji Goto, for Sajida al-Rishawi, a failed Iraqi suicide bomber incarcerated in Jordan since she took part in the 2005 Amman hotel bombings, and sentenced to death. The Jordanian government insisted on proof that al- Kasasbeh was still alive before it could proceed with a swap. ISIL refused and published the video of his killing. Some analysts have assessed ISIL's offer of prisoner exchange as a gimmick that was meant to put into disrepute or mock the commitment of the Jordanian government to the military intervention against it. There have also been suggestions that the proposal was a tactic intended to free its valued member in exchange for a corpse. A military operation to free al-Kasasbeh, possibly by Jordanian special forces, may have been made on 1 January 2015. Members of an anti-ISIL group in Raqqa, named Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, said they witnessed coalition jets bombing targets in Raqqa in some of the fiercest strikes of the anti-ISIL campaign, while four helicopters dropped off soldiers wearing purported Jordanian Army uniforms. The mission was aborted when ISIL fighters in the area began firing anti-aircraft missiles at the helicopters, forcing a retreat. Death ISIL supporters used the Arabic hashtag #SuggestAWayToKillTheJordanianPilotPig on Twitter, crowdsourcing and publicizing their execution of al-Kasasbeh. A film released by the group showed al-Kasasbeh was burned to death by ISIL members in January 2015. His killing was recorded on video and shown near the end of a 22-minute \\"snuff film\\" entitled Healing the Believers' Chests, credited to the ISIL official Al Furqan Media Foundation and distributed via a Twitter account known as a source for ISIL propaganda, and on video-sharing sites. The video shows him with a black left eye, first at a table and then confined in a black steel cage outdoors and dressed in an orange jumpsuit, before an ISIL militant set alight a trail doused in gasoline leading towards the cage. He was burned alive while numerous armed ISIL fighters in sand-colored balaclavas and desert camouflage watched on from a distance. A truck finally extinguished the fire by dumping rocks and sand on it. Before he was burned to death, al-Kasasbeh was made to reveal the names and workplaces of a number of his fellow Royal Jordanian Air Force pilots. Their names and photographs were displayed at the end of the video, with an ISIL bounty offer of 100 gold dinars (approximately $20,000) for each Jordanian Air Force pilot killed. Most Western media outlets refused to show the full video, sometimes describing it or showing images immediately preceding al-Kasasbeh's immolation. Fox News posted the complete video on its website. The Jordanian government assessed that al-Kasasbeh was killed by burning on 3 January, rather than 3 February, when the video was released on Twitter. This confirmed that the ISIL never intended to exchange him for al-Rishawi. Other news reports suggest that he may have been killed a few days later, on 8 January, according to a tweet posted by a Syrian activist from Raqqa that day claiming he saw individuals from ISIL celebrating the death of al-Kasasbeh on 8 January. It was reported that al-Kasasbeh was deprived of food beginning five days before he was killed. On 25 February 2015, al-l'tisam, a media arm of ISIL, released a video entitled Message to Jordan. It showed new excerpts from the video of al-Kasasbeh's burning. According to a former ISIL militant, senior ISIL leader Abu Mohammad al-Adnani personally participated in the killing of al- Kasasbeh.http://english.alarabiya.net/en/media/television-and- radio/2017/02/11/Former-ISIS-militant-reveals-details-on-filming-of-Jordanian- pilot-s-execution.htmlhttps://www.memri.org/tv/people-behind-isis-media- system-speak-al-arabiya-tv-documentary/transcript Reaction Muath al- Kasasbeh's memorial at the University of Jordan. Al-Kasasbeh's killing provoked outrage in Jordan; even some of those who had been opposed to the country's participation in airstrikes against ISIL started demanding revenge. King Abdullah II cut short a visit to the United States, and the Jordanian government announced that all prisoners in its custody who had been convicted of association with ISIL would be executed \\"within hours\\" in retaliation for al-Kasasbeh's killing. In further response, Mamdouh al-Ameri, a Jordanian military spokesman, said: \\"While the military forces mourn the martyr, they emphasize his blood will not be shed in vain. The revenge will be as big as the calamity that has hit Jordan.\\" On 4 February 2015, al-Rishawi and another Iraqi jihadist who was also on death row, Ziad Khalaf al-Karbouly, were executed by hanging in Swaqa Prison, expedited in response to al-Kasasbeh's death. Later on 4 February, Jordan launched its first military response to al- Kasasbeh's killing. Jordanian warplanes bombed ISIL positions in Mosul, killing 55 ISIL fighters, including a senior commander. The following day, Jordan launched airstrikes against ISIL weapons and ammunition warehouses and training camps. According to U.S. officials, the attacks took place near Raqqa and involved 20 Jordanian F-16s, with American refueling and radio jamming aircraft assisting. After the jets completed their mission, they overflew al- Kasasbeh's hometown of Karak while on their way back to base. The Jordan Radio and Television Corporation aired footage shot prior to those attacks, of pilots scribbling messages onto bombs slated to be used in the strikes. \\"For you, the enemies of Islam,\\" read one message. Others bore verses from the Quran. In 3 days of bombardment, Jordanian fighter jets destroyed 56 ISIL targets and killed dozens of ISIL fighters. Several clerics, leading figures of the Islamic world and news outlets roundly condemned the killing as murder. However, ISIL said it could be justified through Islamic law, despite cremation being illegal per Islamic law. The Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic Action Front, condemned the killing of al-Kasasbeh. Their statement described it as a \\"crime\\", without mentioning ISIL. The IAF's leader, Sheikh Hammam Sa√Ød, in a 5 February interview with Radio Sawa, asked Jordan to withdraw from the anti-ISIL coalition, saying \\"Jordan should not be part of a coalition run by the United States.\\" Sheikh Salam Salameh, a Hamas member of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), said \\"IS members are, in one way or another, considered Muslims and we must not stand with the enemies of Allah against the people of Allah (the IS).\\" He added, \\"Jordan is the reason for al-Kasasbeh having been burned. It was the Jordanian government's decision to send its army into Syria to assist the [Syrian] government against the rebels in their war, in which it [Jordan] has no interest. It should have adopted a similar position to Turkey.\\" References Category:1988 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Foreign hostages in Syria Category:Filmed executions Category:People killed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Category:Royal Jordanian Air Force personnel Category:Jordanian Sunni Muslims Category:People from Al Karak Category:2014 in Syria Category:2015 in Syria Category:People executed by burning Category:Jordanian involvement in the Syrian Civil War ","title":"Muath al-Kasasbeh"},{"id":"45276021","title":"Tears in the Fabric"},{"id":"45276023","title":"Mass E Bhat"},{"id":"45276029","title":"Tanju Miah"},{"id":"45276031","text":"A Kind of English is a 1986 British drama film, directed by Ruhul Amin and written by Paul Hallam.

The platform has a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, it is a social media tool to share wildlife sightings and provide a host of reserve specific information. On the other hand, the platform embraces crowdsourcing and citizen science to generate valuable wildlife sightings data for conservation research. History Development of Tracking the Wild started in Cape Town in early 2012 by husband and wife team John and Natalie White. The company officially launched in February 2014 with their website and Android app followed by the launch of their iPhone app in September 2014. In April 2017 Tracking the Wild was rebuilt and launched as Chirp Birding, a social network designed specifically for the global birding community. Participation The Tracking the Wild platform is based on the crowdsourcing of valuable wildlife sightings by citizen science. Tracking the Wild users submit their wildlife sightings in the form of images and/or video together with a sighting‚Äôs date and time, GPS location and species name. This open data is then incorporated into an online database and shared with wildlife researchers at the University of Cape Town‚Äôs Animal Demography Unit and other accredited conservation organisations. Protection of Endangered Species The platform has been built to exclude rhino sightings and restrict the location information for any species whose safety could be jeopardised by its location being made public. This can be managed on a park-by-park and individual species basis. Protected Areas Covered The Tracking the Wild platform currently covers over 40 national parks, nature reserves and game reserves across South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.

The house was built in the 1830s by brothers John and Archibald Christian, who were among a group of settlers from the Piedmont region of Virginia who came to Tuscumbia in the 1820s and 1830s. The family had left the house by the 1860s, and in the late 19th century, it was the home of Governor Robert B. Lindsay. In the 1900s, the house was the center of a dairy farm, before it and the surrounding 50 acres (20 ha) were acquired by the Tennessee Valley Country Club in 1923. The country club uses the house as a social meeting area and caretaker's quarters. Situated on a hill overlooking Tuscumbia, the house has a double-height portico flanked by six-over-six sash windows on each floor. Twin entrance doors lead into separate front rooms that were a portion of the house as originally built. Each room has an Adamesque mantel. A transverse rear hall was added around 1923, joining the main block with a detached kitchen. The main stairway to the second floor was moved to this hall, replacing separate stairhalls in the front rooms. See also: The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

It was Lewis's first album with the label after leaving Sun Records. Background After his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin Myra and the resulting scandal that ensued when he toured Britain in May 1958, Lewis was blacklisted from radio and his singles flopped. By 1963, he had scored only one minor hit (a cover of the Ray Charles song \\"What'd I Say\\") and, frustrated by what he saw as Sam Phillips's indifference, signed with Smash. The team at Smash (a division of Mercury Records) came up \\"I'm On Fire,\\" a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as Colin Escott writes in the sleeve to the retrospective A Half Century of Hits, \\"Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis‚Äôs comeback hit, and it might have happened if the Beatles hadn‚Äôt arrived in America, changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn‚Äôt really know what to do with Lewis after that.\\" One of Smash's first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, which may have been inspired by the continuing enthusiasm European audiences had shown for Lewis's brand of rock and roll. Recording Although competent, the remakes on The Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis could never measure up to the magic found on his early Sun sides. In his book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, biographer Joe Bonomo writes at length about the album's shortcomings: \\"The results were anemic and odd, even four decades down the line. The opening 25 seconds of 'Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On,' the first number tackled by Jerry Lee at the sessions, reveal the nature of the problem: so crude and essential as recorded by Jack Clement in 1957, the song is garlanded in Nashville with crispy-EQ'ed hi-hat percussion, an intrusive walking electric bass, and a syncopated rhythm guitar that feels like an annoying kid brother tagging along looking for some hijinks.

For the most part his work was rarely heard in Britain and he is now relatively unknown. In Germany, however, he had a limited but devoted following during his lifetime, and his music is still performed.Roland Bocquet 'Lied an einen gefallenen Freund' . Roland Bocquet - Gesang des Lebens (Concert).  Early life  Roland Bocquet was born Hugh Rowland Bocquet in Saharanpur, India on 3 June 1878. His father was William Sutton Bocquet, a prominent railway engineer, and his mother Jessie van Zuylen of Nyvelt Gasbeke was a Flemish baroness. He was educated in England at Bedford Modern School and after entering the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich seemed destined for an Army career. However, a year after gaining a commission in the Royal Engineers he resigned from the Army and entered the Royal Academy of Music.A. Underwood, The School of the Black and the Red (Revised edn. Bedford, 2010), p. 285.  Career  Bocquet moved to Dresden in 1900 and whilst earning his living as a teacher of Music and Mathematics entered the city's bohemian artistic circle. His compositions date from 1902, writing virtuoso piano pieces and Lieder drawn from the poetry of Baudelaire, Herman Hesse, Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Dauthendey and others. The British composer Arnold Bax who had known Bocquet at the Royal Academy, spent some time with him during a visit to Dresden in 1906 and described him thus: 'Roland Bocquet was the writer of many very skilful but clearly Strauss-derived lieder. Noticeably handsome, black-haired and moustached, blue-eyed, straight of nose and with a peculiarly beautiful speaking voice, he'd been settled in Dresden for some years and spoke German like a native. He took himself rather Byronically, and posed as a blase cynic. In 1913 he toured America accompanied by the opera singer Leon Rains (1870-1954) who performed Bocquet's work. In 1914. however, he was interned at the Ruhleben internment camp in Berlin, created to house non-German subjects during the War. The camp became something of a creative melting-pot due to the large number of artists and musicians, some of them left stranded in Germany whilst visiting Bayreuth in 1914, held prisoner there. Two of Bocquets's best known works Juninacht and Lied an einen gefallenen Freund date from this period.'In Ruhleben Camp' The Hessisches Hauptstaatsarchiv Wiesbaden (Germany) keeps a score of his Ballad No. 1 (Opus 22) as arrangement by Frederick Charles Adler (1889-1959), set for the symphony orchestra of Ruhleben internment Camp.Hessisches Hauptstaatsarchiv Wiesbaden Abt. 3037 Nr. 240.

Das Leben des Dresdner Komponisten Roland Bocquet (1878-1945?), in: Neues Archiv f√ºr S√§chsische Geschichte 86 (2015), S. 145-176 In the 1920s his reputation was consolidated and the Roland Bocquet Society, created in Dresden to encourage the publication and appreciation of his work, flourished. His music was performed at concerts throughout Germany and also in Paris. His Four Songs (Opus 35) was also performed at the Promenade Concerts in London in 1928. His music was again performed in England during BBC Radio broadcasts in 1934 and 1936. In 1936 he was appointed Professor of Music Theory at the Dresden Conservatory.  Later life  From the late 1930s Bocquet becomes an increasingly obscure figure and no new compositions date from this time. He also seems to have developed sympathies for the Nazis, although as he never joined the Party this may not be attributable to a genuine conviction. He remained in Germany during World War II, later removing to Mei√üen and 1954 to Zurich in Switzerland.The Eagle, Magazine of Bedford Modern School, Vol. XXXI(I) No.233, Christmas 1956 He died suddenly from a heart attack at Zurich on 16 October 1956.

It is published by the Institute of History, part of the Centre of Albanological Studies in Tirana, Albania. It is profilized as a bulletin short studies or articles dealing with Albanian history, from antiquity to nowadays. Beside historical thematic, it publishes studies presented in scientific events as conferences and symposiums, archival documents, pieces of historical memoirs and materials, information of scientific activities organized by the Institute of History, etc. It provides information of latest publications of the Albanian Institute of History, both Albanian and foreign albanologists. History The magazine is the first historical one in Albania. It started as Buletini i Institutit t√´ Studimeve (Bulletin of the Institute of Studies), published by the Albanian Institute of History established in 1946, representing the first scientific institute in post World War II Albania. It had separate sections for linguistics, literary studies, and history. After the first issue with this name, it promptly changed to Buletin i Institutit t√´ Shkencave (Bulletin of the Institute of Sciences), published by the Albanian Institute of Science (1948-1957) which had replaced the Institute of Studies. The magazine preserved it previous structure. In 1952, it split in two separate publications: Buletini p√´r Shkencat Natyrore (Bulletin for the Natural Sciences), and Bulletini p√´r Shkencat Shoq√´rore (Bulletin for Social Studies). The later one focused on linguistics, history, archaeology, ethnography, etc. Articles started being accompanied by a resume in French. In 1955, the corresponding sections of social studies merged into the Albanian Institute of History and Linguistics (), which affiliated with the University of Tirana during 1957-1972. During 1957-1964, the magazine came out as Buletin i Universitetit t√´ Tiran√´s - seria shkencat shoq√´rore (Bulletin of the University of Tirana - series on social studies). After 1964, the Institute of History and Linguistics started publishing Studime Historike (one issue every three months), and the other magazine Studime Filologjike (Philological studies). With the establishment of the Albanian Academy of Sciences in 1972, the Institute of History and Linguistics split into the Instituti i Historis√´ (Institute of History) and Instituti i Gjuh√´s dhe Let√´rsis√´ (Institute of Linguistics and Literature) which served as the main institutions of albanology, both affiliated with the Academy of Sciences. Starting from 1973, \\"Studime Historike\\", restarted coming out 4 times per year. In 1979, the Institute of History grew and expanded with additional sections, each focusing on separate periods of history, i.e. sections for Albanian National Awakening, Albania during World War II, Ethnic History, History of Kosovo, etc. Around 35 historians and albanologues contributed during this period. The articles were still accompanied by a resume in French. After 1991, with the fall of communism in Albania, the number of associated staff of the Institute of History decreased significantly. After the issues 3-4 of 1991, \\"Studime Historike\\" stopped publishing for two years. It restarted in 1994 until 1997 once a year, and later twice a year with around 250-300 pages each issue. In 2008, the Institute was disaffiliated with the Albanian Academy of Sciences, joining the Centre of Albanological Studies. It continued with 16 members in 3 departments (Middle Age and National Awakening, post Independence, and Contemporary Studies).

It is named after former United States Congressman from Massachusetts and Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Thomas P. \\"Tip\\" O'Neill Jr. and located at 200 C Street Southwest in the Southwest Federal Center district, at the foot of Capitol Hill. Location The O'Neill building is in the Southwest Federal Center area, which began to take shape in the 1950s as part of an urban renewal project that included destruction of multiple square miles of residences and buildings that were deemed to be run-down. It is flanked by the Hubert H. Humphrey Building, the headquarters of the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Ford House Office Building, which also contains House of Representatives offices. It is adjacent to the Center Leg Freeway of Interstate 395, which separates it from the Rayburn House Office Building. History Federal Building No. 8 in the late stages of construction around 1963 The building was constructed in 1963 as Federal Office Building No. 8 to house laboratories for the Food and Drug Administration, an agency of the neighboring Health and Human Services, located across the street in the Hubert H. Humphrey Building. Starting in 2008, the office building underwent an extensive, $130 million renovation. The building received new green spaces, heating and air conditioning, electrical systems, more glass and numerous energy- and water-saving features, earning it a \\"gold\\" rating under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design system. The House of Representatives voted in 2012 to name the building after O'Neill, after a suggestion by minority leader Nancy Pelosi. The O'Neill building opened for occupancy in 2014. A 2017 law transferred ownership of the building to the Architect of the Capitol, the agency that owns and maintains congressional buildings. It was then given its current name and opened to public access, like the other House and Senate office buildings. Uses The O'Neill building is shared by the House of Representatives and the Department of Health and Human Services. It houses about 2,000 staffers. The House of Representatives is using the building, in part, to temporarily house committee staff who are being displaced by a Cannon House Office Building renovation project due to last until 2025. Health and Human Services uses the structure for its Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, which exists to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies and disasters.

The county acquired the cars to bootstrap a proposed commuter rail service between Los Angeles and Orange County. This effort, spearheaded by County Supervisor Baxter Ward, was unsuccessful. The equipment saw limited use on Amtrak's San Diegan in 1978 and was sold in 1985.  History  The 1970s saw a renewed interest in the United States in commuter rail as rising gas prices, pollution, and traffic congestion made driving less attractive. Local service in Los Angeles had ended on April 8, 1961 when the Pacific Electric discontinued operations. Baxter Ward had been elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 1972 and used his position to push the development of transit in Los Angeles. Ward proposed running a commuter train between Union Station in Los Angeles and Orange County over the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway's Surf Line. Amtrak already operated multiple trains over this route to San Diego (the San Diegan), but the timings were not convenient for commuters. At the time Amtrak was prohibited by statute from operating commuter services. At Ward's urging the Board of Supervisors voted 3‚Äì2 to acquire 1940s railcars from the Oregon, Pacific and Eastern Railway at a cost of $230,000. The county spent an additional $1.8 million to refurbish the equipment. Ward's plan for commuter service in Orange County foundered on opposition from the ATSF, which refused to operate the train and was opposed to any use of its tracks for commuter rail. As an alternative, the county, with support from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), arranged with Amtrak to place the equipment in service between Los Angeles and San Diego, supplementing the existing San Diegan service. The train made its first run on February 14, 1978. Daily ridership was 100, well below expectations. At the conclusion of the trial on August 12 the equipment was withdrawn and replaced by regular Amfleet equipment. Although a failure as a commuter service, the El Camino had led to a permanent expansion of Los Angeles‚ÄìSan Diego service. After its withdrawal the equipment was stored in Bell, California. Ward was defeated for re-election in 1980. The failure of the El Camino played a major role in the campaign with his opponents using derisive sobriquets such as \\"Baxter Ward's Choo-Choo.\\" The county put the equipment up for sale and refused to release it for use on the short-lived CalTrain commuter service to Oxnard. The Alaska Railroad contemplated purchasing the equipment in 1984 but ultimately declined. In 1985 the county sold it to a tourist railroad in Mexico for $365,000. Commuter rail service in Orange County began again in 1990 with the inauguration of the Orange County Commuter.  Rolling stock  Los Angeles County purchased eight railcars from the Oregon, Pacific and Eastern Railway, a tourist railroad: five ex-Illinois Central coaches, two ex-Milwaukee Road tavern-lounges, and the Silver Planet, an ex-Western Pacific dome sleeper- observation car. The tavern-lounges or \\"Tap-Lounges\\" had previously served on the Afternoon Hiawatha between Chicago and the Twin Cities. The Silver Planet was part of the Western Pacific's equipment pool for the famed California Zephyr. The equipment, originally built in the 1940s, used steam heat. Amtrak's newer EMD F40PH locomotives only supported head-end power (HEP), which meant that the unreliable EMD SDP40F locomotives had to pull it.

It has a greater tolerance to fluctuations in water temperatures than do other species in the genus. It was named for the marine biologist R. K. Trench. Ecology Many shallow water corals rely on photosynthetic symbiont protists, commonly known as zooxanthellae, to provide them with a large proportion of their nutrient requirements. If sea water temperatures rise, conditions may becomes stressful for the corals, and they may expel their zooxanthallae. This process is known as coral bleaching as, without their symbionts, the corals are white. Symbiodinium trenchi is a stress-tolerant species, a generalist able to form mutualistic relationships with many species of coral. It is present in many reefs around the world in small numbers. It is common in the Andaman Sea, where the water is about 4 ¬∞C (7 ¬∞F) warmer than other parts of the Indian Ocean, and a diversity of corals thrive against the odds. This is due to their symbiosis with S. trenchi. In the Indo-Pacific region, it is found as a symbiont of corals in turbulent waters with wide temperature fluctuations. In the Caribbean Sea in late 2005, the water was, for three or four months, about 2 ¬∞C (4 ¬∞F) above the normal temperature for the time of year. This was stressful for corals and researchers found that S. trenchi, a symbiont not normally present in the area, took up residence in many corals in which it had not previously been observed. As a result, the corals did not bleach, but whether this is to the ultimate benefit of the corals remains to be seen. In subsequent years, S. trenchi has become less common in the Caribbean, and the normal symbionts have replaced it in the corals' tissues.

He later went on to excavate, with Gray, another similar site the Meare Lake Village. His work is commemorated in the Glastonbury Lake Village Museum at The Tribunal, Glastonbury.

The company is based in Windsor, Connecticut, with global locations in Changshu, China (Stanadyne Changshu Corporation), Chennai, India (Stanadyne India Private Limited), and Brescia, Italy (Stanadyne S.p.A.). The company also operates a manufacturing facility in Jacksonville, NC. The company specializes in fuel injection equipment producing components for gasoline direct injection engines, Common rail systems, electronic and mechanical governed rotary distributor pumps for diesel engines and diesel fuel injectors. Stanadyne is wholly owned by the private equity firm Kohlberg & Company. History The company was founded in 1876 as Hartford Machine Screw Company. It was renamed Standard Screw Company in 1900. The company added additional subsidiaries throughout the early part of the century. The combined company primarily made screws and other fasteners until the 1950s, when they diversified into fuel injection pumps and consumer faucets. In March 1970 Standard Screw Company changed its name to Stanadyne.Grant, Ellsworth S., Stanadyne: A History, Windsor, Conn.: Stanadyne, Inc., 1985. The Roosa Pump and The Moen Faucet In May 1947 a deal was made with Vernon D. Roosa to come to Hartford Machine Screw and perfect his fuel injection pump for diesel engines. The project initially cost more than expected with some directors in favor of abandoning, but by 1952 major bugs had been eliminated and the product was ready for market. Demand for diesel pumps climbed steadily through the 1950s and 60's. However, the oil crisis of the 1970s and General Motors' decision to install diesel engines in passenger cars, significantly stimulated pump sales. By the end of the decade, sales neared $120 million. In 1956, a deal was struck with Ravenna Metal Projects to acquire the company's first real consumer product ‚Äî the single-handle faucet developed by Alfred M. Moen. After a series of false starts, the company initiated a program to sell exclusively through plumbing wholesalers. This was later adapted to include retailers, and during the 1970s Moen sales rose from $40 million in 1972 to $100 million in 1979, one quarter of Stanadyne's total revenue.

Early life The eldest son of Irish jazz pianist Joe Gannon, Oliver Gannon was born in Dublin, Ireland, and emigrated with his family to Winnipeg, Canada, in 1957 when he was 14. He began playing in his late teens, after he purchased a Gibson ES-125 electric guitar and amplifier with his leftover tuition money earned from his summer job. Gannon enrolled at the University of Manitoba to study engineering but changed his mind. \\"I remember a thermodynamics class at 8 o'clock in the morning, having been playing the night before, and the blackboard was full of the Second Law of Thermodynamics or something, and I looked up at that and said, 'Is this what I want to do for the rest of my life, or do I want to do what I was doing last night?' A light bulb went off and I literally got up in the middle of the class, walked out, and never came back.\\" In 1964, he was accepted at the Berklee College of Music, where he studied composition and arranging with Herb Pomeroy and William Malloff, graduating in 1969. He credits this period in Boston with his exposure to jazz musicians such as Wes Montgomery, Wynton Kelly, Jimmy Cobb, and Paul Chambers.  Career Returning to Canada in 1969, Gannon settled in Vancouver, where he became a popular session musician. He worked often at the Cave Supper Club, joining Fraser MacPherson's big band. \\"The Cave band was such a joy to play,\\" remembers Gannon. \\"These guys were such excellent readers... They would play a brand new show perfectly the first time.\\" In 1970 he co-founded the fusion group Pacific Salt with trombonist Ian McDougall, Don Clark (trumpet), Ron Johnston (piano), Tony Clitheroe (double bass, bass guitar), and George Ursan (drums). Pacific Salt recorded three albums and was inactive by the early 1980s. McDougall, Gannon, and Johnston recorded as a trio in 1976 and 1988. In 1990, they toured Canadian festivals under the name RIO. In 1975 Gannon was invited by MacPherson to form a trio with bassist Wyatt Ruther. The collaboration lasted until MacPherson's death in 1993. With MacPherson's trio, Fraser & Friends, Gannon toured the U.S.S.R an unprecedented four times starting in 1978. The trio was the first Canadian group to tour the Soviet Union under the Soviet-Canadian Cultural Exchange Treaty. The group intended to play nine concerts in Moscow and Leningrad, but the schedule was expanded to thirteen. The group became the first North American jazz ensemble to be invited back, and they toured again in 1981, 1984, and 1986. Gannon has participated in groups in the Vancouver area and has played at most major festivals in the world: Montreux Jazz Festival (1979); North Sea Jazz Festival (1979); Concord Jazz Festival (1981); Montreal Jazz Festival (1982, 1984, 1995, 1997); Toronto Jazz Festival (1986, 1989, 1995, and 1998), Edmonton's Jazz City (1985), and appearances in his home town at the Vancouver International Jazz Festival. Gannon was the musical director for PG Music, a software company founded by his younger brother, Peter Gannon. He was with the company since its inception in 1989 and served as the executive producer of program content. He performed and produced content for the company's Band-in-a-Box. Gannon retired from the company in 2008. He was married to singer and bassist Patty Hervey.  Style  With MacPherson, Gannon employed an orchestral accompaniment style, while on his own recordings he displayed a linear, bop-based style, showing his roots as an admirer of Barney Kessel and Wes Montgomery, and Art Blakey. Other critics have noted Gannon's \\"slick, cool stylings\\", and \\"studies in careful and complete orchestration. His lines could be crisp and harmonically advanced, or fluid and lyrical.\\"  Awards and honors * Juno Award, Best Traditional Jazz Album, I Didn't Know About You with Fraser MacPherson, 1983 * Guitarist of the Year, National Jazz Awards (Canada), 2003 * Member of the Order of Canada, 2017  Discography  =As leader= * Three with Ron Johnston & Ian McDougall (Energy 1976) * I Didn't Know About You with Fraser MacPherson (Sackville, 1980) * Rio with Ron Johnston & Ian McDougall (Innovation, 1988) * Live at the Cellar (Cellar Live, 2002) * That's What (Cellar Live, 2004) * Two Much Guitar (Cellar Live, 2006) * Two Much More (Cellar Live, 2015) With Pacific Salt * Pacific Salt (Gramophone, 1973) * Jazz Canadiana (CBC, 1973) * Live Litte (Mountain Sound, 1976) =As sideman= With Fraser MacPherson * Live at the Planetarium (West End, 1976) * Honey and Spice (Justin Time, 1987) * Encore (Justin Time, 1990) * In the Tradition (Concord Jazz, 1992) With Ian McDougall * The Warmth of the Horn (Concord Jazz, 1995) * In a Sentimental Mood (Barbarian, 2005) * The Very Thought of You (Ten Mile Music, 2012) With others * Gary Guthman, Moonchild (Intercan, 1980) * Dave Robbins, The Dave Robbins Band (CBC, 1970) * Vancouver Chamber Choir, Simple Gifts (CBC, 1991) * Karen Young, Karen Young (Radio Canada, 1981) See also *Music of Canada  References   External links  * Official website Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Bebop guitarists Category:Berklee College of Music alumni Category:Canadian jazz guitarists Category:Canadian male guitarists Category:Juno Award for Best Jazz Album winners Category:Canadian male jazz musicians Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Musicians from Vancouver Category:Sackville Records artists ","title":"Oliver Gannon"},{"id":"45276937","text":"The modernisation losers thesis, or modernisation losers theory, is a theory associated with the academic Hans-Georg Betz that posits that individuals support far-right political parties because they wish to undo changes associated with modernisation.

Construction of the P.40 by Bela Nogrady was started in 1968 but the first flight was not made until 1975. The P.40 is a tailless aircraft with a swept, cantilever, low wing. In plan, the wing has a rectangular centre section and straight tapered outer panels with elevons. There are wing tip fins and outward opening rudders which extend a little below the wing. The short fuselage is flat sided, mostly occupied by a long canopy over the single seat cockpit. The engine, a Volkswagen 1.2 litre air- cooled flat-four, is in the rear in pusher configuration. The P.40 has a low, fixed, faired bicycle undercarriage. Operational history The first P.40 made only one short flight and was then destroyed. The history of the one surviving example, OO-68, on display in the Belgian Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels is obscure.

The Miami accent is most prevalent in American-born Hispanic youth who live in the Greater Miami area.  Origin  The Miami accent developed amongst second- or third-generation Miamians, particularly young adults whose first language was English, but were bilingual. Since World War II, Miami's population has grown rapidly every decade, due in part to the post-war baby boom. In 1950, the U.S. Census stated that Dade County's population was 495,084. Beginning with rapid international immigration from South American countries and the Caribbean (exacerbated by the Cuban exodus of the early 1960s), Miami's population has drastically grown every decade since. Many of these immigrants began to inhabit the urban industrial area around Downtown Miami. By 1970, the census stated that Dade County's population was 1,267,792. By 2000, the population reached 2,253,362. Growing up in Miami's urban center, second-, third-, and fourth-generation Miamians of the immigration wave of the 1960s and 1970s, developed the Miami accent. It is now the customary dialect of many citizens in the Miami metropolitan area. Phonology The Miami accent is a native dialect of English, not learner English or interlanguage. It is possible to differentiate this variety from an interlanguage spoken by second-language speakers in that the Miami accent does not generally display the following features: there is no addition of before initial consonant clusters with , speakers do not confuse with , (e.g., Yale with jail), and /r/ and /rr/ are pronounced as alveolar approximant [] instead of alveolar tap [] or alveolar trill [r] in Spanish. The Miami accent is based on a fairly standard American accent but with some changes very similar to dialects in the Mid-Atlantic (especially the New York area dialect, Northern New Jersey English, and New York Latino English.) Unlike Virginia Piedmont, Coastal Southern American, and Northeast American dialects (see section below), \\"Miami accent\\" is rhotic; it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish (wherein rhythm is syllable-timed). Some specific features of the accent include the following: *A lack of goat-fronting resulting in a backed /o ä/ vowel *No goose-fronting except for after coronal consonants (/t/, /d/, /s/, /z/, /n/) in which case there is heavy fronting *Extreme foot-lowering from  ä to a vowel somewhere between / å/ (used in ‚Äúcup‚Äù) and /…î/ (used in ‚Äúthought‚Äù). This is possibly a new dialect feature. *Miami was previously a transitional area for the cot-caught merger but has recently been found to completely merge /…ë/ and /…î/ Phonology and sounds of the Miami accent as reported in the Miami Herald: Features of the Miami accent from a report on the Miami accent from WLRN Radio: Lexical characteristics Speakers of the Miami accent occasionally use \\"calques\\": idioms (that would sound awkward or unusual to other native English speakers).

District 1 The incumbent is Republican Steve Scalise, who has represented the district since 2008. He was re-elected with 78% of the vote in 2014.

After it emerged that earlier in his career, Scalise has compared himself to Duke, Scalise distanced himself from Duke. This prompted Duke to say that he may run against Scalise in 2016 because Scalise had been \\"elected on false pretenses\\" and had \\"betrayed\\" the voters by \\"suggesting that they're racist because they supported my views\\".

At the University of G√∂ttingen (1791‚Äì92) he was taught by Johann Friedrich Gmelin and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. After that he got to know Martin Heinrich Klaproth and Sigismund Friedrich Hermbst√§dt in Berlin. At the same time Joachim Graf von Sternberg offered Lampadius to accompany him on a research travel to Russia and China. Their trip stopped in Moscow because they did not get the permission to enter interior Russia. So Lampadius followed von Sternberg to his possessions in Bohemia. There he worked as a chemist for the ironworks in Radwitz. Lampadius gas lamp Klaproth helped him to become a professor's assistant at the mining academy in Freiberg.

Summary The film begins just outside an antique shop, and a piece of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is played. Inside the shop, Krazy Kat, who operates the place, is having a little trouble walking around the ornaments. He lights a candle, and makes it safely to his bedroom. While Krazy is asleep, the ornaments in the shop, particularly the statues, come to life, and march to the melody of Schubert's Three Marches Militaires which is played. The statues represent historical people like Theodore Roosevelt, Napoleon, and various. They then put up a party where they drink ale from casks, dance, and sing Auld Lang Syne. Their party is so audible that Krazy eventually wakes up and goes to investigate. Several cartoons involve a theme where the shop's owner leaves, and the props come to life and party. The props would return to their quiet state if they knew the owner is coming back. But in the case of Antique Antics, Krazy gets to join the party, and the statues don't seem to mind. The film concludes with Krazy getting himself a mug of ale.

Biography Commemorative plaque at Hohenzollerndamm 110a, in Berlin-Schmargendorf Leonore Zweig was the daughter of Wilhelm Zweig, a brickworks owner, and grew up in a village in Lusatia. In 1916, she took her final school exams (Abitur) at the Grunewald-Gymnasium (since 1946 ) in Berlin-Grunewald. From 1916 to 1921, she studied English, German, and history in Jena and Berlin, and received a doctorate from Heidelberg University. In 1923, she married lawyer Ernst Goldschmidt. They had two children: Gertrud (1924) and Rudolf (1925). Leonore Goldschmidt worked as a teacher in England and Berlin. In 1922, she was at the Cecilien-Schule in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, and from 1925 on, she was at the Sophie-Charlotte- Gymnasium in Berlin-Charlottenburg. In order to improve her English language skills, in 1931, she traveled to England and studied at the St Christopher School in Letchworth. There she met and befriended a Quaker couple, headmaster Lyn Harris and his wife Eleanor Harris. Their educational views, which included senior students being involved in decision-making and promoting freedom, shaped Goldschmidt's educational approach to teaching. Being Jewish, Goldschmidt lost her position in 1933. In 1934, she worked at the Privaten J√ºdischen Waldschule Grunewald (Private Jewish Forest School Grunewald), founded and run by Toni Lessler, at Hagenstra√üe 56 in Berlin-Grunewald. On 1 May 1935, Goldschmidt set up her own school in Berlin-Grunewald, at Kronberger Stra√üe 24. In 1934, her cousin ) had been murdered, and Goldschmidt received an inheritance with which she financed her project. The school expanded quickly and comprised four more buildings: at Hohenzollerndamm 102, 105‚Äì110, and Berkaer Stra√üe 31. In 1937, the school had 520 students and 40 teachers. The Private J√ºdische Schule Dr. Leonore Goldschmidt (Private Jewish School Dr. Leonore Goldschmidt) was granted an official licence to run Abitur exams in 1936. The following year, the school became an Examination Centre of the University of Cambridge. The bilingual final examination enabled the students to enter English language universities in Europe and North America, making their emigration easier. When their school was officially shut down on 30 September 1939, the Goldschmidt family emigrated to England together with 80 students and some teachers. They reopened their school in Folkestone and continued until May 1940. Afterwards, Goldschmidt worked as a teacher at several private and state-funded schools in England until 1968. After her retirement, she studied Russian and lived in London until her death in 1983. Bibliography * Martin Sch√∂nfeld: Gedenktafeln in West-Berlin.

He is mainly remembered now for having facilitated the much-discussed marriage of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone and his third wife Mabel Bagenal, which took place at Warren's home, Drumcondra Castle, in 1591.Gibney p.3 Family Warren was the son of Captain Humphrey Warren (died 1561) and Elizabeth Clifford (died 1581).O'Laughlin p.34 His father, a professional soldier of English birth, had come to Ireland in the service of the English Crown in about 1550. He enjoyed the confidence of three successive monarchs, and was a close associate of Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, Lord Deputy of Ireland 1556-1558. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Carrickfergus in the Parliament of 1559.O'Laughlin p.34 His marriage was a most advantageous one. Elizabeth Clifford was the daughter and co-heiress of Sir Nicholas Clifford of Sutton Valence and Bobbing in Kent, and his wife Mary Harper. She was the widow of Sir William Brabazon, the Vice- Treasurer of Ireland, and of Christopher Blount, a cousin of Baron Mountjoy. After Humphrey's death she made a fourth marriage to Sir Edward Moore. William was thus born into the heart of the Anglo-Irish ruling class: he was a half- brother of Edward Brabazon, 1st Baron Ardee, and of Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore. His grandmother Mary Harper was the sister of Sir George Harper, a politician of some importance in the reign of Henry VIII. The Harper family had a connection by marriage to the King through his fifth Queen Catherine Howard. Another powerful connection was Sir Conyers Clifford, Lord President of Connaught (died 1599), who was William's second cousin on his mother's side. William and his brother Henry continued this family tradition of advantageous marriages: Henry married Alice Loftus, daughter of Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin and his wife Jane Purdon, and William, sometime after 1586, married Jenet Finglas, daughter of Patrick Finglas of Westphailstown and widow of John Bathe, Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer. Through this marriage he acquired for his lifetime possession of very substantial lands in County Dublin, and of Drumcondra Castle.O'Laughlin p.34 His wife's open adherence to the Roman Catholic faith caused him some trouble politically. At a time when Irish office holders were required to take the Oath of Supremacy, recognising Elizabeth I as head of the Church of Ireland, Warren was suspected, probably with good reason, of privately sharing his wife's religious beliefs. Of her first husband's children, two became Catholic priests, which inevitably raised questions about the religious upbringing they had received at home, especially as their father John Bathe had also been an open Catholic. There are numerous references in the Calendar of State Papers to Lady Warren's reception of Catholic priests at Drumcondra Castle, and the Crown kept a discreet eye on her activities even after Warren's death.√ì'Math√∫na p.29 William Warren and Hugh O'Neill He was given a military command, and in April 1586 he was entrusted by the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir John Perrot, with the task of negotiating with Sorley Boy MacDonnell, a powerful Scottish chieftain who had challenged the authority of the English Crown by establishing a political base in County Antrim. Sorley had been on friendly terms with William's father Humphrey in the late 1550s, and William succeeded in persuading him to come to terms with the Crown. William asked repeatedly to be made Governor of Carrickfergus, but without success. Like his half-brother Garrett, Lord Moore, he became a close friend and ally of Hugh O'Neill.Gibney p.3 Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone- Warren was one of his closest associates. = Hugh O'Neill and Mabel Bagenal= Hugh O'Neill's third marriage in August 1591 to Mabel, daughter of Sir Nicholas Bagenal, Knight Marshal of Ireland, is one of the most romanticised episodes in Irish history: Mabel has been called \\"the Helen of Troy of Elizabethan Ireland\\". Whether it was a genuine love marriage (as suggested in the play Making History by Brian Friel) or whether it was an effort by O'Neill to become a member of Mabel's powerful family is debatable. What is clear is the central role which Warren and his wife played in the marriage. Mabel, who had been living with her sister Mary and Mary's husband Patrick Barnewall at Turvey House, appeared at Drumcondra Castle, about six miles from Turvey, where she was quickly followed by O'Neill.O'Faol√°in p.118 According to the detailed version of the marriage given by Se√°n √ì Faol√°in in his biography of O'Neill, Warren visited Turvey House to pay a call on Mabel, and pretended to \\"kidnap\\" her (in fact with her full connivance) and then rode to Drumcondra, where they were joined by O'Neill.O'Faolain p.118 Since Mabel wished to be married in a Protestant ceremony, the marriage was celebrated in Drumcondra Castle by Thomas Jones, Bishop of Meath, and future Archbishop of Dublin, although the Bishop, by his own account, performed the ceremony with great reluctance, and only to save Mabel's good name.O'Faol√°in p.119 The wedding was followed by five days of feasting, after which the newlyweds departed for O'Neill's home at Dungannon. Warren is said to have been a regular visitor to O'Neill's house in the following months, and to have accompanied him several times to Mass. These stories, whether true or false, can only have increased suspicions about his loyalty to the Crown.O'Faol√°in pp.118-9 =Nine Years' War= The outbreak of the Nine Years' War, one of the most serious Irish rebellions against English rule, in which Hugh O'Neill was the overall commander on the Irish side, placed Warren in a very difficult position. Despite his English parentage and powerful Anglo-Irish family connections, his closeness to the \\"Arch-Rebel\\" O'Neill, and the long-held suspicion that he was secretly a Roman Catholic, inevitably raised serious questions about his own loyalties, although he maintained that he was prepared to fight against O'Neill, and also to persuade him to come to terms. By 1596 Warren's loyalty was so dubious that, despite being seriously ill, he was summoned to a hearing before the Irish Privy Council, where he was reprimanded and threatened with imprisonment, although the threat was not carried out. Later years Warren's fortunes improved during the Deputyship of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex: Warren was in high favor with Essex, whom he entertained at Drumcondra Castle. Gibney p.3 After the downfall of Essex, Warren was quick to ingratiate himself with the new dominant power at the English Court, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. Through Cecil's favor he at last obtained the Governorship of Carrickfergus, but died soon afterwards. He and Jenet had several daughters, one of whom married Warren's stepson James Bathe, √ì'Math√∫na p.30 but no son. At his death possession of his lands reverted to the Bathe family. His widow remarried as his second wife Terence O'Dempsey, 1st Viscount Clanmalier.√ì'Math√∫na p.30 She died in 1627; Lord Clanmalier died in 1638.

Background Jerry Lee Lewis signed with Smash in 1963 and, after four years, Mercury executives did not seem to know what do with him. Although he remained very popular in Europe, and a riveting live performer, he enjoyed little chart success. Mercury had tried an album of Sun Records remakes (Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis in 1964) and a country-themed album (Country Songs for City Folks in 1965) but they did not come close to recapturing the triumphs Lewis had enjoyed with Sam Phillips. Rock and pop music had also changed enormously by 1967, making it more difficult for Mercury to figure out how to market Lewis. As Colin Escott notes in the sleeve to the 1995 Mercury compilation Killer Country, by the late '60s \\"Jerry's idea of rock music was almost ten years out of date. In private conversation, he would offer the opinion that the Beatles should go back across the Atlantic at a slow walk, but no amount of posturing could turn back the clock.\\" Recording By 1967, producer Shelby Singleton left Mercury to form his own label and Jerry Kennedy would take complete charge of Lewis's recordings. Kennedy eventually produced Jerry Lee's comeback single \\"Another Place, Another Time\\" the following year, which ushered in a string of country hits for Lewis well into the next decade but, as biographer Joe Bonomo writes in Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, by 1967 Kennedy was \\"scratching his head over what the heck to do.

The primary sports supported by CH Sevilla were ice hockey and figure skating, however, the club also maintained others such as judo, horse riding and kart racing. CH Sevilla was the first ice club in Andalusia to provide sporting licenses to figure skaters and ice hockey players. Official picture of CH Sevilla (senior team) for the 1976/77 seasonSporting activities were developed in what was the first permanent Andalusian ice rink with regulation dimensions and known by the name \\"HIELOTRON\\". This sport arena was considered a futuristic, spectacular building and won the national prize of architecture in 1975. The ice hockey team participated in the Spanish official competitions of the highest level in both senior Liga Nacional de Hockey Hielo and junior categories. Several figure skaters participated in the 1978 Spanish Championship in different categories. On February 23, 1978, a storm with high winds destroyed the sports arena's cover causing significant damage to the building, nevertheless, no personal injury occurred. The club's members supplied temporary repairs which allowed ice sporting activities to continue outdoors. The temporary fixes were short-lived because it was impractical to keep the facility open after the month of April without a covering. Funds were not available to make the necessary permanent repairs, and the facility closed, halting ice club activities. Unfortunately, while the facilities were in good condition, with exception of the roof, no other private or public organization was interested in maintaining the sports facility. History of the first Andalusian ice hockey team The first members of the senior ice hockey team came mainly from Sevillian teams of roller hockey. Some additional players also came from other Spanish ice hockey teams who came to live in Seville for work or school. The remainder of the players were young Sevillians who started ice hockey locally. During the first months after the public opening of the ice rink, ice hockey players from USA, who were serving in the Naval Base of Rota (C√°diz), began to rent the ice rink to train and play unofficial matches. The team was led by Capt. Mike Westrick and Asst. Capt. John Roche. A few of these players ending up in the Spanish National Hockey League. After a few weeks, a team named \\"Rota Flying Wings\\" was formed to play matches against CH Seville. Every Saturday during the summer, the two teams squared off in matches that continued until the start of the National League. Official jersey of CH Sevilla of the 1976/77 and 1977/78 seasonsThe ice rink was opened, uninterruptedly throughout the hot Sevillian summer without ice problems. In a display of patriotism, the American team \\"Rota Flying Wings\\" put a small USA flag on their jerseys, giving rise to a good-natured international rivalry. Players used the matches to train and improve skills as well as increase awareness of hockey in their area. The matches also helped prepare the CH Seville team for the imminent start of the National League. The first official match of an Andalusian ice hockey team took place on December 5, 1976, in Barcelona, when the CH Seville played as visiting team against CH Barcelona-Catalonia. The first official ice hockey game in Andalusia, with the participation of an Andalusian team, was on December 12, 1976 against CH Casco Viejo Bilbao.http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1976/12/11/048.htmlhttp://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1976/12/14/029.html However, this match was not the first official ice hockey game held in Andalusia, since shortly after the ice rink public opening was held in Seville the final phase of the Copa Rey de Hockey sobre hielo.

It consists mainly of the hummocky bright plains that occupy the surface. This area is defined on the west by Chaac Patera, and on the east by Camaxtli Patera. At least 10 distinct volcanic centers are located in the region, making it a volcanically active region on Io's surface. Most of the volcanism here is expressed as paterae, which range in size from circular to elliptical. A patera is defined by the International Astronomical Union as \\"irregular or complex craters with scalloped edges.\\" The largest volcanic structure here is the Chaac Patera (105 km X 48 km). The paterae found in the Chaac-Camaxtli region are Chaac, Balder Patera, Grannos, Ababinili, Ruaumoko, Steropes, Camaxtli, Tien Mu, Utu, and Mentu. This region is full of features that provide clues to the volcanism, tectonism, and magmatic processes on Io. Similar concepts happening on Io have been thought to have occurred in Earth's past, and some terrestrial analogues occur today. Observations alt=Photo a planetary body covered in numerous dark spots in front of the bright and dark clouds of Jupiter. Voyager 1 provided the first images of the different geologic structures on Io. These were later used to identify key volcanic features, including color of magma to deduce composition and determine eruption sequences. The Voyager provided poor resolution photos (5‚Äì20 km/pixel) of the Chaac-Camaxtli region, which provided little further study. The photos were, however, used to map dark spots of Chaac Patera, Camaxtli Patera, and another region which is now considered Sobo Fluctus. An important discovery was Io's lack of impact craters, meaning it is resurfaced at a geologically fast rate. alt=A multi-colored image of the full disk of a planetary body, dotted with numerous dark spots. Much of the middle portion of the planetary body is yellow to white/gray, while the polar regions at the top and bottom are generally reddish in color. The main imagery used in viewing the area was produced by the Galileo I27 flyby which occurred in February 2000, which was paired with C21 low-resolution (1.4 km/pixel) color schemes. Because of the success of these pictures, different volcanic features were identified and appropriately named. Geography =Chaac Patera= The Galileo I27 flyby of Io provided very detailed photos (5‚Äì10 m/pixel) of Chaac Patera. This patera is located at (11.8¬∞N, 157.2¬∞W) and defines the western edge of the Chaac-Camaxtli region. It is named after the Mayan god of thunder and rain. The patera walls are ~4 km tall and the average slope of them is ~70¬∞. Its dimensions are 105 km X 48 km. The patera appears to be situated on a large plateau, that declines elevation on each side. The steep scarps also suggest that the materials it's made out of must be tough to avoid collapse. This patera is often dubbed \\"golf course\\" because of its presence of green material on the floor, detected by NIMS. NIMS (near-infrared mass spectrometer) is used to interpret thermal data. The floor of the patera is covered in lava, but the images cannot discern whether the green is a primary or secondary feature. The lava on the floor of the patera are thought to mimic morphologies similar to terrestrial calderas such as Kilauea Caldera in Hawaii. This is supported by their tendency to inflate or pool up when they are secluded, and also how they drain back into vents, resulting from escaping gases in the magma. This helps provide insight on how the lavas of the region operate. Lava rises along rim fractures. This observation hints that the paterae on Io are formed by a combination of volcanism and tectonics. The kidney shape is Chaac Patera. The lines around the patera represent ridge orientations. The thicker ridges are oriented at 010 azimuth and the thinner are at 088. Ridge orientation is formed by tidal fluxing. The floors of the patera are covered in inflated lava flows and lakes, suggested by the \\"bathtub ring\\" structures and smaller islands. The lavas flow out, then sink back to their vents. A possible vent is located in the southernmost portion of the patera, which migrated from the north. Migration patterns can be concluded from changes in pictures from the Voyager to the Galileo. This agrees with the hot spot that has been found here as well. Many articles agree that a low to medium thickness layer of SO2 is present in the patera. The ridge orientations around the patera could provide information on the regional lithosphere. The ridges are oriented in a constant 010¬∞ azimuth, independent of patera wall orientation. There are also smaller ridges present with an 088¬∞ azimuth. These ridges appear to be of no influence of local mountains or faults. Instead, the ridge orientations are formed by tidal flexing of Io by Jupiter. =Camaxtli Patera= The right feature is Camaxtli Patera. The dark flows on the floor and halo composed of dark diffuse material can be seen. Camaxtli Patera is on the eastern edge of the Chaac-Camaxtli region (15¬∞N,136¬∞W). It is named after the Aztec god of thunder, tornado, and war. There is a hot spot in the patera. Most imaging of the patera come from NIMS, and orbits E15, I24, and I27 of the Galileo flybys. The patera features dark flows on its floor, along with a dark rim, possibly from the lava being erupted from faults at the bases of the walls. There is a moderate abundance of white SO2 concentration in the region. The patera also has a dark halo around it, composed of dark diffuse material. The extensive amount of dark material in and around the patera coupled with differences in Voyager and Galileo photos suggests that it is quite active. This observation is supported by NIMS data. The vent location has migrated from the east side to the west side of the patera. =Sobo Fluctus= Sobo Fluctus is a dark volcanic flow field located in the Chaac-Camaxtli region of Io. It is named after the Voodoo spirit of thunder. The coordinates are (14¬∞N, 151¬∞W). The estimated temperature here is ~130K. The estimated area of dark material is ~1.3 X 103 km2. The dark flows are surrounded by bright lava flows that are thought to be secondary sources of volcanism rich in sulfur and SO2. Surface colors Mapping of the Chaac-Camaxtli region is primarily based on the mapping done by Williams et al. in 2002. The mapping was based on color and textural differences on the surface. Differences in color and texture show what types of magma have erupted and give rise to what is located in the interior of Io. =Hummocky bright plains= Hummocky bright plains The Chaac- Camaxtli region accounts for a large portion of the bright plains found on the equatorial region of Io. The albedo of these regions is in between that of Dark and Bright Patera Floor Materials, linked to SO2 abundance and grain size. Hummocky textures are described as mounds or ridges that are raised in elevation compared to the surrounding material. The hummocks occur in relatively uniform size (~200‚Äì500 m wide, ~1‚Äì2 km long). They are usually found in groups. The hummocky texture is hard to see at low resolution photos, but higher resolution photos make them appear and also show orientation patterns. Near the eastern portion of Chaac Patera, orientation is perpendicular to margin. There are a number of different theories regarding the origin of the hummocky texture, however not enough is known to rule out or favor different ideas. These areas show enrichment in SO2. This indicates a colder part of the surface that preserves the SO2. The source of the colder temperatures that allows SO2 to concentrate here could be linked to magma delivery mechanisms or relative lithosphere thickness. =Dark patera= Dark patera This material is described by Williams et al. as green to grey to black with large variation in albedo and texture. At low resolution, they appear smooth, but at higher resolution, hummocks and combinations of dark and light material are seen. Little SO2 is thought to be present, based on NIMS data. This material is found in Chaac Patera and thought to mimic the Kilauea Caldera floor overall, which would form from low viscosity, dark lavas ranging from mafic to ultramafic composition. Hummocks or pits are thought to be from the effect of inflation or vent openings that are common in this type of lava flow. Dark colored materials are the source of more heat. =Bright patera floor material= Bright patera Bright patera floor material is thought to be SO2/sulfur-rich. The material is thought to consist of frozen layers of white SO2 and orange layers of SO2/sulfur-rich deposits with other elements mixed in. This material is found mostly inside of paterae, but also can be found along the rims. =Bright flow= Bright flow This material is illustrated by a smooth flow in medium resolution. Color ranges from orange to white with flow lengths greater than their widths. These flows are interpreted as low- viscosity flows with sulfur-rich constituents. Albedo and cross-cutting is used to determine relative ages in the flows. The lighter, brighter colors represent younger flows. =Undivided flow= Undivided flow Relatively intermediate albedos and smooth, several hundred meter flows typify these materials. Contact with surrounding terrain not as sharp as observed with bright and dark flow material. Origin of flows is often hard to tell. It is difficult to distinguish individual flows in a group. It is believed to have origin in sulfur/silicate-rich effusive eruptions. =Dark flow= Dark flow These flows are darker in color and are usually hotter according to NIMS observations. The length is generally greater than their width. The height of them tend to be larger based on the shadows they create. The Chaac Patera hot spot is a good example of this type of flow. Lava composition varies, but usually it is low-viscosity, mafic to ultramafic in composition. =Bright diffuse material= Bright diffuse material These units are thought to be explosively pyroclastic in origin. They can range in size up to tens of kilometers. They usually occur near volcanic cones (Camaxtli Patera). =Dark diffuse material= Dark diffuse material Similar to bright diffuse materials, but with darker color. These are associated with the halo surrounding the rim on Camaxtli Patera. Darker color materials are the source of more heat. . =Red diffuse material= Red diffuse material Only one occurrence of this unit has been mapped in the area, at Sobo Fluctus. This material is related to explosive pyroclastic eruptions around volcanic cones. These materials are thought to come from vents by condensation of S2 gas and recrystallization of short-chain sulfur Implications There is a connection between volcanism and crustal thickness on the subsurface of Io. Thinner crust produces dense, mafic, dark flows that cover larger areas and where secondary, more sulfurous flows occur. Conversely, in thicker crust regions, the more dense lavas do not occur as often. Crustal thickness is thought to be related to tidal flexing in the interior of Io. The shift from dark, freshly erupted material into bright plains material may support the notion that Io has strong crustal materials that can support the steep paterae walls. The lithosphere of Io is thought to be well-fractured, which is supported by the paterae hot spot migration between the times of the Voyager and the Galileo flybys. The idea that Io's lithosphere is composed of a partially crystallized magma ocean would make magma's ability to rise to the surface change, thus changing the vent migrations of paterae as well.

The 1920s were the beginning of the heyday of public dancing to the music of popular bands and orchestras, and large ballrooms were built in most urban areas, and even on Catalina Island, 26 miles off the California coast. No expense was spared in the construction of the ballroom, which was a city block long, and half a block wide. It featured reinforced concrete walls, a \\"floating\\" hard wood floor and a tile roof. After a fire in 1935 the ballroom was rebuilt with an arched roof supported by sectional girders of wood in a cross pattern, the same as used in the nearby blimp hangars for the Marine Corps. The Rendezvous Ballroom caught fire again in 1966, and was never rebuilt. The site now has beachfront condominiums. Famous performers Among the notables who played at the Rendezvous was Stan Kenton, jazz band leader, who originated a TV show from there in 1957-58 and recorded the albums Rendezvous with Kenton (1957) and Back to Balboa (1958) at the venue. The ballroom was closed until surf-rock guitarist Dick Dale began performing there in 1960. Attendance grew from a few hundred to a capacity crowd of 4,000 on Saturday nights. When Dale left for the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in 1962, attendance at the Rendezvous continued to grow with bands like The Beach Boys, The Challengers, The Righteous Brothers and others.

He was the son of John Purdie, a British consul, and Eleanor Pratt, his Massachusetts-born wife. Although born in the Ottoman Empire, he moved to West Newton, Massachusetts as a child. By 1858, Purdie was devoting himself to ornithology, collecting nests and eggs. However, in 1862 he joined the navy to fight in the American Civil War. He was discharged the next year for frequent seasickness. After the war, Purdie made connections with leading ornithologists and became a founding member of the Nuttall Ornithological Club, serving as its vice president in 1873 to 1875, and then the president from 1875 to 1876.

The castle was first recorded in AD 967, and by the 14th century a fortified house existed with a strong curtain wall. The church was also fortified in the 14th century. The castle as it stands today was largely built in the 16th century as a response to the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. The castle had largely fallen into ruin by the second half of the 19th century, although the church continued in use as the local parish church. In 1893 a notorious murder took place in the rectory when a young baker broke in and murdered the parish priest and his niece. The murderer was soon caught, and was executed outside the castle walls in 1895. Soon afterwards the castle was purchased by a wealthy Barcelonan banker, who refurbished it and added decorative crenellations throughout. In the early 20th century the parish church was moved to its current location and the castle church was refurbished as a family chapel. The castle again achieved notoriety during the Spanish Civil War when the International Brigades used it as a disciplinary prison camp, with resulting executions and torture. Location The castle stands upon a high hill to the northeast of the town centre, occupying a prominent position overlooking the coast. The hill has a number of artificial terraces on its eastern and southern sides, and its summit is covered with vegetation. Description The eastern section of the castle keep The castle consists of a fortress dominated by a high, circular tower. It possesses a number of smaller towers of a variety of types, and the complex includes a church, and residential buildings on the western side. The southern portion of the castle bailey is occupied by the partially fortified church and its associated outbuildings, including the rectory and vestry, and a cemetery. The castle keep, actually consisting of two main buildings, is on the west side. The eastern portion of the keep is built from red sandstone, quarried in Begues. The western portion is bulkier and has plaster-coated masonry, giving it a beige colour. The entire complex of buildings, incorporating both the keep and the church and their associated outbuildings, is contained within a fortified enclosure, the wall of which has been modified throughout the castle's history. The outer gate of the castle is at the northern extreme of the bailey; it is decorative in nature and was built in 1897. History Archaeological reconnaissance of the hillside below the castle revealed abundant ancient remains, leading to the conclusion that the hill supported an ancient Iberian settlement and a later Roman villa. The Iberian settlement, inhabited by the Laietani, has been dated from the middle of the 3rd century BC to the end of the 1st century BC. The town of the Laietani covered the hilltop and the adjoining southern and eastern flanks. An Iberian water cistern was found carved from the bedrock under the castle's subsoil. A number of Iberian house remains were excavated under the church, although none have been found under the main area of the castle due to later modifications to the land surface, in order to level the courtyard in the middle of the 16th century. =Roman occupation= The Roman villa has been dated from the 1st century BC to the 6th century AD. The discovery of a 2nd-century funerary monument dedicated to Caius Trocina Synecdemus has led the excavator to attribute the ownership of the villa to him. The villa probably fell within the ager of Barcino, and was at the edge of a small port; it was probably used by Trocina Synecdemus to fund his public office of sevir augustalis (priest of the Imperial cult) in Barcino. =10th‚Äì14th centuries= The church of St. Mary within the curtain wall, with the base of a 14th-century tower in the foreground The church of St. Mary was built on the hill in the 10th century by the monastery of Sant Cugat, which had been given instruction to develop the Castelldefels region by Sunyer, Count of Barcelona. The new church was first mentioned in a document dating to AD 967. The first mention of a castle on the hill is an indirect reference to the church of St. Mary of Castrum Felix (\\"Fortunate Castle\\" in Latin). Archaeologists have not identified any remains of this early castle, suggesting that it may have been just a tower or perishable fortification, or that it stood on the highest part of the hill, located within the present-day castle courtyard, the bedrock of which was levelled during the 16th century. The church structure visible today is Romanesque in style and dates from the 11th century. The Romanesque church was probably consecrated in 1106. It has a single nave with three apses, a transept, and supports a small belltower. By the 14th-15th centuries, regional instability led to the increased need for defences, and the church was fortified. Records from the period indicate that the hilltop had been occupied by a fortified house with a strong curtain wall. The earliest known remains of the castle date to the 14th century; a truncated circular tower to the south of the church is of this date. Also in the 14th century, the church was partially fortified, particularly the southern apse, and battlements were added. =16th century= By the middle of the 16th century the Ottoman Empire was increasingly powerful and controlled much of the Mediterranean Sea; their alliance with Barbary pirates presented increased danger to the coastal population of Catalonia. In response, King Philip II of Spain ordered the construction of an extensive series of fortifications along the Mediterranean coast. At this time, the existing fortified house was demolished and the first phase of the castle was constructed from red sandstone. At this time the castle's basal platform and retaining walls were built. The great southwest tower was erected in 1590. =19th century= The decorative main gate dates to the end of the 19th century Murders of 1893 In 1893, the castle church still served as the parish church, and the rectory was inhabited. On 26 August, a 25-year-old Aragonese baker by the name of Joaqu√≠n Figueras broke into the rectory and stabbed 60-year-old parish priest Jacint Orta Berenguer 14 times. He also attacked his ex-girlfriend, 21-year-old Rita Bosch Orta, who was the priest's niece, stabbing her 27 times and shooting her twice. He is reported to have raped her as she lay dying. Figueras was arrested in Barcelona on 3 September and confessed to the murders, although he denied robbing and raping Rita Bosch Orta. He was tried in Barcelona in June 1894. He was quickly found guilty and was sentenced to death. He was garroted beneath the castle walls at 9am on 19 June 1895 before an estimated crowd of eight thousand people. His corpse was displayed until 5pm; he was then buried next to his victims in the castle cemetery. Restoration Interior of the keep By the second half of the 19th century, the castle had fallen into ruin and, at the end of the century, its ownership passed into the hands of Manuel Girona, a powerful Barcelonan banker and politician. He contracted Catalan architect Enric Sagnier to restore the castle walls and towers, and add Gothic-style windows and doors. Decorative crenellations were added to the great southwest tower, and to most of the castle walls. The work was completed in 1897. =20th century= Girona died in 1903, and his son, Manuel Girona Vidal, restored the church for use as a family chapel. He also built the current parish church in Castelldefels, and the image of St. Mary was moved there from the castle in 1911. Spanish Civil War The castle was used as a base of operations by the Republican International Brigades from April 1938 to January 1939, being moved there from Albacete under pressure from an offensive by General Franco. The castle was first used as a Republican military training centre. On 12 April 1938, Italian commissary general Luigi Gallo announced that the castle would be used as a prison. It was then prepared as a prison camp by the Croatian commander Milan ƒÜopiƒá, in order to hold brigade soldiers accused of indiscipline. The prison guards were quartered in the chapel of the Virgen de la Salud (\\"Virgin of Health\\"). As soon as the base was put into use, 265 prisoners were moved to the castle. ƒÜopiƒá immediately ordered that 60 of them be shot in order to reduce the number of prisoners held; during the months that followed, torture and executions were carried out in the castle by the Republican forces. Late 20th century In 1988, ownership of the castle passed to Castelldefels municipal council. In 1989, the council launched a project to restore the church and its associated buildings, including the sacristy and rectory. At the same time an investigation of the castle complex was also undertaken. Roman monument Limestone block with 2nd century Roman inscription During the 1989 restoration project, workers uncovered a Latin inscription upon a limestone block embedded in the rectory wall. The block measured , with the area of the inscription measuring . The block possibly served as the base of a statue, and was inscribed with: C. TROCINAE C. LIB. SYNECDEMO IIIIII VIR. AUG. VALERIA.HALINE MARITO.OPTIMO This was interpreted as \\"To Caius Trocina Synecdemus, freedman of Caius, sevir augustalis, (dedicated by his wife) Valeria Haline for having been an excellent husband\\". The monument has been dated to the 2nd century AD. The inscription identified the block as one that had been examined and recorded in the same rectory by an 18th-century antiquarian. The excavator believes that the memorial stone was found very close to its original location, and that the Roman villa belonged to Trocina Synecdemus.

Caja Navarra lost all its worth, causing its actual demise. Caja Navarra's acronym and brand CAN was kept converted into a foundation. The highly controversial crash of the institution gave way to a demand of responsibilities. Approach A closed Caja Navarra branch in San Sebasti√°n Miguel Sanz, ex-president of Navarre Caja Navarra (CAN) is a merger of two entrenched savings banks renowned for their proximity to the Navarrese people, and considered a sign of identity, as well as a symbol of Navarre's economic solvency and autonomy. In the 1980s and 1990s, 43% of the money of the Navarrese was held in either of both institutions, representing the prime financial institution in Navarre. After the fusion of the savings banks Caja Provincial de Navarra and Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Pamplona in 2000, the re-founded institution undertook a series of financial operations and expansion of its branches out of Navarre (including a representative office in Washington). As a result, CAN's assets plummeted. The savings bank became insolvent in 2012 after years of asset-stripping, including the mysterious disappearance of its artistic collection. The fallout of the scandal affected high- and mid-ranking officials of the regional party UPN (Uni√≥n del Pueblo Navarro) who held political and managerial positions both within the bank and the Government of Navarre. Mismanagement In 2010 the Board of Founding Partners was established to insulate Caja Navarra from political meddling, but paradoxically it integrated well-known political personalities, all of them high-ranking members of UPN and PSN (Spanish Socialists in Navarre), such as Yolanda Barcina, Miguel Sanz, Alberto Catal√°n, Roberto Jimenez, or Enrique Maya (mayor of Pamplona since 2011). Caja Navarra-related societies of dubious operation came into being, such as Sociedad Industrial de CAN and HISCAN Patrimonio S.L. Their Permanent Board members, all of them high-ranking officials or ex-officials of the government of Navarre (UPN) and PSN, have come to be accused of receiving irregular bonuses. Only in 2011, the 16 permanent board members of HISCAN Patrimonio S.L. received 121,000 euros in bonuses, a period in which CAN incurred heavy financial losses estimated at 203 million euros in just one year, down from 500-plus millions‚Äô worth, during Yolanda Barcina‚Äôs one-year tenure in the board.Ateak Ireki (2013), 37‚Äô18 It was revealed that Yolanda Barcina, Miguel Sanz, √Ålvaro Miranda, and Enrique Maya got paid 2,860 and 1,717 euros each for participating in one-hour meetings (two consecutively) of a ghostly Permanent Board, held 16 times. The meetings consisted of a financial briefing to the board members, in which no questions were made and no minutes were recorded. After the revelations, president of the region Yolanda Barcina claimed she would give the money back, while apologizing to the people of Navarre for her behaviour. In the period extending from 2004 to 2011, the estimated figure in bonuses to representatives of political, social and cultural agencies affiliated to Caja Navarra (including Ricardo Mart√≠n Fluxa, a Spanish ex-Secretary of State for Security, or Javier Iturbe, PSN ex-president and member of the Board of Directors) amounted to 4,3 million euros. Parliamentary investigation In late 2014, opposition parties of the Parliament of Navarre promoted the establishment of a parliamentary investigation panel to clear responsibilities. The Spanish Socialists' branch in Navarre, the PSN, voiced its misgivings, while the party at the centre of the controversy, the anti- Basque UPN, showed a frontal refusal, arguing that the case had to be left to Justice, actually Madrid tribunals (a Supreme Court ruling had recently acquitted the president of Navarre Yolanda Barcina of legal misconduct in the scandal of Caja Navarra‚Äôs irregular bonuses). However, a vote majority in the regional parliament made it possible the creation of that panel. Opposition parties (Geroa Bai, EH Bildu, Izquierda-Ezkerra) other than the Spanish Conservatives (PP) lashed out at the Socialists for attempting to constrain the range of topics to be addressed in the scrutiny, as well as allowing with their abstention to propel the party UPN, allegedly responsible for Caja Navarra's demise and main opponent to the parliamentary investigation, to chair the investigation panel and hold a critical position.

At some point the deserted medieval village of Ganthorpe with its chapel was at the north of what became the Stoke Rochford Estate, the Hall itself sitting further south between the townships of North Stoke at its north, and South Stoke at its south. North Stoke was demolished in 1841‚Äì1843 during the rebuilding of the previous 1794 Stoke Rochford Hall and its Estate's further enclosure, redesign and expansion.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John: The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire, Penguin (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram (1989), Yale University Press, pp. 642, 643. \\"Deserted Medieval Village, North Stoke\\", Reference Name MLI33933, Lincs to the Past, Lincolnshire Archives.

The possible site of North Stoke St Andrew's was excavated in 1968, which revealed 11th- to 14th-century pottery, with further 16th- to 17th-century and Saxo-Norman pottery nearby. In the early 20th century parts of an 11th-century limestone cross with interlace patterns were found in St Andrew's Church ruins; the remains are now in the churchyard of St Andrew and St Mary's. Chancel and 15th-century south and north chancel chapels from the east The oldest parts of the church are the nave, essentially Norman, and a west tower hood mould which could be 11th-century (Pevsner). Chancel chapels were added in the 15th century: the south in 1448 by Ralph Rochford, and the north in 1460‚Äì70 by Henry Rochford, brother of Ralph. The Rochfords, who came to England under the Norman Conquest, took their name from the town of Rochford in Essex, and gave their name to the Stoke-Rochford manor and parish.Cox, J. Charles (1916): Lincolnshire p. 294, 295. Methuen & Co. Ltd. Rochford family members include a soldier in Edward III‚Äôs French wars who was charged with the safety of John II of France during his captivity at Somerton Castle, Lincolnshire, a commissioner of Lincolnshire banks and sewers (fenland drainage), one given authority by Richard II to oversee horse and cattle selling in Holland and Kesteven, and between 1344 and 1409, six becoming High Sheriffs of Lincolnshire. Sir Ralph Rochford, who provided for the building of South Stoke St Mary's south chapel, was granted at Stoke free warren‚Äîhunting privilege from the King in 1448 on condition of preventing exploitation by others‚Äîa position previously held by John de Neville of Ganthorpe during the reign of Edward II. A sculptured high relief slab, possibly of John de Neville and his wife, was found in a field at Ganthorpe now lies in the north chapel, having been installed in the 19th century. Henry Rochford who added St Mary's north chapel, and who in 1427 had received lands, house and buildings at North and South Stoke, was the last with Stoke's Rochford family name. He married Elizabeth Scrope (d.1503). She was the daughter of Henry Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Bolton who owned the neighbouring manor of Easton, and the widow of Sir John Bigod of Mulgrave Castle, Yorkshire who was killed at the Battle of Towton during the Wars of the Roses. Upon the death of Henry Rochford, Elizabeth married Oliver St John (d.1497), son of the Duchess of Somerset, and step father of Margaret Beaufort who was mother of Henry VII. The bodies of Oliver St John and Elizabeth are buried beneath a black marble slab with brass inscriptions in the South Stoke church chancel. The South Stoke manor passed to Joan, the daughter of Henry Rochford, and through marriage and purchase to Stanhope, Skeffington, Ellys, Fountain, Heale and Harrison families. In 1637 Sir John Harrison passed by moiety the manor to his daughter Margaret (1627‚Äì1679), who married Edmund Turnor Esqu (1619‚Äì1707).

Architecture St Andrew and St Mary's is of ashlar and limestone rubble construction. It comprises a chancel with north and south side-chapels, a nave, north and south aisles, a west tower, a north porch, and a south vestry, and is of Norman and Perpendicular period and style, with elements of Decorated and Early English. =Exterior= Tower from the west The tower is of three stages. The lower stages might be part of an 11th- century previously unbuttressed tower, and contains at its west side an early 15th-century chamfered reveal window opening with pointed arch surrounded by a hood mould with label stops in human form. The inset Perpendicular window is of three lights of panel tracery below, and six above. The panels are headed with trefoils, the lower within ogee heads. A church clock is just below the belfry stage. Between the window and clock is a hooded slit window, a repeat slit window is on the north and south sides. The Belfry stage was added in the 13th century and is defined at its base by a string course with repeating dentils. Central to each side of the belfry stage is a chamfered window opening with a plain hood mould following a semi-circular head. Within the opening are louvered and pointed twin-lights, these separated by a central octagonal shaft with a trefoil opening above in the north and south windows. The roof line is defined by a further string course with repeated grotesque bosses, and pairs of gargoyle drains on each side. An embattled roof parapet with crocketed corner pinnacles sits above. The tower is partially clasped at the north and south by the church aisles, and on the north side by an ashlar three-stepped angled buttress against the lower stages. Clerestory and tower above the south aisle and vestry The nave is defined by the clerestory above the abutted north and south aisle roofs. The clerestory contains three clear glazed windows on the north wall and three on the south, each of twin-lights surrounded by shallow-top arches within deep hood moulds. The windows at the south are point-headed and of plain tracery, those at the north round-headed with cinquefoil cusping‚Äîlobes formed by the overlapping of five circles. The clerestory parapet is of plain stone construction, overhangs the wall, and has a coped top. North aisle and porch Attached to the nave are the north and south aisles. The north aisle contains at its east two 19th-century windows of three lights set within a straight edge openings under gabled hood moulds. Tracery is of 15th-century panel style, with a central quatrefoil rosette inset, and reflects a true 15th-century window at the west wall. North aisle windows are clear glazed within diagonal muntins. A single step angled buttress supports the aisle north-east corner. To the west of the aisle north windows and above the east of the porch is the aisle roof's single gargoyle- headed drain. The gabled porch at the west of the windows is 13th-century, its doorway with a pointed chamfered arch from the spring of part octagonal responds‚Äîhalf-piers attached to walls supporting an arch‚Äîwith octagonal capitals. Attached to the responds to the height of the capitals is a cast iron double-gate. The porch interior contains a stone bench each side, and an inner doorway with 14th-century three-mould arch and hood mould with label stops. The panelled porch door has metal-studded deep stiles and rails, the panels with intermediate and arch-headed mullions. The south aisle south and west windows reflect completely the style and date of those in the north aisle. Attached to the south aisle, and opposite the porch on the north, is a 19th-century gabled vestry‚Äînot evident in an 1806 plan‚Äîpartly set behind a wall and iron fence enclosure. The vestry window at the south is of a single light with panes of glear glazing set in square muntins, within a double chamfered arched surround with hood mould. At the west side of the vestry is a plank door within an ogee-headed moulded doorway. North chapel from north-west The 1448 south chapel sits on a moulded plinth which runs over two twin- stepped buttresses, one angled and central to the south wall, the other diagonal on the south-east corner. The buttresses are topped by square-based pinnacles with blind cusped panels, crocketed above gables at each side, the pinnacle at the south-east finished with a finial. The parapet is embattled with moulded coping, which runs as a gable end at the east end and includes a central cross above. At the roof line at the base of the parapet and the buttress tops runs a moulded cill band‚Äîangled projection that allows water to flow from a building face‚Äîwhich continues around the east side and follows the line of the gable end. Either side of the south wall buttress is a three light window with cinquefoil heads, with six panels above with trefoil heads, enclosed in a moulded surround, and set with stained glass. The window opening has a flattened arch above the spring with a following hood mould. The 1460‚Äì70 north chapel also sits on a moulded plinth. Its angle buttresses are similar style to the south chapel, including cill band, although four in number on the north wall defining three external bays with three windows. These and the chapel east window are all of three lights with simple 'Y' tracery and cinquefoil heads. East wall gargoyle The window hood moulds are similar to the south chapel but run into a further cill band around the north and east wall. Within the central bay of the north wall is a chapel doorway opening that breaks through the plinth. The opening is a twin-mould recess, with arch above surrounded by a hood mould. The door planking is set behind raised and studded rails and stiles with inset moulded blind lights. The chancel east wall between the chapels is plain except for a simple cill band above the roof line, and a shallow coped gable with a central cross above. The chancel east window is of three lights with cinquefoil heads set in a moulded frame. Pevsner states that the window \\"makes an odd east view with the chancel east window, smaller, recent, and straight-headed, between.\\" Two spouts, dressed with gargoyle heads, drain the roof between the chancel and the chapels. =Interior= The interior dimensions of the church give the nave and side aisles at , and the chancel and chancel chapels at long. Both the nave and chancel are wide. The north chancel chapel is wide and the north aisle, . Both the south chancel chapel and south aisle are wide. Pevsner describes the interior as \\"sadly scraped\\"‚Äîscraping a typical 19th-century restoration method of cleaning and retooling. Nave from the chancel The 13th-century double- chamfered pointed tower arch is supported by twin octagonal responds. Sitting at the base of the tower arch is a 19th-century octagonal stone font. The bowl is panelled on each side with inset fields containing cusped and quatrefoil mouldings, floriate details at its base, all partly painted. A painted rim imitating cable moulding runs around the font rim and moulding on the plinth. On the font is a painted font cover by Christopher Turnor to the design of staircase panels at Stoke Rochford Hall. The font cover panel paintings, depicting the childhood of Christ, are by Jessie Bayes, who also painted the image \\"Our Lord in Glory\\" on the down face of the lowered chancel ceiling.\\"Jessie Bayes\\", Clerkenwell Fine Art. 1 February 2015 The nave north arcade is Norman and might date from before 1150 and be part of the earlier structure which also contained the west tower. It is of three bays defined by circular piers topped by square abaci with scalloped cushion capitals, supporting chamfered semi-circular arches. The nave south arcade is early 13th century and Perpendicular. The piers supporting the semi-circular arches are narrower than those at the north, the arches having deeper chamfered reveals. The capitals are frustum-style of four facets, with abaci of floriate detailing reminiscent of crocketing, except that on the pier respond at the west carved as flat leaf. In both aisles either side of the nave are rows of pews, provided by Sir Edmund Turnor in 1700. Within the south aisle are two stained glass windows. The chamfered chancel arch sits on polygonal responds with part octagonal capitals in which are embossed and painted cyphers of King George VI between lily floral motifs on one, and rose on the other. East arcade between the chancel and south chapel The nave arcades run through to corresponding chancel arcades separating the north and south chancel chapels from the chancel. The chancel three-bay north arcade is 14th-century Decorative, with piers quatrefoil in section separated by right-angled projections running full length, and with flat raised fillets along each face. The capital gadrooned (convex and concave) raised acabi mouldings follow the lateral line of the cusped piers. The 15th-century arcade arches springing from the piers are also of a continuous Decorative multi-faceted moulding with a flat under-face. The chancel south arcade is 15th-century. Its piers are Perpendicular, with polygonal piers and capitals and chamfered arches. The furthest east south arcade contains within it a supplementary Decorative arch springing from the piers, this of ogee form with multi-rounded moulding, topped with a twin run of decorative battlements leading to a flat topped finial; this arch was rebuilt in the 19th century. At each side within the westernmost chancel bays are 19th-century wooden choir stalls. Screens facing the stalls are of cusped ogee arches and quatrefoils in open fretwork moulding; the altar rail is of similar style. Behind the stalls are pews, originally belonging to the manor houses of Easton and Stoke Rochford. Between the aisles and chancel chapels at the north and south are 19th-century low wooden screens, with a run of seven double panels; plain below, those above with decorative insets, the central and outer of quatrefoils. Above the paneling runs open fretwork moulding of cusped ogee arches leading to quatrefoils between, below a top rail. Beneath the chancel east window is a 1911 stone reredos sculptured in relief, and painted, by Mrs. G. F. Watts. A raised central panel depicts the crucifixion of Christ with, at each side, three saints within triple-arched niches: the saints Hugh of Lincoln and Gilbert of Sempringham, and the Virgin Mary to the left; St John, Bishop King of Lincoln and St Christopher to the right. The base projection contains a scalloped bed-mould. A decorative frieze of serpentine foliage is set at the top. Above the reredos is the Perpendicular-style three-light east window with 19th-century stained glass. The north chapel contains a parish chest of wood held with metal straps, in the east wall a piscina with moulded and pointed surround, and against the north wall the church organ. The south chapel piscina is ogee-headed. Memorials The church monuments and memorials are divided almost exclusively between those of the Turnor family of Stoke Rochford in the north aisle and chapel, and the Chomeley family of Easton in the south aisle and chapel. =North chapel and north aisle= North chapel Turnor reredos memorial Beneath the window on the east wall of the north chapel is an 1896 \\"fine memorial\\" sepulchral reredos to Christopher Turnor (1809‚Äì1886) and his wife Lady Caroline (Finch-Hatton), designed by Turnor himself. Christopher Turnor undertook the rebuilding of Stoke Rochford Hall in 1846, was an MP for South Lincolnshire, and was a designer and provider of Lincolnshire farm complexes. Lady Caroline was the daughter of George Finch- Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea.Massue, Melville Henry, Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval (1911); The Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal: The Mortimer-Percy Volume, pp. 129, 130, 392.

Retrieved 1 February 2015 The memorial is of white marble. The table pedestal is faced with twelve twinned column reliefs, leading to ogee headed and cusped arches, with quatrefoils in circular devices between each. Above are three decorative gabled and pinnacled relief structures supported by slender columns, with inset niches containing saints, inscriptions, and geometric and floriated details, separated by a crocketed frieze. Two panels between contain roundels with profile relief portraits within a circular moulding. North chapel floor slab perhaps to John and Elizabeth de Neville The Christopher Turnor monument sits on a black-and-white marble-tiled raised level. Within this level is set a worn sculpted medieval monument, supposed the early 14th-century memorial to John de Neville and his wife, with two recumbent figures‚Äîthe man in chain armour, the woman with a wimple‚Äîdraped from elbow to ankle and set within a sunken field. A dog lies at the feet of each figure, and a shield with three Fleur-de-lis lies partly over the man. Set into the raised floor against the north wall is a recessed table tomb with inset panels with angels holding shields, above which is a curved and moulded canopy arch with embedded fleuron repeats and a crocketed top running to a cross-shaped floriate finial. The origin of the monument is unknown. Next to the de Neville monument and set into a marble tile is a lozenge-shaped metal plaque to Florence Amy Laura Neville (died 1934 aged 85 years), daughter of Henry Martin Turnor who was the son of antiquarian Edmund Turnor (1755‚Äì1829) and brother of Christopher Turnor (1809‚Äì1886). On the north wall of the north chapel is a white marble plaque set on a black relief background with curved top, dedicated to John Turnor of Stoke Rochford and Panton House, who died at Leamington Spa in 1845, aged 79 years, and to his sister, Frances Turnor, who died at Cheltenham in 1847, aged 83 years. Both were the children of a further Edmund Turnor (died 1806), and the siblings of Edmund Turnor (1755‚Äì1829). The memorial text is set within a recessed panel; a base moulding is supported by square brackets on an apron below, and a moulded cornice with plain pediment sits above. North chancel chapel monument to Edmund Turnor (1619‚Äì1707) On the same wall, immediately to the west, is a tall by wide monument completely of figured black or white marble, erected by Edmund Turnor (1619‚Äì1707) during his lifetime. Sitting on a white stepped base, and attached to a white back plate which runs to the entablature, is a pedestal. The pedestal's central panel contains inscriptions within a white bolection mould. Set back on either side are inset white oblong raised panels‚Äîthe top has a projected moulding following the plinth's horizontal facets. Above is an aedicule of inscriptions on a black field with wide white bolection mould surround, contained between a column each side of black shaft, and white base, stylobate and ionic capital, beneath the entablature. The entablature contains a white architrave with a plain black frieze above. From the front face of the cornice hangs two heraldic shields. The curved pediment is segmented, with the central open part containing a decorative urn. The inscriptions on the monument appear white, but were reported in 1806 as gilded. The upper panel inscription is to Sir Edmund Turnor‚Äîbrother of Sir Christopher Turnor (1607‚Äì1675), Baron of the Exchequer in 1660‚Äîand his wife, Dame Margaret (1627‚Äì1679). Turnor, knighted in 1663, was the youngest son of Christopher Turnor (died 1619) of Milton Erneyst, and was the first Turnor to take possession of the Stoke Rochford estates through marriage settlement for Margaret, the daughter of Sir John Harrison of Balls Park, Hertfordshire and his wife, Margaret, of Fanshawe Gate Hall, Derbyshire. The pedestal inscription is to John Turnor, son to Sir Edmund and Dame Margaret. John Turnor was buried at Bath Abbey in 1719. He married Diana (buried 1736), the only child of Algernon Cecil, son to the Earl of Salisbury. John and Diana's only surviving son, Edmund, was buried at Grantham in 1763. Edmund had married Elizabeth, co-heir of Henry Ferne of Snitterton Hall, Derbyshire. Elizabeth was buried at Hammersmith in 1763. Also recorded is John (died 1752), the younger son of Edmund and Elizabeth, who was captain in the King's Regiment of Dragoon Guards in the battles of Detingen and Fonteny, and died at Kirmond, near where he was buried.Rigg, James McMullen; \\"Turnor, Christopher\\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 57 In the north aisle there are further Turnor plaques including one at the west end for Herbert Broke Turnor (1848‚Äì1881), son of Christopher and Lady Caroline Turnor, who died \\"In the Mountains of Thibet 75 miles from Ladak\\", erected by his brother Algernon. The plaque, on a black surround, is square white marble with an inset field with cut squares at each corner establishing a cross device. Each square is further cut with a cross inside a quatrefoil. Plaque to Christopher Randolph Turnor An oblong marble plaque of white field with black framing, and containing an embossed heraldic shield surmounted by a lion crest, is to Christopher Randolph Turnor (1886‚Äì1914), who was a lieutenant in the 10th Royal Hussars, killed near Ypres, Belgium, and buried in Zandvoorde; he was the son of Algernon and Lady Henrietta Turnor. Above this plaque are two others, both of a black recessed field, surrounded by a raised figured pink and white marble frame incised with flat straight grooves and square corner devices with embossed details. One is dedicated firstly to Elizabeth Turnor (died 1801 aged 27), first wife of Edmund Turnor (1755‚Äì1829), and daughter of Philip Bowes Broke (commander of HMS Shannon in the capture of USS Chesapeake); and secondly to Edmund Turnor's second wife Dorothea (died 1874 aged 77 years). The second is to Edmund Turnor (died 1806 aged 89 years)‚Äîwho was the father of Edmund Turnor (1755‚Äì1829)‚Äîand his wife Mary (died 1818 aged 86 years). A further memorial of double dedication is of a white bolection moulding surrounding two raised plaques on a black field; all marble. Both dedications mention Reginald Charles Turnor (1850‚Äì1910); the first for his first wife Gabrielle (died 1898 at Cannes), the daughter to Marquis Sampieri, and whose ashes are held behind the memorial; the second for his death as a major of 1st Life Guards, and the husband of Laura Leticia Turnor. Below this double dedication is a plaque to Laura Letitia Turnor (1872‚Äì1952).Memorial and monument inscriptions There are three funerary hatchments: two in the north aisle and one over the tower arch, according to English Heritage all 18th-century. =South chapel and south aisle= Monument to Henry and Elizabeth Cholmeley The major monument at the south is that erected against the wall of the south chancel chapel by Montague Cholmeley in February 1641. The monument, free standing, is dedicated to Cholmeley's parents, Henry Cholmeley (died 1632), son to Sir Henry Cholmeley (died 1620) and Alice, the daughter of William Lacey of Stamford; and Elizabeth (died 1631), daughter to Sir Richard Sondes of Sheldwich, Kent. Sir Henry Cholmeley was the first of the family to take the manor of Easton, and was descended from the Cholmeley's of Cheshire. Montague Cholmeley's wife was Elizabeth, daughter to Sir Edward Hartop of Buckminster in Leicestershire. The monument is described by Kelly's Directory as: \\"richly carved and gilt, and upon the base within arched recesses are kneeling effigies of the parents, and in smaller recesses effigies of two sons; intermediate columns support a cornice of panel work, enriched with armorial bearings and ornaments\\" The stone monument was originally completely painted and gilded. Henry and Elizabeth sit within an aedicule and kneel facing each other in prayer either side of a gabled ark, in front of which lies a covered small child with head on pillow. Columns flank the figures, beyond which kneels a further figure of a son each side, set in front of an arched recess under a portico of four columns, and slightly set back; plinths above the canopies are topped with plain square tapered black columns as pinnacles. The columns either side of Henry and Elizabeth are headed by Corinthian capitals that sit beneath an architrave, frieze and cornice that continue across the monument but set back. Below the set back frieze, and enclosing scrollwork and a memorial plaque, is a chamfered arch with a spandrel each side containing a roundel with embossed decoration. On the frieze run recessed oblong panels separated by relief heads. Above the cornice the line of the columns is continued by plinths, supporting tapered pinnacles topped by moulding and ball. Above the set back cornice is a complete heraldic achievement set within square columns decoratively embossed, and with scrollwork as support at the sides, and topped by a further architrave, frieze and cornice reflecting those below, above which is further scrollwork. Other Cholmeley family members buried underneath the south aisle and chapel are commemorated by inscription on the monument: *Robert, son of Henry Cholmeley and Elizabeth Sondes *Mary, daughter of Montague Cholmeley and Elizabeth Hartop, who died in 1639 \\"having lived only 18 days\\" *Penelope (died 1760 aged 45 years), wife of John Cholmeley and daughter to Joseph Herne of Twyford, Middlesex *Penelope's (above) infant children: Montague, Henry, and Henry (two children survived: Montague and Penelope) *John Cholmeley (died 1768 aged 64 years), husband of Penelope (above), eldest son to James and Catherine Cholmeley *Montague Cholmeley (died 1700), the eldest son of Montague Cholmeley by his first wife, Alice Brownlowe; an adjoining monument was erected by Cholmeley to his second wife Elizabeth (died 1693), daughter of Richard Booth, Alderman of London. *Montague Cholmeley (died 1652), founder of the monument to his father, husband to Elizabeth Hartop with issue of eight children *John (died 1711), a London merchant who died unmarried and was the brother of Montague Cholmeley *Robert (died 1721), a merchant 25 years in C√°diz, and 19 in London, and the youngest brother of Montague Cholmeley *James (died 1735 aged 50 years), son of Montague Cholmeley and Elizabeth Hartop. He married Catherine Woodfine whose father, John, was a merchant at Ratley in Buckinghamshire. James and Catherine produced fourteen children; ten survived, four died in infancy. *Catherine Cholmeley (died 1770 aged 89 years), widow of James Cholmeley *Mary Cholmeley (died 1737 aged 23 years) *Henry Cholmeley (died 1737 aged 20 years), died returning from Mocha during his third voyage to the East Indies * Montague Cholmeley (died 1803 aged 60 years), the only son of John and Penelope Cholmeley. Montague married Sarah, daughter to Humphry Sibthorpe M. D. of Oxford, produced fourteen children, ten of whom survived South chapel east window dedicated to Montague Aubrey Rowley Cholmeley The south chapel east window is dedicated to Sir Montague Aubrey Rowley Cholmeley, 4th Baronet, (1876‚Äì1914), who, as a captain in the Grenadier Guards, was killed in action near Festubert during the First World War. Each side of the Edmund Chomeley monument is a stained glass window, the one to the west dedicated to Sir Hugh Arthur Henry Cholmeley (1839‚Äì1904), 3rd Baronet, and erected by his wife and children. A further stained glass window dedicated to Lady Cholmeley, widow of Hugh Arthur Henry Cholmeley, was erected in 1911. At the west of the south chancel chapel is a wall monument to Alice (died 1678 aged 24 years), the wife of Montague Cholmeley, and the daughter of Sir Richard Brownlow of Great Humby and sister of Sir John, and William Brownlow. Alice produced five children to Montague, three of whom‚ÄîJohn, Alice and Mary‚Äîpredeceased her. The monument is white marble, its plaque inscription within a field set below flat moulding with part inset quarter-circles at bottom left and right. The plaque is supported by scallop shell and scrolling with swagged and tied ribbon motifs each side. Above the plaque is a cornice, the top of which is a deep curved cushion moulding with raised scallops. Above the cornice is a heraldic shield vertically divided red and brown, with helm and crest above. On the south aisle wall are three monuments all of white marble on black marble back plates. One is to Mrs Penelope Cholmeley (died 1821 aged 75 years), the sister of Montague Chomeley. Her remains were interred at Twyford, Middlesex. The monument back plate is straight sided with top and bottom curved and facetted. The raised inscription plaque is oblong with a 45¬∞ cut at each corner, over which is a moulded shelf, on which sits an urn with 'cloth' swagging attached and topped with a flambeau. Floriate devices are a boss each side of the urn, bell flower ribbons hanging from the shelf either side of the plaque, and an oval flower and leaf spray below. The second is a double dedication: firstly to Sir Montague Cholmeley (died 1851 aged 59 years); secondly to Dame Elizabeth, his wife (died 1822), daughter and co-heiress of John Harrison of Norton Place, north from Lincoln. This monument back plate is straight sided with top deeply curved and bottom partly curved. The raised inscription plaque is rectilinear, and sits on a square-edged stepped shelf supported by curved brackets with embossed acanthus decoration, with a device of two strapped palm leaves below. At each side of the plaque is a hanging folded drape attached to a moulded cornice. At each side of the cornice top is a conch shell which provides the holding point for a plain swag that springs from a knot above; between the swagging is a raised cross. The monument was provided by George Wilcox of Piccadilly. Above this monument is one smaller to James Harrison Cholmeley (1808‚Äì1854), of a scrolled plaque on a straight sided back plate with a pointed top; above the scroll sits a decorative crest. A war memorial is to members of the Cholmeley family: six who died during the First World War, and one on the 1919 Murmansk Front. Its inscription plaque is white marble with red lettering. This sits within a bolection mould, on a moulded bracketed shelf and beneath an entablature and pediment, all of figured cream marble. A black column with Corinthian capital is each side of the plaque. Within a segmented pediment is an escutcheon on a white marble scrolled background surmounted by a crest of griffin holding a helm. On the south aisle west wall is a plaque with cross above, all of brass decoratively incised. It is dedicated to Lady Georgina Wentworth (1809‚Äì1880), who was the wife of Sir Montague Cholmeley M.P. of Easton Hall and Norton Place, and the daughter of the 8th Duke of St Albans. =Other memorials= Chancel altar chest tomb of unknown origin Within the chancel are two 15th-century stone chest tombs, one either side of the altar. The tomb at the north is panelled with quatrefoils enclosing plain shields; that at the south panelled with cusped ogee arches and plain shields. There are no inscriptions, and no information on their origin. Brasses on chancel burial slabs are to Oliver St John (d.1497), his wife Elizabeth (d.1503), and Elizabeth's former husband Henry Rochford (d.1470).

Education and Academic Career  Caves obtained his BA in economics at Oberlin College in 1953. He continued his studies at Harvard University, where he obtained his MA in economics in 1956, and his PhD in 1958.Richard E. Caves, Marc J. Roberts, Brookings Institution (1974). Regulating the product: quality and variety. p. 269H. W. de Jong, William G. Shepherd (2007) Pioneers of Industrial Organization: How the Economics of Competition and Monopoly Took Shape. p. 250 In 1957, Caves embarked on his academic career in the Department of Economics, chaired by Joe S. Bain, at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1962, he moved back to Harvard University, where he was appointed Professor of Economics and lectured in industrial organization and international trade. He served as Department Chairman from 1966 to 1969, and as Chairman of the Ph.D programme in Business Economics from 1984 to 1997. He was also appointed as the George Gund Professor of Economics and Business Administration from 1986 to 1997, and subsequently as the Nathaniel Ropes Research Professor of Political Economy, from 1997 on. He retired from Harvard in 2003, and became Emeritus Professor of Economics. He also sat on the editorial board of the Review of Economics and Statistics from 1992 to 1996. Consultancy Work Caves acted as a consultant on various topics to various bodies. He was an adviser on international monetary problems for the US Council of Economic Advisers in 1961, and deputy to the Special Assistant to the President on foreign trade policy in the same year. From 1963-4 he was a member of the Review Committee for Balance of Payments Statistics at the US Bureau of the Budget (also known as the Bernstein Committee). In 1964, he was appointed as a member of the White House Task Force on Foreign Economic Policy. From 1972-3, he acted as a consultant to the Council of Ontario Universities, and from 1975-6 he was a consultant to the Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration. Contributions to Creative Industries Caves specialized in industrial and political economics, and authored several books on industrial efficiency, productivity, and competition. Using this as background, Caves went on to provide new insights into the economics of the artistic and creative endeavour by examining the organization of creative industries. In a seminal work, Creative Industries: Contracts Between Art and Commerce, Caves examined a wide range of visual and performing arts ‚Äì including cinema and television, theatre, music, book publishing, and toys and games ‚Äì in order to investigate how the theory of contracts and the logic of economic organization affect the production of \\"simple creative goods\\" (like art), as well as more \\"complex goods\\" (such as theatre plays or motion pictures), which require teams of artists with diverse talents. According to Caves' analysis, art collectors and moviegoers are consumers; gallery owners are \\"gatekeepers\\"; and critics are \\"certifiers.\\" In this respect, his work comes close to that of the American sociologist, Howard S. Becker, who, two decades earlier, put forward a theory of art worlds.Howard S. Becker, Art Worlds. Berkeley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. However his approach was strictly that of an economist, as he theorised that the organization and practices of all creative industries could be analysed according to seven \\"economic properties\\". These were: (1) time flies, the fact that all creative work is subject to tight deadlines and has to be completed by a particular date; (2) infinite variety, meaning that no two creative products are the same and, as a result, cannot be standardised; (3) nobody knows, referring to the vagaries of an uncertain market where success or failure of a creative product cannot be determined in advance; (4) A list / B list, a ranking of both organisations and individual personnel as a means to combat market uncertainties through recognised talent; (5) motley crew, whereby all creative products, to a greater or lesser extent, rely on cooperation among different personnel with different skill sets; (6) art for art's sake, meaning that creative products differ from other mass-produced commodities because they rely on aesthetic or artistic inputs; and (7) ars longa, referring to the cumulation of copyrights by film studios, publishing houses, and other creative industry organisations. Over the years since its publication, the attention paid to Caves's work on creative industries has borne out the early comment by sociologist Paul DiMaggio that his book \\"promises to be a much-needed touchstone for work in cultural economics, the sociology of art and culture, and the interdisciplinary field of arts and cultural policy analysis.\\" Scholars in economic geography, political science, anthropology, and cultural studies have all taken Caves's work as their starting point in their own analyses of different forms of creative industries ‚Äì primarily in the United States and Europe, but also in the Asian region (in particular, perhaps, Japan Brian Moeran, The Business of Creativity: Toward an Anthropology of Worth.

Background After leaving Sun Records in 1963 for Smash, Lewis embarked on what is often referred to as his \\"wilderness years,\\" characterized by constant touring and periodic recording dates that produced albums which failed to make any significant impact in the charts. In 1965, producers Shelby Singleton and Jerry Kennedy opted to cut a country-themed album on Lewis under the title Country Songs for City Folks, although the title was about as far as the concept went; the songs were straight forward readings of recent chart hits that featured Lewis's trademark piano style and soulful singing. In the early 1960s, country stars such as Marty Robbins, who released Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs in 1959, and Lewis's fellow Sun contemporary Johnny Cash, who began recording a string of themed albums beginning with Ride This Train in 1960, had pioneered the \\"concept album\\" in country music, and this approach was taken with Lewis. Recording As Joe Bonomo observes in his book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, part of the reason for the lack of original tunes on the album was that \\"Jerry Lee's iffy chart life had had the predictable consequence of few songwriters knocking on his door,\\" and that the collection of recent hits \\"infused the album with a contemporary feel, but underscored the crass 'covers' feel of the enterprise.\\" Nonetheless, the album foreshadows Lewis's re-emergence as a country megastar later in the decade, as he gives committed readings to songs from a genre that he had demonstrated a mastery of when he took \\"You Win Again\\" to number 4 in 1957. Country Songs for City Folks might be best remembered for introducing Welshman and Lewis fan Tom Jones to the song \\"Green Green Grass of Home\\"; after hearing Jerry Lee's rendition, he rushed into the studio and recorded his own version, which became an international hit. Jerry Lee's younger sister Linda Gail Lewis sings on the Gold-rush saga \\"North to Alaska\\". Reception Country Songs for City Folks did not crack the Billboard chart, although it did rise to number 39 on the country albums chart when it was released again under the title All Country in the wake of Lewis's comeback four years later. Bruce Eder of AllMusic calls it \\"an astoundingly good country album,\\" singling out the performances on Willie Nelson's \\"Funny How Time Slips Away\\" and Hank Thompson's honky-tonk lament \\"The Wild Side of Life.\\" In 2009, biographer Joe Bonomo observed that the lesser tracks on the album betray Smash's conservatism, citing the \\"innocuous folk-pop\\" of \\"Walk Right In\\" and \\"King of the Road\\" and the \\"superfluous\\" versions of \\"Ring of Fire\\" and a third recording of \\"Crazy Arms.\\" In 2014, Lewis admitted to biographer Rick Bragg, \\"That was a hangup for me, tryin' to do a song that's already been a multimillion seller. You don't tackle somethin' like that. That wasn't Jerry Kennedy's fault. That was my fault. I said, 'I wanna do 'Detroit City.'

She ran three times as a two-year-old, winning on her first two starts including the Debutante Stakes. Her greatest success came in 2014 when she won the 2014 Yorkshire Oaks ending the Oaks and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Taghrooda's unbeaten record. She will stay in training as a 4 year old in 2015.  Background  Tapestry is a bay filly, she is her dam Rumplestiltskin's 3rd foal. Her sire is Galileo meaning she is breed on the same Danehill Galileo cross that has produced leading horses like Frankel, Teofilo and Roderic O'Connor. She is a full sister to John F Kennedy. She is trained by Aidan O'Brien and owned by John Magnier's wife Sue and running in her famous navy blue silks.  Two Year-Old Career  Tapestry's career began in July 2013 in a maiden race at the Curragh. She was trainer Aidan O'Brien's second string with his son Joseph O'Brien riding the 6/4 joint favourite Snow. With 1 furlong to travel tapestry was 5th but quickened to win by half a length under a ride by Seamie Heffernan. She returned to the Curragh in August to contest the Group 2 Debutante Stakes. She was one of 6 fillies in the race, 3 of them trained by Aidan O'Brien. The 4/5 favourite was asked to quicken by Joseph O'Brien in the closing stages overtaking stablemate Perhaps to win by 1 and 3/4 lengths. The win caused some bookmakers to cut their ante post odds on her winning the 1000 Guineas. Aidan O'Brien said after the race she could be aimed at the Moyglare Stud Stakes. For her final start of 2013 Tapestry ran in the Molyglare stud stakes, one of the leading races for 2 year old fillies with many past winners going on to win the 1000 Guineas. She was supplemented late for the race at a cost of ‚Ç¨22,500. This race matched her against Kiyoshi who had won the Albany Stakes, Kiyoshi started 13/8 favourite with Tapestry at 2/1. The race was won by the Queen Anne Stakes winner Rizeena at a price of 9/2. Tapestry passed the winning post in the third place but a stewards enquiry found Jamie Spencer's filly Kiyoshi, who finished 2nd, to have interfered with her run and reversed the placings. After the race Aidan O'Brien praised her performance \\"She ran very well, As for the rest of this year, she has the option of going for the Fillies' Mile at Newmarket or we might just leave her off for the rest of the season.\\"  Three Year-Old Career  During a stable tour in early 2014 Aidan O'Brien revealed Tapestry would be sent straight to the 1000 Guineas without a prep run. She and Rizeena dominated the Ante post betting for the Guineas but mid April bookmakers began to lengthen their prices on tapestry due to the amount of bets on her rival. Tapestry was joined in the Guineas by fellow Aidan O'Brien filly Bracelet, who had one the 1000 Guineas Trial Stakes and was ridden by Ryan Moore. On the day of the race a large number of bets before the off saw Tapestry's price shorten from 6/1 to 4/1 making her favourite for the race. She raced competitively for the first few furlongs but as the leaders began to quicken she had nothing to give with Joseph O'Brien pulling her up to finish in last place behind winner Miss France. Later Aidan O'Brien blamed himself for the flop as he knew she wasn't 100% fit for the race and should never have run her. He also ruled her out of running in the Irish 1000 Guineas. Despite at one stage being the Ante post favourite Tapestry was scratched from The Oaks and instead was entered in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot 2 weeks later. She never looked to threaten and finished 6th behind Rizeena. Her first Irish appearance of 2014 was in the Irish Oaks. Joseph O'Brien chose to ride her over his Epsom Oaks ride Marvellous. She finished 2nd to Bracelet, ridden by Colm O'Donoghue, despite stumbling out of the starting stalls and knocking her saddle to her rump. A month later Tapestry was entered in the Yorkshire Oaks to face John Gosden's star filly Taghrooda who had made history becoming the first oaks winner to win the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Ryan Moore was enlisted to ride her with Joseph O'Brien riding last years runner up Venus de Milo. Connections of Taghrooda were confident in the filly and unsurprisingly bookies made her 1/5 to win. In the race Volume made the running with Taghrooda taking over in the home straight, Paul Hanagan pushed her along however Moore was able to get Tapestry ahead of her to win by a length ending her unbeaten run. Aidan O'Brien said \\"She went weak from halfway in the Guineas, which was probably down to pushing her in the spring, She had a break after that and the lads have done an unbelievable job to get her back. What she did in the [Irish] Oaks was extraordinary and Ryan produced her unbelievably today.\\" It was reported Tapestry's need start would be back over a mile in the Matron Stakes, billed as a rematch with Rizeena. Joseph O'Brien was back in the saddle having ridden Tapestry's younger brother John F Kennedy to victory in the Juvenile Turf Stakes earlier in the day. Despite starting second favourite at 9/4 Tapestry finished 9th of the 10 runners. Despite an entry in the Prix de l'Op√©ra at Longchamp Racecourse Tapestry was supplemented for the 2014 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at a cost of ‚Ç¨120,000. Ridden by Ryan Moore she finished 13th behind Tr√©v√©.https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/results/2014-10-05/longchamp/146160/qatar- prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-group-1  Pedigree   References  Category:2011 racehorse births Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland ","title":"Tapestry (horse)"},{"id":"45278116","text":"Communist Movement of Galicia (Galician: Movemento Comunista de Galiza, MCG) was a communist political party created in Galicia during the last years of the dictatorship of Franco as the Galician section of the Communist Movement, although in practice the MCG acted as an independent party.Beramendi, Xusto and N√∫√±ez Seixas, O Nacionalismo Galego.

He was a primary founder and organizer of the Virginia Military Institute, and was one of its first two faculty members. He also served in the Confederate military during the American Civil War. Early life J. T. L. Preston was born in Lexington, Virginia on April 25, 1811. He was raised in Lexington and Richmond, and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in 1828. Preston subsequently attended graduate courses at the University of Virginia and Yale University. He then studied law, attained admission to the bar, and started a practice in Lexington. In 1881 he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Washington and Lee. Founding the Virginia Military Institute In the years after the War of 1812, the state of Virginia built and maintained several arsenals to store weapons intended for use by the state militia in the event of invasion or insurrection. In the 1830s Preston belonged to a Lexington debate club known as the Franklin Society. In 1836 Preston made the case to the society that the arsenal in Lexington could be put to better use as a normal school for providing education on practical subjects, as well as military training to individuals who could be expected to serve as officers in the militia if needed. After debate and revision of the original proposal, the Franklin Society voted in favor of Preston's concept. After a public relations campaign that included Preston meeting in person with influential business, military and political figures, letters to the editor from Preston writing under a pen name, and letters to the editor and open letters from supporters including Norwich University founder Alden Partridge, in 1836 the Virginia legislature passed a bill authorizing creation of a normal school at the Lexington arsenal, and the Governor signed the measure into law. The organizers of the planned school formed a board of visitors, which included Preston, and the board selected Claudius Crozet to serve as their President. The board delegated to Preston the task of deciding what to call the new school, and he created the name Virginia Military Institute. Preston was also tasked with hiring VMI's first superintendent. He was persuaded that West Point graduate and army officer Francis Henney Smith, then on the faculty at Hampden-Sydney College, was the most suitable candidate. Preston successfully recruited Smith, convincing him to become the first superintendent of VMI and professor of tactics. After Smith agreed to accept the superintendent's position, Preston applied to join the faculty, and was hired as Professor of Languages. Classes began in 1839, and Preston specialized in Latin, and also taught English and other modern languages. Early years of VMI Smith held the militia rank of colonel as commander of VMIs Corps of Cadets. Preston was appointed a captain, and soon advanced to major. In addition to serving as the Corps' quartermaster, he often acted as superintendent in Smith's absence. After John Brown's 1859 trial and sentence, Smith was appointed to oversee the execution, and along with almost all of the Virginia Militia, the Corps of Cadets was assigned to provide security in Charles Town, where Brown was to be hanged. Preston participated in his role as quartermaster, and observed the execution. He wrote a letter to his wife in which he described in detail the events surrounding the execution. This letter was published in several newspapers, and provided an important firsthand account of the event. According to contemporary accounts, it was Preston who broke the silence that followed Brown's death, declaring to the crowd \\"So perish all such enemies of Virginia! All such enemies of the Union! All such enemies of the human race!\\" Civil War military service During the American Civil War Preston sided with the Confederacy and was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the 9th Virginia Infantry, of which Smith was colonel and commander. Preston served with the 9th Virginia during various actions in the Shenandoah Valley, including time on the staff of and as aide-de-camp for Stonewall Jackson. Post-Civil War After the war Preston continued as a member of the VMI faculty until retiring in 1882. He was promoted to colonel in the militia, but declined a promotion to brigadier general. Church leadership Preston was active in the Presbyterian Church. He was the ruling elder of Lexington's church for nearly 50 years, and was a delegate to numerous state and national church leadership meetings. For over 20 years before and after the Civil War Preston, Stonewall Jackson and others led a Sunday school for Lexington's African-Americans, both slaves and those who were free. Retirement and death In retirement Preston continued to reside at his home in Lexington. He died there on July 15, 1890 and was buried at Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery in Lexington. Family Preston married twice. In 1832 he married Sarah Lyle Caruthers. After her death, he married Margaret Junkin in 1857. He had seven children with his first wife and two with his second. Margaret Junkin Preston was the daughter of a former president of Washington College, and became a major nineteenth century literary figure, known nationally as the \\"Poetess of the South\\" and \\"The Poetess of the Confederacy\\". Margaret Junkin's sister Elinor was the first wife of Stonewall Jackson. Legacy The Preston Library at Virginia Military Institute is named for him. His former home, Blandome has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2002.http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Lexington/117-0027-0127_Blandome_2002_Final_Nomination.pdf Preston is the subject of a biography, 2014's The Father of Virginia Military Institute: A Biography of Colonel J.T.L.

Financial problems plagued the league and its member teams throughout their existence. It was not unusual for teams to depart the league during the season or for the league to cease operations without completing the season. It was this lack of financial support which ultimately caused the league to permanently disband in 1889. In 1901, a new league, called the Southern Association, was created from its remnants. History The original Southern League was formed on February 11, 1885, in Atlanta. It was the first professional league to operate in the South. Henry W. Grady, managing editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, was selected as the league's first president. The eight-team circuit included the Atlanta Atlantas, Augusta Browns, Chattanooga Lookouts, Columbus Stars, Memphis Reds, Nashville Americans, and unnamed teams from Birmingham, Alabama, and Macon, Georgia. Each team was scheduled to play 100 games during the season, but few would reach that mark as the Birmingham, Chattanooga, and Columbus clubs quit the league in the final two weeks of the season. Atlanta captured the Southern League's first pennant with their 66‚Äì32 (.673) season record. Nashville's Len Sowders was the league's first batting champion with a .309 batting average. Financial insolvency, a perpetual problem in the league, forced the teams from Augusta and Chattanooga to drop out of the league in July 1886. Atlanta repeated their previous winning season by capturing the 1886 league pennant with a 64‚Äì28 (.696) record. Lefty Marr, mirroring Nashville teammate Len Sowders' feat from the previous season, was the league's batting champion with a .327 batting average. Charleston Seagulls pitcher Gus Wehling had the lowest earned run average (0.78) for the season. A new entrant to the league, the New Orleans Pelicans, won the 1887 league pennant with a 74‚Äì40 (.649) record. Of the seven teams fielded during the 1887 season, only three (Charleston, Memphis, and New Orleans) made it to the end of the season on October 11; financial problems forced the others to drop out of the league. Wally Andrews of Memphis was the league's batting champion (.413). Only four teams were able to compete during the 1888 season. The season opened on April 7, was halted by early July. The league champion Birmingham Maroons compiled a 32‚Äì19 .(627) season. Memphis' John Sneed led the league with his .354 batting average. The league played again in 1889 but only fielded four teams, which was partially to blame for the failure of the 1888 season. After the first week or two of play, the Southern League reorganized by adding three other teams. The league collapsed again that season after only three teams remained active by the middle of the season. New Orleans (46‚Äì9, .836) was in first place at the time the league dissolved. The circuit was non-operational from 1890 to 1891. The Southern League started up again in 1892, and the Birmingham Grays (73‚Äì50, .593) won the league pennant. The 1893 Southern League featured the largest circuit in the league's history. The 12-team league was hampered by a poorly- designed schedule and insufficient financing which forced the owners of the Birmingham club, Charleston Seagulls, and Nashville Tigers to turn control of their teams over to the league, which continued to operate the clubs. A meeting was held on July 1, at which the league's president, Hart, resigned despite those in attendance asking him to reconsider. J.B. Nicklin of Chattanooga was elected as the new league president six days later. Between mid July and early August, The Birmingham team transferred to Pensacola, Florida, but soon found themselves quarantined from the rest of the league due to an outbreak of yellow fever. This development, in addition to ongoing financial debacles, caused the league to end the season on August 12. The Augusta Electricians were awarded the pennant for the first part of the season, and the Macon Central City/Hornets were awarded the pennant for the second half. Charlie Frank of Memphis won the league batting title with a .390 average. In 1894, some teams were forced to sell their players to other clubs in order to stay financially solvent, while others refused to continue play in the second half. Only Nashville, Mobile, New Orleans, and Memphis competed after the season's midpoint. This prompted the Southern League to call the rest of the season off nine games into the second half on July 7, 1894, as the result of league-wide financial instability brought on by the expense of travel and poor attendance. Memphis was awarded the pennant for having the best overall record. In the ensuing months, baseball leaders across the South considered which cities to include in the next iteration of the league. Representatives met at The Read House Hotel in Chattanooga on January 14 to reorganize for the 1895 season. Membership was granted to clubs in Atlanta, Chattanooga, Evansville, Little Rock, Memphis, Montgomery, Nashville, and New Orleans, thus lessening the expense of travel incurred in the past with the inclusion of cities such as Charleston and Savannah. Each of the eight teams paid a US$1,000 deposit to guarantee they would play the entire season. They also pledged to pay dues of $100 per month plus 3% of total gate receipts for a sinking fund. Player salaries were capped at $1,000 per team. The 1895 champion Nashville Seraphs The 1895 season saw the Chattanooga franchise being transferred to Mobile on June 19, Memphis disbanding on July 23, and Little Rock dropping out on July 27. Though the Atlanta Crackers and Nashville Seraphs ended the 1895 season tied for first place, a meeting of the league's directors resulted in the nullification of an August 10 game between the two in which the umpire improperly made an out call following fan interference. This ruling caused the Seraphs' winning percentage to rise to .676 (71‚Äì34) and Atlanta's to fall to .667 (68‚Äì34), making Nashville the pennant winner. Chattanooga/Mobile's Lew Whistler won the league batting title with a .404 batting average. The New Orleans Pelicans (67‚Äì30, .744) won their third league pennant in 1896, giving them more championships in the original Southern League than any other club. The league was in-operational in 1897 due to the lack of financial support. In 1898, the league made it as far as July 4 before shutting down again. The Augusta, Georgia, club was in first place at the time with a 20‚Äì8 (.714) record. The Southern League consisted of only four teams during its 1899 season. The Mobile Blackbirds (23‚Äì16, .590) were in first place when the league suspended operations on May 1. This was the final season of competition for the original Southern League‚Äîa lack of interest and financial support caused the league to fold for good. Two years later, in 1901, the Southern Association was created by Abner Powell, Charley Frank, and Ike Fisher out of the remnants of the Southern League. Teams Team nicknames were not official for most teams in the 19th century. Names were often bestowed by local sportswriters or civic leaders. As such, some records only provide the city a team represented with no moniker. *Atlanta (1889)a *Atlanta Atlantas (1885‚Äì86, 1894)d *Atlanta Colts (1898) *Atlanta Crackers (1895‚Äì96) *Atlanta

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The site, located on a terrace between Crockery Creek and the Grand River, was the location of a large Middle Woodland period village and burial mound complex. In 1856, John Spoon and his brother, Daniel, arrived in this location and constructed a sawmill. Eventually a small town, Spoonville, grew up around the site, and in 1871, was established as a station on the Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad. Spoon discovered three mounds on his property. One of these, reportedly long and high, was destroyed in the construction of the sawmill. The first archaeological investigation of the site was conducted by Able Anderson in 1857. Anderson excavated one of the mounds, reporting human remains and other artifacts. In 1876, William D. Gunning carried out further excavation at the site. In 1882, the rail line through Spoonville was torn up. John Spoon died in 1892. More recent excavations of the Spoonville site were made in 1962, and excavation of the village at the site continued through the next few decades.

It examines life during and after the USSR through the personal stories of five ordinary Russians, who speak about their Soviet childhood, the collapse of the USSR, and contemporary Russia.\\"My Perestroika,\\" About Growing Up in Russia - Review - NY Times, 22 March 2011 The film premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. In 2011, the documentary was awarded a Peabody Award. Plot There is no single narrator in the film. Instead, the stories are told by five inhabitants of Moscow, four of whom grew up together and were classmates from primary school through high school. Borya and Lyuba are a married couple and history teachers at a Moscow school. Andrei has thrived in the new Russian capitalism and has just opened a new store of French men's shirts. Olga, the prettiest girl in the class, is a single mother and works for a company that rents out billiard tables to bars and clubs all over Moscow. Ruslan was a famous Russian punk rock musician who rejects society's structures. Some of the topics that come up are conformity and rebellion, the attitudes towards the USSR and its collapse, the benefits and challenges of the transition to contemporary Russia, and the difference between the older and the younger generations. To tell these stories, Hessman combines first-person recollections, often filmed at the homes of the five protagonists, with home movies from the 1970s and 1980s, canonical Soviet and Russian music, and Soviet archival footage. Production Hessman spent about a decade living in Russia. She had lived in Russia in the 1990s, completing an MFA degree in Film Directing at the All-Russian State Institute of Cinematography () and working as the producer of the Russian version of Sesame Street ().

East Berkeley Street station, a street-level bus station on the Washington Street branch of the MBTA Silver Line bus rapid transit service, opened on the site in 2002. It is served by the SL4 and SL5 Silver Line routes as well as several local MBTA bus routes. Like all Silver Line stops, East Berkeley Street is accessible. History A southbound Silver Line bus at East Berkeley Street in 2011 The Washington Street Elevated, including Dover station, opened as part of the Main Line Elevated on June 10, 1901. It was originally built with a short center island platform, similar to Northampton station to the south. Like most of the other Elevated stations, both were designed in a Beaux Arts style by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr.. Mere months after opening, both stations had their platforms extended for four-car trains. Eleven years later, Dover was rebuilt with two eight-car-long side platforms in a more utilitarian style, with the new station opening on December 9, 1912. A temporary wooden station was used during construction. The Main Line Elevated was renamed the Orange Line in 1965. Dover station was closed on April 30, 1987, when the Washington Street Elevated was closed and the Orange Line was rerouted to the west along the Southwest Corridor. Silver Line service on Washington Street began on July 20, 2002, replacing the route 49 bus. Service levels doubled on October 15, 2009 with the introduction of the SL4 route.

It served the Washington Street Elevated, part of the MBTA's Orange Line. It was located over Egleston Square at the intersection of Washington Street and Columbus Avenue in the Roxbury neighborhood. The station opened in November 1909, and was closed in April 1987 when the Orange Line was rerouted to the west along the Southwest Corridor. History =Construction= Egleston station under construction in 1908 The Boston Elevated Railway constructed the Washington Street Elevated from downtown Boston to in 1901; an extension to was approved on January 4, 1904 and began construction on May 2, 1906. Construction of the elevated structure proceeded southbound and reached Egleston Square on August 20, 1906, although construction on the station did not start until 1907 because of delays in the design. The extension opened on November 22, 1909 with Egleston as the sole new intermediate station; to the south was added as an infill station in 1912. =Architecture= The architectural design of the station was similar to the earlier stations designed by A.W. Longfellow Jr. at Dover and Northampton, with most exterior surfaces sheathed in copper, although it is not believed that Longfellow designed the station. Its structural design incorporated improvements over the older stations, including the first use of reinforced concrete on the Elevated. The waiting room was suspended below the steel elevated structure, which allowed it to be larger than the between-the-tracks waiting rooms at Dover and Northampton. Anticipating use of eight-car trains due to higher than expected ridership, the station was built with side platforms rather than a island platform. =Transfer station= 1916 plans for the transfer station Egleston was intended to serve as a transfer point for surface streetcar lines from Jamaica Plain and Dorchester in order to divert traffic from overcrowded Dudley station. The staircases from the station waiting room originally led directly into Egleston Square itself (on the northwest side of Washington Street between Columbus Avenue and Atherton Street) and into the median of Washington Street, which required many streetcar passengers to cross lanes of traffic to reach the station. In response to continued streetcar crowding at Dudley, the BERy built an off-street prepayment transfer station on the east side of the intersection, with an escalator and connecting bridge directly to the waiting room. The transfer station and bridge were constructed in 1916 and opened on January 20, 1918. =Closure= Streetcar transfer area at Egleston shortly before bustitution Streetcar service continued for several decades before bustitution; route 42 to Dudley was converted in September 1949, route 29 to Mattapan in September 1955, and route 40 to Arborway in December 1955. Route 43 ‚Äì the last streetcar route into the Tremont Street subway via the Pleasant Street incline ‚Äì was cut back from Egleston to Lenox Street in June 1956, although bustitution of the remaining section did not occur until 1961 and 1962. From 1979 to 1987, the Southwest Corridor was reconstructed to include the Orange Line as well as commuter rail and intercity service. Egleston station and the rest of the Washington Street Elevated closed on April 30, 1987; the relocated Orange Line opened on May 4, 1987.

It is frequently used in the industry areas such as muffler manufacturers and NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) department of automobile manufacturers. Generally the higher transmission loss of a system it has, the better it will perform in terms of noise cancellation.  Introduction  Transmission loss (TL) (more specifically in duct acoustics) is defined as the difference between the power incident on a duct acoustic device (muffler) and that transmitted downstream into an anechoic termination. Transmission loss is independent of the source and presumes (or requires) an anechoic termination at the downstream end. Transmission loss does not involve the source impedance and the radiation impedance inasmuch as it represents the difference between incident acoustic energy and that transmitted into an anechoic environment. Being made independent of the terminations, TL finds favor with researchers who are sometimes interested in finding the acoustic transmission behavior of an element or a set of elements in isolation of the terminations. But measurement of the incident wave in a standing wave acoustic field requires uses of impedance tube technology, may be quite laborious, unless one makes use of the two-microphone method with modern instrumentation.  Mathematical definition  Transmission loss (duct acoustics) definition illustration. By definition the TL on an acoustic component, for example a muffler, is described as: : TL = L_{Wi} - L_{Wo} = 10 \\\\log_{10} \\\\left\\\\vert {S_i p_{i+} v_{i+} \\\\over 2} {2\\\\over S_o p_o v_0 }\\\\right\\\\vert = 10 \\\\log_{10} \\\\left\\\\vert {S_i p_{i+}^2 \\\\over S_o p_o^2 }\\\\right\\\\vert where: *L_{Wi} is the incident sound power in the inlet coming towards muffler; *L_{Wo} is the transmitted sound power going downstream in the outlet out of the muffler; *S_i, S_o stand for the cross- sectional area of the inlet and outlet of muffler; *p_{i+} is the acoustic pressure of the incident wave in the inlet, towards muffler; *p_o is the acoustic pressure of the transmitted wave in the outlet, away from muffler. *v_{i+} is the particle velocity of the incident wave in the inlet, towards muffler; *v_o is the particle velocity of the transmitted wave in the outlet, away from muffler. Note that p_{i+} cannot be measured directly in isolation from the reflected wave pressure p_{i-} (in the inlet, away from muffler). One has to resort to impedance tube technology or two-microphone method with modern instrumentation. However at the downstream side of the muffler, p_o = p_{o+} in view of the anechoic termination, which ensures p_{o-} = 0. And in most muffler applications, Si and So, the area of the exhaust pipe and tail pipe, are generally made equal, thus we have: : TL = 20 \\\\log_{10} \\\\left\\\\vert {p_{i+} \\\\over p_o}\\\\right\\\\vert Thus, TL equals 20 times the logarithm (to the base 10) of the ratio of the acoustic pressure associated with the incident wave (in the exhaust pipe) and that of the transmitted wave (in the tail pipe), with the two pipes having the same cross-sectional area and the tail pipe terminating anechoically. However this anechoic condition is normally difficult to meet under practical industry environment, thus it is usually more convenient for the muffler manufacturers to measure insertions loss during their muffler performance tests under working conditions (mounted on an engine). Also, since the transmitted sound power cannot possibly exceed the incident sound power (or \\\\left\\\\vert p_{i+}\\\\right\\\\vert is always larger than \\\\left\\\\vert p_{o}\\\\right\\\\vert), it is known that TL will never be less than 0 dB.  Transmission matrix description  Transmission loss (duct acoustics) definition illustration with transmission matrix. The low-frequency approximation implies that each subsystem is an acoustic two-port (or four- pole system) with two (and only two) unknown parameters, the complex amplitudes of two interfering waves travelling in opposite directions. Such a system can be described by its transmission matrix (or four-pole matrix), as follows : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\hat p_i \\\\ \\\\hat q_i \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\hat p_o \\\\ \\\\hat q_o \\\\end{bmatrix} , where \\\\hat p_i,\\\\hat p_o,\\\\hat q_i and \\\\hat q_o are the sound pressures and volume velocities at the input and at the output. A, B, C and D are complex numbers. With this representation it can be prove that the transmission loss (TL) of this subsystem can be calculated as, : TL = 10 \\\\log_{10}\\\\left( {{1 \\\\over 4} \\\\left\\\\vert { A + B {S \\\\over \\\\rho c} + C { \\\\rho c \\\\over S} + D }\\\\right\\\\vert^2}\\\\right ), where: *S is inlet and outlet cross- sectional area; *\\\\rho c are media density and sound velocity.  A simple example  Transmission loss (duct acoustics) calculation - a simple example (one chamber silencer). Result of transmission loss (duct acoustics) calculation - a simple example (one chamber silencer). c=520m/s at 400¬∞C; l=0.5m; h=1/3. Considering we have the most simplest reactive silencer with only one expansion chamber (length l and cross-sectional area S2), with inlet and outlet both having cross-sectional area S1). As we know the transmission matrix of a tube (in this case, the expansion chamber) is : \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} {\\\\cos kl} & {j {\\\\rho c \\\\over S_2} \\\\sin kl}\\\\ {j {S_2\\\\over \\\\rho c} \\\\sin kl} & {\\\\cos kl} \\\\end{bmatrix} . Substitute to the equation of TL above, it can be seen that the TL of this simple reactive silencer is : \\\\begin{align} TL & = 10 \\\\log_{10}\\\\left ( {{1 \\\\over 4} \\\\left\\\\vert { {\\\\cos kl} + {j {S_1 \\\\over S_2} \\\\sin kl} + {j {S_2\\\\over S_1} \\\\sin kl} + {\\\\cos kl} }\\\\right\\\\vert^2} \\\\right ) \\\\ & = 10 \\\\log_{10}\\\\left ({{\\\\cos^2 kl} +{1 \\\\over 4} \\\\left (h + {1 \\\\over h}\\\\right )^2 {\\\\sin^2 kl}}\\\\right ) \\\\ & = 10 \\\\log_{10}\\\\left ({1 +{1 \\\\over 4} \\\\left (h - {1 \\\\over h}\\\\right )^2 {\\\\sin^2 kl}}\\\\right ), \\\\end{align} where h is the ratio of the cross-sectional areas and l is the length of the chamber. k=\\\\omega / c is the wave number while c is the sound speed. Note that the transmission loss is zero when l is a multiple of half a wavelength. As a simple example, consider a one chamber silencer with h=S1/S2=1/3, at around 400 ¬∞C the sound speed is about 520 m/s, with l=0.5 m, one easily calculate the TL result shown on the plot on the right. Note that the TL equals zero when frequency is a multiple of c \\\\over {2 l} and TL peaks when frequency is {c \\\\over {4 l}} + {n * {c \\\\over {2 l}}}. Also note that the above calculation is only valid for low-frequency range because at low-frequency range the sound wave can be treated as a plane wave. The TL calculation will start losing its accuracy when the frequency goes above the cutoff frequency, which can be calculated as f_c = 1.84 {c \\\\over {\\\\pi D}}, where D is diameter of the largest pipe in the structure. In the case above, if for example the muffler body has a diameter of 300mm, then the cut-off frequency is then 1.84*520/pi/0.3=1015 Hz.

Sharpe would back up her podium pedigree with a gold medal win on the 2014‚Äì15 FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup to end the season. She also placed second in the Breckenridge Dew Tour in 2015. She would make her X Games debut in January 2016 where she placed fourth. Unknowingly she was competing with a stress fracture in her back that occurred in December 2015 but was only diagnosed by an MRI scan after the X Games. Wearing a back brace Sharpe would win gold at Winter X Games Oslo in 2016. She would follow up her X Games Gold with a World Cup gold at the event in Tignes, France. While qualifying in Tignes, she broke her thumb after a fall. Sharpe would tape up her thumb and later in the event became the first woman to ever land a switch cork 720 in competition. She would later have surgery to reconnect the ligament and remove a bone fragment in her thumb. To start the 2017‚Äì18 World Cup season Sharpe won the halfpipe event at Cardrona, New Zealand. She would also win gold Snowmass, Colorado and gold on the Dew Tour. Sharpe would build on this success into the 2018 Winter Olympics, her first Olympic competition. Sharpe qualified first overall for the halfpipe final. There her first two runs both would have had her in first atop the podium, her third run was a victory lap. She credited her Olympic training to practicing everyday, saying of her frequent practices that it was \\"so much to the point that I'm like 'I don't want to anymore, I want to have fun.' But it is fun for me. My job is my favourite thing to do.\\" Sharpe concluded the World Cup season with a gold medal win in Tignes, which made her the Crystal Globe winner for the women's halfpipe season. She commented: \\"I'm really excited at how the year went. Every contest was a new challenge unto itself but I'm so stoked to finish the year as the overall winner.\\" Personal She is sister to snowboarder Douglas Sharpe and Darcy Sharpe. Sharpe now currently lives in Vancouver.

Rugby was introduced to the Dominican Republic in 1972 by Jean-Paul Bossuge, a French diplomat. The game began to grow, particularly within the universities, and by the 1970s the original Dominican Rugby Union had been formed with Dr. William Acosta appointed as the inaugural president. Dominican teams began competing in domestic and international tournaments and by the 1980s there were ten active clubs. However, rugby was not officially recognised by the Dominican Olympic Committee and funding for the game was low. Interest had waned by the early 1990s. Dominican Rugby was revived in 1997 with teams being sent to Trinidad and Tobago's rugby sevens tournament from 1997 to 2000. Recognising a need to retain and increase player numbers, Fedorugby was formed in 2004 to bring the Dominican rugby clubs and players together under one organising body.

Early life and career Born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel, Shiraz started her career in 1994 as a spokesperson and director of public relations at the Opera Tower residential and commercial center, completed that year by the Alrov Group. In 1997, Shiraz joined Spot Productions Ltd., the company producing Deadly Fortune (Kesef Katlani) - then a startup TV series, as VP of marketing and public relations. The series ended up being aired on prime time in Channel 2 during its first two seasons, and later on in Channel 3 (seasons 3 and 4), and topped the Israeli television rating. It included the actors Nathan Ravitz, Rafi Tavor, Aharon Ipale and Yossi Graber in the leading roles and was sold to broadcasting channels in Europe as well. Politics Shiraz went into politics in 2000 and was appointed head of communication at 'Gesher' political party and its non-profit organization. In November 2002, Shiraz was elected by the party's members as the head of the party, after David Levy, its founder and leader, moved back to the Likud. Shiraz led 'Gesher' in the elections for the 16th Israeli Parliament, the \\"Knesset\\", a move followed by a surprising political and legal battle in the years to come, with David Levy fighting to dismantle Gesher and relate to his move as a merge of his political party in its entirety with the Likud, and Shiraz and the rest of the party‚Äôs members aiming to leave the party intact and transform it into a modern social party, appealing to Israel's young academics and professionals. Following the Court's decision to instruct the Central Elections Committee to remove the Gesher Knesset list during the process, Shiraz was appointed director of operations and campaign advisor to Dr. Lea Nass-Arden - a politically unknown candidate at that point - and built the campaign on the concept of Nass being the only religious woman in the Likud primary elections for the 16th Knesset. The campaign brought Nass to be placed 36th in the Likud list of candidates, and when the Likud won 38 seats that year, Nass-Arden became a Knesset member, and later on was appointed Deputy Minister of Pensioner Affairs. Shiraz moved with her family to the US in 2003, and the process of legal motions and appeals by the party's members and David Levy, continued until 2007, with the court's decision that Gesher would cease to exist as a political party. Recent Shiraz moved with her family to Miami, FL in 2003, and founded Promise Lifestyle Magazine in order to offer an appealing publication to the Jewish American population. The publication featured profile articles and interviews with high profile business people, public figures and celebrities, such as Michael Douglas, Barbra Streisand, Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman. Regular contributors throughout the years included Uri Geller, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Bernie De Koven and Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon Toby Mayer. In 2005-2006, Shiraz was chair of Ft. Lauderdale-Haifa sister cities, and a member of the board of directors for the Greater Ft. Lauderdale Sister Cities International non-profit organization (GFLSCI), which goal is to develop municipal partnerships between U.S. cities and states and similar jurisdictions in other nations. In 2009, Shiraz established a communications and PR firm. She was named 'Woman of Excellence' by the National Association of Professional & Executive Women and has won various awards including the American Graphic Design Award, Benjamin Franklin Award and Florida Print Award. Personal life and current career Shiraz is a certified Florida Supreme Court mediator, and is focused in recent years on mediating high conflict cases and disputes, in addition to her long-lasting activity as a publisher, entrepreneur, linguist and communication expert. She has been known to bring tough civil, commercial and family disputes to a resolution, with an unusually high success rate, independently and at the Los Angeles Superior Court. She mediates divorce, civil harassment, domestic violence, small claims, and other conflicts as a panel mediator for the Center for Conflict Resolution (CCR) and the California Academy of Mediation Professionals (CAMP), and is a member of South California Mediators Association. She regularly trains and is observed by attorneys and MBA students of the internationally recognized Alternative Dispute Resolution programs at USC and the Pepperdine University Schools of Law. Shiraz is also the founder of a non-profit organization aimed to change the image of the State of Israel around the world. A double major in Special Education and Humanities, Shiraz earned her bachelor's degree from Tel Aviv University, where she graduated magna cum laude, and received her master's degree in Communications, Journalism and Political Science from Bar Ilan University. During those years, she experimented with modeling, working as a flight attendant and on board cruise ships, fulfilling her strong desire to be exposed to different countries, people and cultures. She resides in Los Angeles, CA.

As a result, both machines earned a reputation for being notoriously unreliable. In addition, the optional LinnSequencer SMPTE feature could not be deployed due to flawed circuit design. The last LinnSequencer operating system released by Linn Electronics was version 5.17. When Linn went out of business in 1986, Forat Electronics purchased Linn's remaining assets and completely revamped the Linn 9000 and LinnSequencer operating system. They fixed all the bugs and added some new features to the LinnSequencer. The Forat LinnSequencer was released in 1987 by Forat Electronics at a list price of $1,000 (including all fixes and upgrades). The Forat LinnSequencer was manufactured and sold as a new complete unit. Forat also offered software and hardware upgrades to existing LinnSequencers. Forat discontinued manufacturing new complete Forat LinnSequencers in 1994.

It was built around 1800 for Francis of Lasocki and likely designed by Hilary Szpilowski, who created many classicist palaces in the Mazovia region. The Tu≈Çowice Mansion is one of the region's most beautiful landowners' residences. It exhibits harmony of form, architectural beauty and atmosphere.  History  The Tu≈Çowice manor house was built around 1800 for Francis from Lasocki's family. Over the years, owners changed often. Linowski Constantine was in possession from 1822 to 1833. It then became the property of Orsetich until 1857. Mountain, then Marcel Divine, Hilary Ostrowski, from 1871 to the early twentieth century Bolechowskich was in possession, and in the interwar it went to Domaszowskich. Today, along with the park, it is owned by a private person, painter Andrzej Nov√°k-Zempli≈Ñski. The owners have respected the style in which the mansion was maintained and in the 80s built an outbuilding which also maintained a similar neoclassical spirit, also then in the park neo-Gothic chapel stood there. Tu≈Çowice emphasizes an authentic collection of carriages, which is in the possession of the owner. This makes the mansion popular among fans of carriages and horse-drawn vehicles. It is the only collection in Poland, and the owner has 24 vehicles, most of the documented provenance. They are kept in a specially adapted, stylish carriage house, the former court stables.Piotr Libicki, Marcin Libicki: ‚ÄûDwory i pa≈Çace wiejskie na mazowszu‚Äù: Wydawnictwo REBIS, 2009.  Building  The mansion is a ground-floor building with a higher central part of the house. It is preceded by a four column Tuscan portico crowned with a triangular pediment. The portico was placed in the garden elevation rather than the front elevation. This change of the front elevation and opening the living room for the view of the park is an expression of a new era of the Enlightenment. This palace stands in opposition to the elegant Baroque palaces and endless courtyard garden. This is a quiet and intimate setting directed to the residents house where nature plays a very important role. This is a reference to the era of romanticism, which laid emphasis on the role of dreams and nature. From the front, the mansion is decorated with a modest break with a pair of Tuscan pilasters and triangular pediments.

Background This was the first studio album on Smash to feature new material by Lewis, with the pianist having recorded remakes of his Sun hits for Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis the year before. Lewis had not enjoyed much chart success since becoming an industry pariah after the news of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin Myra came to light in 1958, but he retained a loyal fan base in Europe, which showed great enthusiasm for his wild shows. Lewis had also recorded Live at the Star Club, Hamburg in 1964, an album that many consider one of the wildest performances ever. Lewis had been touring non-stop since the scandal and his ability to play ferocious rock and roll had remained undiminished in the face of dwindling sales. Hoping to recapture his past success, Lewis and producer Shelby Singleton began work on a new rock and roll album. In the liner notes, Robert Tubert wrote: \\"Rock is the music which vibrantly records the time in which we live ... and Jerry Lee Lewis is one of its greatest exponents.\\" Rock is \\"the voice of the young\\". Jerry Lee Lewis was one of the founders of the new musical idiom in the 1950s. He should be listened to by the 1960s generation because he is \\"telling it like it is.\\" It was a sales pitch to the new generation by a legendary musician present at the creation of Rock and Roll. The single released from the album was \\"Baby, Hold Me Close\\" backed by \\"I Believe in You\\".Smash Records. 7\\" Singles/EP collection.Jerry Lee Lewis - Baby, Hold Me Close. Discogs.com. Recording The album featured \\"Baby, Hold Me Close\\", a song composed by Jerry Lee Lewis and Bob Tubert. \\"Baby, Hold Me Close\\" was the song released as the A side 45 single from the album with \\"I Believe in You\\" as the B side. This was the only single from the album. The single reached no. 129 on the Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100 Chart. Jerry Lee Lewis performed the song live on the musical variety TV series Shindig! in 1965.Shindig! Season 1. Episode 24. February 17, 1965. IMDB. The album includes three Chuck Berry songs, \\"Maybellene,\\" \\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" and \\"Johnny B. Goode.\\" Although the two rock and roll icons had been rivals in the past, they did have a mutual respect for one another and Lewis would return again and again to Berry compositions throughout his career. (In the 1987 documentary Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll!, Lewis states, \\"He's the King of rock and roll. Even my mama said that.\\") Lewis also performs Big Joe Turner's \\"Flip, Flop and Fly\\" and the old blues \\"Corrine, Corrina\\" in his patented boogie-woogie style. His reading of Hank Ballard's \\"Sexy Ways\\" was particularly racy for the time, containing lines like, \\"Come on darlin', now, I want you to get on your knees one time and shake for Jerry Lee Lewis, honey - yeah!\\" Reception The album was released on June 4, 1965, and cracked the Top 200 but stalled at number 121, lacking the breakout song for a comeback. In 2014 Lewis biographer Rick Bragg observed, \\"The problem, as always, was material, not technique.\\" In his 2009 book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, Joe Bonomo, while praising \\"Baby, Hold Me CLose\\", \\"Maybellene\\" and \\"Sexy Ways\\", notes that the album came out \\"as Barbra Streisand, Herman's Hermits, the Supremes, and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass were chumming it up on the Billboard album chart. The bespangled commercial ceiling was dropping fast.\\" The perception that Lewis was out of step with the times was not helped by the album cover, which Bonomo derides: \\"The Return of Rock is nearly done in before the needle drops by an atrocious cover: decked out in a mummified paisley tux and frilly shirt, smiling wanly, Jerry Lee looks like Liberace's sickly younger brother, while a few teenagers dance in mild bewilderment as if they'd been teleported from the set of Shindig!\\" Bonomo, however, characterized the self-penned single from the album \\"Baby, Hold Me Close\\" as \\"a cool studio-concocted groove\\".Bonomo, Joe.

Already established as a social critic of American society and the role of its youth in his previous book Growing Up Absurd (1960), Goodman argues in Compulsory Miseducation against the necessity of schools for the socialization of youth and recommends their abolition. He suggests that formal education lasts too long, teaches the wrong social class values, and increasingly damages students over time. Goodman writes that the school reflects the misguided and insincere values of its society and thus school reformers should focus on these values before schools. He proposes a variety of alternatives to school including no school, the city or farm as school, apprenticeships, guided travel, and youth organizations. Reviewers complimented Goodman's style and noted his deliberate contrarianism, but were split on the feasibility of his proposals. Goodman's book was a precursor to the work of deschooling advocate Ivan Illich.  Background  Paul Goodman was an American intellectual and cultural critic who rose to prominence after publishing Growing Up Absurd (1960). In the book, Goodman asserts that the structure of American society was not conducive to the needs of youth. Goodman's subsequent book, The Community of Scholars (1962), and his experience in the classroom, informed his criticism of American schooling and the development of Compulsory Miseducation. The book was initially published in 1964 by Horizon Press, and was later republished by Random House in 1966 and by Penguin Books in 1971.  Summary  Compulsory Miseducation is a critique of the American public school system. Goodman argues against its social necessity and mandatory attendance requirements. He contends that the only \\"right education\\" is \\"growing up into a worthwhile world\\", and that adult concern over schooling is indicative of an opposite such world. Goodman thinks education should strengthen children's preexisting drive towards refining their own abilities for usefulness in society while developing community spirit. He claims that school, of which there is too much, instead encourages conformity for the good of private, corporate needs at a cost to the public. Goodman writes that America's schools reflect its misguided and insincere societal values, which need to change before schools can. Goodman criticizes the structure of academic curriculum, and connects it with \\"programmed instruction\\" and schooling that emaciates the mind proportional with time. He regards the \\"academic establishment\\" as self- aggrandizing and constituting \\"an invested intellectual class worse than anything since the time of Henry the Eighth.\\" Accordingly, the scholastically inclined, knowing only lockstep, march unquestioningly into \\"top management and expert adviser\\" roles while the rest have little self-worth in their societal roles, pursuing \\"worthless\\" degrees that make their schooling appear as \\"a cruel hoax\\". Goodman sees schools as mechanisms for adjusting youth to an automated society increasingly absent \\"any human values\\". Goodman disagrees with those who say public schools teach middle class values, as he sees schools as more petit bourgeois than bourgeois, favoring \\"bureaucratic, time- serving, grade-grind-practical, timid, and nouveau riche climbing\\" over \\"independence, initiative, scrupulous honesty, earnestness, utility, [and] respect for thorough scholarship\\". In this way, schooling is not a good use of student time, and students are right to quit and avoid the psychological and professional damage. More important is the disintegration of social class segregation. Goodman then asserts that lower- and middle-class kids would be better off without public or any schooling altogether. He proposes several alternatives to formal schooling, such as divvying up the high school's public funds directly amongst its students, and advocates for a variety of experimental school alternatives: \\"no school at all, the real city as school, farm schools, practical apprenticeships, guided travel, work camps, little theaters and local newspapers, [and] community service\\". Other proposals include making class non-compulsory (such that attendance will reflect student interest without \\"trapping\\" children), requiring students to wait two years before applying to the most elite colleges, eliminating grades so the burden of testing for required skills falls on companies, and letting students quit and resume freely. He proposes Danish folk school-style education for those uninterested in academics. Goodman's foremost intention was to stimulate new educational paradigms. He acknowledges that his specific proposals may be unpopular or ignored.  Reception  John Keats (The New York Times Book Review) described Compulsory Miseducation as \\"passionate\\" and \\"eloquent\\". He called Goodman's propositions in the absence of formal schooling \\"startling\\" and characterized Goodman as \\"a lonely humanist crying in a Philistine marketplace, where the largest single share of public wealth is devoted to the strategies of overkill, and where another enormous amount is dedicated to putting blinders on the probable victims.\\" Keats recommended the book for parents who put their children's welfare before their own. Eli M. Oboler (Library Journal), meanwhile, only recommended Goodman's \\"polemic onslaught\\" for those who like \\"contentious [and] disagreeable\\" material. He wrote that Goodman's approach was unreasonable and contrarian: for instance, his stances in favor of sexual expression and against the importance of literacy in schools. Edgar Z. Friedenberg (The New York Review of Books) explained the book as a poem by Marianne Moore's definition: \\"an imaginary garden with real toads in it\\". By this metaphor, he found Goodman to be a gardener who lacked imagination and forethought but understood growth (the most important trait). Friedenberg compared Goodman with prominent educationist James Conant, whom Friedenberg considered less competent in understanding the conditions of learning. Friedenberg felt that Conant's Shaping Educational Policy complemented Goodman's Compulsory Miseducation, as both shared a common though disparate interest in the distribution of power within schooling structures. While Friedenberg agreed with Goodman's conclusions, he considered them sermon-like in their predetermination, permitting no counter-interpretation. He added that Goodman's \\"empirical inductive and ... theoretical-deductive\\" logic was complete and that the work provided little apart from a neat interpretation of the reality within schools and its effect on students' human attributes. Friedenberg wrote that Goodman's proposals are \\"pertinent, concrete, modest, and inexpensive\\", practical in their aims, and already implemented on a smaller scale. Furthermore, he concluded that Goodman's argument on how education squandered what it intended to promote was \\"strong [and] circumstantial\\". Nat Hentoff (The Reporter) struggled to disagree with Goodman's claim that schools provided little room for \\"spontaneity\\" and free spiritedness. However, he felt that Goodman inadequately explained how primary schools could be improved in content and staffing. Hentoff said that the book's key flaw was its position in a \\"political vacuum\\", offering no means for society to acknowledge Goodman's expressed unviability of their schooling model. Donald Barr (New York Herald Tribune Book Week) wrote that Goodman seemed like \\"an itinerant peddler of sedition\\" who spoke of virtuous \\"dissonance\\". Barr considered Goodman \\"extraordinarily sensitive to children and adolescents\\" and complimented his \\"brilliant authenticity\\" when describing how children learn \\"defiance and embarrassment\\". However, Barr found Goodman's \\"purblind resentment of all authority\\" to obstruct his points and to leave his readers skeptical. Children, Barr wrote, are lost if they cannot find the limits they serve to test, and \\"partisan\\" Goodman was unable to parse the wickedness of continually \\"yielding, ... tolerating, understanding\\" children who must feel resistance against their transgressions to develop the respect they seek.  Legacy  The book influenced the free school movement of the late 1960s. Nigel Melville (Fortnight) placed Goodman alongside Herb Kohl, Neil Postman, Jules Henry, and Everett Reimer as part of an education anti- orthodoxy, or new orthodoxy under Ivan Illich and Paulo Freire. Bill Prescott (Instructional Science) said the book was \\"among the most influential\\" in education circles in the early 1970s. He wrote that Goodman pioneered advocation for deschooling and the disestablishment of schools, which was later popularized by Illich and Reimer (though Goodman's thoughts were less articulate in comparison). In a 2006 retrospective of Goodman's work for Teachers College Record, James S. Kaminsky said that Goodman's four book- length critiques of American education together made Goodman a prominent intellectual and educationist.

At this time, Kathy meets Timothy (Huang Lei), a waiter on the ship, who came from a same background as her. Kathy feels unrestrained while being with Timothy, and thus, her heart starts to shift. However, Albert is unwilling to give up and he is confident that he will be able to win Kathy back with his charm. At this time, Sandy (Hikari Ishida) appears around Timothy and she views Albert as an enemy. Compared to Albert, Sandy is far more acerbic and a much bigger spender. However, Albert gradually discovers that while Sandy is not bickering with him, he feels empty and lonely, a feeling that he has never had. Before, nobody had dared to point out Albert's shortcomings, only Sandy dared to point them out publicly. As he comes in contact with Sandy more, he becomes attracted to her personality. While the ship is to dock and Albert wants to express his feelings, he discovers police officers on shore waiting for Sandy. It turns out that Sandy is bankrupt and this will be her last journey. Whether or not Kathy and Timothy can be together, or whether Albert is able to reverse the adverse and win Sandy's heart, there will always be an end on a wandering life on a ship when it goes to shore.

He stated that while he was paid over HK$10 million, when he went aboard the cruise ship to film at the Caribbean Sea, after the film company paid him his salary, they did not have any money to hire crew members and extra actors, and thus, Lau was very busy on set having to take care of other crew work. Speaking of how he felt cheated when he got on board, Lau stated, On set, Lau had to pave the rails for the cameras to move and worked as set coordinator and inviting cruise passengers to work as extras. Reception =Critical= Love HK Film gave the film a negative review: \\"Designed solely to make money during the Lunar New Year, this fluffy romantic comedy rests solely on Lau‚Äôs able shoulders. Sadly, the filmmakers didn‚Äôt give him a proper character.\\" =Box office= The film grossed HK $8,889,770 at the Hong Kong box office during its theatrical run from 13 February to 19 March 1999 in Hong Kong.

EFPSA currently consists of 33 Member Organisations and two Observer Organisations, each represented by a Member Representative, who collectively form the legislative body of the Federation The work of the Federation is perpetuated through the work of the Member Representatives (MRs), the Executive Board (EB) and the Board of Management (BM). EFPSA provides psychology students with diverse opportunities for scientific- and self-development through its Events and Services. Additionally, EFPSA also aims to contribute to a positive impact in society through a variety of campaigns while representing the interest and needs of psychology students on a European level. History EFPSA was founded in April 1987 at the University of Lisbon, Portugal where European psychology students from all over Europe had been invited to a meeting. Psychology students from eight European countries formed the European Federation of Psychology Students‚Äô Associations (EFPSA). The basic outlines of this Federation were transformed into formal statutes during the second meeting in Liege, Belgium in April 1988. At the same time, EFPSA initiated its first project, the EUROPSYCHO-Database on education and exchange. In January 1989, EFPSA was registered as an international association according to the Belgian law. During the third General Assembly in April 1989 in Lund, Sweden, the Federation developed its initial structure with the first meeting of the Executive Board (EB) being held for the first time in that same year. In July 1991, EFPSA started a collaboration with the European Federation of Psychologists' Associations (EFPA) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, after which EFPSA became an official affiliate member of EFPA in 2001. After EFPSA's participation in the first European Student Conference (which brought together about 500 students from a number of disciplines) in Liege (Belgium) in November 1990, a lot of new contacts were made, especially with Eastern European countries. During the fifth General Assembly in April 1991 in Geneva (Switzerland) EFPSA grew to 11 member countries, and the first delegation from Eastern Europe was welcomed. In this year the idea of permanent working groups (called \\"task forces\\") came into being to enable more efficient work on projects such as EUROPSYCHO, ERASMUS, etc. Over the years leading up to new millennium, more Events in the form of Summer Schools and seminars and, of course, the Congress were organised under the guidance of EFPSA. In 2006, EFPSA developed its Corporate Visual Identity and became recognised with its representative logo and orange colour. Mission, Values and Vision = Mission = EFPSA's mission is to bring psychology students together on a European level to enrich their concept and application of psychology and encourage skill development in order to contribute to the improvement of the field; have a positive impact on society and its perception of psychology; support scientific and social interaction and cultural exchange between psychology students, academics and professionals. This is implemented by consistently developing services, Events and the quality of interaction between European psychology students and their national, regional and local associations, and creating an encouraging environment for psychology as a professional and scientific field in Europe. = Vision = EFPSA's vision is to have a psychologically aware society where the misconceptions that surround it are diminished in order to enhance general wellbeing; to provide services and events that accommodate the vast expanse of needs of psychology students to develop themselves professionally and reach interconnectedness across all of Europe. = Values = Association: As an organisation, to be connected both internally and externally, within the EFPSA working community and with organisations who share a similar mission and values. Clarity: To have an integral, coherent and consistent approach to all aspects of our operations. Diversity: To accept the differences; to respect and welcome them as valuable assets. Fortitude: To have courage in adversity and unforeseen circumstances.  Structure  The structure of EFPSA was developed at the third General Assembly in April 1989 in Lund (Sweden). At this time, members of the Executive Board also covered the functions that Member Representatives do now. There were no Board of Management positions, only a President. Since then, EFPSA has grown in size and had to implement some significant structural changes, creating a new form of Executive Board. In 2003, the concept of National Representatives (nowadays known as Member Representatives) was introduced. These formed the new decision-making body from each of the associations which were members of EFPSA. Furthermore, the Board of Management as a separate body within the Executive Board was formed due to the need for leadership on strategic decisions, as well as monitoring the efficiency of the whole organisation. Events EFPSA currently organises eleven annual and one biennial event: The Congress, European Summer School (ESS), EFPSA Academy, Train the Trainers (TtT) Summer School, Train Advanced Trainers (TAT), Trainers‚Äô Meeting (TRAM), Trainers‚Äô Conference (TRaC), EFPSA Day, the Joint Executive Board & Member Representatives Meeting and Board of Management Meetings are the annual events, while the Conference is the biennial event. = The annual EFPSA Congress = The annual EFPSA Congress is a weeklong Event which gathers over 350 psychology students, academics and researchers from across Europe. The Congress, which typically takes place between the months of April and May, is composed of a diverse scientific programme exploring a specific theme every year with contributions from students, researchers and experienced academics, and a social programme which provides participants with the opportunity for cultural and social exchange. Thus the EFPSA Congress is a unique opportunity for psychology students to broaden their scientific and personal horizons. Additionally, the Congress is a very important event for the Federation as this event marks the start of the new mandate for the Member Representatives and Executive Board. The Executive Board and Board of Management are chosen at the EFPSA Congress, after which they immediately assume their duties and begin to develop their projects during their week at the Congress. Each year, the host country of the EFPSA Congress changes. There have been 32 Congresses to date, which have been organised in 25 different countries. The 33rd EFPSA Congress will be taking place in 2019 in Denmark. = European Summer School = The first European Summer School (ESS) took place in Leie, Estonia in 2007. with the topic ‚ÄòCross-Cultural Psychology‚Äô followed by European Summer Schools covering different topics each subsequent year. During this seven-day event students immerse themselves into a programme of intercultural research where they have the opportunity to join one of six research projects led by a PhD supervisor in planning and implementing a 12-month study. Apart from this, the programme is enriched by a variety of lectures given by professionals from relevant areas of psychology. Each year, all lectures and research are set against a theme, chosen to reflect a field of contemporary psychology. Since 2011, all ESS participants completing the training programme and committing to the research project have been invited to join the Junior Researcher Programme, extending the European Summer School from a one-week Event into a fully structured 12-month research programme. = EFPSA Day = EFPSA Day is a promotional event that takes place across Europe at the beginning of December. The first EFPSA Day was held in 2010. The aim of this one-day event is to spread the word about EFPSA all over Europe. Presentations, workshops and other activities connected with EFPSA take place in many universities on the same day in order to make as many students as possible familiar with EFPSA. = Train the Trainers = In 2010, the first Train the Trainers summer school took place in Austria. The Train the Trainers (TtT) summer school is an annual seven-day event featuring experiential and non-formal education aimed at providing its twelve participants with insights and tutoring on a broad set of skills and knowledge about delivering training and information. Upon completion of set requirements, the TtT graduates may be invited to join the EFPSA Trainers‚Äô Pool ‚Äì a supportive environment for furthering training skills and experiences. = Train Advanced Trainers = EFPSA's Train Advanced Trainers (TAT) is an eight-day event that takes place in March. This is the only EFPSA event that is open to non-psychology students and externals. The TAT is designed for up to 25 experienced trainers from various NGOs and offers an opportunity to further develop training skills within a specific topic. =EFPSA Academy= The EFPSA Academy aims to bring together volunteers of European youth NGOs to enable them to develop professionally, establish networks, heighten their motivation and share experiences, while equipping them with a variety of skills and knowledge concerning a specified core topic. It lasts three days, in a city that is quick and easy to reach from many places. During the Academy, participants receive high quality training sessions, get the chance to attend workshops given by experts on the topic and will be able to practice their skills in hands-on examples and real-life challenges. =Trainers' meeting= EFPSA Trainers‚Äô Meeting (typically abbreviated as TRAM) is a three to four-day low budget Event aimed at trainers‚Äô education, organised by EFPSA Trainers. The goal of TRAM is for NGO/youth trainers to unite, share knowledge and experience and develop their skills. The Event is centered around a main topic related to training, which is delivered by an expert trainer. Participants are trainers from different organisations and they deliver trainings to each other on topics related to the main theme of the Event. =Trainers' Conference= EFPSA Trainers‚Äô Conference (typically abbreviated as TraC) is an Event aimed to gather EFPSA Trainers in order to discuss several topics regarding the training world within EFPSA and in general. The number of participants, the duration and the timing of the Event is flexible and it can change every mandate. Generally, there is an Open Training Day where TraC participants have the opportunity to deliver trainings in the nearest university. = Joint Executive Board & Member Representatives Meeting = The annual Joint Executive Board & Member Representatives‚Äô Meeting (Joint EB & MR Meeting) is held each autumn and it is attended by individuals who are active members within the EFPSA working community. This meeting is a unique occasion when EFPSA sets aside online communication as it convenes for a week of internal meetings and intense work. Taking place halfway through the EFPSA mandate, the Joint EB & MR Meeting is a crucial time for EFPSA, allowing all active students of EFPSA to gather in order to discuss their mandate so far and engage in discussion with other teams over the future direction of the Federation. = EFPSA Conference = The EFPSA Conference first took place in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in 2013. The EFPSA Conference is a biennial event and places a particular emphasis on its scientific programme. It brings together around 150 students from all over Europe for four days of lectures, workshops and student presentations. During the Conference, there is an open day, which consists of approximately 30 students from the hosting country/region joining the Conference for one day, to get an opportunity to learn, partake in the lectures and network with the participants. =Board of Management Meeting I&II;= The Board of Management Meeting(s) is a fundamental component in terms of EFPSA's administration and working practices in order to evaluate the work of the Federation, develop ideas in order to facilitate this work and contribute to the improvement and sustainability of EFPSA. The place of the Event(s) is decided every year from the Board of Management. The working programme involves analysis of the Federation, plenary sessions of EFPSA, its Mission, Vision, Values and Events and Services, project based work and discussion sessions. Services EFPSA also provides students with a variety of services for developing research and training skills and to facilitate the process of travelling and studying abroad. Among the EFPSA services are: * Journal of European Psychology Students * Junior Research Programme * Study & Travel Abroad * Training Office * Social Impact Initiative =Journal of European Psychology Students= The Journal of European Psychology Students (JEPS) is a double-blind peer-reviewed open access academic journal run entirely by students, covering all aspects of psychology published by the EFPSA and Ubiquity Press since 2009. JEPS brings a legitimate opportunity for psychology students to consider their thesis or research with international scope. Submissions have to be based on research conducted by bachelor or master students who may also be from outside Europe. Authors of selected submissions will receive professional feedback and help in developing their scientific publication. Articles are selected based on quality of research alone, disregarding the perceived importance and originality of a particular paper. Articles are indexed in EBSCOHost. Since 2016, JEPS invites students to submit Registered Reports. The JEPS team also run a blog, the JEPS Bulletin, which has been publishing since November 2010 on a range of issues relevant to psychology students of all levels and varied fields of interest. = Study & Travel Abroad = Study Abroad considers its existence, at least, since the early ‚Äò90s where it began as a project under the name ‚ÄúHow to Study Abroad‚Äù and later on as \\"Study and Work Abroad\\" (SWA). Since 2005 the Service has focused on ‚ÄúStudy Abroad‚Äù (SA) and can now be found through the main website where information, advice and experience stories can be found. As of 2015, the Travel Network and the Study Abroad Services have been merged into the Study & Travel Abroad Service, which continues much with the same visions, missions and values as the predecessors. In 2016, the Student Exchange Responsible became part of the team, opening up the opportunity for Member Organisations to receive support from EFPSA in organising their international exchanges with other psychology student associations and students from other healthcare disciplines. The Internship Task Force was launched in the mandate 2015-2016 and extended for the mandate 2016-2017 in order to build a strategy, working towards the development of an internship platform for EFPSA. The team set forth a number of goals for the Internship Task Force. These were to outline the internship possibilities students are looking for, set-up a database with contacts of possible partnerships that could provide internship opportunities, make initial contact with the collected contacts in order to establish these partnerships, and build a solid foundation for the following mandate. The work has now been passed on to the Internship Responsible, within the Study & Travel Abroad Service, following approval of the position during the General Assembly held at the 31st EFPSA Congress in Gakh, Azerbaijan in 2017. The first internship opportunity was offered to psychology students in August 2017. Preparations for studying abroad can sometimes be a challenging experience, but EFPSA's Study and Travel Abroad service offers useful guidelines and information about all the cities and universities of EFPSA's member countries/regions with the possibility to study psychology. There is also information on each country's higher education system, tuition and living costs, amongst other information. Additionally, there is a couch-surfing network that also provides advice on travelling to countries/regions hosting EFPSA events. While offering students a place to sleep at your home, all around Europe students will welcome you to stay with them and discover their cities. This is an opportunity to experience different cultures, languages and food in a special and affordable way. = Training Office = The Training Office was introduced to the Federation in 2010 with the first Train the Trainers summer school taking place in Austria in August 2010. At the 2011 Congress, this first generation of trainers was already delivering sessions to the Member Representatives and the Executive Board. The Training Office manages the training agenda within EFPSA. Specifically, they oversee the programmes of the training Events which EFPSA hosts, namely the Train the Trainers (TtT) summer school and Train Advanced Trainers (TAT) school; support and foster the development of the group of trainers in the EFPSA Trainers‚Äô Pool, represent EFPSA at the external training events and prepare and design training sessions for internal meetings of EFPSA such as team building sessions, leadership trainings, amongst others. = Social Impact Initiative = The Social Impact Initiative Team works on four main projects within the Federation: the \\"Mind the Mind - to Combat the Stigma of Mental Disorders\\" (MtM) campaign, the ‚ÄúBetter Together‚Äù (BT) campaign and Organised acts of kindness (OAK) campaign. Within the MtM campaign, the members of the team facilitate a European-wide series of workshops, aimed at 11-18 year-old students, as well as adults, with a goal of raising awareness on the topics of stigma of mental disorder and mental health. The campaign will enter its fifth wave in autumn 2018. The first four waves were marked by a significant growth in the number of volunteers and countries, with over 1150 volunteers from 20 European countries taking part in the fourth wave of the campaign. The BT campaign is aimed at empowering youths to build more inclusive societies through a series of 5 workshops aimed at increasing their knowledge about discrimination and the downsides to it. Members of the team facilitate the implementation of workshops. The campaign has received a grant from the European Youth Foundation and it will enter its second wave in autumn 2018. The OAK campaign is aimed at incentivizing people to do ‚Äúrandom acts of kindness‚Äù (e.g. buying coffee for a stranger), which would help them develop a habit of kind behavior. A smartphone app through which the campaign would be implemented is expected to launch in early 2019. Member Organisations Organisations from all countries recognised by the Council of Europe can become members of EFPSA. Organisations from countries/regions that are not recognised by the Council of Europe can be taken into consideration as Regional Members. As of April 2018, EFPSA has 33 Member Organisations and two Observer Organisations.

History When Count Felice Gazola or Gazzola, Lieutenant General of the Spanish Army, Commander and Coronel of artillery, and Commendatore of the Order of Calatrava died in 1780, his will left money to native Piacenza to: maintain and dress six youths working in decorative or figure painting, wood or marble sculpture, architecture, surveying, art of jewel making... and if Piacenza lacked persons able to teach painting, sculpture, and architecture, the youths would be sent to either Parma or Bologna.Nuovissima guida della citt√† di Piacenza con alquanti cenni topografici, statistici, e storici, by Tipografia Domenico Tagliaferri, Piazza de' Cavalli, #55, Piacenza (1842); Page 217. He named as administrators of this institute the heads of eight prominent local families: another Conti Gazola, Grassi da Fareneto, Conti Leoni, Caraccioli, Rocca, Cassola, Portapudia, and the Counselor Antonio Francesco Maggi. These individuals decided to form a more stable institute in 1781, housed in Felice Gazzola's palace and consisting of a school of figure painting and a school of architecture, ornamentation, and perspective (quadratura). A school of Del nudo was later added, expanded in 1834 with schools of practical arithmetics and Geometry descriptive and linear design. They allowed for students to study in Rome.Nuovissima Guida, page 218. One of the first professors was Carlo Maria Viganoni, then Giuseppe Gherardi , then Lorenzo Toncini. Viganoni donated his collection of stucco models of classic statuary.Nuovissima Guida, page 219. Among its early pupils were Innocente Micliavacca (engraver), Gaetano Monti (painter); Davide Testi (engraver); Valerio Rivetti (sculptor), Lorenzo Toncini, Quaglia an manuscript illuminator, and Aspetti, a painter. The Institute is still localized in the medieval Palace once belonging to the Fontana family, then later to the monastery of San Sisto, until the Count Giovanni Angelo Gazzola obtained it in 1699.

She fought for peace between France and Germany, and for the right of women to vote. She was a candidate for election as President of France in 1947. Early years Jeanne M√©lin was born in 1877 in Carignan, Ardennes, to a bourgeois family. Her father, who ran the family brickyard, was an anti-clerical Republican and supporter of Alfred Dreyfus. He was inspired by the theories of Jean-Baptiste Andr√© Godin, and was a philanthropist who wanted to put an end to poverty. Jeanne M√©lin received a typical education for a girl of her class at the time. She attended the Sainte-Chr√©tienne de Carignan boarding school for her secondary education. In 1898 M√©lin joined Sylvie Hugo Flammarion's association for Peace and Disarmament by Women (La Paix et le D√©sarmement par les Femmes), and founded a branch of the association in the Ardennes. She developed moderate views based on the pacifist and educational virtues of motherhood. From 1900 to 1914 M√©lin fought for a moderate pacifism based on arbitration of disputes within the Peace Through Law Association (ADP: Association de la paix par le droit). She was influenced by the socialist and pacifist Jean Jaur√®s. In 1906 she became a member of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO: Section Fran√ßaise de l'Internationale Ouvri√®re). She also joined the French Union for Women's Suffrage (UFSF: Union Fran√ßaise pour le Suffrage des Femmes), where she advocated a staged approach to giving women the franchise. M√©lin gained a solid reputation as a speaker through her participation in pacifist and feminist conferences in France and Europe between 1910 and 1914. She had advanced views on morality, and in 1907 advocated birth control and sex education for girls as well as boys. World War I The outbreak of World War I (July 1914 ‚Äì November 1918) caused an upheaval in M√©lin's thinking. In August 1914 she was in Brussels at the meeting of European pacifists. She did not accept the passive attitude of German pacifists such Alfred Hermann Fried, who took refuge in Switzerland and avoided comment on German responsibility. She was shocked by the assassination of the anti-militarist leader Jean Jaur√®s. On 24 August 1914 the Germans reached the Ardennes and her home town, where she lived with her aged parents, was bombed. Her brother was mobilized and the factory that she co-directed with him was closed. She took refuge in Dun-sur-Auron, in the Val de Loire. From September 1914 to August 1915 she was a voluntary inspector at the military hospital in Dun-sur-Auron, which received many amputees. From 1915 to 1918 M√©lin became active in creating networks of feminists and radical pacifists. In March and April 1915 M√©lin tried unsuccessfully to persuade the UFSF leaders to support the views of the International Congress of Women for Peace in The Hague (Congr√®s International des Femmes pour la Paix de La Haye), including abolition of war, women's suffrage and international pacifism and feminism. She was unable to obtain a visa to attend the Hague Congress of April‚ÄìMay 1915. In May 1916 M√©lin created Les cuisines coop√©ratives to feed and house refugees from the Ardennes, with the support of the APD. She rehabilitated a run-down hotel in Paris, where she fed and lodged eighty families. The Comit√© d'Action Suffragiste (CAS) was created in December 1917, directed by Jeanne M√©lin, Marthe Bigot and Gabrielle Duch√™ne. The CAS organized meetings to which they tried to attract workers, for example by showing films. As well as agitating for women's suffrage, the CAS wanted to organize a referendum to end the fighting. The CAS members did not agree with the UFSF, which openly supported the Union sacr√©e and took an aggressive nationalist stance in support of the war. At a CAS conference on 7 March 1918 M√©lin and Monette Thomas outlined a new constitution for France based on universal suffrage for women and men. It called for men and women to collaborate in rebuilding the cities that had been destroyed and to define new social and international laws. In the 1920s the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) would take up this cause. However, the CAS was unable to make its voice heard by the politicians. Later years Catherine E. Marshall, Sir George Paish, Jane Addams, Cornelia Ramondt-Hirschmann, M√©lin - Emergency Peace Conference at the Hague \\"Conference for a New Peace\\" in 1922 After the war M√©lin continued to agitate for pacifism, under the slogan \\"Never Again\\". She placed great hopes in Communism, but was later disappointed. Jeanne M√©lin was one of two French delegates who attended the International Congress of Women in Zurich in May 1919 and swore to work towards the union of women \\"in order that war may never more dishonor humanity.\\" She shook hands with Lida Gustava Heymann (1868-1943), who led the German section, and said that the courage of the German pacifists had \\"saved the honor of their fatherland\\". The French section of the WILPF was close to the French Communist Party, and was attacked by the critics of that party. M√©lin left the French Communist Party in 1923. She remained active in the WILPF in fighting for internationalism and establishment of international laws. In 1924 she presented her Cahiers de la Paix (Notes on Peace) at the Washington congress of the WILPF. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) she was again active. Women obtained the right to vote in 1944 after the liberation of France. M√©lin was a candidate for Presidency of the Republic in 1946. Her program called for full civil equality, political and economic of both sexes, and the election of a Vice-President of the Republic. M√©lin's feminism became subdued after this. In the last years of her life she espoused utopian socialist views in which she advocated the abolition of wage labor, the equitable distribution of wealth, and peaceful decolonization.

Recording More than half the songs on Memphis Beat were recorded on January 5 and 6, 1966 at Phillips Studio in Memphis. The remaining selections were taken from a rare New York City session eight months earlier and Lewis's earliest sessions at Smash in 1963. The album includes a rare Lewis original called \\"Lincoln Limousine,\\" a garbled tribute to John F. Kennedy. In his book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, Joe Bonomo calls the track \\"simply weird, so ambiguous and amateurishly written that it's impossible to determine exactly what motivated him to write it.\\" The album also includes \\"Too Young,\\" a piano lounge number that Bonomo deems \\"a real laugher\\" and \\"hysterically uncomfortable.\\" Lewis fares better on \\"Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\\" and the George Jones classic \\"She Thinks I Still Care,\\" but the collection contained no new hits. Reception After Memphis Beat was released in May 1966, it stalled at 145 on the Billboard albums chart despite solid promotion from Smash and decent reviews. Lewis's commercial slump would continue until 1968, when he finally broke on the country charts with \\"Another Place, Another Time.\\" In 2014 Lewis biographer Rick Bragg wrote, \\"Throughout the mid-1960s he cut one album after another of other people's music...But none of it was new, not really.\\" Bruce Eder of AllMusic praises the album: \\"After veering hard into country (and country-pop) territory with Country Songs for City Folks, Jerry Lee Lewis came roaring back with Memphis Beat in 1966, featuring his hardest rocking sounds in years, and a band who were as good as any with whom he'd ever recorded.\\" Track listing Category:1966 albums Category:Jerry Lee Lewis albums ","title":"Memphis Beat (album)"},{"id":"45279330","text":"Nora Aceval (born 1953, Tousnina) is a traditional storyteller and writer from Algeria. Biography Aceval was born of a French-Algerian father and an Arab mother in Tousnina, on the high plateau of Tiaret Province. Her childhood in Tousnina and Sougueur was permeated with the stories told by the women of the tribe of Ouled Sidi Khaled. She got a degree in nursing and then a master's in modern literature. She collects, retells, translates, writes, and transcribes stories from Algeria, particularly from the region of Djebel AmourMich√®le Perret, \\"Le Maghreb, les femmes et le libertinage\\" : http://mondesfrancophones.com/espaces/maghrebs/le-maghreb-les-femmes-et-le- libertinage-tresors-de-la-culture-orale/ and from women of the Maghreb. Her stories appeal to all ages. Children are interested in the tales and characters, while adults are interested in the ideas expressed trying to find a connection between the story and their own life. She lives in Creil, in France.  Writing Style  A large portion of her writing style is attributed to the oral heritage she had inherited from growing up in Algeria. She operates using a literary style known as a naked voice, which is a dialogue that connects between different cultures. She likes to focus on women in her stories, and how they are not simply objects. Examples of themes Aceval writes about include inequality of women, sexual triumph and finding identity. Aceval revolves her writing around the theme of love. Her style of writing can be described as smooth and simple.  Personal life  Aceval currently has four children.

Interaction with other proteins indicate that TMEM143 could potentially play a role in tumor suppression/expression and cancer regulation. Gene Located on the negative strand of human DNA, TMEM143 spans 31,882 base pairs on human chromosome 19 (19q13.33), neighbored by genes Coiled-coil domain containing 114 (CCDC114) and ER lumen protein-retaining receptor 1 (KDELR1). Transcript In humans, there are five transcript variants encoded by TMEM143 gene (1-5). Variant 1 is the longest mRNA transcript, with a coding region of 2577 nucleotides (nt) and a total of 8 exons, and possibly most indicative of function. Compared to variant 1, variant 2 (2472 nt, 424 amino acid protein) and variant 3 (2382nt, 394 amino acid protein) lack an in-frame exon in the 5' coding region while variant 4 (2277 nt, 359 amino acid protein) lacks two in-frame exons in the 5‚Äô coding region, all leading to an N-terminally truncated protein. Transcript variant 5 is a non-coding RNA, approximately 2231 nt long, resulting in a transcript candidate for nonsense-mediated mRNA. Protein There are four protein isoforms, corresponding to a matching variant. Variant 1 codes for isoform a (the longest protein), and variants 2, 3, 4 code for isoforms b, c, and d, respectively. TMEM143 isoform a is 459 amino acids in length, has a molecular weight of 51.6 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.7 in humans. A domain of unknown function (DUF3754) is present within which two transmembrane domains reside, 24 and 16 amino acids in length, both helical in nature. Scheme of TMEM143 protein: gray markers correspond to phosphorylation sites, red markers correspond to kinase-specific phosphorylation sites, and green sections signify transmembrane domains; DUF3754 is also illustrated The transmembrane domains encompass the uncharged region present at amino acids 278 to 302. A predicted mitochondrial target peptide resides at the N-terminus spanning 52 amino acids before the cleavage site between amino acids M-51 and G-52. In addition, phosphorylation sites, both general and kinase-specific, were predicted to be found throughout the protein, indicating the location of the protein inside the cell. Homology =Orthologs= Orthologs have been identified in more than 85 vertebrate species. No TMEM143 orthologs have yet to be identified in birds. There are currently 85 ortholog species, however all exist as vertebrates only (with the exception of birds), the most distant being Latimeria chalumnae (coelacanth). DUF3754 appears in a majority of the orthologs, a generally conserved region, with slight amino acid alterations to the sequence. This domain has been found in organisms as diverse as bacteria and archaea, however there are no known orthologs in either organismal domain. =Paralogs= There are no known paralogs for the human TMEM143 sequence. Expression and function =Tissue presence= TMEM143 expression in Humans and other primates; In humans, the heart and skeletal muscle exhibit high expression (18.8 and 16.4, respectively) Possible human expression of TMEM143 protein occurs in Jurkat cells (T lymphocyte). Organelle association puts TMEM143 in the mitochondria as an integral protein in the membrane, as well as the predicted of presence in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular matrix and the Golgi apparatus. High expression has been found in the heart and skeletal muscle, as indicated through human expression profiling. Microarray expression of normal human tissues also predict expression in the heart and skeletal muscle, a 95-97 percentile rank (amongst other tissues tested for normal human expression of TMEM143). =Interactions= Through text mining, TMEM143 is shown to have interactions with seven different proteins in humans: Zinc finger protein 541 (ZNF541), DNA-damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DD12), Paraneoplastic Ma antigen family-like 2 (PNMAL2), Kelch-like 31(JLHL31), Chromosome 14 open reading frame 28 (C14orf28), Chromosome 14 open reading frame 28 (TRIN71), and Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB). ZNF541 and PNMAL2, in relation to TMEM143, have been documented as having a role in the allelic loss of q13.3 of chromosome 19. This loss results in documented cases of malignant gliomas, neuroblastomas, and ovarian carcinomas, all suggesting a tumor suppression gene or genes in this region. While TMEM143 is not directly referred to in research in this area, it is present in this region on the chromosome, indicating a potential functional role in humans. Interactions between TMEM143 and DD12, JLHL31, C14orf28, TRIN71, and CPEB (in humans) have been documented through microarray data. Illustrating predicted gene regulation with different microRNA (miRNA) under ionizing radiation conditions, TMEM143 and DD12, JLHL31, C14orf28, TRIN71, and CPEB all share predicted regulatory miRNAs. TMEM143 has also been found to be associated with adipocyte differentiation. Along with other genes, TMEM143 has been documented as a PPARŒ≥ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) target. This indicates the possibility of TMEM143 participation in lipid metabolic pathways and lipid cell differentiation  References  Category:Human proteins ","title":"TMEM143"},{"id":"45279514","text":"Awakening is an album by American saxophonist Sonny Fortune recorded in 1975 and released on the Horizon label.Sonny Fortune discography accessed February 2, 2015 Reception In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said while Awakening featured nothing innovative, it did showcase Fortune's knack for \\"great synthesis\\", including \\"shades of hard bop and late-'50s Miles in a more modal setting, so lyrical and tough-minded that the 12-minute flute-and-congas thing (the title cut, wouldn't you know) becomes quite credible, even listenable.\\" Vincent Thomas for AllMusic calls the album \\"an adequate set of mostly straight-ahead jazz, which sets it apart from many of his fusion- venturing peers of the '70s\\".Thomas, V., [ Allmusic Review] accessed February 2, 2015 Track listing All compositions by Sonny Fortune except where noted. # \\"Triple Threat\\" (Rodgers Grant) - 10:27 # \\"Nommo\\" (Jymie Merritt) - 9:38 # \\"Sunshower\\" (Kenny Barron) - 5:14 # \\"For Duke and Cannon\\" - 2:58 # \\"Awakening\\" - 12:16 Personnel *Sonny Fortune - alto saxophone, flute, cowbell, chimes, claves, shaker, percussion *Charles Sullivan - trumpet, flugelhorn (tracks 1 & 5) *Kenny Barron - piano, electric piano (tracks 1-3 & 5) *John Hicks - piano (track 4) *Wayne Dockery (track 1 & 3-5), Reggie Workman (track 2) - bass *Billy Hart (tracks 1-3 & 5), Chip Lyle (track 4) - drums *Angel Allende - congas, percussion (tracks 2 & 5) References Category:Horizon Records albums Category:Sonny Fortune albums Category:1975 albums ","title":"Awakening (Sonny Fortune album)"},{"id":"45279599","text":"Robert Barrowman (1861 ‚Äì February 17, 1947) was a politician and artist in Alberta, Canada.

One of Judge Hardy's nephews, Charles Brinkmann Peatross, was a Shreveport city attorney and city council member who like his uncle later served on the circuit court of appeal. Career Hardy first practiced law in Shreveport with his father. In 1932, upon his election at the age of thirty-two, Hardy served a single two-year term as mayor of Shreveport, which then operated under the city commission government. In 1943, Governor Sam H.

It was later adapted into TV series, produced by Fuji TV. The manga series ended when Shota won the regional sushi competition in Tokyo. A sequel continued with him being the Tokyo representative in the national competition, to keep a promise for a re-match with his rival Saji Yasuto. Plot Sekiguchi Shota's family operated a small sushi shop in the small city of Otaru, Hokkaido. The business was badly affected by the encroachment of Sasa Zushi (Á¨πÂØøÂè∏), a sushi-chain conglomerate which sought to dominate the market by offering cheaper mass-produced sushi, glitzier facades and suppressing prices of ingredients through bulk purchases. To make matters worse, Shota's mother suffered from incurable illness which drained the family of their savings and disrupted his father's earnings. In an attempt to save the family business, Shota took over his father's, Sekiguchi Genji's, place in a local sushi competition after his father was injured. Despite not winning, Shota impressed one of the judges, Otori Seigoro. Otori Seigoro was owner of O Sushi (È≥≥ÂØøÂè∏), a famous establishment in Tokyo. He offered to take on Shota as an apprentice. Sekiguchi Genji agreed, realising that Shota would need the greater exposure in Tokyo in order to develop himself to face the challenge of reviving the family business. In Tokyo, Shota faced numerous obstacles and realised being a successful sushi master was a lot more than just knowing how to prepare tasty sushi. The two most senior disciples in O Sushi, Fujita Masaji (Ëó§Áî∞Êîø‰∫å) and Okamura Hidemasa (Â≤°ÊùëÁßÄÊîø) were friendly and helpful, but the third disciple, Saji Yasuto (‰ΩêÊ≤ªÂÆâ‰∫∫), frequently bullied the newcomer Shota and the other young apprentice Obata Shingo (Â∞èÁïëÊÖéÂêæ). Otori Seigoro quietly assessed the situation and decided the best way for Shota to master the trade quickly was to allow the rivalry between Shota and Yasuto to develop for the two spur each other. He announced a three-round contest between them to select the representative of O Sushi in the forthcoming Tokyo sushi competition. In the first round, the subject sea bream was deliberately chosen as it was out of season. Both contenders had to source for the fish themselves. Shota's friends managed to find one for him but it was stolen by Yasuto to use in the contest. Despite using an inferior sub-species of the sea bream, Shota won by employing a superior cooking technique. The loss was a blow to Yasuto. It also shook him up and reassess his own approach towards life. The subject was the second round was unagi. The contest favoured Yasuto who revealed he had been brewing his own eel sauce for the past three years - the gravy was a crucial component of preparing the dish. All Japanese chefs serving eels are expected to brew their own sauce, which is maintained continuously through adding new stock. The newcomer Shota was disadvantaged as it would take years to brew a decent sauce. Shota came up with an innovative method of preparing the dish without the use of traditional sauce. Though it was delicious, he lost the round as he failed a critical question posed by Otori Seigoro on the order of serving the dishes. The third round allowed the contestants to select their own ingredients. To encourage a disheartened Obata Shingo who was belittled by Yasuto for losing to a newcomer, Shota opted to use anchovy, a usually unappreciated fish to which Yasuto likened Shingo to. Shota made Shingo promise to stay if he won, which he did. Despite losing the contest, Yasuto matured tremendously in the process and won the recognition from Otori Seigoro who wanted to promote Yasuto to man a counter at the restaurant. Yasuto declined and decided to further his training elsewhere, explaining that he feared his growth would be limited if he remained at O Sushi with Shota. Nevertheless, he swore to Shota he would seek a re-match someday. The story moved to Shota's participation in the Tokyo sushi competition where he continued to learn new things with every round of the tournament. In between, he also had to visit Otaru where Sasa Zushi continued in their attempt to drive his father out of business.

Its chief product, Eyeprint ID, provides verification using eye veins and other micro-features in and around the eye. Images of the human eye are used to authenticate mobile device users. EyeVerify licenses its software for use in mobile banking applications, such as those offered by Tangerine Bank, NCR/Digital Insight and Wells Fargo.  About  EyeVerify is part of the Kansas City Crossroads neighborhood alongside several other tech companies. EyeVerify's flagship product is Eyeprint ID, a system that authenticates users by recognizing patterns of blood vessels that are visible in the sclera, the whites of the eyes, as well as other eye-based micro-features. An independent assessment by iBeta determined that Eyeprint ID meets the requirements for inclusion as a built-in subsystem in an Electronic Prescription of Controlled Substance (EPCS) Application.  History  Entrepreneur Toby Rush founded the company in 2012, some months after visiting the lab of University of Missouri-Kansas City professor Reza Derakhshani, who developed the eye vein verification technology. Derakhshani holds the patent to Eyeprint ID and now serves as the company's chief science officer. In September 2016, EyeVerify was acquired by Alibaba's payments arm, Ant Group for $100 million.  Investors  In September 2016, Ant Group, the financial services arm of Alibaba Group, acquired EyeVerify for an estimated $100M. Prior to that, Wells Fargo, Sprint, Qihoo 360 and Samsung Electronics had invested more than $6 million in EyeVerify. Mid-America Angels and Nebraska Angels were also investors. The company was an early participant in the Wells Fargo Startup Accelerator for innovators in mobile security.  Partners/customers  = Financial services = In April 2016, Tangerine Bank became the first Canadian financial institution to offer Eyeprint ID. The same month, Wells Fargo discussed its summer 2016 implementation of Eyeprint ID with the Wall Street Journal. The large bank mentioned that it had \\"tested voice and facial recognition technologies but found that each was subject to vagaries in the environment,\\" and that \\"Eyeprint ID works correctly more often and is more discrete.\\" In October 2015, RSA Security added Eyeprint ID to its Adaptive Authentication Software Development Kit, after extensive evaluation of the technology, to provide in-app biometric step up authentication for high risk login and transactions. EyeVerify and Olcsan CAD announced a partnership to offer Eyeprint ID to institutions in Turkey and other European countries. Their first project was to integrate with Vodafone Turkey's mobile wallet, Vodafone Cep Cuzdan. Mountain America Credit Union conducted a beta launch of Eyeprint ID as part of its dual biometric authentication system, making it the first financial institution officially to launch Eyeprint ID in the United States. Digital Insight, a division of NCR, announced in February, 2015, that it would incorporate Eyeprint ID into its mobile banking platform. As of October 30, 2015, five Digital Insight Financial Institutions use Eyeprint ID in their mobile banking app: Service Credit Union, Arizona Federal Credit Union, Community America Credit Union, First Internet Bank and Evansville Teachers Federal Credit Union. By the end of 2016, dozens of Digital Insight credit unions had launched Eyeprint ID. EyeVerify also has partnerships with other technology companies that serve the financial services industry, including Comarch, Hypr and BioConnect.

Originating in Miller Beach in Gary, it flows through the cities of Gary, East Chicago and Hammond, as well as Calumet City and Burnham on the Illinois side. The majority of the river's flow drains into Lake Michigan via the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal, sending about per second of water into the lake. A smaller part of the flow, at the river's western end, enters the Calumet River and ultimately drains into the Illinois and ultimately the Mississippi River. Today, a large portion of the river's flow originates as municipal and industrial effluent, cooling and process water and storm water overflows. Although discharges have been reduced, a number of contaminants continue to impair the area. The river is among the country's most severely polluted, and as of 2015 was in the late stages of a major dredging project to remove thousands of tons of contaminated sediment and rehabilitate the river ecosystem. Course The Grand Calumet is divided into an East and West branch, on the respective sides of the Indiana Harbor Canal. The East Branch, which drains entirely into Lake Michigan, rises in Marquette Park in Gary's Miller Beach neighborhood, passing through a series of three lagoons before flowing into the Miller Woods unit of Indiana Dunes National Park and then on to the industrial zone of Gary. It leaves Gary by passing under Cline Avenue, and then defines the boundary between East Chicago and Hammond until reaching the Indiana Harbor Canal near Kennedy Avenue. The West Branch drains partly into the Indiana Harbor Canal and partly into the Calumet River, which drains into the Chicago Area Waterway System and ultimately into the Illinois River. The divide between the part of the West Branch flowing into the Illinois River and the part flowing to Lake Michigan is in Hammond, Indiana, near the Illinois-Indiana state line. The West Branch joins the Little Calumet at Burnham, Illinois. In addition, the Indiana Harbor Canal itself is sometimes treated as a part of the Grand Calumet, which brings the river's total length to . Geology The Grand Calumet flows through the Calumet Lacustrine Plain, a region of low, undulating sandy terrain adjoining Lake Michigan. Groundwater contributions to the river, which account for less than 10% of total flow, come from the Calumet Aquifer, an unconfined water-table aquifer. The Calumet Aquifer is less than 10 feet below the surface in most areas, and has an average thickness of 40 feet. History Aerial view of the Indiana Harbor Canal at Lake Michigan Prior to the industrialization of the Chicago area and the creation of the Chicago Area Waterway System, the Grand Calumet flowed into Lake Michigan at Marquette Park in Miller Beach, near where its headwaters now lie. In this original configuration, the Grand Calumet included much of what is now the Little Calumet River, while the original \\"Little Calumet\\" was just a minor stream draining out into Lake Calumet. This original river is sometimes called by the older name Konomick or Kennomick to distinguishing it from the Grand Calumet of today; the term comes from the Miami kinwikami, or \\"long water river\\". This arrangement began to shift in the early 19th century, either in 1805 or between 1809 and 1820, when some combination of flooding and human excavation opened up a channel allowing the upper Grand Calumet (now Little Calumet) to drain directly into Lake Calumet via the original Little Calumet channel. This created the basic definitions of the rivers as they exist today, as what had been the upper reaches of the Grand Calumet now became part of the Little Calumet. The Grand Calumet at this point still flowed from west to east, emptying into the lake at Miller Beach. In 1848, the Calumet Feeder Canal was constructed to carry water from the Calumet system at Blue Island to the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which was suffering from low water levels. This reversed the flow of the Grand Calumet, so that it now flowed from east to west, draining out of Lake Michigan at Miller Beach. By 1872, the river's original mouth at Miller had been completely blocked by sandbars. Industrial development on the banks of the Grand Calumet began in the late 19th century, starting with the George Hammond packing company in Hammond. The accumulation of industrial sediment in the river had become problematic by 1885. The construction of the Gary Works in 1905 involved diverting and channelizing a considerable part of the East Branch to make way for the new steel mill. Previously, the Grand Calumet had flowed across a large part of the present-day mill site, and spread to 1,000 feet wide during floods. In 1906, the Indiana Harbor Canal was completed, again reversing the flow in the eastern portion of the West Branch and creating the approximate flows that exist today, with the East Branch and eastern part of the West Branch emptying into Lake Michigan at Indiana Harbor, while the remainder of the West Branch flows west. Continuing industrialization along the Grand Calumet led to steadily increasing levels of pollution. By the mid-20th century, the river \\"had become an industrial sewer, incapable of supporting any life except for blue-green algae and sludgeworms.\\" Pollution The USS Smelter and Lead Refinery site, one of several Superfund sites along the Grand Calumet. Approximately 90% of the flow of the Grand Calumet consists of industrial and municipal effluent. The portion of the Grand Calumet within Indiana has been designated a Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AoC) under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, one of 43 sites favored with such a designation. The Grand Calumet has been listed as one of the 43 AoCs since 1986. AoCs are designated by having an impairment in at least one of fourteen beneficial uses. The Grand Calumet is the only AoC to be impaired on all fourteen. These impairments include total fish consumption restrictions, beach closings, fish tumors or deformities, animal deformities or reproductive problems, and loss or degradation of fish and wildlife habitat, benthos, phytoplankton, and zooplankton populations, among others. As of 2015, a major dredging project was under way to remove several hundred thousand tons of toxic sediment from the bottom of the Grand Calumet. The dredging was expected to be complete in 2016. The largest extent of the river's impairment comes from the historical sediment contamination by the industrial activities already mentioned. Today, sediments on the river bottom are \\"among the most contaminated and toxic that have ever been reported.\\" Only sludge worms inhabit the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal, indicating that severe pollution exists. The Grand Calumet suffers from contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). and heavy metals, such as mercury, cadmium, chromium and lead. Additional problems include high fecal coliform bacteria levels, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids, oil and grease. These contaminants originate from both point and nonpoint sources. =Nonpoint sources= *Contaminated sediment: The Grand Calumet River and Indiana Harbor and Canal contain 5 to 10 million cubic yards (3.9 to 7.7 million m3) of contaminated sediment up to 20 feet (6 m) deep. Contaminants include toxic compounds (e.g., PAHs, PCBs and heavy metals) and conventional pollutants (e.g., phosphorus, nitrogen, iron, magnesium, volatile solids, oil and grease). *Industrial waste site runoff: Stormwater runoff and leachate from 11 of 38 waste disposal and storage sites in the AoC, located within 0.2 miles (300 m) of the river, are degrading the water quality. Contaminants include oil, heavy metals, arsenic, PCBs, PAHs and lead. *Superfund sites: There are 52 sites in the AoC listed in the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) System, more commonly known as Superfund. Five of these sites are on the National Priorities List. *Hazardous waste sites under RCRA: There are 423 hazardous waste sites in the AoC regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), such as landfills or surface impoundments, where hazardous waste is disposed. Twenty-two of these sites are treatment, storage and disposal facilities. *Underground storage tanks (USTs): There are more than 460 underground storage tanks in the AoC. More than 150 leaking tank reports have been filed for the Lake County section of the AoC since mid-1987. *Atmospheric deposition: Atmospheric deposition of toxic substances from fossil fuel burning, waste incineration and evaporation enter the AoC through direct contact with water, surface water runoff and leaching of accumulated materials deposited on land. Toxins from this source include dioxins, PCBs, insecticides and heavy metals. *Urban runoff: Rain water passing over paved urban areas washes grease, oil and toxic organics such as PCBs and PAHs into the surface waters. *Contaminated groundwater: Groundwater contaminated with organic compounds, heavy metals and petroleum products contaminates surface waters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that at least 16.8 million US gallons (64,000 m3) of oil float on top of groundwater beneath the AoC. =Point sources of contaminants= *Industrial and Municipal Wastewater Discharges: Three steel manufacturers contribute 90 percent of industrial point source discharges to river. One chemical manufacturer also discharges into the river. Permitted discharges include arsenic, cadmium, cyanide, copper, chromium, lead and mercury. Three municipal treatment works (Gary, Hammond and East Chicago Sanitary Districts) discharge treated domestic and industrial wastewater. *Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs): Fifteen CSOs contribute untreated municipal waste, including conventional and toxic pollutants, to the river. Annually, CSO outfalls discharge an estimated 11 billion US gallons (42,000,000 m3) of raw wastewater into the harbor and river. Approximately 57% of the annual CSO volume is discharged within eight miles (13 km) of Lake Michigan, resulting in nearshore fecal coliform contamination. Watershed The total area drained by the Grand Calumet is less than 50 square miles. It is one of the region's smallest watersheds. =Flora and fauna= Fish populations in most of the Grand Calumet were virtually wiped out in the 20th century, although the headwaters area continues to support sensitive native species including the Iowa darter. The fish community in most of the river today is dominated by exotic and nonindigenous detritivores. A string of nature preserves operated by The Nature Conservancy, the Shirley Heinze Land Trust and the Lake County Parks Department run along the banks of the lower East Branch in Gary, East Chicago and Hammond. Known as the Tolleston Strand Plain, the preserves are home to the dune and swale habitat, which once covered large areas around the Great Lakes but is now considered globally rare. Dune and swale complexes are known for their high levels of biodiversity. Endangered and threatened species in these nature preserves along the Grand Calumet include the Karner blue butterfly. Other rare species include the Franklin's ground squirrel, Blanding's turtle, the glass lizard and the black-crowned night heron.

Wells defeated Casey in the special election to fill his father's unexpired term, 136,860 votes to 135,185. Casey challenged Wells in 1968, but lost 159,438 votes to 108,323. Death Casey died on October 15, 1992.

After being launched in 2009 by Nikolas Chugay, the diet was criticized by health experts and media outlets.  History  Tongue Patch Diet was developed by Chugay, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, in 2009. Chugay got the idea of the diet from a friend who was doing a similar procedure in Mexico. Chugay introduced the tongue patch diet as an alternative to invasive weight loss methods such as gastric bypass or Lapband surgery. In 2011, a similar procedure was introduced in Venezuela. However, the procedure gained more popularity in Venezuela as compared to the USA. As of 2014, Chugay is the only surgeon in the USA who offers this treatment and it has not been approved by FDA.  Procedure  In the Tongue Patch Diet, a patch is stitched to the tongue of the dieter to make the consumption of solid food painful. The patch is made of Marlex, a polymer composed of polypropylene and high-density polyethylene. The procedure for stitching the patch to the tongue takes about ten minutes. Since consuming solid food is painful, the dieter has to resort to a restrictive 800-calorie liquid only diet developed by Chugay. The patch can be removed any time by snipping the sutures. However, it should be removed within a month or the tongue may start growing on the patch. Some patients have had the mesh in place up to 60 days without untoward effects. In the days subsequent to the procedure, the patient takes antibiotics for 3 days to minimize the risk of infection and washes with an antiseptic mouth wash to decrease the bacterial count. According to Chugay, the diet can help a patient in reducing 30 pounds in one month. Chugay and his son Paul Chugay published a study in the American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery that said 70 percent of their patients lost an average of 16 pounds and kept it off for eight months.  Risks  Patients may have a swollen tongue or difficulty speaking for the first 72 hours after the procedure. Chugay claims that the diet has no severe risks or side effects. Critics of the diet have labelled it as dangerous claiming that it could cause infection, swelling or nerve damage. Others have claimed that the patch could dislodge and go down the throat and cause an airway obstruction.  In mass media  After being launched, the diet has received considerable media attention, with health experts criticizing the diet. Physician Robert Huizenga called the diet \\"a primitive approach.\\" Many media outlets have also reviewed the diet negatively with Good Magazine writing that \\"in essence it's nothing more than a modern version of wiring one's jaw shut, forcing the \\"patient\\" to literally starve themselves.\\"  See also  * List of diets  References  Category:Diets Category:Fad diets ","title":"Tongue Patch Diet"},{"id":"45280343","text":"The Super Bowl LI Halftime show took place on February 5, 2017 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, as part of Super Bowl LI. Lady Gaga headlined the show, with no special guests (the first since Super Bowl XLIV), performing a medley of her hit songs, including material from her then-most recent studio album, Joanne (2016). The performance was met with critical acclaim, and received 6 Emmy Award nominations, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lighting Design / Lighting Direction for a Variety Special. Gaga began rehearsing for the show in January 2017. Her sister gave her the idea of performing from atop the NRG Stadium; Gaga worked on the logistics behind it. She promoted the performance by uploading short clips on her social media accounts. Fashion house Versace created the wardrobe for the show with a custom jumpsuit for the singer, while designers Bruce Rodgers and LeRoy Bennett did the show's production work with lighting designer Bob Barnhart of 22 Degrees. The stage was created by All Access Staging & Productions, which had also created previous Super Bowl halftime stages. During the introduction scene, Gaga was accompanied by a fleet of 300 drones provided by Intel, which formed an image of the American flag behind the singer. It marked the first time the drones had been used as part of a television broadcast. The halftime show was critically acclaimed, with media outlets praising Gaga for demonstrating artistic and musical qualities. Some argued it was one of the top Super Bowl halftime performances in history. The show was also noted for its acknowledgment of the LGBT community, the perceived political undertones, and the technical achievement of the use of drones. With 117.5 million television viewers, it was the second most-watched Super Bowl halftime show after Super Bowl XLIX and had higher average viewership than the game itself. Gaga's music catalogue benefited from the performance, with sales growth for all her records. The song \\"Million Reasons\\" from Joanne, which was part of the set list, consequently became her 14th top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Synopsis alt=NRG Stadium, bird's eye view. The halftime show began on the roof of NRG Stadium. Lady Gaga started singing \\"God Bless America\\" as drones swarm behind her emitting red, white and blue color. She then sang Woody Guthrie's \\"This Land Is Your Land\\", followed by the ending of the Pledge of Allegiance: \\"One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\" Gaga then dove from the rooftop as the drones behind her formed the design of the US flag. The singer came down and stood on a tall pillar across the stage, and performed \\"Poker Face\\" as fireworks lit up behind her. After the first verse and chorus, Gaga, attached to a harness, bounced from the pillar to the main stage. Her dancers joined her as she sang \\"Born This Way\\", which included the track's intermediate spoken verse. As the performance ended, Gaga headed towards one corner of the stage inside a star-shaped structure and sang \\"Telephone\\". A dancer carried her to the main stage where she held a keytar and performed \\"Just Dance\\". The singer moved from the stage to the ground as the song ended. She reached a podium with a piano and began singing \\"Million Reasons\\"; the audience present on the field drifted off in different directions holding light sticks. Continuing the song, she came down from the podium and hugged members of the audience. For the finale of \\"Bad Romance\\", a team of white-clad dancers strutted across the main stage. Gaga joined them wearing a football inspired costume and performed the track. As fireworks erupted heralding the end of the show, Gaga reached the edge of the stage, shouted \\"Super Bowl 51\\", dropped her microphone, and jumped off the stage catching a football. Background national anthem at the Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016alt=Lady Gaga in a red pant-suit walking on a field. Around August 2016, media outlets began reporting that Adele was in discussions with the National Football League (NFL) to perform at the Super Bowl LI halftime show, on February 5, 2017, at Houston's NRG Stadium. Pepsi Zero Sugar sponsored the show. During her Adele Live 2016 concert tour in Los Angeles, Adele clarified that although she had been asked to perform by the NFL, she had declined since she did not believe she was suitable for the halftime show. The NFL explained they had not signed any musician and were still in discussions with several artists. In the meantime Lady Gaga announced that she would be releasing her fifth studio album, Joanne, in October 2016. Billboard reported that the NFL was is discussions with the singer, because of her performance of the national anthem at the previous Super Bowl. On September 29, 2016, Gaga confirmed on her Instagram account that she would be performing at the halftime show. Fox Sports president and executive producer of the show, John Entz, confirmed Gaga's involvement. He added, \\"[She] is one of the most electric performers of our generation, and we couldn't be happier with the choice to have her headline the Super Bowl LI Halftime Show... It is going to be an incredible night.\\" According to Emma Quigley, Pepsi's North American head of music, and Justin Toman, Pepsi sports marketing director, choosing Gaga to headline the show made sense based on her previous musical output and endeavors. They considered various parameters‚Äîsocial media followers, record sales, trending topic‚Äîand then shortlisted her. Toman also took into account the total time it usually takes for the show‚Äîseven minutes for set up, 12 minutes for the main show, and another seven minutes to dismantle‚Äîand believed the singer could deliver \\"power, punch, performance, singing, lights\\" within that time frame. Pepsi sponsored the halftime show for the fifth-consecutive year. Development =Conception= alt=Lady Gaga standing atop a skeletal structure and singing, as red light is seen behind her. In October 2016, Gaga told Entertainment Weekly she wanted to give \\"the best show for the football fans, the ones that are watching at home\\". Although indecisive about the set list, the singer wanted to play a mixture of her past and recent songs. She also confirmed that the NFL heard Joanne before its release and decided to offer her the halftime performance slot. Her inspiration came from earlier halftime performances by Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, and Bruce Springsteen. Gaga remarked that she loved \\"all the [past shows]\\". In December 2016, Gaga launched the \\"Guest of Honor\\" contest with Pepsi and the NFL. This would give her fans the opportunity to see the halftime show from the stage's sidelines. The singer uploaded a video titled Fanifesto, talking about the power of fandom. She explained that to win fans had to upload a 15‚Äì60 second video on Instagram or Twitter with the hashtags #GOHContest and #PepsiHalftime by December 15, professing their fandom for Gaga. Billboard Colin Stutz revealed that Gaga would not be accompanied by any guest musicians, which was different from the shows of the past few years. Pepsi confirmed in a press release that a ten-second countdown would precede Gaga's performance, when a lead-in, produced by Creator's Studio featuring jazz singer Tony Bennett, would be shown. Gaga confirmed her plan to sing atop the dome of NRG Stadium, an idea given to her by her sister Natali Germanotta. Her team were worried about the safety hazards associated with the stunt, although Gaga continued to pursue it. The organizers considered airlifting the singer to the top of the dome before the performance, or making her appear through the \\"see-through\\" roof of the stadium, which is retractable. Gaga's lawyers worked on the logistics and the insurance associated with the stunt. US media had expected Gaga to do \\"something overtly political\\" during her performance. The NFL refuted news that they had forbidden the singer from mentioning President Donald Trump during the show. A representative from the organization issued a statement saying, \\"The Super Bowl is a time when people really come together. Lady Gaga is focused on putting together an amazing show for fans and we love working with her on it; we aren't going to be distracted by this.\\" =Rehearsals= By January 2017, Gaga began posting images on her social media accounts, showing her practicing for the show. She built a tent in her backyard where she rehearsed with her dancers. The group rehearsed in it for more than a week, then moved to larger venues in Hollywood to work on the rest of the show. Finally, all the equipment was sent to Houston, where the final rehearsals took place. Gaga enlisted vocal coach Don Lawrence to help her belt out the correct notes. Lawrence worked with Gaga for her National Anthem performance the previous year, as well as her concert tours. Pepsi uploaded a behind-the-scenes video from the rehearsals, where Gaga explained the main challenge was how to make the halftime performance different from the preceding years but keep it still about the music. Choreographer Richy Jackson was shown in the middle of a session with the dancers, displaying the characteristic moves from the song, \\"Bad Romance\\" (2009). Jackson said the dancers were hand-picked and had worked before with the singer. He added the show would unveil a different aspect of Gaga, since she had never had the opportunity to perform on a big world stage like the Super Bowl. As the day of the show approached, the singer kept posting short videos from rehearsals as well as behind-the-scenes. She showed her pre-game dance routines and choreography, FaceTimeing with her grandmother, warming up for the show, and the onstage activities. Toman explained that they wanted to have fans get \\"a peek into the journey to halftime, tapping into the artist fanbase‚Äîthat really works. Doing a behind-the-scenes content program, giving people that glimpse of what it takes to prepare. People love that. So that really worked and we continue to do that.\\" In an interview with Billboard, Gaga explained: \\"I really had a real sense of being in the zone for this performance, worked on it for a really long time, took months, trained hard. Every second I wanted to give the world and my fans what they deserve, a great show. Its really exciting, I wanted to enjoy the moment not just be hell bent [sic] on everything.\\" =Fashion= alt=Lady Gaga in the jumpsuit pointing her microphone towards the audience from onstage. After the release of Joanne, Gaga wore simple outfits, deviating from her previously outrageous attire. Before the halftime show, there was much speculation about what she would wear for the performance. Versace created all the looks for the show, including the final one inspired by the label's Spring 2017 collection. The singer wore a custom, Atelier Versace, iridescent colored jumpsuit, beaded all over with Swarovski crystals, with high shoulder pads and matching knee-length boots. The body suit facilitated swift movement onstage, aiding Gaga's mobility. According to fashion expert Cameron Silver, Gaga's look for the performance of \\"Bad Romance\\" was the \\"most interesting\\". It consisted of silver hot pants with sequins, with a football shoulder-pad like jacket. Billboard deemed both the outfits a \\"customary nod\\" to Gaga's past adding, \\"It was a solid balance of glam and sexy without overdoing it [...] [The dress] gave fantasy to her fans. She looked great. She sounded great. It's like she was playing football in heels.\\" Gaga also wore a golden jacket which had shoulder spikes while playing the keytar, . Gaga's longtime collaborator Brandon Maxwell styled her looks; singer David Bowie's persona Ziggy Stardust influenced her makeup. Donatella Versace flew to Houston to help with the costumes, including dressing the singer before the show. Sarah Nicole Tanno did Gaga's makeup, and Frederic Aspiras coiffed her hair. Tanno used products from Marc Jacobs' cosmetics line to give Gaga a \\"timeless\\" look. The singer wore a pair of eye masks made of crystals, extending to her temples. According to Vanessa Friedman of The New York Times choosing Versace as her fashion brand for the costumes \\"helped to support a subtler, arguably more powerful, message\\" by Gaga. She had promised to make the show about \\"inclusion\\" and to that extent, using Versace and a number of other designers like Dr. Martens and Vera Wang made the point. =Multimedia= alt=A faraway dark-lit image with minuscule lights going in straight line from the center where a stage can be seen. Designers Bruce Rodgers of Tribe Inc., LeRoy Bennett, and lighting designer Bob Barnhart of 22 Degrees handled the show's production work. All Access Staging & Productions, creators of previous Super Bowl halftime stages, built the stage. Its key features included a main platform, two towers, three star- shaped side stages, a piano dome and a stage lift. The towers were about tall and could be carried by carts to the field for set-up. All Access had just over four weeks to create the pieces and the main stage. It required 17 trucks for storage and transport. The show used a LED system from Verrents and sound by ATK Audiotek. A record number of about 5,000 LED lights were embedded in the stage. Special effects group Strictly FX handled the pyrotechnics. Both Rodgers and Bennett combined their ideas for the show, with input from Barnhart and special effects designer Mark Grega from FX. Rodgers described the stage setup as \\"the most intense technological and visually impactful epic possible\\". The show featured a field cast led by KP Terry; they used Glow Motion LED batons, creating a 3D moving pixel show. Glow Motion, a Nashville- based company, programmed each individual baton to sync with the music being played. \\"All our field cast and staging experts, technicians and vendors [had] stepped up to support the vision, and Gaga herself, having embraced the concept early on, [had] taken on the task with more interest and heart than any other artist that I've worked with in the last 11 years,\\" Rodgers concluded. Production Resource Group (PRG) supplied the show's lighting. PRG's Chris Conti shared Barnhart's floor plan for the lighting setup, which used DMX512 to control the system. Barnhart recalled that \\"[the] show was a little more complicated this year, due to the amount of scenery that we normally don't have on a halftime show\\", but it was better since there were no video backdrops. An array of 36 Clay Paky Sharpy fixtures was added around the roof of NRG Stadium, which lit the Houston night sky with light beams. Barnhart also arranged a backlight array fixture, using Philips Vari-Lite VL4000 and PRG Best Boy. LED tape, controlled by the lighting team, was used around the main production area. They could light the stage from afar. Director Hamish Hamilton and his crew devised their own way of capturing and transmitting the show for the live audience. =Drones= alt=A faraway image of a stage with purple lights flashing from all around on it. While performing on top of NRG Stadium, a fleet of 300 synchronized, LED-equipped \\"Shooting Star\\" quadcopter drones provided by Intel accompanied Gaga. They formed an image of the American flag behind the singer. This marked the first time the drones were used as part of a television broadcast. According to Intel's senior vice president Josh Walden, \\"Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before ... The potential for these light show drones is endless.\\" Barnhart explained he had wanted to use drones in the Super Bowl for many years, but never encountered the appropriate technology until Intel's drones. With permission from producer Ricky Kirshner, he reached out to Intel representatives and told them he wanted to use their drone technology for a \\"large TV show in February. I can't give you money, but I can give you exposure.\\" Knowing that the Super Bowl would expose their technology to over 110 million television sets across the country, Intel agreed. Since the drones did not fly indoors, Barnhart wrote a new creative segment for the opening with Gaga singing atop the roof of the stadium and the drones flying behind her. The segment was filmed earlier in the week due to safety concerns over flying the formation over a live audience. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) forbid the use of drones within a radius of NRG Stadium (which is also located near William P. Hobby Airport). The production staff obtained special permission from the FAA to perform the drone acrobatics. Intel began preparing in early December 2016, working out the logistics. After coming to a consensus with the creative team, they began storyboarding the drones, finally deciding to display a star array, the American flag and the Pepsi logo. The drones used for the show had a plastic and foam body for soft impacts, were about square and weighed . They were connected wirelessly to a central computer and each executed their unique, individual choreography. The computer checked the GPS signal strength and the drones' battery levels. Critical response alt=A faraway image of a stage with a performance going on, surrounded by a huge crowd. Gaga's performance was critically acclaimed. A writer for Time described the show as \\"among the very best in the history of the form, racing ambitiously through the artist's entire career and putting forward the qualities of the artist that just work\\". The New Yorker review described Gaga and the show as \\"an astute, intense, and disciplined performance\\". Andrew Unterberger of Billboard felt the performance would go down as \\"one of the best halftime sets of the century\\" and that it had cemented her as a \\"legacy artist... It was Gaga through and through, and every song felt more gratifying than the last... reminding you why Gaga's pop supremacy was so inarguable not all that long ago.\\" He noted that there was nothing \\"outrageous\\" in the show. Chris Chase of Fox Sports said the halftime show would \\"go down with Michael, Prince, Beyonc√©, and Bruce as the greatest ever.\\" Marguerite Ward from CNBC considered the show Gaga's comeback, noting how she had announced in 2015 that she would retire. \\"Fast forward to 2017. [Lady Gaga] is back on the global stage, gearing up for a new world tour\\", she added. Writing for Variety, Sonia Saraiya described the show as \\"breathtaking\\" and \\"soar[ing]\\", but felt it \\"lacked an iconic moment or emotional button\\". Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter was disappointed the show never had a \\"close-up or any sort of swooping medium-shot to accentuate [Gaga's] movement\\". He felt that the show lacked any political messages and that \\"the weakly presented dive\\" detracted from her rendition of \\"God Bless America\\" and \\"This Land Is Your Land\\". Nico Land of Salon noted Gaga was the first artist to refer to the LGBT community during a Super Bowl halftime show when she sang \\"Born This Way\\". Land considered this a \\"crucial milestone\\" for the community. He said, \\"Putting LGBT issues on the main stage at the Super Bowl served as a powerful message of queer solidarity in the face on an unprecedented wave of challenges from our government.\\" Although Gaga did not openly criticize Trump, Land viewed the singer's opening performance was a subtle \\"dig\\" at the President. Singing \\"This Land Is Your Land\\", a protest anthem for the Women's Marches across the country following Trump's inauguration, Gaga referred to Trump's policies on immigration. According to Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair, the performance was a \\"dog whistle\\" against Trump's plans to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. At the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, the halftime show was nominated in six categories‚Äîthe most by any halftime show‚Äî including: Outstanding Special Class Program, Outstanding Production Design for Variety, Nonfiction, Event or Award Special, Outstanding Lighting Design / Lighting Direction for a Variety Special, Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video Control for a Limited Series, Movie, or Special, Outstanding Music Direction, and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Variety Series or Special and won for Outstanding Lighting Design. Commercial reception alt=Lady Gaga playing a keytar while wearing a gold jacket. In the United States, the Super Bowl LI halftime show attracted 117.5 million television viewers. It was the second-most-watched halftime show behind Super Bowl XLIX in 2015. For the fourth year in a row, the viewership was higher than the game, which was viewed by an audience of 111.3 million. A total of 5.1 million tweets were made about Gaga's performance, including 2.2 million during her show, making her the most tweeted about entertainer in the show's history. According to statistics presented by Billboard, the most tweeted moments were when the show ended, followed by Gaga waving at her parents from the stage, and when the singer descended from the NRG Stadium roof in a harness. The set list was also included in the most tweets tabulation with \\"Bad Romance\\" getting the highest number of tweets. \\"Telephone\\" was the second most-tweeted song followed by \\"Born This Way\\". According to Nielsen SoundScan on the day of the show, Gaga sold 150,000 digital albums and songs in the United States, up by 1,000% from the previous day. The singer sold a total of 125,000 digital song downloads, led by \\"Million Reasons\\" (45,000 up by 900%), then \\"Bad Romance\\" (13,000), \\"Born This Way\\" (12,000) and \\"Poker Face\\" (10,000). Her albums sold more than 23,000 downloads with Joanne selling over 12,000 copies, followed by The Fame Monster (2009), which sold about 6,000. Gaga acquired over 24,000 listeners on music streaming website Pandora Radio. Total station adds for the singer went up by 1,391% week-by-week with a cumulative 14.8 million stations and her songs received 2.5 billion spins. All the songs performed received significant spin boosts. This was different from the previous halftime shows, when Coldplay was up by 225%, Bruno Mars by 62%, and Beyonc√© up 60%. After the final tabulation, Gaga sold over 410,000 digital song downloads for the tracking week of February 9, 2017, an increase of 1,850%. \\"Million Reasons\\" (which dropped off the chart the previous week),) re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number four becoming Gaga's 14th top-ten single. It also reached the top of the Digital Songs chart with 149,000 downloads. Other songs entering the Digital Songs chart were \\"Born This Way\\" (41,000, number seven), \\"Bad Romance\\" (39,000, number nine) \\"Poker Face\\" (34,000, number fourteen), \\"Just Dance\\" (25,000, number 26) and \\"Telephone\\" (20,000, number 39). Gaga's streaming activity increased by 196% to 41.8 million streams, led by \\"Million Reasons\\" with 3.9 million plays. Her album sales increased by 844% to 135,000 equivalent units, with Joanne rising from number 66‚Äì2 on the Billboard 200, selling 74,000 units (48,000 traditional album sales). Other entries on the chart included The Fame (38,000, number 6), Born This Way (17,000, number 25) and Artpop (5,000, number 174). Gaga reached number one on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, which measures activity across various social media websites as well as record sales. The Super Bowl performance also had an impact in Canada, where Joanne vaulted from number 54‚Äì2, with a 524% gain in album-equivalent units. In the United Kingdom, Joannes sales were up by 222%, while The Fame (2008) was up by 1,605% after the show. On the UK Albums Chart, the former moved from number 88‚Äì11, with sales increasing to 5,289 copies, while the latter entered at number 38, selling 2,263 copies.

Justin Timberlake was the featured performer, as confirmed by the National Football League (NFL) on October 22, 2017. It was televised nationally by NBC. It received four nominations at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards. Synopsis Timberlake with dancers during the halftime performance The show began with Jimmy Fallon introducing Justin Timberlake, followed by a video screen depicting Timberlake performing \\"Filthy\\" in a club setting below the field level of the stadium. He then walked up a staircase and appeared on a ramp stage extending outward into the field, descending into a series of stages surrounded by a crowd. Timberlake proceeded to move through the crowd performing \\"Rock Your Body\\" with a troupe of female backup dancers, abruptly stopping short of the end of the song and shifting to \\"Se√±orita\\" on a small stage with his backing dancers. Upon reaching the main stage, he performed a number of songs, including \\"SexyBack\\", \\"My Love\\", and \\"Cry Me a River\\", which featured a dance break mid- field. Upon reaching the next stage, Timberlake performed his hit song \\"Suit & Tie\\" as the University of Minnesota Marching Band, wearing black tuxedos, played backup instrumentals and marched out to meet him. Timberlake proceeded to walk up to a white grand piano while performing \\"Until the End of Time\\", then segued into \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" as a tribute to Minneapolis-native Prince. A video of Prince performing the song played in the background, projected onto on a large multi-story sheet. An aerial shot showed downtown Minneapolis covered in purple lighting that morphed into Prince's trademark Love Symbol, with the stadium at the center. He then returned to the main stage to perform \\"Mirrors\\", as hundreds of dancers and members of the marching band performed choreography with large mirrors, creating bright reflections in the broadcast and across the roof of the stadium. Timberlake closed the show with \\"Can't Stop the Feeling!\\", entering the stands at the conclusion of the song. For the first time since the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in Indianapolis in 2012, no pyrotechnics were used throughout the performance. The show relied mostly on lasers and video screens for visual effects. Background The field being set up for Timberlake's performance In July 2017, Britney Spears was rumored to be the headliner, but Pepsi quickly denied it. During August and September 2017, several publications informed that Timberlake was the frontrunner to performer at the Super Bowl LII halftime, first along with his frequent- collaborator Jay-Z as co-headliner, and then as the solo performer. Jay-Z was also rumored to be a solo performer, but it was reported that he turned it down due to the NFL's treatment of Colin Kapernick, which he later confirmed in his song Apeshit. A spokesperson from the NFL stated at the time, \\"along with Pepsi, we know that we will put on a spectacular show. When it is time to announce her name we will do it. Or his name. Or their names.\\" The NFL confirmed the announcement on October 22 with a video starring Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon. This was Timberlake's third appearance in a Super Bowl halftime show. As a member of NSYNC, Timberlake appeared in the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show (2001), and as a guest artist in the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show (2004), which performance featured a controversial incident where Timberlake accidentally exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts on national television, described as a wardrobe malfunction. The Parents Television Council penned an open letter to Timberlake asking to keep the performance \\"family-friendly.\\" While the organization acknowledged that Timberlake apologized for the 2004 incident, they asked him to stay true to his word, saying \\"we are heartened by your response that the events of 2004 are not going to happen in 2018,\\" as the singer stated in a prior interview that \\"we are not going to do that again.\\" In an interview with Billboard, Pepsi executives expressed: The Halftime Show included a remembrance for Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson, who died just hours before Super Bowl LII after being struck by a vehicle. Development The U.S. Bank Stadium, where Super Bowl and the halftime show was held. During the performance, Timberlake wore an outfit designed by Stella McCartney, which consists of \\"alter nappa fringed jacket with a shirt, featuring a landscape artwork by British artist Martin Ridley,\\" according to a press release. Also part of the look is a Prince of Wales-check and camouflage splatter-print suit and matching jacket. As usual for McCartney, these pieces were made from animal-free leather and organic cotton. Timberlake stated in a press conference that there would be no guest musicians in the halftime show and that the event would focus solely on himself and his backing band, the Tennessee Kids. Regarding the Prince tribute, the performance's creative visual lead, Fireplay's Nick Whitehouse, told Rolling Stone: Prince had previously stated he did not want to be included in new music after death in a 1998 interview, citing The Beatles' \\"Free as a Bird\\" as an example of a practice he considered to be \\"demonic.\\" His family granted permission to use Prince's likeness on the condition that it not be used in a hologram, and they approved of the final result. Sheila E, a former bandmate of Prince's who was involved in negotiations over the use of his likeness, stated that \\"a bigger company\\" (she declined to specify whether it was Pepsi or the NFL) had insisted on including the Prince apparition and that the notion was not originally Timberlake's idea. Despite the lack of an individual guest artist, the more than 300-member University of Minnesota Marching Band was featured in the show. The band's drumline, brass, and saxophone sections pre-recorded and performed with Timberlake during his performance of \\"Suit & Tie.\\" The upper woodwind and auxiliary sections led drill formations and held large mirrors during Timberlake's performance of his song \\"Mirrors\\", and acted as fans and dancers throughout other portions of the show, including the club scene at the show's opening. All members of the band were featured on the field in the show's finale, \\"Can't Stop the Feeling!\\". The band had previously performed in the halftime show of Super Bowl XXVI. Critical response The Stadium and the city of Minneapolis were shown to be lit purple during Timberlake's tribute to Prince Timberlake's performance received mixed reviews. In a positive review, Bruce R. Miller of Sioux City Journal wrote \\"Timberlake is a masterful live performer ‚Äì which made Sunday's Super Bowl performance about the only sure bet,\\" he continued commenting the performer \\"did a lot of infectious dancing and managed to play with the crowd like no other.\\" Although it did not have a moment that \\"stuck,\\" he considered the Prince tribute the best moment of the show. In a similarly positive review, Taylor Weatherby of Billboard said \\"there is no denying that Timberlake absolutely rocked his first headlining [halftime]\\", further adding \\"Timberlake's halftime show was undeniably mesmerizing. From starting in the concourse to making his way into the crowd (and making #SelfieKid an instant superstar) for the ending.\\" She also considered it to be a \\"made for a TV experience\\" rather than for the public in the stadium, mainly for the sound quality difficulties, but also criticized him for including Rock Your Body in the set list. From the same magazine, Nina Braca wrote \\"his moves were on point,\\" and Andrew Ubterberger said two things were \\"relatively certain\\" about the performance. \\"most of America would love it, and most of the Internet would hate it,\\" and added Timberlake was \\"in a situation that was both a can't-lose and a can't-win. It would've been virtually impossible for him to please the critics he'd alienated over the last couple years.\\" Also from Billboard, Andrew Unterberge wrote, \\"Timberlake's audio was somewhat lacking throughout...but the choreography, live-band energy and song selection were all pretty impeccable\\". Chris Willman of Variety stated that, \\"Timberlake turned in a more enjoyably physical performance than just about anybody else who's done the Bowl show‚Ä¶ and if it was more a feat of athleticism than aestheticism, you can‚Äôt say that‚Äôs entirely inappropriate for the occasion.\\" Willman also wrote that the show, \\"wasn't one for the ages, but was impressive as a show of athleticism\\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that Timberlake's performance was, \\"heavy on dance spectacle, light on vocal authority\\". Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter called the show, \\"energetic, but also entirely lacking in live excitement.\\" Feinberg criticized the show for largely lacking spontaneity and live vocals. Feinberg wrote that Timberlake delivered, \\"one of the most over-planned, least surprising performances imaginable.\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly graded Timberlake's performance a \\"C\\", calling it, \\"dutiful, and empty\\". Franich faulted Timberlake for playing too safe with his performance. Similarly, Fran Guan of Vulture.com wrote, \\"Technically speaking, Timberlake‚Äôs set was a testament to precision\\". Guan, however, criticized Timberlake's performance from lacking in personality, and regarded his performance as unmemorable. The Guardian gave Timberlake 3 out of 5 stars, calling his performance forgettable but flashy. In an interview with NPR, Ann Powers said that \\"the entire performance was shrouded in the sense of Timberlake not being right for this moment ‚Äî and the Janet Jackson controversy haunted it.\\" Daniel D‚ÄôAddarrio of Time.com gave the performance a negative review, criticizing Timberlake for singing Cry Me A River in addition to Rock Your Body, calling the song's lyrics about an evil promiscuous woman out of step with the national mood, and said that the only message from Timberlake's performance was that he loves his back catalog Deadline felt \\"but you could see the motions more than you felt the music.\\" Chris Richards of The Washington Post regarded Timberlake's performance as, ‚Äúunambiguously underwhelming‚Äù. USA Today and Vulture compared Timberlake's performance unfavorably against Prince's own 2007 halftime show. Amanda Petrusich of The New Yorker wrote that Timberlake's decision to omit the end of \\"Rock Your Body\\" (which was performed during the controversial 2004 halftime) felt, ‚Äúless like an apology than yet more spineless deflection‚Äù. However, Andrew Unterberge of Billboard considered Timberlake's decision to cut the song short to be wise. Timberlake's Stella McCartney-designed outfit received negative reviews, with some critics regarding it as \\"tacky\\". The LA Times also gave a very critical review, one which also stated that Timberlake had nothing to say in his performance, and said that it lacked soul and meaning. At the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards, the Super Bowl halftime show received four nominations: Outstanding Directing For A Variety Special, Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction For A Variety Special, Outstanding Music Direction, Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video Control For A Limited Series, Movie Or Special. Commercial reception The Super Bowl LII halftime show was seen by 106.6 million television viewers in the United States, 9% less than Lady Gaga's in 2017. It had higher average viewership than the game itself, and the decline for the halftime show was roughly in line with that of the game as a whole, which had lost 7% compared to the previous year. According to initial sales reports from Nielsen Music, sales of the songs Timberlake performed during the halftime show gained 534% in the United States on February 4, the day of the Super Bowl, compared to Feb 3, while his streams on Spotify gained 214%.

This goal was met and exceeded by raising $14,401 from 262 backers. As of February 2015 none of these backers had received their reward without additional funds or arrangements above and beyond the original promises. This debacle resulted in many problems being brought to light such as the non-existence of any proper business title at the time of the game's inception or Kickstarter funding. Additionally there are still backers as of July 2017 who have yet to receive the backer rewards or refunds with the campaign creator starting lack of funds it means despite clearly selling copies of the game as documented on social media and regardless of many trips and additional personal purchases such as a European vacation.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1728508334/knock-down-barns-you- can-always-build-again/ Gameplay # Elevate the board by placing an upright foam \\"weapon\\" under each corner. # Place the divider across the center line of the board. # Each player must use 25 wooden blocks to build a single structure (a \\"barn\\") that is taller than the center divider. # Each player's barn must meet two additional conditions: all of its constituent blocks must be contiguously touching, and all blocks touching the surface of the board must be supporting the weight of a block placed above them. # The first player to complete the construction of his/her barn earns the right to shoot first. Once a player has declared his/her barn complete, no renovations can be made to the structure. # Both players must complete the construction of their respective barns before play begins. # Remove the divider from the center of the board. # The players take turns flicking their foam weapons at one another's barns. Flicked weapons must be in contact with the surface of the board at the moment they are flicked and must be flicked from behind the appropriate line on the playing field (see below). # Before a player shoots, he/she may remove from play, without penalty, as many blocks that are completely on his/her side of the center line as he/she wishes. Blocks that are on both sides of the center line are considered \\"bridges,\\" and may be removed by either player unless there is a block atop the bridge. # Players may not alter the position of the blocks in their own barn once play has begun, nor may they move any dislodged blocks on their opponent's side of the center line. # If a player accidentally or purposefully alters the position of one of his/her own blocks (a block on his/her side of the center line) before shooting, that block is immediately \\"sacrificed\\" and must be removed from the field of play. # If an opponent accidentally or purposefully moves one of his/her opponent's blocks (a block not on his/her side of the center line) before his/her barn is shot at, that moved block remains in play and the offending player loses a turn. # If an opponent's barn has at least one wall and a roof, it is considered \\"secure\\" and may only be shot at from behind the far line on one's own side of the board. # If an opponent's barn has at least one floor but no roof, it is considered \\"roofless\\" and may only be shot at from behind the center line on one's own side of the board. # If an opponent's blocks are all touching the board, the barn in question is considered to be \\"rubble\\" and may be shot at from anywhere on one's own side of the board. # The game's official instructions request that players shake hands after every match. # Definitions: \\"Secure\\" (a barn that has at least one block that is totally supported off the surface of the board by another block standing either on its long or short edge); \\"Roofless\\" (a barn that has at least one block that is totally supported off the surface of the board by another block lying flat on its side); \\"Rubble\\" (a barn with zero blocks supported off the surface of the board).

Standardised guidelines may be required to better match clinical practice with current literature.Inverarity, Laura; Grossman, K (28 November 2007). \\"Types of Physical Therapy\\". About.com. The New York Times Company. Retrieved 29 May 2008  Diseases and conditions treated  = Cystic fibrosis = Cystic fibrosis (CF), also known as mucoviscidosis, is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestines. Major advances over the past few years in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) have resulted in dramatic improvements in longevity and quality of life for many patients. However, respiratory dysfunction remains responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality associated with the disorder. Physiotherapy has long played an important role in the respiratory management of the disease, and has had to adapt to the changes in disease pattern from infancy to adulthood. The role of the physiotherapist is not limited to airway clearance, but also includes encouragement and advice regarding exercise, posture and mobility, inhalation therapy and, in the later stages of the disease process, non-invasive respiratory support. It is generally felt that the use of chest physiotherapy in CF has lacked good scientific basis, and the current call for evidence- based medicine requires physiotherapists to scrutinize their practice closely. = Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease = Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by chronically poor airflow. It typically worsens over time. The main symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and excessive mucus production.Vestbo, J√∏rgen (2013). \\"Definition and Overview\\". Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease. pp. 1‚Äì7. As COPD gets worse, shortness of breath worsens making eating, exercising or breathing much more difficult. = Deep vein thrombosis = Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or deep venous thrombosis, is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism.  Techniques  = Chest physiotherapy:Postural drainage = = Active cycle of breathing techniques = The active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) is a flexible regimen comprising breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises and the FET, frequently combined with gravity-assisted positioning. Increasing lung volumes during thoracic expansion allows air to get behind distal secretions via collateral ventilatory channels. During a forced expiratory manoeuvre, compression and narrowing occurs within the airways at a point dependent on lung volume (the equal pressure point). This is shifted distally as a forced expiration is continued to low lung volume, thereby mobilizing peripheral secretions. This technique has been reported to be an effective and efficient means of airway clearanceWilson GE, Baldwin AL, Walshaw MJ. \\"A comparison of traditional chest physiotherapy with the active cycle of breathing in patients with chronic supperative lung disease. Eur Respir J 1985; 8(S19):S171 with documented improvements in lung function and no detrimental effect on oxygen saturation. In comparative studies the ACBT has been found to be advantageous when compared with CCPT, Flutter, and PEP. When compared with the technique of autogenic drainage (AD) Miller et al., reported no differences in efficacy, although ACBT was associated with oxygen desaturation in some cases. There was, however, no significant overall difference in saturation between the two techniques. A more recent comparison of the Flutter and forced expiration with the ACBT reported no significant differences between the treatments for sputum weight, lung function tests or oxygen saturation.  Assessment tests  = 6 minute walk test = Pulmonary rehabilitation is an evidence-based intervention for the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In clinical practice, the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is commonly used to assess changes in functional exercise capacity in COPD patients following pulmonary rehabilitation with the primary outcome reported being the distance walked during the test (i.e. 6MWD). The 6MWD has demonstrated validity and reliability after one familiarisation test and the capacity to detect changes following pulmonary rehabilitation. In addition to assessing the outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation, 6MWD may be used to quantify the magnitude of a patient's disability, prescribe a walking programme, identify patients likely to benefit from a rollator and to identify the presence of exercise-induced hypoxemia.  Current concepts  Randomized trials have demonstrated that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) can improve dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and health-related quality of life. Rehabilitation has traditionally been provided in secondary care to patients with moderate to severe disease. However, current concepts are recommending that it should be delivered in a primary and community care setting for patients with milder disease. There are several opportunities for spreading the word for PR in primary care. One of these is to improve access to PR for all those disabled by their disease by the increase of community schemes. One such scheme being utilised in Canada is reviewed. The essential components of PR include behavior change, patient self-management and prescriptive exercise. In the last decade new strategies have been developed to enhance the effects of exercise training. An overview of these new approaches being an adjunct to exercise training is reviewed. Although the role of exercise training is well established, we are only just beginning to appreciate the importance of behavior change and patient self- management in contributing to improved health and diminished healthcare resource utilisation.

He is known for providing samples, service and upgrades for all Linn Electronics products after Linn went out of business in 1986. He also designed and manufactured the Forat F16 rack mount digital sampler and the Forat F9000: a debugged and improved version of the ill-fated Linn 9000 drum machine. Forat Music and Electronics Bruce Forat Forat Music and Electronics (also known as Forat Electronics or Forat Music) is a California-based corporation specializing in electronic musical instrument design, manufacturing, service, upgrades and customization, in particular, drum machines and digital samplers. =History= In 1982, Bruce Forat joined Linn Electronics as an electronics technician. When Linn went out of business in February 1986, brothers Bruce and Ben formed Forat Electronics Corporation in Studio City, California and purchased all of Linn's remaining assets. They hired some former Linn employees including Steve Alcorn, former Vice President of Engineering and Chief Operating Officer. Forat revamped the original Linn Electronics line, including the LM-1, LinnDrum, and LinnSequencer. They completely reinvented the ill-fated Linn 9000 drum machine and dubbed it the Forat F9000: the first fully functional integrated sampling / sequencing / MIDI work station. They produce software and hardware upgrades and modifications for the Linn 9000, Forat F9000, and the LinnSequencer and modifications, sounds and a MIDI Retrofit Kit for the LinnDrum. In 1987, Forat introduced the F16: the first 16 bit digital sampler tailored for drummers featuring MIDI capabilities, dynamic response to incoming trigger signals and, with a trigger response time of 0.1 milliseconds, the fastest audio-triggering digital sampler ever sold. Over the years, Forat has expanded into other aspects of electronic music technology. Today, they service, upgrade and customize most types of drum machines and many brands of vintage analog synthesizers. They're an authorized service center for Akai, Yamaha & Roland. They provide repairs and upgrades for the Akai line of hard disk recorders, samplers and the entire Akai MPC series of drum machines. They service Yamaha musical products including their line of digital consoles, drum machines and keyboards, the entire Roland line of products including MV series workstations and MC Groove samplers.
