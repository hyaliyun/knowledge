It is administered and owned by a civic society, Sociedad de Fomento Emilio Burgwardt. It has five plants, an operating theater, hospitalization beds and a medical guard. However, building infrastructure has deteriorated over the years, leading to several claims for it to be administered by the Province of Buenos Aires Ministry of Health. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Argentina's federal government performed a series of reforms in the hospital, aiming to reinforce the regional health system.  History  The hospital opened in 1956 as a smaller institution, created by citizens' initiative of a group of neighbors, which growth it from a small community health center to a full hospital. It was built upon a house which used to belong to the Lezcano family of that city. It soon became a reference medical center in the region, since it featured an operation theater, beds, and a permanent medical guard. In 2001, a mobile phone antenna was installed in the hospital rooftop. The hospital in 2016 In 2002, a 2-year-old boy named Fabricio Barrios died an hour after he was administered the MMR and Hepatitis B vaccines in the hospital. He couldn't be transferred to another hospital since there were no ambulances. His mother blamed the death on the Burgwardt Hospital, but according to the Buenos Aires Province Ministry of Health, the vaccines hadn't expired. That same day, other 25 children were vaccinated and had no issues. Then-Ministry of Health, Gin√©s Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a, believed the death was caused by malpractice, arguing the boy had probably been injected with something other than the actual vaccine. Then-President of the Argentine Society of Pediatricians also didn't believe the vaccine could have caused the death. The hospital administrator of the time, √Ångel Marrone, stated that the hospital didn't receive any government funds and that, when they heard of this boy's case, immediately requested ambulances from the Lomas de Zamora 6th Sanitary Region, the Lucio Mel√©ndez Hospital, and from a private ambulance company. The request was unanswered. As years passed, the building situation deteriorated, and provided services cut down. By 2014, the hospital was practically inactive and only the offices, rented to third party physicians, were operating. In 2014, the hospital was requested to dismantle the cell site, but then-administrator Norberto Paniagua refused to do so. The antenna was taken down on 2015, as neighbors had collected 1500 signatures demanding it. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Argentina's federal government stroke a deal with the civic society which runs the hospital to make a series of reforms, aiming to reinforce the regional health system.

He is professor emeritus at McMaster University and one of the founders of evidence-based medicine. Haynes has published more than 390 articles in peer reviewed journals and has authored/edited 14 books including Clinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine and Evidence-Based Medicine: How to Practice and Teach. His research interests include improving health care through knowledge translation and applying the findings of high-quality health-care research in clinical practice settings. He is involved with development and testing of evidence-based information products and services in clinical care. Haynes is an Officer of Order of Canada. His work has been acknowledged through awards, peer elections and honorary fellowships from national and international organizations. Major honors include a National Health Scientist Career Award from Health Canada, the American College of Physicians Rosenthal Award, Hypertension Canada George Fodor Award and Council of Biology Editors Award for Meritorious Achievement. He is fellow of Royal Society of Canada and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and an Honorary Fellow of American Medical Writers Association.  Education  Haynes completed his pre-medical studies from University of Calgary in 1967 and then enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine at University of Alberta until 1971. During this time, he was an MRC Summer Research Fellow in Physiology and Pharmacology and completed his BSc. Degree in 1969. In 1971, he was awarded a gold medal upon his completion of M.D. degree. He completed his M.Sc. and Ph.D. from McMaster University in 1973 and 1975 respectively. In 1977, he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada (internal medicine).  Career  Right after his Ph.D., Haynes was employed as a Senior Medical Resident at Toronto General Hospital in 1975. From 1977 till 1981, he taught at McMaster University as an Assistant Professor and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1981. During this time, he was associated with University of Toronto as a Visiting Health Scientist. Haynes taught as a Professor at McMaster University from 1985 till 2016 and then retired as Professor Emeritus. He also chaired the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at McMaster from 1998 till 2008. He is an inaugural member of the Cochrane Collaboration, a member of its first board; he started and led the Canadian Cochrane Center and Network.  Research and work  Haynes‚Äô research focuses on improving health care through knowledge translation, clinical epidemiology, application of the validated health care knowledge, development and testing of evidence based information products related to clinical care, randomized trials of medical and surgical procedures. He has also worked on patient compliance with therapeutic regimens. Haynes published an article in 1976 about improving patient compliance in hypertension. He assigned 38 hypertensive and medically non- compliant steel workers to either control or experimental groups and taught them to measure their blood pressures and create charts about their blood pressures. He also assigned the experimental group weekly visits from a non- professional high school graduate who reinforced regular pill taking behavior. As a result of this experiment, compliance of the control group decreased while it increased in the experimental group. In an article in 1979 about clinical measurements and detection of patient noncompliance, he stressed the importance of measuring patient compliance accurately in order to manage low patient compliance. He devised and evaluated methods of assessing a patient‚Äôs medical compliance and suggested against using a patient‚Äôs health beliefs, traits and perceptions as criteria for measurement of compliance. Haynes then shifted his research focus on documenting the problems of evidence handling by practitioners and proposing solutions. He wrote an article explaining the constraints faced by medical practitioners in handling research and clinical evidence. Haynes suggests the use of measurement principles and information tools to reduce the inaccuracy in the data gathering, interpretation, communication and application of the research evidence for patient care. Haynes worked on evidence retrieval from bibliographic databases and published over 50 articles on the theme of ‚ÄòDeveloping optimal search strategies for detecting clinically sound studies in MEDLINE‚Äô as well as EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycLIT. He aimed to design efficient search strategies and conducted a survey about the characteristics of search strategies for studies that would provide higher quality evidence for use by clinical practitioners (medicine, nursing, rehabilitation). He pioneered the use of machine learning to empirically determine the optimal search filters for various types of studies (eg, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, prognosis, causation, quality improvement and cost-effectiveness). His research validates the empirical search strategies for enhancing the retrieval of articles. After the documentation and retrieval of evidence, Haynes worked on synthesizing the evidence retrieved. He authored a review with his colleagues about the interventions to encourage people to follow medical prescriptions. He summarized the results collected from randomized controlled trials of interventions. The article concluded that there is a dire need for innovation in the methods to assist and encourage patients to follow the medical prescriptions. Haynes‚Äô research has resulted in structured abstracts of medical journal articles along with online search filters such as \\"Clinical Queries\\" which are often used by MEDLINE, EMBASE and other bibliographic databases. He created the Health Knowledge Refinery at McMaster University‚Äôs Health Information Research Unit which provides organizations, clinicians and medical textbook publishers and authors with current and most effective evidence for practice. His work on Evidence-Based Medicine has been critically acclaimed.

High food prices and serious food shortages have caused severe social and political unrest in many countries in Asia, Africa and South America. In order to ensure China's economic development, social stability, and political stability, in the 2008 National Food Security Mid- and Long-term Planning Outline, Chinese government put forward China‚Äôs grain strategy. Specific information of the strategy are: Persist in relying on the basic domestic guarantee of food supply; Increase government‚Äôs support; Perfect treble land carefully; Improve comprehensive grain production capacity leaning on scientific and technological progress; Improve grain regulation system; Strengthen macro-control over everything about the grain; Finally build a food security system that meets the requirements of the socialist market economy and meets our country's national conditions. The development of the Household responsibility system has motivated the enthusiasm of Chinese farmers for production, and greatly improved agricultural production efficiency and grain output at the same time. Since then, China has been able to grow most of the food it's daily need, and has initially achieved self-sufficiency in food production. In the late 1980s, however, due to the incomplete of procurement system‚Äôs reform and China's economic reform, China's grain production got stuck in stagnant. As economic developed, the scale of Chinese cities has been increasing correspondingly, accompanied with urban expansion. Under those pressure, food production are facing difficult situations. In order to protect arable land, the Chinese government has proposed the Red Line of Arable Land Policy. Despite administrative restrictions on the conversion of arable land, the area of arable land is still declining.

It is situated south-southeast of Mount Christie, and southeast of Mount Olympus. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Rustler Creek, which is a tributary of the Quinault River. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant as the summit rises 4,000 feet above the Rustler Creek valley in one mile. History The 1889‚Äì1890 Seattle Press Expedition originally named this geographical feature \\"Mount DeYoung\\", for M. H. de Young of the San Francisco Chronicle. The peak was later renamed in honor of U.S. Army Private Roy Muncaster (1892‚Äì1918), a forest ranger for the Olympic National Forest, who drowned 5 February 1918, when the troop transport SS Tuscania was torpedoed and sunk in World War I. The Muncaster Mountain name was officially adopted in 1918 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The first ascent of this peak was made in 1941 by T. Nelson of the United States Geological Survey. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Muncaster Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

Five new stations would be built along the new alignment. When service commences, the Green Line and Orange Line would route through the D2 Subway alignment, thereby alleviating pressure along DART's Pacific Avenue and Bryan Avenue corridor which all four lines currently share and promoting system-wide growth in total capacity. The project is estimated to cost between $1.7 and $1.9 billion. History Proposals for a second downtown light rail alignment date back to DART's 1983 Service Plan to accommodate the interlining of multiple future corridors in the DART Service Area. This plan laid the groundwork for a goal of three potential corridors with a goal that the initial development focus on an east to west subway rather than an at-grade transit-way mall if funding allowed. However, after a failed bond vote in June 1988, DART's System Plan was modified through the 1989 DART New Directions Transit System Plan leading to the development of an, at-grade, surface transit-way along Pacific Avenue and Bryan Avenues, which is currently utilized. Planning by DART specifically for the D2 Subway alignment were officially initiated in 2007. Description=Route The project would begin south of Victory station, diverting via a junction from the existing Green and Orange Line alignment, and traveling at-grade in a southeasterly direction within DART-owned right- of-way in the center of Museum Way crossing Victory Avenue, Victory Park Lane, and Houston Street. The alignment would continue through a parking lot directly south of the Northend Apartments and used by patrons and visitors of the Perot Museum of Nature and Science where the at-grade, Museum Way station, would be located. Upon leaving the station, the alignment would cross under Spur 366/Woodall Rodgers Freeway and after crossing McKinney Avenue, located on the other side of the highway, the alignment would begin its transition underground through the \\"west tunnel portal\\", passing under Hord Street near the Dallas World Aquarium and remaining underground until reaching Interstate 345. The alignment continues south under Griffin Street and between San Jacinto Avenue and Elm Street, an underground station, Metro Center station, would be located providing access for transfers to buses at DART's West Transfer Center or access to the Red and Blue Lines at West End and Akard stations. After crossing under Main Street, the alignment would turn east under the Belo Garden and continue under Commerce Street. While under Commerce Street, a second underground station, Commerce Street station, would be located between Akard Street and Ervay Street. Before passing under South Pearl Street, the alignment would begin to turn northeast, crossing diagonally underneath existing buildings and structures. A third underground station, CBD East station, located between Main Street and Elm Street would provide access for transfers to additional buses at DART's East Transfer Center. The alignment would continue traveling in a northeasterly direction and after passing under Cesar Chavez Boulevard, the alignment would begin the transition back to the surface at the \\"east tunnel portal\\" and emerge at-grade, crossing Hawkins Street just a block east of Interstate 345 and encounter a wye junction allowing trains to continue either in a northern or southern direction. The wye junction would be located at the current location of Deep Ellum station, requiring it to be relocated a block north. The new station would be renamed Live Oak station and be served by the Orange Line, solely, as it travels north past the wye junction and eventually converge on to the Red and Blue Line alignment. The Green Line would serve the Deep Ellum area with service at Baylor University Medical Center station and continue along its existing alignment. Station listing The project will include five new DART stations, two at-grade, and three underground, which will all contain center platforms and introduce fare barriers. From east to west, the stations are: *Museum Way, located southwest of the Perot Museum and north of Woodall Rodgers Freeway. The station will consist of side platforms. *Metro Center, located under North Griffin Street between San Jacinto and Elm Streets and would contain a mezzanine level, a public concourse level, and a center platform level accessible from up to four street-level entrances. A headhouse located at DART's West Transfer Center would be the primary entrance for passengers. *Commerce, located under Commerce Street near AT&T;‚Äôs headquarters, and the Magnolia and Adolphus hotels. The primary entrance for the station would consist of a headhouse at Pegasus Plaza located at the southeast corner of Main Street and Akard Street as well as access from two additional street-level entrances. *CBD East, located between Main and Elm streets just east of South Pearl Street. The primary entrance for the station would be a headhouse at Elm Street and South Pearl Street as well as access from an additional street-level entrance. *Live Oak, located in the median of Good Latimer Expressway, south of Live Oak Street. Service patterns The project would shift Green and Orange Lines service from the existing Pacific Avenue and Bryan Avenue transit mall to the D2 Subway corridor, maintaining their current terminals. The Red and Blue Lines would continue to operate on the existing transit mall. The system would continue to operate at 15-minute peak headways and 20-minute off-peak headways and with the same span of service from approximately 3:30 AM to 1:30 AM. Based on core capacity needs, an additional Red Line service would be added during peak hours from Cedars station to Parker Road station to address crowding. Services would continue to operate with two- or three-car length trains and not require an additional increases in fleet size beyond the current 163 Kinki Sharyo SLRV cars. Trains on the corridor would average 16 mph, with a maximum speed of 22 mph between Museum Way station and Metro Center station with 30 second average dwell times.

The newspaper was originally sponsored and supervised by the Kuomintang and is now by the Meizhou Municipal Committee of the CCP. History Meizhou Daily was inaugurated in November 1947, and its predecessor was the Upright Newspaper (Ê≠£Êä•), founded by the Upright Newspaper Agency of the KMT's Three Principles of the People Youth Group in Xinghua (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÂÖö‰∏âÊ∞ë‰∏ª‰πâÈùíÂπ¥Âõ¢ÂÖ¥ÂåñÂõ¢).

Background As a result of the victory at Pulkkila Sandels could commence operations to the south and harass the Russian supply lines. He first struck against a number of Russian transports heading for Raahe, south of Pulkkila, capturing two supply and one weapon transports, along with 100 Russians. Another transport column was captured northwest of Kuopio. Sandels then sent a vanguard of 150 men, under Karl Wilhelm Malm, to attack a Russian supply magazine at Kuopio where there was also an improvised field hospital. On their way they managed to surprise and destroy a Russian force of 150 men, sent out from Kuopio to retake the lost supplies; seven Russians were killed and 98 captured to no Swedish losses. Battle As Malm arrived in the vicinity of Kuopio on the 11th he was joined by approximately 300 peasants. However, only about 50 of them carried firearms, and so Malm thought it was best to have them encircling the town rather than following in the attack. On 12 May, at 2:00 AM, Malm split his infantry into three groups of 50 men each, after which he commenced the attack. The complete surprise, combined with the darkness and the lack of Russian command, shattered the Russian defense; they were met by stubborn resistance only in the chancellery, where a couple of Russians had taken up positions. By 6:00 AM the rest of the Russians surrendered; they had lost 40 killed and wounded and 160 captured, apart from a few civilians and 124 sick soldiers. Two officers and about 70 men had managed to escape despite the peasants encircling the town. The Swedes had lost two men killed and one wounded. The bulk of the Swedish force arrived at Kuopio on 20 May.

Situated on the south-west corner of Macleay Street and Orwell Street it was designed by Architect, Dudley Ward and built by S.D.C. Kennedy & Bird Pty. Ltd with building works completed in 1938. The building was sold in its entirety for ¬£80,000 in 1939. The spread of flats in the 1920s and 30s was one of the most marked developments in Sydney housing. Flat development was booming along with population and the area exhibited a concentration of Sydney buildings designed in the Art Deco style. Ward's influential designs for both this building and The Wroxton apartments (1936, Roslyn Gardens), looked to European experiments, picking up on innovations in public housing in Germany and Holland. The building consists of 7 floors and a basement. It is constructed in an Art Deco style from red textured brick. When completed the building consisted of 53 self contained flats, four penthouses, two professional suites and six shops facing Macleay Street and Orwell Streets. The building originally featured a number of open balconies on the Orwell Street facade, but many of these have been infilled over the years to provide more living space. The entry foyer and ground floor retains some original features such as a large hanging lantern (to match exterior bracket lanterns) along with sections of original walnut paneling.

The scientific studies on this technique are minimal in number and weak in conclusion, such that some chiropractic colleges and regulatory groups disallow their members from advertising the technique at all. Origin The Webster Technique first appeared in 1986 as developed by its namesake, Larry Webster, D.C. Webster was the founder of the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association (ICPA). This organization strives to \\"promote and defend\\" the use of chiropractic for children and pregnant women. The ICPA offers a \\"Diplomate in Chiropractic Pediatrics\\" as an additional certification to be earned after a Doctor of Chiropractic degree. This program consists of classroom learning and, same as a standard chiropractic college, the program \\"has no hospital affiliation and provides no hands-on clinical experience.\\" After Webster's death in 1997, Jeanne Ohm worked with Webster's widow to formalize a certification program specifically for the Webster Technique. This certification of proficiency can be attained after a 12 hour course. Method Advocates of the Webster Technique claim that it is ‚Äúa specific chiropractic adjustment to eliminate sacral subluxation and improve nerve system function in the pelvis‚Äù.\\" They suggest that these potential subluxations can lead to the baby being unable to properly rotate. Thus, the Webster Technique is meant to \\"open up\\" the pelvis and \\"provide space\\" for the baby to move and continue development. The technique itself consists of chiropractic adjustments to the lower back as well as abdominal massage. Regulations On 7 March 2016 the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists addressed the Webster Technique: According to the Australian Skeptics The Skeptic magazine's June 2020 issue, as of May 2020 there were still at least 51 Australian chiropractors who advertise the Webster Technique, despite having been previously reported to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. In British Columbia, the College of Chiropractors of B.C. has adjusted their policies on chiropractors making efficacy claims, specifically around pregnancy. They allowed their practitioners until 30 January 2020 to update their marketing materials or potentially face discipline. The college's website states they have They are no longer permitted to claim they can \\"move a fetus out of the breech position\\", \\"give a fetus more room to develop\\", or that they can \\"help pregnant women avoid birth by caesarean section\\", among other things. The college has updated the chiropractors' professional conduct handbook such that the Webster Technique may only be advertised as \\"a specific chiropractic sacral analysis and diversified adjustment for all weight-bearing individuals\\", with nothing specific to pregnancy mentioned.

Death  Taraikovsky died on 10 August in the capital Minsk, near Pushkinskaya metro station, during the 2020 Belarusian protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, being the first death since the protests started. Police reported that Taraikovsky died after an explosive device that he intended to throw at officers blew up in his hand. Demonstrators say that he was shot by the police, as protesters' accounts and video shot on the spot did not corroborate this. Another video was published on 15 August that shows the protester empty handed and getting shot by the policemen. On 14 August, the independent Belarusian media outlet Tut.by reported that Taraikovsky's death certificate listed the cause as massive bleeding from an open wound to the chest.  Calls for investigation  Rally in memory of Alexander Taraikovsky, Pushkinskaya metro station, Minsk, on 15 August 2020 His partner, Elena German, was able to visit the morgue and see his body four days after he died, and said that she did not believe the official version of his death. German declared that his only injury was to his chest and that his hands and feet were \\"completely intact\\" telling the Associated Press that she was sure that he was shot by the police and denying the official version that he died from a bomb. She detailed that the chest wound was like a seam with a hole sewn up and a black bruise. German has called on a Belarusian human rights organisation for help, and wants international experts to take part in an independent probe. She added that she saw no exit wound on Mr Taraikovsky‚Äôs back. She added that she had asked a police investigator to show her the bullet, believing that the bullet was stuck inside, but he refused the demand, raising her suspicion that Taraikovsky was killed by live ammunition. After his death, footage was published where Taraikovsky is shown with his hands to his body, as blood poured from his chest, before collapsing in front of a line of riot officers and lying motionless. After watching the footage, Elena German declared that it says new footage showed he was shot by police.  Aftermath  On 15 August thousands of Belarusians gathered to pay tribute to Taraikovsky where he died, on Pushkin Square, and laid flowers forming a pile.  Reactions  Journalist Vadim Shundalov decided to leave state-run Belarus Today after Taraikovsky's death, saying that they were not allowed to report about a video contradicting the official version of his death. On 16 August, interior minister Yury Karayeu later stepped back from the initial official version, acknowledging Taraikovsky might have been killed by a rubber bullet.

Modern advocates of homeopathy have proposed a concept of \\"water memory\\", according to which water \\"remembers\\" the substances mixed in it, and transmits the effect of those substances when consumed. This concept is inconsistent with the current understanding of matter, and water memory has never been demonstrated to have any detectable effect, biological or otherwise. James Randi and the 10:23 campaign groups have highlighted the lack of active ingredients in most homeopathic products by taking large 'overdoses'. None of the hundreds of demonstrators in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US were injured and \\"no one was cured of anything, either\\".Sam Jones, \\"Homeopathy protesters to take 'mass overdose' outside Boots\\", The Guardian, January 29, 2010 Outside of the alternative medicine community, scientists have long considered homeopathy a sham or a pseudoscience, and the mainstream medical community regards it as quackery. There is an overall absence of sound statistical evidence of therapeutic efficacy, which is consistent with the lack of any biologically plausible pharmacological agent or mechanism. Abstract concepts within theoretical physics have been invoked to suggest explanations of how or why preparations might work, including quantum entanglement, quantum nonlocality, the theory of relativity and chaos theory. Contrariwise, quantum superposition has been invoked to explain why homeopathy does not work in double-blind trials. However, the explanations are offered by nonspecialists within the field, and often include speculations that are incorrect in their application of the concepts and not supported by actual experiments. Several of the key concepts of homeopathy conflict with fundamental concepts of physics and chemistry. The use of quantum entanglement to explain homeopathy's purported effects is \\"patent nonsense\\", as entanglement is a delicate state that rarely lasts longer than a fraction of a second. While entanglement may result in certain aspects of individual subatomic particles acquiring linked quantum states, this does not mean the particles will mirror or duplicate each other, nor cause health-improving transformations.  Plausibility  The proposed mechanisms for homeopathy are precluded from having any effect by the laws of physics and physical chemistry. The extreme dilutions used in homeopathic preparations usually leave not one molecule of the original substance in the final product. A number of speculative mechanisms have been advanced to counter this, the most widely discussed being water memory, though this is now considered erroneous since short-range order in water only persists for about 1 picosecond. No evidence of stable clusters of water molecules was found when homeopathic preparations were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance, and many other physical experiments in homeopathy have been found to be of low methodological quality, which precludes any meaningful conclusion. Existence of a pharmacological effect in the absence of any true active ingredient is inconsistent with the law of mass action and the observed dose-response relationships characteristic of therapeutic drugs (whereas placebo effects are non-specific and unrelated to pharmacological activity). Homeopaths contend that their methods produce a therapeutically active preparation, selectively including only the intended substance, though critics note that any water will have been in contact with millions of different substances throughout its history, and homeopaths have not been able to account for a reason why only the selected homeopathic substance would be a special case in their process. For comparison, ISO 3696:1987 defines a standard for water used in laboratory analysis; this allows for a contaminant level of ten parts per billion, 4C in homeopathic notation. This water may not be kept in glass as contaminants will leach out into the water. Practitioners of homeopathy hold that higher dilutions‚Äïdescribed as being of higher potency‚Äïproduce stronger medicinal effects. This idea is also inconsistent with observed dose-response relationships, where effects are dependent on the concentration of the active ingredient in the body. This dose-response relationship has been confirmed in myriad experiments on organisms as diverse as nematodes, rats, and humans. Some homeopaths contend that the phenomenon of hormesis may support the idea of dilution increasing potency, but the dose-response relationship outside the zone of hormesis declines with dilution as normal, and nonlinear pharmacological effects do not provide any credible support for homeopathy. Physicist Robert L. Park, former executive director of the American Physical Society, is quoted as saying:\\"since the least amount of a substance in a solution is one molecule, a 30C solution would have to have at least one molecule of the original substance dissolved in a minimum of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [or 1060] molecules of water. This would require a container more than 30,000,000,000 times the size of the Earth.\\" Park is also quoted as saying that, \\"to expect to get even one molecule of the 'medicinal' substance allegedly present in 30X pills, it would be necessary to take some two billion of them, which would total about a thousand tons of lactose plus whatever impurities the lactose contained\\". The laws of chemistry state that there is a limit to the dilution that can be made without losing the original substance altogether. This limit, which is related to Avogadro's number, is roughly equal to homeopathic dilutions of 12C or 24X (1 part in 1024).For further discussion of homeopathic dilutions and the mathematics involved, see Homeopathic dilutions. Scientific tests run by both the BBC's Horizon and ABC's 20/20 programmes were unable to differentiate homeopathic dilutions from water, even when using tests suggested by homeopaths themselves. (transcript). In May 2018, the German skeptical organization GWUP issued an invitation to individuals and groups to respond to its challenge \\"to identify homeopathic preparations in high potency and to give a detailed description on how this can be achieved reproducibly.\\" The first participant to correctly identify selected homeopathic preparations under an agreed-upon protocol will receive ‚Ç¨50,000. Efficacy Old bottle of Hepar sulph made from calcium sulfide No individual homeopathic preparation has been unambiguously shown by research to be different from placebo. The methodological quality of the primary research was generally low, with such problems as weaknesses in study design and reporting, small sample size, and selection bias. Since better quality trials have become available, the evidence for efficacy of homeopathy preparations has diminished; the highest-quality trials indicate that the preparations themselves exert no intrinsic effect. A review conducted in 2010 of all the pertinent studies of \\"best evidence\\" produced by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that \\"the most reliable evidence ‚Äì that produced by Cochrane reviews ‚Äì fails to demonstrate that homeopathic medicines have effects beyond placebo.\\" Government level reviews Government-level reviews have been conducted in recent years by Switzerland (2005), the United Kingdom (2009), Australia (2015) and the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (2017). The Swiss programme for the evaluation of complementary medicine (PEK) resulted in the peer-reviewed Shang publication (see Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of efficacy) and a controversial competing analysis by homeopaths and advocates led by Gudrun Bornh√∂ft and Peter Matthiessen, which has misleadingly been presented as a Swiss government report by homeopathy proponents, a claim that has been repudiated by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. The Swiss Government terminated reimbursement, though it was subsequently reinstated after a political campaign and referendum for a further six-year trial period. The United Kingdom's House of Commons Science and Technology Committee sought written evidence and submissions from concerned parties, timeshighereducation.co.ukEvidence check: Homeopathy , House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, October 20, 2009, parliament.uk and, following a review of all submissions, concluded that there was no compelling evidence of effect other than placebo and recommended that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) should not allow homeopathic product labels to make medical claims, that homeopathic products should no longer be licensed by the MHRA, as they are not medicines, and that further clinical trials of homeopathy could not be justified. They recommended that funding of homeopathic hospitals should not continue, and NHS doctors should not refer patients to homeopaths.Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy, Fourth Report of Session 2009‚Äì10, House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, October 20, 2009, parliament.uk By February 2011 only one-third of primary care trusts still funded homeopathy and by 2012 no British universities offered homeopathy courses. In July 2017, as part of a plan to save ¬£200m a year by preventing the \\"misuse of scarce\\" funding, the NHS announced that it would no longer provide homeopathic medicines. A legal appeal by the British Homeopathic Association against the decision was rejected in June 2018. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council completed a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of homeopathic preparations in 2015, in which it concluded that \\"there were no health conditions for which there was reliable evidence that homeopathy was effective. No good-quality, well-designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than placebo, or caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment.\\" On September 20, 2017, the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC) published its official analysis and conclusion on the use of homeopathic products, finding a lack of evidence that homeopathic products are effective, and raising concerns about quality control. Publication bias and other methodological problems The fact that individual randomized controlled trials have given positive results is not in contradiction with an overall lack of statistical evidence of efficacy. A small proportion of randomized controlled trials inevitably provide false- positive outcomes due to the play of chance: a statistically significant positive outcome is commonly adjudicated when the probability of it being due to chance rather than a real effect is no more than 5%‚Äïa level at which about 1 in 20 tests can be expected to show a positive result in the absence of any therapeutic effect. Furthermore, trials of low methodological quality (i.e. ones that have been inappropriately designed, conducted or reported) are prone to give misleading results. In a systematic review of the methodological quality of randomized trials in three branches of alternative medicine, Linde et al. highlighted major weaknesses in the homeopathy sector, including poor randomization. A separate 2001 systematic review that assessed the quality of clinical trials of homeopathy found that such trials were generally of lower quality than trials of conventional medicine. A related issue is publication bias: researchers are more likely to submit trials that report a positive finding for publication, and journals prefer to publish positive results. Publication bias has been particularly marked in alternative medicine journals, where few of the published articles (just 5% during the year 2000) tend to report null results. Regarding the way in which homeopathy is represented in the medical literature, a systematic review found signs of bias in the publications of clinical trials (towards negative representation in mainstream medical journals, and vice versa in alternative medicine journals), but not in reviews. Positive results are much more likely to be false if the prior probability of the claim under test is low. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of efficacy Both meta-analyses, which statistically combine the results of several randomized controlled trials, and other systematic reviews of the literature are essential tools to summarize evidence of therapeutic efficacy. Early systematic reviews and meta-analyses of trials evaluating the efficacy of homeopathic preparations in comparison with placebo more often tended to generate positive results, but appeared unconvincing overall. In particular, reports of three large meta-analyses warned readers that firm conclusions could not be reached, largely due to methodological flaws in the primary studies and the difficulty in controlling for publication bias. The positive finding of one of the most prominent of the early meta- analyses, published in The Lancet in 1997 by Linde et al., was later reframed by the same research team, who wrote: > The evidence of bias [in the primary studies] weakens the findings of our > original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, a > considerable number of new homeopathy trials have been published. The fact > that a number of the new high-quality trials ... have negative results, and > a recent update of our review for the most \\"original\\" subtype of homeopathy > (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that > more rigorous trials have less-promising results. It seems, therefore, > likely that our meta-analysis at least overestimated the effects of > homeopathic treatments. Subsequent work by John Ioannidis and others has shown that for treatments with no prior plausibility, the chances of a positive result being a false positive are much higher, and that any result not consistent with the null hypothesis should be assumed to be a false positive. A systematic review of the available systematic reviews confirmed in 2002 that higher-quality trials tended to have less positive results, and found no convincing evidence that any homeopathic preparation exerts clinical effects different from placebo. In 2005, The Lancet medical journal published a meta-analysis of 110 placebo- controlled homeopathy trials and 110 matched medical trials based upon the Swiss government's Programme for Evaluating Complementary Medicine, or PEK. The study concluded that its findings were \\"compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are placebo effects\\". This was accompanied by an editorial pronouncing \\"The end of homoeopathy\\". A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that the most reliable evidence did not support the effectiveness of non-individualized homeopathy. The authors noted that \\"the quality of the body of evidence is low.\\" Other meta-analyses include homeopathic treatments to reduce cancer therapy side-effects following radiotherapy and chemotherapy, allergic rhinitis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and childhood diarrhoea, adenoid vegetation, asthma, upper respiratory tract infection in children, insomnia, fibromyalgia, psychiatric conditions and Cochrane Library systematic reviews of homeopathic treatments for asthma, dementia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, induction of labour, upper respiratory tract infections in children, and irritable bowel syndrome. Other reviews covered osteoarthritis, migraines, postoperative ecchymosis and edema, delayed-onset muscle soreness, preventing postpartum haemorrhage, or eczema and other dermatological conditions. Some clinical trials have tested individualized homeopathy, and there have been reviews of this, specifically. A 1998 review found 32 trials that met their inclusion criteria, 19 of which were placebo-controlled and provided enough data for meta-analysis. These 19 studies showed a pooled odds ratio of 1.17 to 2.23 in favour of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded that \\"the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies.\\" Jay Shelton, author of a book on homeopathy, has stated that the claim assumes without evidence that classical, individualized homeopathy works better than nonclassical variations. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that individualized homeopathic remedies may be slightly more effective than placebos, though the authors noted that their findings were based on low- or unclear-quality evidence. The same research team later reported that taking into account model validity did not significantly affect this conclusion. The results of reviews are generally negative or only weakly positive, and reviewers consistently report the poor quality of trials. The finding of Linde et al. that more rigorous studies produce less positive results is supported in several and contradicted by none. Statements by major medical organizations A homeopathic preparation made from potassium dichromate, a chemical compound well known for its toxic and carcinogenic properties Health organizations such as the UK's National Health Service, the American Medical Association, the FASEB, and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, have issued statements of their conclusion that there is \\"no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition\\". In 2009, World Health Organization official Mario Raviglione criticized the use of homeopathy to treat tuberculosis; similarly, another WHO spokesperson argued there was no evidence homeopathy would be an effective treatment for diarrhoea. They warned against the use of homeopathy for serious conditions such as depression, HIV and malaria. The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology recommend that no one use homeopathic treatment for disease or as a preventive health measure., which cites These organizations report that no evidence exists that homeopathic treatment is effective, but that there is evidence that using these treatments produces harm and can bring indirect health risks by delaying conventional treatment. Explanations of perceived effects Science offers a variety of explanations for how homeopathy may appear to cure diseases or alleviate symptoms even though the preparations themselves are inert: * The placebo effect ‚Äì the intensive consultation process and expectations for the homeopathic preparations may cause the effect. * Therapeutic effect of the consultation ‚Äì the care, concern, and reassurance a patient experiences when opening up to a compassionate caregiver can have a positive effect on the patient's well-being. * Unassisted natural healing ‚Äì time and the body's ability to heal without assistance can eliminate many diseases of their own accord. * Unrecognized treatments ‚Äì an unrelated food, exercise, environmental agent, or treatment for a different ailment, may have occurred. * Regression towards the mean ‚Äì since many diseases or conditions are cyclical, symptoms vary over time and patients tend to seek care when discomfort is greatest; they may feel better anyway but because of the timing of the visit to the homeopath they attribute improvement to the preparation taken. * Non- homeopathic treatment ‚Äì patients may also receive standard medical care at the same time as homeopathic treatment, and the former is responsible for improvement. * Cessation of unpleasant treatment ‚Äì often homeopaths recommend patients stop getting medical treatment such as surgery or drugs, which can cause unpleasant side-effects; improvements are attributed to homeopathy when the actual cause is the cessation of the treatment causing side-effects in the first place, but the underlying disease remains untreated and still dangerous to the patient. Purported effects in other biological systems belladonna preparation. While some articles have suggested that homeopathic solutions of high dilution can have statistically significant effects on organic processes including the growth of grain, histamine release by leukocytes, and enzyme reactions, such evidence is disputed since attempts to replicate them have failed. A 2007 systematic review of high-dilution experiments found that none of the experiments with positive results could be reproduced by all investigators. In 1987, French immunologist Jacques Benveniste submitted a paper to the journal Nature while working at INSERM. The paper purported to have discovered that basophils, a type of white blood cell, released histamine when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E antibody. The journal editors, sceptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, Nature assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of Nature editor and physicist Sir John Maddox, American scientific fraud investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic James Randi. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were \\"statistically ill-controlled\\", \\"interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim\\", and concluded, \\"We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported.\\" Benveniste defended his results by comparing the inquiry to the Salem witch hunts and asserting that \\"It may be that all of us are wrong in good faith. This is no crime but science as usual and only the future knows.\\" James Randi stated that he doubted that there had been any conscious fraud, but that the researchers had allowed \\"wishful thinking\\" to influence their interpretation of the data. In 2001 and 2004, Madeleine Ennis published a number of studies that reported that homeopathic dilutions of histamine exerted an effect on the activity of basophils. In response to the first of these studies, Horizon aired a programme in which British scientists attempted to replicate Ennis' results; they were unable to do so. Ethics and safety The provision of homeopathic preparations has been described as unethical. Michael Baum, Professor Emeritus of Surgery and visiting Professor of Medical Humanities at University College London (UCL), has described homoeopathy as a \\"cruel deception\\". Edzard Ernst, the first Professor of Complementary Medicine in the United Kingdom and a former homeopathic practitioner,Memorandum submitted by Edzard Ernst HO 16 to the House of Lords has expressed his concerns about pharmacists who violate their ethical code by failing to provide customers with \\"necessary and relevant information\\" about the true nature of the homeopathic products they advertise and sell: : \\"My plea is simply for honesty. Let people buy what they want, but tell them the truth about what they are buying. These treatments are biologically implausible and the clinical tests have shown they don't do anything at all in human beings. The argument that this information is not relevant or important for customers is quite simply ridiculous.\\" Patients who choose to use homeopathy rather than evidence-based medicine risk missing timely diagnosis and effective treatment of serious conditions such as cancer. In 2013 the UK Advertising Standards Authority concluded that the Society of Homeopaths were targeting vulnerable ill people and discouraging the use of essential medical treatment while making misleading claims of efficacy for homeopathic products. In 2015 the Federal Court of Australia imposed penalties on a homeopathic company, Homeopathy Plus! Pty Ltd and its director, for making false or misleading statements about the efficacy of the whooping cough vaccine and homeopathic remedies as an alternative to the whooping cough vaccine, in breach of the Australian Consumer Law. Adverse effects Some homeopathic preparations involve poisons such as Belladonna, arsenic, and poison ivy, which are highly diluted in the homeopathic preparation. In rare cases, the original ingredients are present at detectable levels. This may be due to improper preparation or intentional low dilution. Serious adverse effects such as seizures and death have been reported or associated with some homeopathic preparations. On September 30, 2016 the FDA issued a safety alert to consumers warning against the use of homeopathic teething gels and tablets following reports of adverse events after their use. The agency recommended that parents discard these products and \\"seek advice from their health care professional for safe alternatives\\" to homeopathy for teething. The pharmacy CVS announced, also on September 30, that it was voluntarily withdrawing the products from sale and on October 11 Hyland's (the manufacturer) announced that it was discontinuing their teething medicine in the United States though the products remain on sale in Canada. On October 12, Buzzfeed reported that the regulator had \\"examined more than 400 reports of seizures, fever and vomiting, as well as 10 deaths\\" over a six-year period. The investigation (including analyses of the products) is still ongoing and the FDA does not know yet if the deaths and illnesses were caused by the products. However a previous FDA investigation in 2010, following adverse effects reported then, found that these same products were improperly diluted and contained \\"unsafe levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade\\" and that the reports of serious adverse events in children using this product were \\"consistent with belladonna toxicity\\". Instances of arsenic poisoning have occurred after use of arsenic-containing homeopathic preparations. Zicam Cold remedy Nasal Gel, which contains 2X (1:100) zinc gluconate, reportedly caused a small percentage of users to lose their sense of smell; 340 cases were settled out of court in 2006 for . In 2009, the FDA advised consumers to stop using three discontinued cold remedy Zicam products because it could cause permanent damage to users' sense of smell.Sources: * * Zicam was launched without a New Drug Application (NDA) under a provision in the FDA's Compliance Policy Guide called \\"Conditions under which homeopathic drugs may be marketed\\" (CPG 7132.15), but the FDA warned Matrixx Initiatives, its manufacturer, via a Warning Letter that this policy does not apply when there is a health risk to consumers. A 2000 review by homeopaths reported that homeopathic preparations are \\"unlikely to provoke severe adverse reactions\\". In 2012, a systematic review evaluating evidence of homeopathy's possible adverse effects concluded that \\"homeopathy has the potential to harm patients and consumers in both direct and indirect ways\\". One of the reviewers, Edzard Ernst, supplemented the article on his blog, writing: \\"I have said it often and I say it again: if used as an alternative to an effective cure, even the most 'harmless' treatment can become life- threatening.\\" A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that, in homeopathic clinical trials, adverse effects were reported among the patients who received homeopathy about as often as they were reported among patients who received placebo or conventional medicine. Lack of efficacy The lack of convincing scientific evidence supporting its efficacy and its use of preparations without active ingredients have led to characterizations as pseudoscience and quackery, or, in the words of a 1998 medical review, \\"placebo therapy at best and quackery at worst\\". The Russian Academy of Sciences considers homeopathy a \\"dangerous 'pseudoscience' that does not work\\", and \\"urges people to treat homeopathy 'on a par with magic. The Chief Medical Officer for England, Dame Sally Davies, has stated that homeopathic preparations are \\"rubbish\\" and do not serve as anything more than placebos. Jack Killen, acting deputy director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, says homeopathy \\"goes beyond current understanding of chemistry and physics\\". He adds: \\"There is, to my knowledge, no condition for which homeopathy has been proven to be an effective treatment.\\" Ben Goldacre says that homeopaths who misrepresent scientific evidence to a scientifically illiterate public, have \\"... walled themselves off from academic medicine, and critique has been all too often met with avoidance rather than argument\\". Homeopaths often prefer to ignore meta-analyses in favour of cherry picked positive results, such as by promoting a particular observational study (one which Goldacre describes as \\"little more than a customer-satisfaction survey\\") as if it were more informative than a series of randomized controlled trials. Referring specifically to homeopathy, the British House of Commons Science and Technology Committee has stated: The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the United States' National Institutes of Health states: Ben Goldacre noted that in the early days of homeopathy, when medicine was dogmatic and frequently worse than doing nothing, homeopathy at least failed to make matters worse: In lieu of standard medical treatment On clinical grounds, patients who choose to use homeopathy in preference to normal medicine risk missing timely diagnosis and effective treatment, thereby worsening the outcomes of serious conditions. Critics of homeopathy have cited individual cases of patients of homeopathy failing to receive proper treatment for diseases that could have been easily diagnosed and managed with conventional medicine and who have died as a result,Case of Baby Gloria, who died in 2002: * * and the \\"marketing practice\\" of criticizing and downplaying the effectiveness of mainstream medicine. Homeopaths claim that use of conventional medicines will \\"push the disease deeper\\" and cause more serious conditions, a process referred to as \\"suppression\\". Some homeopaths (particularly those who are non-physicians) advise their patients against immunization. Some homeopaths suggest that vaccines be replaced with homeopathic \\"nosodes\\", created from biological materials such as pus, diseased tissue, bacilli from sputum or (in the case of \\"bowel nosodes\\") faeces. While Hahnemann was opposed to such preparations, modern homeopaths often use them although there is no evidence to indicate they have any beneficial effects. Cases of homeopaths advising against the use of anti-malarial drugs have been identified. This puts visitors to the tropics who take this advice in severe danger, since homeopathic preparations are completely ineffective against the malaria parasite. Also, in one case in 2004, a homeopath instructed one of her patients to stop taking conventional medication for a heart condition, advising her on June 22, 2004 to \\"Stop ALL medications including homeopathic\\", advising her on or around August 20 that she no longer needed to take her heart medication, and adding on August 23, \\"She just cannot take ANY drugs ‚Äì I have suggested some homeopathic remedies ... I feel confident that if she follows the advice she will regain her health.\\" The patient was admitted to hospital the next day, and died eight days later, the final diagnosis being \\"acute heart failure due to treatment discontinuation\\". In 1978, Anthony Campbell, then a consultant physician at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticized statements by George Vithoulkas claiming that syphilis, when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the central nervous system, saying that \\"The unfortunate layman might well be misled by Vithoulkas' rhetoric into refusing orthodox treatment\\". Vithoulkas' claims echo the idea that treating a disease with external medication used to treat the symptoms would only drive it deeper into the body and conflict with scientific studies, which indicate that penicillin treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases. A 2006 review by W. Steven Pray of the College of Pharmacy at Southwestern Oklahoma State University recommends that pharmacy colleges include a required course in unproven medications and therapies, that ethical dilemmas inherent in recommending products lacking proven safety and efficacy data be discussed, and that students should be taught where unproven systems such as homeopathy depart from evidence-based medicine. In an article entitled \\"Should We Maintain an Open Mind about Homeopathy?\\" published in the American Journal of Medicine, Michael Baum and Edzard Ernstwriting to other physicianswrote that \\"Homeopathy is among the worst examples of faith-based medicine... These axioms [of homeopathy] are not only out of line with scientific facts but also directly opposed to them. If homeopathy is correct, much of physics, chemistry, and pharmacology must be incorrect...\\". In 2013, Mark Walport, the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser and head of the Government Office for Science, had this to say: \\"My view scientifically is absolutely clear: homoeopathy is nonsense, it is non-science. My advice to ministers is clear: that there is no science in homoeopathy. The most it can have is a placebo effect ‚Äì it is then a political decision whether they spend money on it or not.\\" His predecessor, John Beddington, referring to his views on homeopathy being \\"fundamentally ignored\\" by the Government, said: \\"The only one [view being ignored] I could think of was homoeopathy, which is mad. It has no underpinning of scientific basis. In fact, all the science points to the fact that it is not at all sensible. The clear evidence is saying this is wrong, but homoeopathy is still used on the NHS.\\" References Evidence and efficacy Category:Evidence Category:Medical controversies ","title":"Evidence and efficacy of homeopathy"},{"id":"65069956","text":"Helga Neuner (10 June 1940)Hesselbach (Figuren und Darsteller) is a German actress.

The 2021 season will see significant transition in the composition of the league, with the amalgamation of the North East Australian Football League into the VFL and resulting expansion interstate into New South Wales and Queensland. The league will also undergo some shifts as a result of the financial fall-out from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had seen the 2020 season cancelled; and, a transition in league rules to strengthen its position as a pathway between underage and professional leagues. League membership The final composition of the VFL in 2021 is yet to be known, but many changes to the organisation of the league have been announced, and significant changes to the competing clubs are expected. Amalgamation with the NEAFL The North East Australian Football League had served as the top state-level league in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland (and previously for the Northern Territory) since 2011. Throughout its existence, the NEAFL had accommodated the reserves teams of the states' four AFL clubs ‚Äì , , and ‚Äì and several stand-alone senior clubs from the regions. The NEAFL's utility as a development league and talent pathway had long suffered as a result of the substantial gap in standard between its weakest teams and players, its strongest teams and players, and AFL level ‚Äì gaps which had been far more pronounced than in the VFL. The AFL clubs had long been keen for a higher quality league for their reserves teams to contest, and the AFL had been keen to improve the senior development pathways. The high costs of running the NEAFL also became acutely problematic due to the massive financial losses suffered by the football industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. As was the case for the VFL, the 2020 NEAFL season was cancelled due to the pandemic. In August 2020, it was announced that the NEAFL would amalgamate into the VFL, with all of its clubs afforded the opportunity to join the VFL, over a transitional period in 2021 and 2022. This is expected to provide both the AFL clubs and the northeastern pathway clubs with a higher standard of competition, improving player development and senior pathways in the north east. The Sydney reserves, Greater Western Sydney reserves, Brisbane reserves and Gold Coast reserves have all been offered licences to join the league. The NEAFL's five stand alone senior clubs were all also invited, and licence offers have been sent to three: Gold Coast based Southport, Brisbane based Aspley and Sydney based Sydney University. The Canberra Demons and Brisbane based Redland both declined to join the merged competition. As of 13 October, licences are yet to be formally accepted. The travel costs for the AFL clubs' reserves teams will be covered by the AFL, and the stand-alone clubs will be required to cover their own travel costs. Consideration will be given to partitioning the league into geographical conferences to minimise the overall travel costs. Whether the competition will retain the VFL name following its expansion interstate is yet to be confirmed. Documents sent to clubs refer to the league by the working title 'VFL/East Coast second tier competition'. Changes to Victorian clubs The financial pressures of the pandemic resulted in many AFL clubs seeking lower-cost reserves affiliation options. A new, lowest-cost option will be made available to the AFL clubs, under which reserves players would be dispersed throughout the various VFL clubs rather than being affiliated to a single club. The only confirmed change for 2021 is that the affiliation between and the Northern Blues was terminated after eighteen seasons ‚Äì this had been announced in March 2020, prior to the cancellation of the 2020 season. This affiliation had been high cost for Carlton due to the large amount of money it had been investing in the club as a development pathway in the region. Carlton has been granted a licence to field its reserves team in the VFL from 2021. Furthermore, the administration of the Northern Blues ‚Äì which had initially announced that it would have to fold without Carlton's financial backing and was not included in the aborted plans for a shortened 2020 season ‚Äì worked successfully through the year to find a means to remain viable as a stand-alone senior club, and it has been granted a licence to the VFL in that capacity for the first time since 2002; it will return to its former Northern Bullants name, and to its tradtional red and white colours. Other notes No Tasmanian team was introduced to the league in 2021 as part of the expansion interstate. Although AFL Tasmania had gained a provisional licence in 2018 to re-establish a Tasmanian team in the VFL from 2021, plans for this were deferred during the pandemic. The governing bodies announced an intention to take deliberate moves to strengthen the VFL's utility as a pathway league, through which undrafted players from the underage systems could continue to develop and then be drafted into the AFL system. No formal announcements have been made about how this might occur, but it has been reported that age restrictions could be enforced, setting a certain quota of under-21 and under-23 players who must be included on each VFL club playing list. The under-age players would be allocated to clubs on a zoning basis, with each NAB League club and other under-19s system allocated to a specific VFL club or clubs, thus allowing for greater interchange and continuity. Annual grants from the AFL to the stand-alone VFL clubs, which had been introduced in 2000 when the AFL reserves first amalgamated with the VFL, were abandoned due to the financial pressures of the pandemic. The salary cap for the competition was also significantly reduced, from $380k to $200k, or $100k for AFL reserves teams or those with reserves affiliations.

Background After having captured a Russian transport and 100 men at Perho, on 8 June, the Swedish Major Otto von Fieandt was sent to Lintulaks, west of Kuopio, with about 600 men to observe the two-way intersection leading to Kokkola respectively Vaasa, to protect the vital Swedish supply lines; Johan August Sandels had been forced to abandon the town shortly after the Battle of Kuopio, before Barclay de Tolly's army in Savonia.  Swedish forces  *Tavastehus Infantry Regiment (2 companies) *Savolax Infantry Regiment (2 companies) *Savolax J√§ger Regiment (2 companies) *Nyland Dragoon Regiment (\\"a handful of men\\") *Finnish Artillery Regiment (2 light guns) In total: 600 men and 2 light guns Battle On 3 July Fieandt was attacked by 1,400 men under Jegor Vlastov (sent by de Tolly); he received the attack in a fully stretched- out battle line, with no reserve, while Vlastov left one battalion and all his cavalry as reserve. At 2:00 PM it started raining and as the battle slowly started to die out, Fieandt commenced an all out bayonet attack. The first Russian lines withdrew before the Swedish onslaught but were soon caught by the reserve, which threw the Swedes back and forced them to retreat towards Perho. A Swedish detachment managed to halt the Russians by some stream, which saved them from a total disaster. The Swedes had lost 141 men in the fighting, of which 24 killed, while the Russians had lost 143, including 19 captured. Aftermath As the Swedish field-marshal, Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor, received news of the defeat, he immediately dispatched two battalions from the √Öbo and Nyland Infantry Regiments to Fieandt, along with 2 guns and 20 dragoons ‚Äî increasing his force to 1,200 men ‚Äî to stop the Russians from going north, towards Kokkola, which would cut off the Swedish lines of operation. Fieandt took a renewed position behind kokonsaari mosse, 4 km northwest of Perho Church. The Russians had likewise received reinforcements and counted at least 3,100 men under Generalmajor Jankovitj; he advanced on the Swedes and the two sides met once again at the Battle of Kokonsaari, on 11 July.

Her works included a site-specific commission for the ceiling of the Mus√©e du Quai Branly in Paris, as well as appearing on an Australian postage stamp.  Personal life  Napurrula was born circa 1938 in Watulka, south of Kiwirrkurra in the East Gibson Desert, Western Australia. Her first journey out of the desert was in 1962 with the Northern Territory Welfare Branch patrol, when her son needed medical treatment at Papunya. She travelled with her son and her husband, Yala Yala Gibbs Tjungurrayi, back to Kiwirrkurra that year. The following year Napurrula and her family group returned, this time as part of a migration of the Pintupi people due to drought. Napurrula died on 11 November 2013 from kidney disease. Her sons Morris Gibson Tjapaltjarri (Mawitji) and Adam Gibbs Tjapaltjarri are painters, as well as her daughter Glenys Napaltjarri.  Career  It was through her husband, Yala Yala Gibbs Tjungurrayi's painting that Napurrula first began work as an artist, supporting the production of his work, alongside his two other wives. Tjungurrayi was a founder of the Papunya Tula Artists and was a proponent of the Tingari style of painting, which was popular in Pintupi men's painting in the 1990s. In the 1980s the family moved to live in Walungurru, a newly established settlement and it was here that Tjungurrayi's wives, including Napurrula, worked on his paintings.  Artistic style  In 1995, Napurrula joined the Kintore/Haasts Bluff women‚Äôs painting project, which was in its second year at that time. It was there that she developed her signature style of diachrome patterns, with occasional use of colour. She formally joined the Papunya Tula company in 1996. Napurrula, along with other women artists, revitalised the company with their work, after the death of many of the male artists in the preceding years. After her husband's death in 1998, the volume of paintings she produced increased. Her style is reminiscent of some of Tjungurrayi's work, but her subject - women's lives and experiences and their role in mythology ‚Äì differs. Comparisons have been drawn between her work and that of other Papunya Tula artists, such as Makinti Napanangka and Inyuwa Nampitjinpa. Her status not just as an artist, but as a guardian of cultural heritage meant she was highly regarded in her community and beyond in her lifetime. The palette she used and the way the paint is layered on the canvas is seen as reminiscent of how body paint is used by women in ceremonial activities. Early works examined a range of subjects, but later in her career much of Napurrula's work focussed on the rockhole site of Wirrulnga, which was closely associated with birth and women's lives. During her lifetime, Napurrula donated works to set-up and support the Western Desert Dialysis program. The program made dialysis available to remote communities through a purple lorry, which travelled between them; Napurrula's work featured on one side of it. At the end of her life she benefited from the treatment the program she had supported could provide.  Exhibitions  Napurrula's work was exhibited in several group shows in 1999 in Sydney, Melbourne and Darwin. Her first solo exhibition was at William Mora Aboriginal Art in 2000. In 2015 her work featured in a joint exhibition in Singapore, alongside the work of Nanyuma Napagati. Her work has been exhibited in dozens of other exhibitions. In 2002, her work reached national prominence when it featured on an Australian postage stamp.  Collections  Napurrula's work is highly collectable and in 2007 and 2008 she was voted one of Australia's most collectable artists by Australian Art Collector Magazine. Her work is held by a number of significant galleries, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, where several works are part of the larger suite Tjukurrpa Palurukutu, Kutjupawana Palyantjanya ‚Äì same stories, a new way. Other collections include: National Gallery of Australia. = Mus√©e du Quai Branly = In 2006 Napurrula with three other female and four male artists were commissioned by the Mus√©e du Quai Branly in Paris to produce new works for its ceilings and roof. She saw this as the pinnacle of her career. Napurrual created a huge design on the first floor ceilings of the museum, based on the work Wirrulnga in the collection at the National Gallery of New South Wales.

The literal translation of the term is \\"Uneasiness of Creole people\\". Background Ethnographic research amongst Creoles in Mauritius has identified 4 main facets of the Malaise Cr√©ole phenomenon, in addition to the impact of colonialism and slavery: 1\\\\. It could be the result of dispossession and physical and psychological violence under slavery, especially as African slaves had to give up their traditions and religion to adopt their masters' religion Roman Catholicism in accordance with the Code Noir. This could explain the fragmented identity and lack of solidarity. 2\\\\. Another interpretation of Malaise Cr√©ole is that is a social pathology resulting from the lack of a fundamental pre-existing Creole identity. 3\\\\. The African heritage and hybridity of Creoles resulted in their destructive tendencies. 4\\\\. Lastly Malaise Cr√©ole could be considered as a concept which was deployed by political and socio-cultural groups in an attempt to homogenise the very diverse Creole community in order to mobilise them towards a common political goal. Manifestation of the phenomenon The 1999 Mauritian riots following the death in custody of popular \\"seggae\\" musician Joseph R√©ginald Topize brought the phenomenon of Malaise Cr√©ole to the forefront. Independent Enquiry and Recommendations In 2009 the government of Mauritius instigated the independent Truth and Justice Commission (TJC) to explore the impact of slavery and indentured servitude in Mauritius. It also investigated the dispossession of land and made recommendations for the welfare of descendants of slaves and indentured labourers. The TJC published its report in 2011.

Rear admiral ranks above rear admiral (lower half) and below vice admiral. Rear admiral is equivalent to the rank of major general. History In Sweden, the admiral's rank first appeared during the reign of Gustav I, who in 1522 gave it to Erik Fleming, a Council of the Realm. During Gustav's reign as king and throughout the latter part of the 16th century, the highest command of a fleet was led by a √∂versteamiral (\\"colonel admiral\\"), to whose assistant a underamiral was appointed. It was not until 1569 that a permanent √∂versteamiral was appointed; In 1602 the title was exchanged for riksamiral (\\"Admiral of the Realm\\"). The first permanent underamiral was appointed in 1575; his office ceased in 1619. Vice admiral is first mentioned in 1577. The admirals of the Swedish Navy have, incidentally, been as follows: generalamiral (\\"general admiral\\"), amiralgeneral (\\"admiral general\\"), storamiral (\\"grand admiral\\"), √∂veramiral, riksviceamiral (\\"Vice Admiral of the Realm\\"), amiralgenerall√∂jtnant (\\"admiral lieutenant general\\"), amirall√∂jtnant (\\"lieutenant admiral\\"), schoutbynacht and konteramiral (\\"rear admiral\\"). Rear admiral is equivalent to the rank of major general in the Swedish Army, the Swedish Air Force, the Swedish Coastal Artillery (until 2000) and as well as in the Swedish Amphibious Corps (from 2000). Historically, the Chief of the Naval Staff was often a rear admiral (or a major general in the Swedish Coastal Artillery) and the Chief of the Coastal Fleet. The Inspector (General) of the Navy (1998‚Äì2013) position was a flag officer with the rank of rear admiral. The current Chief of Navy (2014‚Äìpresent) position is a rear admiral. Following a proposal from the Swedish Armed Forces, the Government of Sweden decides on employment as a rear admiral. In everyday speech, rear admirals are addressed as admirals. Uniform=Shoulder mark The shoulder mark of a Swedish rear admiral contains a 45 mm galloon m/51 and two 25 mm star m/30 in silver embroidery on a white background: The center distance between the stars on the shoulder mark must be 27 mm.

Personal flags Admiral's command flag, which admirals of all ranks carry on ships, where they are as commanders. On a three-masted ship, a rear admiral's flag flies on the top of the mizzen-mast (admiral's flies on top of the main mast and vice admiral's on top of the fore-mast). The command flag of a rear admiral is a double swallowtailed Swedish flag. In the first blue field 2 five-pointed white stars beside each other (before 1972 by one in the same place). The flag of the rear admiral (and admiral and vice admiral) is flown on ships of the navy, from which officer of the rank now mentioned exercises his command, or on which he travels in the service, but not on ships on which he is in the capacity of exercise leader. A flag officer (for example rear admiral) who holds the position of Supreme Commander, Chief of Operations, Chief of Navy, Chief of Maritime Component Command or naval force commander, may carry an admiral flag on a car in which the commander in question travels in uniform. On airplanes/helicopters, rear admirals (flag officers) may carry a command sign in the form of an image of an admiral flag.

Following an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that Pueblo had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members, although the written apology was preceded by an oral statement by Woodward that it was done only to secure the release of the Pueblo crew. Woodward's statement was: The position of the United States Government with regard to the Pueblo, as consistently expressed in the negotiations at Panmunjom and in public, has been that the ship was not engaged in illegal activity, that there is no convincing evidence that the ship at any time intruded into the territorial waters claimed by North Korea, and that we could not apologize for actions which we did not believe took place. The document which I am going to sign was prepared by the North Koreans and is at variance with the above position, but my signature will not and cannot alter the facts.

Founded in 2016 by the music scholar and writer Stephanus Muller, the institute provides supervision to postgraduate fellows from a variety of disciplines and functions as an independent research hub in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Its mission is to create an institutional space for scholars and artists that encourages experimentation and risk taking. AOI's community include postgraduate and postdoctoral fellows, extraordinary professors, research associates, composers, performers, sonic residents, archival and heritage practitioners and international partners.  History  AOI represents an institutional development of a research-based archive project aimed at collecting and preserving the collections of South African musicians and music scholars: the Documentation Centre for Music (DOMUS) at Stellenbosch University founded and headed by Stephanus Muller from 2005 tot 2015. By 2015, DOMUS had acquired more than seventy collections that had served as a basis for articles in periodicals, conference papers, postgraduate theses, film screenings, recordings and performances. The archive thus played an important role in contributing to South African heritage and shaping debates on music in South Africa. Due to the scale of its acquisitions as well as institutional pressures, DOMUS was incorporated into a Special Collections Section of the Stellenbosch University Library and Information Services in 2015. A year later, Stephanus Muller founded AOI as a new, autonomous institute in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Stellenbosch University, continuing and extending the music research aspect of the original archive project. The founding of AOI and its research agenda were also informed by concerns expressed by the Open Stellenbosch student collective, and the broader FeesMustFall movement. These concerns related to the politics of exclusion in curricula and research and what was perceived to be the racist ideologies of apartheid South Africa still prevalent at institutions of higher learning. AOI marked 'an institutional reaction to the potentially rejuvenating, potentially destructive energy' of the student movements, and 'an effort to encourage thinking and creative work that could lead to stronger and better universities'. It is therefore significant that the institute was established as an independent organizational research unit outside the Music Department and Conservatoire at Stellenbosch University.  Projects  AOI has been funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (2016-2020) for a series of research projects entitled Delinking Encounters. These included an ambitious digitization project of music archives in the Documentation Centre for Music, a Sonic Residency programme, a critical edition project headed by Christine Lucia and focussed on the music of Michael Mosoeu Moerane, and an interdisciplinary forum for popular music studies, IFPOP. Mellon funding further enabled the creation of an online digital publication spaceherri,herri curated by the writer and film maker Aryan Kaganof. The institute is also host to the Hidden Years Music Archive, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, and is an institutional partner of the ‚ÄòCultural relations between Switzerland and South Africa (1948-1990)‚Äô project, located at the Bern University of the Arts in Switzerland. AOI has partnered with the University of York on the Newton Fellowship programme, entitled ‚ÄòSouth African Jazz Cultures and the Archive‚Äô. As a result of this partnership the institute supervised renowned jazz pianists Kyle Shepherd and Nduduzo Makhathini to become the first recipients of MMus-degrees in jazz studies in the history of Stellenbosch University. The institute is also the institutional partner for the Sterkfontein Composers Meeting, for which it has also received funding from the South African National Institute for Humanities and Social Sciences (NIHSS).

Creation  In 1943 March, the battalion began forming in the barracks of ≈Ωaliakalnis, which used to house in Kaunas. The Chief of Ordnungsdienst in Lithuania ordered that the newly-formed battalion should be formed from policemen of the Schuma and public police suitable for SS service. So, 54 soldiers from the 1st Schutzmannschaft (Schuma) Battalion (Bn.) were transferred to this battalion, as well as 69 of the Schuma Bn. 9 and 86 from Schuma Bn. 14, as well as policemen of the Public Police. Officers from other Lithuanian Schuma Battalions were also transferred: * 3 officers from the 1st Bn. (one designated to lead a company), * 3 officers from the 6th Bn., * 6 officers from the 9th Bn. (2 of which were designated to command companies) * and 3 officers from the 14th Bn. (one of which to command a company). It is known that at different times, the Battalion's companies were led by: * Lt. Albinas Molis (1st Company), * 1st Lt. () Justas Plevokas (3rd Company), * Lt. Soteras Vosylius, * Cpt. Voldemaras Langys (Langƒó?), * Cpt. Vladas Puod≈æi≈´nas, * Cpt. B. Armonas, * Lt. Vincas Lengvelis. It was foreseen that the battalion would consist of 715 officers and men.  Organisation  Structure of the Battalion: * Headquarters * 1st Company * 2nd Company * 3rd Company * 4th Company  Weaponry  The Schuma Battalion is supposed to have been armed with Russian weaponry.  History = 1943  In April 1943, the Schutzmannschaft Bn. 10 was sent to Novgorod Oblast near Lake Ilmen, where it fortified its positions next to the Volkhov river, which were previously occupied by the Spanish Blue Division. Next to the Lithuanian Battalion, there was a Latvian Police Battalion. Both units were subject to the 4. SS-Polizei- Panzergrenadier-Division. The Battalion sometimes fought with leading units of the Red Army and also raided the enemy's positions. In mid-1943, the Schuma Bn. 10 was renumbered to Schuman Bn. 256. During the seven months from April, five Lithuanian soldiers were killed in action: * Pvt. Antanas Vaikutis (1909-1943 04 16); * 2nd Lt. Gediminas Kazys Skardinskas (Skardys) (1916-1943 05 23); * Pvt. Domas Po¬≠≈æƒóla (1915-1943 06 06); * Pvt. Bronius Tvaskus (1920-1943 08 28); * Pvt. Vytautas Alilionis (1922-1943 09 04). On 21 November 1943, after public Lithuanian opposition to the formation of an SS Legion, the three Lithuanian Police battalions under SS control (5th, 10th and 13th) were transferred to the Wehrmacht.  1944  In February 1944, when the Soviet Army launched a successful offensive in the region of the Ilmen river, the Schuma Bn. 256 retreated to Ostrov in Pskov Oblast. In March, the Battalion was removed from Ostrov to Kaunas. For a short time, the Battalion was in the barracks of Auk≈°toji Panemunƒó in Kaunas, where the battalion rested after the fighting, while also being trained and strengthened with new soldiers. In May, the Schuma Bn. 256 was transported by train to Opochka, where the Bn. guarded the bridges and railway. During the summer of 1944, the Battalion partook in a large anti-partisan operation. The Lithuanians did not engage in fighting with partisans as they stood in a barrier at the edge of the forest. In September, the Battalions soldiers retreated by foot towards the Baltic Sea. The soldiers destination was Ziemupe town, in between LiepƒÅja and PƒÅvilosta, where it arrived in October. Here the soldiers guarded the Baltic Sea coast against Soviet landings. On 13 October 1944, the Red Army occupied Riga and from October 15, the fight for Courland was on. In Army Group Courland, there was in total three Lithuanian Schuma Battalions - the 5th, 13th and 256th.  1945  On 14 March 1945, the Battalion was ordered to march to the town of Kiburi, the HQ of the Army Group Courland. From here it was ordered to occupy a strip in the front line along the BƒÅrta river, where it remained until German capitulation. In the last two months of the war, the battalion fought with attacking Soviet troops.  After Capitulation  On 8 May 1945, majority of the Schuma Bn. 256, as well as the 5th and 13th Battalions, were taken prisoner of war (POW) and were sent to POW camps or filtration camps, where they were interrogated by the NKVD and later tried by war tribunals.  Attempts to escape  Some of the soldiers refused to surrender and attempted to escape to Lithuania and join the Lithuanian partisans or to be interned in Sweden. = ... to continue the fight against Bolshevism in Lithuania = Among those attempting to escape to Lithuania were Mjr. Jonas Sema≈°ka, Cpt. Pranas Mikelskas, Cpt. Stepas Janu≈°eviƒçius and others. = ... to the safety of Sweden = On 10 May 1945, a group of sixteen men attempted to swim to Gotland from PƒÅvilosta by a motor boat, where they were interned. Among the group, there were ten Lithuanians: * Mjr. Pranas Ambrazi≈´nas, * Cpt. Valdemaras Langys (Langƒó), * Lt. Vincas Lengvelis, * Lt. Justinas Plevokas, * Lt. Jonas Janƒçys, * Lt. Soteras Vosylius, * Battalion's doctor gydytojas Vincas Zenkeviƒçius, * Vir≈°ila Stasys Dranseika, * NCO Vacys Ingeleviƒçius, * Pvt. Pranas Pla≈°kys. On 25 January 1946, the Swedish extradited the Baltic soldiers. All of the interned Lithuanians were given over to USSR, except for Pranas Pla≈°kys. All of them were repressed and sent to Gulag. Even now, some of their fates are unknown.  Curiosities  In 1943, Cpl. () Bronius ≈Ωymantas made a wooden scale model of Yuriev monastery. When the same soldier was in Gulag, his talent was noticed by the chief, so Bronius ≈Ωymantas was exempted from heavy labour and instead had to make beautiful wooden furniture for those of the NKVD and their wives. On 19 April 1946, Bronius ≈Ωymantas was released from the Gulag after nearly a year when he was captured.  Commanders  From the formation to March 1945, the commander of the battalion was Capt. Jonas Matulis, transferred from Schutzmannschaft Battalion 14. In March 1945, Captain Pranas Ambrazi≈´nas was named commander of the 256th Schuma Bn. According to the interrogation protocol of Pranas Ambrazi≈´nas on 30th October 1950, he was awarded the rank of major and 2nd Class of the Iron Cross for his long service in the German Army and good organization of the battalion's retreat.

Opened in 1879 by the Great Eastern Railway as a competitor to Spitalfields Market in the City of London, the market closed in 1991 and consolidated at the New Spitalfields Market in Leyton. The site is now home to Stratford Market Depot.  History  Stratford Langthorne Abbey, a Cistercian monastic abbey was founded in 1135 on the site. The abbey survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538. In 1879, the Great Eastern Railway opened a new wholesale fruit and vegetable market at Stratford to rival Spitalfields Market, and the nearby railway station was renamed Stratford Market on 1 November 1880. To serve this market, a large goods depot was located south of the station on the western side of the railway line. Additionally, a coal depot served the Patent Victoria Stone Works. In 1907 the market depot became the centre for the distribution of bananas in London with Fyffes and Elders both having depots on the site. The railway depot closed in the 1960s although the sidings were used for storage of withdrawn rolling stock for a number of years afterwards. After 112 years, the wholesale market closed on 13 May 1991, moving to a new purpose built site in Leyton - New Spitalfields Market.  Today  The market buildings and sidings were demolished in 1992 to make way for the Stratford Market Jubilee line depot. To commemorate the former use of the site as a fruit and vegetable market, the new facility was named after the old market. Other areas of the site are in industrial and commercial use. The nearby railway station reopened as part of the Docklands Light Railway in 2011 as Stratford High Street.

After his arrest for killing Paula Leclair, the deaths of his wives were investigated, with him eventually admitting to killing both. For his crimes, Cleroux was sentenced to life imprisonment. Murders=Lise Roy Cleroux married 27-year-old Lise Roy, a divorcee with a young daughter, on July 4, 1987, and the pair would have a son later on. Their marriage was reportedly happy, but in April 1990, Lise found out that Camille had been molesting their 10-year-old daughter. The two engaged in a heated argument in the backyard of their home, during which Cleroux picked up a rock and bashed Roy's brains in. After he killed her, he dismembered the body, wrapped up the remains in butcher's paper and put them in garbage bags, which he hauled to a nearby park. He was seen doing this by a neighbor, but as the man was considered an eccentric, she thought nothing of it. Cleroux buried some of the remains, but later changed his mind, dragging the rest back to the family residence and burying them in the backyard. In order to make himself an alibi, Cleroux went to the police station, complaining that his wife had assaulted him and fled by bus to Montreal. An arrest warrant was issued for Roy, but she was never seen alive again, with the only clues to her purported whereabouts being Camille himself claiming to have sighted her on several occasions. The day after the murder, neighbors noticed that Cleroux had a brand new vegetable garden, unaware that he was growing tomatoes over his wife's burial site. At some point after the fact, Cleroux was served prison time for sexually assaulting a child. Jean Rock Cleroux and Rock, a troubled young woman suffering from seizures and had frequent spats with her family, met in June 1992, while Camille was working as a dishwasher at Mello's, a famous diner in Ottawa. The couple's relationship was described as stormy, with the two breaking up several times because of Cleroux's physically and emotionally abusive behavior. After finally making up her mind to leave him for good in the fall of 2003, Camille took her out on a walk through the woods in Fairlea Park, where he bashed her head in with a rock and buried her in a shallow grave. In order to cover his tracks, Cleroux devised a plan: he would pay $10 to a female acquaintance, who had similar handwriting to Jean, to write letters in her name to her family. In those letters, written and sent two-to-three times a year between 2004 and 2010, the forger claimed that Rock had left Camille behind and was now living with a trucker named Pierre. Over the course of the years, the forger made up a whole imaginary life for the deceased Rock on Cleroux's instructions, claiming that she had given birth to three sons, and even included photos of the purported children. Thanks to this deceit, she was never declared missing. In 2004, fearing that a construction crew was going to discover the shallow grave, Cleroux dug up Rock's remains and then reburied them in another part of the park. He would repeat the action again in 2006, when he noticed that animals had tried to take the bones, Camille put them in an onion mesh bag and pushed a shopping cart all the way to Albion Road on Bronson Avenue, where the Rideau Canal crossed. After weighing the bag with some stones, he threw it into the water. In October of that year, the remains were discovered when the canal was drained, but they remained unidentified until 2012. Paula Leclair By 2010, Cleroux was living at a highrise building in Heatherington, where he was neighbors with 64-year-old Paula Leclair. Camille was envious that the elderly woman's apartment had a much nicer view and was more spacious, and when she refused to let him move in, he decided to acquire it by force. On May 20, 2010, he asked Leclair to accompany him on walk to the Fairlea Woods, luring her to a shallow grave near the old trainyards he had prepared beforehand. After they reached the spot, he pulled out a knife taken from his workplace and stabbed Paula in the back, before picking up a rock and caving in her skull. After burying the body and taking her keys, Cleroux returned to the apartment, where he started packing up Leclair's stuff, which he later threw in a dumpster. When questioned about her whereabouts, he claimed that Paula had recently won the lottery and was on vacation to Walt Disney World in Florida, and after returning to Canada, she would move in with her son at his new apartment in Gatineau. Trial and imprisonment On May 29th, Paula's son, Andr√©, who hadn't heard from her in a while, decided to drop by at her apartment to check on Leclair. He opened the door using a spare key, but to his shock, he found that the place was full with another person's belongings. At that moment, Cleroux walked out from an elevator, cooly explaining to Andr√© that his mother had given him the place, and asked of the young man that he give back the spare key. Unconvinced by his explanation, Andr√© went to the police and informed them of the suspicious transaction. While the authorities were investigation, Camille attempted to put them off his trail, telling his forger to write a letter claiming to be Leclair, explaining that she had given the apartment to her neighbor willingly and to stop pestering him. In an attempt to convince them of the ownership, Cleroux met with Det. John Monette of the Ottawa Police Department to explain the situation. At the end of their two-hour interview, however, he admitted to killing Paula in cold blood. Cleroux was charged with the murder, and while investigating his past, authorities discovered that both of his wives had vanished in a suspicious manner. When pressed on the issue, Camille admitted that he had killed both of them. His old home was excavated on October 31, 2011, with some of Lise's remains found under the tomato garden, and others at Fairlea Park, but her skull was never recovered, presumed to be buried somewhere under the renovated Heatherington Park. Shortly after, the remains found in the Rideau Canal were positively identified as Rock's. At trial, Cleroux sat expresionless while the details of his horrid crimes were described in court. At one point, Jean Rock's father, John, suffered a stroke and had to be escorted out of the courtroom, muttering under his breath that he was going to kill that monster which took away his daughter and two other women. Cleroux plead guilty to all three murders, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a chance of parole after 25 years. During sentencing, Justice Lynn Ratushny said that he deserved nothing else than to be in custody for the rest of his life, with the families of the victims now being able to rest easy, knowing that their daughters' killer would never be released.

The regulation limiting the heads of Councils to hold office for more than two consequtive terms was abolished. Ammendments to the law, limiting participation of opposition parties activists, in case they had administrative record of conviction for , for example, participation in demonstrations or unauthorised protests and meetings, were adopted. Law on elections encomplexed the proces of candidades delegation, and deprived non-governmental organizations from right to delegate candidates to municipal elections, having, at the same time, provided workers' associations with such right.

It is the first part of a two-volume work, the other being Technica Curiosa, published in 1664. Publication Schott compiled his volumes from previously published and widely known works of authors, scholars and naturalists such as Conrad Gesner, Ulisse Aldrovandi, Joannes Jonstonus, Ambroise Par√©, Conrad Lycosthenes and many others, including many of the immensely popular illustrations of monsters and physical deformities. Schott summarized: ...what was either left out in the Magia and other works, was published later by learned men, or has only recently reached me. For his own research he extensively relied on the libraries and Jesuit universities of Europe. Like most natural history publications during the early stages of the Scientific revolution, the work is a curious conjunction between the beliefs and superstition of the time and pioneering scientific texts. The frontispiece was designed by Jacob von Sandrart. Between 500 and 1000 copies were printed in several editions by J. A. Endter & Son from N√ºrnberg. The Physica Curiosa represents a small, but critical step towards the adoption of scientific reasoning as the preferred method of scholarly work. From superstition to reason llustrations of Curiosities, Physica Curiosa The first six books, mainly aggregations of the writings of previous authors, are dedicated to magic, perceived oddities and miracles of the spiritual world. As mathematician and physicist Schott had developed a great interest in Otto von Guericke's work on air pressure and the vacuum pump. Both men would eventually correspond and cooperate as Schott immersed himself into extensive experiments and studies on his own and became accustomed to scientific work and observation based on reason. Thus, the second half of the Physica Curiosa is, although still full of misconceptions, an attempt to produce an account of observation of and reflection on real natural phenomena, marvels of real life, exotic animals and foreign lands. In his foreword Schott writes, that: other people have reported the wondrous things, that I am writing down here - yet they only tell. But I put most of it on the scales of truth and separate the true from the false, the real from the fake, and then I try to investigate the causes of the individual phenomena. Twelve books Books I to VI are a summary of all natural and supernatural monstrosities known at that time, including bizarre animals and physical abnormalities and abstract ideas of the mind. * I. Miracles of angels and demons * II. Miracles of visions (apparitions) * III. Wondrous things about people * IV. Wondrous things about the possessed * V. Wondrous things about monsters * VI. Wondrous things about freaks Books VII to XII concentrate on physical nature and phenomena. * VII. Wonders of animals in general * VIII. Wonders of land animals * IX. Miraculous things about birds * X. Miraculous things about aquatic animals * XI. Miraculous things about meteorites * XII. All sorts of wondrous things Impact Although he still makes some incorrect assumptions and false explanations associated with the natural world, his clear division within the encyclopedia suggests, that Schott was able to reasonably distinguish between fantasy phenomena and creatures and those found naturally. Summing up his view, he writes: I do not approve of all because I know that some are doubtful, if not false. Others are superstitious and perhaps even manifestly false. The Physica Curiosa alongside many other contemporary books of curiosities, that flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries, which contained a comprehensive body of text on fanciful beliefs of the past in a single publication, turned out to serve as an excellent subject of reference that made it easier for future enlightened scientists to pinpoint, address and argue against widespread, unscientific ideas.

Salm was the son of the distinguished Bahili general Qutayba ibn Muslim, who as governor of Khurasan conquered Transoxiana for the Umayyad Caliphate. According to al-Tabri, when Yusuf ibn Umar became governor of Iraq in 738, he considered making Salm governor of Khurasan, but Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik rejected his choice, and Nasr ibn Sayyar was appointed instead. During the civil war, he served as governor of Basra under Yazid ibn Umar ibn Hubayra. In September/October 749, as the forces of the Abbasid Revolution entered Iraq, the Abbasid commander al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba appointed Sufyan ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Yazid ibn al-Muhallab as governor over Basra and sent him to take over the city. Salm, aided by the troops of the Qays and Mudar at his disposal, confronted the advance guard under Sufyan's son Mu'awiyah, who was killed. Sufyan then abandoned his march on Basra. Salm retained control of the city until he received news of Yazid ibn Umar's death, whereupon he abandoned it. After the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate in 750, Salm served under Caliph al-Mansur as governor of Rayy and Basra. During the Alid revolt of 762‚Äì763 he served as governor of Rayy, and was asked by al-Mansur to come to assist in suppressing the uprising. In 763, he was appointed governor of Basra, keeping his post until his replacement by Muhammad ibn Sulayman ibn Ali during the next year (146 AH, 763/4 CE). He died in 766.

Producer William Sterling said Stewart wrote a \\"marvelous emotional study in his play.\\" The production was shot in Melbourne. Reception The TV critic from the Sydney Morning Herald thought the production was \\"chiefly remarkable for the briskness of its violence\\" listing the \\"five deaths by shooting, one by strangulation and one by public flogging. Even a hardworking Elizabethan playwright of the most bloodthirsty kind would have thought this a respectable tally.\\" He added \\"Stewart's principal characters were merely mouthpieces for a set of ethical attitudes. Because they were so obviously pieces on a moralistic chessboard and because their dialogue dealt in words like good and evil without once making these seem more than black and white abstractions, their predicament was almost totally unmoving.\\" He also felt producer (director) William Sterling \\"was busy enough with his properties and cameras...but he seemed actually to have encouraged the actors playing the prison commandant and the chaplain to emphasise the intrinsic hollowness of their dialogue.\\" However the performance of Sydney Conabere was praised.

Because it happened simultaneously when the Peru-Bolivian confederation was engaged in a parallel war against the Republic of Chile, in the so-called War of the Confederation, the first conflict referred here is often confused with the second. The war began on May 19, 1837 when the then in charge of managing foreign relations for the Argentine Confederation and governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, declared war directly on President Andres de Santa Cruz, both for the Question of Tarija and its support for the Unitarian Party. The operations began in August 1837 when Bolivian confederate troops invaded most of the Province of Jujuy, the Puna de Jujuy and the north of the Province of Salta. Continuing with a series of combats and skirmishes between both forces, all of them without conclusive results.Robert L. Scheina \\"Latin America's Wars: The age of the caudillo, 1791-1899 - The Peru Bolivian Confederation\\" p√°g. 136 In May and June 1838, the Confederate army defeated Rosas's troops in a series of encounters, the most important of which was the Combate de Montenegro or Combate de la Cuesta de Coyambuyo, which in practice led to the Argentine withdrawal from the war that from from then on he maintained a defensive posture, although the state of war continued until the victory of the Chilean-Peruvian restorative army at the Battle of Yungay, which put an end to the Peru-Bolivian Confederation. The question of the Unitarian Party Relations between the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and the Argentine Confederation had deteriorated, among other reasons due to Bolivian President Andr√©s de Santa Cruz's support for members of the Unitarian Party that carried out at least four incursions from southern Bolivia to the northern Argentine provinces in the years before the war. One of them was that of Colonel Javier L√≥pez in 1834, which culminated in his defeat in the Battle of Chifl√≥n. A new attempt by L√≥pez in 1835 was defeated at the Battle of Monte Grande, where he was shot. Also in 1835 Felipe Figueroa invaded the Province of Catamarca and in 1836 Mariano V√°zquez, counting Bolivian forces among his ranks, attacked towns in PunoLa Gazeta In August 1835, Argentine forces entered Bolivian territory to arrest Jos√© Antonio Reinaf√© and Cornelio Moyano, which exacerbated border tensions. Rosas suspected that Santa Cruz was using the Unitarians, in alliance with Uruguayan President Fructuoso Rivera, to seize the provinces of northwestern Argentina, since it had already done so in Peru. In September 1836, the Chilean confidential agent Francisco Javier Rosales showed Rosas documents in this regard, which confirmed the rumors that the unitary Juan Galo Lavalle was in negotiations with Santa Cruz to establish a state between Argentina and Bolivia.Historia general de las relaciones exteriores de la Rep√∫blica Argentina The possible Argentine-Chilean alliance Persuaded by the minister Diego Portales, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Prieto declared war on November 11, 1836, with the northern Peruvians opposed to Santa Cruz and its confederation. Portales communicated the declaration to Rosas and asked him to do the same by virtue of the tacit understanding between the two countries and reiterated the offer to sign an alliance treaty.La negociaci√≥n chileno-argentina por un tratado de alianza On December 28, 1836 Rosas wrote to the governor of Salta Felipe Heredia: because Bolivians only live on the tribute of the Indians and what the Cerro and Casa de Moneda de Potos√≠ produce (...) and the seizure of that Villa assures me that it is not a company of great difficulty (...) it owes us the millions of pesos that we have spent for their freedom and independence in the war against the Spaniards (‚Ä¶) and they owe us the Argentine blood that has been spilled in this war (‚Ä¶) Understand that, once Tarija has been restored, the Suypacha River will have to divide the territory of both republics ; But it seems to me that if we can ensure that the Villa de Tupiza and the town of Santiago de Cotagaita remain within our territory, it will be the best and most important thing to ensure peace and free trade between both States forever, with all the advantages that I have indicated. In exchange for doing this good I think we could forgive the expenses made in the War of Independence and also the benefits that they have taken from Tarija in all the time it has been usurped. But to obtain all these things it will be necessary to penetrate to the Capital of Bolivia, and have the Cerro de Potos√≠ for us. Such an important acquisition must be at work with the exclusion of the Salte√±os and Juje√±osRosas se encamina hacia la guerra On February 13, 1837, there was a border incident when a Bolivian party entered Argentine territory in the Cochinoca area in search of Colonel Jos√© C√°ceres, who was recruiting soldiers and they arrested him. On the same February 13, Rosas declared closed all commercial, epistolary, and other communication between the inhabitants of the Argentine Confederation and those of Peru and Bolivia, declaring anyone who crossed the border into those countries \\"traitor to the homeland\\", which generated warlike demonstrations in Buenos Aires the next day. Both confederations did not have formal diplomatic relations, so the declaration was intended to show the rupture of relations between the two countries. On February 21, Rosas communicated to Chile the bases on which the Argentine Confederation would sign an alliance: 1) The war would not be against the peoples of Peru and Bolivia, but rather against Santa Cruz, who would be forced to evacuate Peru; 2) Santa Cruz would not be allowed to remove armies or armaments from Peru and the Bolivian army should be reduced to maintaining internal order; 3) Tarija would be restored to Argentina, Chile would receive compensation for Freire's pronouncement, and Argentina for the expenses of the war of independence and the unitary incursions; 4) Bolivia and Peru should grant Argentina and Chile favorable trade conditions and adjust limits with them. Portales was upset by the delay in the declaration of war by Rosas and did not accept to include in the alliance the restitution of Tarija nor the compensation for the damages caused by the Unitarians from Bolivia,because the Government of Chile had not participated in these matters. Consequently, the treaty of alliance was suspended, but a de facto alliance was agreed, so that Rosas would declare war on Santa Cruz and not on the Peruvian states.Historia Argentina: Unitarios y federales (1826-1841). pp. 264-265. Volumen 4 de Historia Argentina. Autor: Jos√© Mar√≠a Rosa. Editor: Editorial Oriente, 1841 Development of the Conflict Although Argentina officially declared war in 1836, the military actions did not occur until 1837. On May 16, 1837, Rosas designated Alejandro Heredia as \\"General in Chief of the Confederate Argentine Army of Operations against the tyrant General Santa Cruz.\\" On May 19, 1837 Rosas declared that \\"the Argentine Confederation is at war with the government of Santa Cruz, and its supporters,\\" without waiting for the pronouncement of the other provinces. Santa Cruz had appointed Otto Philipp Braun as commander of operations in the south, seconded by Generals Francisco Burdett O'Connor, Sebasti√°n √Ågreda and Timoteo Ra√±a. Braun's barracks were established in Tupiza where an army that did not exceed 2,400 men was concentrated, almost all of them from Chiche√±os and Tarije√±os, distributed in the following units: 1st Battalion of ‚ÄúLa Guardia‚Äù, 5th line, 6th ‚ÄúSocabaya‚Äù, 8th of \\"Nationals\\", with 300, 380, 700 and 600 infantry men respectively; Regiment \\"Guides de la Guardia\\" and Regiment 2¬∫ de \\"Nacionales\\", both cavalry with a total of 4 squadrons, 2 of them hunters, 1 cuirassiers and 1 guides. The artillery had a brigade with 4 pieces under the command of Commander Garc√≠a. On 24 of June 1837 the Battle of Montenegro occurs, in the vicinity of Padcaya. Paz thad to withdraw to Argentine territory, being continually harassed by Bolivian troops. In this battle the Bolivians captured 20 Argentine officers.David Marley \\"Wars of the Americas: a chronology of armed conflict in the New World, 1492 to the present\\" End of the War Santa Cruz annexed to Bolivia the Argentine territory of the Puna de Jujuy in which the populations of Santa Catalina, Yavi, Santa Victoria, Cangrejillos, Pueso, Abra Pampa, Cochinoca, Pastos Chicos, and others are found. He placed it under the dependency of the Department of Tarija and appointed Bolivian authorities, among whom were Timoteo Ra√±a, Sebasti√°n Agreda and Bernardo Trigo. However, on January 20, 1839, the restorative forces of the Chilean Manuel Bulnes and the Peruvian Agust√≠n Gamarra achieved the victory of Yungay against Santa Cruz during the War of the Confederation, which put an end to the Peru-Bolivian Confederation. On February 14, 1839, General Velasco, the new president of Bolivia, informed the governor of Jujuy of the end of the state of war and showed himself willing to negotiate the problem of Tarija. On April 26, 1839, General Rosas officially put an end to the war without taking advantage of the defeat of Santa Cruz to advance on Tarija, allowing them to decide the issue. They remained on the Bolivian side. The territory of the Puna de Jujuy, Iruya and other occupied populations were returned by Bolivia in March 1839.

Reykjav√≠k 2004, p. 156-157 Eruptions under the Weichselian glaciers on Reykjanes Peninsula When stratigraphy is considered in detail, it tells about the different parts of this eruption: The eruption thawed the glacier ice and formed a subglacial lake in which the volcano continued to develop. The water very soon touched the magma within the vent and caused explosive activity. Tephra set down in layers into the subglacial lake. With time, the tephra built up a hill and small elongated mountain over the vent(s). When such an eruption is continued over a longer time span, the water in the end does not reach the vent(s) any more and lava begins to flow. In the top region of Keilir, there is a small cap of lava (area of lava cap 0,020 km2) which could mean that the volcanic mountain is a tuya (the lava being from subaerial eruptions at the end of the eruption series) or perhaps just represents a volcanic plug (the lava cooled and plugged up the vent). Ice thickness and more exact time of eruption in the case of Keilir are not known, just that it took place during the Pleistocene (Weichselian). Comparison to an Antarctic subglacial tuff cone Smellie and other scientists newly discovered a similar monogenetic subglacial tuff cone within the ice of Antarctica and could determine the thickness of ice which covered the vent during eruption. The Antarctic cone did lie under a polar ice sheet and not a temperate glacier as was the case with Keilir. Aditionally, the Antarctic cone is much older (around 640 000 years), whereas Keilir is up to 100 000 years old. And the tuff cone from Victoria Land, Antarctica, is placed next to known granitic plutonic complexes and seems to be a parasitic cone of a stratovolcano, whereas Keilir is located adjacent to presently active volcanic systems and looks as if it were placed on top of the shield volcano √ûr√°inskj√∂ldur, though the last one is younger than the subglacial formation. Interestingly, similar tectonics, rift zones, are behind both expressions of volcanism: the West Antarctic Rift System on the one handJ. L.

It is the 30th installment in the NHL game series and was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in October 2020. Gameplay The career mode for NHL 21, known as \\"Be a Pro\\", has been expanded to be more interactive and cinematic, similar to other franchises such as Madden NFL and NBA 2K. Players create their custom hockey player and choose to begin their career as a prospect in either the Canadian Hockey League or European hockey leagues, such as the Swedish Hockey League or Deutsche Eishockey Liga, or choose to go undrafted and sign to a team of their choice as a free agent in the National Hockey League. Players are able to select their dialogue when speaking to their coach or the hockey press in media scrums. The dialogue options the player selects affects their likability among teammates, management, and their brand. The Be a Pro central hub has also been updated to match the revamped mode, allowing for the player to access all important aspects of their hockey player in one screen. The multiplayer-based World of Chel umbrella mode includes four separate modes that were present in NHL 20; Ones, a three-way free-for-all mode; Threes Eliminator, an arcade-style 3v3 mode; Drop-ins, 3v3 or 6v6 matches composed of different individual players; and Clubs; 3v3 or 6v6 matches between clubs of players. A new progression system is introduced to World of Chel, which allows players to earn a rank in each of the four sub-modes separately. There are six ranks players can reach; Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Elite. The player's rank is reset at the end of each World of Chel season, and players are then given in-game rewards based on their ranks in each mode. The last few weeks of each season allows for clubs to participate in the Club Finals Championships, playing for a cup that corresponds to which division they are in; for example, a team in the highest division would play for the Elite Cup. Winners of cups are able to hang championship banners in their home arena and don championship patches on their jersey.

It is registered as a listed ensemble in the Bayerische Denkmalliste (Bavarian Historical buildings list).  Location  St.-Anna-Platz is located in the Munich district of Lehel north of Maximilianstra√üe. It extends from St.-Anna-Stra√üe to the east. On the east side, a short stretch of road connects the square with Triftstra√üe.  History  The square was created at the end of the 19th century within the construction of the new parish church of St. Anna. Previously, the Franciscan monastery with the Klosterkirche St. Anna im Lehel (monastery church), which had received a neo-Romanesque two-tower fa√ßade in 1852/53, stood here only in the west. The church was built from 1887 to 1892 according to plans by Gabriel von Seidl in neo-Romanesque style. Approximately parallel to this, the edge of the square was built on three sides by various architects in the neo- Renaissance style. In 1965/66 the fa√ßade of the monastery church was reconstructed in baroque style, whereby the original overall impression of the square was lost.  Picture of the square  Parish church St. Anna on the St. Anna square The St.-Anna-Platz has an approximately rectangular shape with a length of about 100 m and a width of about 75 m. It is slightly widened towards St.-Anna-Stra√üe. In the middle of the square, the neo-Romanesque parish church stands elevated on a terrace surrounded by a low enclosure wall. Opposite it on the other side of St.-Anna's-Stra√üe is the Franciscan monastery with the baroque fa√ßade of the monastery church. Part of the northern side of the square is occupied by the southern wing of St.-Anna's-Grammar School. The square has been rebuilt on three sides, only the west side on St.-Anna-Stra√üe is exposed. The row of houses on the south side (No. 1, 1a, 2, 3, 4) is completely preserved, the houses are listed as historical buildings. Of the remaining houses, only no. 9 in the north-east corner and the St.-Anna- Gymnasium have been preserved and are listed as historical buildings.

There are three songs known as High Germany. This page focuses on the best known one, the others being The Two Lovers or True Lovers (Roud 1445) and The Wars of Germany (Roud 5608). The song deals with a young man (usually named Willy) and his lover (Polly) lamenting over the his conscription to fight in Germany, \\"High Germany\\" referring to the southern, mountainous part of the country. He attempts to convince her to dress like a man and join him in the war. \\"Polly\\" professes her love, but declares she is not fit for war. \\"Willy\\" attempts to persuade her to change her mind, stating that he will buy her a horse to ride, and that they will eventually wed. \\"Polly\\" still refuses and laments that her man has been drafted away from her. The historical setting of the ballad is most likely either the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) or the Seven Years War (1756-1763). The first verse is usually as follows: : Oh Polly love, oh Polly, the rout has now begun. : We must go a-marching to the beating of the drum. : Dress yourself all in your best and come along with me. : I'll take you to the war, my love, in High Germany. Cecil Sharp collected a version in 1906, and successfully encouraged Gustav Holst to use the melody in A Somerset Rhapsody (1907). Ralph Vaughan Williams later used the melody in the third movement of his famous English Folk Song Suite (1923).  Field recordings  Countless versions of the ballad have been found, including numerous recordings, several of which are available online. The following examples are some which use variations of the famous tune. * 1908: Archer Lane of Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, recorded on phonograph by Percy Grainger * 1956: Phoebe Smith of Melton, Woodbridge, Suffolk, recorded by Peter Kennedy * 1968: Ethel Findlater of Dounby, Orkney, recorded by Alan J.

Cobb is best known for being the first woman physician in Indian Territory and quite possibly the first to practice medicine west of the Mississippi River. Early life and education Cobb was born near Morgantown, Tennessee and was the oldest of seven children of Joseph Benson and Evaline Clingman Cobb. She attended school in Cleveland, Tennessee until 1870, when at the age of 12, her family moved to Cooweescoowee District of the Cherokee Nation (near modern day Wagoner, Oklahoma). Cobb was a good student, winning awards while attending school in Tennessee. This furthered her hunger for education and laid the groundwork for her ability to excel in future studies after her family moved to Indian Territory. Shortly after arriving in the Cherokee Nation, her mother gave birth to Cobb's youngest sister. It was a very difficult delivery. The family had to call for a midwife because there were no doctors in the area at the time. Although her mother survived the delivery, it left a lasting impression on the young woman and became her motivation that would propel her into her career. There was a limited choice of schools in the Indian Territory at the time so Cobb enrolled in the Cherokee Female Seminary in Tahlequah, Oklahoma where she graduated in 1879. She continued her education at Glendale Female College in Glendale, Ohio where she graduated in 1881. At this point in her life, Cobb had received more education than most women of her day. Cobb returned to Indian Territory to teach at the Seminary from 1882 until it was destroyed by fire in 1887. She never forgot the lesson she learned from watching her mother struggle during childbirth and the need for doctors in her district; so she left the territory again and enrolled in the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1888. It was only the second institution in the world, at that time, to offer women a M.D. degree. Cobb earned her M.D. degree in 1892. Career After Cobb spent six months in an internship in New York at Staten Island Nursery and Child's hospital, she again returned home, in 1893, to begin her practice of medicine in the rural areas of Wagoner County. She worked out of a farmhouse on her family's homestead, barely seeing two hundred patients per year. She focused primarily on women and children. \\"Dr. Belle\\" as she was known, performed many surgeries inside the patient's home, traveling many miles in her horse-drawn buggy, and often refused to charge anything for her services. Retirement, personal life and death Isabel \\"Belle\\" Cobb, standing in the middle of the back row, became the first female doctor in Indian Territory, Oklahoma Cobb continued her practice until she fell and broke her hip in 1930. She retired soon after as her health deteriorated. Cobb never married, but she did adopt a six-year-old Italian orphan in 1895. She was a member of the Presbyterian church as well as many literary societies in Wagoner County. Cobb died from natural causes on August 11, 1947 in Wagoner and was laid to rest at Pioneer Memorial Cemetery. Posthumous recognition In 2015, students at Northeastern State University, which now sits on the land once occupied by the female and male Cherokee seminaries, voted to name the new student housing after Cobb. She received 43% of the 266 total votes cast. There is only one other building on campus named after a woman. Isabel Cobb Hall was dedicated in a ribbon cutting ceremony held September 19, 2016. On March 26, 2016, Mayor Albert Jones of Wagoner declared the day \\"Dr. Belle Cobb Day\\". There was an event at the Wagoner Historical Museum in which many of Cobb's relatives were in attendance. The declaration from the mayor read in part, \\"Today, we celebrate Dr. Belle Cobb and pay tribute to her outstanding leadership, perseverance and giving heart...the city of Wagoner honors and commemorates Dr. Cobb for making a definitive mark on history.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1858 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Cherokee people Category:Cherokee Nation (1794‚Äì1907) Category:American women physicians Category:Schoolteachers from Oklahoma Category:People from Wagoner County, Oklahoma Category:19th-century American educators Category:American women educators Category:Physicians from Oklahoma Category:Educators from Oklahoma Category:People from Loudon County, Tennessee Category:Educators from Tennessee Category:Physicians from Tennessee Category:Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania alumni Category:19th-century women educators ","title":"Isabel Cobb"},{"id":"65071561","text":"CraZanity is a thrill ride located at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Six Flags M√©xico.

The focus of her research is on human visual perception, specifically how brains create and stabilise colour so that people see colours, often in different ways. This makes use of physics, psychology and neurobiology and she has developed technologies and algorithms to investigate colour constancy and perception. Her research has been applied in several very different areas including some medical conditions, artwork and exhibitions and also quality control of food. Her research group has also studied differing colour preferences among young men and women. Hurlbert and colleagues participated in discussion about the science behind the 2015 social media event #the dress where people disagreed on whether it was black and royal blue, or white and gold in colour.

Known in Scottish Gaelic as Conchie Dhu or Condochy Doye, the clan is mainly associated with the confederation of Clan Chattan. History=Origins The original Gaelic name of this clan was Conchie Dhu or Condochy Doye. Originally the MacPhails had a stronghold until 1291 at Fassfern about 16 kilometers west of Fort William. With Clan Chattan The MacPhails were always considered to be of old Clan Chattan stock and closely related to Macphersons , Macbeans and other Cattanachs that together formed the Clan Chattan Federation. With Clan Macintosh When the Chief of Clan Mackintosh, Angus, married the heiress of Clan Chattan in the 13th Century, he moved Chattan families to eastern Inverness-shire. Since the 15th Century, Clan MacPhail was found mainly in the lands of Inverernie about 8 km west of Loch Moy, near the ancestral home of the MacIntosh‚Äôs. In 1490, a Donald MacPhail witnessed a bond between the lairds of Mackintosh and Kilravock and two years later betweeen Mackintosh and the Dunbars. This MacPhail is identified as a tenant of Dullatur according to the Exchequer Rolls of Scotland.Eyre-Todd, G. The Highland clans of Scotland, their history and traditions, 1862-1937 pg 334 In 1547, a MacPhail, Duncan Makconquhy Dow leased half the towns of Tullich and Elrick. This lease was inherited through generations. In 1631, another MacPhail entered into a long lease to Invernarnie with the Laird of Kilravock. For 1000 Pound Scots he was granted a wadset and long tack of Invernarnie, which faced the river Nairn and lay within the Barony of Strathnairn in the Parish of Daviot and Dunlichty. The land also included Duglass and Dullatur facing the river Findhorn. These lands were held by descendants until 1773, when the lease was not renewed. The unity of the family was destroyed and a large portion drifted southward to Argyllshire and where largely absorbed into urban life. A number of Clan Chattan bonds however signed through the 17th and 18th Centuries continued to have MacPhail signatures still indicating their stature in the Federation. Some of the Clan MacPhail chiefs included: * Duncan MakDonequhy Dow MacPhail in 1546 * Paul MacPhail in 1689 * Robert MacPhail in 1721 * Alexander MacPhail in 1743 These MacPhails are entitled to also wear the tartan of Clan MacIntosh due to their close fraternity. Tartan Clan MacPhail With Clan Cameron The remnants of Clan MacPhail that stayed in the west and did not migrate with Clan MackIntosh in the 13th Century, eventually integrated with Clan Cameron or migrated later down to Arygyll with Clan Campbell. Variations on the name found with Clan Cameron include: MacKail, MacKell, MacPhail, MacVail, MacVaaile, MacVaill, MacVale and Paul. With Clan Mackay A sept of the Clan Mackay by the surname of Polson who are also known as Siol Phail are, according to Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet, descended from Neil, son of Neil, son of Donald Mackay, 5th of Strathnaver, chief of Clan Mackay. Although one of their ancestors, Neil Neilson Mackay, died fighting against his own Strathnaver kinsmen at the Battle of Drumnacoub in 1433, the Polsons later gravitated back towards their Strathnaver kindred. In 1497, 1506 and 1511, Sir John Polson who was presbyter and later chanter of Caithness acted for Iye Roy Mackay, 10th of Strathnaver. At the Battle of Torran Du in 1517, the Polsons supported the Clan Mackay against the Murrays of Aberscross. In a list of men in Sutherland capable of carrying arms during the Jacobite rising of 1745, a number of Polsons appear in the parishes of Loth and Kildonan. However, according to historian Angus Mackay writing in 1906, the sept was no longer numerically strong and many of them had adopted the surname MacPhail or were now signing themselves as Mackay. Status Numerous MacPhail families migrated or were transported during the Highland Clearances to the colonies of America and Australia. The last lineal MacPhail chief, Paul MacPhail died in Australia in the early 1900s.The Celtic Monthly: A magazine for Highlanders, June 1912, No 6 vol XXJ Today MacPhails can track their origins from these four main migrations mainly showing fealty to larger clans in those regions: # With Clan Chattan Federation but with their own chief and allied to Clan Mackintosh. # With Clan Cameron from the 16th century forward. # With Clan Mackay in the north of Scotland. # Around Argyll and not associated.

Towards the end of the Soviet era, he began winning the open sections at international tournaments. In 1991, when the Soviet Union dissolved, Sher became a Russian citizen. In 1997, Sher, his wife, Woman Grandmaster Alla Grinfeld (ru), and their son, Mikhail, who then was 14, emigrated to America and settled in Brooklyn. Sher went on to become a distinguished scholastic chess coach and clinician in New York and was instrumental in developing several internationally strong players, notably GM Fabiano Caruana, many times number two in the world, and Robert Hess, who at age , while attending Stuyvesant High School, became an international master and at , a grandmaster. Before immigrating, Sher had coached GM Peter Heine Nielsen.  Career  Sher was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, and completed his bachelor's degree at Chernivtsi University. He went on to grad school at the State Central Order of Lenin Institute of Physical Education in Moscow; and, in 1975, in addition to his academics, Sher met the norms and was awarded the national title and rank Master of Sports of the USSR in Chess (ru) ‚Äì one of twenty-five nationwide to earn the distinction that year (not to be confused with an academic Masters Degree in Sports). Sher's wife, WGM Alla Grinfeld (see Family section below) won the title, Master of Sports of the USSR in Chess, a year earlier. She was one of three women, nationawide, to win the distinction in 1974. Over the prior nineteen years ‚Äì from 1950, when the distinction was first conferred upon women, through 1973 ‚Äì only 56 women had won the title. Sher's tournament successes include a shared 1 place at the 1981 USSR Armed Forces Championship (ru) for chess in Mykolaiv and a shared 3 place at the semifinals of the Soviet Championship that same year. In that tournament, Arkady Novopashin (1932‚Äì2014) (ru) was 2 and WGM Maia Chiburdanidze, age at the time, tied GM Vladimir Tukmakov for 1. GM Adrian Mikhalchishin, also from the Ukraine who had known Sher since childhood, stated that Sher had been a student of Anatoly Gurevich and that he never got to play on the Ukrainian youth team despite his talent because he was competing for spots with future GMs Alexander Beliavsky, Oleg Romanishin, and others. In 1981, Sher became a chess coach for the Russian national team, a role he held until 1985. According to Mikhalchishin, \\"Miron was known for his great opening knowledge, which helped him to become great trainer.\\" In 1986, at the Belavenets Memorial, held annually in Smolensk since 1984 in honor of Sergey Belavenets, Sher shared 1 in a four-way tie with Alexander Baburin (born 1967), Anatoly Donchenko (de) (born 1940), and Viktor Kuporosov (born 1961), each with 8- points. Beginning 1987, when the USSR began relaxing international travel restrictions for Soviet citizens, Sher began to achieve international success. That year, in Prague, Sher placed 2 in a three-way tie. In June 1988, at Novi Sad, Serbia, Sher placed in a seven-way tie for 3 with Arshak Petrosian, Semen Dvoirys, Vladimir Petrienko, Nikolay Legky (ru), and Rajko Miranovic; behind Vereslav Eingorn and Ashot Anastasian (tied for 2), and Vladimir Bagirov (1). In 1989, at Eforie Nord, Romania, he placed 2 in a five-way tie. In 1989, he won outright an international tournament at Balatonber√©ny. In June 1989, Sher placed third, behind GMs Evgeni Vasiukov and Gennadij Timoscenko in Budapest at the XIV Elekes Dezs≈ë Nemzetk√∂zi Sakk Eml√©kversenyt ( Dezs≈ë Elekes International Chess Memorial Competition), an annual event inaugurated in 1976 in honor of the statistician and chess player, Dezs≈ë Elekes (hu) (1889‚Äì1965). In 1990, in Belgorod, he shared 1 with Evgeni Vasiukov (see game with Ratmir Kholmov at www.chessgames.com). In 1991, in Belgorod, Sher shared 1 with Igor Novikov and Maxim Sorokin. In October 1993, he tied for 1 at the Farum Open with GMs Lars Bo Hansen (de), Raj Tischbierek (de), Henrik Danielsen, Ralf √Ökesson, and Nick de Firmian. In December 1994, as the winner of the 1993‚Äì1994 Hastings Challengers, he qualified for the 1994‚Äì1995 Premier tournament, where he tied 3 with Colin McNab, behind John Nunn (2), and Thomas Luther (1). Sher became an international master in 1988 and a grandmaster in 1992. Beginning 1990, after several visits to Scandinavia, Sher began coaching Peter Heine Nielsen in Copenhagen, which was 45 minutes by plane from Kaliningrad. Every three months, for four years, Sher traveled there to spend a week with Nielsen. According to Sher, they finished in 1994, after Nielsen became a grandmaster, but their relationship endured. In 2013, Nielsen joined the team of assistants who helped Magnus Carlsen prepare for the 2013 Candidates Tournament World Championship. Before that, Nielsen was on Viswanathan Anand's team. While working with Magnus, Nielsen turned to Sher for coaching advice. As of 2020, Nielsen is second in the world behind World Champion GM Magnus Carlsen. In New York, Sher coached in several scholastic chess programs, including, for many years, the Dalton School, whose chess director, David MacEnulty, is portrayed in the 2005 film, Knights of the South Bronx. Other scholastic programs included IS 318, subject of the 2012 film, Brooklyn Castle, and Stuyvesant High School. Sher coached GM Fabiano Caruana from age 8 to 12 ‚Äì 2000 to 2004. According to a 2002 article in the Lincoln Journal Star, Caruana's weekly regimen ‚Äì with no mention of school ‚Äì consisted of roughly 28 hours training, 5 one-hour lessons with Sher, 4 hours playing on the Internet Chess Club site, 15 hours of tournament competition, and 4 hours of solving chess problems. Caruana, as a dual citizen of the U.S. and Italy, holds many distinctions in chess. Notably, at age 14, he became the youngest U.S. and Italian citizen to become a grandmaster. But before that, while Sher was coaching him, he became the youngest U.S. player to defeat a grandmaster. On September 30, 2002, at the Marshall Chess Club, Caruana, at age , defeated GM Aleksander Wojtkiewicz, who then was and ranked eighth in the U.S. In 2005, Caruana, with his family, moved to Madrid where he trained with Boris Zlotnik (ru) until 2015. Zlotnik had worked 16 years in the Chess Department of Sher's alma mater, the State Central Order of Lenin Institute of Physical Education. Grigory Goldberg (ru) (1908‚Äì1976) founding Director of the Chess Department had hired Zlotnik as a Senior Lecturer in 1975; and from 1985 to 1991, Zlotnik served as Director of the Department. In 1992, Zlotnik emegrated to Spain and settled in The Pyrenees and Madrid and became a Spanish citizen. Beginning around 1999, while living in New York, Sher began training Keaton Kiewra, a -year-old from Lincoln, Nebraska. Sher had been highly recommended by David MacEnulty and Bruce Pandolfini. Sher mentored Kiewra through high school, in chess camps and by phone ‚Äì two hours a week. At age ‚Äì January 8, 2011 ‚Äì Kiewra qualified as an international master at the Berkeley International, a tournament that marked a rare week for U.S. Chess, if ever, in which four Americans, Kiewra included, earned qualifying titles: Sam Shankland, 19, grandmaster; Daniel Naroditsky, 15, and Conrad Holt, 17, international masters. In that tournament, Kiewra defeated GM Robert Hess. Sher also coached Darrian Robinson (born 1994), who, when the Chicago Tribune published an article about her in 2014, was the highest rated African American female chess player in the U.S. Chess Federation system. In 2009, the World Chess Federation established a Trainers' Commission, who in turn established criteria for certified FIDE educator credentials: (i) Senior Trainer, (ii) Trainer, (iii) Instructor, (iv) National Instructor, and (v) Developmental Instructor. Sher, who was among several distinguished coaches who disapproved, commented, \\"I don't need this piece of paper from FIDE to be considered a good coach.\\" Yet, Sher submitted an application because GM Yuri Razuvaev, a fellow Russian who was chairman of the commission, asked him to do so. Reflecting on the rationale of his decision, Sher stated, \\"if only not good coaches were on the list, it would not be good.\\" Sher became a FIDE senior trainer.  Family  Sher and his wife, Alla Berkovna Grinfeld (ru) (), a Woman Grandmaster, met while Sher was studying in Voronezh, Russia. Alla is a distinguished scholastic chess educator in New York and worked closely with Miron in chess education. Alla was born in Spassk-Dalny, Primorsky Krai, Russia. Sher had stated that the impetus for emigrating from Russia in 1997 was out of concern that his son, Mikhail, would be drafted in the Russian military. Mikhail, who began his U.S. education in the 9 grade, has gone on to earn degrees at Carnegie Mellon (B.S. Mathamatics/B.S. Economics, 2005), Columbia (M.S. Operations Research, 2006), and Drexel (Ph.D., 2015) and is now a scholar and educator in supply chain management.  Death  Sher died August 21, 2020, in New York City. He was buried August 23, 2020, at Mount Carmel Cemetery, Glendale. In an obituary for Sher published by the U.S. Chess Federation, GM Robert Hess stated that Sher had been his one and only coach.

Tabor was a principal investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases where he was Chief of the Laboratory of Biochemical Pharmacology. He was the editor-in- chief of the Journal of Biological Chemistry from 1971 to 2010.  Education  Tabor was born in New York City in 1918. Tabor received a Bachelor of Arts at Harvard College in 1937 and a Doctor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) in 1941. He was a researcher in the department of biological chemistry at HMS in 1941. Tabor worked in the lab of John Peters researching a carbon monoxide method to measure blood volumes while he completed a medical internship at Yale New Haven Hospital from 1942 to 1943.  Career  Tabor was a principal investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) until 2020 and was the Chief of the Laboratory of Biochemical Pharmacology from 1962 to 1996. At the time of his death he held the record as the longest-serving employee in the history of the National Institutes of Health (77 years).Washington Post obituary Tabor was the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Biological Chemistry from 1971 to 2010. Under his direction the journal expanded from 1,000 to 4,500 published articles per annum. He led the transition to online publishing in 1995.  Research  Tabor researched the function of polyamines and their role in human health and disease. His research program investigated the biochemistry, regulation, and genetics of these amines and of the biosynthetic enzymes in S. cerevisiae and E. coli. Their work has demonstrated that the polyamines are required for growth of the organisms, their sporulation, protection against oxidative damage, protection against elevated temperatures, fidelity of protein biosynthesis, and for the maintenance of mitochondria. Tabor's lab has constructed clones that overproduce the various enzymes and have studied the sequence and structural characteristics of these enzymes. The research has concentrated on the structure and regulation of ornithine decarboxylase, spermidine synthase, spermine synthase, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.  Awards and honors  Tabor was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1977. In 1986, Tabor and his wife, Celia White Tabor, won the Hillebrand Prize from the Chemical Society of Washington. In 1995, they received a William C. Rose Award.  Personal life  Tabor married physician-scientist Celia White in 1946. The couple had met through common friends six years earlier on a Boston streetcar. They moved to the NIH campus in 1949 where they raised their daughter and three sons. Celia White Tabor died in 2012. Tabor died at his home on the NIH campus on August 20, 2020.

Preparation  1,2,3-Benzothiadiazole is readily prepared by the diazotisation reaction of 2-aminothiophenol or its disulfide with sodium nitrite, as originally reported in 1887 and reviewed in several subsequent publications. :400px The crystal structure was published in 2005.  Reactions  The extent of the aromaticity of the compound was examined by comparison with naphthalene, which allowed the conclusion that it behaved as a 10-electron system in which the sulfur atom contributed its lone pair to the resonance structures, in accordance with H√ºckel's rule. However, 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole is much less reactive than naphthalene in its electrophilic aromatic substitution chemistry, for example only forming nitro derivatives under forcing conditions. For that reason, many of its simple derivatives have been made either from already-substituted 2-aminothiophenols or by the Herz reaction in which a substituted aniline is treated with disulfur dichloride and the intermediate 1,3,2-benzothiazathiolium salt is diazotised to complete the formation of a 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole. The parent system cannot be made this way, since the use of aniline in this reaction leads to formation of the 6-chloro derivative. 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole is a very weak base and alkylation reactions give exclusively the 3-amino quaternary salt.  Applications  1,2,3-benzothiadiazole has been claimed to synergise insecticides including dicrotophos but has not been commercialised for that application.

P. Lovecraft and his collaborators. Byakhee The byakhees or byakhee birds first appeared in Lovecraft's short story The Festival and were later featured in August Derleth's tale The House on Curwen Street. They are the servants of the Great Old One Hastur. Lovecraft provides a description of the byakhees in The Festival: Deep Ones The Deep Ones first appeared in Lovecraft's novella The Shadow Over Innsmouth (1931), but were already hinted at in the early short story \\"Dagon\\". The Deep Ones are a race of intelligent ocean-dwelling creatures, approximately human-shaped but with a fishy appearance. They regularly mate with humans along the coast, creating societies of hybrids. Numerous Mythos elements are associated with the Deep Ones, including the legendary town of Innsmouth, the undersea city of Y'ha- nthlei, the Esoteric Order of Dagon, and the beings known as Father Dagon and Mother Hydra. After their debut in Lovecraft's tale, the sea-dwelling creatures resurfaced in the works of other authors, especially August Derleth.The Deep Ones are a popular fixture in Derleth's Cthulhu Mythos fiction, appearing in about half of his tales. (\\"Derleth's Use of the Words 'Ichthic' and 'Batrachian, Crypt of Cthulhu #9.) Lovecraft provides a description of the Deep Ones in The Shadow Over Innsmouth: Lovecraft describes the Deep Ones as a race of undersea-dwelling humanoids whose preferred habitat is deep in the ocean (hence their name). However, despite being primarily marine creatures, they can come to the surface and can survive on land for extended periods of time. All Deep Ones are immortal; none die except by accident or violence, and they can grow to massive size. They are said to serve the beings known as Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, as well as Cthulhu.Robert M. Price suggests that \\"Dagon\\" and Cthulhu are actually the same entity, Dagon being \\"the closest biblical analogy to the real object of worship of the deep ones\\"‚ÄîThe Innsmouth Cycle, Robert M. Price, ed., p. ix. They are opposed by mysterious beings known as the Old Gods, whose powerful magic can keep them in check. This detail is one of the vestigial hints that August Derleth developed as the mostly unnamed Elder Gods. Deep One hybrid The backstory of The Shadow over Innsmouth involves a bargain between Deep Ones and humans, in which the aquatic species provides plentiful fishing and gold in the form of strangely formed jewelry. In return, the land- dwellers give human sacrifices and a promise of \\"mixing\\"‚Äîthe mating of humans with Deep Ones. Although the Deep One hybrid offspring are born with the appearance of a normal human being, the individual will eventually transform into a Deep One, gaining immortality‚Äîby default‚Äîonly when the transformation is complete. The transformation usually occurs when the individual reaches middle age. As the hybrid gets older, he or she begins to acquire the so- called \\"Innsmouth Look\\" as he or she takes on more and more attributes of the Deep One race: the ears shrink, the eyes bulge and become unblinking, the head narrows and gradually goes bald, the skin becomes scabrous as it changes into scales, and the neck develops folds which later become gills. When the hybrid becomes too obviously non-human, it is hidden away from outsiders. Eventually, however, the hybrid will be compelled to slip into the sea to live with the Deep Ones in one of their undersea cities. Father Dagon and Mother Hydra Mother Hydra and her consort Father Dagon are both Deep Ones overgrown after millennia ruling over their lesser brethren. Together with Cthulhu, they form the triad of gods worshipped by the Deep Ones (their names are inspired by Dragon, or Dagon, the Semitic fertility deity, and the Hydra of Greek mythology). Mother Hydra is not to be confused with the entity in Henry Kuttner's story \\"Hydra\\". Y'ha-nthlei \\"Cyclopean and many-columned Y'ha- nthlei\\"Lovecraft, The Shadow Over Innsmouth. is the only Deep One city named by Lovecraft. It is described as a great undersea metropolis below Devil's Reef just off the coast of Massachusetts, near the town of Innsmouth. Its exact age is not known, but one resident is said to have lived there for 80,000 years.\\"For eighty thousand years Pht'thya-l'yi had lived in Y'ha- nthlei\\". Lovecraft, The Shadow Over Innsmouth. In Lovecraft's story, the U.S. government torpedoed Devil's Reef, and Y'ha-nthlei was presumed destroyed, although the ending of the story implies it survived. The name Y'ha-nthlei may have been inspired by the Lord Dunsany character \\"Yoharneth-Lahai\\", \\"the god of little dreams and fancies\\" who \\"sendeth little dreams out of PEGANA to please the people of Earth.\\"Price makes this suggestion in the introduction of Dunsany's \\"Of Yoharneth-Lahai\\", The Innsmouth Cycle, p. 1. Other authors have invented Deep One cities in other parts of the ocean, including Ahu-Y'hloa near Cornwall and G'll-Hoo, near the volcanic island of Surtsey off the coast of Iceland.Brian Lumley, \\"Rising With Surtsey\\". Anders Fager has described the city of \\"Ya' Dich-Gho\\" as located in the Stockholm skerries. It is accidentally destroyed in 1982 during a Swedish submarine-hunt. At least two surviving Deep Ones live in Stockholm. One of them sells aquarist's supplies. The destruction of Ya' Dich-Gho is described in \\"When Death Came to Bod Reef\\"; the city's history in \\"Herr Goering's Artefact\\" and the life of the survivors in \\"Three Weeks of Bliss\\". Elder Things The Elder Things (also known as the Old OnesThe term \\"Old Ones\\" is ambiguous in the Cthulhu Mythos and can also refer to the Great Old Ones, a separate group of beings described as being enemies of the Elder Things in At the Mountains of Madness. and Elder OnesIn At the Mountains of Madness, Professor Lake dubs the specimens he discovers \\"Elder Ones\\" in reference to the Elder Things of the Necronomicon, unaware that they are actually the same beings.) are fictional extraterrestrials in the Cthulhu Mythos. The beings first appeared in H. P. Lovecraft's novella, At the Mountains of Madness (published in 1936, but written in 1931), and later appeared, although not named, in the short story \\"The Dreams in the Witch-House\\" (1933). Additional references to the Elder Things appear in Lovecraft's short story \\"The Shadow Out of Time\\" (1936). Description Description of a partial headless body: > Six feet end to end, three and five-tenths feet central diameter, tapering > to one foot at each end.

In furrows between ridges are curious growths‚Äîcombs or > wings that fold up and spread out like fans ... which gives almost seven- > foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal > myth, especially fabled Elder Things in the Necronomicon. :‚ÄîH. P. Lovecraft, > At the Mountains of Madness In the Mythos canon, the Elder Things were the first extraterrestrial species to come to the Earth, colonizing the planet about one billion years ago.Harms, \\"Appendix D: Timeline of the Cthulhu Mythos\\", The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana, p. 384. They stood roughly eight feet tall and had the appearance of a huge, oval-shaped barrel with starfish-like appendages at both ends. The top appendage was a head adorned with five eyes, five eating tubes, and a set of cilia for \\"seeing\\" without light. The bottom appendage was five-limbed and was used for walking and other forms of locomotion. The beings also had five leathery, fan-like retractable wings and five sets of branching tentacles that sprouted from their torsos. Both their tentacles and the slits housing their folded wings were spaced at regular intervals about their bodies. Lovecraft described the Elder Things as vegetable-like or echinoderm-like in shape, having radial symmetry instead of the bilateral symmetry of bipeds. They also differed in that they had a five-lobed brain. The Elder Things exhibited vegetable as well as animal characteristics, and in terms of reproduction, multiplied using spores, although they discouraged increasing their numbers except when colonizing new regions. Though they could make use of both organic and inorganic substances, the Elder Things were carnivorous by preference. They were also amphibious. The bodies of the Elder Things were incredibly tough, capable of withstanding the pressures of the deepest ocean. Few died except by accident or violence. The beings were also capable of hibernating for vast epochs of time. Nonetheless, unlike many other beings of the Mythos, the Elder Things were made of normal, terrestrial matter. Technology The technology that the Elder Things possessed was not described at length, but was described as being extremely advanced. They are also revealed in At the Mountains of Madness as being the creators of a servitor race, the shoggoths. Society Because they reproduced through spores, there was little biological basis for families to form, and were thus grouped together with others with whom they would get along. Elderian \\"families\\" lived in large dwellings, where furniture and other decoration was placed in the center of the rooms, to leave the walls open for murals. > In furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the huge > rooms, leaving all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment.

Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness In \\"The Dreams in the Witch-House,\\" the central character is sent through a dimensional portal to a planet in a triple star system (with a yellow, red, and blue star) located \\"between Hydra and Argo Navis\\", and populated by Elder Things. History On Earth, the Elder Things built huge cities, both underwater and on dry land. They may be responsible for the appearance of the first life-forms on Earth, including the entity known as Ubbo-Sathla (although sources differ in this regard). They created the shoggoths to be their all- purpose slave race. Eventually, however, the shoggoths rebelled--an event that hastened the decline and ultimate collapse of their civilization. Although the Elder Things managed to initially subdue the shoggoths after their attempted rebellion, the shoggoths continued to improve physiologically, increasing in intelligence and developing the capacity to live on land. The Elder Things are known to have warred against the star-spawn of Cthulhu, the Great Race of Yith, and the Mi-go. Despite these conflicts, it was the gradual cooling of the planet during the last ice age that spelled their doom. Retreating to their undersea cities deep in the ocean, they would thereafter have no further dealings with the outer world. Their last surface city, located on a high plateau in the Antarctic, remains frozen in ice. The ruins of this city were discovered in 1931 by two members of an Antarctic expedition from Miskatonic University. The last known and most significant undersea city is located directly beneath the Elder Things' ultimate surface city in the Antarctic, and was apparently overrun by the shoggoths. Four of the eight Elder Things (still alive after millions of years) unearthed by other members of the Miskatonic expedition were described in the story At the Mountains of Madness as being survivors from an early age of the species' civilization. They were killed by a shoggoth while attempting to find a means to enter the subterranean ocean in the Antarctic, apparently unaware of the city's collapse. Not named, but implied by description, the Elder Things appeared in \\"The Dreams in the Witch House\\". Ghouls See Pickman's Model. Gugs See The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. Hounds of Tindalos A Hound of Tindalos is a fictional creature created by Frank Belknap Long and later incorporated into the Cthulhu Mythos when it was codified by August Derleth. They first appeared in Long's short story \\"The Hounds of Tindalos\\", first published in the March 1929 issue of Weird Tales. Lovecraft mentions the creatures in his short story \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\" (1931). Description In Frank Belknap Long's original story, which deals with the main character experimenting in time travel with the help of psychedelic drugs and esoteric artifacts, the Hounds are said to inhabit the angles of time, while other beings (such as humankind and all common life) descend from curves. Though the Hounds are sometimes pictured as canine, probably because of the evocative name, their appearance is unknown, since neither Long nor Lovecraft describe them, arguing they are too foul to ever be described. Long's story states that their name \\"veils their foulness\\". It is said that they have long, hollow tongues or proboscises to drain victims' body-fluids, and that they excrete a strange blue pus or ichor. They can materialize through any corner if it is fairly sharp--120¬∞ or less. When a Hound is about to manifest, it materializes first as smoke pouring from the corner, and finally the head emerges followed by the body. It is said that once a human becomes known to one of these creatures, a Hound of Tindalos will pursue the victim through anything to reach its quarry. A person risks attracting their attention by traveling through time. Men of Leng See The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. Mi-Go The word Mi-Go comes from \\"Migou\\", a Tibetan word for yeti. The aliens are fungus-based lifeforms which are extremely varied due to their prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill. The variants witnessed by Akeley in \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\" look like winged humanoid crabs. Mi-Go are first named as such in Lovecraft's short story \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\" (1931). However this is considered an elaboration on earlier references in his sonnet cycle Fungi from Yuggoth (1929‚Äì30) to descriptions of alien vegetation on dream-worlds. Description The \\"Mi-Go\\" are large, pinkish, fungoid, crustacean-like entities the size of a man; where a head would be, they have a \\"convoluted ellipsoid\\" composed of pyramided, fleshy rings and covered in antennae. They are about long, and their crustacean-like bodies bear numerous sets of paired appendages. They possess a pair of membranous bat-like wings which are used to fly through the \\"aether\\" of outer space.The aether concept attempted to explain the travel of light through space and is now scientifically discredited, but was widely accepted up to about 1900 and was presumably part of Lovecraft's education. The wings do not function well on Earth. Several other races in Lovecraft's Mythos also have wings like these. In the original short story, the creatures cannot be recorded using ordinary photographic film, due to their bodies being formed from otherworldly matter. They are capable of going into suspended animation until softened and reheated by the sun or some other source of heat. The Mi-Go can transport humans from Earth to Pluto (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's living brain and placing it into a \\"brain cylinder\\", which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak. In \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\" the Mi-Go are heard to give praise to Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, suggesting some form of worship. Their moral system is completely alien, making them seem highly malicious from a human perspective. One of the moons of Yuggoth holds designs that are sacred to the Mi-Go; these are useful in various processes mentioned in the Necronomicon. It is said that transcriptions of these designs can be sensed by the Mi-Go, and those possessing them shall be hunted down by the few remaining on earth.In \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\", a \\"black stone with unknown hieroglyphics\\" from Yuggoth is among the items owned by the narrator that the Mi-Go want to recover as part of their plot to lure him to the Akeley farmhouse. Supposedly, a group known as the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign are dedicated to hunting them down and exterminating the fungoid threat, though it is unknown if this is actually true since it was given as a reason for their remaining hidden. Hastur, which is mentioned in passing among several other places and things, was eventually converted into a god-like alien being by August Derleth who gave it the title \\"Him Who is Not to be Named\\". However, in \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\", a human ally of the Mi-Go mentions \\"Him Who Is Not to Be Named\\" in the list of honored entities along with Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath. Origin of the word It is possible that Lovecraft encountered the word migou in his readings. Migou is the Tibetan equivalent of the yeti, an ape-like cryptid said to inhabit the high mountain ranges of that region.Mi-Go is the compound word for \\"man-wild\\" (wild man; Wylie: mi rgod; Tib: ‡Ωò‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ω¢‡æí‡Ωº‡Ωë‡ºã) in Tibetan and is pronounced me-g√∂. (See Goldstein, pp. 251, 792, 794.) While the Mi-Go of Lovecraft's mythos is completely unlike the migou of Tibetan stories, Lovecraft seems to equate the two, as can be seen in the following excerpt from \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\": Moon-beasts See The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. Nightgaunts See The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. Serpent Men See Serpent Men. Shoggoths Shoggoths (occasionally shaggothThis spelling appears in the original Arkham House printing for \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\" (1937 or shuggoth), though the definitive manuscripts show that the proper spelling is in fact \\"shoggoth\\". (Burleson, H. P. Lovecraft, A Critical Study, footnote #14, p. 195.)) were mentioned in passing in H. P. Lovecraft's sonnet cycle Fungi from Yuggoth (1929‚Äì30) and later described in detail in his novella At the Mountains of Madness (1931). Description The definitive descriptions of shoggoths come from the above-quoted story. In it, Lovecraft describes them as massive amoeba-like creatures made out of iridescent black slime, with multiple eyes \\"floating\\" on the surface. They are \\"protoplasmic\\", lacking any default body shape and instead being able to form limbs and organs at will. A typical shoggoth measures 15 feet across when a sphere, though the story mentions the existence of others of much greater size. Being amorphous, shoggoths can take on any shape needed, making them very versatile within aquatic environments. Cthulhu Mythos media most commonly portray shoggoths as intelligent to some degree, but deal with problems using only their great size and strength. The shoggoth that appears in At the Mountains of Madness simply rolls over and crushes numerous giant penguins that are in its way as it pursues human characters. The character Abdul Alhazred is terrified by the mere idea of shoggoths' existence on Earth. The shoggoths bear a strong physical resemblance to Ubbo-Sathla, a god-like entity supposedly responsible for the origin of life on Earth. Fictional history At the Mountains of Madness includes a detailed account of the circumstances of the shoggoths' creation by the extraterrestrial Elder Things. Shoggoths were initially used to build the cities of their masters. Though able to \\"understand\\" the Elder Things' language, shoggoths had no real consciousness and were controlled through hypnotic suggestion. Over millions of years of existence, some shoggoths mutated, developed independent minds, and rebelled.

More precisely, it has been proposed that it dates to pharaoh Djer or Djet, who was the third king of the First Dynasty, and who is known for his victorious expeditions to Nubia. The relief comes from the second cataract, one of the most ancient frontiers in the history of mankind, in an area just south of Buhen. It is now kept in the National Museum of Sudan. The relief was transferred to the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum in 1963, before the drowning of the area by the water of the Lake Nasser. Inscribed on a large block of sandstone (2,75m x 0,80m), it is an early example of low relief carving, possibly describing a war between the Egyptians and the A-Group Nubian people. It describes the victory of an Egyptian king, embodied by his serekh, although the serekh does not give a specific royal name. The circles at the bottom represent cities. The boat is considered as an embodiment of the king, dominating defeated Nubians. The iconography is comparable to that of the earlier Gebel el-Arak Knife or the fresco from Tomb 100 at Hierakonpolis, all corresponding to the Naqada II period of Prehistoric Egypt, and might be considered as a slight archaism meant to legitimize the rule of the early pharaoh who authored the relief. The symbolism and early hieroglyphic markings do point to the First Dynasty or Second Dynasty of Egypt. A second inscription found nearby represents a large scorpion with bound captives, and seems to be from an slightly earlier date, and possibly related to king Scorpion II. The \\"Scorpion relief\\".

The khanqah (locally known as a tekke) dates to the 18th century and was used for ceremonies of the Khalwati order of Sufis. History and description The one-story rectangular building includes two alcoves. A half-open portico faces northwest flanked by five carved wooden pilasters, two of them featuring ivory carvings. Part of the upper fa√ßade above shows what is left of an engraved frieze. Each alcove served a distinctive purpose. The mejda odasi hosted gatherings of dervishes before and after their ceremonies or dhikr, and opens through a door on its western wall to the portico adjacent to its chimney. The ceremonial semahane is near the first room in the southern corner, with the entrances about 30 cm apart. Two of the five gates of the semahane face east, two of them face south, and one faces west. Square windows include smaller pointed semicircular openings on their left. The mihrab east of the second alcove remains. In the room are a made bed, several photos, improvised tombs, and ritual items such as three swords, a pair of handcuffs, and a flag. The khanqah was built from stone, adobe, wood, and mud mortar, topped with a four-layer clay tile roof extending over the porticos. The stone yard wall was renovated after the Kosovo War. Seven tombs nearby include those of Zeynel, Rusta, Ibrahim, Ali, Ismail, Abdyl, and an unknown foreigner.

Biography  Dilgo Khyentse Family Lhamo was born in Kham in eastern Tibet to a modest family in 1914. She married Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche when she was nineteen years old. The marriage was arranged quickly since Dilgo Khyentse had fallen ill after an austere retreat and his mentor, Dzongsar Khyentse Ch√∂kyi Lodr√∂Greg Zwhalen, , prophecied that a wife would heal him (despite the fact he did not want to marry, even though as a tert√∂n he could die at young age if he did not); Lhamo did help him recover and was recognised as a ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´. They travelled together whilst her husband undertook spiritual retreats; Lhamo also received Buddhist teachings with him in Tibet. The late 1950s saw the People's Republic of China invade Tibet, one of the first places they reached was Kham, where Lhamo and Khyentse were living. In order for Khyentse to escape Chinese soldiers, Lhamo sent him a secret message warning him to flee to Lhasa. In 1959, accompanied by their two daughters and a small group of disciples, they fled Tibet to reach Bhutan. Khandro Lhamo was a highly accomplished Doctor of Tibetan medicine, who contributed to the construction and maintenance of Shechen Monastery in Nepal. After the death of Khyentse Rinpoche in 1991, she lived in the monastery Shechen Orgyen Chodzong in Bhutan and worked with Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche their son, to develop the institution for women. Lhamo died on 30 March 2003 and was cremated in June 2003; relics of her eyes, tongue and heart were kept.

Arakelian was a specialist in theoretical astrophysics and extragalactic astronomy. He is most noted for his catalog of ‚ÄúGalaxies of high surface brightness‚Äù (named Arakelian galaxies, Akn), a list of 621 objects with surface brightness at least 22.0 magnitude from an area of 1 sq. arc second. The Arakelian catalog has become a source in the study of active galactic nuclei. Early life and education Arakelian was born in Goris, Syunik Province in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, a Soviet republic (now the Republic of Armenia). He attended the Yerevan State University (YSU) in the Physical-Mathematical Department and graduated in 1951. He was among the first YSU students specialized in astrophysics. Arakelian was assigned to the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory (BAO), where he worked first as assistant astronomer, and later as junior research associate. His postgraduate study at Leningrad State University (now Saint Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg) was completed in 1955, and in 1956 he successfully defended his Ph.D. thesis ‚ÄúSpectrophotometric investigation of Algol‚Äù under the supervision of Prof. Oleg Aleksandrovich Melnikov at LSU. Career The Byurakan Observatory in 2008 From 1957 to 1959, Arakelian combined his work with a senior teacher position at the Department of Astrophysics at Yerevan State University. Aralekian was a junior researcher and lectured at the Leningrad State University from 1960 to 1966. After being awarded the title of Associate Professor in 1966, Arakelian again joined the staff at Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory, combining his research with a position as lecturer at Yerevan. Together with L.V. Mirzoyan, A.T. Kalloghlian, and H.M. Tovmassian, he was the co-author of the textbook Astronomy for secondary schools (three editions in 1970, 1971, and 1973). In 1967, he became a senior researcher at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory. In 1977, Arakelian defended his second doctoral thesis \\"Spectral observations and statistics of galaxies with active nuclei\\" at Moscow State University (MSU) and became a Doctor of Sciences. In 1982, he was elected the Chair of the Department of Astrophysics and Theoretical Physics of the Armenian State Pedagogical University named after Khachatur Abovian. Arakelian wrote an extended review on ‚ÄúClusters of galaxies‚Äù in the book Problems of Extragalactic Astronomy (1981). Prior to his death at the age of 54 on 20 January 1983 in Moscow, Arakelian devoted himself to research, publishing over 80 articles. Bibliography *Arakelian, M. A.

The work is one of four sculptures of Roman virgin martyrs commissioned by the Bakers' Guild to decorate the church of Santa Maria di Loreto in Rome. It was completed in the course of four years from 1629 to 1633. Giovanni Pietro Bellori, comparing Duquesnoy's achievement with the Saint Susanna to that of Polyclitus with his Doryphoros and its Kanon, commented [Duquesnoy has] left to modern sculptors the example for statues of clothed figures, making him more than the equal of the best ancient sculptor. The statue is considered by modern scholars an exemplification of Duquesnoy's 'Greek ideal,' which included an approach to drapery unpopular at the time, established through the study of antique models selected by Duquesnoy. Duquesnoy's maniera greca would later influence Johann Joachim Winckelmann, and through him the Neoclassicism movement. Jacob Burckhardt regarded the sculpture as \\"the best statue of the 17th century.\\" With its clinging drapery juxtaposed to her modest gaze and clothing, Duquesnoy's Santa Susanna was considered by contemporaries an \\"admixture of eroticism and modesty.\\" The figure follows the concept whereby \\"the drapery should not be so thick as to make it appear like stone, but must be arranged around the body in folds, so that the nude underneath is sometimes discernible but sometimes artfully concealed without any hardness which can obscure the members of the figure.\\" Such approach was at odds with the spectrum of contemporary sculpture, specifically Bernini's expressive use of heavy, billowing drapery. Duquesnoy's St. Susanna doesn't look upwards to heaven, but down at humanity, with her hand pointing down to the altar. This, too, was at odds with Bernini's exuberance and mystification of naturalness and humanity. The Santa Susanna made a powerful impression on contemporary artists and critics, provoking \\"admiration as well as critical debate over its style and relation to the antique.\\" However, the sculpture did not become widely recognized outside Rome until 18th century. In the early 18th century, Domenico de Rossi's engraving of the statue helped to initially increase its celebrity, which was consolidated internationally when a copy by Coustou was completed and sent to the Paris' academy at the Louvre in 1739. Detail of the sculpture Background The Saint Susanna was commissioned together with four other sculptures of Roman virgins by the confraternity of the Roman Baker's Guild, to decorate the newly extended choir of their church of Santa Maria di Loreto, located close by the Forum of Trajan. While the disposition of the four statues within the church has been altered in the years, the choir was conserved virtually intact. In 1628, four artists were engaged to carry out the church's planned decoration, but neither was Duquesnoy engaged at this time, nor was Saint Susanna thought to be among the Roman virgins' statues to be produced and installed in the church's choir. After Maderno and de Rossi (two of the four original sculptors engaged by the Bakers) quickly carried out the first of the two statues they were initially supposed to produce for the Bakers, instead of commissioning a second statue from them, as implied in their contract, Duquesnoy and Giuliano Finelli, two of the most promising young sculptors in Rome, were engaged. The sculptors were to be payed 150 scudi each. The Roman Saint Susanna, like the other saints in San Maria di Loreto a symbol of Christian chastity and beauty, was probably chosen as an emblem of faith and virtue through which inspire the young unmarried Roman women assisted by the confraternity, whose work of charity included the annual provision of dowries to enable daughters of poor bakers to marry or to enter convent. Production There is debate over whether Duquesnoy secured the St. Susanna's commission as a result of the critical success of his St. Andrew or the other way around. In the 17th century, it was generally believed that the success of the former (St. Susanna) secured Duquesnoy his commission for the St. Andrew. The opinion of the early biographers has given rise to a continuing discussion over the sculptures' chronology. Mariette Fransolet, like the early biographers, believed that Pope Urban VIII himself sought a design from Duquesnoy, later approving the Fleming's model at the Congregazione della Fabbrica of Saint Peter's meeting in May 1628. She placed the completion and exhibition of a definitive model of the St. Susanna at sometime in early 1627. However, there is no documented involvement of the sculptor with the St. Susanna prior to the end of 1629. Although early biographers and other 20th century scholars such as Mariette Fransolet believed that the critical success of the St. Susanna preceded that of the St. Andrew, modern scholars tend to discredit this assertion. Based on documentary record, Duquesnoy received the commission for the St. Susanna in mid-December 1629, months after he had received his first payment for his work on the St. Andrews. The cardinal protector of the confraternity of the Baker's guild was Cardinal Biscia, a bibliophile and patron of the arts who served also in the Congregazione della Fabbrica of St. Peter, which commissioned Duquesnoy's St. Andrew and the other three colossuses in St. Peter. It is possible that Biscia recommended Duquesnoy to the Bakers after assisting at the unveiling of the St. Andrew's model in St. Peter on December 10, 1629. Duquesnoy took delivery of the marble for the St. Susanna on January 31, 1630. Like Finelli, he took more time to execute his statue than Ferrucci, Moderno and de Rossi. It was as late as March 6, 1631 that Duquesnoy received his first fifty scudi for his work on the Santa Susanna. Duquesnoy received his second payment the following August, and the statue was installed in the choir over a year and a half later, on March 29, 1633. The final payment of fifty scudi to Duquesnoy was issued in May 1633. However, the last payment order was subsequently cancelled, and Duquesnoy's final payment for the St. Susanna was not reissued until January 11, 1635. Meanwhile, Duquesnoy petitioned the confraternity for reimbursement for additional expenses, and was indeed reimbursed by August 1633. The reason for the confraternity's delay in paying Duquesnoy his final fifty scudi is unclear. In the 1630s, Duquesnoy suffered of gout, attacks of vertigo and depression, which would debilitate him until his death in 1643. His poor health affected his productivity, which drastically decreased at that time. This may well account for the delays in both the completion of the St. Susanna and Duquesnoy's final payment, with the church withholding the latter until all details were set on the already installed statue. Bellori reports that while installing the St. Susanna's metal palm, Duquesnoy had an attack of vertigo, fell from the ladder and almost lost his life. Style and composition Both Bellori and Passeri emphasized the sculpture's relation to the antique. According to Bellori and Passeri, the sculpture proposes a \\"calibrated tension between eroticism and modesty,\\" which is \\"played out in the sculpture in the shifting relationship between the body and the drapery.\\" Passeri commented: > The form of her dress is a religious imitation of the most beautiful ancient > statues as far as the use of draperies, which, although covering, reveal > openly the entire nude, but not in a free and licentious manner, and, while > [the drapery] allows the form of the breasts to be distinguished, they > remain covered in a way that indicates perfect modesty The torso of Duquesnoy's St. Susanna is covered with continuous vertical marks made with the claw of the chisel, reproducing the loose waves of the fabric while also outlining the torso. The mantle plays a role in outlining the body as well; running in long diagonal folds across the body, and drawn close to the saint's side, it culminates in a \\"cascade parallel to the weight bearing leg,\\" with its softly carved, horizontal lines delineating the volume of the relaxed leg. She minimally lifts her left hand from beneath her mantle, pointing to the altar. St. Susanna wears a thin tunic that clings to her chest in thin vertical folds, accentuating the figure's round breasts. The statue was sculpted in accordance with Duquesnoy's own conception of great ancient sculptures' characteristics; however, the statue is extremely naturalistic. This aspect was not present in many ancient Roman sculptures. Duquesnoy gave the figure its naturalistic aspect through painstaking carving. He did so according to his consideration of it as a fundamental aspect of his imaginary Greek ideal. Santa Susanna was portrayed with soft cheeks, a tender expression, and a retiring and averted gaze, which further underscores her modesty. The arrangement of her hair, with its \\"graceful waves parted and gathered at the back of the head without the adornment of escaping curls\\" is reminiscent of the typical ancient depiction of the virgin goddesses Diana and Artemis, which Duquesnoy used as prototypes for his virgin martyr. Although critics have seen the fullness of her cheeks as a departure from the antique and a 17th century's idiosyncrasy, this, too, was typical of Artemis' profile representation on Roman coins. In spite of the restrained coiffure of St. Susanna and her full cheeks, her face was modeled by Duquesnoy upon the features of Venus, the goddess of beauty and eroticism. This is evinced in her heart-shaped face, dimpled chin and slightly open mouth; the elongated nose and her wide-set, almond shaped eyes. The arrangement of her hair in a modest chignon produces \\"the same fateful tension embodied in the simultaneously modest and revealing drapery.\\" Through her physiognomy, too, Duquesnoy was therefore able to create an original composition that successfully expressed the beauty, erotic appeal and chastity of the virgin martyr. Duquesnoy, as expressed in his maniera greca theory, believed that the best ancient draped statues were those that \\"remained closest to the purity of the Greek nude through the use of thin, body-revealing drapery.\\" As recorded by Duquesnoy's pupil Boselli, \\"[The ancients] did not have another aim, nor other end, or intention, than to dress the nude while showing it, to cover it by displaying it\\" and \\"one must drape with suitable and lovely folds... the antique made draped figures as if they were nude.\\" Although Duquesnoy drew inspiration from Greek sculpture, his was still an imaginative vision based on his own perception of the latter's characteristics. Although the opus has been tentatively compared to other sculptures present in Rome by contemporaries, he in fact produced a completely new and quite original aesthetic object, based on his own perception, wherein traits of both valuable Roman sculpture and ancient Greek ones were combined. Duquesnoy \\"went well beyond simple imitation to recombine and transform his sources in accordance with his understanding of the verisimilitude, emotive power, and material refinement of ancient Greek art.\\" Critical reception and influence Despite the St. Susanna's considerable impact on the art world in contemporary Rome, the statue was little known outside the eternal city. Rubens, in writing to Duquesnoy to thank him for the casts of the Van den Eynde's putti the Fiammingo had sent to him, did indeed compliment him for the beauty of the Eynde's putti, and he did refer to the fame of Duquesnoy's St. Andrew, but he did not mention the St. Susanna at all. It was not until the 18th century that the Saint Susanna was discovered by a broader international audience. In the 17th century, copies of the statue were very rare, even within Rome. In 1736, however, Nicolas Wleughels, excited by the statue's beauty and the prospect of sending a copy of it to France, where the statue was \\"certainly unknown\\", decided to ask the Baker's Guild to remove the statue from its niche, in order to make copies of it. A copy in marble by Guillaume Coustou was completed and sent to Paris in 1739, where it was installed in the Hall of Antiquities of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture at the Louvre. This gave the statue first international recognition, precipitating a surge of interest for the latter, which over the next decades was included in the canon of exemplary sculptures in virtually all major art academies in Europe. During a casting of the statue ordered by Venetian collector Filippo Farsetti, with the copy intended to be placed in his study museum in Venice (whose casts would be studied by young Antonio Canova), to the dismay of the confraternity, the forefinger of the saint's left hand was broken, and the face discolored. In the late 17th century, the statue continued to be much admired, with its popularity now probably at its apex. In 1763, Spanish sculptor Isidoro Carnicero made a reduced-scale copy of it, which is still preserved in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. A few years later, Flemish sculptor Pierre- Fran√ßois Le Roy paid homage to the St. Susanna in his Saint Catherine, which he produced for the Royal Chateau of Laeken in Bruxelles. Due to the growing popularity of the Saint Susanna and the damage it suffered during its unfortunate 1753 casting by Farsetti, the confraternity decided to move the statue to the altar of the Chapel of the Magi, were it was accessible to the public, who flocked there to venerate it. The church cited the statue's removal and the damage done by Farsetti as the reasons for their denial of further casting of the statue. In 1781, the church denied Francesco Righetti's request for the execution of a cast from the statue. Righetti had been commissioned by Boston-native art collector and banker Henry Hope to cast twelve lead-copies of the most prominent sculptures in Rome, which were to be installed in his Neoclassical Villa Welgelegen in Haarlem. He mostly selected famous antique sculptures, but he specifically required Duquesnoy's Saint Susanna. Being denied permission, Righetti was forced to settle for a cast of Saint Susanna's copy at the French Academy in Rome. According to his scholar Estelle Lingo, this opus was the manifesto of Duquesnoy's gran maniera greca, an imaginative vision based on his own perception of ancient Greek sculpture, in which the latter was associated with slenderness, subtle contours, nudity or, among clothed statues, body-disclosing drapery. Winckelmann, writing under the influence of Duquesnoy's concepts a hundred years later, added: \\"and a noble simplicity and quiet grandeur, both in posture and expression.\\" This is discernible in the St. Susanna's modestly averted gaze stemming from godlike features. Winckelmann, an admirer of Duquesnoy circle's maniera greca, drew his Neoclassical ideas from Sandrart, who was indeed a member of Duquesnoy's circle. Duquesnoy's ideas had therefore an indirect influence on the birth of the Neoclassicism movement; the Saint Susanna was \\"Duquesnoy's exemplification of his theory,\\" and the sculpture was \\"clearly viewed as such by his contemporaries.\\" Duquesnoy's Saint Susanna is today duly acknowledged as one of the most significant sculptures of 17th century's Rome, with frequent citations stressing it importance in the historical literature of art and sculpture.

In November 1960 a regional high school was built in Burlington, Connecticut which was chosen to be named Lewis S. Mills High School after Mills' contributions to education in the area.  Early Life  Mills was born into a farming family in the town of Canton, Connecticut on 5 September 1874 to Deacon Archibald Mills and Mary Loomis Mills. The family grew apples, tobacco, and hay at their farm in Canton, which was built in 1821. Although little is known about Mills' parents, his father Deacon Archibald Mills served in the American Civil War with the 22nd Connecticut Volunteer Regiment and was described as having been \\"frugal\\" and \\"harsh\\". Lewis Mills was ultimately a descendant of Ephraim Mills, who is credited with giving the town of Canton its name. In 1877 at the age of three Lewis Mills suffered an injury which caused him to wear a leg brace for the rest of his life. Due to his injury, Mills' father referred to him as \\"Little Lewis\\" in his diary. At the age of five, Mills first entered school, although at seven Mills' father began to make him work on the farm harvesting tobacco. After the age of 14, Mills' father did not allow him to continue his education and hoped that he would continue to work on the family farm. At the age of 18 Mills' mother died, although on her deathbed she was able to convince her husband that Lewis should be able to continue his education into high school. At 18, Mills enrolled in Collinsville High School with his father's newfound approval. In 1897 Mills published his first poem, and in 1901 he purchased his first camera for fifty dollars. In 1902 as Mills began taking photographs of Canton and the surrounding area, his father constructed a photography studio for him in their home.  Career  In 1902, Mills published his first photo; he was asked by news reporters to sneak into a railroad car in Willimantic to take a photograph of quarantined smallpox victims inside, which he did. For his photograph, Mills was paid one-hundred dollars. With the money he earned, Mills bought a more expensive camera, and went around Connecticut on a horse and buggy taking photographs. Mills took a particular interest in photographing one-room school houses in Connecticut. Aside from school houses, the subjects of Mills' photographs included churches, rural scenes, and members of Native American tribes, such as the Mohegan. Mills interest in photographing rural schools brought him very close to the educational shortfalls of Northwestern Connecticut at that time. Having at first been denied higher education by his father, Mills advocated for students to remain in school until 7th grade or 16 years of age before they be allowed to leave. From 1908 to 1939 Mills served as a Supervising Agent for the Connecticut State Board of Education. During the 1910s, Mills took up positions in local government to allow him to better assist local schools, which included becoming the Rural Supervisor of Schools in Burlington. During his time as part of the Plainville, Burlington, and Harwinton local governments, Mills wrote books for students and teachers including The Government of the People in the State of Connecticut which was an educational work intended to be propagated in local schools. Barkhamstead Lighthouse. The site was extensively written about in Mills' 1952 book The Legend of Barkhamstead Light House. During his time as part of local governments and even after his retirement in 1939, Mills continued to document rural historical sites and other locations in Connecticut through his photography and writing. One of Mills' most widely-remembered works was The Legend of Barkhamstead Light House which combined the historical situation and general stories and legends surrounding the Barkhamstead Lighthouse from the 18th century into a single work. Although considered to be one of the most complete historical accounts of the Barkhamstead Lighthouse, the work is written in a form similar to that of the Kalevala.  Legacy  Lewis S. Mills died in 1965, five years after Lewis S. Mills High School was built at the age of 90. Many of Mills' photographs of rural Connecticut in the early-20th century are irreproducable, since many of the locations have either been destroyed or changed since when his photographs were originally taken. Mills' literary works on Connecticut history including The Story of Connecticut and The Legend of Barkhamstead Light House are considered to be well-written works in their areas of research, and in the case of The Legend of Barkhamstead Light House, it is still used as a main source of information in the history of the Barkhamstead Lighthouse.

Schulz, who was a friend of Zwilich. It was commissioned for the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra by the Carnegie Hall Corporation, and first performed by the pianist Albert Kim and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra at Carnegie Hall on March 22, 1997. Zwilich dedicated the piece to Schulz, \\"in hopes that it will give him a small measure of the pleasure that his Peanuts characters have given all of us.\\" Background Schulz first learned of Ellen Taaffe Zwilich through a profile of her on The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour in July 1990. In a Peanuts strip later that year, Peppermint Patty and Marcie attend a concert featuring a flute concerto which Marcie tells Patty is by Ellen Zwilich, who \\"happens to be a woman.\\" Zwilich contacted Schulz to thank him and the two became friends. Thus, when Carnegie Hall asked Zwilich to write a piece of children's music, she proposed to Schulz that she would compose a work based on Peanuts characters; Schulz enthusiastically agreed. On March 16, 1997, six days before the world premiere, Schulz once again referenced Zwilich in a Peanuts comic celebrating the new composition. In that comic, Schroeder tells Lucy about the new composition, saying \\"we're all in it\\" and naming each of the movements; looking at a copy of the score, Lucy simply responds, \\"My part should be longer.\\" The creation of Peanuts Gallery was later documented in a PBS special of the same name, featuring rare interviews with Charles M. Schulz, his wife Jean Schulz, and the composer. Structure The concerto lasts about 13 minutes and is scored for flute, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, percussion, strings, and solo piano. Each movement is inspired by a Peanuts character: #Schroeder's Beethoven Fantasy #Lullaby for Linus #Snoopy Does the Samba #Charlie Brown's Lament #Lucy Freaks Out #Peppermint Patty and Marcie Lead the Parade Recording A recording of Peanuts Gallery, performed by Jeffrey Biegel and the Florida State University Symphony Orchestra, and conducted by Alexander Jim√©nez, was released on album together with Zwilich's Images and Millennium Fantasy through Naxos Records in September 2010.

Early life and education Hart was born on October 8, 1932 in Kingston, Jamaica, but grew up in Montego Bay. He attended Munro College between 1941 and 1948, and worked briefly at the Casablanca Beach Hotel in Montego Bay, before enrolling at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Business Career In 1950, Hart returned to Montego Bay after a fire destroyed his father's business establishment, Samuel Hart and Son. In 1951, He started Jamaica's first record manufacturing company, Records Ltd, in Kingston. The same year, he left Samuel Hart and Son and established Jamaica Electronics in Kingston, but returned to Montego Bay in early 1953. Soon after, he acquired the rights to a subagency for the dealership of Ford, the American automobile manufacturer. Hart called it the Northern Industrial Garage (NIG). NIG sold 300 cars in three months, at a time when cars were relatively few on Jamaican roads. He later also expanded the business to include a franchise for Avis Car Rental. Hart is credited with starting the Montego Freeport deepwater pier, industrial hub, and Free Zone in 1967, and served as its founding Chairman and Managing Director from 1967 to 1980. He was chairman of Jamaica's national airline Air Jamaica from 1980 to 1988, and is attributed with bringing the only flights by the supersonic Concorde aircraft to Montego Bay airport in 1987. Hart is credited with establishing more than 50 companies. Political Career In 1962, Hart served as campaign manager for the successful campaign of Herbert Eldemire in the Saint James North Western constituency. He also served as a Parish Councillor for the St. James Parish Council during the sixties.

Being developed by the international real estate organisation Vastint, it will mostly occupy the abandoned brownfield site of the former Tetley's Brewery. It is named after the River Aire, which flows nearby. As well as parkland, the development includes four new mixed-use and four new residential buildings, and the demolition of a warehouse and a five-storey office building which was occupied by Carlsberg. It will retain the Art Deco former brewery headquarters turned contemporary art gallery The Tetley, and Salem Chapel. History Buildings to be demolished Hunslet is now an inner-city area of Leeds immediately south of Leeds railway station, bounded on the north and east by the River Aire. It was a rural village until rapid growth during the 19th century as a result of the Industrial Revolution. The area between Meadow Lane and Crown Point Road became the brewery of Joshua Tetley and Son in 1822,R. G. Wilson, ‚ÄòTetley, Joshua (1778‚Äì1859)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, October 2007; online edn, January 2008 accessed 19 March 2014 which was replaced by the construction of a new brewery designed by George Corson began in 1852. By 1860 Tetley was the largest brewery in the North of England, and in 1931, the Art Deco Tetley headquarters building was erected. Tetley's was fully taken over by Carlsberg in 1998, which had owned 50% since 1993, who announced the brewery's closure in 2008, with the final brew taking place in 2011 and lager production transferring to Northampton. After demolition of most of the brewery buildings except the office blocks, the brewery site has remained under-utilised. It is partly vacant, partly in temporary use as surface car parking and greenspace, and since 2013 has been home to a contemporary art gallery and art hub in the redeveloped 1930s headquarters building. The site was bought by Vastint, a commercial real estate company related to IKEA which specialises in large-scale mixed-use schemes. An outline planning application submitted by Vastint was approved in principle by Leeds City Council's City Plans Panel in October 2017, which provided for a phased development of up to 850 residential units, business and hotel uses, and a city park with a minimum of of public realm. After initially being known as the \\"city park\\" pending choice of a permanent name, Vastint announced in September 2019 that the green space will be called Aire Park. The reserved matters application will be considered by Plans Panel on 3 September 2020. Features The Crown Hotel, Crown Point Road The park is promoted as a bustling and open district revitalising a forgotten part of the city, effectively extending the city centre southwards. Andrew Cobden, managing director of Vastint UK, said: \\"The South Bank has been really fragmented over the years. We feel we have a real opportunity to connect parts of the city back together.\\" As well as a 400-bed hotel and other architectural developments, 500 trees are planned to be planted. The park area will be divided into 5 character areas: # The Tetley Triangle ‚Äî Event Space to the north-west of the Tetley ‚Äì hard surfaced event space for concerts, markets, outdoor cinema, outdoor caf√© space, approximately the size of half the paved area of Millennium Square # The Tetley Triangle ‚Äî The Green ‚Äì to the west of the Tetley - grassed and stepped amphitheatre for informal performance and sitting, a similar size to Merrion Street Gardens # Theatre Gardens ‚Äî north of Salem Chapel - modern ornamental and sensory garden for quiet enjoyment # The Central Park ‚Äî east of the Tetley to Crown Point Road - including significant parkland including grassed areas and trees, water feature, play area and grassed mound # Link Ways ‚Äî greened communal connectors between new building plots with wide pathways, trees, planting, and benches As part of a regeneration masterplan for the whole South Bank of Leeds, Aire Park will be integrated with improvements to the surrounding area, particularly by extending the greenspace across City Council owned land to a new footbridge over the River Aire linking to Sovereign Street and Leeds station. Additionally, plans have been submitted to reopen the derelict Crown Hotel on Crown Point Road as a pub and restaurant space, which has been closed since the early 1990s, and to include a memorial to David Oluwale, a British Nigerian who drowned in the River Aire in 1969.

They also gave rise to several lines that held English peerages, the longest-living going extinct in the male line in the 15th century, as well as a Norman branch of the family that persisted into the 13th century. A French line persisted into the 16th century. Origin The family is first documented holding Ferri√®res-Saint- Hilaire in Normandy, an important centre for ironworking, perhaps the reason the manor took its name. Their Norman toponymic surname, de Ferri√®res, would evolve into simply de Ferrers, sometimes Latinized as de Ferrariis. Walkelin de Ferri√®res, the first documented family member, was killed in the civil wars of William II, Duke of Normandy.Collections for a History of Staffordshire, William Salt Society, London, 1887, vol. 8, p. 66.K. S. B. Keats Rohan, Domesday People, Boydell Press, Woodbridge, 1999, p. 247. His son, Henry de Ferrers, was Lord of Longueville in Normandy when he participated in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Henry brought three of his feudal followers and tenants to England in his retinue, namely the knights de Curzon (from Notre Dame-de-Courson), the de Baskerville (from Boscherville) and the de Levett (from Livet-en-Ouche), who all subsequently founded prominent English families. Henry was richly rewarded by King William the Conqueror by the grant of 210 manors throughout England and Wales, situated mainly in Derbyshire and Leicestershire. He first served William I in England as the Governor of Stafford Castle and in about 1066 or 1067 he was granted the lands in Berkshire and Wiltshire of the defeated Anglo-Saxon Goderic, the former Sheriff of Berkshire. Henry acted as a Commissioner for the compilation of the Domesday Book of 1086 and was soon appointed the first Anglo-Norman Sheriff of Berkshire. He built Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, which he adopted as his caput. He also built castles at Duffield and Pilsbury. Henry died 1100 at Tutbury Priory in Staffordshire, where he and his wife Bertha, perhaps a member of the L'Aigle family, had founded Tutbury Priory in 1080. They had at least four children, a daughter Amicia, wife of Nigel d'Aubigny of Cainhoe, and sons William, Engenulph and Robert, who became the first Earl of Derby. Earls of Derby Robert de Ferrers, youngest son of Henry, rose in the service of king Stephen of England, and was awarded the Earldom of Derby after serving as one of Stpehen's commanders at the Battle of the Standard in 1138. The earldom would descend in his family until Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby was attainted in 1267 for his participation in the Second Barons' War against king Henry III. Draconian terms were set for the reacquisition of his lands, and he was only able to have the manor of Chartley, Staffordshire, restored to him in 1275. Though the family ceased to hold the earldom, two new peerages were created in his immediate family, his son being later created Baron Ferrers of Chartley, while a nephew became the 1st Baron Ferrers of Groby. Barons Ferrers of Chartley John Ferrers, son of the 6th Earl, carried on an unsuccessful life-long struggle to have his father's properties restored, but was himself summoned to Parliament in 1299 as Baron Ferrers of Chartley. This peerage continued in his line until William de Ferrers, 7th Baron Ferrers of Chartley died in 1450 without male issue, after which it passed into several successive families descending from them in the female line before going into abeyance in 1855. =Baron of Wem= In 1375, Robert de Ferrers, a younger son of the 3rd Baron Ferrers of Chartley and grandson of the 1st Baron, was summoned to parliament as Robert Ferrers of Wem. By modern usage, this would be seen to have created a novel peerage, the Barons Ferrers of Wem. However, Vicary Gibbs has argued that such a formulation would be anachronistic, and that he should be viewed as simply a recognition of his claim, jure uxoris to the title inherited by his wife, heiress of the Barons Boteler of Wem. Were it a new creation then his son Robert Ferrers of Wem would be considered the 2nd Baron, but following Gibbs, he held no title as he predeceased his mother. Any claim to the title would have gone into abeyance via the son's two daughters. Barons Ferrers of Groby Months after John de Ferrers became the 1st baron Ferrers of Chartley, his first cousin William de Ferrers, son of Sir William de Ferrers of Groby Castle in Leicestershire and himself a younger son of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby was summoned to Parliament in December 1299 as Baron Ferrers of Groby. The title continued in the male line until the death of William Ferrers, 5th Baron Ferrers of Groby in 1445 without male issue, when it continued via a female line, becoming forfeit in 1554. Ferrers of Oakham, Rutland The Norman lands of English founder Henry de Ferrers passed to one of his two elder sons, William or Engenulf, and thence to a younger Henry de Ferrers, a son of one of these two. He also held lands in England, at Lechlade, Gloucestershire, and Oakham, Rutland. His son, Walchelin de Ferriers, inherited both Henry's English and Norman lands, but the loss of Normandy to the King of France led to a division of the estate, with the Norman properties continuing through his son Henry to a line of lords of Ferriers and Chambrais that only went extinct in 1504, while Lechlade and Oakham passed via his daughter Isabel to the Mortimers of Wigmore. Heraldry Due to the etymology of their surname, sources say that the early heraldic device of the de Ferrers family was a horse-shoe, or six black ones on a white background, blazoned: Argent, six horseshoes sable. However Fox-Davies in his Complete Guide to Heraldry (1909) suggests that these were in fact the arms of the Marshal family, the ancient military office of marshal being responsible for the care (and thus shoeing) of war-horsesLarousse, Dictionnaire de la langue francise, \\"Lexis\\", Paris, 1979, p.1107, Mar√©chal (marhskalk, 1155), officier charg√© du soin des chevaux \\\\- the first wife of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby, by whom he had only daughters, was Sibyl Marshal, a daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. In reality the arms adopted by the de Ferrers family at the start of the age of heraldry (c.1200-1215) were: Vairy, or and gules. However William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby (c.1193-1254) added to his paternal arms A bordure azure (or sable) charged with eight horseshoes argent,Cokayne, G. E.; Gibbs, Vicary & Doubleday, H.

London, p.340, note (d) perhaps as a mark of difference. At Oakham Castle in Rutland, built in 1180/90, ceremonial horseshoes are still presented today by prominent visitors in honour of the de Ferrers family, described in James Wright's 1684 History and Antiquities of the County of Rutland:Quoted in Battle Abbey Roll :The Lord of the castle and manor of Okeham for the time being claims by prescription a Franchise or Royalty very rare and of singular note, viz. : That the first time any Peer of this Kingdom shall happen to pass through the precincts of this Lordship, he shall forfeit as a Homage a Shoe from the Horse on which he rideth unless he redeem it with money. The true Original of which custome I have not been able on my utmost endeavour to discover. But that such is, and time out of mind hath been, the Usage, appears by several Monumental Horseshoes (some gilded and of curious Workmanship) nail'd upon the Castle Hall Door. Many survive, each inscribed with the name and title of the peer who presented it. Many bear crests and coronets, the so-called \\"Golden Shoe\\" (taken off Lord Willoughby de Eresby's favourite horse \\"Clinker\\") was \\"once abstracted by some ingenious thief who mistook the gilding for gold; but returned it in a railway parcel on discovering his error\\".Cleveland, Battle Abbey Roll In lieu of his paternal arms, the first Baron Ferrers of Groby adopted his maternal arms Gules, seven mascles or conjoined 3:3:1, the arms of de Quincy.Cokayne, G.

Directed by Lance Drake, it was released on 17 August 2020 in a one-night only worldwide IMAX release, with a download and streaming release on 21 August. The film combines live concert footage from Muse's shows at the O2 Arena in London from 14‚Äì15 September 2019, which were part of their worldwide Simulation Theory World Tour that took place throughout 2019, with more traditionally filmed scenes that take place in between and during songs, making up the film's narrative. Plot A group of scientists are sent to investigate a mysterious source producing unknown paranormal activity, which leads them to a concert stage located in London with an arcade cabinet on it. One of the scientists called Murphy (Graham Butler), touches the cabinet, causing him to break the fabric of his reality and is transported into another one where he finds himself in the crowd of a live Muse concert. After being pulled back to his reality, he is then bitten by a mysterious phantom, causing him to become infected with an unknown pathogen and mutate into a monster. A woman (Hannah Whiteoak) then appears and reveals that she is an NPC from the \\"mainframe\\". The NPC explains that due to a tear in their reality, a deadly virus has been released and Murphy has become a new entity known as the \\"Truth Slayer\\". The media reports on the virus and large sections of London are quarantined off to curb the infection rate, with multiple NPCs coming to fight off the infected people. The NPC then take control of the news broadcasts and puts words in their mouths, stating that the virus is a hoax and that \\"there is nothing to fear\\". The Truth Slayer then breaks out of his containment and a hero, known as \\"The One\\" (Matthew Bellamy), enters the same reality to stop him from gaining control of more. The One gains access to the mainframe, gaining the power of a glove, and confronts the Truth Slayer. After a climatic battle, The One prevails and defeats the Truth Slayer.

The organization attracted attention following the federal grand jury indictment of Bannon, Brian Kolfage, and several of their associates on charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with the We Build the Wall fundraising project. Finances Citizens of the American Republic is a dark money organization. Bannon has declined to describe or identify the group's donors.Maggie Haberman and Jeremy W. Peters, Bannon's New Group Issues a Midterm Plea: Save Trump, New York Times (August 15, 2018). The group reported no contributions in the 2017 tax year. According to its tax filings, the group raised approximately $4.45 million in 2018, of which a single donor contributed $2 million, and most of the rest was part of \\"six- and seven-figure donations\\" from a small number of donors. In 2018, the group reported making a $200,000 loan and a $50,000 payments to Bannon's film company, Bannon Film Industries Inc. The group also reported $40,000 in payments to Sean Bannon (Steve Bannon's nephew) and $20,000 in payments to Mary E. Meredith (Steve Bannon's sister), who was listed as the group's vice president. The group reported making only $15,000 in grants that year, of which $10,000 went to volunteer fire department where Bannon hosted a political rally. The group reported spending $1.1 million on \\"other expenses\\" (vendors) and more than $1.4 million on \\"conferences, conventions and meetings.\\" History and operations Bannon founded Citizens of the American Republic in 2017, after he was abandoned by his previous financial backers, Robert Mercer and Rebekah Mercer.Kenneth P. Vogel, Jonathan Martin & Jeremy W. Peters, Led by the Mercers, Bannon's Allies Abandon Him, New York Times (January 4, 2018). The New York Times reported in January 2018 that, according to Bannon's associates, Bannon aimed to raise between $25 million and $100 million \\"to build an antiestablishment political operation\\" that would spend money on Republican primary election campaigns, with half going to voter mobilization initiatives and half going to political advertising. Bannon reportedly \\"spent months quietly courting some of the deepest pockets on the right\\" to raise money for the effort. The group is a platform for Bannon to promote President Donald Trump's views via podcasts and films. According to the organization it was formed to \\"advance the ideals of American nationalism and American sovereignty.\\" The organization's website features videos and other content promoting \\"economic nationalism\\" and advocating against illegal immigration. In 2018, the group focused on an attempt to keep Republican control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 election. During that year, Bannon's associate Guo Wengui (also known as Miles Kwok), exiled Chinese billionaire businessman, allowed Bannon to use one of his two private jets to travel to events in support of Republican congressional candidates in New Mexico and Arizona. The flights were revealed in February 2020 by ProPublica. Bannon made the flights under the auspices of Citizens of the American Republic. Several campaign finance experts who spoke with ProPublica said the trips could violate federal campaign finance law, which prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions to candidates in U.S. political campaigns (including in-kind contributions such as payment for campaign-related travel). Guo and Bannon denied that the travel was for campaign activity; an attorney for Bannon's group stated that the trips on the private jet were to promote Bannon's film, Trump@War. In 2019, Bannon hired Cleta Mitchell, a high-profile conservative attorney who has also represented the NRA, to represent the organization. The organization attracted attention following the federal grand jury indictment of Bannon, Brian Kolfage, and several of their associates on charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with the We Build the Wall fundraising project. The indictment alleges that Bannon used \\"Non-Profit-1\\" (a group matching the description of Citizens of the American Republic) to divert funds from the wall group. According to the indictment, federal prosecutors plan to seek forfeiture of the assets of the organization, as well as from other Trump- aligned political organizations.

Apple is a current lawsuit brought by Epic Games against Apple in August 2020 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, related to Apple's practices in the iOS App Store. Epic Games specifically had challenged Apple's restrictions on apps from having other in- app purchasing methods outside of the one offered by the App Store. Epic Games' founder Tim Sweeney had previously challenged the 30% revenue cut that Apple takes on each purchase made in the App Store, and with their game Fortnite, wanted to either bypass Apple or have Apple take less of a cut. Epic implemented changes in Fortnite purposely on August 13, 2020 to bypass the App Store payment system, prompting Apple to block the game from the App Store and leading to Epic filing its lawsuit. Epic also filed another lawsuit, Epic Games v. Google, the same day, which challenges Google's similar practices on the Google Play app store for Android, after Google pulled Fortnite following the update for similar reasons as Apple. However, Google has stressed that the legal situation around their case is not the same around Apple's. Background Since as early as 2017, Epic Games' co-founder and CEO Tim Sweeney had questioned the need for digital storefronts like Valve's Steam, Apple's iOS App Store, and Google Play, to take a 30% revenue sharing cut, and argued that when accounting for current rates of content distribution and other factors needed, a revenue cut of 8% should be sufficient to run any digital storefront profitably. While a 30% revenue cut was an industry standard across computers, consoles, and mobile platforms in 2019, Sweeney stated that higher revenue shares made sense on consoles where \\"there's enormous investment in hardware, often sold below cost, and marketing campaigns in broad partnership with publishers\\", but did not expend to open platforms like mobile devices and personal computers. Part of the reasoning for creating the Epic Games Store was to demonstrate that Epic could operate at a lower revenue cut (12%). As Fortnite expanded from personal computers to other platforms with the popularity of the Battle Royale mode in 2018, Epic Games sought to bring the free-to-play game to mobile devices. When Epic first released its Android client, it offered it as a sideloaded package rather than as a Google Play store app, as they did not want Google to take any revenue from the microtransactions in the game. However, this resulted in a number of security concerns and numerous unscrupulous clones attempting to pass themselves off as the real Fortnite game in the Google Play store, and by April 2020, Epic discontinued the sideloaded version and placed the game on the Google Play store. As Apple does not allow sideloading on iOS devices, Epic had just released the client on the App Store directly in 2018. In mid-2020, Sweeney reiterated his stance on the 30% revenue cut that Apple and Google took, ahead of a large United States Congressional hearing investigating antitrust charges on the Big Tech companies including Google, and during similar investigations of Apple in the European Union. Sweeney said in a July CNBC interview that \\"Apple has locked down and crippled the ecosystem by inventing an absolute monopoly on the distribution of software, on the monetization of software\\", and \\"Google essentially intentionally stifles competing stores by having user interface barriers and obstruction\\". Sweeney further stated that \\"If every developer could accept their own payments and avoid the 30% tax by Apple and Google we could pass the savings along to all our consumers and players would get a better deal on items. And you'd have economic competition.\\" After Apple stated that cloud gaming services like Microsoft's xCloud were not allowed on the iOS platform as they would allow content that bypassed Apple's content review, Sweeney wrote \\"Apple has outlawed the metaverse. The principle they state, taken literally, would rule out all cross-platform ecosystems and games with user created modes: not just xCloud, Stadia, and GeForce NOW, but also Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox.\\" Onset of legal action On August 13, 2020, Epic Games updated Fortnite across all platforms, including the iOS and Android versions, to reduce the price of \\"V-Bucks\\" (the in-game currency) by 20% if they purchased directly from Epic. For iOS and Android users, if they purchased through the Apple or Google storefront, they were not given this discount, as Epic said they could not extend the discount due to the 30% revenue cut taken by Apple and Google. Within hours, both Apple and Google had removed Fortnite from their storefronts stating the means of bypassing their payment systems violated the terms of service. Epic immediately filed separate lawsuits against Apple and Google for antitrust and anticompetitive behavior in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Epic retained the legal counsel of Christine A. Varney, formerly lead of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice under the Obama administration, for both cases. As part of the suit against Apple, Epic also released a video called \\"Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite\\", parodying Apple's \\"1984\\" advertisement using Fortnite assets, which Epic points out in their lawsuit had been used by Apple then to challenge the weight of IBM at the time. In its suit against Apple, Epic accused Apple of antitrust behavior with its practices around the App Store and its payment system, charging that these were in violation of the federal Sherman Act and the California Cartwright Act. In its suit towards Google, Epic challenged Google's past mantra of \\"Don't be evil\\" and claimed that its practices around the Google Play store and its payment system violate the Sherman Act and California's Cartwright Act. Epic stated that Google's restrictions on the Android system interfered with deals for pre-loading Fortnite on phones from OnePlus and LG. They state in the claim \\"Notwithstanding its promises to make Android devices open to competition, Google has erected contractual and technological barriers that foreclose competing ways of distributing apps to Android users, ensuring that the Google Play Store accounts for nearly all the downloads of apps from app stores on Android devices.\\" Epic did not seek monetary damages in either case but instead was \\"seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands, if not more, of third-party app developers.\\" In comments on social media the next day, Sweeney said that they undertook the actions as \\"we're fighting for the freedom of people who bought smartphones to install apps from sources of their choosing, the freedom for creators of apps to distribute them as they choose, and the freedom of both groups to do business directly. The primary opposing argument is: 'Smartphone markers can do whatever they want.' This as an awful notion. We all have rights, and we need to fight to defend our rights against whoever would deny them.\\" Google, in response to the lawsuit, stated to The Verge that \\"For game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users. While Fortnite remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available on Play because it violates our policies. However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play.\\" By August 17, 2020, Apple had informed Epic that it would terminate its access to developers accounts and tools for the App Store and iOS and macOS by August 28, 2020. This led Epic to file a motion for a preliminary injunction to block this as well as prevent Apple from delisting Fortnite from the App Store, asserting that lack of access to the development tools for iOS and macOS would affect Unreal Engine development and subsequently impact all developers that used the engine. Apple stated in response to the request for preliminary injunction that Epic had approached them in June to ask for a special deal for Epic to operate Fortnite on the App Store to allow users to pay Epic directly, and when Apple had failed to grant them this, Epic had contacted them prior to updating the version on August 13, 2020 to state they were willingly going to violate the App Store terms. Apple further requested the court deny Epic the preliminary junction, calling the \\"emergency\\" situation one that Epic had created itself. Sweeney stated in response that as his emails in Apple's complaint said, he was looking for Apple to extend to this type of exemption to all iOS developers and not just for Epic Games. Epic filed a response to Apple's complaint with support of Microsoft, specifically asking the court to block Apple from taking away its iOS development tool access as this would impact all developers that have used the Unreal Engine. Microsoft wrote in their support, \\"Denying Epic access to Apple‚Äôs SDK and other development tools will prevent Epic from supporting Unreal Engine on iOS and macOS and will place Unreal Engine and those game creators that have built, are building, and may build games on it at a substantial disadvantage.\\" On August 24, 2020, after a court hearing Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers granted Epic's request to prevent Apple from taking away its developer licenses for iOS and macOS, but did not grant the preliminary injunction to overturn Apple's decision to remove Fortnite from the iOS store. Rogers wrote that the removal of the developers licenses had \\"potential significant damage to both the Unreal Engine platform itself, and to the gaming industry generally\\" and Apple \\"has chosen to act severely\\" in threatening that step. On terms of Fortnite, Rogers agreed with Apple that \\"Epic Games has not yet demonstrated irreparable harm. The current predicament appears of its own making.\\" Subsequently, Apple terminated Epic's iOS developer account on August 28, 2020, thereby preventing the company from uploading further material to the App Store but otherwise still being able to develop for the platform. Prior to the first hearing on September 28, 2020, Epic filed paperwork ahead of the hearing in which they intend to seek a preliminary injunction to require Apple to rehost Fortnite. Countersuit Apple filed a countersuit against Epic on September 8, 2020. Apple asserted in their suit that Epic breached their contract and was seeking to block the use of Epic's payment system from any app, including Fortnite, on the iOS storefront, and sought monetary damages to recover funds that Epic had made while their version of Fortnite was active on August 13, 2020. Apple called the Epic's suit an attempt \\"to be part of a marketing campaign designed to reinvigorate interest in Fortnite\\". Hearing At the first court hearing on the matter on September 28, 2020, Judge Rogers appeared likely to deny Epic's demand to require Apple to rehost Fortnite on the App Store unless they conform to the App Store policy, siding with Apple that Epic had created the situation leading to its removal itself, but otherwise ready to maintain the restraining order related to the Unreal Engine and Epic's developer accounts. Judge Rodgers did speak to looking towards a jury trial for the case, likely to be heard in July 2021, stating during the hearing \\"I think it's important enough to understand what real people think. Do these security issues concern people or not? Are the concerns of the developers incredibly important? I think many people would feel it is. I do think that this is something for which jury insights would be important.\\" In post-hearing filings, both Epic and Apple have argued that the case should proceed via judge hearings and not through jury trials. Judge Rodgers agreed, scheduling a bench trial to commence in May 2021. Subsequent to this scheduling, Judge Rodgers denied to grant Epic Games a temporary injunction to require Apple to allow Fortnite in its current state (with Epic's storefront), but made permanent the injunction preventing Apple from terminating Epic's developer accounts such that it can continue to maintain the Unreal Engine for iOS and macOS systems. In her decision, Rodgers stated that a key aspect of her review of the case will be Epic's contention that the App Store is unique and their arguments as to why Apple's antitrust behavior is limited to the App Store and not to the other closed systems such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Store or the Nintendo eShop. Rodgers said that \\"a final decision should be better informed regarding the impact of the walled garden model given the potential for significant and serious ramifications for Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft and their video game platforms.\\" Reactions Companies like Facebook, Spotify, and the Match Group supported Epic Games in their lawsuit and spoke of their own past issues with Apple's App Store policies related to their services. Digital Content Next, a non-profit trade group representing media outlets like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, also backed Epic's suit, asserting among other issues that Apple has given out uniquely favorable deals to some providers like Amazon but not to others. After the initial ban, some users attempted to auction iPhones with Fortnite still installed with prices as high as tens of thousands of dollars. By the time the game was actually removed from the App Store, it didn't surprise many users as most people were anticipating it from the beginning and it seemed that many players purely jumped \\"on board for the memes\\", according to Polygon. In September 2020, Epic Games, together with other thirteen companies launched the Coalition for App Fairness, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores. On October 8, 2020, Microsoft announced a commitment to ten fairness principles in the operation of its Microsoft Store on Windows 10, which included promises of transparency over its guidelines, not blocking competing app stores from being used on Windows, and not removing apps from the store based on their business model, how they handle payments, or how their services are delivered. Epic Games v. Google The events and initial actions on Epic's lawsuit against Google were brought on the same day as Epic's suit against Apple, but Google stressed the legal situation around their case is far different. Google asserted that the Android operating system does not have the same single storefront restriction as Apple's iOS, and thus allows different Android phone manufacturers to bundle different storefronts and apps as they desire. Google said they are negotiating with Epic Games far differently from Apple in their case.

On 27 April 2017, Navalny was attacked by unknown assailants outside his office in the Anti-Corruption Foundation who sprayed brilliant green dye, possibly mixed with other components, into his face (see Zelyonka attack). He said he had lost 80 percent of the sight in his right eye. He also said that his doctor believed there was a second corrosive substance in the liquid and that \\"there is hope\\" the lost eyesight would be restored. He also alleged that the attacker was Aleksandr Petrunko, a man who he claimed had ties with State Duma deputy speaker Pyotr Olegovich Tolstoy.Navalny Accuses Police Of Failing To Investigate Attack , by RFE/RLZelyonka: The Green 'Weapon Of Choice' . Navalny accused the Kremlin of orchestrating the attack. Another incident occurred in July 2019, when Navalny was arrested and imprisoned. On 28 July, he was hospitalized with severe damage to his eyes and skin. At the hospital, he was diagnosed with an allergic reaction, although this diagnosis was disputed by Anastasia Vasilieva, one of his personal doctors. Vasilieva questioned the diagnosis and suggested the possibility that Navalny's condition was the result of \\"the damaging effects of undetermined chemicals\\". On 29 July 2019, Navalny was discharged from hospital and taken back to prison, despite the objections of his personal physician who questioned the hospital's motives. Supporters of Navalny and journalists gathered outside the hospital and were then dispersed by police, who arrested several participants. In August 2020, in the days leading up to the poisoning, Navalny had been publishing videos on his YouTube channel in which he expressed support for the pro-democracy 2020 Belarusian protests, which were triggered by the heavily contested 2020 Belarusian presidential election. Navalny had also written that the kind of 'revolution' that was taking place in neighbouring Belarus would soon happen in Russia. Local news site Tayga.Info reported that during his Siberia trip, Navalny had been carrying out an investigation, as well as meeting local candidates and volunteers. When asked if Navalny was preparing an expos√© shortly before he became violently ill, Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol stated \\"I can't reveal all the details, but Navalny was on a work trip. He wasn't relaxing in the regions\\". The video investigation was later published by Navalny's team on August 31. It is assumed that Navalny was poisoned in a politically motivated attack as 'punishment' for his opposition work. Other prominent Russians including activists, journalists and former spies have suffered poisoning attacks in recent decades such as Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 and Sergei Skripal in 2018, both in the United Kingdom. In the former instance, the poison was administered by being placed in Litvinenko's tea. British authorities blamed both attacks on Russian intelligence agencies and an inquiry concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin had \\"probably\\" approved Litvinenko's killing. In the latter instance, a Novichok nerve agent was used. According to The New York Times, experts expressed doubts that the Novichok agent would be used by someone other than a state-sponsored agent. Journalist and human rights advocate Anna Politkovskaya, known for her criticism of Putin and her coverage of the Second Chechen War, fell ill during a flight to cover the Beslan school siege in 2004 after drinking tea in an apparent poisoning attempt. She was later assassinated in 2006. In 2018, Pussy Riot activist Pyotr Verzilov was hospitalised in Moscow and later taken to the Charit√© hospital in Berlin a few days later for treatment which was organised by the Cinema for Peace Foundation after a suspected poisoning, where doctors at the hospital said it was \\"highly probable\\" that he was poisoned. According to activist Ilya Chumakov, who met Navalny along with other supporters the day before his flight, when Navalny was asked why he was not dead, he said that his death would not be beneficial to Putin and that it would turn him into a hero. Poisoning and recovery On 20 August 2020, Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow and was hospitalised in the City Clinical Emergency Hospital No. 1 in Omsk (), where the plane had made an emergency landing. The change in his condition on the plane was sudden and violent, and video footage showed crew members on the flight scurrying towards him and Navalny crying in pain loudly. Afterwards, his spokeswoman said that he was in a coma and on a ventilator in the hospital. She also said that Navalny only drank tea since the morning and that it was suspected that something was added to his drink. The hospital said that he was in a stable but serious condition, and after initially acknowledging that Navalny had probably been poisoned, the hospital's deputy chief physician told reporters that poisoning was \\"one scenario among many\\" being considered. Although doctors initially suggested he suffered from a metabolic disorder caused by low blood sugar, they later stated that he had most likely been poisoned by antipsychotics or neuroleptics and that industrial chemicals such as 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate were found. A photograph on social media taken by a fan appeared to show Navalny drinking tea at a Tomsk airport caf√©, where Interfax news agency reported that the owners of the caf√© were checking CCTV footage to see if any evidence could be provided. By the afternoon, Navalny's wife, Yulia, had reached the hospital from Moscow. She brought with her Navalny's personal doctor, Anastasia Vasilyeva. The authorities, however, initially refused to allow them into the room. They demanded proof in the form of a marriage certificate that Yulia was indeed his wife. A chartered plane paid for by Cinema for Peace Foundation was sent from Germany to evacuate Navalny from Omsk for treatment at the Charit√© in Berlin. The doctors treating him in Omsk had initially declared he was too sick to be transported but later released him, and he arrived in Berlin on 22 August. Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the Omsk hospital, told the press conference on 24 August that they had saved his life and found no traces of any poison in his system; he also said the doctors at the hospital had not been under pressure on the part of Russian officials. The doctors treating him at the Charit√© announced later in the day that while the specific substance was not yet known, clinical findings indicated poisoning with a substance from the group of with a cholinesterase inhibitor, and that they would be performing further tests to discover the exact substance. Evidence might come with the publication of the initiated laboratory testing. As of 2 September 2020, Navalny was in a medically-induced coma. German physicians said that if he recovered lasting effects could not be ruled out. Dr. Murakhovsky wrote a letter to the Charit√©, demanding that they show laboratory data about him being poisoned with a cholinesterase inhibitor, stating the doctors in his hospital found no such evidence. He stated that cholinesterase decrease may have happened either by intake of a compound or naturally, also publishing a purported independent analysis detecting no cholinesterase inhibitors. He confirmed giving him atropine, which is used to counteract certain nerve agents and pesticide poisoning, but claimed the reasons were unrelated to poisoning. On 2 September, the German government said that it had \\"unequivocal evidence\\" that Navalny had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent from toxicology tests carried out by a German Army laboratory. In a statement, Angela Merkel's spokesman said that the \\"Russian government is urgently requested to explain what happened\\" and that the \\"German government condemn[ed] this attack in the strongest possible terms\\". Merkel said that \\"Mr. Navalny ha[d] been the victim of a crime\\" which \\"raise[d] very serious questions that only the Russian government c[ould] and must answer\\". On 7 September, doctors brought Navalny out of the medically-induced coma. In a press release, Charit√© said: On 10 September, news media reported the police protection outside the Charite hospital had been stepped up, that Navalny was able to speak again, but Navalny's spokeswoman described reports of his quick recuperation as \\"exaggerated\\". On 11 September, Bruno Kahl, the head of Germany's foreign intelligence service, revealed that the Novichok agent identified from Navalny's toxicology results was a \\"harder\\" form than previously seen, suggesting it was a different compound from that used to poison the Skripals. The specific compound used was however still not disclosed.Novichok used on Navalny 'harder' than previous form. Reuters, 11 September 2020 On 14 September, the Charit√© hospital said that Navalny was taken off the ventilator and that he is able to get out of bed. For the first time, the hospital said that it published the statement following consultations \\"with the patient and his wife\\", rather than his wife only. On 15 September, Navalny's spokeswoman said that Navalny would return to Russia. Navalny also posted a picture from his hospital bed on social media for the first time since his poisoning. The Kremlin ruled out a meeting between Navalny and Putin. On 17 September, Navalny's team said that traces of the nerve agent used to poison Navalny was detected on an empty water bottle from his hotel room in Tomsk, suggesting that he was possibly poisoned before leaving the hotel. It was also stated that before leaving Russia, Navalny's clothes were seized by the Russian government. On 22 September 2020 the doctors at the Charit√© hospital declared him well enough to be discharged from in-patient care. On 6 October, the OPCW announced that results of testing samples obtained from Navalny had confirmed the presence of a Novichok agent, saying The exact structure of the agent involved has still not been disclosed, but according the announcement above, the compound shares structural similarities with A-232 (the example compound for schedule 1.A.14) and A-242 (the example compound for schedule 1.A.15).  Preliminary investigation  On 27 August, Russian police and the Ministry of the Interior said they had launched a preliminary investigation into the poisoning, described as routine, and inspected Navalny's hotel room, security footage and scouted out his journey for evidence. Police also said that over 100 pieces of potential evidence were collected. Prosecutors said there was no need for a further investigation after the preliminary investigation, claiming it found no sign that a crime had been committed.  Reactions  After the poisoning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Kremlin wishes him a speedy recovery and that law enforcement would launch an investigation if there is confirmation of a poisoning. French President Emmanuel Macron stated that France was ready to offer \\"all necessary assistance ... in terms of health care, asylum, protection\\" to Navalny and his family and demanded clarity on the circumstances surrounding the incident. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also offered any medical assistance necessary in German hospitals. Amnesty International called for an investigation into the alleged poisoning. According to John Sipher, a former CIA station chief in Moscow, \\"Whether or not Putin personally ordered the poisoning, he is behind any and all efforts to maintain control through intimidation and murder\\".Why poison is the weapon of choice in Putin‚Äôs Russia, by Miriam Berger and Adam Taylor, Washington Post, August 21, 2020 The Kremlin denied involvement in the poisoning of Navalny after allegations that Putin sanctioned Navalny's poisoning, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissing them as untrue. On 25 August, the businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has ties with Putin and has been nicknamed \\"Putin's chef\\", was quoted by the press service of his catering company Concord Management and Consulting as saying that he intended to enforce a court decision last year that required Navalny, his associate Lyubov Sobol and his Anti-Corruption Foundation to pay 88 million rubles in damages to the Moskovsky Shkolnik company over a video investigation. Concord's press service said that Prigozhin had bought the debt so that Navalny and his associate would owe him directly. Prigozhin was quoted by the company as saying \\"I intend to strip this group of unscrupulous people of their clothes and shoes\\" and that if Navalny survived, Navalny would be liable \\"according to the full severity of Russian law\\". After the German government concluded that Navalny was poisoned by Novichok, the wife of British policeman Nick Bailey, who was exposed to Novichok after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, tweeted, \\"It's been almost 2 1/2 years after the events in Salisbury and there has been no justice for Dawn and her family and none for the Skripals, Charlie or us. And now it's happened again\\". United States Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun stated that the US finds the German conclusion about the use of Novichok \\"very credible‚Äù and \\"deeply concerning\\". Navalny's chief of staff, Leonid Volkov, stated \\"In 2020, poisoning Navalny with Novichok is the same as leaving an autograph at the scene of the crime\\". The European External Action Service in a statement condemned the poisoning and said that it is \\"essential that the Russian government investigates thoroughly and in a transparent manner the assassination attempt of Mr Navalny\\". On 4 September, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated: \\"Time and again, we have seen opposition leaders and critics of the Russian regime attacked, and their lives threatened. Some have even been killed. So this is not just an attack on an individual, but on fundamental democratic rights. It is a serious breach of international law, which demands an international response.\\" He also asked the Russian authorities to fully cooperate with an impartial international investigation. On 6 September, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany was planning to discuss possible sanctions against Russia if the Kremlin does not provide an explanation soon, saying that any sanctions should be \\"targeted\\". Maas also said that there were \\"several indications\\" that Russian authorities were behind the poisoning. He also said that a lack of support from Russia in the investigation could \\"force\\" Germany to change its position on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. However he also admitted that halting the building of the nearly complete pipeline would harm German and European companies. While recovering after discharge from the Charit√© hospital, Navalny stated \\"I assert that Putin was behind the crime, and I have no other explanation for what happened. Only three people can give orders to put into action 'active measures' and use Novichok... (but) FSB director Alexander Bortnikov, foreign intelligence service head Sergey Naryshkin and the director of GRU cannot make such a decision without Putin's orders.\\" See also * Pyotr Verzilov * Anna Politkovskaya * Assassination of Boris Nemtsov * Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko * Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal * Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza  References  Category:2020 in international relations Category:Alexei Navalny Navalny, Alexei Category:August 2020 events in Russia Category:Tomsk Oblast Category:Omsk Category:Charit√© Category:August 2020 crimes Category:Violence in Russia ","title":"Poisoning of Alexei Navalny"},{"id":"65073313","text":"The blotched podge (Aporops bilinearis) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, related to the groupers and classified within the subfamily Epinephelinae of the family Serranidae.

The main concept behind zero trust, is that networked devices, such as laptops, should not be trusted by default, even if they are connected to a managed corporate network such as the corporate LAN and even if they were previously verified. In most modern enterprise environments, corporate networks consist of many interconnected segments, cloud-based services and infrastructure, connections to remote and mobile environments, and increasingly connections to non-conventional IT, such as IoT devices. The once traditional approach of trusting devices within a notional corporate perimeter, or devices connected to it via a VPN, makes less sense in such highly diverse and distributed environments. Instead, the zero trust networking approach advocates checking the identity and integrity of devices irrespective of location, and providing access to applications and services based on the confidence of device identity and device health in combination with user authentication.  Background  Many of the concepts supporting zero trust are not new. The challenges of defining the perimeter to an organisation's IT systems was highlighted by the Jericho Forum in 2003, discussing the trend of what was then coined de- perimiterisation. In 2009, Google implemented a zero trust architecture referred to as BeyondCorp, part influenced by an open-source access control project. The term zero trust has been attributed to John Kindervag, an industry analyst at Forrester, whose reporting and analysis helped crystallize zero trust concepts across IT communities. However, it would take almost a decade for zero trust architectures to become prevalent, driven in part by increased adoption of mobile and cloud services. By 2019, the UK National Technical Authority, the National Cyber Security Centre were recommending that network architects consider a zero trust approach for new IT deployments, particularly where significant use of cloud services is planned. By 2020 the majority of leading IT platform vendors, as well as cyber security providers, have well-documented examples of zero trust architectures or solutions. This increased popularization has in-turn created a range of definitions of zero trust, requiring a level of standardization by recognized authorities such as NCSC and NIST.  Principles Definitions  From late 2018, work undertaken by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and National Cyber Security Center of Excellence (NCCoE) cyber security researchers led to A NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture. The publication defines zero trust (ZT) as a collection of concepts and ideas designed to reduce the uncertainty in enforcing accurate, per-request access decisions in information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) is an enterprise‚Äôs cyber security plan that utilizes zero trust concepts and encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies. Therefore, a zero trust enterprise is the network infrastructure (physical and virtual) and operational policies that are in place for an enterprise as a product of a zero trust architecture plan. An alternative but consistent approach is taken by NCSC, in identifying the key principles behind zero trust architectures: # Single strong source of user identity # User authentication # Machine authentication # Additional context, such as policy compliance and device health # Authorization policies to access an application # Access control policies within an application  References  Category:Information technology ","title":"Zero Trust Networks"},{"id":"65073381","text":"Norman Darbyshire was the British MI6 operative who led the 1953 coup d'√©tat that overthrew Mohammed Mossadegh, the democratically elected prime minister of Iran.

Early life The Buckner Mansion in New Orleans Buckner was born on March 10, 1873 in New Orleans, Louisiana, and named after his maternal grandfather, who had died six months earlier. He was the only son of Newton Buckner (1841‚Äì1899) and Permelia Grant (n√©e Norton) Buckner (1846‚Äì1933). Among his sisters were Katherine (n√©e Buckner) Avery, Clara Norton Buckner (who died young), Minnie Norton (n√©e Buckner) Barkley, Edith Fearn (n√©e Buckner) Howard, and Frances Hewitt (n√©e Buckner) Kemper. His paternal grandparents were Henry Sullivan Buckner, a cotton broker who built a mansion at 1410 Jackson Avenue in New Orleans in 1856, and Catharine (n√©e Allan) Buckner. His aunt, Ellen Buckner, was the wife of U.S. Senator from Louisiana and Ambassador to France James B. Eustis. His maternal grandparents were Mortimer Oliver Hubbard Norton, a prominent New Orleans merchant, and Anna Richardson (n√©e Grant) Norton, a first cousin of President Ulysses S. Grant (through his father, Jesse Root Grant, Anna's half-uncle). After attending the Cathedral School of St. Paul in Garden City, Buckner graduated from Yale University with the class of 1895. He later served as president of the Yale Club of New York until 1922 when he was succeeded by George Townsend Adee. In 1928, he was elected a Fellow of the Yale Corporation, the same year he received an honorary M.A. degree from Yale. He retired from the Yale Corporation in 1940. In 1932, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Colgate University. Career After graduating from Yale, Buckner worked as a traveling salesman and insurance salesman before coming to New York City in 1901 to join the Continental Trust Company as a clerk working out of the Blair & Co. Building on Broad Street. In 1903, he was made vice president of the company and the following year, Continental Trust merged with the New York Security and Trust Company. New York Security and Trust's president, Charles S. Fairchild, became chairman of the board of trustees, and Continental's president, Otto T. Bannard, became president of the new entity, which was renamed the New York Trust Company the following year in 1905. In January 1916, Buckner succeeded Bannard as president of the New York Trust Company and Bannard became Chairman of the Board and of the Executive Committee. In 1921, New York Trust merged with Liberty National Bank of New York. Harvey Dow Gibson, the former president of Liberty, became president while Buckner succeeded Bannard as chairman of the board. The merged company had capital of $10,000,000 and \\"undivided profits and surplus of nearly $20,000,000\\" and occupied offices that had been prepared for Liberty in the American Surety Company Building at 100 Broadway. In 1919, he was named a director of Interborough Rapid Transit Company, replacing Daniel G. Reid. New York Clearing House In October 1931, Buckner was elected to succeed Jackson E. Reynolds (president of the First National Bank) as president of the New York Clearing House. He was reelected in 1932, and served in the role until October 1933 when Buckner retied (in accordance with custom), and was succeeded by George W. Davison (chairman of Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company). In 1933, the failure of the Harriman National Bank and Trust Company resulted in a government suit in equity seeking $9,375,000 against the twenty member banks of the Clearing House to compel them to keep assurances of the Clearing House to protect depositors of the Harriman bank under certain conditions. During the trial before the New York Supreme Court in 1936, Brucker (whose bank was one of eleven which paid up their share before trial), testified that \\"the refusal of two of the banks caused all of the banks to repudiate the assurances given to the Federal Controller of Currency.\\" Depression relief efforts During the Great Depression, Brucker \\"was the originator, organizer and driving force behind virtually every cooperative effort by the Wall Street bankers to meet the tide of deflation.\\" In 1931, he helped organize and served as president of the National Credit Corporation, a \\"$500,000,000 bankers' pool which was a forerunner of the RFC, he helped to save hundreds of small banks throughout the county.\\" In 1932, he was an organizer and president of the Commodities Finance Corporation, and in the same year he was \\"one of twelve bankers and industrialists serving on a committee formed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to aid the Federal Reserve System in a credit-expansion program.\\" Also in 1932, Brucker was being selected by the ten banks with deposits of more than $150,000,000 as their only nominee for membership on the new State Banking Board, Group 1, which acted as an advisory \\"cabinet\\" to the New York State Superintendent of Banks. After his death in 1942, Governor Herbert H. Lehman nominated F. Abott Goodhue (president of the Bank of Manhattan Company) to take his place. The following year, Buckner was a leader in efforts to organize cooperation of Wall Street banks and trust companies to help title and mortgage companies meet maturities of $700,000,000. He was president of the Realty Stabilization Corporation and in November 1933 when sixty-four committees of bankers and business men were appointed by the Reconstruction Corporation to speed liquidation of more than $3,000,000,000 of assets of closed national and state banks, he was named district chairman for the Second Federal Reserve District, comprising New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. Later career Buckner served as a director of the 1939 New York World's Fair held at Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park in Queens. He was also a member of the World's Fair finance committee and chairman of the World's Fair executive committee. At the time of his death, he was serving as a trustee of the estate of James A. Stillman and as chairman of the board of the New York Trust Company as well as a member of the trust committee. The company ended the post of chairman after his death. He was also connected with the Sage Land and Investment Company. His seat on the board of National Distillers Products Corporation was filled by then president of New York Trust, John E. Bierwith. Personal life On April 25, 1908, Buckner was married to Paula Kellerman in Kingston, New York. In Manhattan, the Buckners lived at 430 Park Avenue (and later at 142 East 71st Street). They were the parents of: * Caroline Buckner (1909‚Äì1972), who married Harvard graduate Owen Lloyd Winston, a son of Owen Winston of Gladstone, New Jersey, a director of Brooks Brothers. * Newton Buckner (1913‚Äì2005), a graduate of St. Paul's School and Yale who served as a Lt. Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II and as the Assistant Secretary to Gov. Thomas E. Dewey. In 1937, he married Joan Sterling, a daughter of John C. Sterling of Greenwich, Connecticut. Around 1969, he married married Dorothy Blake. Between 1927 to 1929, Buckner hired the Olmsted Brothers to design the landscape architecture at his summer residence in Fishers Island, New York. Buckner died at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan on February 25, 1942 after suffering a heart attack the day before at his office. After a service attended by former President Herbert Hoover at St. Bartholomew's Church in Manhattan, he was buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. At the time of his death, it was estimated that the entire value of his estate was $120,000, all of which was personal property. Buckner left a gross estate of $387,086, while his debts, administration and funeral expense total $1,320,240, primarily state and federal taxes. His widow died in Saratoga, California in 1971. Legacy Shortly after his death, the New York Trust Company commissioned a portrait of Buckner from Raymond P. R. Neilson, N.A. for the New York Clearing House to hang alongside the twenty- seven past presidents of the House.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. The following incidents occurred during 1978: * Earth movement was suspected in causing a gas transmission pipeline to rupture and burn near Stevenson, Washington on January 23. There were no injuries. * On January 25, a 6-inch gas main ruptured at a weld, in Stoughton, Massachusetts, causing gas to migrate under pavement & frozen earth into a building. The building later exploded, killing one person. * On February 10, a front end loader clearing snow hit a 1-inch gas riser line, in Sullivan, Indiana. The gas later exploded in the building, killing 4 people, and destroying the building. * On February 15, a gas pipeline being tested with compressed air exploded at a seam on the pipe in Cincinnati, Ohio, injuring 8. * A portion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System pipeline east of Fairbanks, Alaska was ruptured by an explosive device on February 15. Crude oil spilled in a diameter spot. * On February 26, a 16-inch Cities Service Gas pipeline ruptured near Lecompton, Kansas, causing natural gas shortages in the area. * An improperly plugged gas line leaked into service vault in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at a shopping center, overcoming 5 gas company workers on March 29. Four of the repairmen died of asphyxiation. None of the repair crew had respirators at the job site. * On April 7, 2 men performing maintenance on a town border gas meter, in Weimar, Texas. The meter exploded, injuring one of the men. A casting defect in the meter was determined to be the cause of the explosion. * A gas company crew in Mansfield, Ohio accidentally tied a high pressure gas main into a low pressure gas main on May 17. Much higher gas flames in gas appliances caused damage in 16 homes, and about 2,000 gas meters were shut off during the incident. * On June 12, a 10-inch gas pipeline was hit by a construction crew, in Kansas City, Missouri. Almost 2 hours later, escaping gas ignited, causing burns to 2 men from a crew trying to fix the pipeline leak. * A MAPCO LPG pipeline in Donnellson, Iowa ruptured from past mechanical damage and improper lowering for road improvements. The vapor cloud ignited several minutes after the rupture. Three people were killed and 2 others severely burned. The pipe failed at a dented and gouged area not seen during the original construction, or lowering for road work a few months before. A hydrostatic test on this pipeline after the accident caused failures at 2 other dented & gouged section, and 15 ERW seam failures in 117 miles. (August 4, 1978)http://www.gendisasters.com/texas/16844/fort-madison-ia-propane-pipeline-explodes-aug-1978 * On August 7, in Lafayette, Louisiana, natural gas at 15 psig pressure escaped from a corrosion leak in an inactive 1-inch steel service line and migrated beneath a concrete slab and into a building where it ignited. The resulting explosion and fire injured six persons and destroyed the building and its contents. * On August 14, a coal digging crew in Cairo, Missouri hit a MAPCO LPG pipeline with a backhoe. The gas ignited about 2 hours later, as digging crews were still working nearby. 1 worker was burned, along with the backhoe, a bulldozer, and a diesel fuel tank. * On August 28, natural gas, which had escaped from a circumferential fracture in a socket heat-fusion coupling on a 2-in. polyethylene (PE) main, operating at 40-psig pressure, migrated beneath a one-story house in Grand Island, Nebraska, exploded, and then burned. One person was injured; the house was destroyed; and three adjacent houses were damaged. * About of gasoline were spilled in Hampton, Pennsylvania on August 30. Workers boring for a sewer line had hit a fuel pipeline. Later, the 2 construction firms responsible were fined only $500 each. * A pipeline feeding a Strategic Petroleum Reserve storage cavern ruptured in Hackberry, Louisiana on September 22, causing a large fire. * A 30-inch United Texas Transmission gas pipeline in Brookside Village, Texas ruptured and exploded, killing five people, and injuring 43 others. Seven mobile homes were also destroyed. The blast was felt 35 miles away. (October 24, 1978) * On October 30, a pickup truck with 2 women inside drove into an unseen gas cloud from a leaking gas gathering pipeline in Preston, Oklahoma, triggering explosions and a fire, killing the 2 women. 3 homes were also damaged. Flames from the fire reached 200 feet high. * An Amoco crude oil pipeline leaked into the Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Area west of Farmington, Utah on November 7. About 105,000 gallons of crude were spilled. The rupture was caused by pumping against a valve that had been closed for earlier pipeline maintenance.

Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a young woman holding a bouquet of flowers. The painting is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Description  Inghram painted Flower Girl in 1846. Though the original commissioner of the painting is not known, sources speculate it was painted for Jonathan Sturges, who owned the painting when it was first displayed in 1847. The model who sat for Inghram is not known, though one source speculates it was a Marie Perkins of New Orleans. Like many contemporaneous paintings, Flower Girl depicts a street vendor. Inghram had previously rendered paintings of street vendors, but Flower is unusual among his works in that it portrays a young girl in place of a young boy. According to the Met's description of the painting, Inghram may have been inspired to paint a flower girl by a similar (and notably popular) painting of the same name by 17th century painter Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo. As far as painting elements are concerned, Inghram's Flower Girl makes effective use of colors and direction; the titular flower girl's bouquet is made up of a number of different flowers, while her gaze is fixed directly on the viewer. The girl holds in her right hand a potted fuchsia, a traditional symbol of the Roman goddess Flora and of frustrated love. Inghram's signature can be seen on the flower basket's handle. The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the painting in 1902 as a gift from William Church Osborn, a New York lawyer who would eventually become president of the Met from 1941 to 1947.

Between 500 and 1,000 civilians were murdered in was what described as Soviet reprisals against civilians for anti-communist resistance members and their military actions aimed against the Red Army. The Soviet troops arrived with 200 tanks and armored personnel carriers on 11 March 1985 in the said villages in search for the Mujahideen, rejecting an offer from the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to send their own troops to reduce the number of fatalities. According to the reports from Laghman, children were disfigured by the soldiers, while a hung baby was stabbed by a bayonet on a tree, and later its parents were killed. The Soviet troops also destroyed crops, killed the livestock, plundered houses and then withdrew. A witness described that the Soviet troops broke into the houses by throwing granades at the doors, and then alleged they are searching for weapons and ammunition, but quickly resorted to steal money and other valuables. At one point they started massively shooting people in a village. When the Mujahideen arrived to fight the Soviet troops, a clash erupted. 14 Soviet MiGs arrived and dropped 39 napalm bombs on the village, destroying houses and shops, causing fires which engulfed orchards and trees, and killed additional animals and people in the area.

She was the first female cartoonist in the Brazilian press, working for such publications as A Cigarra, O Cruzeiro, Manchete, and Tribuna da Imprensa, where she became known for her political cartoons.  Early life  Hilde Weber was born in 1913 in the German town of Waldau. Her parents separated when she was little, and she was raised by friends of the family and by her aunt Claire, who was an artist. Weber studied fine art at the Academy of Visual Arts in Hamburg, perhaps due to the influence of her aunt. In 1930, she began working as an apprentice in a graphic arts studio in Hamburg. She also worked as a teenager as an illustrator for the German newspapers Hamburger Anzeiger and Hamburger Fremdenblatt.  Career in Brazil  In 1933, with Hitler's rise to power in Germany, at only 20 years old Weber set off for Brazil in search of her father, the aviator Edmund Weber, who had moved to the country after World War I. In Rio de Janeiro, she began to work as an artist for the Di√°rios Associados media group, illustrating reports written by Rubem Braga. She also worked as an illustrator for the magazines O Cruzeiro and A Cigarra, for which she was the cover artist from 1933 to 1934. Weber also began drawing political cartoons early on, first for the Constitutional Party in its campaign against Get√∫lio Vargas. She became a permanent resident of Brazil in 1940, and in 1950 she gained Brazilian citizenship. Weber lived in S√£o Paulo from 1943 until 1950, drawing for the newspapers Folha da Manh√£ and Noite Ilustrada. She participated in the work of the Grupo Santa Helena, a group of artists who would meet at a building known as the Palacete Santa Helena. She worked in painting and ceramics at the Osirarte workshop, alongside such artists as Alfredo Volpi and M√°rio Zanini. Through work in this and other workshops, Weber contributed azulejo tilework to such buildings as the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi in Pampulha. She also worked in theatrical design, including for a production of Thieves' Carnival by Jean Anouilh. In 1950 she returned to Rio, having been hired as the cartoonist for the newspaper Tribunal da Impresa, which was run by Carlos Lacerda, a powerful figure in the conservative National Democratic Union party. There, she drew satirical caricatures related to the news of the day, frequently depicting President Get√∫lio Vargas, which took on an anti-Peronist slant under Lacerda's leadership.Santos, Rodolpho Gauthier Cardoso dos.

Joe (Navajo, born 1941) is an American academic, medical anthropologist, and fellow of the Society for Applied Anthropology. Initially trained as a nurse, she was one of the health clinic workers during Occupation of Alcatraz in 1969. She is a professor in the Departments of Family and Community Medicine and American Indian Studies at the University of Arizona. Joe was one of the inaugural board members for the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian and serves on the board of the Urban Indian Health Commission. Early life and education Jennie Rose Joe was born in 1941 in Farmington, San Juan County, New Mexico, to Pauline N. (n√©e Beyale) and Charley Joe. She grew up on the Navajo Reservation, attending Crownpoint School, and then boarded at the Riverside Indian School in Anadarko, Oklahoma. She graduated from the University of New Mexico as a public health nurse in 1964 and having been commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy Nurse Corps, completed her training in Newport, Rhode Island following her schooling. Career and activism After her graduation, Joe worked for the Indian Health Service, spending three years in northern New Mexico before transferring to North Dakota. Wanting to continue her education, Joe moved to California and completed her master's degree in public health at the University of California, Berkeley. Joe, and Dorothy Lonewolf Miller (Blackfoot) both assisted nurse Stella Leach (Colville-Oglala Lakota), who established the health clinic on Alcatraz Island during the 1969 Occupation of Alcatraz. In 1971, she was one of the women involved in the formation of the National Indian Women's Action Corps, an empowerment organization for Native American women. The organizing officers included Lonewolf Miller, president; Grace Thorpe (Sac & Fox), vice president; Leach, 2nd vice president; Woesha Cloud North (Ho-Chunk), secretary; Henrietta Whiteman (Cheyenne), treasurer; and Joe, sergeant-at-arms. After completing a second master's degree from UC Berkeley, in anthropology, Joe consulted with the California State Health Department on Indian health. While working at the California Department of Health, she assisted in founding the first program to address child abuse and neglect in the urban Indian community, which resulted in the establishment of the Urban Indian Child Resource Center of Oakland. In 1976, working part-time, Joe went on to study for her PhD in medical anthropology at UC Berkeley. Jennie Joe Noswood completed her dissertation on Navajo children with disabilities and was the first Navajo to earn a doctorate from UC Berkeley. Graduating in 1980, she worked as a research associate for the Institute for Scientific Analysis, focusing on American Indian issues. Joe then became an associate professor at UCLA in the Anthropology and American Indian Studies department. In 1986, Joe took a leave of absence from UCLA to assist the University of Arizona in developing a curriculum on disabilities and rehabilitation for indigenous people. She was involved in the research project, considered a landmark investigation into the needs of Native Americans, for the United States Department of Education. By the time the report, A Study of the Special Problems and Needs of American Indians with Handicaps Both on and off the Reservation, was completed in 1987, she had been hired as the co-director of the Native American Research and Training Center at the University of Arizona. By 1990, Joe was teaching as an associate professor and sole director of the Research and Training Center for the university. That year she was selected by the Smithsonian Institution to serve as one of 12 members on the inaugural board of the National Museum of the American Indian, which was to be constructed. Joe's work as a medical anthropologist involves evaluating health from a cultural perspective, including reluctance to remove traditional foods from the diet, taboos regarding touching preventing breast examinations, among other practices, which may result in minority populations receiving disparate health care services. Among her topics of interest are diabetes, alcoholism and substance abuse, and the impact of forced removal and location on indigenous populations. In addition to her work in the Family and Community Medicine Department, Joe teaches in the faculty of American Indian Studies and is an elected fellow of the Society for Applied Anthropology. She serves on the board of the Urban Indian Health Commission, an initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Indian Health Institute of Seattle.

It is native to the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. This species was first described in 1858 by the British naturalist James Scott Bowerbank, who gave it the name Halichondria variantia. It was later moved to the genus Biemna and is the type species of the genus. The type locality is Tenby, Wales. Description Biemna variantia is an encrusting sponge forming small cushions seldom more than across, thick in the middle and thinner near the edge. The surface is covered with small conical peaks and has a spiky appearance due to spicule fibres which support the surface. The oscula are irregularly scattered across the surface. Sometimes the cushions are plate-like, cup or fan-shaped, and older individuals may have protuberances and appear lumpy or shaggy. The colour of this sponge is yellowish, beige or light brown, the texture is soft, and the tissues fragile and crumbly. It may be confused with Dysidea fragilis, but that species is whiter and lacks the megascleres and microscleres present in Biemna variantia. Distribution and habitat Biemna variantia is found in the Arctic Ocean and northern Atlantic Ocean, from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Greenland to the Barents Sea and the North Sea. It is also known from the English Channel and as far south as Portugal, the Canary Islands and the Alboran Sea, at the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. It grows on vertical rock faces where there is moderate water movement, under boulders and on stones, gravel and mud, at depths varying from the intertidal zone to . This sponge tolerates brackish water and is not uncommon in estuaries. Ecology Like other sponges, Biemna variantia draws in water through small pores, filters out organic particles less than 3Œºm in diameter, and expels the water through the oscula; its diet consists mostly of bacteria, unicellular algae, and organic debris. The sponge is a hermaphrodite and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Male and female gametes are produced at different times, so self-fertilisation does not occur. After fertilisation, the embryos are brooded inside the sponge, and when they reach the last embryonic stage, they pass out through the oscula into the water column. They drift with the plankton, and after a few days, they settle on the seabed, attach themselves to the substrate and become juvenile sponges. Asexual reproduction is via budding, or by fragmentation, a process that occurs when pieces of sponge become detached.

By May 2018, the project had taken the name Midtown Union. On May 30, 2019, Invesco announced that they planned to be a major tenant in the new development. Per their announcement, they would occupy about half of the total office space in the development. On October 2 of that year, the office building at the site was demolished to make way for the development. Several weeks earlier, on September 10, the Midtown Development Review Committee had approved a revised plan for the project put forward by developer Granite Properties. Construction officially began on November 26, 2019, with a groundbreaking ceremony occurring on December 9. Brasfield & Gorrie are serving as contractors for the project. The development is expected to begin opening in 2022.  Site and structures  The development will consist of a 26 story tower housing 600,000 square feet of office space, an 18 story residential building containing 355 apartments, and a 12 story hotel. Additionally, the development will feature 30,000 square feet of retail space.

Sa'id was the scion of a prominent family of the Bahila tribe: his father, Salm ibn Qutayba, had served both the Umayyads and the Abbasids as governor of Basra, and his grandfather had been the distinguished general Qutayba ibn Muslim. Several of Sa'id's brothers and uncles also held high office. In 776/7, he campaigned against Yusuf al-Barm in Khurasan. Sa'id was a close friend and boon-companion of Caliph al-Hadi (). He was with al-Hadi at Jurjan when news came of the death of his father, Caliph al-Mahdi, and al-Hadi's accession; together the two rode for Baghdad, where al-Hadi ascended the throne. According to an account preserved by al-Tabari, Sa'id held the highest rank at court under al-Hadi, succeeding his own brother Ibrahim. Under Harun al-Rashid () he was appointed to several provincial governorships. He was appointed to the Jazira in 796/7, and was governor of Arminiya in 799, during a Khazar raid into Abbasid territory. One account holds that the raid was provoked by Sa'id executing al-Munajjim al- Sulami‚Äîprobably the local ruler of Derbent‚Äîprompting his son to go to the Khazars and ask for their help in obtaining revenge. The Khazars defeated Sa'id, who fled before them. It was only after Harun sent Khuzayma ibn Khazim and Yazid ibn Mazyad to the province that the Khazars were expelled and order restored. He also served as governor of Mosul, Tabaristan, and Sind (where he sent his brother Kathir as his deputy). In 807, Harun appointed him as commandant of the fortress town of Mar'ash, at the border with the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines raided the area and took several captives, but Sa'id did not move to oppose them. He is last attested in al-Tabari in 808/9.

Early life R√≥bert Imre M√°rkus was born in Budapest, Hungary on 8 October 1924. Both of his parents were Jews with strong ties to Christianity. His father, Gy√∂z√∂ (Victor) M√°rkus (1897‚Äì1971), was the director of a heavy engineering firm which had been founded by Robert's grandfather M√°rkus Lajos, originally a locksmith. Robert's mother, Lili (Lily) Elek (1900‚Äì1962), was the daughter of the manager of an enormous forest in Osijek, modern-day Croatia. She was an internationally recognized ceramicist. Robert's father had converted to Lutheranism as a young man, but later regretted his decision and applied for readmission to the synagogue. M√°rkus was baptized in the Lutheran church as an infant. Education M√°rkus attended the √Åld√°s elementary school in Budapest, and later boarding schools in Lausanne and Bern. His family emigrated to England in 1939 and settled in Glossop, where his father and uncle had arranged with the local MP Hugh Molson, Baron Molson to establish Ferrostatics, a small engineering factory at Hollingworth. The factory was soon producing precision machine tools for the manufacture of Spitfires, which enabled the family to avoid internment as enemy aliens on the Isle of Man. After the war, Ferrostatics continued with precision engineering for major companies, such as Imperial Chemical Industries, and was eventually sold to the Chloride Electrical Storage Company. M√°rkus completed his high school education at Kingsmoor School, Glossop. He subsequently enrolled at the University of Manchester as a chemistry student. M√°rkus had originally sought to study philosophy, while his father wanted him to become and engineer and assume control of the family business, and chemistry thus became a compromise choice. At the university he came under the influence of Professor of Physical Chemistry Michael Polanyi. As a chemist M√°rkus was exempted from military service during World War II, and instead served as a works chemist at a The Co-operative Group margarine factory in accordance with the wartime Essential Work Order. After the war, M√°rkus began studying philosophy at the University of Manchester. Here befriended his professor Dorothy Emmet, who had a major influence on him. His 1948 MA on Samuel Alexander, and his 1950 PhD on Cartesianism, were both supervised by Emmet. At Manchester, M√°rkus belonged to a circle of future prominent intellectuals, which included Walter Johannes Stein, Herbert McCabe and Eric John. The circle was characterized by secularism and radical socialist ideas. Several members of the group were Marxists, most notably his close friend Walter Stein, and throughout his life, M√°rkus would belong to the political left. Among the members of Markus' intellectual circle was the history student Margaret Catherine Bullen, with whom Marcus would eventually marry. One of the members of the group was the \\"very liberal\\" Roman Catholic priest Father Vincent Whelan. Seeing the need for Christian conscience in the aftermath of the invention of nuclear weapons, M√°rkus received instruction as a Catholic from Father Whelan in 1946. His parents and brother followed him into conversion. Together with Walter Stein, Willy Schenk and Louis Allen, Robert founded the journal Humanitas, which aimed to united Catholic values and social reform through radical change of both the Church and secular society. Together with Stein, M√°rkus wrote Nuclear Warfare and the Christian Conscience (1949), which argued in favor of nuclear disarmament. In the summer of 1949, M√°rkus went on a pilgrimage to Rome with his close friend Father Wheelan. M√°rkus envisioned a more diverse Church where the Vatican had less authority, and would later rejoice over the radical changes implemented at the Second Vatican Council under Pope John XXIII. Career With his friend McCabe, M√°rkus left Manchester for Oxford in 1950, where he joined the Dominican Order at Blackfriars, Oxford. It was at this time was he changed his name to Robert Austin Markus. Forbidden by his novice master from reading philosophy during his first year at Blackfriars, Markus was encouraged to read the scriptural commentaries of Augustine. The study of Augustine would later become central to his scholarly work. In 1954, Markus left Blackfriars for Birmingham, where he found work as a librarian. In 1955, Markus moved to Liverpool, where he worked at the university library under the librarian and scholar Kenneth Povey. Povey encourated Markus to continue his research and from 1958, Markus was lecturer, and later senior lecturer and reader, in the department of medieval history at the University of Liverpool. At the time the department was headed by Christopher N. L. Brooke. At the time Markus lectured on a number of subjects, including Bede, and on ancient and medieval political thought. By 1960, Markus had become greatly interested in Pope Gregory I, and was offered to supervise a Special Subject on him. Among the early students to follow Markus' special subject on Gregory the Great was Ian Kershaw. In the 1960s, Markus befriended fellow historian Peter Brown, with whom he established a close friendship. Along with Brown, Markus played a decisive role in establishing Late Antiquity as a distinct period in European history. His reading of William Frend The Donatist Church greatly influenced him. While Frend argued that the Donatists represented the aspirations of the Berbers of North Africa, Markus agreed with Brown that they rather represented the pre-Constantian uncentralised traditions of the African Church. In subsequent years, Markus studied the early history of Christianity as a force in the social and political history of ancient Rome. His first monograph, Saeculum: History and Society in the Theology of Saint Augustine (1970), saw Augustine as a dissenter from the triumphalisism of the post-Constantinian Christianity. In his Christianity in the Roman World (1974), Markus subjected the social and cultural history of Christianity to further study, and examined how it came to be the state religion of the Roman Empire. Markus argued that the growth of Christianity was largely achieved through its gradual incorporation of classical values, which made it more acceptable to Roman elites. In 1974, Markus was appointed Chair of Medieval History at the University of Nottingham. By this time, he had established himself as leading authority on the history of the early Church. During his period at Nottingham, Markus contributed greatly making the Nottingham Department of Classics a leading institution in its field. He was President of the Ecclesiastical History Society from 1978 to 1979. Markus took an early retirement from the University of Nottingham in 1982. He would rater classify his early retirement as the best decision of his life apart from marrying his wife. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1985. From 1986 to 1987 he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study. He was Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Catholic University of America in 1988. Although retiring from university duties apart from a few guest lectures, Markus continued researching and writing. His The End of Ancient Christianity (1990) examined how Roman culture eroded from the time of Augustine to that of Pope Gregory the Great. Wolf Liebeschuetz has described The End of Ancient Christianity as Markus' masterpiece. It was followed by Gregory the Great and His World (1997).

O'Brien (January 21, 1842 ‚Äì November 1, 1902) was an American soldier who fought with the Union Army in the American Civil War. O'Brien received his country's highest award for bravery during combat, the Medal of Honor, for actions taken on July 3, 1863 during the Battle of Gettysburg. Biography O'Brien was born in Calais, Maine in 1842. His family moved to Saint Anthony Falls, Minnesota in 1857. He enlisted in the 1st Minnesota Infantry, Company E, as a private on August 13, 1861. With this regiment, O'Brien saw combat in multiple engagements, including the Battle of Ball's Bluff, the Battle of Harpers Ferry, the Siege of Yorktown (1862), the Battle of Malvern Hill, and many others. He was also involved with the Battle of Gettysburg from July 2 to 3, 1863. On the second day, O'Brien helped rescue a fallen soldier and brought him back to safety. On July 3, during Pickett's Charge, O'Brien took up the colors of his regiment when the initial color-bearer was shot down, and in doing so received two wounds in a bayonet charge that followed to bring the flag back to safety. He received the Medal of Honor for these actions. Following Gettysburg, O'Brien fought at the Second Battle of Deep Bottom where he was shot in the right shoulder and lung. The shot passed through his body cleanly, but the wound festered for nineteen years before a surgeon removed twenty-two pieces of bone and bullet fragment from the area. Medal of Honor citationPersonal life After the war, O'Brien married Emma Sinclair with whom they had one son. O'Brien worked as a government pension agent in St. Louis, where he lived for the rest of his life. O'Brien died of pneumonia in St. Louis, Missouri, at the age of 61.

Stonegate has been an important street for many centuries, and a Mulberry Hall existed on the site by 1372, housing the prebend of North Newbald. In the mid-15th century, the house was demolished and a new one built. Some modern sources give the date of rebuilding as 1434, and this date is now painted onto the building. The new structure was a two-storey timber-framed building, running from the corner of Stonegate and Little Stonegate, and stretching along Stonegate to cover three building plots. In about 1574, a third storey was added to the building. The whole structure was widened to the rear, by a few feet, and a new two-storey wing added to the rear of this, with a large kitchen on the ground floor. In the 18th-century, the part of the building next to Little Stonegate was rebuilt, and has since been a separate structure, 15 Stonegate. The remainder was divided into two tenements with shops below. In the 1950s, the whole remaining part of the house was converted into a single large shop, a china and glass retailer also named Mulberry Hall. This closed in 2016, since when it has been occupied by the first UK branch of K√§the Wohlfahrt, a year-round Christmas shop. Although the building has been heavily altered over the years, it retains a jettied front with exposed timber-framing, and original 16th- and 17th-century windows on the upper floors. One window frame was formerly inscribed with the date \\"1574\\", although this is no longer visible. To the rear, part of the structure is timber-framed and jettied, although the north- east bay was rebuilt in brick in about 1700. The first floor has extensive 17th-century wood panelling, and there is also a staircase dating from about 1700. The building is owned by the Sinclair family, a well known York family.

They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after Escobar's death, and hence left on the untended estate. By 2007, the animals had multiplied to 16 and had taken to roaming the area for food in the nearby Magdalena River. In 2013, the National Geographic Channel produced a documentary about them titled Cocaine Hippos. As of early 2014, 40 hippos were reported to exist in Puerto Triunfo, Antioquia from the original four belonging to Escobar, English translation at Google Translate and in 2018 the growing population was estimated at 50‚Äì70. In December 2019, it was estimated that there were 65‚Äì80 individuals with their range covering almost in Antioquia, Bol√≠var, Boyac√°, Cundinamarca and Santander; it is expected that the population will increase to 150 individuals within a decade and that the range eventually could cover more than . Population projections estimate that there could be thousands within a few decades. Being non-native introductions, most conservationists considered them problematic and invasive in Colombia, as they have the potential to change the ecosystems, feeding heavily on plants and displacing native species like the West Indian manatee, Neotropical otter, spectacled caiman and turtles. The critically endangered Dahl's toad-headed turtle and Magdalena River turtle are largely restricted to the Magdalena River basin, as are many threatened fish. In 2020, a study showed that there was an increase in the nutrient levels and cyanobacteria in Colombian lakes inhabited by hippos. Cyanobacteria can cause toxic algae blooms and die-offs of aquatic fauna. Despite the limited magnitude of the observed change, it was noticeable since the species' population was still quite small. Additionally, they can represent a serious threat to fishers and other locals. There have been attacks on humans, but as of 2017 nobody had been killed or seriously injured by the Colombian hippos. In contrast to the opposition by most conservationists, some ecologists have argued that they should remain and might even have a positive effect on the local environment. It has been suggested that the nutrients they introduce to the water and the occasional fish kills caused by them are overall positive, but this was based on a study in their native Africa. Alternatively, the introduced hippos could be a form of Pleistocene rewilding project, replacing species like Toxodon that became extinct in prehistoric times, but Pleistocene rewilding itself is highly controversial. Others have argued that the Colombian hippos should be regarded as a safe population, isolated from the threats faced by African hippos, and that they could be beneficial to the local ecotourism industry. In 2009, two adults and one calf left their herd and, after attacking humans and killing cattle, one of the adults (called \\"Pepe\\") was killed by hunters under authorisation of the local authorities. When a photo of the dead hippo became public, it caused considerable controversy among animal rights groups both within the country and abroad, and further plans of culling ceased. Alternative methods have been considered, but they are unproven, or difficult and expensive. A wild male hippo was caught, castrated and released again, but it cost about US$50,000. As of 2020, there were no plans by the local government on managing the population, but further studies on their effect on the habitat have been initiated. Because of the fast-growing population, conservationists have recommended that a management plan needs to be rapidly developed.

LEAPER (Leveraging endogenous ADAR for programmable editing of RNA) is a genetic engineering technique in molecular biology by which RNA can be edited. The technique relies on engineered strands of RNA to recruit native ADAR enzymes to swap out different compounds in RNA. Developed by researchers at Peking University in 2019, the technique, some have claimed, is more efficient than the CRISPR gene editing technique. Initial studies have claimed that editing efiiciencies of up to 80% can be achieved. Synopsis The technique employs short engineered ADAR-recruiting RNAs (arRNAs) to recruit native ADAR1 or ADAR2 enzymes. These enzymes then change a specific adenosine to an inosine on a transcribed RNA. This results in a change in which protein is synthesized during translation. History The technique was discovered by a team of researchers at Peking University in Beijing, China. The discovery was announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology in July 2019. Applications Chinese researchers have utilized LEAPER to restore functional enzyme activity in cells from patients with Hurler syndrome. They have claimed that LEAPER could have the potential to treat almost half of all known hereditary disorders. Editing efficiencies of up to 80% can be achieved when LEAPER is delivered via a plasmid or viral vector or as a synthetic oligonucleotide. Comparison to CRISPR LEAPER is analogous to CRISPR Cas-13 in that it targets RNA before proteins are synthesized. However, LEAPER is simpler and more efficient as it only requires arRNA, rather than Cas and a guide RNA. According to the researchers who developed LEAPER, it has the potential to be easier and more precise than any CRISPR technique. LEAPER also eliminates health concerns and technical barriers arising from the introduction of exogenous proteins. It has also been called more ethical as it does not change DNA and thus does not result in heritable changes, unlike methods using CRISPR Cas-9.

Kafafi is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, The Optical Society, Materials Research Society and SPIE.  Early life and education  Kafafi is from Egypt. She has said that she became interested in chemistry whilst she was at high school, and that her science teacher frequently referred to her as The Chemist. She started her undergraduate degree in chemistry at the University of Houston, where she minored in mathematics. She moved to the Rice University for her graduate studies, where she worked on low-temperature spectroscopy. At Rice University Kafafi was friends with Marilyn E. Jacox. After completing her doctorate, Kafafi moved to Cairo, where she was appointed Assistant Professor.  Research and career  In 1986 whilst on a sabbatical from her academic position Kafafi visited the United States, where she learned about a job that was open in the Optical Sciences Division at the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Kafafi eventually joined NRL, where she established the organic optoelectronics section. Here she worked on nonlinear optical materials and colour centre lasers. She transitioned from chemistry to materials science and eventually ended up in physics, studying the properties of OLEDs. Kafafi spent over twenty years working at the NRL, during which time OLED displays found their way into televisions and mobile phones. In 2007 Kafafi was appointed to the National Science Foundation Director of the Division of Materials Research, during which time she over saw a billion dollar budget. She was the first woman to hold such a position. In 2010 Kafafi returned to Egypt, where she looked to develop partnerships that promoted solar energy across the country. Kafafi joined the faculty at Lehigh University in 2008, where she was made Distinguished Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Here she has developed metallic plasmonic nanostructures that can increase light absorption and the efficiency of photovoltaics. These nanostructures make it possible to increase the optical absorption of the active layer of photovoltaics without increasing the layer thickness, allowing for improved device performance without compromising the flexibility or weight. From 2011 to 2016 Kafafi served as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Photonics for Energy. In 2014 Kafafi was made the inaugural editor of the journal Science Advances.

The range was made of the ABF and the ABG. Renault also developed a bus/coach called the ZP using the same cabin. History By 1934, the French government established various restrictions on commercial vehicles, among them a decree that imposed limits on design, including: the overall width of a road vehicle should not exceed 2 metres 35 centimetres and the overall length 10 metres. The overall length of a tractor- trailer unit should not exceed 12 metres. The gross combined weight of any laden vehicle should not exceed 15 tonnes, and the load on any axle 10 tonnes. The average weight per metre of length of any vehicle should not exceed 4 tonnes in the case of vehicles with two axles. As a result of these restrictions, Renault began to introduce forward control designs, replacing the normal control (conventional cabin) it had been using in the early 1930s. In September 1934, the company unveiled a forward control truck for 1935 at the Paris Salon, the ABF (5-tonne payload truck), and announced a second, the ABG tractor unit (hauling capacity of up to 10 tonnes) , which was unveiled at the Brussels Salon in November of that year. ABF The ABF was the first forward control truck from Renault. In 1937, the French military commissioned a couple of ABFs adapted to use natural gas as part of a push for alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels. In the early 1940s ABFs were fitted with a trolley pole and electrical equipment on front, as part of an experiment on electrical trucks. The ABF was put out of production in late 1937 and replaced by the AGK. ABG The ABG was primarily aimed to be used as a tractor unit. The Societ√© Algerienne des Transports Tropicaux, a company focused on trans- Saharan travel, commissioned ABGs bodied as mixed vehicles with a second row of seats in the cabin, which was lengthened accordingly, making them able to take three to four passengers. The ABG was retired from Renault's lineup in late 1937. Technical details The ABF and the ABG have the same inline-four engines: a 5.9-litre petrol unit and an 8.4-litre diesel, both delivering at 2,000 and 1,600 rpm respectively. The ABF has servomechanical brakes and the ABG has both servomechanical and air brakes. The suspension on both trucks is by leaf springs. Wheelbases are 2.4 metres (ABG), 2.6 metres (ABF short), and 3.4 metres (ABF long). The trucks have double wheels on the rear axle. Their gearbox is 4-speed manual. The maximum gross combined weight ratings are 6 tonnes for the ABF and 13 tonnes for the ABG (tractor unit with towed cargo), with 5 and 10 tonnes payload respectively. Renault ZP Renaults ZP short and long. The cabin design for the ZP was also used by the ABF long single seat. The Renault ZP is a bus/coach introduced by Renault at the same time that the ABx range, using the same cabin. It was initially powered by the same petrol engine mounted by the ABx, delivering a power between and at 2,400 rpm. For 1936 it added the ABx diesel engine, tuned for ‚Äì at 1,600 rpm. There were two lengths avalaible for the ZP, with a maximum length of 8.57 metres. The ZP short has 23‚Äì28 passenger seats and the long 31‚Äì36. The suspension of both is made up of leaf springs with hydraulic dampers. The gearbox is a 4-speed manual unit. By 1937, the ZP adopted the AGK's cabin. Gasifier- equipped ZPs were used for urban transit services. It was also used by trans- Saharan transport services. After World War II, Renault introduced a ZP-based bus/coach called 215 D (later renamed as the R-series). It was produced from 1946 to 1949.

Hendee, and Mary Ann King Lambert in 1872 to cast ballots as American citizens and women in Portland, Oregon. She was one of the first Black women to publicly agitate for women suffrage west of the Mississippi.  Life  Beatty was born Mary Laurinda Jane Smith in February 1834 near Louisville, Kentucky. Her parents, James Madison Smith and Catharine Ann Philips Smith, were identified on their marriage certificate as ‚Äúfree persons of color.‚Äù Mary Laurinda Jane Smith married James William Beatty on January 8, 1850. The couple left Kentucky shortly thereafter, in the wake of newly-passed state-level restrictions on Blacks, as well as passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. They settled briefly in Hanover, Indiana, leaving Indiana too after the Indiana constitution restricted Black immigration. The couple moved steadily westward over the next decade, before settling in Portland, Oregon in 1864. Despite the discrimination they faced in Portland, including the state‚Äôs Black Exclusion Laws of 1857 and the Poll Tax of 1862, Mary and James Beatty established successful livelihoods in Portland: Mary worked as a dressmaker, while James worked as a painter. Despite Oregon‚Äôs prohibition on Blacks owning property, the Beattys owned substantial real estate holdings.  Politics  Throughout their lives, the couple worked for equal rights. James Beatty directed the city‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrand Ratification Jubilee‚Äù for the Fifteenth Amendment and supported efforts to hire Black police officers. He was a member of the Colored Lincoln Republican Club. On November 5, 1872, Mary Beatty joined Abigail Scott Duniway, Maria P. Hendee and Mary Ann King Lambert in visiting Portland‚Äôs Morrison Precinct to cast ballots, As the suffrage publication The New Northwest observed, ‚ÄúThus was woman suffrage vindicated in the persons of Mrs. A.J. Duniway, a colored and two white women.‚Äù A few months later, Mary Beatty ‚Äúread an essay proving that the colored women are awake to their own interests‚Äù at the 1873 Oregon State Woman Suffrage Association. Mary Beatty did not live to see the partial victory for Oregon‚Äôs woman suffrage in 1912, after five failed attempts. And it would not be until passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 that racially discriminatory policies preventing people of color from exercising their right to vote were ended, fulfilling some part of the promise of full suffrage. Still, Mary Beatty was a forerunner of Black suffrage activists who agitated for the vote in the Portland area during the important mobilization in 1912, including Hattie Redmond and Lizzie Weeks.

The Iroquois nations, which had an egalitarian society, were visited by early feminists and suffragists, such as Lydia Maria Child, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Lucretia Mott, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. These women discussed how Native American women had authority in their own cultures at various feminist conventions and also in the news. Native American women became a symbol for some suffrage activists. However, other white suffragists actively excluded Native American people from the movement. When the Nineteenth Amendment was passed in 1920, suffragist Zitkala-Sa commented that Native American still had more work to do in order to vote. It was not until 1924 that many Native Americans could vote under the Indian Citizenship Act. In many states, there were additional barriers to Native American voting rights.  Influences on women's suffrage movement  Sacajawea (Lemhi Shoshone) statue in Portland Early feminist movements in the United States were influenced by Native women, especially Iroquois women. In 1848, Lucretia Mott and her husband visited the Seneca people where she was able to see women living in a more equal society than in her own. When Mott visited friends in New York to plan the Seneca Falls Convention, she shared the stories about the Seneca's more equal treatment of women and their participatory role in tribal government. Iroquois women headed the family structures and both nominated and monitored the work of leaders in their communities. Mott also saw women in these communities work towards greater independence in their own lives. Matilda Joslyn Gage was also influenced by the structure of society in the Iroquois. Gage believed that Native societies lived in a way that was a model for creating a lasting peace in the world. She wrote articles in the New York Evening Post praising Native cultures like the Iroquois for the contributions of women to their society and their ability to make important decisions for the community. Lydia Maria Child also saw the social structure of Native Americans as \\"an alternative to patriarchy,\\" and Elizabeth Cady Stanton referenced the culture of the Iroquois as being \\"matriarchal.\\" Savagery to \\"Civilization\\" \\\\- drawn by Joseph Keppler, 1914 Bear-clan mother of the Mohawk Nation, Louise McDonald Herne, stated that it was Native women who \\"showed white women what freedom and liberty really looked like.\\" Alice Fletcher shared stories about the equal rights of women in Native American cultures at the International Council of Women in 1888. At the National Council of Women in 1891, Stanton again brought up the authority women held in Iroquois culture. Chair of the Oregon Equal Suffrage Association (OESA), Eva Marie Dye, worked to get Sacagawea (Lemhi Shoshone) recognized as a national hero. Dye's work at creating a statue in Sacagawea's honor was central to much of the suffrage work in Oregon. The National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) held its national convention at the unveiling of the statue in Portland in 1905.  Native American suffragists  Marie L. Baldwin (M√©tis Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians) Cayuga physician, Peter Wilson, in 1866 urged members of the New York Historical Society to support women's right to vote. In Oklahoma, Native Americans and non-native suffragists met in 1904 to begin working with one another. The Oklahoma Woman Suffrage Association (OWSA) reached out to Chickasaw people in their own language, encouraging them to support women's suffrage. Ha pe kana Chahta micha Chikasha aeina ma, 1910 Marie Louise Bottineau Baldwin (M√©tis Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians) participated in a 1913 suffrage parade in Washington, choosing not to create a float using stereotypical images of Native women, but instead marching as \\"modern women.\\" After the 19th Amendment was ratified on August 18, 1920, Zitkala-Sa (Yankton Sioux) reminded white women that Native American women still were not able to legally vote. Zitkala- Sa lobbied the United States Congress to allow suffrage for Native American people in 1924.  Voting rights  Alaska's Territorial Legislature provided the right to vote to Alaska Natives, in 1915, as long as they gave up their tribal customs and traditions. In 1924, Native Americans were recognized as United States citizens through the Snyder Act. However, many states started extending policies designed to disenfranchise Black voters on Native American voters. Arizona and New Mexico did not allow Native Americans to vote until 1948. Utah allowed Indigenous people to vote in 1957. When the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, Native Americans had better access to voting rights, though there were still unique challenges that Native people faced.  Exclusion  Many suffrage groups did not work on reaching out to Native American women. Some white suffragists like Carrie Chapman Catt felt that white women should get the right to vote before Native women could get equal suffrage. Anna Howard Shaw also believed that Native Americans did not deserve to vote. She spoke out against giving the vote to Native people in South Dakota during the 1890s.

The motorcycles were manufactured in a factory located at 25 Ulica Mi≈Ñska in the Warsaw district of Groch√≥w. History The Warszawskich Zak≈Çad√≥w Naprawy Samochod√≥w () was established in 1947 by the amalgamation of the state-run Zak≈Çady UrzƒÖdze≈Ñ Transportowego No. 2 () and the Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady Samochodowych No. 2 (). Amongst other activities, the workshop produced SHL M04 motorcycles for SHL from pre-war spares from Huta Ludwik√≥w and DKW engines. Later the engine designed for the Sok√≥≈Ç 125 cc was used. The factory turned exclusively to motorcycle production in 1951 and the name was changed to Warszawska Fabryka Motocykli (WFM). The first motorcycles were delivered in 1952. Initially they produced 125 cc motorcycles for Wytw√≥rni Sprzƒôtu Komunikacyjnego of Psie Pole and SHL of Kielce. From 1955, WFM produced their own branded motorcycles and scooters and also supplied engines and components to other motorcycle manufacturers. Wac≈Çaw Laskowski was the factory director for many years. On 1 January 1965,Jacek Urba≈Ñczyk, Naprawa motocykli WFM, 1966 the WFM plant was merged with the neighbouring Polish Optical Works (PZO) and production of motorcycles was gradually phased out. The WFM machinery was taken over by PZO, who continued to produce engines and spare parts. Models Initial production was manufacturing the M04 for SHL, 27,000 machines were built between 1952 and June 1954. This model was superseded by the SHL M05, which had telescopic forks. 12,500 units of the M05 were built. WFM M06 1964 WFM M06-S34 The 1955 M06 was the first model branded as a WFM. It was a development of the SHL M05 and used the same 123 cc S-01 engine. The cycle parts were copied from the SHL M05 model, which had swinging arm rear suspension. An export model was produced with a battery, electric horn and chromed wheel rims. The domestic model received these refinements in 1957. Upgrades to the carburettor and cylinder head were made in 1958. A new more powerful engine, the S-34, was fitted in 1963. By the time production ended in March 1966, around 600,000 motorcycles of this model had been produced. WFM M16 Tarpan A successor for the M06 was planned in 1962. It was to be a new design and able to compete with machines from Jawa and MZ. The machine had a spine frame and leading link forks. A new 175 cc engine was designed which featured a 5 speed gearbox, but never got off the drawing board. A few prototypes were made using the existing S32 engine, but the machine never went into production. WFM Osa WFM Osa M52 In 1955, WFM designed 3 prototype scooters, all named after insects: ≈ªuk (beetle), BƒÖk (bee) and Osa (wasp). There was resistance from the authorities towards what they viewed as a \\"ideologically hostile\\" product, and pre- production models of the Osa weren't produced until February 1959. The scooter used a 148 cc single-cylinder, two-stroke engine, designated S 06, which WFM had been supplying to SHL. The machine used 14 inch wheels. The machine went into full production as the Osa M50. In 1962 the Osa M52 was introduced. This was fitted with the 175 cc S 33 engine. Much of the production of the M52 was exported to India. Production of the M50 was stopped in 1963 and the M52 in 1965. Competitions WFM entered factory teams in a number of ISDT events between 1956 and 1963, including the 1959 17th International Tatra Rally, the 1960 XXXV Sze≈õciodni√≥wce FIM in Bad Aussee, Austria and the 1961 Scottish Sze≈õciodni√≥wce. Both 125 cc motorcyles and Osa scooters were used.

The originator of the project was W≈Çodzimierz GƒÖsiorek, who owned the WFM trademark through the Motor Klub Wawer. The motorcycle was a modification of the Minsk Lider, and was available in 50 cc and 125 cc versions.

She is one of Brazil's first deaf female comic creators. Ju Loyola gained international recognition for her work on \\"silent manga\\", a manga genre where the lack of dialogue allows the work to be understood regardless of the reader's native language or level of literacy. Since 2015, she has been participating in the Silent Manga Audition, an international competition of the silent comic format.Lopes, Danielly (2019). Imagin√°rio. Para√≠ba: Marca de Fantasia. pp. 57‚Äì80  Early life  Ju Loyola was born in S√£o Paulo in 1979. Her mother, Regina Mara Loiola de Paula, contracted the rubella virus while she was pregnant with Juliana, contributing to the artist being born deaf. She was diagnosed when she was 3 years old. Ju Loyola became interested in illustration as a young child, at around 7 or 8 years old. Her early inspirations included Garfield by Jim Davis, Fido Dido by Joanna Ferrone and Sue Rose, and Strawberry Shortcake by Muriel Fahrion. She read such comics as Turma da M√¥nica by Mauricio de Sousa and The Phantom and Mandrake the Magician by Lee Falk. Later in life she became interested in Japanese anime and manga, including Saint Seiya and Sailor Moon. These works inspired her to pursue a career in comics. Ju Loyola began her education in a traditional school. In 1991, she enrolled in a special school for the deaf, focused on teaching Brazilian Sign Language. She had trouble adapting and later returned to traditional schooling.  Career  Ju Loyola first considered pursuing a career as a cartoonist during her teenage years, but at the time she believed that it was necessary to be fluent in spoken Portuguese to write dialogue for comics, so she put her dream on hold. Between 1998 and 1999, she worked as a denture technician, but felt unfulfilled and later abandoned her dental career. In 2003, Ju Loyola graduated with a graphic design degree from the Pan-American School of Art and Design in S√£o Paulo, and began working as a freelance cartoonist. Among her most notable freelance work during this period are contributions to the manga-style webcomic Combo Rangers in 2002. In 2007, she worked as an animator and collator for Lightstar Studios, including on the animated film Rio 2096: A Story of Love and Fury, which was directed by Luiz Bolognesi. However, she became increasingly interested in comics after attending the Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos and discovering silent manga, a dialogue-less comics format that tells stories without speech. She subsequently left her career as an animator to focus on comics. An important aspect of Loyola's career is her participation in the Silent Manga Audition, an international competition in which she has received several honors, including an honorable mention and the 2016 SMAC! Editors Award. While Loyola has said that her deafness no longer impedes her ability to create comics thanks to the silent comics medium, she still continues to experience prejudice and discrimination as a person with disabilities and a woman in the industry.

By the early 1860s, she had become a popular performer at music halls in London. She wrote the lyrics of, and performed, one of several versions of a song, \\"No Irish Need Apply\\", adapting a tune performed earlier by Tom Hudson as \\"The Spider and the Fly\\". Similar songs entitled \\"No Irish Need Apply\\" were sung in the United States at around the same time and it is unclear whether or not Mrs Phillips' song was the original.\\"No Irish need apply\\", Folk Song and Music Hall. Retrieved 25 August 2020 Richard J. Jensen, \\"\\"No Irish Need Apply\\": A Myth of Victimization\\", Journal of Social History 36.2 (2002) 405-429 Mrs Phillips' version alluded to the supposed ban on Irish men working at the Great Exhibition in 1851. One version of Mrs Phillips' lyrics included these verses: :You talk about your soldiers, now tell me if you can, :If the bravest of them all are not Irish men, :In Russia, and in China too, and India by the by, :You never say when you want men, no Irish need apply, :For if you want good soldiers, listen to me by the by, :Would you ever have a Wellington if no Irish need apply. :: :Of generals and statesmen, old Ireland can boast, :Her poets too, 'tis well known to you, are universal toasts, :There‚Äôs Campbell, Moore and Lover, and Goldsmith by the by, :You would not get their equals if no Irish need apply, :You talk about your country, but you know tis all my eye, :For the best feather in your cap is when Irish do apply. Impresario Charles Morton described her as a \\"rich-toned acting vocalist\\". Charles Morton, Sixty years' stage service, being a record of the life of Charles Morton, \\"The father of the halls.\\", 1905, p.34 A review in The Era in 1872 said of her: \\"This lady has been long before the public and she is, without question, one of that public's greatest favourites. Strange to say, she has achieved her position without the aid of a good voice... [But] Mrs Phillips has a style peculiarly her own and her songs are invariably so well written and are given with such expression that she never fails to take her audience by storm.\\" In later years, she performed as Ma Phillips. She gave her final performance in 1887, and died in Lambeth in 1899.Baker, Richard Anthony.

Both countries gained their independence during or in the immediate aftermath of the World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary (Yugoslavia) or Russian Empire (Finland). Two parties established formal bilateral relations in 1928. Two countries developed their relations after the end of the World War II and 1948 Tito‚ÄìStalin split. At the time neither one of them was a part of either Eastern or Western Bloc in the Cold War divided Europe. Both countries perceived development of relations among non-bloc neutral European states as a way to avoid isolation and preserve certain level of independence without alienating major powers. Belgrade however perceived that in deeply divided Europe there was shrinking maneuvering space for neutral countries and followed the development of what will be called process of Finlandization with great concern. It therefore turned its focus on new allies among former colonies and mandate territories outside of Europe where it developed its policy of equidistant active neutrality via its activities in the newly founded Non-Aligned Movement. Two countries developed noticeable cultural exchange from 1960's onward. The fact that ambitious small countries in periphery or semi-periphery such as Yugoslavia and Finland were frequently capable to use superpowers rivalries to its own disproportional advantage motivated some scholars of the era (e.g. Tvrtko Jakovina) to focus on what they called pericentric studies of Cold War. Non-Aligned (Yugoslavia, Cyprus and Malta) and neutral (Finland, Switzerland, Austria and to extent Sweden) European countries continued to cooperate in effort to gap the Cold War divisions in Europe. It was particularly case in their commitment to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which preceded the modern day Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Helsinki served as the host city to the first conference which resulted in the Helsinki Accords with the first follow-up meeting being organized in Belgrade between 4 October 1977 and 8 March 1978. During and after the Yugoslav Wars Finland continued to play prominent role in trying to ensure peace and stability in Yugoslav successor states. Finland cooperated in NATO led Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo Force. Former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari, as a politician from non-NATO member country, led Kosovo status process.

Biography=Family and youth Son of Jean Loisel, alderman and advisor to the king elected in the election of Beauvais, and of Catherine d'Auvergne. His brother Philippe Loisel, was a civil and criminal lieutenant-general at the bailiwick of Senlis, and master of the duke's requests from Anjou. Antoine Loysel was prompted to marry on August 2, 1563 with Marie de Goulas (1541‚Äì1595), first cousin of Nicolas Goulas, who is also the niece of King Dumesnil's lawyer. They had 12 children. Antoine was Guillaume Marescot's stepfather. \\"He wanted to devote himself to medicine, as did his great-uncle Jean Loysel, physician to Louis XII and Fran√ßois I. His father did not approve, saying that despite the danger to which doctors are forced to expose themselves from day to day, a doctor could only be a doctor; instead a lawyer could become president and chancellor.\\"Joly Vie de Loysel In Toulouse, where his father sent him, Loysel met Cujas, and this master\\" was the cause that he did not leave the science of law, of which the other doctors disgusted him because of their barbarities.\\" He was linked by an accomplice friendship to Pierre Pithou. He was, with Nicolas Bergeron, the executor of Ramus. Career Successor of Du Moulin, he is considered the first \\"thinker\\" of French law. A disciple of Jacques Cujas, he followed him to Bourges. He was, therefore, trained in the method of the Humanist historians. In February 1560, he received his lawyer designation in Paris. In 1564, he became the Attorney General of Paris. His clients included the Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother of Henry III of France, Catherine de Medici, the House of Montmorency, and the chapter of Our Lady of Paris. He ended his career as a public prosecutor near the Chamber of Justice of Limoges. Loysel was a good follower of mos gallicus - the method of the humanists, but the practice would move him away from the study of Roman law and history. He was politically a defender of the king and the powers of the king and would, therefore, consider that the law must be that of the kingdom. He spoke first of a French law before speaking of a \\"Universal Law of our Kingdom\\". He believed that customs are \\"finally reduced to conformity, the reason for a single law\\". He wrote his work Institutes coutumi√®res in 1607, whose form is Roman and background customary. Loysel spent 40 years on his collection of the 958 maxims. It is an expression of French law in an elegant form. This is how he set the foundations of French law, by merging the rules of many customs and Roman law. Quotes Loysel liked to find formulas such as these, to synthesize the law into a series of legal adages.

He ruled over a vast area in Eastern Bengal, which, at its zenith encompassed the districts of Dhaka, Noakhali, Comila, Syhlet districts. Early life Ruins of the Palace of Kedar Dey in Bikrampur Kedar Dey was zomidar of Bikrampur and one of the renowned Baro-Bhuyans of Bengal. He was the son of Jadob Dey. His capital was at Shripur on the bank of the Kaliganga River. Battles with Conquistadors In the later half of 16th century, the rich fertile soil of gangetic planes faced invasions from 3 sides, the Mogol-Rajputs, the Portuguese Conquistadors who were at the peak of their piracy spree and the Burmese invaders of Arakan. Little do people know about that the Portuguese, who plundered the whole world, were not just defeated in Bay of Bengal, as a result of successful night-time raids to their Armada (was called Harmad by local Bengali villagers), but they also fought as mercenaries. Dreaded Portuguese leader Antonio Carvalho, Domingo Carvalho are some of them. 1st battle with Mogol-Rajputs There is an island Called Sandwip which was in the midst of two front battle because it had salt in abundance. In a battle with Mughals in that Island, Mughals lay siege but were beaten back by Kedar Ray. Battles with Burmese following another battle in which the King of Arakan Salim Shah sent 150 Ships but they too were defeated by Kedar Ray and 140 of their Ships were captured intact. But the 3rd battle was gigantic, in which 1000 ships were sent, badly outnumbered by the enemies, Kedar Ray used his Portuguese reinforcements and once again. With these reinforcements and Kedar Ray's skillful handling of the situation alongside Domingo Carvalho, the Arakanese King Salim Shah faced a massive defeat. This naval battle was the biggest and bloodiest in the history of Bengal and definitely one of the biggest in the history of India. 2nd battle with Mogol-Rajputs After their defeat near Sandwip Island, Mirza Man Singh invaded Shreepur again with a vast army. A battle took place near Kalindi River in which the Mughal army lay crushed and Man Singh retreaded with the survivors. Heros of that battle were Kalidas Dhali and Raghunandan Das. 3rd battle with Mogol-Rajputs In the next battle, Man Singh assembled a Mughal army under Kilmaq Khan and threw them to battle but the result was same as the two previous battles, disastrous defeat of Mughals. Kilmaq Khan was captured in that battle. 4th battle with Mogol-Rajputs Facing 3 straight humiliating defeats, Man Singh resorted to trickery. He struck an alliance with the ruler of Sushunga Kingdom, Roghunath Singho and invaded Shreepur again with fresh reinforcements from central command. While it seemed Mughals again would fail to achieve any breakthrough, Roghunath Singho attacked Kedar Ray's flank. Battle raged for 9 days as both sides suffered losses. Relationship with Pathans Kedar Rai maintained friendly relations with Isa Khan Masnad-i-Ala and fought against the Mughals in alliance with him. Ralph Fitch, an Elizabethan envoy to Akbar's court, mentions that when he visited the city of Sripur (1586) the king was in rebellion against Akbar. Kedar Rai allied himself with the Afghan chiefs of the family of Qutlu Khan Lohani who had carved out a state in Orissa. He in cooperation with Khwaja Sulaiman Khan Lohani captured the fort of Bhusana (1593) from its imperial commandant and kept it under his control till at least 1596 when an imperial force under Mirja Durjan Singh invaded the fort. A sudden gun burst inside the fort during the siege killed Sulaiman Lohani and wounded Kedar Rai who fled and took shelter with Isa Khan at Sonargaon (June 1596). Relationship with Burmese Ruins of Fatehjangpur Fort, Shariyatpur, Bangladesh In 1602, the imperial general (Mirza) Man Singh sent a detachment against Kedar Rai who was, however, induced to promise loyalty to Emperor Akbar. In 1603, a large fleet of the Maghs of Arakan invaded the Dhaka waters, and launched a severe attack on the Mughal fort at Trimohoni. But they were chased by a Mughal force with heavy casualties. Kedar Rai now joined the Maghs with his own fleet and attacked the Mughal outpost of Srinagar. Kedar Dey vs Isa KhanPeace deal with Mirja Man SinghRelationship with Protapadityo GuhoLegacy The ancestral home of the family of Kedar Rai at Ara Phulbaria can still be located at an elevated landmass known as Kedar Bari. There still exists a dighi excavated by Kedar Rai, and another dighi of the time of his elder brother Chand Rai known as 'Keshava Ma ka Dighi' named after a maiden of Chand Rai. The most outstanding relic of the Sripur Raj is the lofty Rajbari Math, a prominent landmark for miles around on the left bank of the river Padma, situated at a short distance from where the city of Sripur formerly began.

He was awarded the Navy Cross during the battle of Iwo Jima in World War II.  Early life and career  Daniel C. Pollock was born on December 27, 1913, in Washington, D.C. He attended Central High School where he was a member of the Cadet Corps, graduating in 1931 as valedictorian. He then attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and George Washington University before he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1936. Pollock was later commissioned as a second lieutenant.  World War II  In 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Pollock was given command of the newly formed 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, 5th Marine Division at San Diego, California. In September 1944, Pollock and the rest of the 5th Marine Division left San Diego for Camp Tarawa, Hawaii. In January 1945, the division left Camp Tarawa, stopping for a brief liberty at Pearl Harbor. On January 10, Pollock's battalion left Pearl Harbor aboard the USS Deuel (APA-160) and began sailing west across the Pacific Ocean bound for Iwo Jima. On February 8, Captain Robert H. Dunlap, the commanding officer of Company C, brought Private First Class Jack H. Lucas to Pollock's quarters. Lucas had deserted his unit to join an infantry company and stowed away on the ship. Pollock was impressed by Lucas' determination to fight and said \\"you're causing me a lot of administrative trouble, but I sure wish I had a whole boatload of men that wanted to fight as bad as you do.\\" Pollock then had Lucas assigned to Dunlap's rifle company, not realizing Lucas was only 16 years old. Both Lucas and Dunlap would later be awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle of Iwo Jima.  Battle of Iwo Jima  At 09:00 hours on February 19, elements of the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions assaulted the beaches of Iwo Jima. The 26th Marine Regiment, as the 5th Division's reserve, did not initially land at H-Hour. However, they were soon needed as the initial landing waves took heavy casualties. Pollock and his battalion landed at Red Beach at 15:00 hours. By March 19, Pollock's battalion had been reduced to a fighting strength of just over 400 Marines, down from its original strength of 1,000 men on D-Day. The remaining Marines under his charge were fatigued from five consecutive days of combat against heavily fortified positions in rugged terrain at Kitano Point. Despite heavy fire, Pollock moved to the front line and conducted a reconnaissance of Hill 165, the last high ground held by the Japanese on the island. Pollock then led his battalion in an assault against the enemy positions behind Hill 165, enveloping the hill. Japanese forces on the hill became disorganized and attempted to withdraw, only to be cut down by Pollock's Marines. He then directed his Marines in capturing and occupying the hill with minimal casualties. Upon capturing the hill, the Marines raised an American flag. Shortly after, Pollock led a small patrol into unexplored northern beach areas near the enemy's last defended strongholds. Pollock was then evacuated from the island due to wounds he received during the assault. His executive officer, Major Albert Gary, assumed command for the duration of the battle. For his actions that day, Pollock was later awarded the Navy Cross in 1946.  Later career and life  When the war ended, Pollock became one of the first Americans to lead Marines onto the Japanese mainland. Pollock remained in the Marines until his retirement as a colonel in the mid 1960s. His final assignment was with the plans and policies directorate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Upon retirement, Pollock settled in McLean, Virginia. He became active in his community, volunteering for the American Red Cross and numerous organizations in McLean and the nearby town of Herndon. Pollock was also the 5th Marine Division's representative to the National Marine Corps Council and was instrumental in planning the Marine Corps' remembrances for the 45th and 50th anniversaries of the battle of Iwo Jima. Daniel C. Pollock died of sepsis on December 23, 2007, at his home in McLean. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Another version is made similar to gravy by stewing in butter until softened, seasoned with white pepper and stirred with flour and mixed parsley. Like many sauces, these can be finished with vinegar. There are three versions of \\"White cucumber sauce\\" in Modern Cookery. One is made by boiling cucumbers and mixing with b√©chamel, another by stewing in butter and boiling in cream- thickened pale veal gravy. Alternately, the cucumbers can be boiled in seasoned veal gravy and mixed with egg yolks and an acidic ingredient like chili flavored vinegar or lemon juice to finish. In The Jewish Manual by Lady Judith Montefiore there are recipes for brown cucumber sauce, in addition to the white sauce. The white sauce is made by softening cucumbers in vinegar and water, simmering the softened cucumbers in seasoned veal broth and thickening the gravy with egg yolks before serving. The brown cucumber sauce is made by frying the cucumbers, and optionally onions, in fat, then adding beef gravy, seasoning and finishing with vinegar.

Located in the South Downtown neighborhood, it was built in 1923 as a shoe factory, converted to apartments in 2017, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2019.  History  The building was constructed in 1923 to house the M.C. Kiser Company, a shoe manufacturing company founded in Atlanta in the late 1800s. The company, described in a 1920 article of The Atlanta Constitution as ‚Äúone of the most important business establishments of Atlanta,‚Äù had outgrown its previous facilities, and this building was constructed primarily as a factory, warehouse, and retail center for their Shield Brand Shoes line. The company used the building until 1933, and afterwards it was used by various commercial entities. In March 2016, local developer Gallman Development Group announced plans to convert the building to an apartment building. Gallman, which had previously converted warehouses in Atlanta's Castleberry Hill neighborhood to lofts, planned to convert the building to an \\"industrial chic\\" living space, and that month secured $8.5 million in funding. Initially, they planned to open in Spring 2017. However, construction was prevented from starting until January 2017. A report in July stated that the building would house 36 one-bedroom apartments and five two-bedroom apartments, with a Curbed Atlanta article from July stating that the property could be marketed as student housing due to its proximity to Georgia State University. On May 28, 2019, the property was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  Design and architecture  The brick building features three stories with a basement. As it was originally built, the bottom floor was used primarily for retail, while the upper two floors were used for warehousing and as a factory. The exterior of the building features minimal ornamentation or design. The structure is an example of \\"mill\\" or \\"slow-burning\\" architecture, designed for fire prevention.

He was promoted rapidly through the enlisted ranks until he was wounded on 30 April 1915. Rendered unfit for infantry service, he began pilot's training on 17 August 1915. On 14 January 1916, he graduated with his Military Pilot's Brevet. He reported for his first posting on 8 March 1916, to fly a Caudron for Escadrille C.53. He was wounded on 30 April and sent to hospital. Upon his return, he reported to Escadrille C.202 on 17 June 1916, again as a Caudron pilot. On 29 July, he shot down a German Fokker for his first aerial victory. On 26 October 1916, Pelissier was pulled from combat duty to become an aviation instructor.

With them, he scored his sixth and last win on 16 September 1918. The records of his aerial combats are both incomplete and contradictory. Escadrille N.155--which by 1918 was actually Escadrille Spa.155--claims that Pelissier scored five of his six victories with them. However, Escadrille C.202 says he scored four victories while with them--two on unknown dates in 1916. And his victory over an observation balloon with a Caudron bomber from C.202 seems unlikely.

He was a senator, cabinet minister, envoy and pro-chancellor of Afe Babalola University. He is renowned for his groundbreaking research on Kwagh-Hir theatre, which was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2019. Hagher is passionate about the issue of leadership. His plays are preoccupied with the search for true leadership and other solutions to Africa's socio-political problems. He is known to have engaged cultural diplomacy as a tool for foreign relations while serving as Nigeria's Ambassador to Mexico, and later High Commissioner to Canada. In 2019, he was a presidential aspirant, under the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He is currently the president, African Leadership Institute, Dayton, Ohio, United States. Background Iyorwuese Hagher was born to the family of Tica Daniel Hagher Gbaaiko. His father and mother were both Christians. He was the only boy of the union which also had six girls. His father was a headmaster and missionary with the Dutch Reformed Missionaries of South Africa and worked as a field worker planting new stations and outreaches. Iyorwuese grew up sharing his parents with other children as his father adopted a lot of primary school children so they could get education. As he would recount, he too belonged to the whole village and everybody brought him up. His early life was in the village of Tse-Gbagir in Torov, present-day Ukum local government area of Benue State. It was a typical communal Tiv village. Growing up, he lived the village life: fishing, hunting, mingling and eating anything in neighbouring homes, orchards, farms and fields. The communality of the village imbued him with love and engendered in him the freedom to think, dream and be adventurous. As a primary school pupil, Iyorwuese witnessed a case of police brutality and abuse of power, when his father was arrested by the Tiv Native Authority Police during a class. His father's crime was being an active member of the United Middle Belt Congress (UMBC). During Nigeria's first republic, the UMBC had been formed to struggle for the creation of the Middle Belt State from the large Northern Region and serve as an alternative minority voice in the Northern Nigeria Assembly which was dominated by the Northern People's Congress (NPC). On the occasion of his father's arrest, pupils were also arrested for tax evasion. As his father questioned police authority to carry out the arrests, he was brutalized with truncheons and while bleeding on his head, he was dragged out of the class. His father would later be charged with obstructing the police on lawful duty. He was jailed for six months before his acquittal by the Magistrate Court in Makurdi. Later, he was arrested again for being part of the UMBC revolts and jailed for over a year before his acquittal. Iyorwuese Hagher is married to a lawyer and educationist, Nancy Ngiahiin Hagher. They have biological and non-biological children. He hails from Kasar, Katsina Ala local government area of Benue State. Education Iyorwuese Hagher had his foundational education in the early 50s and early 60s in Zaki Biam. He attended a missionary secondary school, run by the Christian Reformed Church in Canada and America, William Mackel Bristow Secondary School in Gboko, Benue State and Kuru Government Secondary School for his Higher School Certificate. In 1971, he was admitted into the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Language in 1974. He later obtained his Master of Arts and doctorate in Drama at the same university in 1977 and 1981, respectively. Career Iyorwuese Hagher's career cuts across the academia, politics, administration, diplomacy and advocacy. Academia After his compulsory National Youth Service Corps program in Bendel State (now Edo and Delta states), Hagher was appointed a pioneer staff of the Centre for Nigerian Cultural Studies and Drama Department at the Ahmadu Bello University as a graduate assistant at the age of 26. He taught and conducted research in African indigenous theatres. In 1990, he rose to the rank of a full university professor of Theatre and Drama for Development at the University of Jos, Plateau State. Hagher has published significant work on Tiv puppetry known as Kwagh-hir, which is one of the forms he is known to have used in his development efforts. His theatre works are known to address issues of corruption, governance, health and social vices. In 2000, he founded the Leadership Institute after retiring from the university. He became a public intellectual and opened up his inquisitive mind to be educated in different disciplines like peace and gender studies, conflict and mediation, and medicine and nutrition. Administration Hagher was appointed the founding Director of the Benue State Arts Council in 1982. As head of the council, he worked with Tiv peasants in Central Nigeria using Kwagh-hir puppetry theatre as a social change agent. He also established the legendary award-winning Benue State Arts Council dance troupe. In 1994, he was appointed into the Federal Executive Council of Nigeria as the Minister of State, Federal Ministry of Power and Steel under the Sani Abacha administration. In 1997, he was transferred to the Federal Ministry of Health as the Minister of State ‚Äì a position he held until the end of the administration in 1998, when Abacha passed on. As Minister of State for Health, he is known to have used drama to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Particularly, in Benue, he worked with Kwagh-hir artists to produce ‚ÄòAnakande‚Äô which effectively addressed the global epidemic when Benue State had the highest prevalence rate in Nigeria. While at the Ahmadu Bello University, Hagher was a Head of Department and an elected member of the University Senate at different occasions. He was also the University Senate's representative to the Centre for Continuing Education Academic Board. Hagher also served on the committee on Commercialization of the Nigeria Television Authority, Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria and the National Copyright Council. He was also elected as member of the Constitutional Conference of 1994‚Äì1995. Envoy Iyorwuese Hagher was appointed by President Olusegun Obasanjo as Nigeria's Ambassador to Mexico with concurrent accreditation to Panama, Costa Rica and Guatemala (2003-2008). In 2008, President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua again appointed him as Nigeria's High Commissioner to Canada: a position he held until 2012. He engaged in cultural diplomacy, using theatre, drama and poetry to enhance bilateral relations between Nigeria and the host countries. This also availed him the opportunity to lecture in some universities in those countries. He is renowned for his cultural and citizenship diplomacy and won a commendation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for his non-fiction book, Nigeria: After the Nightmare. Politics Iyorwuese Hagher began his political life in 1977 when he was appointed the Chairman of the Benue State Arts Council. This enabled him to resuscitate the top ranks of the defunct United Middle Belt Congress (UMBC) into the movement led by Chief J. S. Tarkaa, his political mentor. The national movement started by J. S. Tarka evolved into the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) which formed the government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari in 1979 and 1983. Hagher continued to be a grassroots mobilizer, using the arts of dance and drama for public social mobilization and action. In 1983, he ran for election and won a landslide victory as federal senator representing Benue North-East constituency at the age of 34. He served in the senate as the Deputy Chief Whip. His tenure would however be truncated by a coup led by Major General Muhammadu Buhari, which ended the second republic on 31 December 1983. In 1994, he was elected into the National Constitutional Conference. In 2019, he was a presidential aspirant under the platform of the Social Democratic Party. During his campaigns, Hagher urged the EFCC to prosecute presidents with fraudulent manifestoes, citing for example that the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, had promised to provide at least 20% of annual budgets for education, but less than 7% of the budget was being allocated to the sector. He also cited Buhari's campaign promise of setting up special courts, accelerating trials and jailing terrorists, kidnappers and other criminals. He lamented that Nigeria had become the most insecure place to be, torn apart along religious and ethnic lines and was gradually becoming a failed state. He hinged his campaign on a deliberate revolution of hope based on education, restructuring, modern infrastructure and human development at a pace befitting of a modern state. Advocacy and associations Iyorwuese Hagher was the Founding Chairman, Association of Pro-chancellors of Private Universities of Nigeria (APPUN); Founder/Honorary President, Leadership Institute Nigeria and Director, Association of Nigerians against Corruption (ANAC). He is at present Chairman, Board of Trustees of Pro-Chancellors of Private Universities of Nigeria and President, African Leadership Institute, USA. He is also a mentor at the Graduate School of Leadership and Change at Antioch University. He is a member of the International Council of Management Consulting Institutes, a Fellow of the Society of Nigerian Theatre Artists and Institute of Management Consultants. Hagher is a recipient of one of Nigeria's highest honors, Officer of the Order of the Niger, for his role in peace building in Nigeria, especially in negotiating for peace among the warring ethnic groups of Central Nigeria in 2003.

In 2005 Dale established her own research group as a Royal Society University Research Fellow in Dundee. Her research is focused on the investigation of the molecular mechanisms regulating the vertebrae embryonic segmentation clock.  Early life and career  Dale attended University of Southampton (UoS) in 1983, where she was awarded Bachelor (BcS) of Science in Molecular Cell Biology with first class honours in 1990. After leaving UoS she achieved a PhD in Developmental Neurobiology in University College London in 1997. Dale began her research career in the lab of Marysia Placzek, investigating tissues and signals involved in the induction and patterning of the forebrain ventral neuroectoderm of chick embryos at early stages of development. Following this, Dale obtained a postdoctoral (PhD) position in the lab of Olivier Pourqui√©, where she began to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of the segmentation clock, specifically in relation to the Notch signalling pathway. In August 2002, Dale worked as a senior research specialist in the lab of Olivier Pourqui√© at the Stowers Institute Kansas City, Missouri in the United States of America, until December 2004. Dale returned to Britain to launch her independent laboratory at the University of Dundee (UoD) in January 2005. She was awarded tenure in 2009 and is now professor of molecular Developmental Biology. In addition to her role as research scientist she is also the Associate Dean (International) in the UoD school of Life sciences and the university academic lead for international activity in ASEAN region, where she holds the position of guest professor at Taylors University, Malaysia. Through the work of Dale and her team UoD has a strong working relationship with the National University of Singapore, Taylors University and the British High Commission in Malaysia. This allows many students to undertake summer research opportunities as well as semester or year long exchanges in partner Universities in Europe and further afield.  Research  Dale's PhD research projects include the Wellcome 4-Year PhD Programme in Integrated Molecular, Cellular and Translational Biology and the MRC DTP 4 Year PhD Programme. Dale's lab looks at molecular interactions and crosstalk between various signalling pathways that cells use to communicate in order to build tissues and organs during the establishment of the vertebrae axis. Recent research by Dale and colleagues discovered new insight into the role of Notch in developmental segmentation which has opened avenues to explore the potential association of mis-regulated Notch signalling in the context of cancer. Further details can be found in their primary publication \\"CDK 1 and CDK 2 regulate NICD 1 turnover and the periodicity of the segmentation clock\\". Dale is currently involved in an active project at the Medical Research Council which focuses on Fine-Scale Regulation of Notch Signalling Dynamics, in the Context of the Vertebrate Segmentation Clock. This project began on 14/Aug/2019 and is scheduled to completion on 13/Aug/2022.

Early life and education  A bronze medallist in the International Math Olympiad 1991, K≈ëszegi graduated magna cum laude in mathematics from Harvard University in 1996. He earned his doctoral degree in economics from MIT in 2000, under the supervision of Nobel laureate Peter Diamond and Romneycare/Obamacare architect Jon Gruber.  Career  After completing his PhD, K≈ëszegi joined the faculty of UC Berkeley. In 2002‚Äì03, he was also a visiting faculty member at his alma mater MIT. In 2012, he accepted an appointment at Central European University, ultimately leaving UC Berkeley in 2013.  Scholarship  K≈ëszegi is a theoretical economist with an interest in behavioral economics, who has studied, among other topics, temporal utility and addiction. According to K≈ëszegi, behavioral economics is not so much a branch of economics, as an attitude of the economists engaged in studying it. \\"Behaviorists simply strive to start from the most realistic human behavior possible.\\" Further, while the notion of nudging popularized by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein paints behavioral economists as libertarian paternalists, K≈ëszegi says that behaviorists are generally afraid of paternalism. Together with Matthew Rabin, K≈ëszegi developed a formal model to address criticisms of prospect theory. This work has been discussed in behavioral economics. Along with , K≈ëszegi has done work on the economic implications of consumer naivete. This joint work shows that, while laissez- faire regulation is usually considered synonymous with competitive markets, for complex products the right regulations can foster, and are necessary for, competition. For example, in complex markets that require a high level of research from customers to get a good deal, price caps can be effective both in helping the less well-off and also in boosting competition.

The basalt is distinctive for its olivine content (typically altered to iddingsite) and its diktytaxitic texture, in which the basalt contains laths of plagioclase that are randomly oriented and have angular spaces between grains. Geologists have not reached consensus on whether the alluvium beds should be regarded as part of the formation. These are lithologically similar to nearby sedimentary units of the Santa Fe Group. Those investigators who include the alluvium in the unit tend to refer to the unit as the Servilleta Formation, while those who do not tend to refer to the unit as the Servilleta Basalt. The formation rests unconformably on the Picuris Formation, Santa Fe Group, or Hinsdale Formation. It is up to thick near Embudo but thins to thick adjacent to the Picuris Mountains. It is downfaulted against Santa Fe Group beds near Pilar and on the northeast side of the Picuris Mountains. Economic geology The unit can be divided into three sets of flows separated by alluvium in the southern San Luis Valley. The alluvium separating the upper two flows is a significant local aquifer known as the Agua Azul. History of investigation The formation was first named by A.P. Butler, Jr., in his unpublished 1946 dissertation.Butler 1946 In 1971, Burroughs added the Mesita Member, a trachyandesite flow in the San Luis Hills, to the formation.

After an 18-year hiatus from the Cornwall novels, it was published in 1973. While Ward Lock published the first four novels in the series, publishing house Collins took over the reins with the fifth entry. Two children are born in the novel: A son, Valentine, to George and Elizabeth Warleggan; and a daughter, Clowance, to Ross and Demelza Poldark. Dwight Enys, captured by the French and held as a prisoner-of-war, is rescued by Ross Poldark and a crew of Cornishmen. Two of Demelza's brothers, Sam and Drake Carne, enter the story and become major figures, as does Elizabeth's cousin Morwenna Chynoweth. Ray Penvenen dies, making Caroline an heiress. Aunt Agatha also dies, in dramatic circumstances. Wheal Grace starts yielding a decent payoff for Ross and Demelza. The Warleggan clan goes from financial success to financial success and George becomes a magistrate. The novel ends with George wondering whether he really is the father of Valentine. Synopsis=Book One Book One, with twelve chapters, opens in February 1794 with the birth at Trenwith of Elizabeth's second son. He is named Valentine Warleggan. He is born on the day of lunar eclipse, also called a \\"black moon\\". The book closes in September 1794. * Two of Demelza's brothers -- Samuel and Drake Carne -- walk to Nampara in March. They tell Demelza that her father died a month ago, and they ask Ross for jobs in his mine. He agrees to do this. They repair and live in Reath Cottage, the former home of Mark and Keren Daniel. Samuel is an ardent Methodist. Desiring to add a room to Reath Cottage to serve as a Methodist meeting place, they carry a heavy shipmast home to serve as a ceiling beam. They carry it across Trenwith land and in so doing, run into young Geoffrey Francis Poldark and his governess, Morwenna Chynoweth. Drake has eyes for her. Morwenna and Geoffrey agree to keep the fact of the trespassing to themselves. * In May, Demelza tells Ross she is expecting another child. * Caroline Penvenen, staying with her uncle, hears that several British ships were sunk in recent fighting. One of them might be the ship Dwight Enys is on. She rides to Falmouth, where Verity Blamey (nee Poldark) lives, to see if Verity knows or can find out. She learns that his ship, the Travail, is one of the sunken ships. However, it is not clear what Dwight's fate was. She returns to Kilwarren and is reluctant to leave for more than a few hours at a time because her uncle is dying. Ross visits, and she asks him to use his contacts in the smuggling community to see if they know anything. * Ross sets out to buy a horse for Demelza and runs into an old acquaintance, Bartholomew \\"Tholly\\" Tregirls. They haven't seen each other for over a decade. Tholly, halfway in age between Ross and Ross's father, has a hook for one hand from a shipping accident, is an inveterate womanizer and is not aging well. * Drake Carne runs into Geoffrey Francis and Morwenna on Hewlandra Beach. He takes them to interesting spots he has discovered. He asks Demelza to teach him to read and write. * Sam Carne builds a local group of Methodists and, since there is no Methodist church to attend on Sundays, he takes them to the Anglican church in Sawle. This is the church attended by the occupants of Trenwith, a group now headed by George Warleggan. Warleggan indicates to the pastor that he expects the congregation to stand in respect when the Warleggans enter the church. Sam Carne and his Methodists are not interested in doing that, so Pastor Odgers tells them they are no longer welcome. * Ralph-Allen Daniell is introduced: He \\"was a very rich merchant, middle-aged, comfortable, well thought of, who had had no need to align himself with anyone, since his interests were wide enough to guarantee his independence and his innate caution saw no virtue in taking sides\\". He asks Ross to serve as a magistrate. Ross turns him down, even when he is told that if he doesn't take it, the position will be offered to George Warleggan. George, when the offer is made to him, immediately accepts. * Ross predicts a famine, because \\"the pilchard catch was poor for the third year running\\" and the corn crop largely failed. * Ross travels to Breton courtesy of a smuggling crew in search of news about Dwight. He learns that it is very likely that he survived the shipwreck of the Travail and is being held as a prisoner-of-war. Book Two Book Two, consisting of eight chapters, opens in November 1794 with the birth of a daughter to Demelza. The girl is named Clowance. * Ray Penvenen dies in late November. * Morwenna Chynoweth and George Francis Poldark are left at Trenwith, with Aunt Agatha and servants, while Elizabeth and George Warleggan spend months late in the year and on into the new year at their estate Cardew. Drake Carne takes advantage of their absence to frequently visit George Francis and Morwenna at Trenwith. This allows him to develop his relationship with Morwenna. They kiss for the first time: \\"He bent his head and put his lips against hers. Her lips were cool and a little dry, like petals just unfurling from the bud. Complete chastity and complete sexuality coexisted in them...so a relationship was sealed that had no business to begin and no authority to continue.\\" At Cardew, George announces to Elizabeth that he has decided to find a wealthy or socially connected husband for Morwenna. Osborne \\"Ossie\\" Whitworth is chosen. * The Warleggans decide to close Wheal Leisure even though it is still making a modest profit. Ross, when told of this, says, \\"Merciful God...that will mean throwing upon the parish sixty or seventy folk: thirty-five to forty families will be affected, among them some of my own friends\\". * Ross becomes involved in a plan, financed by the British government, to land an expeditionary force on the French coast of five to six thousand French soldiers who are loyal to the French royalty. His involvement is because the landing point is about eighty miles from where he believes Dwight is a prisoner-of-war. * The Warleggans return to Trenwith. George dislikes the sound of toads croaking. He had previously ordered the removal of all toads from the pond near the residence. But, on his first morning back, toads are lustily croaking. He is angry. After several days of toad removal, his workmen tell him they believe that toads are being re-added to the pond periodically as a hostile act against George. George begins to believe that Ross is the malefactor. He sets five men to guard the pond during the still watches of the night. It is in fact Drake Carne who is responsible for adding the toads. He engages in an expedition on a night with five watchmen posted; they nearly catch him. He escapes, but with a significant injury. As Book Two closes, it is late spring of 1795, and Drake Carne learns from George Francis that the Warleggans are pressuring Morwenna to marry Ossie Whitworth. Book Three Book Three, consisting of thirteen chapters, begins in late May and ends in early August of 1795. Key events are the failed Royalist expedition to France, the rescue of Dwight Enys, the death of Aunt Agatha, Morwenna's marriage to Ossie Whitworth and George's dawning realization that the paternity of his son, Valentine, may be in question. * Plans are finalized for Ross to participate in the Quiberon expedition under the command of John Borlase Warren and Lord Bridport. The plans were largely hatched by the Comte de Puisaye. Caroline Penvenen is portrayed as being friends with Charles Eug√®ne Gabriel de Sombreuil who also is involved in planning the expedition. * Having heard about a potential marriage between Morwenna and Ossie Whitworth, Drake Carne arranges to periodically meet her at Sawle Church. These meetings are observed by the pastor, who discloses them to George. Morwenna is furiously rebuked by George. George then notifies Ossie Whitworth that Morwenna has been \\"compromised by another man\\" thus at least temporarily ending the possibility of that marriage. Warleggan takes advantage of the troubles involving Geoffrey Charles to get his mother to agree to send him off to boarding school in the fall, a move that Elizabeth had previously been able to resist. Geoffrey Charles arranges a final farewell meeting between Morwenna, Drake and himself at Trenwith at a time when the Warleggans are out, and gives Drake a farewell present of his expensive christening Bible. 24 hours later, Drake is arrested and thrown in jail for the theft of this item. * Ross muscles his way into an audience with Warleggan at Trenwith to request that Warleggan get the theft charges against Drake Carne dropped. Warleggan, as magistrate, will be hearing the same charges that he is bringing. Warlegann declines to have the charges dismissed. Ross then renews a threat he made two years ago, which is that unless Warleggan dropped his active hostilities, Ross would incite a miner uprising against Warleggan. Warleggan, considering his options, decides to drop the charges. Drake finds Ross to thank him. Ross invites Drake to join the French expedition, and Drake accepts. * Ross Poldark, in conjunction with the French Royalists invading France in the Quiberon expedition, leads a small group of Cornishmen to find and rescue Dwight Enys. Through a series of James Bond-esque thrilling exploits, this mission is accomplished and Dwight is returned to Cornwall, albeit ill and greatly emaciated. Drake Carne distinguishes himself with his cleverness and bravery on these adventures, earning Ross's approval for the first time. * When Drake Carne is in France, Morwenna is hastily married to Ossie Whitworth. George Warleggan organizes the marriage in retaliation for the pressure he received from Ross to dismiss the charges against Drake. * Because of Drake's actions in France, Ross decides to set him up in business, partly to allow him to get a toehold in life that will enable him to marry Morwenna, only to discover that Morwenna was wed to Whitworth in their absence. * Aunt Agatha plans a 100th birthday party for herself in August, in defiance of George's wishes. Two days before the party is to occur, George confronts her in her bedroom and tells her he has discovered a mistake and that she is only 98. Because of this, he tells her he is cancelling the party and sending notes to all her invited guests to that effect. This enrages her and she strikes out at him to imply that when Valentine was born, he was not a full-term baby: \\"Maybe ye didn't wait for the wedding ceremony, you and Elizabeth, eh? Maybe that was it. Was that it, eh?...Or maybe someone else was riding she afore ever you was wed! Eh? Eh? Your precious Valentine!\\" Later than night, Agatha dies and George reflects, \\"He had killed his viper. He had given it, he knew, a mortal wound. But as he took his foot from its neck it had turned and bitten his heel. And the venom it had left behind was working\\".

Season Before the season began a major change had to be undertaken; the Boston Madison Square Garden, the new indoor facility for the Boston Bruins, was going to serve as the new home for Harvard hockey, but due to a lack of ice, the team would have to travel south to use the New York Madison Square Garden for practices. Tex Rickard controlled both buildings and he was willing to let Harvard have access to either. There was also a change of university policy for the team as it was now able to play more than two away games per season. The team opened their season with a pair of solid wins and then lost their two-game series against Toronto. Despite the loss, Harvard had pushed the Blues into overtime in both games and looked to be as strong as they were the year before. The second game only ended in a scoreless tie due to Toronto's captain threw his stick to knock the puck off of a Crimson stick (not a penalty at the time). Harvard's championship hopes were dealt a serious blow when they lost the first game of their collegiate season on Dartmouth's new rink and then had to wait over a month before their next game. The Crimson were able to exact some revenge in the rematch against the Indians but they had little margin for error after an easy tilt against Pennsylvania. They entered the series against Yale with their foes having gone undefeated to that point (13‚Äì0‚Äì1) but Harvard could still spoil the Eli's season. In front of 12,000 spectators at the Garden, Harvard ground out a 2‚Äì1 overtime win in a penalty-filled game. The rematch came a week later and once again the home team one, unfortunately that team was Yale. Harvard was held scoreless throughout the game but the defense remained stout and only surrendered a single goal in the third period. The final game, which would decide whether or not Yale could claim a championship, was played at Yale on the 13th of March and the two teams proved to be the equal of the other once more. While Yale appeared to be the better team at times during the game they would not distance themselves from the Crimson and the two teams finished regulation tied at 2-all. Overtime was needed but after a scoreless 10-minutes another was required. Neither team was able to end the game by the 80th minute so a third extra session was yet required. With both teams visible exhausted Frank Nelson was finally able to score the deciding goal, he just happened to be wearing an Eli sweater. While Harvard finished with a less-than-satisfying result and their record was rather poor, the Crimson had played tremendously well through most of the year, they just couldn't get luck to side in their favor in 1929.

Education  Renke earned a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental science from Vassar College, Master of Science from the Yale School of the Environment, and Juris Doctor from the University of Colorado Law School.  Career  Prior to serving as Attorney General, Renkes worked as an attorney in Alaska and Washington, D.C. Renkes served as Alaska Attorney General under Governor Frank Murkowski from 2002 to 2005. In 2005, Renkes resigned after receiving a formal letter of reprimand from the governor. Renkes had been accused of ethical violations while managing an international trade deal between Alaska and Taiwan while standing to profit from the deal, after it was disclosed that he had invested in KLX, Inc., a coal-processing company. After Renkes resigned, United States Attorney Robert Bundy determined that Renkes' stake in KLX did not constitute an ethics violation, though Renkes had violated Alaska law by not seeking an outside opinion on his involvement in the trade deal. After resigning as Attorney General, Renkes relocated to Jackson, Wyoming, where he worked as a corporate attorney and real estate investor. In 2018, Renkes was selected to serve in the United States Department of the Interior as the Director of the Office of Policy Analysis. During his tenure in the Interior Department, Renkes has specialized on issues related to Antarctica policy.

It is traditionally served in a Rokz salt-rimmed martini glass, and garnished with scoop of premium red Atlantic salmon caviar, and a \\"T\\"-shaped slice of lemon peel. It is not a true martini, but is one of many drinks that incorporate the term into their names. The \\"Trump\\" portion of the cocktail's name is named after Donald Trump. Origins The Trumptini is the signature cocktail of the Trump International Beach Resort in Miami, Florida. It is named after the hotel's owner Donald Trump in honour of the hotel's opening in 1992, despite the fact that Trump himself is teetotal. In 2008, the Trumptini was awarded as \\"Best Signature Drink\\" by the Miami New Times. The \\"Trumptini\\" is a trademarked brand. In June 2016, ownership of the Trumptini trademark was transferred from The Trump Organisation to Drinks Americas. Variations Unofficial variations of the Trumptini have been served at various locations across the world. During the 2016 US Presidential Election Campaign, The Rustic restaurant in Houston, Texas served a version of the Trumptini which used vodka instead of Bacardi, and used gold flakes instead of lemon peel. In 2018, Maxwells Steakhouse in Covent Garden, London, England created a \\"Stormy Trumptini\\" cocktail to commemorate President Trump's State Visit to the United Kingdom. The Stormy Trumptini was similar to a porn star martini, made with vanilla-flavoured vodka, Passo√£, passion fruit juice, and passion fruit puree. The cocktail was garnished with candy floss to imitate Trump's distinctive hairstyle, and was served alongside a shot glass of prosecco and Grenadine, which was meant to resemble the \\"nuclear button\\". As an internet meme In April 2020, during a press conference on the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump appeared to suggest that injecting disinfectants into the body could be an effective cure for coronavirus. Trump's comments were ridiculed online and formed the basis of several memes, with internet users creating fake recipes for a Trumptini cocktail, consisting of mixes of various bleaches and other disinfectants, and garnished with Tide Pods.

It is based in Las Vegas, and it had 77 locations as of 2020. The company originated with a tortilleria that was founded in San Ysidro, San Diego in 1964, by Roberto Robledo and his wife Dolores. They subsequently purchased several restaurants, before renaming them Roberto's Taco Shop around 1970. The chain expanded to the Las Vegas Valley in 1990, and was also operating in Miami by the end of the decade. History Roberto's Taco Shop was founded in 1964, by Roberto Robledo (1928‚Äì1999) and his wife Dolores (1930‚Äì2020). They had immigrated from Mexico to California in the 1950s. The couple had 13 children, and Roberto Robledo often worked two or three jobs to support the family. In the early 1960s, Roberto Robledo purchased a tortilla maker for $30. He also acquired two adjacent houses in San Ysidro, San Diego, near the Mexican border. One of the houses was used for the Robledo family, while the other was converted into a tortilleria, opened in 1964. The family began making tortillas and selling them to the public. They subsequently expanded their service, delivering tortillas to restaurants in San Diego. They also delivered to agents of the United States Border Patrol who worked at an immigrant holding facility in the area. The idea to open a quick-service Mexican restaurant came after agents asked Dolores Robledo if she could provide rice and beans with the tortillas. The family purchased four restaurants during the 1960s, but retained the existing names. Roberto Robledo's first restaurant, La Lomita, was purchased in the late 1960s, and it used his wife's recipes. Each of the newly acquired restaurants served Mexican food. Around 1970, the Robledos purchased a fifth restaurant known as Jesse's, which had previously sold hamburgers. At the suggestion of Dolores, the five restaurants were renamed Roberto's Taco Shop, after her husband. Roberto's became one of the first taco chains in the United States. The Robledos' older children helped run the business and they each took over a restaurant in later years. The business is family owned, and franchises are usually not sold to the public. During the mid-1970s, Roberto Robledo rented one of his taco shops to his cousins. A dispute occurred when the cousins did not prepare fresh batches of rice and beans on a daily basis as Robledo had wanted. In response, the cousins changed the name of their restaurant to Alberto's, which started a series of spin-off restaurants in the southwestern United States that use some variation of the \\"berto\\" name. More relatives and friends immigrated to the United States from the Robledos' home state of San Luis Potos√≠, and they continued to branch out with their own restaurant variations of the \\"berto\\" name. Roberto's Taco Shop became successful starting in the mid-1970s, becoming a well known chain in San Diego. Roberto and Dolores Robledo split up in 1979, but remained friends and business partners. Roberto Robledo moved to the Las Vegas Valley in 1990 and opened the first of numerous Roberto's locations in the area that year. Like in San Diego, Roberto's also became a popular chain in the Las Vegas area. The chain also expanded to Miami. In May 1999, a location opened in the Miami-area city of Hialeah, Florida. Roberto Robledo died a month later. At the time, Roberto's had 60 locations, including 30 in San Diego County and 30 in Nevada and Miami. In 2007, the chain expanded to several California communities, including Encinitas, Leucadia, Mission Valley, and Solana Beach. Four years later, Roberto's had plans to expand into Orange and Imperial County in California. As of 2014, there were 48 Roberto's locations in and near Las Vegas, including a location in Mesquite, Nevada. In 2016, Roberto's opened its first northern Nevada location, in Reno. The Robledo family had first considered a Reno location five years earlier, after getting frequent emails from customers requesting a location there. Dolores Robledo died in July 2020, after a brief illness. At the time, the chain had 77 locations, with more than 50 in southern Nevada. In August 2020, Roberto's opened a restaurant in Sparks, Nevada, marking its third location in northern Nevada. Various robberies have occurred at Roberto's locations, both in California and Nevada. Most locations operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year. In Las Vegas, the restaurants are especially popular among late-night partiers. Products Roberto's sells Mexican food items such as tacos, rice and beans. Popular items include taquitos, bean burritos, and carne asada burritos. The burritos are known for their large size. Roberto's is sometimes credited with introducing the California burrito, which is stuffed with French fries. Lard is a common ingredient in the restaurant's dishes. Roberto's food has been praised. In 2003, the Miami New Times named Roberto's as the city's best 24-hour taco shop in its annual \\"Best of Miami\\" awards. Two years later, Roberto's won for best tacos in the Best of Miami awards. Roberto's was also praised by the Miami Herald and The Palm Beach Post, and was popular among readers of the North County Times in Escondido, California. Readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal have named Roberto's for best tacos on several occasions, part of the newspaper's \\"Best of Las Vegas\\" awards. It won several categories in the 2016 Best of Las Vegas, including \\"Best Late Night Eats\\". Readers of Las Vegas Weekly named it the city's best taco shop in 2017, 2019, and 2020.

Located in the crossing of Saint Peter Basilica in Rome, the work depicts Andrew the Apostle leaning over the crux decussata of his martyrdom. Duquesnoy's St Andrew is one of four colossal statues beneath the dome of St. Peter, standing opposite to Bernini's less restrained Saint Longinus. The four colossi were installed in niches within the four piers supporting the dome between 1639 and 1640. Close-up of the sculpture Background, commission and production There is debate over weather Duquesnoy was commissioned first the Saint Susanna or the Saint Andrew, and whether the critical success of the former secured Duquesnoy the commission of the letter or the other way around, with modern scholars leaning toward the assumption that the Saint Andrew was commissioned first, based on documentary records. In a letter to Duquesnoy by Peter Paul Rubens, which the latter penned to thank the former for the models after the Van den Eynde's putti, Rubens praises the beauty of the Van den Eynde's putti and refers to the fame of the Saint Andrew, but he makes no mention of the Saint Susanna. The full-scale stucco model of St. Andrew was unveiled in its intended niche on December 19, 1629, in front of the Pope and the attending cardinals. Among them, was Cardinal Biscia, the cardinal protector of the confraternity of the Baker's guild (which undertook the commission of Duquesnoy's St. Susanna in San Maria di Loreto). He might in fact have recommended Duquesnoy to the confraternity overseeing the works for S. Maria di Loreto after seeing Duquesnoy's full-scale model of the St. Andrew. Upon its unveiling, the statue was closely scrutinized by critics and other artists in Saint Peter. It was well received by both. As for those on his concurrent work on the St. Susanna, payments for Duquesnoy's work on the St. Andrews were interrupted in the summer of 1633. Duquesnoy received his final blocks of marble for the St. Andrew in April 1633. Payments were issued to him in April and May, but were then interrupted until March 1634. Payments were then resumed, and they continued at monthly intervals for the next several years. According to Sandrart, due to \\"intrigues against Duquesnoy,\\" payments to the sculptor for his work on the Saint Andrew were so delayed that he became desperate. Duquesnoy was able to finish the St. Andrew thanks to Giustiniani, who advanced him 300 scudi for a sculpture of the Virgin he commissioned from Duquesnoy. Style and composition The four colossi in Saint Peter were approved by the Congregazione della Fabbrica of Saint Peter in a meeting held in May 1628. While contemporary biographers of Duquesnoy and earlier, 20th century scholars believed that in this meeting a model by Duquesnoy (according to them risen to fame thanks to his Saint Susanna) received the approval of the Pope, modern scholars have come to disprove such assumption. In 1968, Irving Lavin noted that in the official transcription of the May 1628 meeting, it was recorded that the model chosen by the Pope for Saint Andrew was in fact Gian Lorenzo Bernini's. Duquesnoy got involved only later, and, in fact, it likely was the reception of Duquesnoy's stucco model for the St. Andrew that helped him secure his commission for the St. Susanna. Bernini's original design for the Saint Andrew and the Saint Longinius posed the saints in contrasting postures of adoration, with their gaze directed up towards the Resurrected Christ originally planned to sit on top of the Baldacchino. Saint Andrew was planned by Bernini to be the more active of the two figures. In 1631, plans changed, and the Resurrected Christ was replaced by the Baldacchino's globe and cross. Bernini revisited his project for the St. Longinius, finally opting for the portrayal of the Saint in the narrative context of his story. The result was a figure much closer to Duquesnoy's St. Andrew, albeit more active, with the saint depicted when he discovers the Christ's divinity after piercing the Christ with his lance. The Saint Andrew remained unchanged from its early stucco model by Duquesnoy, but, according to Irving Lavin, \\"its intended significance was shifted from St. Andrew's adoration of the risen Christ to his emulation of the Crucifixion.\\" In spite of its postural similarity to Bernini's St. Longinius, Duquesnoy's opus clearly bears Duquensoy's mark, affected as it is by the latter's maniera greca, which was at odds with Bernini's approach. The large, muscular, Laoco√∂n-like torso of the Saint Andrew, standing leaned against his carefully detailed saltire cross, is indeed an \\"almost direct quotation of the ancient sculpture; so unlike with Bernini's solutions, yet so congruent with Duquesnoy's ideas about the Greek manner.\\" Duquesnoy's Saint Andrew stands in Saint Peter opposite to Bernini's Longinius, and while both figures are unquestionably Baroque, in contrast to the more dynamic composition of Bernini, Duquesnoy's Saint Andrew is quite static; its draperies are motionless, which is at odds with the billowing clothing of Bernini's Longinius.

Background After the Battle of Lintulaks the Swedish commander Otto von Fieandt received reinforcements from the Swedish Field-Marshal Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor, which increased his forces to about 1,200 men with 4 guns to protect the highway leading to Kokkola. The Russians opposing him likewise saw their forces grow to the size of about 3,100. The Russians attacked the Swedes on July 11 and once again met them deployed in an overextended line ‚Äî with gaps and no reserve ‚Äî extending two kilometres crossed over the Kokkola highway, with their right flank protected by the Perho river. As in the previous battle, the Russians kept several battalions as reserve while still heavily outnumbering the Swedes in the attack.  Swedish forces  *√Öbo Infantry Regiment (1 Battalion) *Nyland Infantry Regiment (1 Battalion) *Tavastehus Infantry Regiment (2 companies) *Savolax Infantry Regiment (2 companies) *Savolax J√§ger Regiment (2 companies) *Nyland Dragoon Regiment (20‚Äì50) *Finnish Artillery Regiment (4 guns) In total: 1,200 men and 4 guns Battle The Swedes resisted stubbornly, the artillery on both sides duelled near the highway while the infantry fought intensely out on the bog; some Swedish battalions counterattacked and pushed several Russian lines back, until their reserve gave them enough weight to repulse the Swedish attack. Jankovitj then reinforced his right flank with two battalions from the reserve ‚Äî to encircle the Swedish left and gain access to the highway from behind ‚Äî while his other battalions increased their activity at the front; this forced Fieandt to withdraw one kilometre, where he once again made a brief stand at a forest edge to buy time for the collection of wounded, before he eventually ordered a retreat towards Tunkkarin Silta, five kilometres away. The skirmish at Kokonsaari had proved to be one of the more intensely fought engagements during the whole war. The Swedish casualty report mentioned 159 privates and seven officers killed or wounded, however, this number excludes missing (an additional killed and captured); it is therefore likely that the total casualties in dead and wounded reached a sixth of their fighting force, excluding the prisoners. The Russians had lost 16 officers and around 300 privates. The Swedish force had stood well up against the much larger Russian and their retreat had been executed in good order. Aftermath The Russian threat towards Kokkola and the Swedish supply lines had increased and, upon hearing the news of the defeat, Klingspor sent the entire sixth brigade (consisting of the remains of the Swedish force which had landed at Vaasa) to reinforce Fieandt. The Swedish main army then defeated the Russians at the Battle of Lapua, at 14 July, which cut the Russian connection between Kuopio and Vaasa; Klingspor, however, failed to take advantage of his victory. The effects of the battle led to the return of the Swedish sixth brigade to the main army ‚Äî that was initially send to reinforce Fieandt ‚Äî while Feiandt could advance as far as Karstula, a few Swedish miles southeast of the two-way intersection at Lintulaks and still effectively protect the highway to Kokkola; Fieandt, who had been reinforced by the other half of the 2nd Tavastehus Battalion and 230 Landwehr, was once again defeated by Jegor Vlastov, at the Battle of Karstula, on 21 August.

It organizes trips to outdoor destinations around Southern California and the Western United States. The club was cited as a contributing factor to Pomona College's designation as a top college for hikers by Backpacker magazine. History Mount Baldy camping trip, 1903.jpgCampsite Devil's backbone straddle, 1903.jpgStraddling Devil's Backbone ridge Mount Baldy summit, 1903.jpgSummit cairn Pomona's 1923 Snow Day at Camp Baldy The history of outdoors activities at the Claremont Colleges dates back to the inception of its founding member, Pomona College, in the 1880s. In his 1914 history of the college, founding trustee Charles B. Sumner recalls the exploratory spirit of the college's earliest students, traveling to the \\"literal wilderness\\" of the Inland Empire to create an environment \\"like a party in the woods preparing for a camp\\". The March 1920 edition of the Pomona College Quarterly Magazine observed the following: In 1913, Pomona's Metate yearbook described the college's proximity to nature as one of its greatest advantages, and in 1923 it noted a women's hiking club. The college's retreat center in Idyllwild, California, Halona Lodge, was built in 1931. The precise founding date of OTL as a club in its current form is not currently known, but it dates back at least several decades. It was originally called the Outings Club, but was later renamed after a 1967 book, On the Loose, by Renny and Terry Russell. The club's operations became increasingly formalized following the establishment of the Outdoor Education Center of Pomona College in 2011. Activities The 2015 Speedo Hike OTL is one of the largest clubs at the 5Cs, and sponsors more than 150 trips per year. In the 2005‚Äì2006 academic year, more than 700 students went on trips totalling more than 4000 student days off campus. Frequent destinations include the San Gabriel Mountains, Los Angeles beaches, Joshua Tree National Park, Big Sur, the Sierra Nevada, and the Colorado Plateau. Trips are led by OTL leaders, who have passed a training. Prior to breaks, OTL holds \\"shindigs\\" during which trips are planned. OTL's flagship annual event is a large hike up Mt. Baldy in swimwear or goofy costumes, which can draw more than 100 participants. It was begun in 2007 as the Speedo Hike, with speedos mandatory for men and bikinis mandatory for women, but the dress code was relaxed in subsequent years. In 2016, the hike was cancelled due to safety and inclusivity concerns, prompting criticism from several right-wing media outlets. It was revived the next year as a generic costumed hike, but many participants still don swimwear. OTL is separate from but affiliated with Pomona College's Outdoor Education Center, which teaches courses in outdoor leadership, rents equipment, and runs the Orientation Adventure program for all incoming students. It is also unaffiliated with Pomona's annual ski-beach day tradition.

Bd 13, H√§xornas Europa 1400-1700 : historiska och antropologiska studier, Nerenius & Sant√©rus, Stockholm, 1987 Norway was in a union with Denmark during this period, and the witch trials were conducted by instructions from Copenhagen. History=Background The Norwegian law Landsloven in the 13th-century stated the death penalty for magic if it resulted in someone's death or injury, but no execution for sorcery is known in Norway prior to the 16th century and only one witch trial: the one of Ragnhild Tregag√•s in 1325. In 1584 King Frederick II of Denmark and Norway, on the recommendation of the Bishop of Stavanger J√∏rgen Eriksen, who were concerned about the frequent habit of the population's trust in the services of cunning men and cunning women, introduced the death penalty on the practicing of all sorcery in the Stavanger Bishopric; in 1593, this law was expanded to apply in all of Norway. The witch trials Between 1561 and 1760, about 860 people were put on trial for witchcraft in Norway, resulting in about 277 confirmed executions. However, these figures comes from the confirmed cases of which there are documentation and as such represent only a minority, as much documentation is known to be missing. The unconfirmed witch trials are estimated to be at least 1400, resulting in at least 350 executions. The most well documented areas are Finnmark, Rogaland and Hordaland from the 1590s onward. In investigation could be instigated by the bailiff with reference to public safety after rumours of witchcraft had been heard from at least three different households. An accusation from a private citizen often came after a conflict, and was usually death or illness allegedly caused by witchcraft. The authorities and the clergy managed the witch trials after instructions from international demonology handbooks, were Devil's Pacts and Witches' Sabbaths were the main definitions of a witch, but in general, the Norwegians did not include such things in their accusations, nor did the accused, who could admit to practicing folk magic voluntarily but did not associate this with Satan. The authorities interrogated the accused by interpreting their testimony so that it could fit in with the witch trial handbook's definition of what a witch was, and used torture to get a confession about a Devil's Pacts and a Witches' Sabbath. Torture prior to a confession was formally illegal in accordance with the Danish torture law of 1547, but was nevertheless commonly used. After a guilty verdict, the condemned was interrogated again, this time to expose accomplices. Death by torture or in prison was common. The method of execution was often burning alive at the stake. The majority of those accused in Norway were either poor, vagabonds, beggars and other marginalized people; or cunning folk, normally people long rumoured to perform sorcery, and 80 percent were women, normally a married woman or a widow. The most profiled victims of the Norwegian witch hunt were Anne Pedersdotter of 1590 and Lisbeth Nypan of 1670. The end After the 1670s, witch trials became more and more uncommon in Norway. The reason was that the high courts started to investigate and prevent the legal mistakes often made by the local courts handling the witch trials, such as the use of torture prior to a guilty verdict, the use of condemned criminals as witnesses and trial by ordeal, all of which were technically illegal and all of them commonly used in the witch trials. When witch trials were conducted in accordance with the law after the 1670s, the became smaller and fewer, and the method of execution was also to be decapitation rather than burning. The Norwegian law of 1687 kept death penalty for witchcraft, and the Witchcraft Act was in fact formally in place until 1842. The last confirmed execution for sorcery in Norway was the execution of Johanne Nilsdatter in 1695. Witch trials did occur in Norway during the 18th-century, but the authorities no longer issued the death penalty in such cases. Because of lacking documentation, some of the witch trials in the 18th-century may theoretically have resulted in death sentences, such as the one against Brita Alvern in 1729.
