Speaking later about his difficulty in trying to work under the Dogme restrictions, he described himself as a \\"visual director\\" and Dogme as a movement where \\"the camera follows the [actors] and choice means nothing\\". In 2003, Genz released his first feature film, an adaptation of the children's book Someone like Hodder (Danish title: En som Hodder) by popular writer Bjarne Reuter. He followed it in 2005 with Chinaman (Danish title: Kinamand), a romantic comedy about a man who takes a foreign wife in an arranged marriage so that she can obtain permission for residency, and then falls in love with her. Genz returned to his roots in 2008, adapting (with Dunja Gry Jensen) a novel by fellow Gram native Erling Jepsen into the film Terribly Happy.

Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court settled an intercircuit conflict regarding civil procedure for prisoners seeking redress. The court held that prisoners alleging assaults by prison guards must meet §1997e(a)'s exhaustion requirement before commencing a civil rights action.. Background Ronald Nussle, an inmate at the Cheshire Correctional Institution in Connecticut, asserted that, on or about June 15, 1996, several correctional officers asked him to leave his cell, \\"placed him against a wall and struck him with their hands, kneed him in the back, [and] pulled his hair.\\" Nussle alleged that the attack was unprovoked and unjustified, and that the officers told him they would kill him if he reported the beating. Without filing a grievance through the Connecticut Department of Correction, on June 10, 1999, Nussle commenced an action in federal district court under 42 U. S. C. §1983; he filed suit days before the three-year statute of limitations ran out on the §1983 claim. Nussle charged, principally, that the corrections officers' assault violated his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court, relying on §1997e(a), dismissed Nussle's complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.Nussle v. Willette, 3:99-CV-1091(AHN) (D. Conn. Nov. 22, 1999), App. 43. Construing §1997e(a) narrowly because it is an exception \\"to the general rule of non-exhaustion in §1983 cases,\\" the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's judgment; the appeals court held that \\"exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required for [prisoner] claims of assault or excessive force brought under §1983.\\" Section 1997e(a) requires administrative exhaustion of inmates' claims \\"with respect to prison conditions,\\" but contains no definition of the words \\"prison conditions.\\" The appeals court found the term \\"scarcely free of ambiguity.\\" In conflict with the Second Circuit, other Federal Courts of Appeals have determined that prisoners alleging assaults by prison guards must meet §1997e(a)'s exhaustion requirement before commencing a civil rights action.

It was broadcast by Thames Television on 28 September 1987 After the First World War, Ernest Oppenheimer held the monopoly over the mining and sale of South West African diamonds, and formed Consolidated Diamond Mines (CDM) which was owned by De Beers. Narrative The voice-over narration begins: > Tonight we report on the dark side of the diamond industry. We show how one > of the world's richest companies has been stripping one of the world's > poorest nations of its main asset - diamonds from this mine. Namibia - a > forgotten country long denied its independence. Here for 20 years, South > Africa has ignored international law, occupied the land by force and refused > to allow the formation of a democratic government. Behind the cover of a > military occupation, Namibia has been robbed of its mineral wealth. Here a > mining company has leased the world's largest diamond workings, taken £5 > billion worth of gems and paid a rent of £130 per year. At the mouth of the > Orange River, an accident of geology and the sands of time has laid down one > of nature's rarest gifts to mankind - lonely beaches encrusted with the > finest gem diamonds in the world. Released by volcanic activity inland, the > diamonds were originally thrown into the Orange River, then over the > centuries they were washed downstream and taken to the sea. Incoming tides > put the finishing touches bringing the diamonds ashore. Interviewees In sequence, the following were interviewed in The Case of the Disappearing Diamonds: Martyn Marriott Described as a Diamond Consultant, Mr Martyn Marriott, stated: > \\"It's well known they're the finest diamonds in the world - the highest > quality, best colour, lovely diamonds. They are water-worn, thrown up into > the beach and a very nice shape. They just happen to be good quality and > good colour as well. The diamonds from Namibia are worth an average $200 per > carat whereas the diamonds from Zaïre would be worth $8 per carat.\\" Eric Lang Businessman Eric Lang said: > \\"Successive Administrator-Generals allowed the mining companies to get away > with exporting 20-25% of production without any control whatsoever.\\" Lang threatened to release Namibia's mineral statistics, to which countries they were being sold and at what prices. Lang said he believes that the plunder of his country's resources could lead to another famine in Africa, and that the people of Namibia had lost their equivalent of North Sea Oil - what would have given them a secure future. > \\"Namibia's economy is extremely sick - the government consumes 75% of GDP to > run the country which, today, is the second most indebted country on the > African continent - from a debt-free nation seven years ago. The situation > in Namibia could become far more serious than Angola and Mozambique. Without > international aid, Namibia could turn into the Ethiopia of Southern Africa.\\" Gordon Brown Former CDM manager, Gordon Brown, claimed that for 20 years De Beers had been stripping Namibia of its most precious asset - diamonds at Oranjemund. > \\"Overmining took place on the upper terraces and the 'N' blocks [in the > upper terraces, blocks K, L, and M were rich in diamonds and the richest of > all were the 'N' blocks] which were the series of beaches situated furthest > from the sea. That's where the richest blocks were in terms of grade and > stone size. There was a central block between the two major beaches that was > of lower grade. That was left behind - the company concentrated on taking > out the ore reserves furthest from the sea. That's not good mining practice. > Proper mining practice calls for the average ore reserve grade and average > stone size. I would liken this to a nice big cream cake, with a sponge cake > below. Normally you would take out a slice at a time, but in the case of > overmining the cream is completely scraped off the top.\\" John Shaedonhodi A Namibian and a CDM worker, John Shaedonhodi, said he was concerned that a future independent Namibia would be impoverished. Bernt Carlsson The man responsible for Namibia under international law, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, was asked about Namibia's diamonds:Bernt Carlsson and The Case of the Disappearing Diamonds Part 3 > \\"The corporation has been trying to skim the cream which means they have > gone for the large diamonds at the expense of the steady pace. In this way > they have really shortened the lifespan of the mines. One would expect from > a worldwide corporation like De Beers and Anglo American that they would > behave with an element of social and political responsibility. But their > behaviour in the specific case of Namibia has been one of profit maximation > regardless of its social, economic, political and even legal > responsibility.\\" The United Nations Council for Namibia enacted in 1974 a Decree for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia, under which no person or entity could search for, take or distribute any natural resources found in Namibia without the Council's permission. Any person or entity contravening the Decree could be held liable for damages by the future government of an independent Namibia. Companies like De Beers have ignored the law but now attitudes at the UN are beginning to harden: > \\"The United Nations this year [1987] in July started legal action against > one such company - the Dutch company URENCO which imports uranium.\\" Will you be taking action against other companies such as De Beers? > \\"All the companies which are carrying out activities in Namibia which have > not been authorised by the United Nations are being studied at present.\\" Thirion Report The documentary referred to a wide-ranging investigation carried out by South African Judge Pieter Willem Thirion in 1982 into political corruption and the divisive tribal structures imposed on Namibia by the apartheid government. Judge Thirion extended his investigation into the behaviour of multinational mining companies in the former German colony and found: at one mine 420,000 tonnes of ore were sent out of the country as \\"geological samples\\"; at another, the state leased the mining rights to a businessman at £1,500 per year, who then reassigned them for an income of £650,000 per year; at the British owned Tsumeb mine, lead and copper were exported with undisclosed amounts of gold and silver; and the British South West Africa Company exported £7 million worth of minerals without paying tax. Judge Thirion focused upon the stewardship of the nation's principal economic resource - gem diamonds of the Atlantic beaches north of the Orange River. The Thirion Report's main findings were: # There were no meaningful controls over Namibia's most important industry; # The premises of the supposedly independent Diamond Board for South West Africa were provided by De Beers; # All of the Board's agents were De Beers' employees; # The entire costs of running the Board were met by De Beers as a tax deductible expense; # Stanley Jackson, the Diamond Board Secretary, was also Secretary to Consolidated Diamond Mines. The 350-page report found that De Beers had overmined the diamond reserves ahead of Namibia's independence: > The excessive depletion of the deposit was a preferential depletion of the > more valuable deposits to the detriment of the low grade deposits, and > therefore a breach of the provisions of Clause 3 of the Halbscheid > Agreement. The probabilities are that the effect of the excessive depletion > of the deposit will be to shorten the life of the mine and to detrimentally > affect its profitability towards the end of its life.

Biography Edward De Robertis (a.k.a. Eddy) was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on June 6, 1947, while his father, Eduardo de Robertis, was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT. He was raised in Uruguay since age three, where he completed MD studies by age 24. This was followed by a Ph.D. in Chemistry at the Leloir Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His postdoctoral training was in Cambridge, England with Sir John Gurdon. Following three years as staff member at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, in 1980 De Robertis was appointed full Professor at the University of Basel, Switzerland. De Robertis has been the Norman Sprague Jr. Professor of Biological Chemistry at the University of California at Los Angeles since 1985, where he also is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1994. Scientific Activity De Robertis carried out his postdoctoral training (1974–1977) with Sir John Gurdon, the distinguished developmental biologist, at the Medical Research Council in the United Kingdom. By transplanting Xenopus kidney cell nuclei into oocytes of a different amphibian species, they demonstrated that nuclear reprogramming of protein-coding genes was caused by oocyte cytoplasm.De Robertis, E.M. and Gurdon, J.B. (1977). Gene Activation in somatic nuclei after injection into amphibian oocytes. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 2470-2474. In 1978 he became staff scientist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, working on the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of macromolecules. In 1984, De Robertis, together with the laboratory of his colleague Walter Gehring, isolated the first vertebrate development- controlling gene, now called Hox-C6.Carrasco, A.E., McGinnis, W., Gehring, W.J. and De Robertis, E.M.

In 1924 Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold identified a region of the amphibian embryo that was able to induce the formation of Siamese twins after transplantation. De Robertis isolated genes expressed in this region, starting with a homeobox gene called Goosecoid.Cho, K.W.Y, Blumberg, B., Steinbeisser, H. and De Robertis, E.M. (1991).

De Robertis has been active in international scientific affairs. He served as president of the International Society of Developmental Biologists (ISDB) from 2002 to 2006. During this period, ISDB sponsored the formation of the Latin American Society of Developmental Biology and the Asian-Pacific Network of Developmental Biologists. He has also served on the scientific board of the Pew Charitable Trusts Latin American Fellows program for almost two decades. Recently, De Robertis was appointed to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences by Pope Benedict XVI. In summary, Eddy De Robertis has been a pioneer in the remarkable current realization that the development of all animals is regulated by an ancestral genetic tool-kit.

The series follows Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow, a double agent for the CIA working inside of the counter-government agency SD-6. The main theme of the series explores Sydney's obligation to conceal her true career from her friends and family, even as she assumes multiple aliases to carry out her missions. These themes are most prevalent in the first two seasons of the show. A major plotline of the series is the search for and recovery of artifacts created by Milo Rambaldi, a Renaissance-era character with similarities to both Leonardo da Vinci and Nostradamus. On May 22, 2006 the series completed its run, airing a total of 105 episodes over five seasons. An animated short was included on the DVD release of season 3.

Founded in 2008, the school serves students in kindergarten through Grade 8. History Kona Pacific Public Charter School was established by an act of the Charter School Review Panel in July 2008 and opened its doors to students that Fall. Kona Pacific serves a student body that is representative of the diversity of the South Kona community that it serves. Each year, Kona Pacific provides educational services to 230 students, as well as important supplemental social services to more than 100 school families. Kona Pacific’s 98% historical enrollment clearly demonstrate the school’s success at providing academic and learning support services to the community. These enrollment figures would be considered outstanding for any school, but are extraordinary for a period that includes the founding year, with subsequent annual growth of at least 25%. Throughout that time, student retention averaged 88%, also an extremely high figure in a state with a very transient population and resultant student attrition. This is also an indicator of the high level of parent satisfaction with the school. In its first 9 years of operation, Kona Pacific has also become a state pioneer in the field of school and community nutrition. In Fall 2012, Hawaii Island’s nutrition program vendor ceased operations with just 30 days notice. As the only federally approved food service vendor for nutrition programs in West Hawai‘i, their closure endangered the health and well-being of 450 impoverished citizens, mostly young children and elders. Kona Pacific immediately responded to this emergency need by developing their W.H.O.L.E. Foodservice program in time to ensure that no at-risk residents went hungry. The school also operates Hawaii's only mobile Summer Lunch Program, providing daily meals for vulnerable island children for whom hunger doesn't take a summer break. Since the program's launch in June 2015, Kona Pacific has served more than 22,000 lunches to at-risk children at 10 sites throughout West Hawaii. Campus The Kona Pacific campus is located on surrounded by fields and forests. The campus is a beautiful, safe open space for children to learn and play. Curriculum Kona Pacific Public Charter School offers a comprehensive education that weaves together three strands: * A holistic, hands-on, project based Waldorf education, promoting student achievement in language arts, math, science, visual arts, foreign languages, musical training and movement; * An educational program that embraces the values of Hawaiian culture, with particular focus on environmental education and community sustainability through understanding and respect for the people, land and sea of Hawai'i; and * A curriculum rich in the life-sustaining practices of farming and gardening that are a vital part of Hawai‘i Island life.

The Security Council noted the strong improvement of the situation in most regions of Somalia by UNOSOM II, acknowledging that the Somali people themselves were responsible for the reconciliation and reconstruction of their country, the highest priority for UNOSOM II, but stressed that the international community wanted to assist in the process. The General Agreement signed on 8 January 1993 in Addis Ababa and the Addis Ababa Agreement of the Conference on National Reconciliation on 27 March, for the Council, provided a solid basis for a solution. In that context, disarmament was crucial to peace and stability, though the Council condemned the continuing violence and attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers and the situation as a whole remained a threat to peace and security in the region. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to report to the Security Council by 15 January 1994 on developments and an updated plan with the future strategy of the mission, with the Council deciding to undertake a review of the UNOSOM II mission by 1 February 1994 after receiving the report. All parties, factions and movements in Somalia were called to abide by the ceasefire and disarmament agreements and accelerate their efforts to achieve political reconciliation. It was important in this regard that concrete goals had to be achieved, including the creation of district and regional councils and an interim national authority. Additionally, the establishment of an operational police and legal system was important to this process. The parties were reminded that the further involvement of the United Nations depended on their co-operation to find a solution. The diplomatic efforts of the Member States and international organisations to include all factions to the negotiating table was praised. The Council reaffirmed that all countries should continue to observe the arms embargo against Somalia imposed in Resolution 733 (1992) while expressing concern at the destabilising effects of cross-border arms flows in the region in relation to the security of other countries. The Council stressed the link between rehabilitation and reconciliation, and encouraged donors to continue contributing to rehabilitation projects in areas where security and reconciliation were brought about. States were also encouraged to provide more troops, equipment, money to the process of national reconciliation in Somalia and asked for support to strengthen UNOSUM II.

She rubbed shoulders with figures such as George Washington and Dolley Madison. Life Anna Maria was probably born in England and emigrated at a young age along with her mother, Ann Brodeau, who moved to Philadelphia and set up a schoolhouse by 1780.(the Brodeaus appear in the 1780 census) In 1790, at the age of 16, Anna Maria married William Thornton, age 31 years. Unlike her husband, Anna Maria was not a Quaker, so William was expelled from the Society of Friends.(Anna Maria Brodeau Thornton, account of her husband's life, 1828, William Thornton Papers, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) William Thornton came from a slaveholding family based on the island of Tortola, and after he died in 1828, though his will seemed to grant freedom to his slaves, his wife and mother-in- law continued to reside with slaves in their Washington, D.C. home.William Thornton will, Washington, D.C. Historic events Thornton's diaries are kept in the Library of Congress and have been used as a source concerning several historic events. After the death of George Washington, Mrs. Thornton lobbied Congress on behalf of her friend Martha Washington, concerning the planned re-burial of the former president in Washington, D.C.Roberts, p. 5 She met with Abigail Adams three days after the new president and first lady moved to Washington.Roberts, p. 43 She recorded the movements of Dolley Madison during the 1814 burning of Washington.Roberts, p. 270 Bowen incident One night in 1835, one of her slaves, John Arthur Bowen (possibly under the influence of alcohol), ventured into the bedroom of Anna Maria Thornton, then about 60, wielding an axe.(Anna Maria Thornton diary, Library of Congress) Fortunately, Anna and her mother, who shared her room, both escaped unscathed. However, Bowen was arrested and faced the possibility of hanging.(Thornton diary) In response to the abortive attack, white residents of Washington rioted, burning a black school, amid other acts of destruction.(The Secret City: A History of Race Relations in the Nation's Capital by Constance McLaughlin Green; Thornton diary) The capital's restrictive \\"black codes\\" were also tightened in response to the incident.(Green, The Secret City) Despite Bowen's threat to her life, Anna Maria Brodeau Thornton was tormented by his imprisonment - especially after he wrote her a letter about awful jail conditions (this letter is still in the Anna Maria Brodeau Thornton papers at the Library of Congress) and went to extraordinary lengths to try to get him pardoned. Her diary chronicles how she appealed to many powerful Washington men at the time, such as Congressman and future Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson - who, ironically enough, considered a slave woman to be his common- law wife. She also appealed to military men such as Gen. George Gibson, former Quartermaster General, who was a close personal friend of President Andrew Jackson, and to a member of the Washington family.(Anna Maria Brodeau Thornton petition to Andrew Jackson, 1835; http://www.qmfound.com/COL_George_Gibson.htm ) The widow Thornton presented a petition signed by numerous Washington notables to President Jackson, in person, and he acted on it on the symbolic date of July 4th, 1836, releasing Bowen from confinement.(Thornton diary) Thornton immediately sold Bowen to John Henry Eaton to work on a flatboat in Florida. In her petition to Jackson, Thornton consistently described Bowen as a \\"boy,\\" though he was about 19, and she speculated that he had been under the influence of drink. In other words, he had not \\"really\\" attacked her; it was not him doing the acting, but merely the \\"demon rum.\\" The modern writer Jefferson Morley has suggested that the sale of Bowen was meant to get him out of Washington, where many angry whites still hated him for his alleged violence and his criticisms of slavery. Morley also notes the possibility that Thornton was so forgiving and protective of the young slave because he may have been William Thornton's son. Graves of Anna (left) and William Thornton at the Congressional Cemetery. After Bowen's release from jail and subsequent sale, Anna Maria Brodeau Thornton went about her daily life, finally freeing her few remaining slaves shortly before her death in 1865 (in which year they would have been freed, anyway, with the end of the American Civil War). Her diary, which is a rich source of information about social life in Washington, D.C., in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries, is available at the Library of Congress.

Founded by the Quebec government in 1944, it became the second North American music institution of higher learning to be entirely state-subsidized. The conservatoire is part of a network of 7 conservatories in Quebec, the Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Québec (CMADQ), and was the second school in the CMADQ network to be established. Orchestra conductor Wilfrid Pelletier served as the school's first director from 1944 through 1946. The current director is Louis Dallaire. At its founding, the CMQQ was located on Langelier Blvd, moving in 1950 to larger premises on Saint Denis Street near the Citadelle of Quebec. In October 1972 the CMQQ moved to its current home inside the Grand Théâtre de Québec. In 1991, the complex housed 49 classrooms, 70 teaching and practice studios, a multi-media centre with a recording studio and electroacoustic lab, and the performance space of the theatre itself. The complex is also home to an impressive library which in 1991 included more than 60,000 documents of books, scores, monographs, periodicals, and recordings in various media formats. The CMQQ has a strong commitment to performance, and in addition to holding public concerts at the Grand Théâtre they also perform regularly at the nearby Salle Louis-Fréchette and Salle Octave-Crémazie performance halls, the Chapelle historique du Bon-Pasteur museum, and the Institut canadien de Québec. Both students and faculty regularly present public recitals in these venues, in addition to the many public concerts given by the school's orchestra, chamber orchestra, jazz band, wind ensemble, opera program, choirs, and other performance groups. The school offers courses in well over 50 areas of study, ranging from early music performance studies to electroacoustic music techniques, to chamber music, to ethnomusicology, and opera and jazz studies among many others. The school also regularly brings in guest instructors for master classes which are also open to the music students of Laval University. History Claude Champagne (left) and Wilfrid Pelletier (right) at the opening of the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal in 1943. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Canadian composer Claude Champagne put together a large report on music education. This report was presented to the Quebec government by Champagne and Wilfrid Pelletier with the hopes of establishing Canadian institutes of higher learning for music. The report closely examined music education in Europe as well as in Canada and plans were soon formed to establish a network of state-subsidized school which would be modeled after European conservatories, particularly the Conservatoire de Paris. On 29 May 1942 The Conservatory Act ('Loi du conservatoire') was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec which allocated a $30,000 budget to form the CMADQ's first school, the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal (CMQM). The CMQM opened its doors in January 1943 with Pelletier as the school's first director and Champagne its first assistant director. With the successful opening of the CMQM, the CMADQ, under Pelletier's leadership, began plans to establish a similar conservatory in Quebec City. These plans were swiftly carried out and the school's first day of classes occurred on 17 January 1944. Most of the conservatoire's original faculty were also teachers at the CMQM and commuted back and forth between the two schools during its early years. Henri Gagnon succeeded Pelletier as the school's second director in 1946 with organ professor Alice Duchesnay remaining on as the school's assistant director. Notable early staff members included Gilbert Darisse (violin), Maurice DeCelles (oboe), René Gagnieer (clarinet, trombone), Olga Gosselin (harp), Hélène Landry (piano), and Robert Talbot (theory) among others. In 1961 Raoul Jobin succeeded Gagnon as director, and nine years later he was in turn succeeded by Paul-Émile Talbot in 1970. Armando Santiago served as director from 1978–1985, followed by Jean Charron (1985–1988) and Wilfrand Guillemette (1988-?).

Generally the movies are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts. Some Indian ghost movies, such as the comedy/horror film Chandramukhi, have been great hits, dubbed into several languages. They usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore, but in some cases are remakes of Western movies, such as Anjaane, based on Alejandro Amenábar's ghost story The Others. Box office hits The 1949 Mahal (Hindi: महल; Urdu: محل; English: The Mansion) was a groundbreaking Hindi language movie directed by Kamal Amrohi and starring Ashok Kumar and Madhubala, one of the earliest known Bollywood films dealing with reincarnation. Mahal became one of the biggest box office hits of 1949 in India.Mahal (1949) Classic Films at upperstall The movie paved the way for Indian gothic fiction. Chandramukhi (Tamil: சந்திரமுகி; Telugu: చంద్రముఖి; Hindi: चंद्रमुखी) (2005) is a horror, comedy and drama film directed by P. Vasu and produced by Ramkumar Ganesan. The soundtrack and background score for the film, which later became successful enough to be released as a separate album, was written by Vidyasagar. It was later dubbed into several languages, and became one of the highest grossing Tamil film ever. Chandramukhi is a remake of the 2004 Kannada film Apthamitra, which was the highest grossing Kannada film in recent times. The movie tells of the experiences of a married couple who buy an ancient palace in Mysore that turns out to be haunted. Apthamitra itself was a remake of the successful 1993 Malayalam film Manichitrathazhu directed by Fazil and written by Madhu Muttam. Common themes The ghost movies often concern modern people unexpectedly involved in the ghostly results of past events. Bhoot (Hindi: भूत, English: Ghost) (2003) was directed by Ram Gopal Varma and starring Urmila Matondkar and Ajay Devgan. A couple takes an apartment that turns out to have a horrifying past. A series of inexplicable experiences drives the wife to near madness. Bhoot was perceived to be different from a typical Bollywood movie as it did not contain songs. Krishna Cottage (2004) starring Sohail Khan, Natassha, and Ishaa Koppikar is a horror story that includes ghosts, death, reincarnation, and love, revolving around a fictional book \\"Kayi Unkahi Batein\\" (a few untold things) by Professor Siddharth Das (Rajendranath Zutshi). Some have a more philosophical theme. In Hum Tum Aur Ghost, starring Arshad Warsi and Dia Mirza, the hero is a charming fashion photographer whose life is marred by the fact that he hears voices that nobody else can hear, which disrupts his social life. He becomes aware of his special ability to connect with the souls that haven't crossed over, and sets out on a journey where he assists three souls, in the process learning much about himself. Adaptations from Indian literature Indian ghost movies are often based on Indian novels or short stories about ghosts. Anandabhadram (Malayalam: അനന്തഭദ്രം) is a Malayalam film released in 2005 about ghosts, spirits, and black magic, based on the award-winning novel of the same name by Sunil Parameswaran. It is the first Malayalam venture of Indian director Santosh Sivan as well as of Bengali model/actress Riya Sen. The story of Ananthabhadram is a fairy tale. Set in rural Kerala, the tale is dominated by black magicians, martial arts experts, sorcerers and seductresses. Sivan said \\"it was the story of Ananthabhadram that captivated me. The stories my grandmother used to tell me used to take me to a world of mystery. It was the same feeling when I heard this story and I have tried to capture that in my film.\\" Paheli (Devanagari: पहेली, Nastaliq: پہیلی, ) (2005) was directed by Amol Palekar and produced by Gauri Khan, Sanjiv Chawla and Shahrukh Khan, who also plays the male lead. It is based on the short story written by Vijayadan Detha and tells the story of a wife (Rani Mukerji) who is left by her husband (Shahrukh Khan) and visited by a ghost, disguised as her husband, who is in love with her and takes her husband's place. Duvidha (1973) was directed by Mani Kaul and was critically acclaimed and won Best Film at the 1974 Filmfare Awards. The film is based on a story by Vijayadan Detha which relates a popular folktale from Rajasthan about merchant’s son whose relationship with his young bride is thwarted by his work and a ghost who falls in love with her, resulting in the ghost soon impersonating the husband. Shodh (1981) is based on the book Steaming Rice and a Ghost Story by Sunil Gangopadhyay. Surendra (Om Puri), having been exiled from his village in youth and established himself in the city, comes back to the news of his father's demise, reportedly at the hands of a phantom. He announces a prize for anyone who succeeds in showing him a ghost, which attracts the greed of the poor hungry peasants, resulting in the accusations of innocent people as haunted and even murders with the hope of producing a ghost. Adaptations from Western sources Some Bollywood ghost movies are adapted from Western sources, with varying degrees of success. The 2003 Saaya (Hindi: साया, Urdu: سایا, translation: Shadow) is a direct lift of the 2002 Hollywood film Dragonfly. Raaz (Hindi: राज़, Urdu: راز, translation: Secret) (2002) directed by Vikram Bhatt, is an unofficial Bollywood adaptation of the 2000 film What Lies Beneath. The film is based on the story of a couple who have moved to Ooty to save their failing marriage. However, what they find in their new home is more than they expected when a ghost starts haunting the place. Sanjana suddenly finds that her husband is part of the ghostly conspiracy, which she must fix in order to escape. Anjaane (2005) starred Manisha Koirala, Sanjay Kapoor, Tejasvini Kolhapure and Helen. The film was based on Alejandro Amenábar's ghost story The Others starring Nicole Kidman. The film was criticized for being a copycat of the American version and the acting of Koirala was described by reviewers as \\"uninterested\\" and \\"mechanical\\". Bhoothnath (Devanagari: भूतनाथ translation: \\"Lord of Ghosts\\") directed by Vivek Sharma and produced by Ravi Chopra, is an adaptation of the Oscar Wilde short-story The Canterville Ghost. The story is about the relationship between a deceased old man (played by Amitabh Bachchan) and a boy named Banku. Influence on Western movies Some Hollywood movies refer to Bollywood ghost movies. For example, the 2001 movie Ghost World by Terry Zwigoff includes a clip from the 1965 hit Gumnaam by Raja Nawathe, which tells of a group of travelers in an isolated hotel who are murdered one by one. Gumnaam itself borrows from Agatha Christie's detective fiction novel And Then There Were None.

The Japanese Problem, also referred to as the Japanese Menace or the Japanese Conspiracy, was the name given to racial tensions in Hawaii between the European-American sugarcane plantation owners and the Japanese immigrants hired to work in the cane fields. Origins The term \\"Japanese Problem\\" came into use during the 1920 Oahu Sugar Strike. Following the strike, powerful European-Americans like Walter Dillingham and Harry Baldwin were vocal about their concerns regarding the increasing Japanese population in Hawaii. They worried that the increasing Japanese population would eventually affect politics in Hawaii as the voter base changed. Ultimately, they were most concerned that the Japanese were loyal to Japan, and would allow the Japanese Empire to claim Hawaii. Wallace Farrington pointed out in a speech in 1920 that even though the strikes were caused by \\"malcontents and agitators\\", the Japanese had to be given the chance to Americanize.

By March 2013, it was no longer in production. The single-pickup ES-175s were first introduced in 1949 but were discontinued around 1971 although small custom runs including the ES-175CC (with a Charlie Christian reproduction pickup) were made. Herb's original 1953 ES-175 originally came with a single P-90 pickup in the neck position. This was replaced with Gibson humbucker in order to address some feedback issues. The ES-165 debuted in 1991 (first model shipped was February 27, 1991), as Gibson's tribute to longtime ES-175 user Herb Ellis. It featured a Gibson 490R humbucker and a single tone and volume control mounted directly to the top. In 2004 the humbucker was replaced with a Gibson BJB Floating humbucker and the tone control was removed. The volume was moved to the surface of the pickguard.  Features  This guitar features a 24¾\\" scale neck with 20 frets, joined at the 14th fret. The width at the nut is 1 11/16 inches. The bound fingerboard is rosewood with parallelogram markers. The early variant of this guitar features what Gibson refers to as a \\"rounded Jazz profile\\". This would be somewhat thicker than the standard neck dimensions. This neck profile would be changed to the standard profile in 2004. The body is fully hollow with two internal lateral braces. Like the ES-175, it measures 16\\" across the lower bout and 3½ inches deep at the outer rims. Unlike Herb's original 1953 ES-175, the top and back laminate material consist of a figured maple top followed by poplar and another maple laminate. The original model would have been made of plain maple/basswood/maple. Hardware includes a zigzag trapeze tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic bridge mounted on a rosewood base. While the Tune- O-Matic bridge is branded as a Gibson part, the zigzag tailpiece is not and is most likely not an American-made part. There have also been several reports of this tailpiece failing at the hinge. All models of ES-165 feature gold plated hardware including \\"Tulip\\" Grover tuners (branded either as Gibson or Grover). The ES-165 was originally released with a single 490R humbucker, one volume control (300k Linear taper) and one tone control (500K audio with a .022 microfarad ceramic disc capacitor.) In 2004 the 490R humbucker was replaced with a Gibson BJB Floating humbucker and the tone control was removed. The volume was moved to the surface of the pickguard. On all variants the pickguard is a three-ply black/white/black beveled pickguard. Finally, instead of having the Gibson logo and crown inlaid on the headstock, a gold Gibson logo was stenciled with Herb Ellis' signature stenciled below it. The reason for putting the signature on the headstock instead of the trussrod cover was that Herb Ellis often removed the cover to install a Van Eps String Damper .In the 2004 variant the inlaid logo and crown return with Herb Ellis' name embossed on the trussrod cover. The earliest ES-165s shipped did not have Herb Ellis' signature on the headstock. This was added only after November, 1991. In 1999 Gibson's Epiphone product line presented the Zephyr Regent guitar. Similar in size and construction to the ES-165, it differs in having a laminated mahogany back and sides and dot inlays on the fingerboard.  References  *Ingram, Adrian.

Although there are other techniques such as Kahan summation that typically have even smaller round-off errors, pairwise summation is nearly as good (differing only by a logarithmic factor) while having much lower computational cost--it can be implemented so as to have nearly the same cost (and exactly the same number of arithmetic operations) as naive summation. In particular, pairwise summation of a sequence of n numbers xn works by recursively breaking the sequence into two halves, summing each half, and adding the two sums: a divide and conquer algorithm. Its worst-case roundoff errors grow asymptotically as at most O(ε log n), where ε is the machine precision (assuming a fixed condition number, as discussed below). In comparison, the naive technique of accumulating the sum in sequence (adding each xi one at a time for i = 1, ..., n) has roundoff errors that grow at worst as O(εn). Kahan summation has a worst-case error of roughly O(ε), independent of n, but requires several times more arithmetic operations. If the roundoff errors are random, and in particular have random signs, then they form a random walk and the error growth is reduced to an average of O(\\\\varepsilon \\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}) for pairwise summation.Manfred Tasche and Hansmartin Zeuner Handbook of Analytic-Computational Methods in Applied Mathematics Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2000). A very similar recursive structure of summation is found in many fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, and is responsible for the same slow roundoff accumulation of those FFTs.S. G. Johnson and M. Frigo, \\"Implementing FFTs in practice, in Fast Fourier Transforms, edited by C. Sidney Burrus (2008). The algorithm In pseudocode, the pairwise summation algorithm for an array of length > 0 can be written: s = pairwise(x[1…n]) if n ≤ N base case: naive summation for a sufficiently small array s = x[1] for i = 2 to n s = s + x[i] else divide and conquer: recursively sum two halves of the array m = floor(n / 2) s = pairwise(x[1…m]) + pairwise(x[m+1…n]) end if The non-recursive version of the algorithm uses a stack to accumulate partial sums: partials = new Stack for i = 1 to n partials.push(x[i]) j = i while is_even(j) j = floor(j / 2) p = partials.pop() q = partials.pop() partials.push(p + q) total = 0.0 while partials.size > 0 total = total + partials.pop() return total For some sufficiently small , this algorithm switches to a naive loop-based summation as a base case, whose error bound is O(Nε). The entire sum has a worst-case error that grows asymptotically as O(ε log n) for large n, for a given condition number (see below). In an algorithm of this sort (as for divide and conquer algorithms in generalRadu Rugina and Martin Rinard, \\"Recursion unrolling for divide and conquer programs,\\" in Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing, chapter 3, pp. 34–48. Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol. 2017 (Berlin: Springer, 2001).), it is desirable to use a larger base case in order to amortize the overhead of the recursion. If N = 1, then there is roughly one recursive subroutine call for every input, but more generally there is one recursive call for (roughly) every N/2 inputs if the recursion stops at exactly n = N. By making N sufficiently large, the overhead of recursion can be made negligible (precisely this technique of a large base case for recursive summation is employed by high-performance FFT implementations). Regardless of N, exactly n−1 additions are performed in total, the same as for naive summation, so if the recursion overhead is made negligible then pairwise summation has essentially the same computational cost as for naive summation. A variation on this idea is to break the sum into b blocks at each recursive stage, summing each block recursively, and then summing the results, which was dubbed a \\"superblock\\" algorithm by its proposers.Anthony M. Castaldo, R. Clint Whaley, and Anthony T. Chronopoulos, \\"Reducing floating-point error in dot product using the superblock family of algorithms,\\" SIAM J. Sci. Comput., vol. 32, pp. 1156–1174 (2008). The above pairwise algorithm corresponds to b = 2 for every stage except for the last stage which is b = N. Accuracy Suppose that one is summing n values xi, for i = 1, ..., n. The exact sum is: :S_n = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (computed with infinite precision). With pairwise summation for a base case N = 1, one instead obtains S_n + E_n, where the error E_n is bounded above by: :E_n \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon \\\\log_2 n}{1 - \\\\varepsilon \\\\log_2 n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i where ε is the machine precision of the arithmetic being employed (e.g. ε ≈ 10−16 for standard double precision floating point). Usually, the quantity of interest is the relative error E_n/S_n, which is therefore bounded above by: :\\\\frac{E_n}{S_n} \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon \\\\log_2 n}{1 - \\\\varepsilon \\\\log_2 n} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{\\\\left \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\right}\\\\right). In the expression for the relative error bound, the fraction (Σxi/Σxi) is the condition number of the summation problem. Essentially, the condition number represents the intrinsic sensitivity of the summation problem to errors, regardless of how it is computed.L. N. Trefethen and D. Bau, Numerical Linear Algebra (SIAM: Philadelphia, 1997). The relative error bound of every (backwards stable) summation method by a fixed algorithm in fixed precision (i.e. not those that use arbitrary-precision arithmetic, nor algorithms whose memory and time requirements change based on the data), is proportional to this condition number. An ill-conditioned summation problem is one in which this ratio is large, and in this case even pairwise summation can have a large relative error. For example, if the summands xi are uncorrelated random numbers with zero mean, the sum is a random walk and the condition number will grow proportional to \\\\sqrt{n}. On the other hand, for random inputs with nonzero mean the condition number asymptotes to a finite constant as n\\\\to\\\\infty. If the inputs are all non-negative, then the condition number is 1. Note that the 1 - \\\\varepsilon \\\\log_2 n denominator is effectively 1 in practice, since \\\\varepsilon \\\\log_2 n is much smaller than 1 until n becomes of order 21/ε, which is roughly 101015 in double precision. In comparison, the relative error bound for naive summation (simply adding the numbers in sequence, rounding at each step) grows as O(\\\\varepsilon n) multiplied by the condition number. In practice, it is much more likely that the rounding errors have a random sign, with zero mean, so that they form a random walk; in this case, naive summation has a root mean square relative error that grows as O(\\\\varepsilon \\\\sqrt{n}) and pairwise summation has an error that grows as O(\\\\varepsilon \\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}) on average. Software implementations Pairwise summation is the default summation algorithm in NumPyENH: implement pairwise summation, github.com/numpy/numpy pull request #3685 (September 2013). and the Julia technical-computing language,RFC: use pairwise summation for sum, cumsum, and cumprod, github.com/JuliaLang/julia pull request #4039 (August 2013). where in both cases it was found to have comparable speed to naive summation (thanks to the use of a large base case).

The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had reported that the peace process in El Salvador had advanced, an announcement welcomed by the Council. However, concern was expressed at the delay in issues relating to the transfer of land, reintegration of ex-combatants, deployment of new police and the recommendations of the Commission on the Truth. There was also concern about recent violence and its implications for the peace process and the elections of March 1994, which may negatively affect the peace process if left unchecked. Investigations by the Secretary-General and the Government of El Salvador into illegal armed groups and their possible association with the violence was welcomed. At the same time, the Security Council was concerned about the politically motivated murders of members of parties including the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) and the Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (ARENA). For the Council, El Salvador was in a critical phase and indicated that the elections should be held in a free, fair and peaceful atmosphere. In this regard, statements the presidential candidates concerning peace and stability were welcomed. The Security Council condemned the recent violence in the country and the partial implementation of important acts of the peace agreement, calling on the Government of El Salvador and FMLN to make efforts to prevent political violence and fulfill their obligations under the peace accords. Support was reaffirmed for the Secretary-General, in co- operation with the Government of El Salvador concerning the opening of an investigation into illegal armed groups in El Salvador. All parties were also urged to co-operate with the Secretary-General's Special Representative and ONUSAL in implementing the peace accords. The need to recover weapons from private individuals in opposition to the peace accords was stressed, while remaining issues relating to the implementation of a land transfer programme and reintegration programmes for ex-combatants from both sides were urged to be resolved. After extending ONUSAL's mandate until 31 May 1994, the Council concluded by requesting the Secretary-General to report on developments in El Salvador and the operations of ONUSAL so that its size and mandate could be reviewed for the period after the end of its current mandate.

His commentary, completed in 429, became integral to later editions of the Sanguozhi, making the joint work three times as long as the original.Yuet Keung Lo, \\"Pei Songzhi\\", in A Global Encyclopedia of Historical Writing, edited by D. R. Woolf (Garland Reference Library, 1998), p. 701. Two of his descendants, Pei Yin (裴駰) and Pei Ziye (裴子野), were also well known historians. Life Pei was born in a family of officials who served in the Eastern Jin government. His grandfather, Pei Mei (裴昧), served as a Household Counsellor (光祿大夫) while his father, Pei Gui (裴珪), was a zheng yuanwailang (正員外郎). Pei was fond of reading since his childhood, and he was already very familiar with classic texts such as the Analects of Confucius and the Classic of Poetry at the age of eight. In 391, during the reign of Emperor Xiaowu, Pei became a Palace General (殿中將軍) at the age of 20. In 398, during the reign of Emperor An, Pei's uncle, Yu Kai (庾楷), who was the Governor of Yu Province, allied with Wang Gong (王恭), the Governor of Yan and Qing provinces, to attack the imperial capital, Jiankang. They were defeated. Yu Kai fled to join the warlord Huan Xuan, after which he nominated Pei to be the Administrator of Xinye, but Pei considered the dangers of joining his uncle and refused to move there. War broke out between the warlords later and Yu Kai was killed by Huan Xuan. Pei survived because he did not join Yu Kai. In the early fifth century, Pei served as a Regular Mounted Attendant (散騎侍郎) and later as the prefect (縣令) of Guzhang County. He was recalled to the imperial court later and was promoted to shangshu ci bu lang (尚書祠部郎; a ceremonial official). In 416, the Jin imperial court ordered Liu Yu, the Duke of Song, to lead a campaign against the state of Later Qin. Pei was serving as a registrar (主簿) then when he was ordered to join Liu Yu's army. Liu Yu was very impressed with Pei and praised him as a talented person, and then appointed him as zhizhong congshi shi (治中從事史). After Liu Yu's forces occupied Luoyang, Liu Yu appointed Pei as a xianma (洗馬) to assist the heir apparent of his dukedom. Liu Yu usurped the throne in 420 and ended the Eastern Jin dynasty. He founded the Liu Song dynasty and became historically known as \\"Emperor Wu of Liu Song\\". Pei took up various appointments in the Liu Song government, including Secretary of the Interior (內史) of Lingling, State Academician (國子博士) and rongcong puye (冗從僕射). In 426, Emperor Wu's successor, Emperor Wen, sent officials to inspect the various provinces. Pei was sent to inspect Xiangzhou (湘州). After returning from his trip, Pei drafted 24 clauses based on his observations. He was promoted to Palace Gentleman Writer (中書侍郎) and Grand Judge (大中正) of Si and Ji provinces, and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Xi District (西鄉侯). In his later years, Pei served as the Administrator of Yongjia (永嘉), tongzhi sanqi changshi (通直散騎常侍), and Administrator of South Langya (南琅邪). Pei retired from service at the age of 65 in 437. However, not long later, he was recalled back to the imperial court, and he served as Attendant Counsellor (中散大夫), State Academician (國子博士), and Palace Counsellor (太中大夫). He died of illness at the age of 80 in 451. Works Emperor Wen of the Liu Song dynasty felt that the historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), written by Chen Shou in the third century, was too brief, so he commissioned Pei to make annotations to the text. Pei collected various sources, including those previously rejected by Chen Shou, and added them to the Sanguozhi, while making annotations and adding his personal commentary as well. His commentary, completed in 429, became integral to later editions of the Sanguozhi, making the joint work three times as long as the original. Emperor Wen praised his work as \\"immortal\\". Apart from making annotations to the Sanguozhi, Pei also wrote other books such as the Jin Ji (晉紀; History of Jin), Pei Shi Jiazhuan (裴氏家傳; Pei Family Biographies), and Ji Zhu Sang Fu Jing Zhuan (集注喪服經傳).

Biography Bozveliev was born in Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the Ottoman Empire, to the family of Bulgarian tobacco merchant Tenyo Bozveli. On his father's side, Bozveliev descended from the cleric and Bulgarian National Revival figure Neofit Bozveli. He attended a school in Kazanlak, even though he dropped out to find a job, he continued his studies and learned Russian and French by himself. As a young radical, Bozveliev became active in Spiro Gulabchev's underground siromahomilstvo (\\"compassion on the poor\\") movement (a movement inspired by nihilist, anarchist, narodnik and Ukrainian federalist ideas). The movement was crushed by the regime in 1890. After the crack-down, Bozveliev took part in the Tarnovo meeting of socialists in May 1891, where the foundation of a socialist party was discussed. However, Bozveliev and Sava Mutafov (another former siromahomilstvo activist) opposed the foundation of a new party, as they were wary of government repression. The foundation of the party was postponed to a second meeting the same year. On 2 August 1891 the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party was founded, with Bozveliev as one of its twenty founders.Pundeff, Marin. Marxism in Bulgaria before 1891, published in Slavic Review, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Sep., 1971), pp. 523-550 When the Bulgarian social democrats were divided in 1903, Bozveliev sided with Yanko Sakazov and joined his Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party (Broad Socialists). In 1908 Bozveliev was elected mayor of Kazanlak (as a candidate of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party (Broad Socialists)), the first Bulgarian socialist to be elected to the office of mayor.Linden, Marcel van der, and Jürgen Rojahn.

Modern materials such as concrete and plastic are also used and some clay tiles have a waterproof glaze. Roof tiles are 'hung' from the framework of a roof by fixing them with nails. The tiles are usually hung in parallel rows, with each row overlapping the row below it to exclude rainwater and to cover the nails that hold the row below. There are also roof tiles for special positions, particularly where the planes of the several pitches meet. They include ridge, hip and valley tiles. These can either be bedded and pointed in cement mortar or mechanically fixed. Similarly to roof tiling, tiling has been used to provide a protective weather envelope to the sides of timber frame buildings. These are hung on laths nailed to wall timbers, with tiles specially molded to cover corners and jambs. Often these tiles are shaped at the exposed end to give a decorative effect. Another form of this is the so-called mathematical tile, which was hung on laths, nailed and then grouted. This form of tiling gives an imitation of brickwork and was developed to give the appearance of brick, but avoided the brick taxes of the 18th century.RW Brunskill, Illustrated Handbook of Vernacular Architecture (1970:58-61) Slate roof tiles were traditional in some areas near sources of supply, and gave thin and light tiles when the slate was split into its natural layers. It is no longer a cheap material, however, and is now less common.  Shapes (profiles)  Ancient Greek roof tiles A large number of shapes (or \\"profiles\\") of roof tiles have evolved. These include: * Flat tiles – the simplest type, which are laid in regular overlapping rows. An example of this is the clay-made \\"beaver-tail\\" tile (German '), common in Southern Germany. Flat roof tiles are usually made of clay but also may be made of stone, wood, plastic, concrete, or solar cells. *Plain Clay Tiles - The size of the plain clay tile 10.5\\"x6.5\\" or 265mm x 165mm was originally defined by statute in 1477 during the reign of Edward IV. These are double lap tiles made originally from clay but more recently in concrete. They are specified generally for their aesthetic properties. The colour were generated through the control of the kiln atmosphere to generate either red, brown or blue tiles depending on the degree of reduction in the kiln. Some tiles are still manufactured in this traditional way. * Imbrex and tegula – an ancient Roman pattern of curved and flat tiles that make rain channels on a roof. * Roman tiles – flat in the middle, with a concave curve at one end and a convex curve at the other, to allow interlocking. * Pantiles – with an S-shaped profile, allowing adjacent tiles to interlock. These result in a ridged pattern resembling a ploughed field. An example of this is the \\"double Roman\\" tile, dating from the late 19th century in England and US. * Monk and Nun tiles, also called mission or barrel tiles – semi-cylindrical tiles laid in alternating columns of convex and concave tiles. Originally they were made by forming clay around a curved surface, often a log or the maker's thigh. Today barrel tiles are mass-produced from clay, metal, concrete or plastic. * Interlocking roof tiles – similar to pantiles with side and top locking to improve protection from water and wind. * Antefixes – vertical blocks which terminate the covering tiles of a tiled roof.

Although house models from Indus Valley Civilization show that the houses were flat roofed , Harappan sites such as Alamgirpur (dated 2600-2200 BCE) provide evidence of roof tiles. Fired roof-tiles occur from as early as the 3rd millennium BC in the Early Helladic House of the tiles in Lerna, Greece.Joseph W.

They were rather bulky affairs, weighing around apieceWilliam Rostoker; Elizabeth Gebhard, p. 212 \\\\- more expensive and labour-intensive to produce than thatch. Their introduction has been explained by their greatly enhanced fire-resistance, which gave desired protection to the costly temples.Örjan Wikander, p. 289 The spread of the roof-tile technique has to be viewed in connection with the simultaneous rise of monumental architecture in ancient Greece. Only the newly appearing stone walls, which were replacing the earlier mudbrick and wood walls, were strong enough to support the weight of a tiled roof.Marilyn Y. Goldberg, p. 309 As a side-effect, it has been assumed that the new stone and tile construction also ushered in the end of 'Chinese roof' (Knickdach) construction in Greek architecture, as they made the need for an extended roof as rain protection for the mudbrick walls obsolete.Marilyn Y. Goldberg, p. 305 Production of Dutch roof tiles started in the 14th century when city rulers (Holland) required the use of fireproof materials. At the time, most houses were made of wood and had thatch roofing, which would often cause fires to spread quickly. To satisfy demand, many small roof-tile makers began to produce roof tiles by hand. Many of these small factories were built near rivers where there was a ready source of clay and cheap transport. Tilehanging Tilehanging in Weybridge, Surrey Tilehanging or vertical tiling is the construction of a building with roof tiles hung vertically on the sides of the building. It is a popular style used in vernacular and neo-vernacular architecture in Britain. In China A roof in Hainan tiled using imbrices and tegulae In China, roof tiles are in use throughout the country on temples and village houses. Both imbrex and tegula and mission tiles are used. Temples typically use glazed, often ornate tiles and antefixes. The most common traditional colour is orange-yellow. Old buildings mainly have simple, clay tiles that have been fired in a kiln. Tiled roofs, while once ubiquitous in China, are now used less. One reason for this is that the majority of new houses and apartment buildings in China are built with flat roofs. Solar tiles Dow Chemical Company began producing solar roof tiles in 2005, and several other manufacturers followed suit. They are similar in design to conventional roof tiles but with a photovoltaic cell within in order to generate renewable electricity. A collaboration between the companies SolarCity and Tesla produced a hydrographically printed tile which appears to be a regular tile from street level but is transparent to sunlight when viewed straight on.

His name means 'mercy of Jesus'. Hnanishoʿ offended the caliph ʿAbd al-Malik with a tactless remark about Islam, which gave his enemies the opportunity to dethrone him in 691. He spent the next two years of his reign either in prison or, after surviving a murder attempt, in hiding, while the throne of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was occupied by the anti-patriarch Yohannan Garba ('the Leper'). He was restored in 693, after Yohannan's disgrace and death. After his death he was rehabilitated by his successor Sliba-zkha.  Sources  Brief accounts of Hnanishoʿ's patriarchate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), ʿAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). A modern assessment of Hnanishoʿ's reign can be found in David Wilmshurst's The Martyred Church.Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 106–8  Hnanishoʿ's patriarchate  The following account of Hnanishoʿ's patriarchate is given by Bar Hebraeus: > Hnanishoʿ, who succeeded Yohannan Bar Marta in the dignity of catholicus, > was consecrated at Seleucia in the year 67 of the Arabs [AD 686/7]. The > metropolitan Yohannan of Nisibis, known as Garba ['the Leper'], was offended > with him for the following reason. When ʿAbd al-Malik, son of Marwan, the > king of the Arabs arrived in the land of Senʿar [Babylonia], Hnanishoʿ came > to meet him and offered him the usual presents. The king said, 'Tell me, > catholicus, what do you think of the religion of the Arabs?' The catholicus, > who was always prone to give hasty answers, replied, 'It is a kingdom > founded by the sword; and not, like the Christian faith and the old faith of > Moses, a faith that is confirmed by divine miracles.' The king was angry, > and ordered his tongue to be cut out, but several people interceded for him, > and he was allowed to go free. All the same, the king commanded that he > should not again be admitted into his presence. This incident gave Yohannan > Garba an opportunity of realising his ambition. He bribed some officials to > forge him a letter from the king to Bshir bar Malka, the governor of ʿAqula. > Yohannan went to him, offering him gifts and handing him the king's letter. > Bshir then summoned Hnanishoʿ, stripped him, and handed his patriarchal robe > and staff of office to Yohannan. He then sent Yohannan to Seleucia, where > the bishops were forced to consecrate him. Yohannan kept Hnanishoʿ locked up > in a prison for a while, then packed him off with two of his disciples to > one of the mountain monasteries. They made him climb up to the top of the > mountain, and then threw him down. They thought he was dead, but some > shepherds found him, saw that he was still breathing, took him back to their > hut and looked after him. Eventually he left them and took shelter in the > monastery of Yonan in the region of Mosul. Meanwhile Yohannan had borrowed > large sums of gold in order to bribe the governor of ʿAqula, and when the > time came for repayment was unable to meet his obligations. He was thrown > into prison, and died there. Then Hnanishoʿ resumed his rule, and died after > fulfilling his office for fourteen years.Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical > Chronicle (ed. Abeloos and Lamy), ii. 136–40 Bar Hebraeus also mentioned that Hnanishoʿ was rehabilitated after his death by his successor Sliba-zkha: > He removed the name of Yohannan Garba from the diptychs, reconsecrated the > bishops consecrated by Garba, and put back the name of Hnanishoʿ, who had > been oppressed by calumny, alongside those of the rest of the catholici.Bar > Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed. Abeloos and Lamy), ii. 150  Literary achievement  Hnanishoʿ was a noted author. Besides composing homilies, sermons and epistles, he was the author of a life of his contemporary Sargis Dauda of Dauqarah near Kashkar. He also wrote a treatise On the Twofold Use of the School, in which he argued that schools and universities should be places of moral and religious training as well as of instruction in letters, and a commentary on the Analytics of Aristotle.Wright, A Short History of Syriac Literature, 181–2; Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 132 His letters are an essential source for understanding the functioning of justice in the East Syrian world at the end of the 7th century. Hnanishoʿ provides some insight into early Christian attitudes towards Islam. Commenting on , he obliquely refers to Islam as \\"some new folly\\" that claims Jesus was only a prophet. Bar Hebraeus, writing the 13th century, recorded the tradition that Hnanishoʿ, when asked \\"what do you think of the religion of the Arabs?\\" responded, \\"It is a religion established by the sword and not a faith confirmed by miracles, as the Christian faith and the old Law of Moses.\\"  Posthumous miracles  In 1349 Hnanishoʿ's remains were exhumed by the Nestorians of Mosul. The patriarch had been buried in the monastery of Jonah, on the east bank of the Tigris opposite Mosul, and when the tomb was opened his body, lying in a coffin of planewood, was found to be in a miraculous state of preservation. The historian ʿAmr, who saw the body for himself, said that crowds came to view the dead patriarch, who seemed to be only sleeping. The monastery was confiscated and turned into a place of Muslim pilgrimage shortly afterwards, and when Timur Leng visited it in 1393 it had undergone a remarkable transformation. Hnanishoʿ was no longer remembered and Timur was shown the tomb of the prophet Jonah himself. The 'tomb of Jonah' still exists, and visitors are still shown a heavy planewood coffin, reverently shrouded with a green cloth, in which the prophet supposedly lies buried. Some historians suspect that for the past six centuries the Muslim faithful have been paying their devotions to the petrified corpse of a Christian patriarch.Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 284 See also * List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East NotesReferences * Abbeloos, J.

DOD month and children listed by Sir William Dugdale after his visitation. Biography Notwithstanding the near connection which subsisted between Sir Edward Rodes and the Earl of Strafford (his sister Elizabeth was Strafford's third wife and widow), there was a wide difference in the political and religious views of each. Few entered more eagerly into the objects contemplated by the Long Parliament, when affairs were advancing to a crisis; and it was for the most part to Sir Edward Rodes, and his two friends the Hothams,\\"young Hotham, his cousin [?]\\" (Barnard p. 315) that the scheme, for maintaining the peace of Yorkshire (the Treaty of Neutrality), arranged by the two great parties at Rothwell on 29 September, before the war began, was frustrated. Sir Edward's zeal that may have been quickened by personal injury—One of the stipulations at the treaty was that reparation should be made to \\"Sir Edward Rodes for the injury done him\\"—for at the beginning of September 1643, an attack was made on his house at Great Houghton, by a party of royalists under the command of Captain Grey, when, according to the diurnals of the time, all the outhouses were burnt, his goods plundered to the amount of £600, his lady uncivilly treated, some of his servants wounded, and one slain.Burke (1838), pp. 563,564. A footnote entry quotes: Hunter's History of Doncaster Later during the First Civil War Rodes was taken into custody by Parliament, and with the Hothams committed to the Tower of London, but as nothing could be proved against him he was liberated,Fox, p. 243 (Sir John Hotham and his son, John Hotham the younger, were beheaded for treason after they were found guilty of conspiring to hand Hull over the Royalists). During the Second Civil War, Royalists gained control of Pontefract Castle and started to plunder and capture prominent local Parliamentarians. To counter the threat, the Parliamentary committee of the militia of Yorkshire appointed Sir Edward with Sir Henry Cholmley to levy troops and advance on Pontefract Castle. They were ordered to invest the castle, but if their forces were insufficiently strong to besiege of the castle, then they to endeavour to keep in the garrison in the castle and to protect and preserve the surrounding countryside. It seems that Cholmley took overall command while Rodes commanded the cavalry,Fox p. 234,248 as Sir Rodes was ordered by Oliver Cromwell to pursue the Duke of Hamilton, the commander of the combined English Royalist and Scottish Covenanter armies after his defeat by Cromwell and the New Model Army at the Battle of Preston. At the end of August on his return from Scotland Cromwell took overall command for the sieges of Scarborough and Pontefract (at which point Rodes came under his direct command again). Cromwell reinforced the besiegers at Pontefract so that the Parliamentarians now had five thousand men and Sir Edward's squadrons besieging the castle. That the siege of Pontefract Castle was ineffective was highlighted when on 31 October Colonel Thomas Rainsborough was killed at Doncaster, by a party of Cavaliers who sallied out of Pontefract, to capture him, but when he shouted for his guard and attempted to defend himself with a pistol, they cut him down and returned to the castle. Rainsborough was on his way to take command of the siege which was proving to be a difficult fortress to subdue as it was \\"[...] one of the strongest inland garrisons in the kingdom\\".Staff. History and Records of the Duchy of Lancaster: Pontefract Castle, West Yorkshire , Duchy of Lancaster Fox pp.234,251 Cromwell took direct command of the siege and fully invested the castle with lines of circumvallation. Cromwell had to leave on other business and so General Lambert took command on 4 December. The Royalist garrison finally surrendered on 24 March 1649.Fox, pp. 251–261 During the Interregnum Rodes served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1650, and was commissioned as a colonel of horse under Cromwell in 1654; he was also a member of Cromwell's privy council. It would seem that Rodes was much in Scotland during the protectorate,Rhodes may have had family connections there (Burke p.564) for he was sheriff of Perthshire, and represented Perth in the parliaments of 1656–8 and 1659–1660 and at the same time that his son was returned for Liolithgow, Stirling, and Clackmannan. After the restoration he was allowed to live quietly at Great Houghton, which became an asylum to the ejected ministers, who refused to comply with the Act of Uniformity 1662. Rodes was still living at Great Houghton when Sir William Dugdale's visited, but died soon after. Family Edward Rode's grandfather was Francis Rodes, of Stavely Woodthorpe, one of the justices of the Common Pleas in the time of Elizabeth. This gentleman built Barlborough Hall in 1583, but died at his residence at Stavely Woodthorpe a few years after its completion. He married first Elizabeth, daughter of Brian Sandford, esq. of Thorp Salvine, in Yorkshire, and had, with her daughters and two sons: :1) John, his heir, b. 1562. :2) Peter, of Hickleton. Francis Rodes married secondly, Mary, daughter of Francis Charlton, esq. of Appley, in Shropshire, with whom he had, with other issue, a son, Godfrey (Sir), of Great Houghton, knighted at Havering, 13 July 1615, who married four wives, and left, with other issue, including a daughter, Elizabeth, the third wife and widow of the ill-fated Thomas Wentworth Earl of Strafford, and a son and successor, Sir Edward Rodes of Great Houghton. Edward Rodes married Mary (or Margaret), the daughter of Sir Hammond Whichcote and Millicent Markham in 1629. They had a number of children, but only one son, William married and had children. William had two sons Godfrey (d. unmarried 1709) and William Rodes, esq. of Great Houghton, the last male heir of this branch of the family, who died unmarried in 1740, leaving his two sisters, his co-heirs. Cultural influence Edward Rodes's house is mentioned in Sir Walter Scott's \\"Old Ballads\\". It is either about a house in Scotland that the family owned or about the 1642 Cavalier attack on the house in Great Houghton.Barnard, p. 315Burke, p. 564Arthur Quiller-Couch, ed. 1919.

He was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. Early life and career Murphy was born in 1834 in County Tipperary, Ireland. In 1852, he emigrated to the United States along with his brother Michael. Soon after his arrival, he entered the Brooklyn, New York firm of Patrick C. Keely as an apprentice. Keely was already an established architect specializing in ecclesiastical design. Eventually, Murphy became a partner in the firm, operating as Keely & Murphy. Murphy would later marry Keely's sister-in-law. Architectural practice By the mid-1860s, the duo opened a branch office in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1875, the partnership was dissolved and Murphy established his own practice.St. Patrick's (accessed 17 January 2011) Murphy continued to specialize in church design for the ever-growing number of Roman Catholic parishes during the late nineteenth century, particularly in the southern New England area of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. In the 1880s and 1890s, Murphy employed his nephew, Ambrose J. Murphy, who would later partner with Frank R. Hindle. Some time around 1900, Murphy established a new office in Boston, Massachusetts. Personal life James Murphy married Patrick Charles Keely's sister-in-law. Murphy had a brother, Michael Murphy, with whom he emigrated to America. The architect, Ambrose J. Murphy, was his nephew. Murphy died April 18, 1907 at the Holy Ghost Hospital (Cambridge, Massachusetts) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.RIHS, Murphy, Hindle and Wright Architects Records (Accessed 17 January 2011) Legacy Ambrose J. Murphy continued James Murphy's firm after 1907. He entered into partnership with Frank R. Hindle to form the firm of Murphy & Hindle, which practiced architecture in Rhode Island until the 1940s.

Note: this includes four chapters on sites within the Quehanna Wild Area, Marion Brooks Natural Area (3), Beaver Run Dam Wildlife Viewing Area (4), Hoover Farm Wildlife Viewing Area (5), and Wykoff Run Natural Area (6). Marion Brooks Natural Area, known for its large stand of White Birch, was formerly known as Paige Run Natural Area; in 1975 it was renamed for Marion E. Brooks, a pioneering environmentalist from Elk County. White birch Paper birch, or Betula alba var. papyrifera, is a large tree usually reaching a height of , with a diameter of , but it may reach a height of with a diameter of .Joseph Illick, ‘’Pennsylvania trees. “White Birch”. Pennsylvania Department of Forests. Harrisburg: Wm Stanley Ray, 1914, p. 114. Generally the tree is shade-intolerant,Charles Fergus, Trees of Pennsylvania and the Northeast, Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, , 2002, p. 92. and, when grown in the open, trunks are usually short and thick; lateral, often ascending branches cover the trunk from the base. When grown in close stands, most of the trunk is branch-less base and bears a narrow open head. The bark of the trunk and older branches is chalky to creamy white, and peels in layers that are tinged in yellow and covered with horizontally-elongated lenticels. On older trunks, the bark is often rough and fissured with irregular thick scales. The twigs are stout, viscid, with first greenish hairy covering that later becomes smooth and reddish brown in color. After several years, branches turn a bright white, like the trunk, and are covered with pale, horizontally-elongated and orange-colored lenticels.Illick, p. 114. Birch buds may be ovate, sharp- pointed, and divergent, about long, dark, almost chestnut brown in color, and covered with a few overlapping bud scales. These usually have downy margins. The leaves alternate, with simple ovate, long, and wide. They are firm in texture, the upper surface being dark green and the under surface light green. They are narrowed or rounded at the base, sharply toothed on the margin, and have a sharp-pointed apex. Flowers appear in late April or May, before the leaves. The staminate are arranged in layers which occur in groups of 2-3 and are about long. They become longer, , in the spring. The pistillate have light green lanceolate scales and red styles, and appear in clusters long. The fruit is cylindrical, with a short-stalked strophile about long. The scales are long, with thick, lateral lobes, and a long terminal lobe. Seeds and small and winged, and the wings are wider than the nut. The wood, a hardwood, is diffuse, porous, rays are small and inconspicuous. The wood itself is light in color, usually light brown, tinged with red, and with thick light sap wood, and its weight is per cubic foot. It is strong wood, once used extensively in the manufacture of spools, shoe lasts, pegs, fuel, and in the manufacture of paper pulp,Illick,p. 114 but also in by Native Americans in the construction of horns, canoes, snowshoe frames, and as coverings for the Long houses characteristic of the Iroquois and associated nations. In canoes, the bark that touched the wood was the side that touched the river, and the resulting canoe could be very strong, useful in rapids or in ocean travel. Native Americans also boiled the sap of paper birch to make a syrup.Fergus, p. 92 The Paper birch is also known as canoe birch and white birch, but should not be confused with the European white birch, another deciduous tree that grows in thickets along roadsides, pastures and waste ground.Ann Fowler Rhoads. The vascular flora of Pennsylvania. Philadelphia:American Philosophical Society, 1993. , p. 76. Range Although its range extends from Newfoundland to Alaska, and as far south as Michigan, Colorado and Washington, it is only found in the northern part of Pennsylvania, and in scattered instances in Tioga and adjoining counties.

He attended Dartmouth College from 1957–59, and the University of California, Berkeley from 1959-62 where he earned his BA. Career Beasley ranks among the most productive sculptors of the post- Henry Moore/David Smith generation of abstract sculptors. Today, Beasley is recognised as one of the most noteworthy and innovative sculptors on the American West Coast. His work can be found in the permanent collection of 40 art museums around the world, including: Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the Guggenheim Museum, New York City; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the National Art Museum of China in Beijing; the Musee National d'Art Moderne-Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris; the Smithsonian Museum of American Art in Washington, DC; the Kunsthalle Mannheim in Germany; and the Islamic Museum in Cairo. 1960s In the 1960s, Beasley's first work consisted of welded sculptures made from broken cast iron. This work brought him national recognition when in 1961 one of his sculptures was included in the ground breaking exhibition The Art of Assemblage at the New York, Museum of Modern Art a piece which appeared in an exhibition which Philip Linhares, Chief Curator of Art of the Oakland Museum of California referred to as \\"seminal\\". The following year his assemblage sculpture \\"Chorus\\" was acquired by New York's Museum of Modern Art,Los Angeles Times (December 16, 1962) making Beasley the youngest artist to have work in the permanent collection. In 1961, while a student at Berkeley, Beasley joined Peter Voulkos in building one of the first sculptor-built foundries, the storied Garbanzo Works that was instrumental in the Renaissance of bronze casting in American sculpture. Following an abstract esthetic, he began casting sculptures in bronze and aluminum. In 1963, he was one of eleven artists to represent the United States at the Biennale de Paris, where French Minister of Culture Andre Malraux awarded him the purchase prize.San Francisco Chronicle, 4 February 1964; San Francisco Examiner, 3 February 1964 In 1968, Beasley began investigating the use of transparency as a sculptural medium.\\"The Crystal Clear Scene\\", Time (9 February 1968) He was successful in creating small transparent sculptures in cast acrylic but experts at Dupont and Rohm & Hass were convinced that it was impossible to do castings as large as Beasley envisioned. That year, the State of California invited Beasley to participate in a competition for a monumental sculpture for the state. At first, the jury was unaware that Beasley was experimenting with transparency as a sculptural medium and invited him based on his work in cast metal. Beasley was determined to pursue transparency and proposed a monumental cast acrylic sculpture. Upon seeing Beasley's proposal, they questioned the sculptor about its viability. He convinced them that creating what he envisioned was no problem but privately knew that he would have to invent a new process, which he did.American Association for the Advancement of Science, \\"The Sculpture Transparent\\", Science (December 1983) His proposal for Apolymon, a transparent sculpture in cast acrylic won and he installed the piece in Sacramento in 1970.\\"Sculptor Unveils Impossible Feat\\", Los Angeles Times (15 March 1970); \\"The Age of Acrylic Dawns in Sacramento\\", Artnews (May 1970) 1970s Fascinated by the esthetics of transparency, Beasley worked in cast acrylic for the next ten years. In 1974, members of the undersea research community approached Beasley to see if he could adapt his technique to cast transparent bathyspheres for undersea exploration. He succeeded in creating the bathyspheres for Johnson Sea Link submersibles for Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute.\\"The Undersea World of Bruce Beasley's Bathysphere\\", San Francisco Chronicle (1 February 1976) It was these submersibles that were deployed to locate the crew compartment on the bottom of the ocean after the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated upon liftoff in 1986. Beasley continued to make transparent sculpture for the next ten years. His transparent sculptures were exhibited widely both in the US and abroad including solo exhibitions in 1972 at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the San Diego Museum of Art, and group shows including the Salon de Mai in Paris and at Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan. 1980s In 1980, Beasley turned back to metal, exploring a more formal geometry with a series of large sculptures produced in both stainless steel and aluminum. He created a number of monumental commissions for public institutions including the San Francisco International Airport, Stanford University; the State of California; the State of Alaska; the Miami International Airport; the City of Eugene, Oregon; and Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton, New Jersey. In 1987, he turned to a new direction of work involving cube-like intersecting polyhedra. While most of these were made in cast or fabricated bronze, he also created them in carved granite. This work has been exhibited worldwide in more than 100 exhibitions in Europe and Asia.\\"Works of California Sculptor in the Mannheim Kunsthalle\\", Allegemeine Zeitung (13 July 1994) Public commissions for this series have included the cities of Oakland, California; Dortmund, Germany; Mannheim, Germany; Bad Homburg, Germany; Monterrey, Mexico; Palo Alto, California; as well as the University of Oregon and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In 2008, Beasley began sculpting a new series of intersecting stainless steel disks. One of this series, commissioned by the Chinese government for the Beijing Summer Olympics\\"Bruce Beasley to Create Work for Olympics\\", San Francisco Chronicle (5 August 2008) is 15 feet tall and remains permanently installed as part of the Beijing Olympic Park. The Expo 2010 in Shanghai also commissioned a large sculpture in this series for permanent installation in Shanghai.

Sources  Brief accounts of Enosh's patriarchate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), ʿAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). An important incident during Enosh's reign is also mentioned in the Chronicle of Seert, an ecclesiastical history probably written towards the end of the ninth century. Modern assessments of Enosh's reign can be found in Jean-Maurice Fiey's Chrétiens syriaques sous les Abbassides and David Wilmshurst's The Martyred Church.Fiey, Chrétiens syriaques sous les Abbassides, 112–14; Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 150–1  Enosh's election  The following account of Enosh's controversial election is given by Bar Hebraeus: > At about the same time, in the third year of the caliph al-Muʿtamid, the > Nestorian catholicus Sargis died, after fulfilling his office for twelve > years. After their church remained widowed for four years, he was succeeded > by Enosh, the metropolitan of Mosul. A great dissension arose among the > people, with some calling for Enosh and others for Israel, bishop of > Kashkar. When two men met, one would ask, 'Are you for Enosh or for Israel?' > If the other man gave the wrong answer, the questioner punched him and > kicked him as hard as he could. The scribes and the doctors of the caliph > took the part of Enosh, and removed Israel. Enosh was thereupon consecrated > at Seleucia after the feast of Epiphany in the year 263 of the Arabs [AD > 876].Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed. Abeloos and Lamy), ii. > 206–8 A slightly more substantial account of Enosh's election is given by Mari: > Enosh was appointed metropolitan of Mosul by Sargis. After his death the > bishop Israel of Kashkar arrived and summoned the fathers to the customary > synod. Many of the faithful decided to vote for him and elect him patriarch, > thinking that as a learned and honest man, who was widely admired by the > Christians, he deserved that dignity. But Enosh, metropolitan of Mosul, a > learned and bold man, came forward to claim the patriarchate for himself, > and many of the faithful decided to vote for him. A party was formed to > support him, the people were divided into two camps, and discords and evils > arose. The people boldly inveighed against the nobles, and each candidate > asked the friends of the sultan to support his own bid. Meanwhile, the > public peace was also disturbed by al-ʿAlawi of Basra. Then the governor of > Baghdad sent a man to bring Israel from Samarra to Baghdad, and told him not > to say a word about the patriarchate if the Christians asked him about it. > When Israel was descending from the bema during the singing of the responses > of the liturgy, one of the supporters of Enosh lost all fear of God, and in > the press of the large crowd seized and crushed his testicles. He was > carried away in a faint, and after lying ill for forty days he eventually > died, and was buried in the chapel of the martyrs in the old church of the > monastery of Mar Pethion.Mari, 81 (Arabic); 72 (Latin)  Enosh's patriarchate  Bar Hebraeus gave only the briefest of notices of Enosh's seven-year reign: > The catholicus Enosh, having fulfilled his office, died at the beginning of > hziran [June] in the year 270 of the Arabs [AD 884].Bar Hebraeus, > Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed. Abeloos and Lamy), ii. 210 Mari has little more to say about Enosh's reign, and mentions only that he adjudicated a dispute between the Nestorians of Hirta (al-Hira) and Kashkar: > When the people of al-Hira and the people of Kashkar began to argue in the > church of Asbagh in the Greek Palace over their prerogatives, Enosh > considered the claims of both sides, arbitrated between them, gave a written > decision which was accepted as having official force, and threatened > transgressors with anathematisation. His decision was confirmed by several > later synods, the last of which was held in the time of Ibn ʿAli al- > Khazin.Mari, 81 (Arabic); 72 (Latin) The most notable event of Enosh's reign was the 'discovery' in 878 at Birmantha, by a Nestorian monk named Habib, of a treaty nearly two hundred and fifty years old, written in Arabic on a yellowing oxhide, between the prophet Muhammad and the Christians of Najran. This treaty, which bore Muhammad's seal, promised the Christians freedom of worship, exemption from military service, and privileges for monks and women.Chronicle of Seert, ii. 281–7 Some modern scholars believe that this 'treaty' was forged by the Nestorians in an attempt to secure better treatment for Christians living under Muslim rule.Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 150–1 See also * List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East NotesReferences * Abbeloos, J.

The court martial on 20 February 1806 found that it was pilot Robert Barron's inexperience that caused the wreck; he was severely reprimanded and lost all pay. However, the court saved its greatest criticism for Luckraft. It deemed his actions before and after the wreck to be so incompetent that it constituted criminal negligence. He was so drunk at the time of the wreck that his orders were incoherent. The court ordered him dismissed the service and to be imprisoned in the Marshalsea or two months.

Established in 1956, the school catered for approximately 1,100 students, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom five percent identified as Indigenous Australians and ten percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; the principal is Melinda Brady.  Overview  The school motto is \\"Together We Achieve\\". The school lays an emphasis on traditional subjects, while offering several vocational education courses. It has strong ties with the local community and emphasises involvement, caring and responsibility. It has a particularly strong co-curriculum that features the creative and performing arts, adventure programs and sports. Its mission statement emphasises its purpose to enable students to reach their full potential through encouraging achievement, positive values and the desire to learn.  Sporting exchange program  Camden High School has one of the longest running sporting exchanges in Australia. Many thousands of young people have benefited from this wonderful sporting event, and lifelong friendships have been forged between city and country. In the early 1970s Paul Montgomery, an English teacher at Camden High School had the idea that a sporting competition with another school over a three-day period would be a wonderful way of forging valuable links between students from different backgrounds. With the Principal, Phillip Patterson, it was decided that the school should be a rural school of comparable size and approximately a four-hour distance from Camden. This would make the travelling time manageable while still providing enough distance to make the enterprise adventurous for the students. Letters were sent to a number of schools and Cowra High School was eventually chosen as the perfect school with which to establish the competition. In 1972, the first exchange occurred with Cowra students travelling to Camden for the inaugural games. It was decided at this stage to name the competition in honour of the late Robert Montgomery who had been the Deputy Principal at Camden High from 1969-1970. Many years later, the games continue to provide many students with wonderful sporting, cultural and social experiences. This is the result of the continued commitment of all staff at both schools and particularly the team coaches and the chief organisers. In recent years, Anna-Lisa Reeves from Camden High and Steve Johnstone from Cowra High have spent a great deal of time and effort ensuring these games continue to flourish. Camden High School also has an outstanding Trade Training Centre which it shares with students from Elderslie High School and Elizabeth Macarthur High School. Location The school was originally situated on John and Exeter Streets within the town of Camden itself. This site was previously a gasworks and after industrial contamination was discovered at the school in 1995, including BTEX, PAH, cyanides and sulphates, it was closed down. The property was completely fenced off pending remediation. An unknown number of former students who attended the original site became ill. Marsdens solicitors in Camden commenced preparation of a class action against the Department of Education. On 23 July 2013 the ABC TV 7.30 Report aired details of an investigate report into the matter. Construction of the new high school was completed in 2001, with students and staff making use of the new facilities from the end of that year. The new school is set on with views of the Razorback Range as a backdrop.

The Historic Church of St. Peter also has a partner parish in Grindstone, Pennsylvania named St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church, which was built in 1931. Description The first Catholic parish in Fayette County, it is the oldest continuously operating parish in Western Pennsylvania. It is also believed to have been the spot on which the first religious service of any kind offered west of the Allegheny Mountains was held. On July 1, 1754, French troops on their way to capture Fort Necessity from the British climbed the bank from the Monongahela River with their Chaplain Rev. Denys Baron and prayed for victory. That mass of the French troops is depicted in one of the stained glass windows in the church. The stone Gothic Revival church building on Church Street is a landmark. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is located in the Brownsville Northside Historic District. At the time when the church was built, many European settlers where moving their way into the area. The Catholic Irish settlers decided to build a church the same as other religious groups in the area. To show wealth and power, they decided to build a church overlooking the town that could be seen from almost any perspective. To tie in the local history of the area, they built the church of rough river rock and depicted the French and Indian War in the stained glass window at the anterior of the church. The stained glass windows, which feature 32 different shades of blue depict Catholic history from 1754 to 1843. The church was established in 1843 to serve the burgeoning Irish American population. At the time, Brownsville was an important gateway to the West and South due to its location on the National Road, and believing it, not Pittsburgh, would become the seat of the episcopal see, the founders built the church to be a future cathedral. The pulpit is located to the left of the altar, as in a cathedral, and the crypt includes space for the tombs of bishops. Cemetery Another unique feature of The Historic Church of St. Peter is its cemetery. In addition to its unique inscriptions on the headstone, the Cemetery has been featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not as the only cemetery with heated graves. The boiler that heated the church was located in a separate building across the street and the pipes running under the cemetery to the church created a significant enough amount of heat to even melt snow on several grave sites.

The company provides Australian States and Territories resource sharing capabilities. The NAFC Board of Directors is made up of senior fire chiefs from around the country. Role NAFC was developed in 2003 by representatives of the Australian Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments to provide a cooperative approach to manage aerial firefighting. The authorities recognised a need for a national approach to the determining and contracting of certain capabilities following extreme bushfires which affected Australia on a national level.http://www.nafc.org.au NAFC facilitates the coordination and procurement of a fleet of firefighting aircraft funded by both the Australian Government and State and Territory Governments and are utilised by State and Territory fire agencies nationally. Firefighting agencies have benefited from the availability of extra aircraft that can be easily moved from State to State, with the national arrangements allowing resources to be redeployed to areas experiencing high fire risk.  Aerial Fleet  A wide range of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft are used to support Australian fire operations. Aircraft are selected for individual tasks based on their suitability for the task and their cost effectiveness. There are currently 45 individual aircraft contracted through NAFC for the States and Territories. Keep in mind that there are also some other aircraft contracted directly to States and Territories. Aircrane, Photo by Etan Tal Larger helicopters such as the Elvis (helicopter) and the Sikorsky S61N are most often used for firebombing and crew transportations, whilst smaller helicopters are more often used for command and control, mapping and aerial ignition. Fixed-wing aircraft that are used for firebombing tend to be of the larger agricultural-style, specially modified for firebombing. These aircraft are sometimes referred to as SEATs (Single-Engined Air Tankers). This type of aircraft particularly suits the conditions most often encountered in Australia where there are relatively few long paved runways, but plenty of agricultural airstrips. Larger fixed-wing aircraft have been used where appropriate and cost-effective. Light fixed-wing aircraft are also regularly used for fire detection, reconnaissance, command and control. Aircraft Tracking NAFC and its Members (Australian States and Territories) have decided to adopt a national standard approach to the provision of tracking and event logging services for aircraft involved in firefighting and related operations. It is planned that this will extend to messaging systems in the future. The adoption of a national approach follows extensive investigation and consultation with agencies and operators throughout Australia. A number of operational trials have also been undertaken.

The incident was the only hostile encounter between United States and German military forces during the Pacific Ocean campaign of the war. Background SMS Cormoran was originally a passenger and cargo ship, named SS Ryaezan and built by the Germans in 1909 for the Russian merchant fleet. When the war broke out, she was captured off Korea by SMS Emden and transformed into an auxiliary cruiser. Cormoran was armed with eight 10.5 cm (4.1 in) rapid fire guns from the original SMS Cormoran and commanded by Captain Adalbert Zuckschwerdt. The number of crew she had on board is unknown. Setting out from Tsingtao on August 10, 1914 for a commerce raiding cruise in the South Pacific, SMS Cormoran failed to sink any enemy shipping as she spent all of her time avoiding allied warships. Captain Zuckschwerdt pulled into Apra Harbor, Guam on December 14 with the intention of receiving coal from the Americans on the island. The United States was a neutral power at this time so the Germans were refused the proper amount of coal needed to continue their voyage, there was little coal on the island for the Americans and Guamanians themselves. So the German sailors were interned and for about two years they lived among the Americans and Guamanians in friendship until the American entry into World War I. Scuttling When war was declared on April 7, 1917, the United States Marines and sailors on Guam were notified and set out from their base. They embarked the old screw schooner USS Supply with the goal of capturing the auxiliary cruiser, or destroying it. Not wanting to anger the Germans they had lived with for two years and not wanting to expose the Guamanians to needless harm; the Americans resorted to first requesting that the Germans surrender peacefully. In case anything went wrong, the artillery battery of three 7 inch guns on the western face of Mount Tenjo was also trained on the vessel. Before Captain Zuckschwerdt could refuse surrender a group of United States Navy sailors on the deck of USS Supply noticed that the Germans were preparing to scuttle their vessel instead of surrendering or attempting an escape. An aerial view of Apra Harbor. The sailors notified the Marines so one of the Americans fired a shot across the German ship's bow with his rifle. The shot was the first to be fired by the United States at the Germans after war had been declared. A similar incident occurred in 1915 at Fort San Felipe del Morro in the Caribbean, America's very first shot was fired, at a different German auxiliary cruiser which was also interned in a neutral American port. Despite the warning shot, which alarmed the Germans, the scuttling continued but at a faster pace. The Germans finished setting their explosives and they began to evacuate. The Cormoran exploded and sank to the bottom of the harbor where she remains today. USS Supply quickly became a hospital ship when she came to the aid of the German lifeboats. Accounts of the event differ but what is known is that nine Germans were killed while scuttling the Cormoran, either by the explosion which crippled the ship or by the American marines who did not want the Cormoran sunk. The rest of the German crew were captured by the Americans and the dead were buried on Guam with full military honors. The prisoners were sent to various American forts until finally being released after World War I in 1919. SMS Cormoran rests 110 feet (34 m) below the water of Apra harbor on her port side. A Japanese cargo ship, the Tokai Maru, which was sunk during World War II leans up against her screw. Together the ships are one of the few places where a diver can visit a sunken vessel of World War I next to a sunken vessel of World War II. The shipwreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 due to its association with the First World War.

They play hardcore punk- influenced extreme metal. A key factor of their sound is the \\"Boss HM-2 Heavy Metal Pedal\\", which was popularized by bands such as Entombed, Dismember and Edge of Sanity in the early 1990s.  History  Black Breath began in 2005, playing local bars and house shows in Bellingham. They released a few demos, and toured the underground before finally recording an actual EP in 2008. In 2008 they released the Razor to Oblivion EP under their own label, Hot Mass Records. The EP gained attention in the local music underground and the band signed with Southern Lord Records, a Los Angeles based metal and hardcore punk oriented label, in October 2009. Black Breath toured across the country to support the EP as a support act for Victims, Rise and Fall, and Trap Them. Southern Lord then took over the distribution of the EP, which was re-released under the new label, and Black Breath went to the east coast to record their debut album, Heavy Breathing, at GodCity Studios, owned by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou. Heavy Breathing was released on March 30, 2010 by Southern Lord. Their second album titled Sentenced To Life was released March 27, 2012 also on Southern Lord Records. In October 2014 it was announced that Black Breath would be returning to GodCity Studios to record their follow up, Slaves Beyond Death, for an early 2015 release.

She was known for a record passage from New York to Bombay, and for a race around the Horn with three other clippers. Record set, New York to Bombay Sweepstakes made a record passage from New York to Bombay in 1857, of 74 days, between May 9 and July 22. At the time, it was \\"one of the fastest passages on record between the two ports.\\" California clipper Sweepstakes was built at the height of the clipper ship boom, in 1853, when there was a high demand for quick transportation to the California Gold Rush. Forty-eight clipper ships were built that year. Sweepstakes was the last clipper ship built by the Westervelt shipyard. Just the year before, in autumn of 1852, \\"four splendid new clipper ships put to sea from New York, bound for California\\" in \\"the most celebrated and famous ship-race that has ever been run\\": Wild Pigeon, John Gilpin, Flying Fish and Trade Wind. \\"All ran against time; but the John Gilpin and the Flying Fish for the whole course, and the Wild Pigeon for part of it, ran neck and neck, the one against the other, and each against all. It was a sweepstake with these ships around Cape Horn and through both hemispheres.\\" Sweepstakes, though black-hulled like other clippers, bore a stripe of gold, found on only a few others like the N.B. Palmer, and was praised for her sleek lines and speed. The clipper bow of Sweepstakes was an unusual form, with an upright, curved stem, a straight keel, and a rockered, arched forefoot. A rather dramatic mishap occurred during the launch. The ship was sliding down the ways towards the water, when the rails gave way and spread out. The ship careened onto its side, and remained toppled over for three days, until Tuesday the 21st. The ship \\"struck the staging alongside and around the stern\\" of another clipper ship under construction, Kathay. A \\"large number\\" of spectators viewing the launch from Kathay were pitched into the water, but all were recovered without incident. With the help of steam tugs and two floating derricks, Sweepstakes was brought to Brooklyn Navy Yard for inspection and repairs. Afterwards, the owners proposed a sweepstakes race for the new ship. \\"Messrs. Chambers & Heiser offer[ed] to sail the Sweepstakes, a clipper ship of 1600 tons, partially launched on June 18 from the ship-yard of Messrs. Westervelt & Sons, in this city, a race of 3000 miles, say 1500 out and return, each ship to pay an entrance of $10,000; the race to be subject to such rules and regulations as shall be prescribed by the New York Yacht Club. Sailing card Of the California clippers which sailed between 1850-1860, Sweepstakes was one of eighteen ships which made passages between New York and San Francisco in less than 100 days. The fastest trip between New York and San Francisco was 89 days; Sweepstakes came in seventh, with a passage of 94 days. Sweepstakes' ports of call included New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Manila, Macao, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Bombay. In the preface to his autobiography, Master of the Show, Augustus Pitou, a Broadway producer who spent fifty years in theater as a manager, playwright, and actor, claimed to have sailed to Australia aboard Sweepstakes as a cabin boy. Final voyage Sweepstakes made its final voyage in 1862, from Adelaide to Batavia. The ship went aground on a reef in the Sunda Strait during this passage, and was damaged. It was drydocked for inspection, and condemned. The ship was sold for scrap on May 13, 1862, for 15,000 florins.

Most of the school's students come from the Saint-Maurice region of Quebec; many of them from the conservatoire preparatory programs at the school of St-Gabriel du Cap-de-la- Madeleine and the comprehensive school Ste-Ursule de Trois-Rivières. The CMQT was originally located on Laviolette St, but in 1970 the school moved to better facilities in the building of the Centre culturel and the former École Ste-Marie. The conservatoire moved to its present location on Radisson Street in October 1978. Founded by pianist Czeslaw Kaczynski in 1964, the CMQT became an entirely state-subsidized institution by the Quebec government in 1967. The conservatoire is part of a network of 9 conservatories in Quebec, the Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Québec (CMADQ), and was the third school in the CMADQ network to be established. Kaczynski served as the school's first director until 1970. The current director is Louis Dallaire.Conservatoire de musique du Québec at Encyclopedia of Music in Canada History The CMQT was originally a pre-college preparatory school which was established by Kaczynski in 1964, opening for its first day of classes on 1 April 1964. Exactly three years later to the day, the school became a full- fledged conservatory with a college program and became a member school of the CMADQ. Kaczynski continued to lead the school through 1970, leading a staff whose members included Gaston Arel (music theory), Otto Armin (violin), Hervé Baillargeon (flute), Raymond Daveluy (harmony/counterpoint), Réal Gagnier (oboe), Stephen Kondaks (viola), Rafael Masella (clarinet), Élisabeth Miquel (piano and piano accompaniment), Bernard Piché (organ and theoretical subjects), Antoine Reboulot (piano) and Charles Reiner (piano and piano accompaniment). Originally the CMQT only offered instruction in instrumental music, with Jean Deslauriers serving as the school's first orchestra director. Raymond Daveluy succeeded Kaczynski as the school's director in 1970, remaining there as director until 1974 when he was succeeded by Armando Santiago. However, Daveluy remained a member of the faculty for several years after he stepped down as director. A vocal music program with classes in singing was established in 1974 by Jacqueline Martel, eventually growing to include studies in opera and choral music. Some of the teaching staff appointed to the school during the 1970s included clarinetist Jean Laurendeau, horn player Joseph Masella, oboist Bernard Jean; organist Noëlla Genest; pianists Michel Dussault, Christiane Sénart, Nadia Strycek, and Denise Trudel- Bellemare; saxophonist Jacques Larocque; and trombonist Joseph Zuskin. Michelle Quintal taught theoretical subjects at the school and Gilles Bellemare was the school's main instructor in harmony and counterpoint. More recent directors of the CMQT include Georges Savaria (1979–1980), Roger Bédard (1980–1982), Jean Charron (1982–1986), Michel Kozlovsky (1986–1991), and Pierre Normandin (1991–2009).

This block marked the return to the plane of Mirrodin. This plane was last visited in the Mirrodin block that concluded in 2004. The interim tagline for the set was \\"The Corrosion Begins October 1, 2010.\\" The plans for this set were first made public by mananation.com when it was discovered that \\"Scars of Mirrodin\\", as well as \\"Mirrodin Pure\\" and \\"New Phyrexia\\" had been registered as trademarks with the US Patent and Trademark Office by Wizards of the Coast. As with the original Mirrodin block, artifacts make up the overarching theme of Scars of Mirrodin; Nearly half of all cards in the set are artifacts. In his May 24 column, Mark Rosewater confirmed that the \\"Infect\\" game mechanic in Scars of Mirrodin would bring poison counters back to Magic. All cards (other than basic lands) in the Scars of Mirrodin block carried a watermark, either Mirran or Phyrexian. Storyline The origins of New Phyrexia date back to the early design stages of the original Mirrodin set. The idea of Phyrexian oil influencing Mirrodin's evolution was included in the storyline for future use. New Phyrexia was originally planned to be the first set of the \\"Lights\\" block, with the storyline being set after the Phyrexians had already conquered Mirrodin. Eventually, designer Mark Rosewater made the decision to build the block around the war between the Mirrans and the Phyrexians, leading up to New Phyrexia after Scars of Mirrodin and Mirrodin Besieged. In the original announcement from December 9, 2010 it was left open whether this set would be named New Phyrexia or Mirrodin Pure. On March 29, 2011 Wizards of the Coast announced that New Phyrexia was going to be the name of the set. The tagline for Mirrodin Pure would have been \\"The Sharpest Steel is Tempered in Fire\\". Mechanics Scars of Mirrodin introduced the Phyrexian mechanics Infect and Proliferate, and the Mirran mechanics Metalcraft and Imprint. A creature with infect deals damage to creatures in the form of -1/-1 counters (much like Wither) and to players in the form of poison counters. A player with 10 or more poison counters loses the game. Proliferate allows players to give additional counters to any number of permanents and/or players they so choose who already have them. Imprint was a returning keyword from the original Mirrodin block, and allowed an artifact to gain additional effects if another card is exiled and imprinted on that artifact. Metalcraft rewards a player for having three or more artifacts in play. As with the original Mirrodin block, artifacts that were Equipment and/or were indestructible were printed. Besides expanding on mechanics from Scars, Mirrodin Besieged introduced the Mirran mechanic Battle Cry, and the Phyrexian mechanic Living Weapon. Whenever a creature with battle cry attacks, all other attacking creatures that player or team controls get +1/+0 until the end of the turn. Living weapon is found only on Equipment. When a piece of Equipment with \\"Living weapon\\" enters the battlefield, it creates a 0/0 Black Germ creature token and the Equipment is immediately attached to that token. It expanded on the poison counters mechanic by making certain things happen if players were poisoned. The four mechanics from Scars and living weapon returned for New Phyrexia. New Phyrexia introduced also Phyrexian Mana Symbols. Mana costs containing Phyrexian mana symbols can be paid with either the given color or two life per Phyrexian Mana symbol. In New Phyrexia, all permanent cards with Phyrexian Mana in their costs are colored artifacts.

It is best known for black humour lyrics and provocative public performances. Biography Sergey \\"Pauk\\" Troitsky, the band's leader and bassist Korrozia was founded in 1984 in Moscow by bass guitarist Sergey Troitsky, better known under stage name Pauk (Russian for \\"spider\\"). All other members of the band have also taken stage names: Boar (Sergey Vysokosov) - guitars, Schizophrenic - vocals, Clutch (Roman Lebedev) - guitars, Saxon (Vadim Mikhailov) - bass guitar, Morgue - drums. The band's first live show was illegally carried out in an apartment house basement. Annoyed by their noise, the neighbours called for police, which forced Korrozia to leave the stage. Shortly after this incident, they released their first single, a six- song cassette titled Vlast zla (The Power of Evil). The master tapes were lost, but the single kept circulating and eventually a high-quality second generation dub was given to Troitsky in 2001. Next year the band joined Moscow Rock Lab, which allowed the band to perform rock music legally. The band's first album, Orden Satany (Order of the Satan) was released in 1988. No Soviet state label was ready to release that kind of music, so Pauk created his own one, Hard Rock Corporation (HRC, Korporatsia Tyazhologo Roka, KTR, or КТР in Cyrillic). Before the album was recorded, Schizophrenic was fired and since then Boar performed vocals as well as guitar. Morgue was replaced by Yasher (Lizard). Orden Satany presented a raw thrash metal with heavy hardcore punk influence, the so-called crossover thrash. In late Soviet years, censorship was lifted, and Korrozia became notorious for lyrics and imagery that, although consistent with western shock rock traditions, were quite provocative by Soviet Russia's measures. For their live shows, they employed strip girls to dance on stage and decorated it with pyrotechnics and \\"satanic\\" imagery. Similarly, the band's lyrics consisted of black humour and strong language, describing violence, supernatural and sex. Korrozia Metalla albums were named Cannibal (1990) or Sadism (1992), and their 'trademark' songs include such titles as Vampire's Panzer , AIDS, Eat in the Flesh, Dead Rasputin. In 90s, Pauk eventually fired all the original line-up and both band’s lyrics and live performances changed to humorous political and military concept though of course there were many cases when some metal fans took it too seriously and blamed the band for its political views. But the band went on shocking and amusing the crowd. During the promotional tour for Computer Hitler album, Korrozia even employed world-famous politics and dictators impersonators for their extreme live shows. Pauk indicated his interest in politics when nominated himself for mayor of Moscow in 1993,Mayor of Moscow? Spider the Metalhead Is Ready to Serve , Wall Street Journal, 18. February 1993 and for mayor of Khimki in 2012 with a good sense of black humor as well. The band has long been associated with far-right political leanings; several of their songs have been banned and they are included in Russia's federal list of extremist materials in Russia for inciting inter-ethnic hatred.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/16/alexander-shprygin- russia-fan-deported-euros Korrozia's songs were covered by the number of artists. The band's best known song, Russian Vodka, was covered by KoldbrannKOLDBRANN: 'Russian Vodka / Metalni Bog' Seven-Inch Single Now Available - Sep. 9, 2009 and Aggressor.Estonian metal: Aggressor biography At the beginning of 2016, due to the local law, Korrozia Metalla's discography was removed from iTunes and Google Play Music. The only tracks that remain are three tracks from a compilations \\"Russian Metal Ballads\\" (the only Korrozia tracks available to Russian iTunes users) and the album \\"Samogon\\" (eng. \\"Moonshine\\") (which can only be purchased in the West). On 3 September 2016, Troitsky was arrested in Montenegro after the house he was staying at burned downhttp://www.mk.ru/incident/2016/09/07/pauka-troickogo-arestovali-v- chernogorii-za-podzhog-doma.html and was facing a sentence of 5 years in prison, however Troitsky was sentenced to 10 months, of which he served 6.

Between 1935 and 1960, Simplex made variations of the Simplex Servi-Cycle including the 1953-1960 Simplex Automatic. Simplex was the only motorcycle manufacturer located in the Deep South for many years, until Confederate Motorcycles began production. History Simplex was founded by Paul Treen (father of United States Congressman and Louisiana Governor David Conner Treen) in New Orleans, Louisiana in the late 1920s with an initial investment of $25. Treen had been a dealer in Harley-Davidson motorcycles and had pitched them the idea of making a lightweight motorcycle for young riders. When Harley-Davidson rejected the idea, Treen decided to enter the market himself and designed his Servi-Cycle. The Simplex Servi-Cycle was introduced in 1935. Although Simplex Manufacturing Corporation produced motorcycles for over 20 years, the last Simplex Automatics looked almost the same as the company's original 1935 Simplex Servi-Cycle motorcycle. Paul Treen would often visit the factory's tool shop and work with the engineers on new ideas himself, resulting in continuous improvements to Simplex products instead of annual new model introductions. Western Auto sold Simplex motorcycles under the Wizard brand in the mid-1950s. Simplex's minimalist philosophy was maintained throughout the company's history, whose designs changed little after 1935. By the 1950s Simplex's designs were primitive, leading to the end of Servi-Cycle and Automatic production in 1960. Simplex continued to make minibikes and karts using proprietary small engines until 1975, when Simplex went out of business. Treen had sold the company three years earlier, in 1972. Simplex was the only motorcycle manufacturer located in the American South. A 1935 Simplex Servi-Cycle motorcycle is currently on display in the Smithsonian Institution's America on the Move exhibit. Engine The two-stroke engine had a rotary valve and an \\"overhung\\" crankshaft with only one main bearing. A kick-starter was added by 1953. The Servi-Cycle was claimed to have a fuel economy of .How Stuff Works: 1956 Simplex Automatic The Servi-Cycle used a magneto of Simplex's own design, providing 6 volt electricity for the dual ignition and for the headlight, taillight and stoplight. The engine had dual spark plugs in its cylinder head. Transmission The original Servi-Cycle design had the engine drive the rear wheel by belt, with no transmission or clutch, requiring the engine to be shut off while the cycle is at rest. In 1941, a pedal-operated clutch was added. By 1950, Simplex added a belt-type automatic transmission. The ratio was changed by expanding and contracting the drive pulley, with a low ratio of approximately 18:1 and a high ratio of approximately 7:1. The transmission was belt-driven and drove the real wheel by belt, with automatic belt tensioning by jockey pulley. Simplex Automatic scooter In 1956, Simplex began manufacturing a scooter based on the Simplex Automatic drivetrain. The scooter was not made in large numbers and was discontinued in 1960 along with the Servi-Cycle.

The company operated 14 cars at its peak in 1913, and was down to 10 by 1918. Rates were increased with approval of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission from 5 cents to 7 cents on December 1, 1918. 25 cents bought four rides, a dollar bought seventeen. The city council later refused to let the company raise fares above 7 cents. Demise of the System On August 29, 1929, the Enid city Council passed an ordinance outlawing the entire street car system. Manager Morris McGrath, ignored the ruling, and continued operation. One streetcar operator, A.T. Snowder was arrested. The chief of police threatened to arrest McGrath on August 31, 1929, if he didn't cease operation. That same day, city busses began operation, and in September, the overhead wires were removed.

A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark on 10 November 1843. As was customary at the time however, the title page is dated 1844. The tales are completely Andersen's invention, owe no debt to folk or fairy lore, and are the most autobiographical of his several fairy tale collections. The collection was received enthusiastically by the Danish critics and public and became Andersen's break-through in the fairy tale genre. \\"The Nightingale\\" and \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" have been adapted to various forms of drama.  Contents  All the tales are Andersen's invention and the collection is the most autobiographical of his many works in the fairy tale genre. Andersen himself is the several heroes and heroines in the collection's tales - the awkward duckling, the nightingale, the gilded top.Wullschlager 2000, 236 \\"The Angel\\" tells of a dead child and an angel gathering flowers for Heaven. In a poverty-ridden section of the city, the angel retrieves a lily from a trash heap and explains the flower had cheered a dying child. The angel reveals he was that child. Andersen had been attracted to the sentimental 'dying child' theme since composing the poem, \\"The Dying Child\\", during his school days but the immediate catalyst was probably the death of the daughter of Edvard Collin, Andersen's close friend and lifelong homoerotic obsession. The tale suited the taste of the times and was wildly popular. The angel and child were depicted in a print that sold millions of copies.Wullschlager 2000. p.235 In \\"The Nightingale\\", the Emperor of China enjoys the songs of both a real nightingale and a mechanical bird. When the mechanical bird breaks down and the Emperor is close to death, the real nightingale's song restores his health. The tale's Chinese setting was inspired by the then recently opened Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, and memorializes Andersen's unrequited love for singer Jenny Lind. The tale was completed in 24 hours on 12 October 1843.Wullschlager 2000, p.230 \\"The Nightingale\\" sets out in fairy tale form Andersen's artistic manifesto: naturalness and simplicity triumphing over artifice and reason.Wullsclager 2000, p.233 The tale is a variation on his earlier The Swineherd.Bredsdorff 1975, p.164 Illustration (1850) by Vilhelm Pedersen, Andersen's first illustrator \\"The Sweethearts; or, The Top and the Ball\\" tells of the unrequited love suffered by a mahogany top for a leather ball. When the top discovers the ball years later lying in the dustbin faded and dirty, he refuses to recognize her. The tale is likely based on Andersen's youthful passion for lovely Riborg Voight, a woman who refused his marriage proposal in 1830. He met her again in 1843 when she had become a frumpy, middle-aged matron. The tale is sometimes viewed as a counterpiece to \\"The Nightingale\\" in its ushering out of an old love (Voight) and the welcoming in of a new one (Lind). In \\"The Ugly Duckling\\", an awkward and ungainly bird is ostracized by his barnyard fellows and wanders alone and unhappy until, to everyone's surprise, he matures into a swan, the loveliest bird of all. Andersen spent more than a year writing the tale, and, at one time, said The Ugly Duckling was his autobiography. The tale celebrates the cherished romantic view of genius over background and culture - \\"it doesn't matter being born in a duckyard if you're hatched from a swan's egg!\\" Of Andersen's many tales of transformation, \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" has gained the greatest universal appeal. Thirty years after its publication, the Spectator wrote that the tale was - like Solomon's proverbs - \\"in everyone's mouth\\" and the tale was one of those \\"happy arrows that hit the bull's eye.\\"Wullschlager 2000, pp.234-5  Themes  The prevailing theme of the collection is that of transformation and it is worked as social comedy, religious awakening, and artistic revelation. The collection is the most optimistic in Andersen's output since his fairy tale debut in 1835 but unlike the breezy, bouncy tone of the early tales, these four speak to adult fulfillment, of pain transformed to pleasure via suffering and understanding.Wullschlager 2000, p.231  Critical reception  New Fairy Tales was a break-through for Andersen who, until its publication, had generally received vigorous condemnation from the Danish critics for his venture into the fairy tale genre. Reviews for the collection however were ecstatic. Ny Portefeuille wrote, \\"There is in these tales so much beauty and goodness, so much humour and seriousness, so much poetry and depth, that even the most disparate readers will by necessity find something of interest to them.\\" Andersen wrote his confidante Henriette Wulff, \\"These tales have been received with unanimous applause. None of my other books have had such a success here at home, every paper commends them, everyone reads them [...] I am appreciated as the best fairy-tale teller.\\"Andersen 2005, p.330Bredsdorff 1975, p.165  Notes  References    Further reading   Category:1843 books Category:1843 short stories Category:Collections of fairy tales Category:Works by Hans Christian Andersen Category:1840s children's books ","title":"New Fairy Tales (1844)"},{"id":"26598866","text":"Cotton Row Historic District may refer to: *Cotton Row Historic District (Greenwood, Mississippi), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Leflore County, Mississippi *Cotton Row Historic District (Memphis, Tennessee), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Shelby County, Tennessee ","title":"Cotton Row Historic District"},{"id":"26598877","text":"Samuel Sloan (December 25, 1817 - September 22, 1907) was an American politician, businessman and executive. He is most known for his tenure as the president of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W;) for 32 years. Early life Samuel Sloan was born in Lisburn, County Down, Ireland to William and Elizabeth Sloan and moved to New York when he was one year old. He attended the Columbia College Preparatory school until he was 14, at the time of his father's death. After withdrawing, he became employed at an importing house in New York, eventually becoming the head of the firm. On April 8, 1844, Sloan married Margaret Elmendorf in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and moved to Brooklyn, New York. They had eleven children. Career Sloan was elected as a Supervisor in Kings County (Brooklyn) in 1852, and was president of the Long Island College Hospital. He became a director of the Hudson River Railroad in 1855, left the importing business in 1857 and was elected to the New York State Senate, where he served for two years. He became a director of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad in 1864, and became its president in 1867. Prior to accepting the DL&W; Presidency, Sloan had declined an offer to become President of the New York and Harlem Railroad. He extended the DL&W; rail lines, and the company achieved great success, in part due to the traffic generated for transport of anthracite coal mined in the railway's expanded territory. Passenger traffic also increased, particularly between New York City and the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a popular resort area. Sloan resigned from the DL&W; presidency in 1899, but continued as Chairman of the Board. He served on the boards of banks, utilities and other companies. Death Samuel Sloan died in Garrison, New York, in 1907 at the age of 89, having been the president of seventeen corporations during his lifetime. Hoboken Legacy Samuel Sloan is the eponym of the city of Sloan, Iowa and the village of Sloan, New York. Statue A statue memorializing Sloan was placed in Hoboken, New Jersey, originally facing the ferries in 1899. Some people criticized the statue's orientation, and the Mayor of Hoboken remarked that Sloan was \\"turning his back on the great city of Hoboken.\\" On August 3, 1908, during the reconstruction of Hoboken Terminal, the statue was set facing both the town and the railroad and ferry stations.

The South Korean government selected Jeju, in June 2009, as the Smart Grid Test-bed, and broke ground in August 2009. Testbed is the very proof of a Smart Grid, the basis for a low carbon, green growth strategy. Therefore, this project demonstrates Korea’s aspiration for green growth. Jeju Smart Grid Test-bed will become the world’s largest Smart Grid community that allows the testing of the most advanced Smart Grid technologies and R&D; results, as well as the development of business models. This Test-bed will also serve as the foundation for the commercialization and industrial export of Smart Grid technologies. It is expected to greatly contribute to strengthening Korea’s position as a leader in the global Smart Grid industry.This project is conducted with the participation of the Korean government, Korea Smart Grid Institute (KSGI), KEPCO, the Jeju Special Autonomous Province, companies joining the complex, Korea Smart Grid Association, research institutes, and academia. A total of 64.5 billion won will be injected between 2009 and 2013. About 10 consortiums in five areas will participate in testing technologies and developing business models. The three strategic directions stated in the vision and goals of the Jeju Smart Grid Test-bed initiative clearly show the nature of a green-growth strategy embedded in this project. From the national standpoint, this project aims to raise energy efficiency and implement green-energy infrastructure by building eco-friendly infrastructure that reduces CO2 emissions. From the industrial standpoint, this project seeks to secure a new growth engine that will drive Korea in the age of green growth. And from an individual standpoint, this project is headed for low carbon and green life by enhancing quality of life through experiences of and participation in a low carbon, green life. Test-bed background The Korean government announced its CO2 reduction target for 2020. Among the three options it had considered, Seoul chose the most stringent goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 4% from 2005 levels. The target represents a 30% reduction from the estimated level of 2020. This goal is deemed very challenging since Korean industry had doubled its greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2005, the fastest growth in the OECD. Korea has voluntarily set its 2020 emission reduction target. With this pledge, Seoul seeks to be a model for other countries including China and India who are categorized as developing countries under the Kyoto Protocol; the two countries thus have no binding obligation but to announce its reduction target by 2030. Korea is also pursuing sustainable development while dealing with climate change. At the same time, it is shifting toward a low carbon economy and a society capable of recovering from climate change. As part of these efforts, Korea launched a Smart Grid national project to achieve green growth in a transparent, comprehensive, effective, and efficient way. This project envisions laying the foundation for a low carbon, green-growth economy by building a Smart Grid. Thus, it can serve as a yardstick to evaluate the future of Korea’s green-growth economy. In light of this, Korea came up with a proactive and ambitious plan to build a Smart Grid Test-bed on Jeju Island to prove its determination in the low carbon, green-growth strategy.

In 1777, during worship services, word came to the congregation by way of an express rider, that the British General Howe was about to invade Pennsylvania. The message relayed was that the British army had advanced and had forced Washington's troops to retreat to Chadds Ford. The rider found Colonel Alexander Lowry, who was attending worship at Donegal that Sunday, and shared the news with him, to encourage Lowry to organize his men to come to General Washington's defense. Upon learning this news, the congregation gathered around a white oak tree just outside the sanctuary. With hands joined, they vowed allegiance to the cause of the patriots, and their minister, Rev. Colin McFarquhar, who up until that time had always prayed for the King of England, united with them. From that time onward, the tree was known as the “Witness Tree.”Donegal Society brochure from Donegal Presbyterian Church The original Witness Tree grew and flourished for nearly three centuries, but succumbed to disease.

He is also known for having played an important role in the founding of the INCAE Business School campus in Costa Rica, as well as founding the Costa Rican non-profit organization Asociación de Empresarios para el Desarrollo. Early life Walter Kissling was born to Walter Kissling Rickli and Adela Gam Secen in Limón, Costa Rica on April 25, 1931. His father was of Swiss descent, and his mother came from Vienna, Austria. In a newspaper interview in 1998 he mentioned his mother as driving force in his life. “She was a fighting woman. She descended from wealthy family from Vienna, who had lost it all in the First World War. During all of my infancy, one of very limited means, it was through my mother’s efforts that I was able to study and get ahead.” Kissling graduated from Colegio Seminario in San José in 1948. After graduation he worked selling cheese and as a receptionist in the Hotel Europa in downtown San José. During his work at the hotel, he met a North American businessman who gave him 2 pamphlets and told him that if he learned them by heart he would hire him as a pharmaceutical sales representative. This is how he started working at Wyeth International, he worked there for 7 years. Kissling never graduated from college. Work in Kativo and H.B. Fuller Seeking to advance his career, Kissling joined Kativo Chemical in 1953. At that time the company was a small business that fabricated the Protecto brand of paints in a workshop in Sabana Sur, San José. He worked there for 10 years and was tasked with leading the expansion of the company to the Central American markets. With the acquisition of Kativo Chemical by H.B. Fuller in 1967, Kissling was appointed as vicepresident for Latin America, all the while maintaining his role as general manager at Kativo Chemical. He then led the opening of several H.B Fuller manufacturing plants throughout Latin America. He went on to serve the company in significant leadership positions, including senior vice president of international operations, and executive vice president and chief operating officer. In 1995 he was named chief executive officer of H.B. Fuller, serving in this capacity until his retirement in 1998. He also was a 34-year member of Fuller's board of directors. Other activities Kissling had an active role in the founding of the Costa Rican Campus (now named after him) of the INCAE Business School in 1984, after the situation of the INCAE campus in Nicaragua became unstable due to the Nicaraguan Revolution. He was also president and a 16-year member of the board of directors of INCAE. He was president of La Camara de Industrias de Costa Rica and served on the boards of several companies including: La Nación, Atlas Eléctrica, Banco Banex, and Pentair Inc. Later life Kissling spent most of his later life promoting Corporate Social Responsibility in Costa Rica. In 1997 he founded Asociación Empresarial para el Desarrollo a non profit organization that promotes Corporate Social Responsibility in Costa Rica. He died on January 28, 2002 following a battle with cancer. He was 70. Legacy The INCAE Business School named its Campus in Costa Rica in his honor. Many Costa Rican business leaders consider Walter Kissling as the Franklin Chang- Diaz (notable Costa Rican - American astronaut) of Costa Rican business because of his achievements.

History The first European settler in the area came from Connecticut in the late 18th century. In 1768 public lands were set aside in the area for churches by the Susquehanna Company, but because of the Yankee- Pennamite Wars and the American Revolution actual building of the churches was delayed by over 30 years. An unfinished meetinghouse nearby was destroyed after the Battle of Wyoming in 1778. Joseph Hitchcock of New Haven, Connecticut, who also designed the Old Ship Zion Church in Wilkes-Barre, designed the meetinghouse. It was the first completed church used for religious services in the area. It was a Union Church with both Congregationalist (now Presbyterians) and Methodists worshipping in the church. By 1837, both groups had built their own churches, and the meetinghouse has been used rarely since. In 1869, the Forty Fort Cemetery Association was created by the Pennsylvania state legislature and the Association still owns the church and cemetery.Forty Fort Meetinghouse, National Park Service, accessed April 17, 2011.

In 1891, Dillard was named a professor at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. There, he became increasingly active in advocating for black education. He led the Jeanes Fund from 1907 to 1931 and also led the Slater Fund for seven years. Following the merger of two black colleges in New Orleans in 1930, Dillard University was founded and was named in his honor. Personal life Dillard's house in New Orleans Dillard was born in Nansemond County, Virginia, on October 24, 1856. His parents, James and Sara Brownrigg (Cross) Dillard, were slave owners.

Priestley spaces are named after Hilary Priestley who introduced and investigated them. Priestley, (1970). Priestley spaces play a fundamental role in the study of distributive lattices. In particular, there is a duality (\\"Priestley duality\\") between the category of Priestley spaces and the category of bounded distributive lattices. Cornish, (1975).Bezhanishvili et al. (2010) Definition A Priestley space is an ordered topological space , i.e. a set equipped with a partial order and a topology , satisfying the following two conditions: # is compact. # If \\\\scriptstyle x\\\\, ot\\\\le\\\\, y, then there exists a clopen up-set of such that and . (This condition is known as the Priestley separation axiom.) Properties of Priestley spaces * Each Priestley space is Hausdorff. Indeed, given two points of a Priestley space , if , then as is a partial order, either \\\\scriptstyle x\\\\, ot\\\\le\\\\, y or \\\\scriptstyle y\\\\, ot\\\\le\\\\, x. Assuming, without loss of generality, that \\\\scriptstyle x\\\\, ot\\\\le\\\\, y, (ii) provides a clopen up-set of such that and . Therefore, and are disjoint open subsets of separating and . * Each Priestley space is also zero-dimensional; that is, each open neighborhood of a point of a Priestley space contains a clopen neighborhood of . To see this, one proceeds as follows. For each , either \\\\scriptstyle x\\\\, ot\\\\le\\\\, y or \\\\scriptstyle y\\\\, ot\\\\le\\\\, x. By the Priestley separation axiom, there exists a clopen up-set or a clopen down-set containing and missing . The intersection of these clopen neighborhoods of does not meet . Therefore, as is compact, there exists a finite intersection of these clopen neighborhoods of missing . This finite intersection is the desired clopen neighborhood of contained in . It follows that for each Priestley space , the topological space is a Stone space; that is, it is a compact Hausdorff zero-dimensional space. Some further useful properties of Priestley spaces are listed below. Let be a Priestley space. ::(a) For each closed subset of , both and are closed subsets of . ::(b) Each open up-set of is a union of clopen up-sets of and each open down- set of is a union of clopen down-sets of . ::(c) Each closed up-set of is an intersection of clopen up-sets of and each closed down-set of is an intersection of clopen down-sets of . ::(d) Clopen up-sets and clopen down- sets of form a subbasis for . ::(e) For each pair of closed subsets and of , if , then there exists a clopen up-set such that and . A Priestley morphism from a Priestley space to another Priestley space is a map which is continuous and order-preserving. Let Pries denote the category of Priestley spaces and Priestley morphisms. Connection with spectral spaces Priestley spaces are closely related to spectral spaces. For a Priestley space , let denote the collection of all open up-sets of . Similarly, let denote the collection of all open down-sets of . Theorem:Cornish, (1975). Bezhanishvili et al. (2010). If is a Priestley space, then both and are spectral spaces. Conversely, given a spectral space , let denote the patch topology on ; that is, the topology generated by the subbasis consisting of compact open subsets of and their complements. Let also denote the specialization order of . Theorem:Cornish, (1975). Bezhanishvili et al. (2010). If is a spectral space, then is a Priestley space. In fact, this correspondence between Priestley spaces and spectral spaces is functorial and yields an isomorphism between Pries and the category Spec of spectral spaces and spectral maps. Connection with bitopological spaces Priestley spaces are also closely related to bitopological spaces. Theorem:Bezhanishvili et al. (2010). If is a Priestley space, then is a pairwise Stone space. Conversely, if is a pairwise Stone space, then is a Priestley space, where is the join of and and is the specialization order of . The correspondence between Priestley spaces and pairwise Stone spaces is functorial and yields an isomorphism between the category Pries of Priestley spaces and Priestley morphisms and the category PStone of pairwise Stone spaces and bi-continuous maps. Thus, one has the following isomorphisms of categories: \\\\mathbf{Spec}\\\\cong \\\\mathbf{Pries}\\\\cong \\\\mathbf{PStone} One of the main consequences of the duality theory for distributive lattices is that each of these categories is dually equivalent to the category of bounded distributive lattices.

Established in 2005, the center describes its mission as \\"educate the hearts of children by informing, inspiring and engaging the communities around them\\". The organization is advised by several prominent leaders involved in peace-making and has organized events centered on discussions of spirituality, climate change, the environment, peace and other topics. History and mission The 14th Dalai Lama's ties with Vancouver, Canada date from the early 1960s when Vancouver-based writer George Woodcock traveled to India to support Tibetan exiles and met the Dalai Lama. Over the years, the Dalai Lama visited Vancouver several times, in 1980, 1993, 2004, 2006 and 2009. The Dalai Lama's brother, Tendzin Choegyal, also has close ties with the city, having traveled there often to give speeches and teach. Victor Chan, a 30-year friend of the Dalai Lama, is founding director of the center. Chan co-authored a book with the Dalai Lama called, The Wisdom of Forgiveness. According to the Dalai Lama, Vancouver was chosen as the center's location because it is \\"multiethnic and multiracial population gives it harmony.\\" The center was formally inaugurated in September 2006 in Vancouver. The Dalai Lama, in attendance at the event, was awarded honorary Canadian citizenship by the government of Canada. Also attending the inauguration were Tim Shriver, Deepak Chopra, and Sonja Lyubomirsky. James Hoggan & Associates provided public relations services for the event. The center originally announced its intention to have a permanent facility constructed by 2009. In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver Sun, Chan explained that the center's facility would be 4,645 square meters and include an outdoor European-style piazza, Zen garden, bookstore, film-screening theater, performing arts theater, art gallery, library, and studios for classes or group discussions. Chan stated that the facility would highlight the Dalai Lama's international connections, invite guest speakers, host interfaith dialogues, and hold discussions on peaceful resolutions to conflicts. Chan added that half of the center's $60 million budget would go to operating costs, research, local programming, and an endowment, and the rest towards construction of the facility and a meditative retreat.

As he playfully sees it, scientific expeditions will have given way to hordes of tourists crowding the scene – an ethnic cross section of newlyweds, college students, children grimacing at the camera, and ordinary sightseers rather than heroic astronauts. Viewers are left to ponder the political and social implications of such conquest of outer space. One does not expect any special intelligence in work such as this. So all the more is our surprise on encountering Itagaki's challenge to us to consider what the future may bring. Besides, his chosen medium, photography, already had played a crucial role in space exploration. Seamlessly, then, he offers a continuing probe.\\" Victoria Donohoe, The Philadelphia Inquirer, 11/2000 * \\"Through the miracle of digital technology, this Japanese-born New York artist produces photomontages depicting ordinary tourists on the moon, with the earth looming over the horizon in every case. In another series, tourists are inserted into video game scenes. Something about the disconnected rootlessness of modern life is implied.\\" Ken Johnson (art critic), The New York Times, 9/2000. * \\"We have to at least ask the question, \\"what if there is no life anywhere in the universe, except here, on earth?\\" If we are the only living creature anywhere, well, that means there is a lot of countries out there to visit, which inspired a photographer, Yoshio Itagaki to imagine the universe as one big tourist attraction. With every new planet, in every new star, there is a photo opportunity, smile! Because if we are alone, then the universe is one big empty vacation land...\\" narration from Brave New World series on ABC Network \\"Nightline\\" with Ted Koppel, 9/1999 * \\"Yoshio Itagaki makes us aware of a shift in public attitude toward space science and exploration that you might not have noticed, because it occurred gradually. Thirty years ago, space travel was still adventurous and even heroic. Now it's so routine that we hardly notice when a space shuttle takes off or lands. Space travel has been domesticated to the point that the danger and technological wizardry have become banal, if not invisible. Itagaki offers a composite photo that would have seemed fantastic a half-century ago – a Japanese wedding party posed on the moon, with earth rising in the background. We've seen the original picture of the site so many times that now it's just as amusing curiosity.\\" Edward J. Sozanski, The Philadelphia Inquirer, 12/2000 * \\"Yoshio Itagaki uses digital means to play on humorous stereotypes. Whether Japanese weddings, banished Native Americans or global tourists, Itagaki photographs images of people being photographed on the moon.

RedZone provides \\"whip around\\" simulcast coverage of all Sunday afternoon games airing in-progress on CBS and Fox. RedZone is based out of the NFL Network studios and is hosted by Scott Hanson, and airs commercial-free. The channel prides itself on showing \\"every touchdown from every game,\\" and is closely linked to Fantasy Football, reporting superlatives and tracking various statistical accomplishments throughout the afternoon. RedZone monitors coverage of the traditional Sunday afternoon 1:00 p.m. \\"early\\" games and 4:05/4:25 p.m. \\"late\\" games. RedZone is offered by numerous cable providers, Dish Network, and Verizon Wireless smartphones, but specifically is not available on DirecTV, which offers its own version (Red Zone Channel hosted by Andrew Siciliano) as part of NFL Sunday Ticket. ESPN Goal Line, a channel which debuted one year later, broadcast college football with a similar format and style until the end of the 2019 season.

The countdown clock counts down the minutes and seconds until the start of the game coverage. Whip around coverage At 1:00 p.m. (Eastern) the RedZone program begins, and immediately dives into live look-ins across the league. Host Scott Hanson gives a brief introduction of the day, highlighting key developing stories, as teams are typically already lining up for opening kickoff. When the first kickoff takes place, Hanson will say \\"Seven hours of commercial-free football... starts now!\\" Coverage of the opening kickoffs and a cursory look at early drives that are being established are the initial focus. Coverage is normally shown in full-screen, with one particular game as the primary focus for the moment. The coverage is a direct simulcast of the CBS or Fox broadcast feed and commentary, with only occasional and usually brief voice-over comments by Hanson as needed. Coverage sometimes switches to split-screen, with two, three, four (\\"quad-box\\"), five (\\"Penta-box\\"), or as many as eight (\\"Octo-box\\") game feeds being shown simultaneously. Producers in the studio monitor all game feeds in-progress, and decide which game to feature at any given moment. NFL television rules are exempted for RedZone, and live look-ins of games that are subject to blackout are still allowed to be aired in all markets. Whenever a team enters the red zone, the coverage will switch to a full-screen live look-in of that game's television broadcast. It will attempt to cover a potential scoring result (touchdown or field goal). Meanwhile, the other games continue to be monitored, in case the need arises to switch to another feed at short notice. Field goal attempts from outside the red zone are sometimes shown, either live or in replay, if they pose significance to the outcome of the respective game. As the games enter halftime, the coverage shifts over to games still finishing up the second quarter, even if there are no teams in the red zone. Some noncompetitive games that would otherwise not be looked at may take the attention for a few minutes, in order to fill the broadcast with as much live football coverage as possible. As soon as better games start returning for the third quarter, second half kickoffs typically take a priority. If there are no teams in the red zone at a given moment, the focus may shift to a team on a strong offensive drive, or an otherwise important game of the day. Despite the channel's moniker, a team does not have to be inside the red zone for the focus and coverage to shift to that game. During the latter portion of the season, extra sidebar attention may be given to teams fighting for playoff berths, and the respective status thereof. The \\"whip around\\" coverage also is used to show quick replays of major plays such as turnovers, deep pass completions, very long runs from scrimmage, kickoff/punt return touchdowns, and other potentially interesting or important key plays. The \\"Game Rewind\\" feature is sometimes used to replay a significant play that resulted in a particular team entering the red zone. Hanson rarely takes any kind of rest break during RedZone's seven hours on the air, and since the early years of the channel he has purposefully planned out his eating and drinking schedule during the regular season to avoid any need for a restroom break, having boasted on Twitter on December 10, 2017 (that year's Week 14) about his first restroom break in four years of NFL RedZone coverage. It is not unusual for RedZone to switch between two or more games in quick succession, even between individual plays. Despite an effort made by producers to air all touchdowns live, some scoring plays are actually aired after a very brief time shift – ranging from as much as 30 to 60 seconds – sometimes because another scoring play is unfolding elsewhere. Time shifting can also occur if the scoring play happened unexpectedly, and/or initiated from outside the red zone. In those cases, the coverage is aired plausibly live with no mention that the coverage is slightly behind real time (though Hanson often tries to introduce the switch with some kind of segue, such as 'while we were watching that (play)...' to note it isn't live video). As the 1 p.m. \\"early\\" games begin to conclude, RedZone seamlessly leads into coverage of the 4:05/4:25 p.m. \\"late\\" games, though on afternoons where all early game action has ended, extended statistical rundowns and check-ins on team press conferences may occur to fill the time before those late games start. When the \\"early\\" games are in the fourth quarter, attention begins to focus on one- possession games (games within 8 points). Likewise, early games that go into overtime are usually prioritized, but neither at the expense of missing touchdowns in other games that just started. As the 4 p.m. \\"late\\" games begin to arrive at their conclusions, coverage will likewise narrow down to the remaining games still ongoing. At which time there is only one game left being played, coverage will switch to full-screen and see out its conclusion, irrespective of its competitiveness. When each game is concluded, a final score alert will flash on the bottom corner of the screen to inform viewers. This is especially important for games that have not had a live look-in for many minutes. Periodically throughout the afternoon, producers keep track of and update viewers on the status of fantasy football statistics, and/or other statistical superlatives. The channel's priority, however, is to show every touchdown scored in every game throughout the afternoon. During the entire day, RedZone features a ticker at the bottom of the screen, updating scores and stats throughout the league. The ticker is situated in such a way that it is superimposed over the respective tickers of CBS and FOX. On occasion, technical difficulties could prevent RedZone from showing certain touchdowns live. During Week 1 in the 2019 season, a technical issue with the CBS broadcast prevented a live look at a touchdown in the Kansas City Chiefs- Jacksonville Jaguars game; the touchdown was later shown using video from the scoreboard at TIAA Bank Field. Similar issues prevented two touchdowns in the Buffalo Bills-Miami Dolphins game from being broadcast live; both touchdowns were later aired on replay (with one aired from the Dolphins' Instagram feed). Commercial-free format RedZone operates as a commercial-free service; as such, whenever a game taking primary focus goes to a broadcaster-designated commercial break or other stoppage (such as timeout, instant replay challenge or an injury timeout), the feed will immediately switch to the next most- interesting game in-progress at the moment. Despite the network's commercial- free commitment, commercials are not completely avoided as sometimes the network coverage may take a break faster than expected, causing the first second or two of a commercial to air, before RedZone quickly cuts to another game, which usually includes Hanson jokingly playing off the brush with the accompanying commercial with some kind of snark. Additionally, broadcast network promotions of their programming (most notably CBS and Fox promoting their Sunday night primetime lineups) will be shown as a natural part of the coverage. If all games being held at a given moment are on a commercial break or in halftime, coverage will revert to the studio for brief commentary, replays, or statistical analysis by Hanson. In the \\"late\\" timeslot (when there are fewer games to choose from), highlight packages of selected \\"early\\" games may be shown during down times. Touchdown montage and sign-off The network's broadcast day ends when the final Sunday afternoon game concludes, or at 8:00 p.m. (Eastern). At the conclusion of the coverage, an edited montage of every touchdown scored throughout the afternoon is aired. Until 2018, due to contractual obligations, RedZone was required to sign off no later than 8:00 p.m., even if a late afternoon game(s) was still in progress; this was rectified in the 2019 season, an any game that ends after 8:00 p.m. will continue airing on RedZone until its conclusion. If the RedZone signs-off with inadequate time for the touchdown montage (which can vary from 5–10 minutes in duration), it will be posted online instead. At the onset, the total number of touchdowns for the afternoon by type (offensive, defensive, and special teams) is listed on a graphic, with a running tally for the entire season also shown. In some cases, when games are running close to the 8:00 p.m. deadline, the touchdown montage has been shown in a split-screen format. The montage is shown in a prominent square with audio, while the game still being played is shown in a lesser square in the corner of the screen without audio. This is done particularly when the game still being played is a nationally-televised game – a situation in which most viewers in most markets across the country (per NFL television rules) could simply switch to CBS or FOX to watch the game to its conclusion.The split-screen format for the Touchdown Montage was used on September 21, 2014; at the time in which the Denver at Seattle game went into overtime. The network instructed viewers to switch to CBS if they wanted to see the game out to its conclusion, though it concluded just a minute before off-air time and was taken to full-screen to conclude the day's schedule. However, it is possible that the 8:00 p.m. deadline is no longer enforced. During week 1 of the 2019 season, the Detroit Lions-Arizona Cardinals game went to overtime and extended past the deadline. Redzone continued showing the game to its completion and then showed the full TD montage, not signing off until past the 8:20 p.m. start of Sunday Night Football. Off-air periods After the broadcast day ends (≈ 8:00 p.m.) RedZone remains dark until the following Sunday. During the week, as well as during playoffs and off-season, a generic title card advertisement is shown, accompanied by music from NFL Films. However, cable providers may overlay their own tie-in title card. Providers are disallowed from using the channel space for other purposes during its off-time. While the RedZone channel is only utilized for Sunday afternoon games, in the unique instance in which Christmas Day falls on a Sunday, and the full slate of Week 16 afternoon games is switched to Saturday, the RedZone channel is activated for that Saturday afternoon schedule. RedZone is not on-air during Thursday night, Sunday night, Monday night, and any stand-alone Saturday night games, nor for NFL International Series games which are scheduled in an early Sunday morning timeslot. It also does not cover Thanksgiving games or postseason games. During the offseason breaks since the 2016 season, NFL Network has re-ran the previous season's RedZone presentations. During seventeen selected Sunday afternoons in the spring and early summer, all seventeen weeks of the regular season as seen on RedZone are re-aired, with editing for length and content and ad breaks inserted. The 2019 re-run of the season was compressed in April 2020 to air throughout the month on consecutive days on a thrice-daily loop on the RedZone channel space, due to the coronavirus pandemic leaving the network wanting of content not involving live studio shows for the safety of their staff, as their facilities in California and the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area were closed due to stay-at-home orders and to allow NFL Network's traditional Draft run-up shows to air. Another rerun of seventeen consecutive days was done during what is usually the pre-season in late August, which was cancelled out in full, leaving the channel without its usual preview night in the last week of the pre-season. Preseason Through 2013, during select nights of the preseason, special \\"whip around\\" coverage aired on the primary NFL Network. It followed the same style as RedZone and utilized the same production team and host. Starting in 2014, preseason \\"whip around\\" coverage moved to the RedZone channel itself. On four selected nights in August RedZone aired as part of a free preview of the service for all providers. Week 1 (Friday), weeks 2–3 (Saturday), and week 4 (Thursday) of the preseason featured the familiar \\"whip around\\" coverage. The broadcast utilized national and local team coverage feeds, as most preseason games are carried through regional sports networks or 'state/team networks' made up of local broadcast stations. Coverage started at 7:00 p.m. ET In 2015, RedZone aired a free preview during the preseason for five selected nights, and during Week 1 of the regular season. In 2016, RedZone aired a free preview on four selected nights during the preseason starting August 11 and during Week 1 of the regular season. In 2017, RedZone aired only once during preseason.

Some carriers might carry NFL Network available on their main digital tier, while RedZone might be relegated to a digital sports tier at an additional cost. Access to the network is available through the Watch NFL Network mobile app via a subscriber's TV Everywhere credentials if offered by their provider. Before the 2018 season, the app was one of the few exceptions where some form of access to NFL games is offered beyond Verizon Wireless subscribers due to that provider's mobile rights exclusivity (That season, Verizon-owned Yahoo Sports opened its live NFL streams to users from other mobile phone providers). Including the 17 Sundays of the NFL regular season, and as many as five special broadcasts during the preseason, RedZone broadcasts a total of 18–22 days out of the year. In the United Kingdom, NFL RedZone is available as a Red Button option to Sky Digitalhttp://www.marketwire.com/press-release/sky- sports-uk-screen-nfl-redzone-live-highlights-1369990.htm and Virgin Media subscribers. Since 2014, NFL RedZone aired in Australia on ESPN Australia until 2019. In Canada, starting in 2020, NFL RedZone is included for subscribers of TSN through TSN.ca and the TSN Go mobile app. A French-language version is also available on RDS.ca and RDS Direct. ESPN Latin America began to air NFL RedZone in 2016.Nueva temporada de la NFL en ESPN – ESPN Media Zone Latinoamérica, 6 September 2016 It features two pairs of Spanish-language announcers, one for the early games and another for the late games. Criticism RedZone has generally received favorable to positive reviews, and its product has been referred to as a form of new media. One source of criticism stems from RedZone potentially drawing viewers away from the traditional broadcasts on CBS and Fox, and likewise devaluing the commercial values for advertisers. Other minor complaints deal with viewers not seeing equal coverage of all games across the league, the inability to see outstanding defensive team performances (outside of defensive scores), and emphasis on individual players instead of teams. Games in the \\"early\\" time slot that become blowouts are sometimes completely ignored (except for very brief replays of touchdowns to maintain the promise of showing \\"every touchdown from every game.\\") Likewise a scoreless, or very low scoring game, will not garner much attention either. Furthermore, many fans still prefer to watch complete games. Other complaints include middling games without playoff or draft positioning implications being nearly pushed off the channel in the last weeks of the season, with only cursory glances at highlights, fantasy stats, and scores for those match-ups. Similar channels=DirecTV Red Zone Channel The NFL RedZone channel should not be confused with the nearly identical Red Zone Channel, a service included as part of DirecTV's out-of- market sports package NFL Sunday Ticket, and hosted by Andrew Siciliano. The two red zone channels operate independently of each other but have similar names, identical formats, cover the same games, and will often show the same game live look-ins at the same time. ESPN Goal Line ESPN Goal Line aired live look-ins of college football games in a similar format and style as NFL RedZone. Established in 2010, the channel ceased operations in 2020. SiriusXM's The Sunday Drive Apart from the RedZone channel, a similar service is aired parallel on Sirius XM NFL Radio, hosted by \\"Judge\\" Steve Torre and Bill Lekas. (Zach Gelb fills in when Torre is unavailable.) During the Sunday afternoon games, The Sunday Drive monitors all games in progress across the league. Any time a team enters the red zone, they will cut-in to the team's live local radio broadcast to cover potential scoring action. Until 2014, this audio was also carried on NFL Network during Sunday afternoon games, overlaid with textual scores and stats to avert any form of competition with the league's broadcast partners; in the past it featured more of a \\"carousel\\" type of format where reporters at the game would check in via telephone with the basic score, scoring plays and statistics for the game.  Learfield IMG's College Football Blitz  Similar to The Sunday Drive above, Learfield IMG provides a whip-around radio service for college football that airs on TuneIn and Sirius XM's ESPNU Radio service. Starting in 2015, College Football Blitz airs on Saturdays during college football season from noon to midnight Eastern time, and like The Sunday Drive, cuts into local team broadcasts for possible scoring action. The show is hosted by Stephen Hartzell, with Phil Brame and Adam Witten sometimes taking over for evening hours.

The Premier Drapery Company (PDC) was a major department store in Palmerston North, owned by the Manawatu Co-Operative Society. The mall was developed around the PDC department store in response to the trend away from department stores towards shopping malls. Declining turnover coupled with the 1987 stock market crash saw PDC and the Co-Operative Society go into receivership in 1988, and the mall and department store were sold off. The PDC department store was closed and demolished in 1990 to make way for an extension of the mall. Originally , the mall underwent redevelopment from 2008 to 2010 refurbishing the existing space and expanding to . Redevelopment was done in three stages. The first stage opened in March 2009 with a new food court, a multi-level carpark and 15 new specialty stores. The second stage opened in September 2009 with an additional 10 specialty stores.

M. Jayachandran did the music for this film.http://sify.com/movies/malayalam/review.php?id=14918559&ctid;=5&cid;=2428  Plot  It starts with Prakashan (Jayasurya), narrating his story to Dr. Thomas. He talks about his father, Sreedhara Kurup, who runs a supermarket. Prakashan's father wants him to become an officer but Prakashan's interests lie elsewhere. After graduation, he is more interested in the activities of the village arts club than in looking for a job. He falls for a village girl, Uthara (Roma), who is his childhood friend. But her rich father, Mahadevan, arranges her marriage with another rich boy. The story builds up from here on. Prakashan, who works as a driver in Ponnu's (Uthara's) house, accompanies her to her friend's house. The car breaks down. They stay at a lodge, waiting for a mechanic. During this, a drunk Shaji (Suraj Venjaramood), upset about Ponnu not realising Prakashan's love, calls a policeman to raid the lodge and catch them, so that her marriage gets called off. This happens without Prakashan's knowing. On getting caught and later getting released, Ponnu faces backlash from her greedy relatives and Prakashan from his father. In anger, Ponnu decides that she will only marry Prakashan and not the ones her greedy relatives want her to. Her father and grandmother support this. Prakashan finally marries his dream-girl, but their marriage doesn't last even for a day, when drunk Shaji says that he was the reason for the raid. A misunderstanding in his statement leads everyone to believe that Prakashan also knew about this. Prakashan tries to prove his innocence but his efforts prove to be in vain. His father ousts him out of his house. After a year, Prakashan is finally found in a faraway place. His father requests him to come back as his mother waits for him everyday with a lot of hope and says that he can't break his promise to her. But when they come back, Prakashan's mother had already died of her illness. This leaves everyone devastated. Prakashan, after knowing that Ponnu is getting married, goes to her to bid a final farewell and gives her a bangle, bought with his hard-earned money as her wedding gift, and leaves. Fast forward to 5 years later, Dr. Thomas suggests that Prakashan should meet Ponnu for old times sake, considering that he had saved her from an accident earlier in the day. In the hospital, he finds out that she had been discharged. Finally he reaches, only to find that his father and his sister had been the ones taking care of a depressed Ponnu. His father explains that 5 years back, when he had left, Shaji, while explaining about Prakashan's innocence to Ponnu, got hit by a car and died instantly. After this traumatic experience, she stopped talking, moving and her wedding got called off. Her father died of a broken heart after seeing her condition. Her greedy relatives put her in a mental asylum, from where Prakashan's father found her and looked after her. Finally, all ends well, with Uthara getting cured and starting a new life with Prakashan.  Cast  * Jayasurya as Prakash * Roma as Uthara a.k.a.

It is one of the oldest knifemakers in Japan. Aritsugu was involved in the production of swords and was appointed a supplier for the Imperial House of Japan, before the requirement for new blades diminished due to a more peaceful era emerging through the influence of the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo period in the 17th and 18th centuries. During this period Aritsugu switched its primary production from swords to the pointed knives that were used to carve statues of Buddha. In the late 19th century Meiji period, there was strong growth in demand for kitchen knives and cooking utensils developing in Japan because of stable government and improved living conditions. Aritsugu used its experience in blade production to focus on this emerging market. The current proprietor of Aritsugu is Shinichiro Terakubo, who took over from his father in 1956 when Shinichiro was 17 years of age. He is the 18th generation to be involved in the running of the store since its inception. Shinichiro teaches cooking, knife sharpening and use classes through the store.

Avramidhi was born in Korçë, modern southern Albania, then part of the Ottoman Empire. When he was young he migrated to Bucharest, Romania, where he became a successful businessman.  Life  Avramidhi was born in Korçë and was a member of the local Aromanian community. He moved to Bucharest where he became a successful businessman and planned on awarding his fortune to the inhabitants of his hometown. Thus, he sponsored the foundation and function of several educational, and cultural institutions as well as religious ones. The local Orthodox cathedral of Saint George, was renovated due to his sponsorship. In January 1885 in Romania he became one of the founding members and the president of the Albanian association Drita (), later renamed to Dituria (). He also intended to support the foundation of an Albanian school in Korçë and supported the cause of individuals like Thimi Marko, who was trying to establish Albanian schools. In 1888 he published a book written in Albanian and translated in French, Greek and Romanian titled \\"To Albanians from an Albanian\\". The book dealt primarily with the importance of education in the Albanian language. In his last will he left his fortune to associations promoting Albanian education, but his testament was blocked by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Anastas Avramidhi named as the executor of his last will Orhan Pojani, an activist of the Albanian National Awakening. Although he initially intended to support the foundation of the first Albanian school in Korçë, after discussions with representatives of the Orthodox Church of the city he didn't sponsored this initiative.

Hexis Racing was founded by Michel Mateu, CEO of Hexis S.A. in 2001, initially for participation in the French Formula Renault Championship. Hexis later moved into grand tourer racing in 2005, participating in the FFSA GT Championship before joining the FIA GT3 European Championship in 2007. Hexis Racing has further expanded, now supporting Aston Martin Racing in the 2010 FIA GT1 World Championship season. The team is currently managed by Clément Mateu and Philippe Dumas. History Hexis Racing began as an expansion of Michel Mateu's interests in auto racing, with Mateu using his Hexis brand to help support and finance the team's involvement in the French Formula Renault Championship. Mateu gave the leadership concerns of the team to Philippe Dumas while Clément Mateu held communication and development management. Hexis Racing was able to climb the ranks in Formula Renault and recorded their first race wins in 2003. By the end of 2005 the team had achieved their best placing, third, in the Teams Championship. In the same year, Hexis Racing also expanded their racing effort to include the FFSA GT Championship, choosing to enter a Porsche 996 Cup for Manuel and Julien Rodrigues, later earning second in the category in 2006 after five race victories. Hexis Racing abandoned their involvement in Formula Renault and concentrated their efforts solely on grand tourer racing in 2007, moving to a trio of Aston Martin DBRS9s for not only FFSA GT, but also the FIA GT3 European Championship. Hexis finished third in the FFSA GT Teams Championship while also earning a podium finish in their debut season in FIA GT3. A Hexis Racing Aston Martin DBRS9 participating in an ADAC GT Masters event at the Norisring in 2008 For 2008 Hexis remained in the FIA GT3 series but moved their DBRS9s from FFSA GT to the German ADAC GT Masters series. Their GT Masters effort netted them third in the series' championship while they were runners-up in FIA GT after earning their first series win. Further changes were made for the 2009 season, although the team retained their involvement in FIA GT3. Instead of the GT Masters series, Hexis Racing campaigned a partial season of the FIA GT Championship with a GT2 category Aston Martin V8 Vantage as part of an effort supported by Aston Martin Racing. Although the GT2 effort only came to fruition for two events, the team's GT3 effort saw three race wins and their earning of the Teams Championship title. The team's pairing of Julien Rodrigues and Thomas Accary also earned second in the FIA GT3 Drivers Championship. In 2011, Hexis Racing experienced a hectic season running Aston Martin DBR9s in the FIA GT1 World Championship. The team took a handful of early victories but then struggled to make it to the podium. However, consistent points finishes for both cars and a final podium at the San Luis round allowed Hexis Racing to barely swing past JRM Racing to take the team's championship. The drivers of the #3 car also came in 3rd in the driver's championship. In 2013 Hexis Racing took part in the Blancpain Endurance Series, again with a Mclaren MP4-12C GT3. At the end of the season the team announced its plans to retire from motor racing after the team made it clear earlier in the year it would close its doors if no additional financial backing was secured, after title sponsor Hexis decided to focus its budgets on different matters. Current plans 2010 FIA GT1 World Championship Following the 2011 GT1 season where Hexis took the team's Championship at the very last round, Hexis selected Mclaren MP4-12C GT3s as their car of choice to run in the 2012 GT1 season (due to the mandatory switch to GT3 cars). Stef Dusseldorp returns with Hexis while Frédéric Makowiecki arrives from Marc VDS Racing; there are also GT1 newcomers Grégoire Demoustier and Mclaren factory driver Álvaro Parente.

Boone, David L. Kurtz, page 72 Modes By modeling the swing producer behavior, John Morecroft describes two modes: normal swing mode and punitive mode. Usually in the normal mode, the swing producer responds to market price fluctuations by marginally increasing or decreasing its output in order to maintain stable prices for all producers. However, independent participants can take unjust advantage of the reduced supply and increase their output in order to win a larger market share. In such cases, the swing producer switches to the punitive mode and greatly increases its product output in order to reduce prices, causing losses for other producers and making them cooperate. Swing consumers to nullify the exorbitant pricing power of the swing producers, regulate their consumption or utilize their reserve production capacity or depend on the stocks available to reduce imports till the prices reduce to comfortable level.

The Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab is among the leading research institutes in the field of utilizing Web 2.0 content as the source of lexical semantic information for natural language processing (NLP). Wikipedia and Wiktionary are employed as collaboratively constructed lexical semantic resources and used to improve expert-built resources like WordNet. These resources are used to develop semantically enhanced algorithms for information retrieval and question answering. An example is semantic search: If a user enters the query \\"pie-fruit\\" into a search engine, a standard search engine will retrieve pages containing the words \\"pie\\" but not the word \\"fruit\\", providing plenty of pages on \\"apple pie\\". An intelligent search engine will \\"understand\\" that the user is interested in pie recipes that do not use any type of fruit and retrieve appropriate documents.Example from: Impulse für die Wissenschaft 2010 (Volkswagenstiftung). Further research activities at UKP lab are automatic quality assessment of text, sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Research activities are organized into the following research areas: * Educational natural language processing * Multilingual semantic information management * Natural language processing for Wikis A strong focus at UKP Lab is on utilizing novel natural language processing algorithms in real-life applications. UKP Lab collaborates with partners from academia and industry to improve various application scenarios, such as customer relationship management, digital humanities, educational applications, or public security. Software Part of the research efforts at UKP Lab is the development of natural language processing (NLP) software. The following software packages are freely available for research purposes:  DKPro  The Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Software Repository (DKPro) is an open source community of software projects aimed at Natural Language Processing. It offers robust, ready to use NLP components which are built on top of IBM’s Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) as a common and open framework. DKPro contains basic natural language processing components like part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization. Additionally, the package offers components that support the processing of user generated discourse. User generated content contains spelling errors, abbreviations and emoticons which prohibit direct application of standard NLP components. DKPro provides the required preprocessing tools.

The company, founded in 2008 by two former BBC employees, is now based in Risca, South Wales and produces work for TV, radio and corporate clients. Viral Films= Cow - 2008  \\"Cow\\"\\"Graphic film about dangers of texting is internet hit\\"at Wales-online.co.uk effective due to its highly graphic nature, affected the national debate in the USA about texting and driving. Following rapid viral success, major news outlets like The Today Show and all the national networks began to cover the film's impact. This was followed by worldwide coverage on news networks, online and in print. Furthermore, the film earned honours in the Advertising Age's weekly Creativity Top 5 video. It is now considered the most successful viral Public safety announcement yet experienced on the web. The film began humbly, originally commissioned by Gwent Police to be shown only in schools in the county. Having previously worked with local director Peter Watkins Hughes, they were approached by him to produce and shoot the new project on a modest budget. Zipline's core team, Nathan Mackintosh and Rhys Waters, were previously students on Peter's Documentary Film and Television Degree course, who were still working locally and in the process of setting up their own company. Mackintosh and Waters based themselves in a small unit near Tredegar where they built a large green screen with enough space for a car to be wheeled in front. Alongside this, three identical Ford Kas, two identical Ford Mondeos and two Ford Fiestas were donated to the project by a local car dealer. An abandoned road was chosen to crash the cars in Tafarnaubach Industrial Estate, several miles from the unit. With help from young film makers, local fire fighters and engineers, the team successfully crashed the cars with a multiple camera setup, including a birds-eye view on the impact using a Sony PD170 attached to the bucket of a JCB. The remains of the vehicle were then transported to the green screen unit, and the internal shots of the impact were filmed with the actresses. Nathan, who acted as DOP also was responsible for the special effects on this scene. Over several months he added the additional layers of blood, smoke and glass.  COW's Success  Following the success online and in current affairs outlets, \\"Cow\\" was broadcast on BBC Wales and was then picked up by BBC Three under the banner \\"Only Stwpid COWZ Txt N Drive\\". Television= Rhod Gilbert's Work Experience Series 1 - 2010  Originally commissioned for BBC One Wales and following a successful broadcast, BBC Two decided to broadcast the show on its Wednesday 10 PM slot. The Zipline team worked freelance as producer/directors, editors and also on camera and sound on the series for Presentable RDF. Classed as factual entertainment, the series followed Rhod Gilbert as he tried out jobs he believed to be tougher than being a stand-up comedian. Binman: Gilbert joined the Vale of Glamorgan County Council's waste management team as he walked 10 miles and lifted 20 tons of waste in a day. Mum: Gilbert became Mum to seven children for just 24 hours. This included nappy changes and school runs. Hair Dresser: Afraid of touching other people and having only two days to learn to cut for top stylist Andrew Price, Gilbert had to then cut a real person's hair. Soldier: Gilbert was inserted into a battle hardened platoon, having to hunt an enemy in the British Army's infamous Infantry Battle School.  Rhod Gilbert's Work Experience Series 2 - 2011  Following the success of the first series on both BBC 2 and BBC One Wales, the original team was commissioned to produce another series of four episodes. The decision was made not to alter the format, aside from having mini sketches of Rhod doing his homework before each role. This choice was based on the thought that it was not the format that attracted people, but Rhods interaction with 'real' characters and allowing them their own space to shine on screen. Farmer: City boy Gilbert found himself living with the Robinson family, who run a small organic farm in Llandysul, Carmarthenshire. For three days he lived in the farm house, mucked out the cows, tried (And failed) to work with a trained sheepdog and got given his own special tractor. He was also given the task of being an auctioneer at the local livestock market and had an emotional visit to an abattoir. Butler: Gilbert got trained to be Butler for Sir Brooke Boothby of Fonmon Castle, helping him host a large dinner party for his friends and assisting him clay pigeon shooting. Tattooist: Gilbert was determined to tattoo a real person and along the way ended up getting a tattoo of his own design and his nipple pierced. Based in Abracadabra Studio, Blackwood, South Wales he was mentored by the legendary Dai Fleet. Firefighter: Recruited by South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Gilbert spent three days training, fighting fires and rescuing dummies from freezing rivers.  Rhod Gilbert's Work Experience Series 3 - 2012  The third series was commissioned in late 2011, with Zipline Creative appointed as co-producers as well as producer/directors for the series for the first time. It was shown on BBC One Wales and BBC 2's 10PM comedy slot during winter of 2012. The team decided to try a mix of normal and more eccentric roles for Rhod to attempt, including 'School Teacher' which turned out to be one of the most popular episodes in the show's history. School Teacher: Rhod spend 3 days at Monnow Primary School in Newport. In what turned out to be an emotional experience for Rhod, for the first time on the series he found a job that really grabbed him as a career he would consider. Zoo Keeper: Based at the Welsh Mountain Zoo, Rhod was expected to lead a penguin parade, give a chimp talk and perform with Cousteau a Californian Sealion. Drag Artist: Mentored by Ceri Dupree, legendary Drag Artist. Rhod took on his most challenging role yet and had to completely transform himself to help get into character for his performance. Police Officer: Taken on by South Wales Police, Rhod took part in a drugs raid, helped police a major sporting event and was mauled by a police attack dog.  Rhod Gilbert's Work Experience Series 4 - 2013  A fourth series of Work Experience was commissioned in late 2012, again with Zipline Creative in their permanent role of co-producers of the show alongside Presentable. Most of the filming took place in spring 2013 and the series was broadcast on BBC One Wales in June. It was also broadcast on BBC 2's 10PM slot in August, and repeated on BBC Wales the following year in April 2014. Wedding Planner: Rhod had to put his deep rooted scepticism of weddings and marriage behind him as he took on the challenge of planning a real wedding for a real couple in Miskin Manor, South Wales. Tasked with everything from the wedding cake to engineering the bride's secret wedding day surprise, Rhod was pushed fully out of his comfort zone. Scout Leader: The comedian was challenged with spending a full weekend as a Scout leader on a Scout Camp in Swansea in chilly February. He was given the responsibility of not only taking care of large groups of children, but helping them to learn orienteering, teamwork and survival skills; all while keeping in line with the Scout's strong traditional values. Coach Tour Guide: Hired by popular Welsh coach tour holiday company, Edwards, Rhod was appointed as a tour guide for 30 pensioners on a trip to Belgium. In addition to all the practicalities of planning a trip abroad, he had to organise daytime activities in Antwerp, Bruges and Brussels, and was responsible for the happiness and wellbeing of all holidaymakers throughout the trip. Male Model: This was a unique episode in the series, as modelling is something Rhod had no previous knowledge of or interest in whatsoever. After a number of rejections from top fashion modelling agencies, Rhod explored the alternative areas of modelling, including character modelling and life drawing. He eventually got hired by Welsh fashion designer Julian MacDonald to attend a catwalk show in Merthyr, and managed to secure himself some work as a hand model for a garden centre.  Rhod Gilbert's Work Experience Series 5 - 2014  The fifth series was commissioned in early 2014, and was aired on BBC One in the autumn of 2014. Fisherman Vet Hotelier RAF Fighter Pilot  Gareth Thomas : Game Changer - 2014  A 60-minute profile feature, documenting the life of the popular Welsh international rugby star. Broadcast on 26 October 2014. Radio= Social Club FM - 2012-13  The first radio comedy series produced by Zipline Creative, Social Club FM, was a BBC Radio Wales sitcom based in a Valleys social club, starring Elis James, Chris Corcoran and Nadia Kamil. It ran for two series from 2012-2013 and was very well received critically. It subsequently gained a cult following with prominent comedy enthusiasts and a spin-off TV pilot was produced for BBC Three's Comedy Feeds. The show was written by Elis James (8 Out of Ten Cats, The Committee) and Gareth Gwynn (The News Quiz, The Armstrong And Miller Show) and produced by Sony Award Winning Producer Ben Walker.  Passing On - 2014  Zipline's second radio comedy show, Passing On, was written by Gareth Gwynn and produced by Ben Partridge, and stars Felicity Montagu, Richard Elis, Keiron Self, Katy Wix, Simon Armstrong and Melangell Dolma. The six-part series was broadcast throughout July and August on BBC Radio Wales. The plot follows the story of two very different brothers who are forced to reunite on a monthly basis thanks to an unusual clause in their mother's Will. Concerned that her two sons might drift apart after her death, she testates they meet up once a month to entrust the other with her ashes. They must do this every month without fail until the youngest brother's fortieth birthday.  The Unexplainers - 2015  Open-minded rap star John Rutledge and sceptic stand-up comedian Mike Bubbins travel the nation unexplaining the most unexplainable mysteries. The first four episodes include: 1\\\\. Are we surrounded by ghosts? Mike and John find themselves drenched in ghost energy or ‘Ghenergy’ as they hear accounts from real ghost witnesses and even conduct their own ghost investigation in a haunted pub in Pontypool, South Wales. With the help of some ghost hunting experts, they set up equipment to connect with spirits from the realms beyond science. Will Mike have his paranormal third eye prised open for him to dare to believe? Will John glimpse a full apparition of a ghost? Find out by listening to the evidence.. 2\\\\. Are big cats on the loose in the UK? Mike's aunt once had a big cat, it was black and close to 2% larger than the average household cat. But across the UK, there are rumours of much larger cats, Pumas, Leopards and ferocious cougars living wild a terrorising farmland. With permission from a key eyewitness farmer in North Wales, the Unexplainers set up a big cat watch nerve centre, but will a trap set with offal and, a trail camera reap rewards? 3\\\\. Did an alien spacecraft crash in North Wales? Tabloid press dubbed it the Welsh Roswell, or RosWelsh, but did an alien lose his no claims bonus by smashing into a mountainside in north wales? John's well educated in the ways of Aliens, he's seen at least 3 alien films and scored 10 on a ‘How to tell if you’re an Alien’ quiz on Facebook. Mike and John hit the road north to track down first hand witnesses to extraterrestrial events. When John puts up some posters in the local town of Llandrillo they hit the eyewitness jackpot and find themselves en route to the arguably exact spot where a spaceship possibly did or did not crash. 4\\\\. Do fairies live among us? Despite most people considering fairies to inhabit the realm of make believe, there is a large and growing army of people who claim to see them on a regular basis. John isn't one of their ranks, but he wants to be very badly. Heading out into the ancient British countryside, the duo go in search of a chance encounter, a fleeting glimpse or a full blow package holiday to another realm. Recruiting the help of real witnesses, Iceland's leading Elf ambassador and a reluctant physicist from CERN's Hadron Collider, the hunt is on. The debut episode reached number 10 in the UK podcast charts and it has been considered a hit considering the circumstances of its rapid rise in the charts. Corporate Work Through its corporate wing, Zipline Creative has produced work for the likes of Aston Martin Lagonda, The Institute Of Advanced Broadcast, The University of Wales College, Newport, and worked with legendary actress Margaret John. They also regularly work with local councils and not- for-profit organisations in Wales to produce campaign films and video content.  The Size Of Wales - 2011  Rainforest charity the Size Of Wales, worked with Zipline to produce their second successful viral campaign. Shot and released in October 2011 it aimed to get the people of Wales to donate and help purchase large portions of rainforest for conservation. By mid 2012, donations have topped £1m with the video getting nearly 17,000 hits in 24 hours.  Discover Merthyr Tydfil - 2012  Zipline produced an online promotional film for Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council to feature on the Visit Merthyr website, with the aim of promoting activity tourism in the area. Helicopter footage of the Brecon Beacons area was used in the film to demonstrate the natural beauty of the area, and local people were recruited to take part in the range of outdoor activities featured.  Future Giants - 2013  Zipline's first ever cinema advert was commissioned by Cardiff Sixth Form College to promote the higher education centre to prospective new students. The advert was produced in the style of a Hollywood film trailer, and featured current students at the college walking around the city of Cardiff in the form of giants. Zipline worked together with special effects company Burning Reel and used their onsite green screen studio to create the illusion of real giants in the city.  Time To Change Wales - 2012-14  The Welsh mental health charity have produced a number of projects with Zipline Creative over the last two years. The first of which was 'In the Case of Dylan', a bilingual advert broadcast on ITV and S4C which highlighted the issues people often face when returning to work following leave due to mental illness, and encouraged people to talk about mental health. The advert was re- released in 2013 for cinema broadcast in South Wales. Zipline also produced event coverage films for TTCW in 2013, and a series of animated adverts in 2014 which were broadcast on S4C and nominated for an Inspire Wales Award.  Trades Union Congress animation - 2014  The TUC commissioned Zipline to produce an animated advert to raise the issue of the cost of living crisis affecting young people in the UK. The advert was shared nationally on social media and appeared on an ITV current affairs programme about the campaign. Awards The team won a Welsh BAFTA for their first series of Rhod Gilbert's Work Experience, two Celtic Media Festival Award's for their second and fifth series of the Rhod Gilbert programme, and the Chamber Of Commerce Award for Young Welsh Entrepreneurs of The Year 2009.

The complex dates to at least to the fourth century AD. The site is managed by Heritage Malta and closed to the public for conservation. Structure and features The site comprises three aligned hypogea dug side-by-side, originally accessed via separate stepped shafts but subsequently joined with narrow passages. Although each hypogeum is unique in its internal plan and arrangement, all the hypogea have in common a series of interconnecting galleries and numerous window tombs. Although small compared to other catacombs like St. Paul's in Rabat, the catacombs of Tal-Mintna are highly esteemed for their many interesting features. Window tombs are decorated with elaborately carved scallop-shells and embellished with decorated pilasters. The wall of one small hypogeum features an altar flanked by large pillars carved in relief, on one of which is engraved with illustrations often interpreted to be a face and a kind of palette. Although it is unfinished, the central hypogeum also offers one of the best preserved examples of a triclinium Agape Table to be found in the late-Roman burials of Malta. The table is uniquely equipped with set of eight pyramidal shaped holes that were probably intended to hold lamps. Christian use The window tombs of the Tal-Minta Catacombs bring to mind both Punic and Christian traditions; it is not clear if the burials were originally Christian, or converted to Christian use at a later date. The architectural similarities between late-Punic tombs and Christian hypogea in Malta suggest that the underground burials of early Christians took on Punico- Roman traditions and gave them new significance. Although the agape table, a common feature of early Christian burials, and altar indicate that the place may have at some point been used for Christian burials, no clear Christian iconography survives in any of the three hypogea. The discovery of other hypogea, mostly of Christian orientation, around Mqabba suggests that the area was once the location of a sizeable community. However, very few of these small hypogea survive; the closest burials are located at al Ħal Resqun, Luqa and Ta' Kandja. Although the site was certainly in use sometime around the 4th century AD, the lack of surviving finds makes any clear dating impossible. It is thus likewise impossible to know when the three hypogea fell into disuse. It is also unclear whether the well that was dug through one of the hypogea was placed there intentionally to use the cavities that the hypogea offered or whether it hit upon them accidentally. Certainly, the fact that they were connected to provide more water storage capabilities implies that their location was known. Discovery and excavation The catacombs were discovered in 1860 by Dr Antonio Annetto Caruana and Captain Walter Strickland. At the time the catacombs could only be accessed from a well. The catacombs were surveyed sometime after 1882 and by 1913 three small rooms had been built to cover the entrances. They were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. There is no record of artefacts discovered in the three hypogea. While it is possible that the tombs were despoiled of their material, the clearing of debris, bone and artefacts might also be connected to their Christian transformation.

It was through her strong personality, diplomacy and charm that she saved the house from destruction throughout its occupation by both the Union and Confederate armies during the American Civil War. Background She was the second wife of Claude Vincent de Ternant, 3rd Marquis of Dansville-sur-Meuse, whose grandfather, the first Marquis, had built the plantation house in 1750 on the property obtained by a French land grant. She had three surviving children from this marriage. Through Marie Virginie, her eldest daughter, she was the grandmother of the celebrated Parisian socialite, Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, who was the subject of John Singer Sargent's painting \\"Portrait of Madame X\\". Her second husband was Colonel Charles Parlange from whom her home derived its name. By him she had one son, Charles Parlange. As the Union Army led by General Nathaniel Banks was approaching Parlange, Virginie, by that time a widow and the manager of the plantation, ordered her slaves to bury three chests of treasure estimated at between one third and a half million dollars in gold and silver coins.W.C. Jameson, Buried Treasure of the South: Legends of Lost, Buried and Found Treasure- From Tidewatr Virginia and Coastal Carolina to Cajun Louisiana, p.87, Google Books, retrieved 18 March 2010 One of these chests has never been found. Virginie, who was responsible for Parlange's reputation for elegance by her addition of rich, beautiful furnishings and portraits, is described as \\"the chief personality for Parlange Plantation's greatness\\".Jude Theriot, La Meilleure de la Louisiane: The Best of Louisiana, P.4 Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, better known as \\"Madame X\\", was the granddaughter of Virginie Marriages and children Marie Virginie Trahan was born on August 16, 1818 in St Martinville, Louisiana, the daughter of Leufroy Joseph Trahan (1797-?) and Julie Ardoin (April 12, 1795 – April 8, 1827) who were both white French Créoles. She had two younger sisters, Marie Eriphile and Ameline. She lost her mother when she was eight years old. At the age of 15, she married her second cousin and guardian, Claude Vincent de Ternant, 3rd Marquis of Dansville-sur- Meuse. She was his second wife, with his first marriage to Dorothee Legros having been childless. The marriage between Claude and Virginie produced three surviving children: * Marius Claude de Ternant (1836–1861) * Marie Virginie de Ternant (1837 - 1910), married Anatole Placide Avegno (July 3, 1835 - April 1862), by whom she had children, including Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, better known as \\"Madame X\\". * Julie Eriphile de Ternant (born 1837, died as a young woman) Out of her three children who lived past childhood, only her eldest daughter, Marie Virginie, survived to marry and have children of her own. Virginie's son Marius lived a dissolute life and died at the age of 25, while her youngest daughter Julie was accidentally killed by smashing her head into an oak tree. It was alleged that she was running away from home to escape the planned marriage that her parents had arranged for her. Following her husband's death in 1842, she married a Frenchman, Charles Parlange, who served as a colonel in the French Army. It was he who gave the plantation its name. Together they had one son, Charles (July 23, 1851 – February 4, 1907), who would enjoy a distinguished political career as a state senator, United States Attorney, Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court, and United States federal judge. By his wife, Louise Denis, he was the father of three children. Virginie and her second husband spent much of their married life in New Orleans and Paris. Virginie's home, Parlange Plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana  Parlange Plantation Virginie's first husband, Claude de Ternant, upon inheriting the plantation from his father, switched from growing indigo to sugarcane and cotton. Virginie lavished great care on the decoration of the home, adding opulent furnishings, and many family portraits; through her efforts, Parlange Plantation acquired renown throughout Louisiana for beauty and elegance. A full-length portrait of Virginie was painted in France by Claude-Marie Dubufe. When the American Civil War broke out in April 1861, Virginie, who was widowed for a second time and living in Paris, returned to Louisiana. In 1864, after she had received word that the Union Army was approaching, she hid her furniture, portraits, priceless silver, china, jewelry and clothing. She and her son, Charles placed the Parlange treasure into three large wooden chests; this was estimated to have been between one third and a half million dollars in gold and silver coins. She ordered two of her most trusted black slaves to bury the chests in the garden.Jameson, p.87 When the Union troops led by General Nathaniel Banks arrived at Parlange, she greeted them warmly, inviting the officers to a lavish banquet and allowing the general and his aide to sleep inside the house, while the soldiers were encamped in her formal gardens. The Union Army used her home for their headquarters; and it was through Virginie's tact and charm, which impressed General Banks and his men, that her home was spared destruction. When Confederate General Richard Taylor and his troops later came, she offered them the same warm hospitality. At the end of the war, she retrieved her hidden valuables; only one of the chests containing the coins could not be found. It remains lost to this day. The plantation's fortunes were, however, nearly depleted after the war, and she was compelled to make her own clothing. In 1867, her widowed daughter, Marie Virginie Avegno took her eight-year-old child, Virginie Amélie Avegno to Paris where they ensconced themselves in the highest echelons of Parisian society. The latter eventually became a socialite, married a French banker and shipping magnate; and earned notoriety as the subject of John Singer Sargent's painting, \\"Portrait of Madame X\\". After Virginie's death on November 7, 1887, the plantation house remained empty for 20 years until her grandson Walter Parlange returned to take up the life of a plantation farmer. As of 2014, her direct descendants continue to live at Parlange Plantation.

It was released worldwide on April 20, 2010 as an exclusive title for iOS, but it was later ported to the Android and Windows Phone 7 platforms. Effective May 31, 2016, Square Enix ended distribution of this title, and it is no longer available for download or purchase. Produced by Takehiro Ando, characters were designed by Yusuke Naora, the art director of Final Fantasy VII, VIII, and X among other successful titles. The game takes place in a mysterious place known as Ark Arena, where participants face enemies in both dungeons and tournament-play to avoid death and gain immortality. Chaos Rings features four scenarios. Each scenario is played by two different story characters and across several worlds, ending with a boss battle. A prequel, Chaos Rings Omega, was released on May 19, 2011, and two sequels, Chaos Rings II, released on March 15, 2012, and Chaos Rings III, released on October 16, 2014. Gameplay Chaos Rings begins as a dungeon crawl where navigation and battles are done as a two-person party that is chosen prior to gameplay. Navigation takes place in a third-person perspective. Combat is controlled via a system of menus in a turn-based routine. During a player's turn, there is the option of attempting an escape from the battle, or to fight solo or as a pair. If solo mode is chosen, the player has the ability to choose an individual attack for each member of the party, while pair mode effectively makes the couple a single unit, capable of using each other's moves and having the best attributes of both. However, when in pair mode, both members of the party are open to a hit by a single enemy. In addition to attack, the player also has the ability to perform varied forms of magic known as \\"genes\\", to use items, or to simply defend against an enemy's attack. A special feature in combat is the 'break' feature. Attacks made by the couple will decrease the break gauge if it is red (and thus on the enemies' side), and will increase their own if the attack kills a foe. When the break gauge favors one side, their attacks are more powerful, and the foe's are likewise weakened. Critical hits and abilities like Trompe L'oell have twice the influence of a regular attack on the break gauge. After a successful battle, the duo receives experience points and Ohnz (abbreviated as \\"OZ\\"). Ohnz are the currency in Ark Arena, and can be used to purchase items, weapons, armor, and jewels to be used in combat. Plot=Setting Chaos Rings takes place in a mysterious fictional location known as the Ark Arena that holds many dungeons. Characters begin the game by being automatically transported to the arena with no clear idea of how or why they have arrived there. Dungeons of the Ark Arena consist of mixed indoor and outdoor environments with mid-dungeon and ending boss battles. Characters have the ability to enter and leave dungeons as they please. When not in dungeon-play, characters return to a \\"home\\" area, where health points and magic points are instantly recovered. The Ark Arena is described as an attempt to destroy a being known as the Qualia before it destroys every single time space that the Ark Arena has created by travelling back and forth through time, now for the 2003rd time. It is a place to train chosen couples from different parallel time spaces, eventually joining forces in order to defeat the Qualia. The Ark is designed to return to 10,000 years in the past when a couple is chosen as worthy, to germinate a new, genetically superior race. This process then repeats periodically, theoretically making contestants stronger at each Ark Arena contest, in the hopes to be powerful enough to face the Qualia itself in battle. It is also possible for the Ark to send a couple to the meeting point of the Qualia in another time space, thus making possible the meeting of couples from different time spaces. Characters The game features eight playable characters that were designed by Yusuke Naora. The game originally did not feature voice acting, but a later update added voice acting to key scenes in the game (only in Japanese). The characters consist of five couples: Garrick and Alto, Escher and Musiea, Olgar and Vahti, Eluca and Zhamo, and Ayuta and Mana. Garrick and Alto are not playable, as Garrick dies in the beginning and Alto is killed shortly after (her death varies across the storylines). Each couple has a unique story. ; :Voiced by: Junichi Suwabe :Born into royalty, he was kidnapped by thieves as a young boy. When it was obvious they would not get the ransom they desired for him, they cared for him and taught him their ways. Eventually, he was 'rescued' by knights who brought him back home. However, everyone looked down on him for his past. Unable to live in such circumstances, he left, and using his skills learnt by his adoptive family, became a cleaner for the underworld. On a mission to assassinate a traitor from his organization who had already taken care of the priest and nuns (who were selling children into slavery) from the orphanage where Musiea (Aida) was working. It is after Escher slays the traitor that Musiea walks in and brands him a murderer. Escher is also afflicted by a debilitating disease that manifests itself in hacking coughs. ; / :Voiced by: Marina Inoue :Escher's only childhood friend. She was brought to him, so he could watch over her, as the thieves looked around for someone interested in buying her. She and Escher became good friends. He helps her escape to avoid slavery, promising to find her again one day. Escher receives many beatings for this. She was brought to an orphanage, where her name was changed, and she was raised. She changed her name from Aida to Musiea when she was baptized. ; :Voiced by: Sayaka Ohara :The royal bodyguard and top warrior in a southern kingdom. She was about to behead Zhamo by the order of the 'Divine King' with his family when the sky came to complete darkness. She was envious of Zhamo because of his intelligence and manners, and with the finding that the warrior ring chose Zhamo instead of her. Later on, she makes up her mind to join Zhamo to overthrow the 'Divine King', though she is plagued by thoughts of what she must do if, and when they return to their kingdom, where she will still be under orders to kill him. ; :Voiced by: Hiro Shimono :The prince of a southern kingdom. As he was about to be beheaded for defying the 'Divine King', he saw the light fade away and appeared in the Ark with his executioner, Eluca. He later says that he never hated Eluca, since she was acting as only the tool of the Divine King. His goal is to make a country where poverty does not exist by overthrowing the 'Divine King' once he returns to his world. He initially lacks confidence in himself but later becomes a warrior with the help and encouragement of Eluca and Escher in the Ark Arena. ; :Voiced by: Nobuhiko Okamoto :A stablehand of an eastern kingdom. He is a loyal servant of Princess Mana, with whom he is in love. He states that he thought of her an 'outgoing' person, and got to know her when she was doing archery training, and when she tried to ride a horse. It is revealed later explained in the story that the person Ayuta saw is actually Shea, the Princess' exchanger. His memories are suppressed, and it is with the help of Olgar and Vahti, who have defeated a 'ruthless, demonic' Ayuta in the previous Ark Arena, that they come back. It is then revealed that Ayuta was one of the people who organized the Ark Arena and was participating (with his memories suppressed to make his grisly work easier) in order to prevent the genetic threshold in the Ark Arenas from falling too low. He also reveals that the Ark was never meant to kill. Those who lost were simply to be released back to where they had been with their memories of the Ark suppressed, though they would still succumb to the Qualia shortly after. ; / :Voiced by: Kana Hanazawa :Originally introduced as Princess Mana from an eastern kingdom, her true identity was later revealed as Shea, a body double to the real princess. She was supposed to keep the princess safe until her betrothal. She reveals her identity to Ayuta before the Arena battle against Olgar and Vahti. She is an outgoing person; she practices archery and horseback riding. The first time she meets Ayuta was when she falls from the horse she was riding and was rescued by Ayuta. Ayuta has feelings for Shea, and she, in return, also has feelings for Ayuta. She is secretly jealous because Ayuta still seems to have feelings for Theia, the original First Woman, whose consciousness has become the driving force behind the Ark 'In lieu of AI'. In the end, Ayuta chooses to live in Shea's world and Shea, in return, promises to Theia that if they ever have a daughter, it will be named after her. Theia gives them her blessing, and then finally dies after eons of time travel. It is unclear whether or not the Princess Manas in the other three time spaces are the true princess, or still one of her body doubles. During Olgar's story, it is revealed she has an incredibly powerful ability: to transform her own life force into a devastating arrow attack, which she used to obliterate the Executioner easily. ; :Voiced by: Unsho Ishizuka :The first to ever make it into two consecutive Ark Arenas, he is shown to be a brutal foe in combat, and coarse in speech. In his first Ark Arena, he killed his fiancee's own parents in combat (Chaos Rings Omega reveals the context, however). As his second Ark trip continues, he realizes what it is like to fight his own children, or rather, extremely removed descendants, who remember him and Vahti in myths, changing him for the better, though perhaps not for the best of the world. He chooses his first love, Vahti, over a look-alike with Theia's vastly superior, potentially world- saving genes, simply for his love, smashing down an eons-old and likewise skilled Ayuta to do so. He is also revealed to be the very first Divine King of Eluca and Zhamo's realm, from which came a myth of two saddened giants roaming the earth, creating mankind from their tears. The Agent in his plot line is different in that it absorbs subjects to gain their abilities, doing so with Theia's clone in his first fight, and with Princess Mana for her life force channeling abilities in the second battle. There appears to be no difference in the actual fights, however. ; :Voiced by: Ayano Niina :Though her husband is introduced as a juggernaut of war, Vahti shows so much sympathy with the other combatants that it is 'almost' like she's their own mother. Except for Ayuta, this is quite truthful. At some point before the third dungeon, she is kidnapped by Ayuta, placed into a cold sleep, and replaced with Theia's last clone, altered to have her exact memories, personality, appearance, and abilities. Olgar fights through the final dungeon alone in order to get her back, even though, according to Ayuta, his superior genes, along with Theia's, would be most certainly able to spawn a human race capable of defeating the Qualia. Later, after sustaining fatal wounds from the Executioner, she collapses against the might of the Agent, even as Olgar smashes him flat. As Olgar grieves, Mana manages to transfer what was left of her life force after using it to defeat the Executioner, once, to Vahti, preserving her life at the cost of Ayuta's and her own. Story In Chaos Rings four couples compete in the ominously named Ark Arena (one extra pair, Garrick and Alto, voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki and Asami Seto respectively, are eliminated early on in all four storylines and cannot be selected for play). In the beginning, Garrick attempts to attack the Agent, the apparent director of the Arena's events. The Agent states that those who do not follow the rules shall be killed, and a grim reaper-like monster comes and his body dissipates in a cloud of purple mist. The Agent also says that immortality and eternal youth await the champions of the Ark Arena. He then allows the remaining couples to enter a door, and find the first ring, the Warrior's ring required to fight in the Ark Arena. When the couples come back, they are sent out once again to gather the other required ring, the Companion's Ring. When the first round of battles begins, the couple the player is playing as will always have to win. Once the couple wins, they are sent to find proof of why they have been selected to fight in the Ark together, after which they must fight other humans once again. After the final battle is won, the couple will have to call the Agent to speak to him. He says that the couple must fight him to become immortal. After he is defeated, he says something to 'the Almighty' regarding their incredible power. The couple will appear back in the main room where the dungeon door now has an option named 'Original Door'. If Original Door is chosen, the player will see a cutscene where the characters appear on Earth 10,000 years ago. They have been chosen because of their superior DNA to start a new human race strong enough to defeat a monstrous being called the Qualia. They are granted immortality and eternal youth. It is also shown that the Ark Arena is a floating ship that travels through time. If the player saves after the credits and reloads the game, the dungeon door will have a new option named 'Bereshith Road' where a whole new story unwinds. The grim reaper-like creature is revealed to be the Executioner (though its name is revealed earlier in the Ayuta-Mana/Shea route), and his purpose is to remove insubordinate or defeated competitors in the Ark Arena. He must be fought and killed. Next, the players enter a room where documents explaining the Ark Arena, the Agent, and the Executioner are held. It is learned that both the Executioner and the Agent are artificial organisms that are programmed to ensure the smooth running of the Ark Arena. Soon afterwards, they stumble upon the terrible Arena itself. Later, they find the Agent, who is to test them once more. This time he is called the 'True Agent' and is much more powerful, attacking twice per turn, one of the few foes who can. Once he is defeated, the couple learns of a 'Final Door' that leads to the Qualia. They go up another level (Bereshith Road is actually a moving platform that goes up to higher levels, where more and more powerful beings are held), to find yet another powerful being, the Almighty. The Almighty is the creator of the Ark Arena and the operator of it. It is a woman's body that extends from the floor, appearing to be part of the Ark itself. If she is defeated, then the couple arrives at the top floor, and a glowing red vortex awaits their arrival. As they enter it, the chosen couple comes across with the other three couples they thought had been defeated in the past arena battles. It is later then explained by Ayuta, who has recovered his original memories, that each of their story is true, since the people they were forced to kill were of different timespaces. They then encounter the Qualia, which envelops the Earth almost immediately. They are staggered by its sheer power, but then regain their strength and composure and go on to defeat the Qualia. The Qualia is defeated, but more Qualia emerge from the parallel timespaces that they have destroyed. With their limited strength, the four couples once again lose hope, until Theia tells them to see the miracle they created for their resistance to destruction. With a burst of light, hundreds of starships, supposedly manned by the parallel timespace's denizens, appears and completely annihilate the Qualia. With Theia's last strength, she sends the couples back to the dimensional time and space of their choice. The couples choose to return to the period before they were summoned to the Ark. Finally, Theia issues the command to shut down the ancient Ark, finally terminating the endless timespace-generating spiral. Music Noriyasu Agematsu, of the musical group Elements Garden, composed all the music to Chaos Rings. Following the release of the game, Square Enix released the Chaos Rings Original Soundtrack for digital download on June 23, 2010 via the iTunes Store. According to one of the game's assistant producers, Hiroaki Iwano, the soundtrack was released primarily due to popular demand. ReceptionSequel and prequel Square Enix has published two more games in the Chaos Rings series to date. A trailer of the prequel entitled Chaos Rings Omega, has since been released. Chaos Rings Omega was released on May 19, 2011 in North America and the next day in Japan. Omega has many similarities to the first game. The gameplay and navigation are still the same, while the setting is slightly changed on its layout. The game stars a mostly new set of characters, though the first game's Olgar (with a different name), Vahti, and Ayuta are all playable as well. The storyline features twists not seen in the first game, said twists sending the plot off in a completely different direction than before. On May 20, 2011, a teaser trailer for Chaos Rings II was released.

Rental system  Online book-rental services save time by delivering books to a member's home or office. In addition to convenience, the service also offers an ease-of-use benefit; membership on most websites involves a simple registration form and payment through bank transfer or cash on delivery. This is important in a market that does not yet trust internet-based monetary transactions. Once membership is paid the user logs in to browse books, and clicks the \\"rent\\" button to receive the chosen books at home. The books are collected when the user logs in to indicate that he or she has finished reading. Another advantage of online rental services is that most do not have any due dates or late fees; borrowers may keep books for as long as they wish, provided they pay the regular subscription. This era is changing, edits being made with education book selling. Engineering books are often taken on rent for a semester or 2 and returned after use. With the online space roaring, newer start ups have emerged in online book renting. In engineering book stores, you order books and pay Cash on Delivery, after usage you collect back up to 70% of the invoice back.  Presence  Online libraries and rental companies have come with a national presence and are trying to reach other smaller cities by using courier companies and the postal service to deliver books. These new ventures have become popular with the trend towards internet-based marketing; almost all have their own blogs and Facebook pages. Ventures like Pustakkosh, Justbooks are major national level players in Indian online book rental scenario.  Electronic versus print books  There is speculation as to the survival of these ventures, as more people use Amazon Kindle and read books online. However, most book-lovers prefer a physical book, and this is the premise on which these new ventures are based. Their success remains to be seen; however, they offer a ray of hope for young professionals in the country who currently lack access to books. Apart from the metropolitan areas, most cities and towns in India do not have good, well-stocked public libraries. For the residents of these cities, such ventures may offer an economical way to bridge the gap.

Almost 4,000 were produced, mostly in service with the RAF between 1944 and 1965. Meteors also served with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), whose aircraft saw action in the Korean War; other users included the Argentinian, Brazilian, Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Ecuadorian, French and Israeli air forces.

Meteor F.4 C-041 at the Museo Nacional de Aeronáutica, Buenos Aires in 2006 The first export order for Meteors came from Argentina, which received 100 F.4s. The first 50 were ex-RAF, the second 50 new. The Fuerza Aérea Argentina (FAA) identified aircraft with a number which remained the same throughout the life of the airframe, preceded by a letter indicating the role. From purchase in the late 1940s to about 1963 the Meteors were used as interceptors, letter I, and hence serialled e.g. I-025. After that, they were deployed as fighter bombers, letter C, and the same aircraft exampled before became C-025.

The catacombs open on to a low ridge facing a now lost Roman harbour, making the small site archaeologically important. The site is managed by Heritage Malta and is closed to the public for conservation. Description A window tomb in the Salina Catacombs The site comprises five hypogea cut into the vertical surface of a small quarry. A number of other openings can be seen in rocky outcrops around the site and at least one hypogeum has been damaged by further quarrying, resulting in the destruction of a number of burials. The most impressive hypogeum is adorned with two decorated pillars, an agape table and two baldacchino tombs, rarely found outside the catacombs of Rabat. The window tombs that surround the agape table suggest that it was an important feature of the catacomb. At least two of the window tombs are lavishly decorated with reliefs depicting palm fronds and other spiraled patterns. The palm fronds, together with a number of incised crosses, are proof of the Christian origins of the burial site.

The film tells about a group of people travelling by car to the airport, when along the road, they meet a beautiful woman named Maya who says she has been robbed and needs a ride home. The film is based on the short film Dara. Before the film was screened in Indonesia, it was screened at several festivals in 2009. Rumah Dara then received a wide release in Indonesia on January 22, 2010. The movie has been planned for distribution in North America and Europe by Overlook Entertainment. The film was released on VOD platforms in 2013 as part of the Bloody Disgusting Selects line. According to the official Twitter page for Rumah Dara, the film is banned in Malaysia because of excessive violence. The movie is the first Indonesian film to be banned there. The story unfolds as the group of travelers attempts to escape from a house which is owned by a mysterious lady named Dara and her family. The group is attacked with several types of weapons. Plot Adjie and Astrid, a married couple, are getting ready to travel to Sydney for a new job. They are accompanied by their friends, Alam, Eko, and Jimmy to the airport. On the road, they meet up with Adjie's sister, Ladya, and convince her to go with them. Ladya, who still blames Adjie for their parent's death, declines but later changes her mind. After they drive from Ladya's workplace, they see a confused beautiful woman named Maya on the road. She tells them she has been robbed and is unable to get home. Pitying her, they give Maya a ride home. The group drives to what seems to be the middle of nowhere, where Maya's house is located. There, they meet Maya's family. Her mother, Dara, has a very young and lovely face with an eerie expression and mysterious body language. Adam, Maya's brother is very gentlemanly. Arman, Dara's eldest son, is grumpy and never speaks. Dara secretly drugs Astrid's drink. After much insistence, the group agrees to stay for dinner. Adjie and Astrid, who is pregnant, go upstairs so Astrid could rest. Unfortunately, the remainder of their friends at the dinner get drugged and knocked out. Arman takes them to a cellar, with Alam still at the dinner table. Alam is seduced by Maya, but rejects her. Out of anger, she slashes him and Adam breaks his arm. Adjie and Astrid see this and try to escape upstairs, but Adam breaks Adjie's leg. Astrid locks herself in the guest room. Dara tells her that the drug she was given will cause her to go into labor. Astrid finds a small window and sees a car arriving at the house. She calls for help, but the woman from the car is Dara's friend. She is given several coolers of \\"meat\\", revealing the motive for the slaughter to come. They are a family of cannibals, who belong to a secret society attempting to gain immortality from it. They regularly search for victims, providing human flesh for the society. Astrid's water breaks, and she gives birth on her own. Astrid gets out of the room with her newborn son and embraces her husband. Dara sneaks in and takes the baby. She tells the couple they can escape by themselves but if they try to take the infant back, they will all die. Astrid follows Dara as Adjie looks for help. Down in the cellar, Arman has slaughtered Alam with a chainsaw. Ladya knocks him out and breaks out of the cellar. She sets Eko and Jimmy free. After their escape, the trio re-enter the house in an attempt to save the married couple. Maya, armed with a crossbow, shoots at Eko, hitting his left ear. They run to the forest, with Adam now chasing them. Ladya gets away and goes back to the house. Adam catches Jimmy and snaps his neck, killing him. Eko finds a road, where he is spotted by the light of a car. Back in the house, Adjie enters a room filled with baby cadavers and sees one baby being preserved. He then finds Astrid dead, having been stabbed in the neck with a large hair pin. Adjie attempts to strangle Dara in revenge but Dara stabs him and strangles him into unconsciousness. Arman captures Ladya and prepares to rape her. The car Eko saw is revealed to be a police patrol car. They find Eko and arrive at the house. The four police officers search the house; one of them finds a video containing the clip that was seen at the start of the film. Shocked, he accidentally drops a collection of photographs, depicting Adam, Arman, and Maya, strangely dated 1912. A photo of Dara is dated 1889. Upstairs, Arman is stabbed in the eye while raping Ladya. She escapes while Arman screams, tipping off the police. Adam turns off the lights, and the family of cannibals attack the police in the dark. However, the leader gets away and fires his assault rifle at Maya, fatally wounding her. Dara, who has killed the other officers, fights the leader for the gun and shoots him to death. Dara finds the dying Maya and breaks her neck to end her daughter's suffering. Arman comes out with a wooden stick jammed in his eye. He slashes the throat of one of the officers and they die together. Ladya runs to where Adjie is, and they are attacked by Adam. Eko enters and jabs Adam with a sword. Adjie pours a liquid over his head and uses Ladya's lighter to set Adam on fire. Eko is slashed by Dara with a chainsaw while Ladya and Adjie attack a severely burnt Adam. Together, they decapitate Adam. Ladya and Adjie take the baby to another part of the house. Ladya takes revenge on Dara, the last cannibal remaining. She finds Eko's body and is attacked by Dara and her chainsaw. Ladya fights her with a sword. Dara slashes Adjie's shoulder. Ladya, using one of the officers' guns, shoots Dara, then strangles her with her necklace. She reunites with Adjie and apologizes to him. Adjie forgives her and dies after he asks Ladya to care of her nephew (his newborn son). Morning has come as Ladya leaves the house with her nephew. She starts the car, but Dara reappears, still alive, and attacks Ladya. Ladya drives and smashes Dara against a large tree. She then looks at Dara's fallen body and drives away. Dara's bloody hand is seen twitching slightly. Cast * Julie Estelle as Ladya. Estelle at first refused to act in this film, but once she saw the script she became interested.

Saint- Estèphe is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for red wine in the Bordeaux region, located in the Médoc subregion. It takes its name from the commune of Saint-Estèphe and is the northernmost of the six communal appellations in Médoc. Five classified growths of 1855 (Bordeaux Grands Crus Classés en 1855) are located within the appellation area. Saint-Estèphe has held AOC recognition since 1936. Historical background Vines were already being cultivated on the land around Saint-Estèphe in Roman times.Page of AOC Saint-Estèphe on the website medoc-bordeaux.com, accessed 30 January 2010. In the Middle Ages the wine business expanded, thanks to English buyers who regularly came to the port of Bordeaux for their wine. The draining of marshland, which began in the 17th century, made larger areas of land available for cultivation.Histoire du Médoc on the website medoc-bordeaux.com, accessed 30 January 2010.  Location = Geographical area  This designation can only be used to denote wines produced in a clearly defined area, corresponding to the commune (or municipality) of Saint-Estèphe.  Geology and orography  The sol de grave (a soil type containing a mixture of gravels, clay and sand), shared by all AOC wines from the Médoc, contains a slightly higher proportion of clay in this particular area.  Climate  The Saint-Estèphe vineyards enjoy the same weather conditions as the Bordeaux- Mérignac meteorological station. The local climate is, however, affected by the nearby River Garonne. It has the effect of making it more temperate. Vineyards= Grape varieties grown  Clusters of ripe Cabernet Sauvignon. The varieties recommended for this appellation are Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Carménère, Côt and Petit VerdotDatasheet for AOC Saint-Estèphe on the website legifrance.gouv.fr, accessed on 15 January 2010. The AOC regulations do not stipulate the exact proportions to be combined, but in practice most blends consist predominantly of Cabernet Sauvignon. The proportions according to which the six varieties are combined give the wines from each château or estate their own distinctive personality. While some châteaux increase the proportion of Merlot in order to make their young wines easier on the palate, others continue to grow a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon. The châteaux of Cos d'Estournel,Château Cos d'Estournel on the website estournel.com, accessed 31 January 2010. Lilian LadouysSection vin on the website chateaulilianladouys.com, accessed 31 January 2010. and Meyney,Section présentation, le vin on the website meyney.fr, accessed 31 January 2010. for example, use 60% or more of the latter variety. Methods of cultivation The density of planting required is at least 7,000 vines per hectare. The rows should be positioned no more than 1.5 metres apart and the distance between any two vines within a row should not be less than 0.8 metres. The vines are pruned every year before the first leaves have opened fully. The aim is to keep a maximum of 12 renewal buds per vine (each renewal bud will produce a side branch bearing a cluster of grapes). Authorized pruning methods include the so-called \\"médocaine\\" method (the local name for Guyot pruning), with either cane pruning or cane and spur pruning, and the so- called \\"à cots\\" method (spur pruning), based on the methods traditionally called Cordon de Royat (unilateral cordon) or éventail (fan). For vines planted less than 1.4 metres apart, the height of the foliage must be at least 0.6 times the distance between rows, while for vines planted between 1.4 and 1.5 metres apart, the height should be increased to at least 0.7 times the distance between rows. This rule is designed to ensure the growth of sufficient foliage for the grapes to ripen well.  Harvesting  By law the yield per plot is restricted to 9,500 kg per hectare, which is the equivalent of 14 bunches per vine for Petit Verdot grapes and 12 bunches per vine for other varieties. This quantity should (only) give a yield per hectare of 57 hectolitres (per hectare) once the process of wine-making has been completed. The harvesting method is not stipulated in the AOC regulations. In fact many estates now use harvesting machines, although some prestigious estates, such as the châteaux of Lilian Ladouys and Meyney, still harvest by hand. This practice is defended on the basis that it is possible to sort at the same time as harvesting, not to mention the further round of sorting that takes place when the harvest is loaded onto a sorting table in the wine shed.  Wine- making  On arrival in the chai, the grapes are destemmed and crushed before being transferred to non-oxidizing concrete or wooden tanks. The maceration of grape skins mixed with grape must begins. Alcoholic fermentation is activated using selected commercial yeasts or yeasts that are naturally present in the bloom on the skins of the grapes. The wine sheds are equipped with temperature-controlled tanks, making it possible to direct the fermentation process by preventing temperatures from rising too high and then, at the very end, reheating the harvested materials. This procedure is designed to maintain an environment in which the yeasts can efficiently transform the sugar into alcohol, and the colour (anthocyanins) and tannins can best be extracted. Fermentation is a long process, lasting between two and four weeks, depending on the estate and varying from year to year. Once the wine has been drained off, the grape residue is pressed. The pressed wine is tasted. Based on the outcome of this test of taste and smell, which takes into account grape variety and vintage, a decision is made as to whether or not the press wine is good enough to be included in the final blend. The next step is to store the wine in a tank (or sometimes in a barrel) at a temperature situated between 20 and 25 °C, which allows malolactic fermentation to take place. At this stage the quality of each tank is assessed individually before small amounts from each batch are combined in test conditions. This sample blend then serves as a yardstick for the blends about to be created, each estate preserving the distinctive character of its own wines while reflecting the overall style of that particular vintage. This process, which is carried out by the wine-maker and an oenologist, is crucial to the end result. Once the wines have been blended on a large scale, they are matured in tanks (in the case of smoother vintages) or in barrels (in the case of more robust vintages). Maturing a wine means storing it for long periods in cellars where the temperature is controlled and where it remains undisturbed apart from rackings that take place every three months. Maturing a wine that is stored in barrels can take between six and eighteen months.  Wine = Analytical criteria  The minimum alcohol content is set at 11% by volume. When it is decided that a wine needs enriching, the alcohol content should not exceed 13.5% by volume. When the harvest is of such exceptional quality that it does not need enriching at all, there is no upper limit to the naturally occurring alcohol content allowed. In the case of batches of wine produced for the commercial market, the process of alcoholic fermentation must be halted (less than two grams per litre of fermentable sugar) and malolactic fermentation carried out. (less than 0.30 grams per litre of malic acid). The volatile acidity of the wine must not exceed 13.26 milliequivalents (i.e. 0.79 expressed as grams per litre of acetic acid or 0.65 g/L of H2SO4) in the first year of aging (up to 31 July). After that the limit is set at 16.33 mEq. (i.e. 0.98 expressed as grams per litre of acetic acid or 0.80 g/L of H2SO4).  Tasting  Considerable variations in terroir (the soil, weather conditions and wine- making traditions associated with a particular vineyard) mean that the wines produced differ according to the estates from which they originate. Nevertheless, they all share certain typical characteristics. The authoritative French wine guide published by Hachette, refers to Saint-Estèphe wines as having a finer acidity, tannic structure and colour than other Médoc wines. With maturity this wine acquires stronger fruit flavours and becomes more rounded and elegant. It is definitely a wine that improves with age, and can be kept for some considerable time. In his book Bordeaux, Robert M. Parker Jr. states that the wines of Saint-Estèphe \\"have the reputation of being the slowest to mature, and the toughest, most tannic wines.\\" Matching food and wine Saint-Estèphe complements red meats particularly well. In his book, L'École des alliances, les mets et les vins (A Course in Match-making, Food and Wine), Pierre Casamayor writes, \\"red meats have one essential quality, which is that their proteins render even the most virile tannins attractive.\\"L'école des alliances, les mets et les vins, Hachette pratique, octobre 2000, , page 179. Thanks to its powerful structure, Saint-Estèphe is a match for red meats such as roast rib of beefGuide hachette des vins 2010, page 382 or agneau de Pauillac à la cuisson de sept heuresChâteau Phélan Ségur on the website phelansegur.com (local Pauillac lamb cooked for seven hours according to a traditional recipe) or, once it has aged, for a truffle sauce or for furred game meats cooked in a marinade or when aged, with game.  Production  The Saint-Estèphe vineyards cover , and in 2008 they produced 54,200 hectolitres of wine. This volume of wine represents on average 8.7 million bottles per year. The wine is produced by 136 different producers: 80 of them are members of cooperatives and 56 are private estates. Classified Saint-Estèphe estates In the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, there are no First Growths in Saint-Estèphe, but two Second Growths. The classified estates of Saint-Estèphe are: *Second Growths **Château Cos d'Estournel **Château Montrose *Third Growths **Château Calon-Ségur *Fourth Growths **Château Lafon-Rochet *Fifth Growths **Château Cos Labory Saint- Estèphe also has the distinction of having produced a large number of other wines (Cru Bourgeois or non-classified) that are nevertheless of excellent quality, some of them being comparable to or better than some of the Grand Cru Classé wines. Château Phélan Ségur, Château Les Ormes de Pez, and Château Haut-Marbuzet are just a few such wines.

The AOC status was awarded by a decree of December 24, 1939 (modified by the decree of August 29, 2002). The wine-growing area extends over departments of Indre-et-Loire, Indre and Loir-et-Cher and comprises a total of 70 communes and it is thus a \\"subregional\\" appellation covering the same area as a number of local AOCs. Grape varieties The white wines are made from Chenin blanc grapes (known locally as Pineau Blanc de la Loire), and from Sauvignon blanc and Arbois grapes. The white Touraine wines are dry, fairly firm, lively and full, and keep well when bottled. The sparkling wines are allowed to use the designation \\"Touraine mousse\\" (sparkling Touraine wine). Up to 20% of Chardonnay grapes may be included in the mixture of varieties grown. The red wines are produced from Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Côt, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier, Pinot gris, Pineau d'Aunis and Gamay grape varieties (Gamay is used only for wines marketed in the first year after production). These wines are flavoursome and tannic in character. Touraine wines sold in the first year of production are light and fruity, as well as rustic. The rosé wines are made from Cabernet Franc, Sauvignon, Côt, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier, Pinot gris, Pineau d'Aunis, Gamay and Grolleau grape varieties. These wines are dry in character. Appellations and designation The best known designations within Touraine AOC, and separate appellations in this subregion, are: * Touraine: this is the appellation known simply as \\"Touraine\\" and covering the entire subregion. Its land borders the Loire river, stretching from the Sologne region to the borders of Vienne and Anjou. The wine officially designated \\"Touraine primeur \\" (Touraine wine marketed in the first year after production) is made exclusively from the Gamay noir à Jus blanc grape variety. * Touraine-Amboise: this appellation covers ten communes located on the outskirts of Amboise. The red and rosé wines are produced from the grape varieties, Cabernet Franc (known locally as \\"Breton\\"), Cabernet Sauvignon, Côt and Gamay noir, while the white wines (dry, medium-dry and medium-sweet) are made from Chenin blanc (known locally as Pineau de la Loire). * Touraine Mesland: the small village of Mesland, which lies between Amboise and Blois, gives its name to red, rosé and white wines of considerable finesse produced from Gamay grapes, and to white wines produced from Chenin grapes. * Touraine Azay-le-Rideau: located in the wine-growing area surrounding the Château of Azay-le-Rideau, this village gives its name to white wines produced from Chenin grapesINAO page on Touraine Azay-le-Rideau Blanc and to rosé wines produced from Chenin, Gamay and Grolleau grapes.INAO page on Touraine Azay-le- Rideau Rosé * Bourgueil: lying to the north of the Loire river, between Chinon and Saumur, the Bourgueil region is one of the largest wine-growing areas of Touraine. This is the Cabernet Franc country, the region straddles the Touraine and Anjou regions. Depending on the nature of the soil, two different kinds of wine grow alongside each other within the Bourgueil appellation area. Wines from fine gravel soils, must be drunk when very young, while wines from calcareous tuffeau soils develop their flavours and aromas a year later. Bourgueil wines age well for a very long time. * Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil: very close to the Bourgueil wine-growing area in terms of distance, but a world away in terms of its wines, is the village of Saint-Nicolas-de- Bourgueil. The wines produced here are of exceptional quality and their reputation extends far beyond France. These wines, which have very strong red fruit flavours, can be drunk in their first year, but improve with every passing year and can be kept very successfully for more than ten years. * Chinon: these wines are often better known than the Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil wines (perhaps because the village itself is so well known), and are less fruity. The wines of Chinon are indissolubly linked to the literary output of Rabelais (a famous French Renaissance writer), the most famous person to have sung their praises. * Vouvray: another great name with an international reputation, dating from the time of Saint Martin of Tours himself, who is thought to have initiated wine-growing in this area. Balzac (a famous 19th century French novelist) pays tribute to this wine in his writing. Lying to the east of Tours and situated on the right bank of the Loire, the Vouvray region produces white wines only. Some Vouvray wines are semi-sparkling or sparkling. In a cellar with good storage conditions, Vouvray wines can be kept for 40 years. In Touraine, in fact, it is not uncommon for Vouvray to replace Champagne at meals marking special occasions. * Montlouis: located only a few kilometres to the east of Tours, Montlouis-sur-Loire gives its name to white wines that are less well known outside of the Touraine region and are all made from Chenin Blanc grapes. The Montlouis-sur-Loire (or \\"Montlouis\\") wine- growing area was originally part of the Vouvray region, but lay on the left bank of the Loire on somewhat different soil. It was in 1938 that Montlouis- sur-Loire became an AOC (quality-controlled designation of origin) wine with an appellation that was independent from that of Vouvray. In parallel with the Vouvray wines, some Montlouis wines are semi-sparkling or sparkling, and in 2007 the term was added to distinguish sparkling wines made in the (ancestral method) style.

It is located within the Entre-Deux-Mers subregion of Bordeaux. It takes its name from the town of Cadillac. In 2008, the area under cultivation was , producing 6,000 hectolitres of wine. History The history of wine-growing in the Cadillac area parallels that of the wider Bordeaux wine growing region. Situated within the Premières Côtes de Bordeaux AOC,Fiche de l'AOC Cadillac at premierescotesdebordeaux.com, accessed January 10, 2010. Cadillac has been a separate AOC since August 10, 1973.Cahier des charges de l'appellation cadillac at legifrance.gouv.fr, accessed January 10, 2010. Location and climate Location of the Cadillac AOC (#30) in relation to other wine districts of Bordeaux including Graves(#34), Pessac-Léognan (#33), Sauternes (#37), Barsac (#36) and Entre- Deux-Mers (#25). Cadillac is a small town tucked between the right bank of the Garonne and the calcareous cliffs of the Entre-Deux-Mers plateau, and is about thirty kilometres from Bordeaux. The appellation area includes the communes of Baurech, Beguey, Cadillac, Capian, Cardan, Donzac, Tabanac, Le Tourne, Verdelais and Villenave-de-Rions. The Cadillac region enjoys the same moderate oceanic climate as the Mérignac meteorological station. The proximity of the Garonne, which runs immediately beneath the wine-growing area, creates a local micro-climate. In autumn the river gives rise to early morning humidity, which gradually dries up in the course of the day, conditions that are particularly conducive to the development of moulds that eventually turn into noble rot. Grape varieties The appellation area is planted with traditional Bordeaux grape varieties. Sémillon covers 70% of the area. A grape variety with potentially high concentrations of sugar, it has a thin skin which allows the Botrytis cinerea fungus to develop and produce noble rot. The 20% of Sauvignon blanc and Sauvignon gris grapes used add a touch of liveliness to the wine, while the 10% of Muscadelle add a touch of added complexity. Viticulture Semillon infected with botrytis. The density of planting required is at least 4,500 vines per hectare. The distance between rows should be 2.50 metres at most, and the distance between individual vines within the row should be at least 0.85 metres. Pruning of vines should take place annually, before the first leaves have fully developed. Single and Double Guyot, Cordon de Royat (unilateral cordon), Eventail (Fan) and Gobelet (Goblet) are the permitted pruning methods. The number of buds (that will eventually bear clusters) is limited to a maximum of 12. Once suckering and green harvesting have been completed, the maximum number of clusters allowed per vine is 14. Plots that have been abandoned can no longer be considered part of the AOC area. Wine- growers must mow or use herbicides to prevent weeds from growing up around the vines, otherwise they could create a humid micro-climate below the leaves that would encourage the development of cryptogamic diseases. They must also carry out treatments to keep the occurrence of diseases such as mildew and oidium below the permitted quality thresholds. The proportion of dead or missing vines may not exceed 20% of the total number. If this percentage is exceeded, the final yield must be cut down proportionately. Harvesting Harvesting is carried out when the grapes are fully ripe. The degree of ripeness is ascertained by the presence of noble rot or signs of over-maturity, i.e. grapes have begun to dry out on the vine and have become shrivelled, golden- coloured berries. It can also be assessed by measuring the sugar content. Before harvesting can begin, it must be shown that the grapes contain at least 255 grams of sugar per litre. Harvesting is carried out manually over multiple successive pickings combined with sorting of the grapes. The grape-pickers are ordered to pick only those clusters or part-clusters which are either fully ripe or have heightened sugar content brought about by noble rot. This means that the use of harvesting machines is automatically precluded. Winemaking Sauvignon blanc grapes. Once they arrive in the wine sheds, the grapes are pressed. The process is carried out slowly in order to allow enough time for the must to be extracted from the virtually dried-out fruits. Even so, yields of juice are low. The use of machines which completely break down the grapes is prohibited, i.e. self-emptying tanks with combined rotor crushers and must pumps, continuous screw presses and small diameter screw presses. The must is placed in tanks and cooled ready for racking. Afterwards, the must is left to ferment, either in vats or in barrels. The fermentation process is lengthy, since the sugar and alcohol slow down the activity of the yeast. Fermentation either stops naturally or is stopped by the wine-grower using cooling and sterile filtering processes: this kind of filtering uses a very fine mesh to capture the yeasts that have been anesthetized by the cold. At this stage, the wine is stabilized against possible yeast or bacterial contamination by the addition of sulfites. The wine is left to mature in vats or barrels for several months and is not allowed to leave the wine sheds before 31 March of the year following the harvest. Quarterly rackings ensure that the lees held in suspension in the wine are gradually removed. Before being bottled, the wine is filtered and the sulfite level is adjusted. Wine styles and AOC regulations A bottle of Cadillac: Chateau Fayau, 1996 The wine has a golden yellow colour that slowly develops over time to a shade of amber. Aromas are generally fruity (apricot, citrus), floral (honeysuckle, honey, acacia...) and spicy (vanilla). On the palate, sweetness of aroma and sugar content are balanced by the wine's acidity. The wine is suitable for aging. The wine must have a minimum acquired alcohol content of 12% by volume. The amount of (non- fermented) residual sugar must be at least 51 grams per litre. If the wine has been enriched, the potential alcohol content of the wine may not exceed 19% by volume.

Greek sign has been legally recognized as the official language area of the Corinthian community for educational purposes in Greece since 2000. The Greek Semantic Language is estimated to be used by some 40,600 scholars. According to A. The term \\"sign language\\" can be used with the term \\"noun language\\", but this has not been accepted by the Deaf community. On December 19, 2013, he presented the Declaration on the Constitutional Recognition of the Greek Semantic Language.  Historical evolution  The Greek Legal Language is recognized as the first language of children and of heavy students by Law 2817/2000, \\"Deaf with\\" K \\"are people with reduced hearing capacity who are knowledgeable of the Greek language and have adopted the culture of the Deaf who are members of their community. Since 2000, according to the aforementioned law, as well as 3699/2008, knowledge of the Greek Sign Language is a mandatory qualification for the recruitment of young professionals in the education of deaf students. By Law 4488/2017 (Article 65 (2)). The Greek legal language is recognized as equivalent to the Greek language. In addition, the law stipulates that the state is taking measures to promote it and to cover all the communication needs of the deaf and hearing impaired citizens. It is a language that can be analyzed and studied individually. The peculiarity of the sign is that it is visual and not horizontal. It is not expressed, namely by the voice such as the spoken but by the movement and the form of the hands, the expression of the person, the movements of the body. It has its own grammatical and editorial rules that greatly differentiate the spoken word. The use of sign is a basic prerequisite for the integration of any person into the community of Holes, for inclusion in which the degree of acoustic loss does not matter, but the knowledge of language and the respect of the culture of the Apostles.  Use of language  The Greek Sign Language is not international, as it is wrongly believed. Each country develops its own sign language with different basic meanings and a different alphabet. There are common features and many differences at a morphological level. Nevertheless, the Deaf of different states can communicate comfortably through the International Sign, which is essentially a code that serves the simple daily communication needs. As is the case with the spoken languages, dialects exist in each country. Linguistic investigations in various sign languages have shown that each sign language has a specific structure and responds to universal universals of human languages. Although there is no official record, users of the Greek sign language in Greece are estimated at 40,600, having a rapid upward trend due to the great interest in learning the language by listeners. The continuous increase in its distribution is due to its official proclamation, but also to the broadcasting of news and broadcasts by Greek television through interpretation, as well as meetings of the Hellenic Parliament, which are shown by the TV station of Parliament --Television Prisma-- which belonged to the broadcaster of ERT, was the first television channel with interpretation and subtitles on much of its TV program. It should be stressed that Greek Sign Language is used in Greece, but it is not a representation of the spoken Greek language, such as the written language, and can, like any other language, give any expression of the Greek spoken language, including slang. The usefulness of the sign language to facilitate the communication of the deaf is also stressed by Socrates in his dialogue with Ermogenis in Plato's work \\"Kratilios\\". Socrates states specifically: \\"If we did not have a voice or a tongue, and yet we would like to express ourselves among us, would we not, as the deers torture, express ourselves with the hands and the head and the other body? The educational material that exists in the Greek Sign Language is limited. Since 2010 there has been a continuous increase in the production of accessible educational material in electronic and printed form for deaf students. The educational and linguistic material developed mainly by public research bodies concerns the teaching of the ENG as the first language, the ENT lexicon, the publication of printed material in the ENG as well as the literary texts in the. This material is available free of charge through the Digital Signature Repository in the Greek Sign Language, which provides the ability to find meaning in all videos for educational and research purposes.

There are doubts about his date of birth, with at least two unattributed sources reporting it as 21 February 1934 or sometime in 1928 respectively. In March 2010, it was reported by news agencies including Yonhap, Bloomberg, and The Guardian that Pak had been tried and then executed by firing squad in Pyongyang for the offense of being \\"a son of a bourgeois conspiring to infiltrate the ranks of revolutionaries to destroy the national economy\\". According to the Guardian, he had been denounced as a traitor during a meeting in January 2010 and arrested on the spot. This related to the devaluation of the North Korean won in November 2009, which led to a crisis after rendering valueless many people's savings. Although John Park, a Stanton junior faculty fellow at MIT, claimed in 2012 that Pak Nam-gi is still alive and had resurfaced after his alleged execution, Ri Je-gang, the former First Deputy Head of the WPK Organization and Guidance Department, says Pak Nam-gi was executed by firing squad in the course of a reactionary purge in 2010.

Geographical description  The geographical area of this appellation extends over 8 communes and is divided into two small islands separated from each other by the Pouilly-Fuissé appelation. It is made up of the villages of Davayé, Prissé and Solutré-Pouilly in the north, and Chânes, Chasselas, Leynes, Saint-Amour and Saint-Vérand in the south. All these villages are located in the extreme south of the Mâconnais subregion and of the Burgundy wine region as a whole.  Historical background  A Chardonnay from Saint- Véran. The Saint-Véran appelation came into being on January 6, 1971. An enthronement ceremony was held at the Château de la Balmondière in Saint Vérand. The AOC wine produced by the 6 Mâconnais communes of Chânes, Chasselas, Davayé, Leynes, Prissé and Saint-Vérand was christened Saint-Véran (without a final 'd'), the old spelling of the village's name.  Vineyards = Features  * Grape varieties grown: Saint-Véran wines are produced entirely from Chardonnay grapes. * Pruning: The pruning method known as \\"taille à queue du Mâconnais\\" (lit. Maconnais tail pruning) is typical of the Maconnais district and is a variation on Guyot pruning. This technique of bending of the wood into an arc during pruning is designed to prevent acrotony, a characteristic defect of Chardonnay vines, and also serves to protect the plants against spring frosts. * Surface area of land under production: The Saint-Veran appellation covers of land and produces 39,030 hectolitres of wine. * Maximum yield: 55 hectolitres/hectare.INAO website  Geology and terroirs  From north to south, the terroir (soil type, climate and wine-growing tradition) of Saint-Véran borders directly on that of its neighbour, the Pouilly-Fuissé appellation, and together they share soils that are a mixture of chalk and clay. The area ranges in altitude from 250 to 450 metres. The south-south-east facing slopes that enjoy the most sunshine.  Named vineyards  Le Clos, Au Château, les Peiguins, Au Bourg, A la Croix, Aux Bulands and Vers le Mont are the climats/lieux-dits (specific named vineyards) with the most desirable micro-climates, and which sometimes be found indicated on the labels together with the name Saint-Véran.  Wine type, gastronomical features and serving temperatures  It is a pale golden colour when young, taking on a rich amber hue over time and often improving with age. Wine connoisseurs appreciated Saint-Veran's qualities before the appellation was officially recognized. With its complex, ample and elegant bouquet, this typical Burgundy wine offers round, powerful flavours on the palate. Depending on the year and the batch, one can detect fruity notes of white peach, apple or pear, or floral notes of lime-blossom or acacia that give way, over time, to notes of hazelnut or almond, offset by delicate touches of honey, vanilla and flint. It can for example be matched with chicken in a cream sauce, veal sweetbreads or fish. Saint-Véran should be served at around 11 °C and is best opened a few minutes before being served, allowing time for the full richness of its aroma to be released.

Côtes de Duras is located in the department of Lot-et-Garonne, and is located immediately adjacent to the Bordeaux wine region, which is restricted to the Gironde department, as an extension of Bordeaux immediately to the east of the departmental border. History 18th century map of the area that includes several communes in the Côtes de Duras. Wine from the area around Duras have been famous since the time of the French monarch, Francis I. After the Edict of Nantes had been revoked and local French Protestants had moved to the Low Countries, wine exports to ports around the North Sea suddenly expanded. Later this area became part of the Haut Pays Bordelais or upper Bordeaux wine country, and its exports were handled by merchants based in the Chartrons district of the city of Bordeaux, just like the wines produced closer to the city of Bordeaux itself. This was a golden age, which ended when use of the Bordeaux appellation was restricted to wines from the Gironde department in the 1930s. This appellation was granted on the 16th of February, 1937. Climate and geography The Côtes de Duras (highlighted in red box) is almost equal distance between Bordeaux and Cahors and is just southwest of Bergerac. The Côtes de Duras oceanic climate is identical to that of the Bordeaux region, except that it experiences slightly more extreme temperatures because of its distance from the ocean. This wine- growing area is situated in the north-west of Lot-et-Garonne where it borders the Gironde and Dordogne departments. Wine from this appellation grows on tertiary fluvio-lacustrine sediments that occur in three different forms: * Calcaire de Castillon , which is white, chalky and contains cracks of varying depths. * Molasses de l'Agenais (Agenais Molasses), which is layers of clay or clay-sand mix alternating with beds of gravel. * Calcaire blanc de l'Agenais . Wine-growing area Harvesting Sauvignon blanc grapes in the Côtes de Duras with a mechanical harvester. This terroir lies on the right bank of the Dropt and is divided into two by the Dourdèze valley. This wine-growing area is spread across 15 communes: Auriac-sur-Dropt, Baleyssagues, Duras, Esclottes, Loubes-Bernac, Moustier, Pardaillan, Saint-Astier, Sainte-Colombe-de-Duras, Saint-Jean-de-Duras, Saint-Sernin, La Sauvetat-du-Dropt, Savignac-de-Duras, Soumensac and Villeneuve-de-Duras. Organizational structures According to 2005 data provided by the INAO (Institut National des Appellations d'Origine), 121,948 hectolitres were produced from 2,038 hectares, and production was spread across 86 private cellars and 3 cooperative cellars and wine-merchants. Grape varieties and wines Malbec. * White wines: Sauvignon blanc, Sémillon, Muscadelle, Mauzac, Rouchelein or Chenin blanc and Ondenc. Ugni blanc is a supplementary grape variety that may not exceed 25% of the total used. * Red wines: Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Côt. * Dry white wines: restricted to a yield of 60 hectolitres/hectare, these wines are characterized by their Sauvignon-like nose and vigorous flavours. They are produced at low temperatures and sometimes undergo pre-fermentation maceration or are matured on the lees. * Medium-sweet white wines: restricted to 50 hectolitres/hectare, these wines have an aroma of candied fruit. Some batches are made into dessert wines using the sweetest grapes from the crop that have been harvested at regular intervals. * Rosé wines: restricted to 55 hectolitres/hectare, these wines are fresh and fruity. They are made from juice that has been bled from red wine vats. * Red wines: restricted to 55 hectolitres/hectare, they are usually supple and fruity, but some batches, in particular those that have been aged in oak casks, can be more robust.

It is located on the right bank of the River Gironde, and surrounds Côtes de Bourg. Appellations d'origine contrôlée A number of different Appellations d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) apply, or have previously applied, to Blaye. In 1936, 3 AOCs were created for this region: Blaye AOC, Côtes de Blaye AOC and Premières Côtes de Blaye AOC. These all covered the same geographical area, with Premières Côtes de Blaye including the most prestigious properties.Johnson(1994), p108; Rowe, p46 These AOCs were revised in the 1990s, and Blaye AOC was used for the top reds (while still being used for some simple dry whites).Johnson(2009), p43 In 2007, the AOCs were revised again. Blaye AOC is now exclusively red, and Côtes de Blaye AOC is exclusively white.

The Townhouse supports artistic work in a wide range of media through exhibitions, residencies for artists and curators, educational initiatives and outreach programs. By establishing local and international relationships, as well as diversifying both the practitioners and audiences of contemporary art, the Townhouse aims to support and expand the knowledge, appreciation and practice of contemporary arts in Egypt and the region. Exhibits and programs The gallery is located in downtown Cairo’s bustling car mechanics district. It curates over twelve annual exhibitions in the 650-square-meter Factory and the First Floor gallery of its main building. The exhibitions feature the work of young emerging artists alongside those who are internationally recognized. Many local artists with early shows at the Townhouse have gone on to exhibit worldwide. The Townhouse has initiated numerous large-scale events, beginning with the citywide Nitaq Festival in 1999. PhotoCairo, the first festival in Egypt exclusively dedicated to photography and video art, was launched in 2002. Since its inception, the Townhouse has strived to make the arts accessible to different groups of society, whilst using them as a powerful medium for integration and understanding. The gallery's Outreach Program offers a number of arts workshops for adults and children, with participants coming from all over Cairo, including those with special needs and from marginalized communities. The gallery collaborates with institutions and arts professionals both regionally and internationally to create exhibitions, share resources, and facilitate artist exchanges. Each year, several international artists hold residencies at the Townhouse, working in studios on the gallery premises and pursuing independent projects in the city. Visiting artists often lead workshops during their stay. In 2009, the Townhouse launched the Rooftop Studio Project, a local residency program for Egyptian artists in need of affordable workspaces. The gallery is currently expanding its residency opportunities to curators and writers with the aim of providing opportunities for interdisciplinary practices to emerge and be independently sustained. Located on the second floor of Townhouse's main building, the library holds books, journals, and other publications related to the arts. Sections are dedicated to Egyptian art history, monographs on Egyptian artists, and catalogues of exhibitions featuring the work of artists from the Middle East. The library is also a resource for artists researching grants and scholarships as well as educators who want to learn more about child development, refugee issues, and other topics. List of artists Ahmed Askalany, Amal Kenawy, Amina Mansour, Amre Heiba, Basim Magdy, Barry Iverson, Ayman Ramdan, Doa Aly, Hala Alkoussy, Huda Lutfi, Jihan Ammar, Lara Baladi, Maha Maamoun, Martin Mcinally, Mohamed Skarkawy, Nader Sadek, Nermine Hammam, Omar Ghayyatt, Osama Dawod, Rana El Nemer, Rehab El Sadek, Sabah Naim, Scott Baily, Shady El Noshokaty, Susan Hefuna, Tarek Zaki, Wael Shawky, Warren Neidich, Yasser Gerab, Youssef Nabil. Exhibits and events In 2000 and 2001, the Townhouse Gallery contributed to the establishment of the Nitaq Festival in Cairo, which was an art festival situated in downtown that aimed to expose the contemporary art scene to the public. The festival included multimedia video installations that were created by various artists including Lara Baladi, Amina Mansour, Hassan Khan, Wael Shawky and Mona Marzouk. Townhouse also initiated Egypt's first exhibition dedicated to photography in 2002, calling it PhotoCairo, with the aim of exposing the public to the various forms of self-expression that are evident in the world of photography. This event proved to be quite successful in 2002 so the event was repeated in 2003 and 2004, accompanied by the Open Studio Project. Recent exhibits that have been on display during February and March 2010 in the Townhouse Gallery include “The Girl Splendid in Walking” by Doa Aly and “Making A Man Out of Him” by a Professor at the American University in Cairo, Huda Lutfi.The Townhouse Gallery Both works have proven themselves quite unique to their audiences, each providing a specific experience to the visitors of the Townhouse Gallery. Regarding Doa Aly's work, the video installation, inspired by Wilhelm Jenson's “Gradiva”, includes scenes where the girl was in a room, walking and tracing the sunlight with her feet as it beamed through the window, like she was going after the light. Meanwhile, Lutfi's “Making a Man Out of Him”, uses the symbolism of the male anatomy as a means of criticizing society's perspective on masculinity. This illustrates how the Townhouse Gallery has the ability to display art that may be viewed as controversial. Overall feedback on the Townhouse Gallery Negar Azmy, a Harvard graduate student who worked as a curatorial assistant in the Townhouse Gallery, wrote an article in Nafas Art Magazine. According to this, the Townhouse Gallery, among other private galleries in Egypt, has provided a “home” for the display of visual arts, especially given its recent widespread popularity. However, it is argued by Azmy that “politics remain intimately tied to the arts” and that it is “undeniable” that the state still plays a role in deciding what is displayed in not only the Townhouse, but other independent galleries and museums. Despite this claim, Azmy also argues that Egyptian artists are indeed flourishing as various galleries in Europe have contacted them in order to display their work.

Early life Falleni was born in Italy, near either Livorno (according to family accounts) or Florence. Assigned female at birth and named Eugenia, Falleni was the eldest of 22 children, of whom seventeen survived childhood. He migrated with his parents to Wellington, New Zealand , at age 2. His father, a stern disciplinarian, worked as a carrier with a horse and cart and as a fisherman, among other occupations. After repeatedly dressing in male attire to obtain work in brickyards and stables during his teenage years, Falleni married in September 1894, but soon learnt that his husband was already married, and in 1895, Falleni left home and began calling himself Eugene and began working on a ship as a cabin boy. His family made little effort to find him after years of being hostile and opposed to his behaviour. Falleni later recounted that after a few years at sea, he inadvertently disclosed during a drunken conversation with the ship's captain, a man named Martello, that he had been raised as female: speaking in Italian, Falleni stated that his grandmother referred to him as a piccolina (the feminine form of the noun for 'little one'). Falleni was ostracised by the rest of the crew and repeatedly raped by the captain. As having a woman on board a ship was traditionally viewed as an invitation to bad luck, Falleni was put ashore pregnant and destitute in 1898, at the ship's next port of call in Newcastle, New South Wales. In Sydney, Falleni gave birth to a daughter, Josephine Crawford Falleni, and put the child into the care of an Italian-born woman, Mrs. de Angelis, in Double Bay. He took on the male identity of Harry Leo Crawford, of supposed Scots descent, visiting his daughter only infrequently. Josephine Falleni called de Angelis 'Granny', who told her that her father was a sea captain.  Relationship with Annie Birkett  In 1912, after a series of manual jobs in abattoirs, pubs, and in a rubber factory, Falleni entered the employ of a Dr. G. R. C. Clarke in Wahroonga, Northern Sydney, as a general useful and sulky driver. It was there that he met Clarke's housekeeper Annie Birkett, who had been widowed several years before, with a son named Harry Birkett. Birkett and her son left for Balmain, where she used some money she had to set up a confectionery shop. Falleni followed her there and took an interest in the business. On 19 February 1913, Falleni and Birkett were married at the Methodist parsonage in inner city Balmain. Soon after, the couple moved to Drummoyne, where Falleni worked in hotels and factories at various kinds of work. Birkett's death According to Falleni and witnesses at his later trial, Birkett was not aware that he was transgender until 1917, when a neighbour told her. Falleni refused to confirm this to Birkett when she confronted him, fearing that she would tell the police and have him arrested. On 1 October 1917, Birkett suggested that the two of them have a picnic near Lane Cove River. According to Falleni's later statement to the police, the two of them quarrelled after she revealed her intention to leave him. Falleni reported that during the argument she slipped and fell backwards, hitting her head on a rock. He said that he tried to save her but she died within minutes, and in a panic that he would be investigated and exposed as transgender, he attempted to burn the body beyond identification. Falleni told Birkett's son that she had run off with another man, while a witness at the later trial also claimed Falleni had told them Birkett had 'cleared out'. Birkett's body was discovered in scrub land off Mowbray Road, Chatswood. The medical examiner reported \\"no definite marks of violence\\" and concluded she had died \\"probably due to burns\\". The body was not identified at that time, and newspaper accounts reported that the police believed it to be a case of suicide, based on accounts of a woman 'whose manner has been regarded as strange' being recently seen in the area, and the discovery of a small bottle of kerosene. Ultimately, an open verdict was returned at the inquest and the remains were buried in a coffin marked 'the body of an unknown woman' at Rookwood Cemetery. In 1919, Falleni met Elizabeth King Allison, known as Lizzie, who was over fifty years of age. They married at Canterbury in September 1919, with Falleni giving his name as Harry Leo Crawford, his place of birth as Scotland, and his occupation as mechanical engineer.  Arrest  After Birkett's disappearance, her son took up lodgings at Woolloomooloo. In 1920, he visited his aunt and reported that upon returning from a holiday weekend and discovering that his mother was missing, Falleni took him to The Gap, a notorious suicide spot, where he threw stones off the cliff and tried to entice the boy closer to the edge. At night, about a week later, Falleni took him to scrub land near Manning Road, Double Bay, and asked him to dig a hole. He did, but an emotional Falleni then threw the shovel into the bushes and they returned to the city. These actions made Harry Birkett suspicious of his father, as did his recollection of his illiterate father asking him to read an article about the shoes of the unknown burns victim. Harry Birkett went to the police, and was able to identify the victim's personal effects as his mother's, in particular, her shoes which Falleni had personally repaired. Falleni was arrested at his workplace on 5 July 1920. Falleni asked to be placed in the women's cells. He had been living with Allison in a house in Stanmore, but requested that his wife not be told that he was transgender. His lawyer, Maddocks Cohen, did not apply for bail. Birkett's remains were exhumed, but a second post-mortem, including x-rays, did not reveal any new information and her body was released to her family for burial at Woronora. Falleni's daughter was located and interviewed by the police. Trial, later life, and death At the committal hearing in August 1920, witnesses included the dentist who made the false teeth found with Birkett's remains and Birkett's sister, Lillie Nugent, who also identified the gemstone found with the body as belonging to the deceased. Birkett's son testified that his mother had only married Falleni because he was so persistent and after that 'there were always rows and they were never happy'. He mentioned them leaving for his aunt's, then another location, and how much Falleni 'worried' his mother and an incident when Falleni found them and 'smashed up everything'. He expanded on his story of his trip with Falleni to The Gap and testified that Falleni had tried to lure him over the fence to the cliff edge. Falleni's lawyer, Maddocks Cohen, objected to his evidence about being taken to dig holes in the scrub, but the magistrate allowed it on the grounds that it indicated Falleni's frame of mind. The Government Medical Officer, Dr Palmer, repeated his testimony from the post-mortem that he believed the deceased died of burns and was alive when the fire began, due to blistering on the skin, but he could not say if she was conscious or not. He also stated that small cracks to the skull were likely a result of the fire, but a more substantial one could have been evidence of violence. Henrietta Schieblich, who rented Falleni a room after Birkett's death, said Falleni had told her his wife had left him and added, 'We had a jolly good row, and I gave her a crack on the head, and she cleared'. She also claimed Falleni had said he was going to kill Birkett's son on the night he took him to dig holes in the scrub. Another witness supported the son's evidence that Falleni, who couldn't read or write, had asked others to look for mentions of a murder in the newspapers in the weeks after Birkett's disappearance. The prosecutor was given permission to treat Falleni's daughter Josephine as a hostile witness and submitted her earlier sworn statement to police as evidence: > \\"I first remember my mother when about seven years of age. She always wore > men's clothing, and was known as Harry Crawford. I was brought up at Double > Bay by Mrs. de Angelis, whom I used to call 'Granny.' Granny told me that > Harry Crawford was my mother, and that my father was the captain of a boat. > My mother was very cruel to me when I was a child, and often forgot me. > Granny told me that my mother tried to smother me when I was a baby. Mrs. de > Angelis died when I was about 12 years of age, and my mother took me to a > little confectionery shop in Balmain, kept by a Mrs. Birkett, who had a son > named Harry. My mother told me Mrs. Birkett had some money, and always > thought my mother was a man. I said to my mother, 'She'll find you out one > of these days.' My mother replied, 'Oh, I'll watch it. I would rather do > away with myself than let the police find anything about me.' My mother told > me always to call her father, and not let Mrs. Birkett nor anyone else know > that she was a woman. I did not know that my mother was married to Mrs. > Birkett, but they occupied the same bed-room. They quarrelled a great deal, > and mother used to come out and say, 'More rows over you. I cannot get any > sleep.' I replied to my mother, and she said, 'Oh, a lovely daughter I've > got.' I said, 'What can you expect? A lovely mother I've got.' In 1917 I met > my mother, who told me everything was unsettled and upside down, as Mrs. > Birkett had discovered she was a woman. My mother seemed very agitated, and > was always reticent about herself.\\" At the end of the hearing, Falleni was committed for trial and refused bail. A few days after the committal hearing, the magistrate, Mr. Gale, was criticised in a Sydney newspaper for personally escorting into the courtroom, and providing 'box seats' for, a popular actor and actress. At Falleni's trial for murder at Darlinghurst courthouse in October 1920, the ‘Man-Woman case’ created a press sensation, with the accused appearing in the dock first in a man's suit and then in women's clothes. The Crown's case followed the evidence presented at the committal, although the prosecutor was reticent when 'referring to the relations between the accused and the deceased' because 'there were some matters to which he did not care to refer to in the presence of women'. He was rebuked by the presiding Chief Justice, Sir William Cullen, who responded that 'if women came to a criminal court they must not be considered for a moment'. The prosecutor presented a dildo found in a search of Falleni and Lizzie's home in Stanmore, as evidence that he was 'practical in deceipt' about his gender. Evidence from other witnesses did not always support the Crown's case. While on his way to work, David Lowe saw a woman with a suitcase behaving in a 'half-witted' way, who disappeared into the scrub 200 yards from where the burned remains were found. Police-Inspector Mayes was one of those, at the original inquest, who suggested the body may have been of a woman who set herself on fire accidentally. Falleni pleaded not guilty to the murder, but the jury only took two hours to reach their verdict, and he was convicted and condemned to death. Asked by Cullen if he had anything to say, Falleni consulted with his attorney before replying: \\" 'I have been three months in Long Bay Gaol. I am near to a nervous breakdown. I am not guilty, your Honor. I know nothing whatsoever of this charge. It is only through false evidence that I have been convicted.\\" In mid-October, Falleni lodged an appeal against the conviction, the basis of which was: > \\"...that the jury's verdict was against evidence, that the evidence tendered > by the Crown was weak and merely circumstantial; that the case against the > accused set up by the Crown was destroyed by the evidence of the Crown's > medical witnesses; that the identification of the appellant with some person > alleged by the Crown to have been seen in the neighbourhood of the place > where a charred body was found was unsatisfactory, and that owing to nervous > prostration at the trial, the appellant was physically unable to make a > statement of facts, which would have answered the circumstantial > evidence...\\" The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the case finding that if the original jury 'came to the conclusion that the accused was the person who had brought about the death of the woman, no matter by what means, it was justified in finding a verdict of guilty'. Falleni's sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life but the matter of his gender identity and the supposed deception of it was made much of in the popular press, which portrayed him as a monster and a pervert. Friends of Falleni and 'prison reform workers' petitioned 'on several occasions' for his release. In February 1931, reportedly following an hour-long visit with the prisoner, Minister for Justice Joe Lamaro granted Falleni his freedom on the basis that he was nearly sixty years old and 'not of robust health'. Upon leaving Long Bay, Falleni was taken by car 'for an unknown destination'. Questions were again raised by the press about the case, as there was no certainty as to the body being Birkett's, the skull fractures and the effect of the fire, the possibility of poison and the lack of 'definite evidence that Falleni had taken the woman's life'. In April 1935, when Inspector Stuart Robson gave a speech upon taking on the role of officer in charge of the Broken Hill Police District, in which he recalled his involvement with the Falleni case: > \\"I was also responsible for the arrest of Eugenia Falleni, the famous man- > woman. She was the child of an Italian skipper and he dressed her in male > clothes and she worked as a cabin boy. She kept to male attire, and her > exploits are well known. She was convicted for the murder of her 'wife,' and > was sentenced to life imprisonment. I arrested her when she was working as a > man, breaking down rum in a Sydney hotel cellar. That was three years after > the murder. I thought I had arrested a man, and it was not until she > declined to undress that I thought there was something wrong. A doctor made > the discovery. She was subsequently released and has completely > disappeared.\\" Falleni had assumed the name \\"Mrs. Jean Ford\\" and became the proprietor of a boarding house in Paddington, Sydney. On 9 June 1938, he was struck by a motorcar in nearby Oxford Street, and died of his injuries the following day in Sydney Hospital. He was only identified through fingerprint records and the £100 he gained from the sale of the boarding house business, just before the accident, found in his bag. The inquest returned a verdict of accidental death. Falleni's funeral notice was announced under his final name and he was buried in the Church of England section of Rookwood Cemetery. Legacy In the intervening years, after the publication by the press and popular crime writers of a large amount of speculation and various contradictory accounts of his life (many of them propagated by Falleni himself, who had grown up believing that impersonating a man was a criminal offence), the case was largely forgotten until the appearance of a detailed biography of Falleni, titled Eugenia: A Man, was written by Suzanne Falkiner in 1988, after which his story was taken up in Australia by a number of artists, playwrights and short film makers, museum and photography curators, and academics with an interest in gender studies. A play based on the life of Falleni by New Zealand playwright Lorae Parry premiered in the U.S. at the State University of New York at New Paltz on 1 March 2012. Also in 2012, Mark Tedeschi QC wrote a conjectural or partly fictionalised biography of Falleni, entitled Eugenia Falleni (Simon and Schuster). A new edition of Falkiner's book, summarising new information, was published in 2014. The case was also detailed in a 2016 episode of Felon True Crime Podcast.

August 2010 Kilcommon () is a civil parish in Erris, north Mayo consisting of two large peninsulas; Dún Chaocháin and Dún Chiortáin. It consists of 37 townlands, some of which are so remote that they have no inhabitants. Habitation is concentrated mainly along both sides of Sruwaddacon Bay which flows into Broadhaven Bay, in villages including Glengad, Pollathomas, Rossport, Inver and Carrowteige, and in the Glenamoy area further inland.Kilcommon-Erris, Mayo County, Ireland: Lewis, 1837 description History The view from Dún Chiortán promontory fort, Glengad, Kilcommon, Erris. Kilcommon parish takes its name from St. Comán who lived around the end of the sixth century AD. The saint is allegedly buried in the old church yard at Pollatomais, near to the entrance where the walls of the old Church can still be seen. In the Ordnance Survey Letters of 1838 (O'Donovan), the writers says \\"of the old church itself only a part of one gable remains from which little can be learned of its style or age\\". Topography Much of the Kilcommon landscape of elevated moorland, borders the Atlantic coast. It is a wild and rugged landscape with large tracts of blanket bog, tiny isolated villages, white sandy beaches and towering cliffs of Benwee Head which, for thousands of years has remained relatively unscathed by overdevelopment by successive generations of Kilcommon inhabitants. Farming is small scale non-intensive. Situated at the mouth of Broadhaven Bay, on its 21st century surface, Kilcommon is characterised by its scenery, huge towering cliffs and rugged sea stacks interspersed with miles of white sandy beaches, tranquil islands and vast tracts of blanket bog with its rare and fragile biodiversity. Unlike the west of Ireland landscape further south in Galway and Clare, there are few huge rocks randomly scattered across this landscape. The blanket bog dominates the landscape changing its hues and texture in accordance with the seasons – sometimes fresh and brightest green, sometimes purple and gold and covered with billowing white bog cotton, and, in November and December, the wonderful rustic tones of golden orange/red species light up the winter landscape. At all times the bog is a living habitat for many species of insects, spiders and plants for whom this is the perfect habitat not found anywhere else. Grey fronted geese fly across on their way to their breeding grounds further north and it is possible to spot the corncrake and the rare red-necked phalarope whose only breeding ground left in Ireland is in this remote corner of the country. Geology GneissSchist Kilcommon parish comprises a very ancient landscape of glittering schist and pale creamy psammite along with some two billion year old pre-Cambrian pink striped gneisses. Boulders of snow white quartz which intruded into the bedrock from geological turmoil below, some 450 million years ago (Silurian period) are to be found in the western part of the parish. The bedrock, exposed when the blanket bog is cut away to provide fuel for the rural community here, demonstrate that this land has seen geomorphological turmoil over the last two billion years – periods of intense heat, intense cold, pressure and tectonic shifts which have moulded and remoulded the landscape into what it is today. There are two main peninsulas in the parish - Dún Chiortáin and Dún Chaocháin. They are named for two 'giant' brothers who live on in the folklore of the area. They each had a Dún or a promontory fort and folktales relate that they shared kitchen utensils which they used to throw across Sruwaddacon Bay (Sruth Fhada Chonn - Bay of the Long Hound) which divided their territories. Broadhaven, Kilcommon Parish, Erris Sea cliffs run along much of the coast from the high Benwee Head and along the north coastline to Glinsk mountain. The rocky islands known as The Stags, pictured below are to be seen off the North Kilcommon coastline.http://www.mayolibrary.ie/en/LocalStudies/ Archaeology Unclassified megalith on northern slopes of Faulagh Mountain, Kilcommon parish, Erris The fossilised remains of ancient Scots pine trees which were part of the ancient forests which covered most of inland Ireland after the retreat of the last Ice Age some 15,000 years ago are to be seen across the landscape, exposed by turf cutting in recent years. There are many archaeological remains throughout the parish also, mainly in the western portion as the land to the east was, and still remains to a great extent, inaccessible and uninhabited. The area has a very large number of megalithic tomb remains and most types of megalithic are represented although because there has been no money spent on archaeological investigation in this parish, the archaeological resource is little documented. In the eastern portion of the parish there is evidence of the presence of possible crannogs in lakes which point towards some habitation in the past. In recent times the growth of blanket bog, conifer forestry plantations and the absence of roads through the area, has made townlands such as Bunalty, Barrooskey, Baralty, Srahnaplaigh and Muingnabo difficult to access except by the most intrepid of explorers. In the western parts of the parish, archaeological remains stretching from the Mesolithic through Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Early Christian, Plantations, to the current day are widely seen.http://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/2133/gortbrack_north_portal_tomb.htmhttp://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/2134/gortbrack_north_court_tomb.htmhttp://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/1060/rosdoagh.htmhttp://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/914/dooncarton_court_tomb.htmhttp://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/913/dooncarton_stone_circle.htm thumb200pxrightOn Cnoc Nansai, Graughil.

That territorial name and boundary is still used for civil administration.http://www.mayo- ireland.ie/Mayo/Towns/Belmul/SunSetsBook.htm Civil parishes and townlands Kilcommon used to refer to almost all of Erris but it was so large that in the early 19th century, it was further divided into three districts - Ballycroy, Kilcommon West and Kilcommon East. In 1873 it was again reorganised and divided into four civil-parishes - Kilmore, Ballycroy, Kiltane and Kilcommon which remain to this day. There are 37 townlands in the modern parish of Kilcommon.

Corrib Gas Since around the turn of the 21st century, Kilcommon parish has been affected by Corrib gas project, under the ownership of Royal Dutch Shell. After many years and many changes of proposed route for a high pressure raw gas pipeline running through the area many aspects of the proposed project have been strongly disputed. A refinery has been built 10 kilometres inland by Royal Dutch Shell that has no access to the proposed landfall site. There have been several Oral Hearings held about this problem by An Bord Pleanála but Permission has now been granted. Works commenced in July 2011.http://www.pleanala.ie/casenum/GA0004.htmhttp://www.pleanala.ie/casenum/DA0004.htm There have been many protests Natural resources Kilcommon Erris has some of the best natural alternative energy resources in the world due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean which brings almost constant winds from the sea. The natural resources of ocean and wind available in Kilcommon are very valuable resources for sustainable alternative, renewable energy production for the future. There are opportunities for the development of ocean wave power projects, one of the best wave energy resources in the world lies off the shores of North Mayo. Tidal power, hydroelectric schemes, and extensive wind farms are amongst many other clean, alternative energy generation opportunities for which the area has great potential for a beneficial sustainable future.http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=9163:sea- water-energy-planned-for-glinsk&catid;=23:news&Itemid;=46 References Lewis, Samuel, Topographic Dictionary External links *http://www.vimeo.com/8668733 *http://www.arasinisgluaire.ie/ *http://shelltosea.com *http://www.mayowalks.ie *http://www.uisce.ie/ *http://errisunitedfc.ie *http://bangorerrisangling.com Category:History of County Mayo Category:Civil parishes of County Mayo Category:Archaeological sites in County Mayo Category:Gaeltacht towns and villages Category:Erris Category:Gaeltacht places in County Mayo Category:Tourist attractions in County Mayo ","title":"Kilcommon (County Mayo civil parish)"},{"id":"26601416","text":"Lampronia rupella is a moth of the family Prodoxidae.

Members are the Vatican City and the 193 UN members except Andorra, Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau. The newest member is South Sudan, which joined on 4 October 2011. Before 10 July 1964, states became members of the UPU by ratifying the latest version of the Treaty of Bern. After this date, states become members by ratifying the Constitution of the Universal Postal Union, which incorporated the Treaty of Bern and added provisions to it. Three states which were party to the Treaty of Bern in 1964, and hence members of the UPU, and which have signed but never ratified the Constitution are members of the UPU Dominican Republic, Honduras, Sudan. These states are deemed to have \\"tacitly ratified\\" the agreement due to their continued participation in the UPU. Also included as members are two \\"joint memberships\\" for dependent territories (one for the British overseas territories and one for the Caribbean constituent countries () of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten), originally as Netherlands Antilles). Dependent territories are not permitted to ratify the UPU Constitution, but because the Treaty of Bern allowed for dependencies to join the UPU, listing these members separately as \\"Colonies, Protectorates, etc.\\", the Constitution of the Universal Postal Union grandfathered them when membership was restricted to sovereign states. However, neither the British nor the Dutch entities ratified the Treaty of Bern separate from the ratifications of the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, respectively. By virtue of article 23 of the UPU Constitution, other dependencies of UPU member states are covered by its membership. Territories covered by a sovereign member state are listed under that country.

These are customary divisions of the legal year when contracts traditionally begin and end and payments are due. It received Royal Assent on 13 July 1990 and immediate commencement, with the dates of the days changing twelve months later. The changes arose from a Scottish Law Commission Report on the Scottish Term and Quarter Days. Substantive Provisions Section 1 of the Act defines the four quarter days as Candlemas on 28 February, Whitsunday on 28 May, Lammas on 28 August and Martinmas on 28 November, with Whitsunday and Martinmas being the two term days. This Act provides that any lease, agreement or undertaking, whether written or oral, which contains a specific or general reference to a term or quarter day, including those concluded before the change, shall be understood as referring to the new definitions of the days (i.e. as 28 February/May/August/November). Where it was intended in a contract concluded prior to the passing of the Act that a reference to a term or quarter day was intended to refer specifically to the previous date of that day rather than the term or quarter day generally, it is possible under sub- section (5) to apply to the Sheriff to have the reference interpreted in this way. The Sheriff's decision in this application is final. Under sub-section (7), where a reference is made to one of the term of quarter days and the date of this day is incorrectly specified in the contract in terms of the Act (i.e. not as 28 February/May/August/November), the date actually specified in the contract is to be used rather than that in the Act.

The film, which has been hailed as the first musical- documentary, features around 20 musical numbers shot on location in various places around Anatolia and examines the influence of ancient civilizations, rituals and mythology of the land on traditional music and dance. Production Turkish composer, producer and arranger Nezih Ünen was inspired to make the film by Peter Gabriel’s Passion album, which includes Anatolian folk songs. Talking about the film to Hürriyet Daily News and Economic Review the director stated, \\"A hundred years ago, cinema and the music industry started to grow up and circulate freely. While the world was developing quickly in culture and arts, Anatolia was left to solitude despite all its riches,\\" and \\"We should dote on Anatolia, protect all its riches and hand down this heritage to the next generations. This is our primary responsibility.\\" The director also clarified that the film was meant to be a movie, not a documentary, since \\"Anatolia would reveal the truth about itself on its own. If it was a documentary, it would be too didactic. So I wanted it to be a movie composing its own poetry.\\" \\"West lovers started to assume themselves as the lords of Istanbul. They look down upon the East and east Anatolia as the ‘other.’ The ‘gentlemen of Istanbul’ who try to become Western without internalizing their own culture got stuck between East and West,\\" the director said of the development of Turkish cultural attitudes since the foundation of the Turkish Republic. \\"In fact, when I realize that I do not know Anatolian people, I understood that I did not know myself either. After I became aware of this, I decided to do something about it and started from the point I knew best,\\"ref name=\\"HDN02\\" /> he added. \\"Turkey should not be a country fearing the diversity of its people and their languages,\\" the director stated, confirming that \\"Armenian songs would be performed for the first time in a movie. This is a beginning in Turkish cinema history. I hope this will continue.\\" \\"Financial difficulties did not deter us from our way,\\" the director said of the project which saw him spend eight years wandering from village to village compiling the folk songs of Anatolia. During this research he took recordings for 350 hours and compiled archives of hundreds of folk songs from which he assembled the film. \\"There were many things to talk about,\\" he stated: \\"I was unwilling to cut or remove any information or scene, but the time was limited.\\" \\"I insist that the movie is poetry. I do not want to waste the materials at hand. So I wanted to prepare a documentary. Viewing the documentary, the audience would feel that they travelled Anatolia from one end to the other,\\" the director said of his plans to prepare a documentary using the leftover parts of his research. Plot A musical journey among the many historic places and ethnic peoples of Anatolia, this documentary offers live recordings of 20 lesser-known or forgotten local folksongs, performed by the native artists of that particular region. Release The film premiered at the 28th Istanbul International Film Festival (4–19 April 2009). The film opened on general release in 26 screens across Turkey on at number seventeen in the Turkish box office chart, with an opening weekend gross of $21,579. Reception=Box office The film has made a total gross of $51,714. Reviews \\"There are many artists and musicians in my lands\\", musician Selahattin Güçtekin, who appears in the film, told Today's Zaman following the première, \\"but they are lost, they are not known because they do not have opportunities\\". \\"There were many more talented people than us, and they are not alive any more\\", added his co-performer and younger brother Fahrettin Güçtekin: \\"and we are following their lead so that their voices aren’t lost. We always would like to take part in such projects in order to support our culture.\\" \\"This project was necessary for this country\\", prominent folk musician Arif Sağ told Today's Zaman following the premiere. \\"I think it’s a very smart idea\\", he said of the two brothers singing a traditional Kurdish elegy, \\"and it should have been made years ago. Those taboos should have been broken long ago.\\" \\"Nezih is one of the musicians who knows Turkish music very well\\", Erhan Güleryüz told Today's Zaman. \\"This is a very good work about what exists in Anatolia. I believe we will be able to take lessons from this film even years later. I'm sure that there are many undiscovered songs in Anatolia, but thanks to musicians like Nezih, these songs are seeing the light of day.\\" Hatice Ahsen Utku, writing for Today's Zaman, says that, \\"in a period when Turkey has started to recognize its minorities and different cultures\\", the \\"must-see\\" film, \\"is capable of providing an answer to the critical process which Turkey is going through with the question, 'Who are living in these lands and since when?'\\" \\"This isn’t a film with a significant storyline or direction\\", and \\"it would be wrong to expect the film to be an in-depth musical investigation of all of Anatolia and its cultures\\", states Emine Yıldırım, writing in Today's Zaman, \\"However, the film gets to the gist of the matter and presents some of the most powerful folksongs from each region to the audience.\\" \\"The beauty of it is that Ünen doesn’t re-perform the songs with a new choir or new orchestra; on the contrary, as the person he films/interviews starts singing the folksong, suddenly we hear the rhythm and beats of an off-screen orchestra supporting the singer.\\" \\"What is so powerful about the recordings, besides the arrangements, is that they bristle with authenticity and capture the genuineness and zest of the subjects.\\" \\"Lost Songs of Anatolia is not only a brilliant musical documentary (the rich visuals and dynamic editing support the technical aspects), but it also transforms itself into one of the most important visual archives of the last decade. Never before has such a systematic and creative audiovisual study of Anatolian music of such scope reached the public -- one which actually has a chance of getting the attention of the people and encouraging the notion of protecting cultural heritage.\\" Emrah Güler, writing for Hürriyet Daily News, describes the film as \\"a unique documentary on traditional music and folk dance from Anatolia\\", and recommends it to \\"those who would like to catch the rare chance of seeing and listening to a selection of the surprisingly distinctive traditional music and folk dance of Turkey.\\"  See also  * 2010 in film * Turkish films of 2010 ReferencesExternal links * for the film (in Turkish) * * Filmpot Distributor page for the film Category:2010 films Category:Turkish films Category:2010 documentary films Category:Films set in Turkey Category:Turkish documentary films Category:Turkish music Category:Documentary films about music and musicians ","title":"Lost Songs of Anatolia"},{"id":"26601621","text":"Dilettante was an online classical music hub based in London, England.

He mainly worked for left-wing, socialist and anti-fascist magazines and newspapers, creating thousands of political cartoons. Biography George van Raemdonck was born in Antwerp in 1888. His father, who worked as a pharmacist, also was a talented draftsman. His mother, who was French, died when George was still young. Because George van Raemdonck was gifted with some musical talent, he was sent to the conservatory to study the violin. At the same time, he started painting, and in 1903, aged fifteen, he entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, where he was taught by Franz Courtens, and where he won the 1913 de Keyer's Prize. During those years, he already made illustrations for a number of novels and for the magazine Lange Wapper. He left Antwerp to live in Zwijndrecht on 29 July 1909. On 12 April 1913, he married Adriana Denissen, and their first daughter Pauline is born on 21 February 1914. His second daughter Anna was born on 22 February 1916. Because of the First World War, he fled on 9 October 1914 with his wife and child to the Netherlands, where he soon started drawing political cartoons for De Amsterdammer. In 1920 he left De Amsterdammer to commence work at De Notenkraker, where he contributed until it folded in July 1936. Dutch writer A. M. De Jong was impressed by his work and asked him at the end of 1917 to illustrate his juvenile novel Vacantiedagen. They soon became friends. In 1922, De Jong asked him to provide the drawings for the comic strip Bulletje en Boonestaak, which was published between 2 May 1922 and 17 November 1937 in Het Volk, the daily newspaper of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, and in Voorwaarts. The author and artist regularly added references to one another or cameos of each other in the strip. The comic strip was collected in books in Dutch, with at least 66 different editions so far, and has been translated in German in 1924 and in French in 1926. They also created together the book Vrolike Vertelsels, with 62 drawings by van Raemdonck, written by De Jong with the pen name Frank van Waes. Another comic strip they cocreated was Appelsnoet en Goudbaard, published between 1925 and 1927 in the magazine Blue Band, a purely commercial publication by a butter producer. On 12 November 1928, van Raemdonck moved back to Belgium and started painting again, but he continued his close collaboration with De Jong until the sudden death of De Jong during the Second World War, when he was assassinated on 18 October 1943 by Dutch SS members. Apart from the comics, their most successful collaboration was the bookseries Merijntje Gijzen, which started in 1935 and was made into a film in 1936. After the war, van Raemdonck started a long-term collaboration with writer L. Roelandt (pen name of Jef Van Droogenbroeck), creating together the comic strips Tijl Uilenspiegel, appearing from 1964 on in Vooruit, Smidje Smee and Robinson Crusoë. He lived his last years in Boechout, where he died in 1966. In his memory, every three years since 1986 a cartoon contest, the George van Raemdonck Kartoenale, is held in Belgium, with the 11th edition in 2008. A monument representing Bulletje en Boonestaak has been placed in Boechout, and a park in the same town has been named in his honour.

There are two rules for the contest: Entries should be edible, and they must somehow relate to a book. Besides edible books, other entries include \\"edible book trucks\\" and \\"edible bookmarks\\". The event kicks off with viewing of the entries, each of which has an information card describing the book title, author, and creator of the book art. The \\"books\\" are judged by a panel of judges and by public voting. Awards are given in categories like: Most Creative, Least Edible, Best Overall Fiction, Best Overall Non-Fiction, and Best Children's Book.

The consortium is implementing a 2-year project, funded by the UK government’s Department for International Development (DFID). This project consists of the following components: * creating an emergency response fund to provide predictable funds in the first 48 hours of an emergency so that agencies will have the resources and capacity to deliver emergency assistance in the immediate aftermath of a disaster or other crisis, in advance of other emergency funding becoming available. * running capacity building initiatives to increase the numbers and competencies of leaders within the sector at both national and international level. * increasing the available human resource surge capacity to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies * strengthening humanitarian supply chain logistics systems to improve the efficiency of tracking the storage, transport and distribution of relief items. * establishing a system to collate and disseminate key lessons and good practice and integrate learning and evaluations into future strategic planning of the CBHA Category:Humanitarian aid organizations Category:Consortia in the United Kingdom ","title":"Consortium of British Humanitarian Agencies"},{"id":"26601726","title":"1981 in Japanese television"},{"id":"26601762","text":"A.M. Weather was an American weather news program that ran from October 30, 1978 to February 3, 1995. and was broadcast on PBS member stations throughout the United States. The 15-minute daily program, which aired fifteen minutes before or after the hour (depending on the station's scheduling of the program) and was produced by Maryland Public Television (MPT), featured detailed forecasts presented by meteorologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The program led the way in the use of computer graphics for televised weather reports, but had previously used hand- drawn maps and the show's trademark yellow pointer. Overview The show's progression usually started with a satellite and radar segment, followed by the current conditions around the U.S. (vice versa in early years), then the forecast (especially in terms of temperatures and precipitation), followed by an aviation forecast (locations of MVFR and IFR, aircraft icing, turbulence and winds aloft) and ended (when necessary) with an inclement weather report, called \\"WeatherWatch\\". The program aired its final edition on February 3, 1995; one of the reasons behind A.M. Weathers cancellation was that MPT wanted to expand on its morning business news enterprise with Bloomberg L.P. Hosts included NOAA meteorologists Carl Weiss, Joan von Ahn and Wayne Winston, as well as H. Michael Mogil, Rich Warren, Dale Bryan and Barry Richwein. Other notable substitute hosts included: Regis Walter, Steve Zubrick (now the president of the National Weather Association), Gary Petti (a meteorologist with National Weather Service and National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), now retired), and George Lessens (now the chief meteorologist at WZZM in Grand Rapids, Michigan). Funding was provided by various aviation-related companies and government agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (and its Air Safety Foundation arm), Phillips Petroleum Company, Gorman-Rupp pumps, Hilton Hotels Corporation, the National Business Aviation Association, Inc. (known at the time during the show's run as the National Business Aircraft Association), the Lawyer-Pilots Bar Association, Showalter Flying Services (a fixed-base operator in Orlando, Florida), Republic Airlines, and Beech Aircraft Corporation, Combs Gates, among others.

The book was published in 1975. It was the eighth novel in the series, though it is set earlier than the others, at the start of the career of Richard Bolitho. Plot The book opens with Richard Bolitho arriving at a Portsmouth inn frequented by midshipmen. There he meets another midshipman, Martyn Dancer. A lieutenant recalls them to their ship, HMS Gorgon, a 74-gun ship of the line. Sailing towards West Africa, they encounter an empty merchantman, City of Athens. Dancer and Bolitho are sent aboard the ship and discover that it has been pillaged and the crew killed. The officers soon deduce that the ship was raided by pirates and Captain Conway announces that the Admiralty had dispatched them to investigate the disappearance of ships in the region. In company with the captured City of Athens, Gorgon approaches a coastal fort surrounded by treacherous reefs and shoals. They sight two ships in the nearby harbour. The fort then opens fire and disables City of Athens. Gorgon withdraws and returns after dark to salvage the ship. Dancer and Bolitho are sent on the mission, commanded by the 4th lieutenant, Mr. Tregorren, who holds a grudge against Bolitho's prestigious heritage. They succeed at taking the ship, and also capture a slave dhow in the escape, with the help of Gorgon. The ships, under the guise of being members of the pirate fleet, raid the castle which the pirates had been using as a base.

Dubbed \\"the Great Settlement\\" by Spanish explorers who visited the site, Etzanoa may have housed 20,000 Wichita people. The historical city is considered part of Quivira. Francisco Vásquez de Coronado visited central Kansas in 1541 and dubbed the Wichita settlements \\"Quivira\\". The Umana and Leyba expedition visited the Etzanoa site in 1594 and Juan de Oñate visited there in 1601. They recorded the inhabitants as being the Rayados. \\"Rayados\\" in Spanish means \\"striped.\\" The Wichita people were noted for the straight lines they tattooed onto their faces and their bodies. In April 2017, the location of Etzanoa was finally discovered when a local teen found a cannonball linked to a battle near present-day Arkansas City that took place in the year 1601. Local researchers used this artifact to pinpoint the location of Etzanoa.Teen accidentally helps discover lost 16th-century civilization in Kansas By Natalie O'Neill, NY Post, 18 April 2017. Archaeological research Wichita Indian village, with beehive-shaped grass houses surrounded by maize, that may be similar to those of Etzanoa Donald Blakeslee, an archaeologist at the Wichita State University, has led recent research on Etzanoa. In 2013, historians at the University of California, Berkeley, retranslated the early Spanish accounts of expeditions to Kansas. These clearer translations allowed Blakeslee to match written descriptions to archaeological sites. He located the 1601 Spanish battle site in Arkansas City. During road construction in the area in 1994, thousands of artifacts were unearthed. Residents of Arkansas City regularly unearthed artifacts, such as potsherds or flint points. Kansas State Archaeologist Robert Hoard is researching sites in Rice and McPherson Counties. Archaeologists have discovered more than a dozen large settlements along six miles of the Walnut River. These are called the Lower Walnut focus sites. The occupation of these sites has been dated from 1500 to 1720. Some artifacts of Spanish origin have been found at the site. The Rayados probably abandoned the Walnut River site in the early eighteenth century. Perhaps they moved a few miles south to Kay County, Oklahoma, where two 18th-century archaeological sites, Deer Creek and Bryson Paddock, of the Wichita are known.OAS – Oklahoma's Past . Ou.edu. Retrieved 3 April 2011. They appear to have been much reduced in numbers by then, possibly as a result of European diseases, warfare, and the slave trade in Indians. The descendants of the Rayados were absorbed into the Wichita tribe. A 2020 aerial investigation by Blakeslee discovered a probable Etzanoa ceremonial site near the previously-identified sites along the Walnut River, with its most prominent feature a circular or semi-circular ditch of two meters width and 50 meters in diameter.Survey Reveals Large Earthwork at Ancestral Wichita Site in Kansas. Heritage Daily, 4 September 2020.Drones Find Signs of Native American 'Great Settlement' under Kansas Pasture. Science News, 10 September 2020 Rayado Indians Most authorities agree that the Rayados were Caddoan speaking and members of a sub-tribe of the Wichita people. Their grass houses, dispersed mode of settlement, a chief named Catarax—a Wichita title—the description of their granaries, and their location all agree with descriptions of the Wichita. As Wichita, the Rayados were related to the people that Coronado had discovered in Quivira 60 years earlier.Hammond and Rey, 754. One scholar, however, dissents, calling them \\"Jumanos.\\"Hickerson, Nancy Parrott, The Jumanos: Hunters and Traders of the Southern Plains (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1994), 73. Jumano seems to have been a generic term for Plains Indians with painted or tattooed faces, as were the Rayados. Both Jusepe's and Onate's accounts describe the Rayados as numerous. The more than 1200 houses which Onate estimated for the settlement indicates a population of at least 12,000, if the houses were as large as those of later Wichita tribes.The Wichita Indians. Texasindians.com. Retrieved 3 April 2011. Moreover, Chief Catarax told the Spanish explorers that there were additional settlements upstream on that river and on other rivers.Bolton (1916), p. 271 The fact that the Rayados abandoned their settlement on the arrival of Onate's expedition may be an indication that they had had previous, and unfavorable, dealings with the Spanish. Spanish chronicles=Jusepe, 1594/95 In 1594 or 1595, Antonio Gutierrez de Umana and Francisco Leyba de Bonilla led the first known expedition to the Great Plains of Oklahoma and Kansas in more than 50 years. A Mexican Indian named Jusepe Gutierrez was the only known survivor of the expedition. Leaving New Mexico and traveling east and north for more than a month, Jusepe said that they found a \\"very large settlement.\\" He said it extended for more than 10 leagues (about 26 miles) along a river and was two leagues wide. The houses had straw roofs and were built close together, but between clusters of houses were fields of maize, squash, and beans. The Indians were numerous, but \\"received the Spanish peacefully and furnished them with abundant supplies of food\\" The expedition encountered a \\"multitude\\" of bison in the region.Hammond, George P and Rey, Agapito (eds.) Don Juan de Onate, Colonizer of New Mexico, 1595–1628, Vol. 5. Albuquerque: UNM Press, 1953, pp. 416–419 It appears these were the same people later called \\"Rayados.\\" Oñate, 1601 In 1601, Juan de Oñate, founder and governor of New Mexico, led an expedition that followed in the footsteps of Leyba and Umana. Jusepe guided Oñate, more than 70 Spanish soldiers and priests, an unknown number of Indian soldiers and servants, and 700 horses and mules across the plains.Bolton (1916), pp. 250–67. Oñate met Apache Indians in the Texas Panhandle and, later, a large encampment of Escanjaques. The Escanjaques showed him the way to a large settlement about 30 miles away of a people whom Oñate called \\"Rayados.\\" Rayado means \\"striped\\" in Spanish, referring to their custom of painting or tattooing their faces. The Escanjaques, enemies of the Rayados, attempted to enlist the help of the Spanish to attack the Rayados, who they alleged were responsible for the deaths of Leyba and Umana a few years earlier. The Escanjaques guided Oñate to a nearby river, probably the Arkansas, where they saw a few hundred Rayados on a hill. The Rayados advanced, throwing dirt into the air as a sign that they were ready for war. Oñate indicated that he did not wish to fight and made peace with the group, who proved to be friendly and generous. Oñate said that, unlike the Escanjaques, the Rayados were \\"united, peaceful, and settled.\\" They showed deference to their chief, named Catarax, whom Oñate detained as a guide and hostage, although \\"treating him well.\\" Catarax led Oñate and the Escanjaques across the Arkansas to a settlement on the eastern bank, a few miles from the river. The settlement was deserted, the inhabitants having fled. It contained \\"more than twelve hundred houses, all established along the bank of another good-sized river which flowed into the large one [probably the Arkansas].\\" The settlement of the Rayados was similar to those seen by Coronado in Quivira sixty years before. The homesteads were dispersed; the houses round, thatched with grass and surrounded by large granaries to store the corn, beans, and squash that they grew in their fields. Oñate restrained his Escanjaque guides from looting the town and sent them home. Catarax, who had been chained, was rescued by the Rayados in a bold raid. The next day Oñate and his army proceeded onward through the settlement for three leagues (eight miles) without seeing many Rayados. The Spaniards were warned, however, that the Rayados were assembling an army to attack them. Discretion seemed the better part of valor. Oñate estimated that three hundred Spanish soldiers would be needed to confront the Rayados, and he turned his soldiers around to return to New Mexico. Oñate feared a Rayados attack, but apparently it was the Escanjaques who attacked as they turned to New Mexico. Oñate claimed that many Escanjaques were killed in the battle, but many of his soldiers were wounded. After two hours, Oñate broke off the combat, retired from the field, and led his group to New Mexico. An Indian captured from the Escanjaques by Oñate, and later named Miguel, drew a map of the region for the Spanish. He called the \\"Great Settlement\\" of the Rayados, \\"Etzanoa\\" or \\"Tzanoa.\\" Tours Limited private tours of the site can be arranged through the Cherokee Strip Land Rush Museum in Arkansas City.

On 21 July, after shakedown exercises and eight days in drydock at the Norfolk Navy Yard, ATR-43 headed back to Key West. For the next 10 months, she operated in the Caribbean Sea and the south Atlantic. The tug visited Trinidad; Bermuda; and Recife and Belem, Brazil. She was redesignated ATA-121 on 15 May 1944. She departed Bermuda on 8 May 1945; transited the Panama Canal; and reached San Diego, California, on 1 June. On the 7th, she sailed, via Puget Sound and Pearl Harbor for the western Pacific.

On the 22nd, she entered Eniwetok Lagoon; and, the next day, she departed to tow YTL-550 to Kwajalein. She arrived at Kwajalein on 25 July and sailed for Pearl Harbor the following day. She made Pearl on 2 August and remained there until after Japan surrendered. The ship performed towing missions between Hawaii, the Marshall islands, and the Marianas through most of the autumn. Early in December, she departed Pearl Harbor and arrived at San Diego on the 17th. ATA-121 was decommissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 9 April 1946. 1951-1968 On 6 June 1951, she was recommissioned as Sotoyomo (ATA-121). Between 15 June 1951 and 25 June 1952, she operated in and around San Diego. She next made a voyage to Sasebo, Japan, via Pearl Harbor and Midway, and returned to San Diego on 15 March 1953. She again departed San Diego on 23 April, reached Pearl Harbor on 3 May, and entered the naval shipyard there for overhaul. On 8 July, she exited Pearl Harbor to return to the California coast and arrived at San Diego on the 18th. She remained there until 2 February 1954, when she got underway for Sasebo, Japan, via Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein. Returning via Midway and Pearl Harbor, Sotoyomo arrived in San Diego on 22 September. Decommissioning and sale In the spring of 1955, the ship returned to Astoria where she was decommissioned on 1 July. She was berthed in the Columbia River until her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1961. In June 1963, the ship was sold to the government of Mexico.

This estate of is well known for its rhododendrons, azaleas and magnolias, which were introduced and naturalized among local flora. The house and gardens, both dating from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries,Brown, Jane, Gardens of a Golden Afternoon, p163, Penguin, 1985 are a first-class example, unique in France, of the work of the famous English partnership of architect Edwin Lutyens and garden designer Gertrude Jekyll. A large park overlooking the sea and formal gardens surrounding a manor house, where the original owner's descendants still live, make up the Bois des Moutiers. The estate is listed as a historical monument Domaine du Bois des Moutiers and a Remarkable Garden of France.  History = Guillaume Mallet's aim  In 1897, Guillaume Mallet became the owner of a large valley overlooking the sea. He acquired the site while it was still wild, and over almost forty years he took great care to create a large park. In 1898 he entrusted Edwin Lutyens, a young British architect, with the enlargement and renovation of his residence and Gertrude Jekyll, a celebrated English garden designer, with the garden arrangement. These two artists acted as one to create a unified work: \\"the house has been designed to look at the gardens and the gardens have been designed to be looked at from the house\\".Antoine Bouchayer-Mallet, current owner of the Bois des Moutiers, in a TV report devoted to the estate and submitted by SeineMaritime.tv : la Seine Maritime en 16 secondes (in French)  Creation of the estate  The original, undistinguished house was built around 1850.Cresswell-Turner, Sebastian, \\"The making of Lutyens\\", Country Life, 25 March 2009, pp 48–53. Online pdf accessed 15 March 2011 It was later extended and substantially remodelled in the Arts-and-Crafts style by Edwin Lutyens. This style is characterized by a desire to recognise the importance of the materials, to create unique, relatively plain works, and above all by a reminder that craft deserves to be considered as a work of art. Consistent with this, the buildings of the Bois des Moutiers are conceived as a full-fledged work where every detail of wrought iron and woodwork has been taken care of during their creation. Unfortunately, occupying German troops removed all the iron door handles (by Morris & Co) during World War II. The Adoration of the Magi, a tapestry made by Morris & Co to a design of Edward Burne-Jones, was hidden during the war by the family, who eventually sold it to Yves St Laurent and Pierre Bergé. In 2009 Bergé donated it to the Musée d'Orsay. Many of the original Morris & Co furnishings of the house remain. Besides the entrance to each bedroom is a Pre-Raphaelite portrait in bas-relief on the wall, including one of Jane Morris. Enclosed areas... The gardens, seven in all, are enclosed areas (chambres verts – \\"green rooms\\" of plants) surrounding the house on the south and east sides. Gertrude Jekyll, their creator, mixed colours and scents together in order to design a unique atmosphere in each of them. The layout of the gardens relates closely to the rooms within the house; for example, the two stone seats set in niches in a yew hedge at the end of the White Garden mirror the arrangement of two small closets and a large mullioned window at the opposite end of the music room. Reflecting the Theosophist philosophy of Guillaume Mallet and his wife, Marie-Adélaïde Grunelius, \\"it was understood that the architecture and gardens should work together towards the harmonious development of the spirit.\\" The acidic soil and maritime climate are favourable for introducing species such as Himalayan rhododendrons and azaleas from China. Behind the house, beyond a wide lawn, Guillaume Mallet designed and planted a vast area, which stretches down to the sea cliffs, with a maze of winding paths through a dense woodland of native and exotic trees, sheltering an understorey of rhododendrons and azaleas, hydrangeas, Japanese maples, camellias and magnolias.Niermans, Marianne, \\"Le Bois des Moutiers: Un mer de rhododendrons\\", Point de Vue, 4 May 2010 Online pdf accessed 15 March 2011  Public opening  Guillaume Mallet and his wife Marie-Adelaïde died in 1946. Their son André and his wife Mary inherited the estate that had been badly damaged during the war. The whole family devoted their energies to restoring the estate to its original condition. In 1970, the Mallet family opened their property to the public. The Bois des Moutiers became the first private garden in France that could be visited by the public. Very soon, it was considered to be one of the most beautiful gardens of France and was listed as a historical monument in 1975 before being awarded the status of a \\"Remarkable Garden of France\\". Since its opening, two million people have visited this park. Visitor numbers have declined in the last few years and maintaining the estate has become increasingly difficult for Antoine Bouchayer-Mallet, the current owner, to manage. The inheritance laws of the Code Napoléon mean that ownership is now legally divided between 11 people (descendants of the original owners), and in the next generation there will be many more. So Bouchayer-Mallet has considered putting the estate up for sale, possibly through an English estate agency. It is uncertain that Bois des Moutiers will be open to the public in the future.

The line is the westernmost part of the railway line from Berlin to the Rhine that was proposed by Friedrich List in his Concept for a railway network in Germany, published in 1833. In fact, Friedrich Harkort (“father of the Ruhr”) had proposed the construction of a railway line from Cologne to Minden in 1825. History  On 18 December 1843, the CME was awarded the concession to build a railway line between the metropolis of Cologne, the cities of the Rhenish-Westphalian industrial area and Minden to connect with the network of the Royal Hanoverian State Railways. A route through the Bergisches Land had been dropped was due to the high cost of the engineering structures that would have been required on the advice of the Aachen merchant and banker David Hansemann (1790-1864), who was then briefly Prussian Minister of Finance. Instead, the chosen route that bypassed the Bergisches Landran was selected. It ran from Deutz (now a suburb of Cologne) further north through Mülheim am Rhein, Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Oberhausen, Altenessen, Gelsenkirchen, Wanne, Herne and Castrop-Rauxel to Dortmund and on to Hamm, Oelde, Rheda, Bielefeld and Herford to Minden. The first leg from Deutz to Düsseldorf opened on 20 December 1845. Only a few weeks later, on 9 February 1846, the second section was completed to a temporary terminus at the site of present-day Duisburg Hauptbahnhof called the Duisburg Cologne-Minden station, the first of three stations built on the same site. The next section from Duisburg to Hamm was opened on 15 May 1847. On 15 October 1847, the last section was opened to Minden, thus completing the entire 263 kilometre long, single track railway. The line with the Schildesche viaduct and other engineering structures were designed for eventual duplication. Network developments in 1847/48  Railway Map of Germany and neighboring countries in 1849. Thin lines represent lines that were projected or under construction. On the same day as its line opened to Minden, the Royal Hanoverian State Railways opened its Hanover–Minden line. On 1 September 1847 the Saxon-Silesian Railway Company opened a line connecting Görlitz with a branch of the Lower Silesian-Markish Railway. On 18 October 1847 the Upper Silesian Railway reached the border station of Mysłowice. On 13 October 1847 Kraków-Upper Silesian Railway opened. The opening of several hundred kilometres of railway lines in September and October 1847 together with other lines opened in the previous few years, created a continuous rail link from the Rhine via Brunswick, Oschersleben, Magdeburg, Dresden and Wrocław to the Vistula river. The lines from Berlin to Magdeburg and Wrocław were opened in the previous year, but until 1851 there was no rail connection between the various railway stations in Berlin. With the opening of a connecting line between the Wrocław stations on 3 February 1848, it was connected to the Upper Silesian Railway and the Kraków–Upper Silesian railway, creating a continuous rail link from Deutz to Kraków. Less than a year later on 1 September 1848, the William Railway (Wilhelmsbahn) was opened from Koźle to Bohumín (now in the Czech Republic, then in the Austrian Empire), closing the gap between the Upper Silesian Railway and the Austrian Northern Railway, which had opened to Bohumín on 1 April 1847. This created a continuous rail link between Cologne and Vienna. Current significance  In modern times the trunk line is no longer a continuous main line. The section between Duisburg and Dortmund is not a regular route for long-distance trains; instead through trains run on the more central Witten/Dortmund–Oberhausen/Duisburg line of the former Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company. The line is now treated as four different lines as set out below with their current significance in terms of the number of trains running: *Cologne–Duisburg line (extremely high) *Duisburg–Dortmund line (Duisburg–Oberhausen and Gelsenkirchen–Wanne-Eickel: medium, otherwise low) *Dortmund–Hamm line (high) * Hamm–Minden line (very high) Category:Railway lines in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Railway lines opened in 1845 Category:1845 establishments in Prussia ","title":"Cologne-Minden trunk line"},{"id":"26602174","text":"Bandian Hallway The Bandian Fire Temple () is an archaeological site in Dargaz County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran, near the medieval city Abiward. The primary excavations were carried out to reveal precious remains of art and architecture of the pre-Islamic Iran, dating from the Sassanian period (224-651 AD) when the archaeological significance of Bandian was recognized. Found at the site, near the town of Dargaz were a stucco-decorated hall with columns, Sassanian Pahlavi inscriptions, and at last the some remains of brick architecture, which are considered to be one of the most invaluable finds of that period. Additionally, the excavations yielded a Zoroastrian sanctuary, with a substantial amount of its decoration and design features undamaged. while the upper parts of the stucco reliefs were not preserved, but a good deal had remained in place (info from Bandian of Daregaz). Throughout six seasons of the site's excavations, the building's central part was found; its main hall, measuring 10.25x8.45 m, as well as a number of rooms and corridors were unearthed. The hall had four lime columns that supported the flat ceiling of the structure. The columns' strengthening structure is quite interesting. Another outstanding facet of the building is its mihrab (arched niche) in about 2.80x1.70 m. The large hall features extensive stucco reliefs, depicting scenes of a hunt, battle, triumph, ritual, investiture, and banquet. It contains depictions of Persian victories in the Hephthalite–Persian Wars.https://iranatlas.info/atashkade/atashkade52.htm The complex has been dated to the reign of Peroz (459-484 CE) or his son Kavad I (488-497 CE).

Status The first station, the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS), began operation in 2000 on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic. The second station, the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS), began operation in 2002 in southern Utah. Stations to be built in Europe (European Mars Analog Research Station / EuroMARS) and Australia (Australia Mars Analog Research Station / MARS-Oz) have not progressed beyond the planning stages. EuroMARS was planned for deployment in Iceland. A structure for EuroMARS was built, but placed in storage for several years due to lack of funding to ship to the Society's UK headquarters, and from there on to Iceland. During storage and shipping the structure was damaged beyond repair, so now the European chapters of the Mars Society are seeking funding to build a new habitat. The fourth station, MARS- Oz, has been designed, but lacks funding for construction. Mars Desert Research Station Each of the MARS research centers comprises a prototype of the Mars Habitat Unit of the kind advocated in the Mars Direct and NASA Mars Design Reference Mission for sending human crews to Mars. These are multi-deck units, providing a combination of living and working space for crews of up to six people at a time. Each unit is approximately in diameter and stands in height, offering either two or three decks of interior living and working space. Layout The Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) and the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) are two-deck units, designed around a common layout. The upper deck is divided into two halves: one is given over to six individual sleeping cabins that provide visiting crew members with a bed, personal storage space and privacy when they need it. The other half of the upper deck is devoted to a common work area / dining area / food preparation area. In the ceiling space above this is the unit's large water tank, containing all of the habitat's usable water (this is resupplied from an additional tank outside the unit. However, on a real mission, the water would be recycled after use, and possibly augmented by water obtained via extraction from the Martian permafrost). The lower deck contains an open-plan work area where a variety of science and engineering tasks can be performed. It also contains the main hygiene area (toilet, washbasin and shower), and contains the main power distribution system for the habitat and the heating system. Heat and power are supplied by external generators, but on a real mission to Mars they would most likely be supplied using a combination of nuclear and possibly solar power. However, due to the extremes of dust contamination, solar panels will not supply sufficient energy to power a Habitat on Mars on their own. Also on the lower deck of the FMARS and MDRS are the airlocks and the Extra-vehicular Activity preparation room (EVA prep room). This is where crew members don and doff their simulated Mars spacesuits prior to leaving the Habitat Unit. Computer graphic of the European Mars Hab interior The European Mars Analog Research Station is slightly different from FMARS and MDRS in that it provides three decks: *The uppermost deck contains sleeping quarters for the 6-person crew, and storage space for on-board systems and / or additional equipment *The mid-deck provides a dedicated communications centre / solar storm shelter, a galley, exercise area, storage bins and a living / working area, and hygiene facilities *The lower deck provides two micro laboratories, a main repair / medical treatment area, 2 airlocks and an EVA prep area. The European unit has been deliberately designed for expansion - additional equipment and technology, such as water recycling systems, can be added to the unit as they become available. Operational goals The primary goal of the MARS programme is to research the operational environment of a base on Mars. As such, the programme is specifically geared towards answering a wide range of key questions about living and working on Mars, including: *What is the best number for an exploratory team on Mars - four people, six people, more? *How well do support systems and equipment function \\"in the field\\"? *What are the best designs for EVA suits? *How easy is it to maintain equipment in isolated conditions? *How are group dynamics going to operate in such a closed environment? In order to find answers to these and other questions, MARS teams will: *Perform a wide range of EVA and scientific experiments of the kind that will be performed on Mars *Test communications equipment, EVA suit designs, portable life support facilities and other elements crucial to a human expedition to Mars *Learn to conduct extended EVA sorties using vehicles such as unpressurised ATVs and analogues of pressurised rover vehicles that can operate away from the main base for days at a time *Find out the optimum means of carrying out surface investigations – how many people need to be on an EVA mission in order to make it effective, etc. In order to achieve these goals, operations at the Habitat Units are performed under \\"Mars simulation\\" conditions. This means that once a crew is in a unit, barring a serious medical event or emergency, they live and work as astronauts would on Mars: *They cannot leave the unit without donning a simulated space suit *They cannot communicate directly with anyone outside the unit without a built-in time delay in the communication - the distance between Earth and Mars makes direct conversation impossible *They can only use the equipment, tools and food available to them inside the habitat. Each crew spends between 2 weeks and a month living in a habitat unit, performing the kind of work astronauts will be expected to carry out on Mars: collecting rock samples from the surface and examining them back in the habitat; conducting life science experiments; studying the local geology and geomorphology, and so on.

He later led a consortium of investors who leased the theatre during a much longer second phase, after the property was revived by Richard Burbage and Cuthbert Burbage. Theatre historian David Grote describes Evans as an \\"unsavoury\\" and \\"devious\\" character who was not above kidnapping young boys to perform in his theatre. First Blackfriars In 1583 William Hunnis and John Newman transferred their sub-lease of property in the Blackfriars, which was being legally contested by the owner, Sir William More, to Evans. This was part of a complicated series of transactions apparently designed to ensure that the building could continue to be used as a theatre, something More was attempting to stop. Evans seems to have been working in alliance with John Lyly and his patron Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.Alan H. Nelson, Monstrous Adversary: The Life of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, Liverpool University Press, 2005, p.248. In 1584 More regained control of the building and stopped performances. In 1585 Evans was head of the Earl of Oxford's Boys at court.. It has been suggested that during this period Evans may have written the play the Famous Victories of Henry V, one of the principal models for Shakespeare's later plays on the life of Henry. However, the authorship of the play is uncertain.Scoufos, Alice-Lyle, Shakespeare's Typological Satire: A Study of the Falstaff-Oldcastle Problem, Ohio University Press, 1981, pp.176, 180 Second Blackfriars In partnership with musician Nathaniel Giles, Evans obtained the lease of the Blackfriars property for the second time in 1599, after the building had been acquired by James Burbage, father of Richard and Cuthbert. This helped the Burbages out of a problem, since after their father acquired it in 1596 wealthy local citizens had successfully petitioned to stop the building being used again as a theatre. In consequence, it had been left empty for several years. Evans intended to use it to support a company of boys, as he had before 1590. By installing child \\"choristers\\", and setting aside part of building for their education, Evans could claim that the theatre was legally a school: one in which plays happened to be performed.Brian Jaycorrigan, Playhouse Law in Shakespeare's World, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2004, p.72. Evans apparently supplemented his choristers by taking talented children from local grammar schools, which he could do because his business partner Nathaniel Giles, Hunnis's successor at the Chapel Royal, had a warrant to provide performers for the queen's entertainment. In 1600 the father of one child attempted to sue Evans for forcing his son to join the Blackfriars troupe. By April 1602 the business appears to have been in financial difficulty. Evans accepted a deal that he had backed out of a few months earlier, ceding half ownership of the company to three new partners, William Rastell, Edward Kirkham and Thomas Kendall. In return he received an injection of capital. When the plague struck in the following year, Evans tried to give up the lease, but the Burbages refused to release him from the contract.Grote, David, The Best Actors in the World: Shakespeare and His Acting Company, Greenwood, 2002, pp 101, 128, 171. He later ceded the remaining half ownership to three more partners, John Marston, William Strachey and his own wife. The company was later badly affected when in 1608 the French ambassador complained to King James I about productions of plays by George Chapman at Blackfriars in which the French court was allegedly treated with disrespect. The ambassador told James that there had also been a play in which James himself was portrayed as a drunk. Incensed, James ordered that the Blackfriars children should \\"never play more, but should first begg their bread\\". Evans was forced to turn the lease back to the Burbages later in 1608. They took it up for their own company, the King's Men.Roslyn L. Knutson, \\"Theater Companies and Stages\\" in Garrett A. Sullivan Jr.; Patrick Cheney et al., Early Modern English Drama: A Critical Companion, Oxford University Press, 2006, p.18. The deal involved Henry's relative Thomas Evans taking one share in the new partnership, the other six going to members of the King's Men, including the Burbages and Shakespeare. The transfer of the share to Thomas may have been related to the fact that after the end of the lease two of Evans' old partners engaged in a protracted lawsuit to recover money from him on the grounds that he had breached the agreement with them. Henry himself is listed as the sharer in later cases in 1610 and 1612. Significance In addition to his possible authorship of the Famous Victories Evans had an indirect influence on Shakespearean drama. His company of boys has often been seen as a rival to the King's Men, in part because of the apparent attacks on it in Hamlet. However, income from the 1599 lease helped to keep the Globe theatre afloat at a time when takings were limited and the Burbages were having to make hefty repayments on the loans they had taken out to build and maintain it. The Burbages appear to have trusted Evans despite the fact that the historical record indicates that he \\"was devious or incompetent even by Elizabethan standards\\". When Evans finally gave up the lease, and the King's Men moved into Blackfriars, Shakespeare's plays start to undergo significant changes in their structure and style, apparently adapting to the new, more select, audience and the indoor theatre.

It is directed against the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha. It was removed from the United States and European Union markets in 2019, due to insufficient proof of its medical advantage (see below \\"Medical uses\\").  Medical uses  Olaratumab is used in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) who cannot be cured by cancer surgery or radiation therapy, and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin. In a randomised controlled trial with 133 STS patients, olaratumab plus doxorubicin improved the median of progression- free survival from 4.1 to 6.6 months as compared to doxorubicin alone (p = 0.0615, narrowly missing statistical significance), and overall survival from 14.7 to 26.5 months (p = 0.0003, highly significant). However, the ANNOUNCE phase 3 trial did not find any advantage in adding olaratumab to doxorubicin. Therefore, in January 2019, FDA and EMA decided to recommend against starting olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma. In April 2019 the European Medicines Agency explicitly requested the marketing authorisation of the medicine to be revoked. Shortly afterwards the German Physician's Medicines Commission reported that olaratumab will be removed from the German market \\"in a few weeks\\" and asked doctors not to treat new patients with this drug outside of clinical trials. Lilly subsequently voluntarily withdrew its approval in the United States.  Contraindications  The drug has no contraindications apart from hypersensitivity reactions.  Side effects  In studies, the most serious side effects of the combination olaratumab/doxorubicin were neutropenia (low count of neutrophil white blood cells) with a severity of grade 3 or 4 in 55% of patients, and musculoskeletal pain grade 3 or 4 in 8% of patients. Common milder side effects were lymphopenia, headache, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, mucositis, and reactions at the infusion site; all typical effects of cancer therapies.  Interactions  No pharmacokinetic interactions with doxorubicin were observed in studies. Being a monoclonal antibody, olaratumab is neither metabolised by cytochrome P450 liver enzymes nor transported by transmembrane pumps, and is thus not expected to interact relevantly with other drugs.  Pharmacology = Mechanism of action  Olaratumab inhibits growth of tumour cells by blocking subunit alpha of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, a type of tyrosine kinase.  Pharmacokinetics  After intravenous infusion, olaratumab has a volume of distribution of 7.7 litres in steady state and a biological half-life of 11 days.  History  Olaratumab was originally developed by ImClone Systems, which was acquired by Eli Lilly in 2008. A Phase I clinical trial was conducted in Japanese patients in September 2010, followed by a Phase II trial in 133 patients, starting in October 2010. In February 2015, the European Medicines Agency assigned olaratumab orphan drug status for the treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma. The European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorisation, based on the mentioned Phase II study, valid throughout the European Union on 9 November 2016. Previously considered a promising drug, the FDA granted olaratumab fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review status. In October 2016, the US FDA issued an accelerated approval notice for use of olaratumab with doxorubicin to treat adults with certain types of soft-tissue sarcoma, based on the same study. A Phase III trial completed in 2019, and unfortunately showed no benefit from the addition of olaratumab to doxorubicin. As noted above, these results led to withdrawal of approval in the United States and Europe.

She was bought from a commercial builder during the early years of the American War of Independence, and went on to support operations in the English Channel and the Caribbean. At one stage she assisted an attack on a French-held island, an expedition commanded by a young Horatio Nelson. Laid up for a time after the end of the American War of Independence, she returned to service shortly before the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Drake spent most of her time in Caribbean waters, until being declared unfit for service in 1800 and deleted from the navy lists. Construction and commissioning Drake was built by Henry Ladd, of Dover and purchased while on the stocks as a cutter in March 1779.Ships of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.102 She was registered and established as a sloop on 19 March 1779, and launched in May that year, having commissioned in March under Commander William Brown. After being launched she was sailed to Deptford where she was fitted and coppered between 22 May and 19 July 1779 for the sum of £1,797 17s 6d. American War of Independence Drake was initially assigned to Admiral Sir Charles Hardy's fleet during the invasion crisis in 1779, and after the crisis had passed, went out to the Leeward Islands in February 1780. Commander Richard Curgenven succeeded Brown in April 1781, and in December that year command passed to Commander Charles Dixon. Dixon took Drake back to England, where she was refitted between April and June 1782 for the sum of £1,595 5s 4d. She then returned to the West Indies. In early March 1783, Captain James King of the frigate fell in with the frigates (under the command of Captain Horatio Nelson) and , and the brigs Drake and Barrington (or Admiral Barrington). From here on accounts diverge. ;Schomberg's account King decided, on the basis of the information he had gathered from a French frigate that he had captured on 2 March, to capture Turk's Island. The British landed some 350 seamen and marines under the command of Dixon, while the two brigs positioned themselves to cover the landing and fire on the town if necessary. However, two shore batteries (one of four 24-pounder guns and one of five 6-pounder guns) that the British had not expected opened fire on the brigs. Their fire wounded seven men on Drake and two on Barrington. and forced the two brigs to withdraw. At the same time Dixon ran into a well-entrenched French force that outnumbered his landing party. He was able to extricate his force without casualties. King contemplated a second attack with the frigates, but the winds were not favorable and ultimately the British squadron withdrew.Schomberg (1802), Vol. 2, pp.136-7. ;Nelson's account Nelson in his letter of 9 March 1783, reports that he was in command of the squadron and the operation. The squadron also included Coquette, a French frigate prize to Resistance, that remained out of the action. Shortly after the squadron arrived at Turk's Island, Tartar left without explanation. Nelson states that he sent Dixon under a flag of truce to ask the French commander to surrender; he refused. The British then landed 167 troops, under Dixon. Unexpectedly, a shore battery of three guns opened fire on the brigs. Drakes master was wounded, as were some seven men aboard the General Barrington. Dixon reported that seamen were manning the French guns and that the French troops had several field pieces. Nelson then decided to withdraw.Nelson (1845), Vol. 1, pp.72-3. Interwar years and French Revolutionary Wars With the conclusion of the American War of Independence Drake was paid off in July 1783 to ordinary at Sheerness. She underwent repairs and a refit at Sheerness for £2,981 between October 1787 and December 1788, recommissioning in November 1788 under Commander Jeremiah Beale. Drake was initially assigned to operate in the English Channel, at first under Beale, then from November 1789 under Commander George Countess, and from January 1791 under Commander John Dowling. She passed under Commander Samuel Brooking in December 1793, and went out to Jamaica in May 1795.National Maritime Museum Portrait of Captain Brooking Commander Thomas Gott succeeded Brooking in October 1796, and in turn Commander John Perkins succeeded Gott in 1797.National Archives, Kew: ADM 36/14999 Admiralty: Royal Navy Ships' Musters (Series I) 1795 May - 1798 Aug HMS Drake On 20 April 1797 Drake formed part of a squadron under Captain Hugh Pigot, consisting of the 32-gun frigates , and , and the cutter . The squadron cut out nine ships at Jean-Rabel without suffering any casualties.Clowes (1893-1903), pp.334-5.James (1837), Vol. 2, p.100-1. On 17 September, engaged the French schooner Trompeuse, of twelve 6-pounder guns and 78 crew. During the engagement Trompeuse blew up, though boats from Pelican were able to rescue 60 of the crew. During the chase and engagement, Drake was inshore of Pelican and sailed to cut Trompeuse off from taking refuge in Jean-Rabel. Pelican lost one man killed and had five men wounded but Drake apparently was not exposed to hostile fire and so did not suffer any casualties. On 25 October 1798 Drake captured the French privateer Favorite. In Drake Perkins, in company with , Captain Poyntz, shared in the capture of four French corvettes on 24 November 1799 off Cape Tiburon. All four were sailing from Cape François to Jacquemel. Solebay captured Egyptienne, which was of 300 tons burthen, was armed with 18 guns and had a crew of 140 men. One of the vessels was the 16 or 18-gun Eole, which the British took into service as .Winfield (2008), p.267. A third vessel was the 12-gun Sarier. The fourth was the 8-gun Vengeur, the former Royal Navy schooner . Fate Drake continued in the navy until being deleted from the lists by Admiralty order on 3 July 1800. She was subsequently condemned at Jamaica as unfit for service.Winfield (2008), p.278. Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References * *Clowes, W. Laird, et al.

Life and career Mantarō J. Hashimoto was born in Sawano-mura (沢野村), Nitta District, Gunma (currently Ōta City). In 1955, he received a BA in Chinese Literature from the University of Tokyo, and began graduate studies, but dropped out of the doctoral course in 1960. He obtained a PhD in Linguistics from Ohio State University in 1965, and his dissertation was on the Phonology of ancient Chinese. From 1966 to 1969, he was a visiting professor at the University of Hawaii, Osaka City University, and Princeton University. Hashimoto became an Assistant Professor at the Institute for Asian and African Languages and Cultures, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies in 1970 and Professor in 1973, where he remained for the rest of his life. Mantarō Hashimoto was married to Anne Oi-kan Yue-Hashimoto, who is currently Professor Emeritus of Chinese Language and Linguistics at the University of Washington. In 2002, the International Association of Chinese Linguistics established the Mantarō J. Hashimoto Award for Chinese Historical Phonology. Hashimoto and his research are still mentioned internationally among East Asian linguists (JCIEA 2011: 80). According to one prominent linguist of Chinese, Hashimoto blazed the trail for two fields of research: the effect that geography has on historical linguistics, and how areal features in the varieties of Chinese (previously called \\"dialects\\") reflect prolonged language contact with other language families (Wang 1987: 378). Professor Hashimoto was a leading advocate of studying different areal features to gain information on the historical development of the Chinese language. He analyzed the Chinese varieties in northern and southern China and noticed the further north one traveled in China, the more the Chinese varieties began to resemble the Altaic languages that bordered them. Conversely, as one traveled south in China, the varieties began to resemble Austroasiatic languages that bordered them in the south. Hashimoto theorized that the varieties of Chinese had been heavily influenced by the non-Chinese languages on their periphery (Wadley 1996: 99-100). For examples, northern varieties have comparatively fewer tonal distinctions and more polysyllabic words than southern Chinese varieties with complex tonal systems and more monosyllabic words. The syntax of sentence structure is frequently subject–object–verb in northern varieties and subject–verb–object in southern ones. Grammatical modifiers contrast between to modifier-modified word order in the north and modified-modifier in the south (Wadley 1996: 102). Selected works The polyglot Mantarō Hashimoto was a prolific writer of scholarly publications in Japanese, English, and Chinese (see Tsuji 1988 for details). His subjects included phonology, lexicology, dialectology, Sinitic languages, Hakka Chinese, Taiwanese Hokkien, and the influence of Altaic languages on Mandarin Chinese.

It is a successor to Perth City Hall and like sister venue Perth Theatre is leased to charitable organisation Horsecross Arts Limited by Perth & Kinross Council. The building was opened by Her Majesty Elizabeth II in 2005.  History  Perth Concert Hall opened its doors in September 2005 with a weekend of signature events giving a flavour of what was to come. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra represented the classical strand. Legendary percussionist Trilok Gurtu with an ensemble of Perthshire musicians heralded our Home+Away strand of world-traditional combos and Belle & Sebastian flew the flag for top of the range contemporary music. Before work began on the new Concert Hall, an archaeological dig was carried out. The dig uncovered evidence of a medieval castle, first documented in the 12th century but destroyed by flood in 1209. Other finds included an arched stone bridge, metal objects, leather, wood, pottery, stone and bones, clay-lined tanning pits and stone-lined wells. A series of burials identified a chapel dedicated to St Laurence. This was first mentioned in 1328, and was given to the Dominican friars in 1405. Until the dig, no archaeological evidence of the castle or chapel had existed. The neighbourhood down the centuries 12th century Castle 13th century Dominican friary 14th century Industrial suburb 17th century Horse market 18th century Tanning activity 19th–20th century Pullars dye works  Architecture  The contract was the result of the Perth 2000 international architectural competition, the jury of which was chaired by Eva Jiricna, and won by BDP Glasgow in 1998. The project started on site in 2003 and completed in Summer 2005 at a construction cost of £12.5m.  Auditorium  At the heart of the Perth Concert Hall building BDP has designed a fully flexible 1,200 seat concert hall, the Gannochy Auditorium, which features uniquely configured floor lifts and movable seating wagons to provide both raked seating and a large-scale flat floor. The flexible format of the concert hall can also accommodate events such as conference, sports, fashion shows, dinner dances and even a motor show. BDP Acoustics modeled the main auditorium's natural acoustic for orchestral music, with flexibility for a range of acoustic environments provided by retractable acoustic banners and powerful electro- acoustic systems. Commissioning reports confirm that the auditorium is an excellent venue for music events or speech. It won the Scottish Design Awards for Best Building for Public Use 2007.  Performance spaces and facilities  The Main Auditorium is a truly flexible facility - offering a wide range of layouts for conferences and events as its unique design means that part of the seating can disappear to create a flat floor ideal for cabaret style conferences, banquets, exhibitions and dinner dances. Standard performances can seat 1200 and standing performances up to 1600. Other spaces in the hall include the Norie-Miller Suite which can accommodate 120 people, or be split into two rooms at 50 and 60. There are also a number of meeting rooms and break-out spaces.  Notable events  A primary feature of its yearly program includes the 'Perth Concert Series of Scottish Orchestras'. As well as classical music, the hall plays host to opera and ballet, musical theatre, talks, rock and pop, folk, world and country, swing and comedy. It is also the main venue for the Southern Fried Festival. It has held numerous political party conferences, including the Scottish National Party, Scottish Conservatives and Scottish Labour  References  External links  * Category:Buildings and structures in Perth, Scotland Category:Concert halls in Scotland Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2005 ","title":"Perth Concert Hall (Scotland)"},{"id":"26602867","text":"Des Moines River Bridge may refer to: *Des Moines River Bridge (Humboldt, Iowa), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Humboldt County, Iowa *Des Moines River Bridge (Swea City, Iowa), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Kossuth County, Iowa ","title":"Des Moines River Bridge"},{"id":"26602873","text":"Raimon Carrasco Azemar (born February 17, 1924) is a Spanish businessman and former president of FC Barcelona.

She was the third Navy ship to bear the name \\"Sonoma\\", which is of American-Indian origin, in accordance with the Navy's naming convention for tugs. The tug was laid down on 9 December 1943 by the Levingston Shipbuilding Co., Orange, Texas, as the rescue tug, ATR-102; launched on 29 January 1944; reclassified an auxiliary ocean tug, ATA-175, on 13 April 1944; and commissioned on 3 August 1944. Following shakedown training in August, USS ATA-175 joined the Service Force, Atlantic Fleet in September. However, by 1 October, she was in the South Pacific at Bora Bora in the Society Islands. After almost a month of in-port operations, the tug departed Bora Bora on 29 October; stopped at Guadalcanal from 16 to 20 November; and arrived in Seeadler Harbor, Manus, on the 26th. For the remainder of 1944, ATA-175 operated in the vicinity of New Guinea and the Admiralty Islands, making two visits to Milne Bay, New Guinea, and one to Cairns, Australia. On 31 December, she stood out of Milne Bay for Hollandia, New Guinea, where she arrived on 7 January 1945. For the next seven months, she operated from Hollandia towing barges and other craft to various American bases in the western and southern Pacific. She made four voyages to Leyte in the Philippines and one each to Mackay, Australia, and Manus Island. On her first voyage to Leyte in late January and early February, the tug also visited Lingayen Gulf and Subic Bay. In June and July, she participated in post- landing operations at Morotai by towing three LSTs clear of the beach. She returned to Hollandia on 16 July and commenced 10 days overhaul at the Destroyer Repair Base. On the 29th, she set out on the fourth voyage from Hollandia to Leyte. For the rest of 1945, ATA-175 conducted operations in the Philippines. From 24 to 28 August, she assisted SS Alice N. RiceLiberty ship SS Alice H. Rice ? in clearing Kinabakagan Reef and damaged her rudder in the process. After repairs at Subic Bay, she resumed towing operations between the islands of the Philippine Archipelago. On 25 and 26 October, the tug participated in the salvage of SS Ralph W. EmersonLiberty ship SS Ralph Waldo Emerson ? which had run aground on a mud shoal in Davao Gulf off Mindanao. During her assignment in the Philippines, she also visited Samar Island and the city of Manila. In January 1946, ATA-175 returned to the United States for inactivation. On 7 June, she joined the 19th Fleet at Columbia River, Washington; and, on 8 November, she was placed out of commission. On 16 July 1948, ATA-175 was named Sonoma. In August 1960, custody of Sonoma was transferred to the Maritime Administration. She was laid up at Olympia, Washington, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1962. On 18 June 1971, she was briefly reacquired by the Navy for tow to Suisun Bay, California, where she was returned to the custody of the Maritime Administration. On 13 April 1976, Sonoma was sold to Erato Shipping & Trading Corp., and renamed Deka Epta. The ship was sold for scrapping in 1989.

This includes packaging materials, packaging components, primary packages, shipping containers, and unit loads, as well as the associated processes. Testing measures the effects and interactions of the levels of packaging, the package contents, external forces, and end-use. It can involve controlled laboratory experiments, subjective evaluations by people, or field testing. Documentation is important: formal test method, test report, photographs, video, etc. Testing can be a qualitative or quantitative procedure. Package testing is often a physical test. With some types of packaging such as food and pharmaceuticals, chemical tests are conducted to determine suitability of food contact materials. Testing programs range from simple tests with little replication to more thorough experimental designs. Package testing can extend for the full life cycle. Packages can be tested for their ability to be recycled and their ability to degrade as surface litter, in a sealed landfill or under composting conditions.ASTM D6954 Standard Guide for Exposing and Testing Plastics that Degrade in the Environment by a Combination of Oxidation and Biodegradation  Purposes  Packaging testing might have a variety of purposes, such as: * Determine if, or verify that, the requirements of a specification, regulation, or contract are met * Decide if a new product development program is on track: Demonstrate proof of concept * Provide standard data for other scientific, engineering, and quality assurance functions * Validate suitability for end-use * Provide a basis for technical communication * Provide a technical means of comparison of several options * Provide evidence in legal proceedings: product liability, patents, product claims, etc. * Help solve problems with current packaging * Help identify potential cost savings in packaging Packaging tests can be used for: * Subjecting packages (and contents) to stresses and dynamics found in the field * Reproducing the types of damage to packages and contents found in actual shipments * Controlling the uniformity of production of packages or components  Importance of testing  Testing the ability of packages to resist insect infestation For some types of products, package testing is mandated by regulations: food. pharmaceuticals, medical devices, dangerous goods, etc. This may cover both the design qualification, periodic retesting, and control of the packaging processes. Processes may be controlled by a variety of quality management systems such as HACCP, statistical process control, validation protocols, ISO 9000, etc. For unregulated products, testing can be required by a contract or governing specification. The degree of package testing can often be a business decision. Risk management may involve factors such as * costs of packaging * costs of package testing * value of contents being shipped * value of customer's good will * product liability exposure * other potential costs of inadequate packaging * etc. With distribution packaging, one vital packaging development consideration is to determine if a packaged-product is likely to be damaged in the process of getting to the final customer. A primary purpose of a package is to ensure the safety of a product during transportation and storage. If a product is damaged during this process, then the package has failed to accomplish a primary objective and the customer will either return the product or be unlikely to purchase the product altogether. Package testing is often a formal part of Project management programs. Packages are usually tested when there is a new packaging design, a revision to a current design, a change in packaging material, and various other reasons. Testing a new packaging design before full scale manufacturing can save time and money.  Laboratory affiliation  Many suppliers or vendors offer limited material and package testing as a free service to customers. It is common for packagers to partner with reputable suppliers: Many suppliers have certified quality management systems such as ISO 9000 or allow customers to conduct technical and quality audits. Data from testing is commonly shared. There is sometimes a risk that supplier testing may tend to be self-serving and not completely impartial. Large companies often have their own packaging staff and a package testing and development laboratory. Corporate engineers know their products, manufacturing capabilities, logistics system, and their customers best. Cost reduction of existing products and cost avoidance for new products have been documented. Another option is to use a paid consultant, Independent contractor, and third-party independent testing laboratory. They are commonly chosen for specialized expertise, for access to certain test equipment, for surge projects, or where independent testing is otherwise required. Many have certifications and accreditations: ISO 9000, ISO/IEC 17025, and various governing agencies.  Procedures  Several standards organizations publish test methods for package testing. Included are: * International Organization for Standardization, ISO * ASTM International * European Committee for Standardization. CEN * TAPPI * Military Standards * ISTA (International Safe Transit Association) * etc. Governments and regulators publish some packaging test methods. There are also many corporate test standards in use. A review of technical literature and patents provides good options to consider for test procedures. Researchers are not restricted to the use of published standards but can modify existing test methods or develop procedures specific to their particular needs. If a test is conducted with a deviation from a published test method or if a new method is employed, the test report must fully disclose the procedure.  Materials testing  Materials and components are often evaluated on a universal testing machine The basis of packaging design and performance is the component materials. The physical properties, and sometimes chemical properties, of the materials need to be communicated to packaging engineers to aid in the design process. Suppliers publish data sheets and other technical communications that include the typical or average relevant physical properties and the test method these are based upon. Sometimes these are adequate. Other times, additional material and component testing is required by the packager or supplier to better define certain characteristics. When a final package design is complete, the specifications for the component materials needs to be communicated to suppliers. Packaging materials testing is often needed to identify the critical material characteristics and engineering tolerances. These are used to prepare and enforce specifications. For example, shrink film data might include: tensile strength (MD and CD), elongation, Elastic modulus, surface energy, thickness, Moisture vapor transmission rate, Oxygen transmission rate, heat seal strength, heat sealing conditions, heat shrinking conditions, etc. Average and process capability are often provided. The chemical properties related for use as Food contact materials may be necessary.  Testing with people  Some types of package testing do not use scientific instruments but use people for the evaluation. The regulations for child-resistant packaging require a test protocol that involves children. Samples of the test packages are given to a prescribed population of children. With specified 50-child panels, a high percentage must be unable to open a test package within 5 minutes. Adults are also tested for their ability to open a child-resistant package. Consumer packages are often evaluated by focus groups. People evaluate the package features in a room monitored by video cameras. The consumer responses are treated qualitatively for feedback into the new packaging process. Some food packagers use organoleptic evaluations. People use their senses (taste, smell, etc.) to determine if a package component has tainted the food in the package. A new package may be evaluated in a test market that uses people to try the packages at home. Consumers have the opportunity to buy a product, perhaps with a coupon or discount. Return postcards or Internet sites provide feedback to package developers. Perhaps the most critical feedback is repeated sales items in the new package. Packaging evaluations are an important part of marketing research. Legibility of text on packaging and labels is always subjective due to the inherent variations of people. Efforts have been made to help better quantify this by people in a laboratory: still using people for the evaluation but also employing a test apparatus to help reduce variability.ASTM D7298 Some laboratory tests are conducted but still result in an observation by people. Some test procedures call for a judgment by test engineers whether or not pre- established acceptance criteria have been met.

The measured performance of many packages is affected by the conditioning and testing atmospheres. For example, paper based products are strongly affected by their moisture content: Relative humidity needs to be controlled. Plastic products are often strongly affected by temperature. Conditions of 23 °C (73.4 °F) and 50% relative humidity are common but other standard testing conditions are also published in material and package test standards. Engineering tolerances for the conditions are also specified. Often the package is conditioned to the specified environment and tested under those conditions. This can be in a conditioned room or in a chamber enclosing the test. With some testing, the package is conditioned to a specified environment, then is removed to ambient conditions and quickly tested. The test report needs to state the actual conditions used. Engineers have found it important to know the effects of the full range of expected conditions on package performance. This can be through investigating published technical literature, obtaining supplier documentation, or by conducting controlled tests at diverse conditions.  Relevant Standards  :ASTM D4332- Standard Practice for Conditioning Containers, Packages, or Packaging Components for Testing :ASTM E171- Standard Specification for Standard Atmospheres for Conditioning and Testing Flexible Barrier Materials :ASTM F2825 Standard Practice for Climate Stressing of Packaging Systems for Single Parcel Delivery  Degradation of product  Heat sealer used to prepare bag of lettuce for shelf life testing Laboratory tests can help determine the shelf life of a package and its contents under a variety of conditions. This is particularly important for foods, pharmaceuticals, some chemicals, and a variety of products. The testing is usually product specific: the mechanisms of degradation are often different. Exposures to expected and elevated temperatures and humidities are commonly used for shelf life testing. The ability of packaging to control product degradation is frequently a subject of laboratory and field evaluations.  Relevant tests  :ASTM E2454 Standard Guide for Sensory Evaluation Methods to Determine the Sensory Shelf -life of Consumer Products :DoD 4140.27M Shelf Life Management Manual, 2000 :ISO 11987 Ophthalmic Optics, Contact Lenses, Determination of Shelf Life  Barrier Properties  Many products degrade with exposure to the atmosphere: foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, etc. The ability of a package to control the permeation and penetration of gasses is vital for many types of products. Tests are often conducted on the packaging materials but also on the completed packages, sometimes after being subjected to flexing, handling, vibration, or temperature.  Degradation of Packages  Packages can degrade with exposure to temperature, humidity, time, sterilization (steam, radiation, gas, etc.), sunlight, and other environmental factors. For some types of packaging, it is common to test for possible corrosion of metals, polymer degradation, and weather testing of polymers. Several types of accelerated aging of packaging and materials can be accomplished in a laboratory. Exposure to elevated temperatures accelerates some degradation mechanisms. An Arrhenius equation is often used to correlate certain chemical reactions at different temperatures, based on the proper choice of Q10 coefficients. As with any laboratory testing, validating field trials are important.

The ability of insulated shipping containers to protect their contents from exposure to temperature fluctuations can be measured in a laboratory. The testing can be of empty containers or of full containers with appropriate jell or ice packs, contents, etc. Ovens, freezers, and environmental chambers are commonly used for this and other types of packaging. Digital temperature data loggers are used to measure temperatures experienced in different distribution systems. This data is sometimes used to develop unique laboratory test methods for that distribution system.  Relevant tests  :ASTM D3103-Standard Test Method for Thermal Insulation Performance of Distribution Packages :ISTA 7E – Testing Standard for Thermal Transport Packaging Used in Parcel Delivery System Shipment Thermal shock Some packages, particularly glass, can be sensitive to sudden changes in temperature: Thermal shock.

Relevant tests :ASTM C149 -Standard Test Method for Thermal Shock Resistance of Glass Containers :MIL-STD-810G METHOD 503.5 Handles Package handles (and hand holes in packages) assist carrying and handling packages. Objective laboratory procedures are frequently used to help determine performance. Fixtured ‘’hands’’ of various designs are used to hold a handle (sometimes two handles for a box). Most common are “jerk testing’’ by modified drop test procedures or use of the constant pull rates of a universal testing machine. Other procedures use a static force by hanging a heavily loaded package for an extended time or even using a centrifuge.

Potential vibration damage may include: * fractures and fatigue damage * loose wires, screw caps, etc. * bruises on soft products (fruit, etc.) * surface abrasion * etc. The ability of a package to withstand these vibrations and to protect the contents can be measured by several laboratory test procedures. Some allow searching for the particular frequencies of vibration that have potential for damage. Modal testing methodologies are sometimes employed. Others use specified bands of random vibration to better represent complex vibrations measured in field studies of distribution environments.

It usually measures of the force required to crush a package, stack of packages, or a unit load. Packages can be empty or filled as for shipment. A force-deflection curve used to obtain the peak load or other desired points. Other tests use a constant load and measure the time to failure or to a critical deflection. Dynamic compression is sometimes tested by shock or impact testing with an additional load to crush the test package. Dynamic compression also takes place in stacked vibration testing.

More thorough validation may include evaluations after use (and abuse) testing such as sunlight, abrasion, impact, moisture, etc. Relevant tests :ISO/IEC 15426 Information technology - Automatic identification and data capture techniques - Bar code verifier conformance specification - Part 1: Linear symbols, Part 2: Two-dimensional symbols  Test Protocols for Shipping Containers  Shipping containers are often subjected to sequential tests involving a combination of individual test methods. A variety of standard test schedules or protocols are available for evaluating transport packaging. They are used to help determine the ability of complete and filled shipping containers to various types of logistics systems. Some test the general ruggedness of the shipping container while others have been shown to reproduce the types of damage encountered in distribution. Some base the type and severity of testing on formal studies of the distribution environment: instrumentation, data loggers, and observation. Test cycles with these documented elements better simulate parts of certain logistics shipping environments. :ASTM International ::ASTM D4169- Standard Practice for Performance Testing of Shipping Containers and Systems ::ASTM D7386- Standard Practice for Performance Testing of Packages for Single Parcel Delivery Systems. :ISO ::ISO 4180:2009 Packaging – Complete filled transport packages – General rules for the compilation of performance test schedules :International Safe Transit Association :: Procedure 1A: Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68 kg) or Less :: Procedure 1B: Packaged-Products weighing Over 150 lb (68 kg) :: Procedure 1C: Extended Testing for Individual Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68 kg) or Less :: Procedure 1D: Extended Testing for Individual Packaged-Products weighing Over 150 lb (68 kg) :: Procedure 1E: Unitized Loads :: Procedure 1G: Packaged- Products weighing 150 lb (68 kg) or Less (Random Vibration) :: Procedure 1H: Packaged-Products weighing Over 150 lb (68 kg) (Random Vibration) :: Procedure 2A: Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68 kg) or Less :: Procedure 2B: Packaged-Products weighing over 150 lb (68 kg) :: Procedure 2C: Furniture Packages :: Procedure 3A: Packaged-Products for Parcel Delivery System Shipments 70 kg (150 lb) or Less (standard, small, flat or elongated) :: Procedure 3B: Packaged-Products for Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipment :: Procedure 3E: Unitized Loads of Same Product :: Procedure 3F: Packaged Products for Distribution Center to Retail Outlet Shipment 100 lb (45 kg) :: Procedure 3H: Performance Test for Products or Packaged-Products in Mechanically Handled Bulk Transport Containers :: Project 3K: Fast Moving Consumer Goods for the European Retail Supply Chain :: Project 4AB: Enhanced Simulation Performance Tests (online test planner) :: 6-FEDEX-A: FedEx Procedures for Testing Packaged Products Weighing Up to 150 lbs :: 6-FEDEX-B: FedEx Procedures for Testing Packaged Products Weighing Over 150 lbs :: 6-SAMSCLUB, Packaged-Products for Sam’s Club® Distribution System Shipment :: Procedure 7D: Thermal Controlled Transport Packaging for Parcel Delivery System Shipment :: ISTA 7E: Testing Standard for Thermal Transport Packaging Used in Parcel Delivery System  Field trials  :Laboratory testing can often help identify shipping container constructions that, in general, should perform well in the field. Of course, laboratory tests cannot fully reproduce the full range of field hazards, their magnitudes, nor their frequency. Field experiments are often conducted to help validate the laboratory testing. :The advantage of laboratory testing is that it subjects replicate packages to identical sets of test sequences: a relatively small number of samples often can suffice. Field hazards, by their nature, are highly variable: thus repeated shipments do not receive the same types or magnitudes of drops, vibrations, kicks, impacts, abrasion, etc. Because of this uncontrolled variability, more replicate sample shipments are often necessary. :Larger scale test markets are used to give additional assurance of performance and acceptability for a new or revised packaged-product. Feedback is carefully obtained and evaluated. Feedback on package performance continues when full production and distribution have been achieved.  Product requirements  In addition, package testing often relates to the specific product inside the package. Some broad categories of products and special package testing considerations follow:  Food packaging  Foods categories such as fresh produce, frozen foods, irradiated foods, fresh fish, canned foods, etc. have regulatory requirements and special packaging needs. Package testing often relates to: :::Food safety :::Compatibility of the package with the food :::Migration of material from the packaging to the food :::Shelf life :::Barrier properties, porosity, package atmosphere, etc :::Special quality assurance needs, good manufacturing practices, HACCP, validation protocols, etc  Pharmaceutical packaging  Packaging for drugs and pharmaceuticals is highly regulated. Special testing needs include: :::Safety of drugs and pharmaceuticals :::Barrier properties :::Shelf life :::Compatibility of package with the drugs :::Sterility :::Tamper resistance, child resistance, etc :::Special quality assurance needs, good manufacturing practices, validation protocols, etc  Medical Packaging  Packaging for medical materials, medical devices, health care supplies, etc., have special user requirements and is highly regulated. Barrier properties, durability, visibility, sterility and strength need to be controlled; usually with documented test results for initial designs and for production. Assurance of sterility and suitability for use are critical. For example, medical devices and products are often sterilized in the package. The sterility must be maintained throughout distribution to allow immediate use by physicians. A series of special packaging tests is used to measure the ability of the package to maintain sterility. Verification and validation protocols are rigidly maintained. ::Relevant standards :::ASTM F1585 – Guide for Integrity Testing of Porous Medical Packages :::ASTM D3078 – Standard Test Method for Detection of Leaks in Flexible Packaging (Bubble) :::ASTM F1140 – Standard Test Methods for Internal Pressurization Failure Resistance of Unrestrained Packages :::ASTM F1608 – Standard Test Method for Microbial Ranking of Packaging Materials :::ASTM F1929 – Standard Test Method for Detecting Seal Strength in Porous Medical Packaging by Dye Penetration :::ASTM F2054 – Standard Test Method for Burst Testing of Flexible Package Seals Using Internal Air Pressurization Within Restraining Plates :::ASTM F2095 – Standard Test Methods for Pressure Decay Leak Test for Flexible Packages With and Without Restraining Plates :::ASTM F2096 – Standard Test Method for Detecting Gross Leaks in Medical Packaging by Internal Pressurization :::ASTM F2097 – Standard Guide for Design and Evaluation of Primary Flexible Packaging for Medical Products :::ASTM F2228 – Standard Test Method for Non-Destructive Detection of Leaks in Medical Packaging Which Incorporates Pourous Barrier Material by CO2 Tracer Gas :::ASTM F2391 – Standard Test Method for Measuring Package and Seal Integrity using Helium as the Tracer Gas :::ASTM F3039 - Standard Test Method for Detecting Leaks in Nonporous Packaging or Flexible Barrier Materials by Dye Penetration :::EN 868-1 – Packaging materials and systems for medical devices which are to be sterilized.

It began in 1940 at the History Department at the University of Notre Dame as the Quarterly Bulletin of the Teachers' History Club. Nuns attending the graduate history program in the summer edited and mimeographed the bulletin. Each issue ran 20-50 pages, with informal teaching tips, evaluations of textbooks, and short thematic essays by Notre Dame professors. Its 110 subscribers were mostly teachers at Catholic high schools in the Midwest. In 1967 Notre Dame history Professor Leon Bernard transformed the bulletin into a national quarterly journal under the current title. He brought in a national advisory board of eminent scholars. It included only one professor based in a school of education and only one from a Catholic school. The circulation climbed to 3000. In 1972 Professor Eugene L. Asher brought it to coordinating faculty members at the Department of History at California State University, Long Beach, and built a large staff and attracted essays from prominent scholars. The emphasis shifted from high school to college teachers. Asher set up the Society for History Education as official publisher outside the university chain of command, and it was the vehicle for applying for major federal grants for conferences. The subscriber base reached 4000. Meanwhile, the American Historical Association waxed hot and cold, with many of its leaders hostile to the idea of promoting undergraduate teaching (as opposed to graduate level teaching). It gave no help. The journal has articles on history teaching primarily at the undergraduate level, as well as historiography covering a full range of historical topics. It reviews textbooks and monographs of value in undergraduate education. History teachers prepare and deliver lectures on topics such as ancient history, medieval history, postwar civilizations, and the history of third-world countries. They are responsible for evaluate and grade students' class work, assignments, and papers, prepare course materials and syllabi, facilitate and moderate classroom discussions, maintain student attendance records, plan, evaluate, and revise curricula, course content, and course materials and methods of instruction. A history teacher also conducts research, advises students on academic and vocational curricula, collaborates with colleagues to address teaching and research issues, participates in campus and community events, offers professional consulting services to government, educational institutions, and organizations.

The podcasts are noted as an arena for individuals critical of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, skeptic and dissident individuals. History In September 2005, after finding reasons to stay a member of the LDS Church despite a crisis of faith, John Dehlin created the Mormon Stories podcast as an open discussion of Mormon issues with the intention of giving listeners reasons to remain in the church. Through interviews, Mormon Stories focused on varying Mormon experiences and perspectives, including antagonistic, apologetic, intellectual, gay, black, fundamentalist, feminist, and dissenting. Several notable Mormon figures were guests on Mormon Stories, including Gregory Prince, Todd Compton, Grant H. Palmer, Darius Gray, Margaret Blair Young, Richard Bushman, and Margaret and Paul Toscano. Mormon Stories has been featured in many venues, including being broadcast on KVNU in Logan, Utah. In June 2007 John Dehlin was quoted for stories by The New York Times and Good Morning America, discussing Mitt Romney and Mormonism. At times personally conflicted about continuing Mormon Stories, Dehlin stopped and restarted the project a few times. In January 2010 Dehlin resumed the blog and podcast, focusing on faith crises, mental illnesses, and notable guests, beginning with interviews of Joanna Brooks and John C. Hamer. Among numerous other regular hosts who have joined Dehlin in conducting interviews for the podcast were Dan Wotherspoon, former editor of Sunstone magazine, and Natasha Helfer Parker, a licensed clinical marriage and family therapist. In 2015, Dehlin said Stories episodes had \\"tens of thousands\\" of listeners and that the webcast's \\"goal has always been to alleviate suffering. It's an act of love.\\" Dehlin was excommunicated for apostasy by the LDS Church in 2015. In 2016 the Open Stories foundation reported Dehlin's 2017 salary and bonus was $82,500 and $27,000 respectively. Mormon Stories content focuses on the criticism of LDS Doctrine and Practices and advertises for Dehlin's faith transition workshops and life coaching services. Criticism In 2013, a critical review of Mormon Stories by Gregory L. Smith was published in Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture. In the review, Smith alleges that \\"Dehlin is frequently uninformed of the often controversial material he discusses with interviewees, and that he promotes views hostile to the foundational beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\".Stephen Smoot, \\"Controversial Paper Critiquing Popular Mormon Podcast Published\\", Student Review, February 2013. The pending publication of the piece catalyzed within the Mormon studies community a discussion (referred to by some as the Dehlin affair) about the roles of apologetic and non-faith- based scholarship, respectively, within the academic study of Mormonism by Mormons. Guests Featured guests of the podcast include Latter-day Saints considered orthodox, \\"curious,\\" doubters and heretics. These have included: Guests have also included a number of \\"NeverMos\\" (short for \\"never-Mormons\\") and former Mormons who have either backgrounds in \\"comparative religions/cults\\" or histories of being associated with the Church of Latter- day Saints without ever becoming members.

It belongs to the Algonquins of Barriere Lake of the Algonquin Nation.Aboriginal Community profile: Barrière Lake First Nation , Indian and Northern Affairs Canada The reserve is an enclave within the Lac-Pythonga unorganized territory and in the middle of the La Vérendrye Wildlife Reserve. It is accessible by a short road from Quebec Route 117, approximately north of Grand-Remous. In recent years, the community has been troubled by poor living conditions, financial difficulties, governance disputes, school closure, and protests. History The Algonquin have long lived in the Outaouais, following a traditional nomadic life. Evidence has been found of Algonquin presence at Lake Barrière on the Ottawa River from the 18th century. Not until 1851 did the Hudson's Bay Company establish a trading post first at the former Lake Cabonga (named Kakabonga at that time). When this post burned down in 1873, it was replaced by a new post on Lake Barrière in 1874, that was identified as Mitakanabikong or Mitchikanabikong, and as Barrière from 1876 on. On September 7, 1961, the Rapid Lake Reserve was formed when the Government of Quebec transferred control and administration of in the geographic township of Émard to the Government of Canada. It took its name from the former Rapide Lake, which was submerged below the waters of Cabonga Reservoir, created in 1929. Despite these lands being reserved for use by the Algonquins, they continued to regularly visit the site at Barrière Lake about north because of their historic ties to it. Even today, many families continue to go to Barrière Lake to practice traditional activities.Natural Resources Canada - Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review - Rapid Lake In 1995, because of a leadership dispute, some families left the reserve and settled on Jean-Peré Lake, not far to the south, also in La Vérendrye Park. Another result was that the traditional oral rules for leadership selection were codified in writing for the first time in 1996. However, leadership disputes arose again in 2006 when two separate band councils were selected by separate Elder Councils, embroiling the community in legal proceedings and governance disputes until today. On October 6, 2008, seventy-five members of the Barrière Lake Algonquins set up a roadblock on Highway 117, demanding that the federal and provincial governments honour a resource-sharing agreement signed twenty years earlier. This protest was repeated a month later on November 19. Both protests disrupted traffic for hours by dragging logs onto the road, and ending with police confrontation. Education There is one school on the reserve, Rapid Lake School, with classes for pre-kindergarten to Secondary grade 3. Since 1995, the school is under the jurisdiction of the Band Council, that can tailor the school's curriculum to local cultural realities in accordance with provincial standards. In addition to recognized provincial programs, the school also teaches the Algonquin language.

It is published quarterly by the AATSP and covers Spanish and Portuguese literature, linguistics, and pedagogy. Hispania publishes in literature, linguistics, and pedagogy having to do with Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking communities, as well as book/media reviews, which are subdivided into Pan-Hispanic/Luso- Brazilian Literary and Cultural Studies, linguistics, language, media, and fiction and film. History The first publication of Hispania dates to the earliest days of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese and the first issue featured a summation of the possibilities of the new organization, written by Lawrence Wilkins, as well as an outline of future plans for the journal written by its founding editor in chief, Aurelio M. Espinosa (Stanford University).Walsh, Donald Devenish. Hispania, Vol. 50, No. 4, Fiftieth Anniversary Number (Dec. 1967) p. 823-833 In the outline, Espinosa defined the journal's chief aim as \\"the betterment of the teaching of Spanish in our schools and colleges\\".Espinosa, Aurelio. Hispania, Vol. 1, Organization Number (Nov., 1917) p. 19-23 Accordingly, Hispania's original subtitle was \\"A Journal Devoted to the Interests of Teachers of Spanish,\\" which reflected the earnest pedagogic tone and content of its first volumes. In keeping with his vision of the journal's purpose, Espinosa published more pedagogical material than any of his successors: fully 64 percent of the articles in the nine volumes he edited were pedagogical in nature. Alfred Coester succeeded Espinosa as editor, a position he held for the next 14 years. During his tenure the journal grew significantly in scope and readership, adding new sections, such as the \\"Professional Literature\\" section devoted to reviewing pedagogical articles and books. In 1941, a report of the Committee on General Policies led to a revision of Hispania's scope by recommending among others that its \\"contents should strike a balance between material of interest to secondary teachers and articles primarily of interest to university members\\". Further revisions called for more articles on Spanish in elementary schools, on relations with Hispanic America, and on attitudes of personal educators toward the teaching of Spanish and Portuguese. Henry Grattan Doyle succeeded Coester in 1942. Doyle had been editor of the Modern Language Journal for four years before he became editor of Hispania. Doyle instituted the anonymous peer review process that is still in place today. He also increased the number of articles dealing with Luso-Brazilian languages and literatures. Other additions Doyle made to the editorial process included assigning books for review and ceasing to accept unsolicited reviews. The post World War II era was ushered in with a new editor, Donald Walsh, in 1949. Walsh is considered by many, including his successor, Robert Mead Jr., to have developed Hispania into the modern language journal it is today.Mead, Robert G., Jr. Hispania, Vol. 75, No. 4, “The Quincentennial of the Columbian Era.” (Oct., 1992) p. 1083-1086. Walsh broke with the previous editors' focus on pedagogy by broadening Hispania's scope, diversifying its contents, adding new sections, soliciting contributions from colleagues known for their expertise, and making sure that every issue of the journal had something of practical use and pedagogical value to both the K-12 teacher and the graduate-level professor. Walsh also instituted the change to a two-column format, which saved the journal space and money. He retired from the editorship in 1957. Robert Meade, Jr. (University of Connecticut) became interim editor in 1958, having already served since 1953 as an associate editor. Meade reiterated the message that articles must be broad enough in scope to interest the more than 5,000 members, nearly half of whom taught in secondary schools. Meade served during a time of rapid growth within the profession due to increased interest in foreign language study as well as increased funding through the National Defense Education Act (instituted to keep pace with the former USSR in mathematics, science, and foreign languages). Meade's editorial leadership increased the number of literary articles published in order to rectify an imbalance between the various sections. Seymour Menton (University of Kansas) succeeded Meade in 1963. During his three-year tenure as editor, Menton also strove to rectify an imbalance in the journal's article ratio by calling for more literary contributions from members. He created a second book review section that focused on reviewing books of scholarly and literary interest, as opposed to the original one, which focused on textbook reviews. Irving P. Rothberg, who had edited the book review section for nearly nine years prior, succeeded Menton in 1966 and served until 1974. He was in turn succeeded by Donald W. Bleznick, who instituted the inclusion of an editorial policy in each number of Hispania outlining what the journal would and would not accept for publication, a move intended to reduce the number of unwanted submissions.Bleznick, Donald W. Hispania, Vol. 75, No. 4, “The Quincentennial of the Columbian Era.” (Oct., 1992) p. 1083-1086. Bleznick managed the journal during one of its most trying times, after a fire destroyed its printing facility in Appleton, Wisconsin in May 1979. He oversaw the reconstruction of the journal and found it a new publisher in time to have it in print again by 1980. Theodore A. Sackett became editor in 1984 and directed the journal through most the 1980s. Sackett added \\"Pedagogy\\" as a special section in Hispania in order to address the changing face of the classroom that resulted from the advent of computers and the new concern for communicative competence.Oxford, Raquel. Hispania, Vol. 82, No. 2 (May, 1999), p.293-297. He was succeeded by Estelle Irizarry in 1993. During her editorship, Hispania became the first journal in the humanities to digitalize and produce a CD of articles dating from its inception in 1917 through 1990, a project for which members volunteered to prepare issues or volumes. Irizarry also improved efficiency and reduced decision time. Under her tenure, the journal was awarded second place for the \\"Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement\\" from the Council of Editors of Learned Journals in 1995. Janet Pérez assumed the editorship in 2000. Her final term ended in 2009. The end of her editorship coincided with her induction as a permanent member of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language at a ceremony at the Instituto Cervantes in New York City. Sheri Spaine Long, the former editor of Foreign Language Annals, succeeded Pérez as Editor in January 2010. Concurrently, Johns Hopkins University Press became the publisher of the journal. Long’s editorship ended in 2018. Benjamin Fraser began as Editor of the journal in 2018.

Background  Bred in Kentucky by Overbrook Farm, Winslow Homer is a gray horse with three white socks and a white blaze. He was sired by Unbridled's Song, the sire of many notable horses such as Arrogate, Will Take Charge, and Forever Unbridled. His dam, Summer Raven, won the Tempted Stakes as a juvenile and placed in two other stakes. Winslow Homer is a half-brother to multiple Gr.II winner Lewis Bay and full brother to General George Handicap winner Misconnect. Rick Porter, under his banner Fox Hill Farm, purchased Winslow Homer for $310,000 at the 2008 Keeneland September Yearling Sale. He was the highest-priced yearling of his class by his stallion. Named for the artist, Winslow Homer was trained by Anthony W. Dutrow.  Racing career  Winslow Homer made his racing debut on July 28, 2009 in a maiden race at Delaware Park, finishing third by a neck. He broke his maiden next out in a maiden race at Saratoga, and won again at Philadelphia Park in an allowance by a 12 ½ length margin. Winslow Homer made his first start as a sophomore in the Holy Bull Stakes, a race that was both his stakes and graded stakes debut. Breaking from the 6 starting gate at odds of 7-2, Winslow Homer won the race by a length over Jackson Bend. His final time was 1:35.97. After his win, Winslow Homer was considered an early favorite for the Kentucky Derby, but was sidelined with a stress fracture and did not make the race. He didn't race again until June, when he finished third in the Iowa Derby behind Concord Point and Thiskyhasnolimit. The colt next won the listed Curlin Stakes at Saratoga by 9 lengths in what was the final win of his career. After the Curlin Stakes, Winslow Homer was sidelined again with a colyndar fracture in his left foreleg. Winslow Homer returned the next year in March, contesting the 2011 Razorback Handicap as the 9-5 favorite. Winslow Homer trailed towards the end of the field for most of the race, before moving up to fourth at the top of the stretch. Winslow Homer did not hold long and he faded back into 6th place. He fared much better next-out in the Oaklawn Handicap, finishing third. He did not race again until October, finishing second and fifth in two allowance races. He did not race Winslow Homer was again sidelined and did not race in 2012. He made his final start in September 2013 in the listed Super Stakes at Tampa Bay Downs, finishing fourth. He was retired afterwards with a race record of 11: 4-1-3 and earnings of $273,365.  Retirement and Stud Career  Winslow Homer was retired to Brent and Crystal Fernung's Journeyman Stud in Ocala, Florida. His stud fee for his first year as a stallion was $5,000. Winslow Homer's first winner came on July 1, 2017 when filly Cloe Raven won a maiden race at Louisiana Downs. Cloe Raven was the favorite for the race, and won by over 6 lengths in gate-to-wire fashion.

Concept and construction Dome was founded in 1975 by brothers Minoru and Shoichi Hayashi, who had built their first racing car ten years earlier. In 1980 the company built its first Formula Three car, and the Hayashi Racing team won the All-Japan Formula Three Championship in 1981 using its own 320 chassis. Dome first entered the Japanese Formula 3000 series in 1987, using a March chassis, but had plans to build its own chassis. Hayashi established a separate company, Jiotto Design, as a design department for Dome. As a result of this progress, Marco Apicella won the 1994 championship driving the Dome F104 chassis equipped with a Mugen Honda engine. Jiotto's facilities included a 25 per cent wind tunnel, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing equipment, and several autoclaves: all of which could be used to design and construct a more complicated Formula One car., p. 17. In 1995, the former team manager of the Minardi Formula One team, Tadashi Sasaki, joined Dome. Sasaki organised a Formula One project which was announced in the autumn of that year. Akiyoshi Oku, who had designed the F104 F3000 car, began work on the new F105 chassis in the summer of 1995. Sasaki's influence was crucial, as he was in a position to buy Minardi's old gearbox and hydraulic systems to use on the F105. The transmission was a six-speed semi-automatic gearbox designed by Xtrac, and had previously been used, in addition to the Minardi team, by the unraced DAMS GD-01 car and formerly in the Simtek S941 chassis during the season. In terms of the car's engine, Dome's success with Mugen Honda engines in the Japanese racing scene ensured that the F105 would be powered by the company's MF301 V10 engine, as used by the Ligier team during the 1995 Formula One season. Dome's close association with Mugen, a subsidiary of Honda, sparked rumours that the Japanese company was using the Dome F105 project as a discreet evaluation of a return to Formula One after its own withdrawal from the sport at the end of the season., p. 18. Dome has denied that this was the case, insisting that it was an independent effort., p. 19. The F105 was, like any Formula One car of its time, constructed around a carbon-fibre monocoque. It featured a conventional double wishbone suspension arrangement with pushrod-actuated dampers provided by Showa. Dome reached an agreement with Goodyear for tyres, although this was almost scuppered when the American company suspected that the F105 project was a ruse constructed by Japanese rival Bridgestone, which had announced its own intention to enter Formula One in , to acquire information about its tyres. The F105 ran on magnesium wheels made by Rays, with dimensions of by at the front, and by at the rear. It also featured one- piece bodywork covering the sidepods and engine cover., p. 25. The F105 was liveried in traditional Japanese white with a fluorescent yellow stripe around the cockpit and engine cover, and had minimal sponsorship. The car was completed on March 17, 1996. Testing The F105 was launched at the Spiral building in Tokyo on March 18, 1996. Marco Apicella, who had won the 1994 Japanese Formula 3000 championship with Dome, and local drivers Naoki Hattori and Shinji Nakano were selected as the project's test drivers. Apicella and Hattori both had brief experience of competing in F1, whilst Nakano was a Honda protégé who was driving for Dome in F3000. The F105 was tested for the first time at the Japanese Mine circuit in the spring of 1996, driven by Nakano, before the programme moved to Suzuka in the hand of Apicella. By April, the F105 had completed and its engine was replaced with a new one. The car reached the mark in May, by which time a baseline setup had been established. Apicella reported that it tended to oversteer at the entry to corners, understeer on exit, the aerodynamic balance was unstable, and that the car's brakes were spongy. A more serious problem occurred during one of the testing sessions at Suzuka when an oil leak stranded the car out on the circuit and caused a major fire which extensively damaged the F105 chassis., p. 21. Dome planned to establish a European test base during the summer of 1996 and run at several European circuits on the calendar of the 1996 Formula One season, but this plan never came to fruition due to a shortage of funding. The team did, however, test at Suzuka shortly after the season-ending 1996 Japanese Grand Prix at the circuit. Hattori set a best time of 1:46.270, which was more than seven seconds slower than Jacques Villeneuve's pole position time of 1:38.909 set in the Williams FW18 chassis. It was also 0.3 seconds slower than the 107% cut-off mark for qualification, although journalist Sam Collins speculates that a faster time could have been set with a top-line driver. Dome's lack of sponsorship eventually forced it to cancel its plans to enter the 1997 Formula One season in the autumn of 1996. Nakano left the project and was promoted to Formula One with the Prost (formerly Ligier) team, which was equipped with Mugen engines. Sasaki attempted to obtain funding to compete in the 1998 season and beyond from a variety of sources, including the Nigerian Prince Malik Ado Ibrahim, who eventually invested in the Arrows team instead after negotiations with Honda for a fresh supply of engines fell through., p. 27. The 1998 season also saw changes to the sport's technical regulations which rendered the F105 obsolete. In 1999, Sasaki entered negotiations with a Dutch company and plans were made to put the ageing F105 through another testing programme before building a revised F106 chassis, but the company insisted that the chassis be equipped with a Honda engine. At this point, Honda was in the process of evaluating a full-scale return to the sport with the test Honda RA099 chassis, and ultimately through the supply of works engines to the British American Racing team for the 2000 season, and was unwilling to supply a new customer team in addition to these commitments., pp. 28-29. As a result, Dome definitively abandoned its Formula One ambitions and has concentrated on the Japanese racing scene and sports car racing in the 21st century. The sole F105 chassis, still fitted with its Mugen engine, is currently stored underneath the wind tunnel at Dome's headquarters in Maibara., p. 31.

Early life Art Davis was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi where he attended Clarksdale High School. He received a football scholarship to Mississippi State after missing his entire senior high school football season breaking his leg in the first game. He was voted \\"Best Athlete\\" and \\"Mr. CHS\\" at Clarksdale High School. Davis's nickname growing up was \\"Honeybee\\" which was given to him by a nurse when he was a young boy. College career At Mississippi State, Davis began his college football career as a four-year starter for Coach Murray Warmath as a true freshman defensive back in the 1952 season opener against defending National Champion, University of Tennessee. In the 1953 season-opener against Memphis State, Davis was a two-way starter and scored the first touchdown of Jack Cristil's 58-year broadcasting career for the Bulldogs. On Thanksgiving Day, Davis caught a touchdown pass from Jackie Parker to tie Ole Miss 7–7, knocking the Rebels out of Cotton Bowl contention and the Southeastern Conference crown. In 1954, Davis was voted the Southeastern Conference \\"Player of the Year\\" (Nashville Banner, Atlanta Constitution) where he scored 10 touchdowns and grabbed 4 interceptions playing both ways. He was also named the SEC's \\"Best Offensive Back\\" in 1954 (Atlanta Constitution). In that '54 campaign, Davis scored four touchdowns against LSU (3 rushing, 1 interception return) in a 25–0 win at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge. During that season, Davis played all 60 minutes in 6 of 10 games. In 1955 as team co-captain, Davis was named first team All America by FWAA/Look (American magazine) and College Football's \\"Player of the Year\\" by the Football Writers Association of America. He was named as the \\"Best Defensive Back\\" and runner-up as \\"Best Offensive Back\\" in the SEC (Atlanta Constitution) that same year. He also punted for over a 40 yard average. Playing with a separated shoulder and injured knee at Auburn, Davis ran for a short touchdown, passed for a 35-yard score, had a 54-yard punt and made 11 unassisted tackles in a 27–26 loss. He finished his college career with 18 TDs. Davis was a sprinter on the track team and was nosed out in the finals of the 1955 SEC Track and Field Championship's 100 yard dash in a photo-finish. His best time in the 100 yard dash was 9.8 seconds. During the Auburn loss in 1955, Davis seriously injured his knee and would have to miss the North Texas State and Alabama games. The week of the Alabama game, thousands of leaflets were dropped from an airplane onto the Mississippi State campus. The message was \\"Beat Bama Win for Arthur\\" to encourage the students and football team as they traveled to Tuscaloosa for Bama's Homecoming. The Bulldogs prevailed 26-7. Bart Starr was the Crimson Tide quarterback, and he and Davis would be teammates in the Blue-Gray Game later that year. As told by longtime Miss. State football announcer, Jack Cristil, in MSU's Alumnus Magazine in 1969 and again in Sid Salter's book, \\"Jack Cristil: Voice of the Bulldogs\\" published in 2011: \\"Arthur Davis to me personifies Mississippi State students and athletes. I knew him when he was a youngster in high school in Clarksdale. Watched him grow up and remember the first play of his senior year as a high school performer. He caught a pass in the flat and broke his leg. This would have broken the spirit of many young men, but not Arthur Davis. He came to Mississippi State as a tremendous performer, earned All American honors as he should have, played in his senior year badly crippled and injured but certainly gave it - as the coaches always say - that 110 percent effort on and off the field. He has been a true gentleman throughout his life ... I've always thought of Arthur Davis as being what I would like to think of as typically Mississippi State in every way.\\" Davis was voted \\"Mr. Mississippi State\\" by the students and was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. After his senior season, Davis and was selected to play in the 1955 Blue-Gray Game (Gray team captain, 2 interceptions), the 1956 Senior Bowl, and the 1956 College All-Star Game vs. the Cleveland Browns. He is a member of the Mississippi State Athletic Hall of Fame (1971) and the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame (1981). In 2004, Davis was named to the SEC Football Legends at the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta, Georgia. He is a \\"Mississippi Football Legend\\" by the Jackson Touchdown Club. In 2018, Davis and Walt Harris were enshrined into Mississippi State football's \\"Ring of Honor\\" adding their names to the facade of Davis Wade Stadium. They joined former Bulldog greats Jack Cristil, Jackie Parker, Shorty McWilliams, D.D. Lewis, Kent Hull, Johnie Cooks, and Joe Fortunato. Art's older brother, Harper Davis, was an all-SEC, four-year starter at Mississippi State. Harper is also a member of the Mississippi State Athletic Hall of Fame, the State of Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, and is a 2002 SEC Football Legends inductee. He played professionally for the Los Angeles Dons, Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers and was later the Head Football Coach at Millsaps College (1964–1988) in Jackson, Mississippi. Professional career In the 1956 NFL Draft., Davis was selected in the first round, fifth overall, by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was limited during his rookie season in by an injured shoulder which he suffered in the College All-Star Game vs. the Cleveland Browns as well as a knee injury he sustained in college and again with the Steelers. The knee injury would also sideline him for the season. He announced his retirement from football prior to the season. Coaching career After professional football, Davis started his coaching career at Biloxi High School in 1957. He then became an assistant coach at LSU under Coach Paul Dietzel in 1959 and 1960, and was the freshman coach at Georgia Tech under Coach Bobby Dodd in 1961 and 1962. Davis was hired as the defensive backfield coach at the University of Texas in 1963, and in that season under Coach Darrell Royal, the Longhorns won the National Championship and then beat Navy, 28–6, in the 1964 Cotton Bowl. He retired from college coaching after that season to pursue business opportunities in Mississippi and spend more time with his family. Later in life, Davis coached at Lee Academy in Clarksdale, Mississippi and Central Catholic High School in Portland, Oregon. Personal Davis was married to the former Frances Habig of Jackson, Mississippi for 58 years until her death in 2014. They have two children, four grandchildren, and four great grandchildren. Art's son, Doug, played tennis at Mississippi State in the early 1980s and grandson, Brad Jones, played first base and was team captain for the Bulldog baseball team in the early 2000s. The Davises are relatives of the Ganong Bros. candy-making family based in St. Stephen New Brunswick, Canada.

The hill was formerly involved in local liturgical practice. 19th century sources record that three crosses standing on its top, but by the 20th century these had been removed. During the mid 19th century, there used to be processions, with pilgrims walking three times around the hill before ascending it to \\"listen to the noise\\" and leave small sacrifices in a pit at the top. People suffering from headache used to put sand from the pit in their ears. These practices are described by A. A. Panchenko in 1998.Панченко А.А., Исследования в области народного православия. Деревенские святыни Северо-Запада России (Studies on the national orthodoxy. Village shrines in Northwestern Russia), pp. 142-144. The site and the associated folk customs were first described by M. Bystrov in 1879. Bystrov records the tradition that the sand from the hill had miraculous power on Trinity Sunday, and that if the hill was ascended on that day, the sound of bells could be heard if one \\"listened in a special way\\", and that on this day, pilgrims from as far as 50 miles away would come to the hill in hope of curing headaches.Быстров М., Остатки старины близ Передольского погоста, Лужского уезда, С.-Петербургской губернии // Известия Русского археологического общества. 1879.

The kurgan has not been excavated, but in 2002 a georadar survey was performed by the Russian Federal Geological Institute (ВСЕГЕИ), and in 2003 to 2004, the Institute for the History of Material Culture of the Russian Academy of Sciences has done experimental surveys testing non-intrusive archaeological methods. The kurgan is 14.6 m in height and 70 m in diameter, comparable in proportion to the largest Migration era tumuli in Scandinavia such as Raknehaugen. Aleksashin (2006) discusses a boulder with a monogrammatic inscription he found on the hill in 2003.

Bruner was also a pioneer in support of the Canadian music industry Cancon momentum. In her later years, Bruner acquired the Book Cellar (Yorkville) which was considered by many to be the best independent book store in Canada. Early life and family Lorraine \\"Lori\\" Lenore Bruner was born on January 24, 1932, in Toronto, Ontario, the second daughter of Marie Clarinda (Clara) White née Allary and Clifford James White. Bruner spent her childhood growing up in Toronto, Ontario with her siblings, Percy, Cynthia, and Patricia. In 1943, at the age of 11, Bruner was sent to live in foster care until she was 16 and then lived with Arthur and Katie Roseborough in Scarborough, Ontario. Bruner eventually moved to Dartmouth, Nova Scotia with the Roseborough's. While living in Nova Scotia, Bruner earned a job at a local retail record store, where she met Rodeo Records creator George Taylor. George encouraged Bruner to consider a career in Canada’s fast growing record industry. On July 15, 1955, Bruner was married to Canadian Naval Airman, Peter Charles Bruner at the chapel on the Shearwater Naval Base in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. They separated in 1958, finally divorcing on September 29, 1961. They had no children together. Music After her separation, Bruner moved back to Toronto in late 1958. She followed up on Taylor’s counsel and began working at the Promenade Music Centre in the prestigious Bay-Bloor district. In the late-1950s Bruner moved over to run the Promenade Music Center store at Yonge-St. Clair and by 1958 she was managing the Disc Shop in Scarborough’s Golden Mile Plaza. In 1959, Bruner moved to an inside sales position for London Records of Canada distributor MacKay Records. In 1960, Bruner joined Astral Records and became second in command. While there, Bruner was responsible for a number of British hits in North America by artists like Lonnie Donegan, Kenny Ball, and Petula Clark. In 1964 Bruner signed on with RPM Magazine where she collaborated with RPM’s Publisher, Walt Grealis on a weekly industry insider column. While there, Bruner also worked with Grealis and RPM’s co-founder, Stan Klees to spearhead the \\"Cancon Momentum\\" which led to the legislation of Canadian record play on AM radio in 1971. Together, the trio also established the RPM Gold Leaf Awards which became the Juno Awards in 1971. Today, the Juno’s are one of the highest rated Canadian variety programs on television.\\"Juno awards: TV ratings, hosts and host cities\\" - Canwest News Service, March 24, 2009 In 1967, while working at RPM Magazine, Bruner was approached by Polydor Ltd. to work as Senior Manager Regional Promotion. During her tenure at Ploydor, Bruner was regarded as a promotional genius and was credited with contributing to a large share of Polydor’s outstanding growth in Canada.\\"Leon Thomas, accompanied by Flying Dutchman boss Bob Thiele and Polydor promotion genius Lori Bruner ...\\" CODA: the journal of jazz & improvised music - v. 10 -1971 - p. 38 . During her tenure, Bruner promoted many successful bands like the Bee Gees, Thin Lizzy, Cream, B.B. King, Leon Thomas, James Last, Rush, Frank Mills, and Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Bruner’s success and accomplishments at Polydor trail blazed the way for other women who wanted to break into the male-dominated Canadian record companies.\\"Polydor Ups Lori Bruner\\" - Billboard, December 21, 1968. She is still considered a hero to many of the women who work in the industry today. Books In 1983, Bruner purchased the Book Cellar in Toronto’s prestigious Yorkville area from Bruce and Vivienne Surtees. The Book Cellar was considered by many to be one of the best independent book stores in Canada.\\"Robert Fulford's column about the Book Cellar\\" - Globe and Mail, January 14, 1998. With its sophisticated collection of fictional and classic books and magazines, and perpetually high quality jazz and classical music in the background, the store provided an intellectual yet relaxed atmosphere. It was hard to pass by the Book Cellar without dropping in. Situated across from the renowned Four Seasons Yorkville Hotel, the Book Cellar was the book store to the stars.\\"Robert Fulford's column about the Book Cellar\\" - Globe and Mail, January 14, 1998. Bruner often received prominent clientele including Elizabeth Taylor, Shirley MacLaine, Madonna, Mick Jagger, Whoopi Goldberg, and Keith Richards, who frequented her store when in Toronto. Local journalists and writers, like Philip Marchand, Robert Fulford, and Judy Stoffman would also stop in often. Bruner also hosted many world-famous authors like Robertson Davies, Marshall McLuhan, Michael Ondaatje, Sir Peter Ustinov, Shirley Temple Black, Tom Wolfe, Jeffrey Archer, Dominick Dunne, Nancy Sinatra, Martin Amis, and Joy Fielding, who made it a point to include the Book Cellar store on their itinerary, sometimes to autograph their books and sometimes just to check out other author’s works. Nevertheless, Bruner insisted that all of her customers were to be looked after with the same cerebral service by her charming and well-educated staff. Bruner’s employees were also notable. Two well-known Canadian authors, playwright John Krizanc and novelist and the late screenwriter Paul Quarrington, worked several years at The Book Cellar, while Toronto Star journalist and CBC broadcaster Joey Slinger lent a helping hand from time to time.\\"The laughs were on him at Quarrington's life fete\\" - Toronto Star, Author: Vit Wagner, October 26, 2009; Page E.3. In 1987, Bruner worked together with several other Toronto area retail bookstore owners in lobbying the Ontario government to allow retail bookstores be allowed to open Sundays.\\"Sunday sales of books likely to get government okay\\" - Toronto Star - Author: William Walker, June 9, 1987; Page: A.21. After much pressure from retailers and consumers alike, the Rae government finally passed the legislation in June 1992, to permit Sunday shopping in Ontario. Bruner closed the Book Cellar down in November 1997. Like hundreds of other Canadian owned independent bookstores, the Book Cellar succumbed to the pressure of the publishers imposing ever-stricter credit limits while facing serious price competition and lost traffic to the superstore and fledgling internet book retailers.\\"Independent booksellers weigh effect of collapses - Toronto Star - Author: Judy Stoffman, January 8, 1997; Page B.3. Antiques and later life Bruner took little time off after closing the Book Cellar before she quickly found herself another outlet in retailing, dealing in Antiques. It was a natural fit, considering Bruner’s zeal for dealing with the public, combined with her knowledge and experience with antique furnishings and artwork. Bruner had been purchasing antiques for her personal collection since 1971. For nearly a decade since, Bruner has worked in several prestigious antique shops and art galleries throughout Toronto.

She underwent conversion to a research vessel in 1952. Construction The unnamed single- screw ocean-going tug ATA-179 (originally projected as the rescue tug, ATR-106) was laid down on 22 May 1944 at Orange, Texas, by the Levingston Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 30 June 1944; and commissioned on 22 September 1944, Lt. (jg.) Thomas C. McLaren, USNR, in command. World War II operations After fitting out, ATA-179 conducted shakedown training out of Galveston, Texas, before undergoing post-shakedown availability at that port until 24 October. Two days later, the tug departed Galveston for Tampa, Florida, with a covered lighter, YF-6H, in tow, and reached her destination on the 28th. Taking the barracks ship APL-19 in tow, the tug sailed for the Panama Canal Zone on 4 November 1944, reaching her destination with her two tows on the 13th. Transiting the Panama Canal three days later, she sailed for Bora Bora, in the Society Islands, on 30 November 1944, and reached her destination on 22 December. On the day after Christmas, ATA-179 got underway for Finschhafen, New Guinea, towing YF-6H. She then towed the lighter to Hollandia, New Guinea, arriving on 12 January 1945, before proceeding on to Leyte with APL-19 and YF-6U in tow, arriving there on 5 February 1945. Assigned to Service Squadron Three, Service Force, Seventh Fleet, ATA-179 cleared Leyte on 18 February 1945 for the Carolines and reached Ulithi the following day. There, she took two floating workshops, YRD(H)-6 and YRD(M)-6, in tow and departed Ulithi on 24 February for the Philippines. Proceeding via Kossol Roads, in the Palaus, ATA-179 arrived at Leyte on 12 March 1945 and delivered her tows. Departing San Pedro Bay on 24 March, the tug reached Cebu on the 26th and picked up LCT-1296. towing her to Leyte. Proceeding thence to Hollandia, New Guinea, having left the tank craft at Leyte, ATA-179 picked up the tow of a dredge and four pontoon barges on 18 April and delivered them to Leyte on 1 May 1945. Returning to Hollandia, the tug then picked up four ammunition barges and towed them to Leyte as well, reaching the Philippines on 7 June. ATA-179 proceeded thence to Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, reaching that port on 26 June 1945. On 7 July, the tug cleared the New Hebrides with Section B of the advanced base sectional dock, ABSD-1, and the open lighter, YC-324, and headed for the Philippines. Proceeding via Hollandia, the tug and her two charges reached their destination on 2 August 1945. Departing Leyte on 7 August, ATA-179 sailed for the Padaido Islands, and there took David B. Henderson in tow on 12 August. She proceeded thence to Biak, New Guinea, and arrived on the following day. During the week that followed, ATA-179 towed a 400-ton pontoon drydock to Morotai and the covered lighter, YF-621, to Leyte. Proceeding thence to Morotai, the tug towed a 400-ton floating drydock and the motor minesweeper YMS-47 to Samar, and a 100-ton pontoon drydock from there to Subic Bay. For the balance of October 1945, the tug operated in the Philippine Islands, between Samar and Leyte. She towed seven pontoon barges from Samar to Subic Bay (24 to 28 October) and spent the remainder of 1945 and the first few months of the following year, 1946, based at Leyte. ATA-179 departed Leyte on 30 March 1946. She reached Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, on 6 April and departed there eight days later with a section of ABSD-4 in tow. Touching briefly at Eniwetok and Johnston Island en route, the tug reached Pearl Harbor on 24 May and proceeded thence to the west coast of the United States soon thereafter, towing AFD-2 to San Pedro. She then took LCS-66 to San Diego and arrived there on 12 September. Moving to San Pedro the same day, ATA-179 took APL-43 in tow and sailed for the Canal Zone on 12 October. She reached her destination on the 18th, and departed 11 days later, bound for Jacksonville, Florida with APL-43 and APL-34 in her wake, to deliver her tows to the Florida group of the reserve fleet. With new orders to deliver the barracks ships elsewhere, however, for preservation work, ATA-179 proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, which she reached on 8 November 1946. Over the next several months, ATA-179 participated in the demobilization process of many fleet units assigned temporarily to the Commandant, 8th Naval District, and performed tug and tow operations on the Gulf and Florida coasts, ranging from Key West and Mayport to New Orleans, Mobile, and Galveston until she herself was inactivated and placed out of commission, in reserve at Orange, Texas, on 10 October 1947. On 16 July 1948, she was named Allegheny (ATA-179). Hydrographic survey operations Allegheny was recommissioned on 25 July 1949 and departed for the Norfolk Naval Shipyard arriving on 8 August and remaining until 26 September when she sailed for New York. The ship departed New York on 1 October 1949 for the Mediterranean in company with and the survey ship which composed Hydrographic Survey Group One of the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office. The group reached Gibraltar on 13 October. Transiting the Mediterranean the survey group put in at Naples, Italy on 19 October. The ships sailed for Port Said, Egypt with a one day stop on 21 October at Argostolion, Greece. The ships reached the northern terminus of the Suez Canal on 24 October transiting on the 25th to reach Aden on 30 October 1949. Allegheny commenced her hydrographic work in that region soon thereafter. Over the next several weeks, she supported Maury as that ship operated in the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and the Persian Gulf conducting surveys of the uncharted waters of the Arabian coast. She touched at ports in Saudi Arabia; Kuwait; Bahrain; and Pakistan. The survey ships transited the Suez Canal on 4 May. Allegheny rounded out the deployment with visits to Algiers and Gibraltar before she sailed for the United States, reaching Norfolk on 27 May 1950. She moved to New York soon thereafter, and underwent post-deployment availability at the New York Naval Shipyard from 3 June to 8 September. Allegheny conducted survey operations at Newport, RI, following her overhaul at New York from 9 to 29 September 1950. She then returned to the naval shipyard following that work, to prepare for another deployment to the Persian Gulf, and sailed for the Mediterranean on 6 October. Reaching Gibraltar on 19 October, Allegheny visited Golfe Juan from 22 to 25 October and touched briefly at Port Said from 30 to 31 October before transiting the Suez Canal and proceeding down the Red Sea. Reaching Bahrain on 11 November, she remained there until the 13th when she got underway for Ras Tanura, making port there later the same day. She spent the remainder of the year 1950 and the first three and one-half months of 1951 operating from that Saudi oil port, ultimately sailing for Suez on 18 April 1951. She wound up the deployment with calls at Port Said, Naples, Algiers, and Gibraltar before she got underway to return to the United States on 18 May 1951. Allegheny arrived at the New York Naval Shipyard on the last day of May 1951 remaining there through the summer and into September. The ship departed New York on 17 September for Hampton Roads reaching Norfolk the next day. On 10 October she sailed for her third deployment to the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern waters visiting Athens from 30 October to 2 November before brief surveys in the Mediterranean before transiting the Suez Canal on 5 November. A port call at Aden on 10 November preceded her arrival at Bahrain on 17 November 1951. As in the previous deployment, she conducted survey work in the Bahrain-Ras Tanura area into the spring of 1952, winding up her work at the latter port on 12 April. Transiting the Suez Canal on 24 and 25 April 1952, Allegheny visited Naples and Monaco en route home, ultimately reaching Norfolk on 29 May 1952. Acoustic research operations Allegheny transited from Norfolk to the New York Naval Shipyard arriving on 14 June 1952 for conversion into a research vessel. During the summer of 1952 all armament and towing accessories were removed with the towing winch rotated 90° and modified for over the side operations. Various hydrographic and bathythermograph winches and booms were installed as was sonar and various electronic equipment. Shipboard spaces were converted to a machine shop, motor generator, and photographic laboratory. A new deckhouse was constructed aft to house underwater sound and electronic equipment. Allegheny was assigned to the Commandant, 3rd Naval District, for duty and based at the Naval Supply Center, Bayonne, NJ, The ship spent the next 17 years engaged in hydrographic and research functions through the Office of Naval Research (ONR). The ship supported acoustic research efforts of the Hudson Laboratories of Columbia University, Bell Telephone Company and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. In general the ship spent January through April in the Bermuda-Caribbean area with the rest of the year in the Long Island-Hudson Canyon region, off New York, and occasionally operations off Cape Hatteras. Ports of call included St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Willemstad, Curaçao; Miami and Port Everglades, Florida.; and Bermuda. In particular the ship supported Project Michael which was the Columbia University effort under Maurice Ewing to understand long range sound transmission in the SOFAR channel for the research and development of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). Project Michael was the research oriented part of the effort with a more development oriented Project Jezebel under Bureau of Ships and Bell Laboratories. Merger of results were implemented as the then classified name Sound Surveillance System under the unclassified name Project Caesar.There is close correlation of the dates and organizations with the early phase of developing the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) and associated acoustic research and development. An example of the ship's work is Hudson Laboratory's acoustic work in 1953. It was focused on low frequency sound propagation with Allegheny performing both bathymetric and acoustic work supporting those investigations. For example, the ship surveyed in Puerto Rico supporting an important installation with an echosounder giving ten times the resolution of regular equipment. That survey revealed submarine canyons that were independent of terrestrial topography and ran seaward to open into a plain.The first SOSUS array and shore station were commissioned at Puerto Rico September 1954. The ship also worked in determining the noise pattern of submarines and an investigation of shallow water acoustics for mine sweeping in the approaches to New York harbor. The ship engaged in other shallow water work off Puerto Rico as a sound source ship. The loss of resulted in a large search effort to locate the wreckage. Task Group 89.7 was formed for the search and was composed of various vessels at different times over the long search period. Allegheny was assigned to the task group from 24 April to 15 May 1963 as part of the \\"fine grain survey\\" group. , assigned to ONR for Project Artemis, was the center for processing data that was delivered by small boats at sea from Allegheny, and Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL) which was equipped with a unique trainable sonar and an electronics laboratory and workshop. The fine grain search area was a square area in which each of the ships was assigned a quadrant for survey with its precision Fathometer. The survey, using the Decca Navigator System met the requirement to cover the entire area with its soundings but expanded the original twelve possible hull parts to ninety. That number of possibles made classification by ships equipped for that task difficult and required further steps to make those ships' search more proficient. Highlighting the latter part of her long tour of research support work was a towing operation—something she had not been configured for in many, many years. Underway from Bayonne on 31 January 1967, Allegheny sailed for Bermuda, arriving on 3 February. No longer possessing a towing engine or fittings, the research vessel had to jury-rig a towing arrangement to the \\"Monster Buoy\\" (General Dynamics Buoy \\"Bravo\\")- Setting out for the west coast of the United States on 11 February, Allegheny and the \\"Monster Buoy\\" headed for the Pacific. Touching briefly at Guantanamo Bay for provisions from 17 to 19 February, Allegheny and her charge transited the Panama Canal on 23 February, and set out for Acapulco on the 25th. En route, the tug and her tow ran into 40-knot winds and 15-foot seas in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, but reached their destination on 4 March. Underway on the 7th, Allegheny delivered her tow one week later, on the 14th, having successfully completed a 32-day, 4,642-mile journey. Retracing her course, the tug returned to Bermuda on 16 April 1967, via Acapulco, the Panama Canal, and Kingston, Jamaica. Allegheny conducted oceanographic research missions off Bermuda with Mission Capistrano from 22 April to 5 May 1967 before sailing for Bayonne.Mission Capistrano was at the time modified to be handle the large active source array for Project Artemis which was conducted at Bermuda with other operations in the Bahamas. Further oceanographic work off Port Everglades, Florida began in June followed by a visit on 4 July 1967 to Washington, D.C. In September 1967 the ship was reassigned from Commandant, 3d Naval District, to Commander Service Squadron 8 (COMSERVRON 8) on 1 July 1969, and conducted coring operations on the Continental Shelf, off the New York-New Jersey coast from 5 to 11 September.The dates without clear years and unclear wording are direct quotes from DANFS. From 18 to 28 September, Allegheny conducted operations with in the Gulf of Maine and Boston area and, from 9 to 20 November with , in the Virginia capes area, each time under the auspices of Commander, Operational Development Force. In 1968 Columbia University decided to phase out Navy related research with the result the Navy withdrew support to Hudson Laboratories and redirected assets to in-house laboratories. A factor in both the university and Navy decision was unrest on campus and a classified and tightly held research effort at the laboratory. The nature of the project, related to SOSUS developments, could not be shared with university management. In the end thirty-five of the researchers went to NRL to continue classified acoustics research. Allegheny and three other naval ships supporting Hudson Laboratories acoustical work, Mission Capistrano, and the coastal work boat Manning (ex Army T-514) were withdrawn and reassigned. In May 1968 Allegheny, along with Mission Capistrano, was among the ships available at the Naval Research Laboratory under COMSERVRON 8 with ONR scheduling. Foremost among the NRL listing was , a new conversion into a much more capable research platform with a center well for safer, all weather operations. Allegheny was declared excess to the needs of the Navy, decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 December 1968. Post naval service The ship was towed to the Inactive Ship Facility at Philadelphia and turned over to Northwestern Michigan College, Traverse City, Michigan to be berthed at the Great Lakes Maritime Academy. For almost a decade the ship served as training ship preparing students for merchant service on the Great Lakes. On 27 January 1978, \\"burdened by frozen spray flung on her superstructure by strong north winds,\\" the ship rolled over at her Maritime Academy dock. As of 2018, the ship is owned by American Tugs Incorporated, based in Puerto Rico, and is operated commercially under the name Alejandro.

Mongolian scholars from Tibet made valuable contributions in Indian academia; for example, Lama Chimpa assisted George de Roerich in compiling a Russian-Sanskrit dictionary. Other noted Mongolian scholars in India from this era include Da-Lama, Rigzin Wangpo, Geshe Wanggyal, Geshe Kaldan, and Geshe Agwang Nima; some remained in Kalimpong, while others left the district to teach at famous universities including the Banaras Hindu University and the University of Delhi. Most continued as monks, but some returned to secular life, married, and had children. Tohtoh, one such young man, studied at the Central Tibetan School in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand before emigrating to the United States, where he was involved in founding the Mongol-American Cultural Association. Direct migration from Mongolia Ties between Mongolia and India were expanded by the efforts of the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche. He was originally from Ladakh in India, but went to Lhasa to study at Drepung Monastery in the 1930s. He was instrumental in reviving Buddhism in Mongolia, arranging the Dalai Lama's visit to Mongolia in 1979, which resulted in an agreement for monks from Mongolia to come to India to study Buddhism. During his service as India's ambassador to Mongolia he encouraged more Mongolian monks to come to India and study at the Institute of Buddhist Dialectics in Dharamsala, in Karnataka at the Drepung Gomang in Mundgod or the Sera Monastery in Bylakuppe, and in other places. Due to his efforts the number of scholarships for Mongolians to study in India expanded from just a few to over one hundred.Sue Byrne.

Under Captains Perkins and Maxwell she also took a considerable number of prizes.National Archives, Kew: ADM 51/1406 Captain's Log HMS Arab 13 September 1800 – 17 May 1801National Archives, Kew: ADM 51/2110 Captain's Log HMS Arab 2 December 1804 – 20 September 1807 After the Royal Navy sold her in 1810 she served as a whaling ship in the South Seas whale fisheries. She made six complete whaling voyages until she was lost in 1824 during her seventh; all her crew were saved. French origins and capture Brave was built in Nantes circa June 1797. She was commissioned under Joseph Robin, and had a crew of 160 men. On 24 April 1798 the 36-gun , under the command of Captain Lawrence William Halsted, captured Brave off Cape Clear. She was pierced for 22 guns and was carrying eighteen, mixed 12 and 18-pounders. Unusually for a privateer, Brave resisted capture, suffering several men killed and 14 wounded before she surrendered. Phoenix had no casualties and suffered trifling damage to her sails and rigging. Brave had a crew of 160 men and also some 50 English prisoners on board, none of whom were injured. Halsted described Brave as being \\"a very fine ship, of 600 Tons, is coppered, and sails exceedingly fast.\\" That she had 50 prisoners on board and only 160 crew indicates that she had taken several British vessels and then put prize crews on board her prizes. French Revolutionary Wars and Treaty of Amiens After Phoenix captured Brave, the British brought her to Plymouth, where she arrived on 12 May. She was named and registered on 24 July 1798 and fitted out between November 1798 and April 1799. During this period a lower deck, quarterdeck and a forecastle were added. She was commissioned as HMS Arab in December 1798 under Commander Peter Spicer.Spicer had been a lieutenant on under Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Capel On 5 January 1799 Captain Thomas Bladen Capel took command of Arab, sailing for Jamaica on 23 April. After arriving in the West Indies, at about midnight on 10 July, she engaged three Spanish frigates off the coast of Havana for about half an hour, losing three of the crew to enemy fire though apparently giving as good as she got thus causing the Spanish to withdraw. It was also during late June and early July 1799 that there was a serious outbreak of yellow fever on board, something from which ten of the Ship's company would die, including its carpenter Jeremiah Driscoll. The journal of the ship's surgeon, Thomas Tappen, contains an interesting and detailed account of the symptoms these men experienced, together with his treatment for the fever, including the use of bloodletting and the administering of calomel.National Archives, Kew: ADM 101/85/41 Journal of Ship's Surgeon HMS Arab 27 March 1799 – 27 March 1800Fairbrother, E. H., 'H.M.S. Arab in the West Indies, 1799', Notes and Queries: A Medium of Intercommunication for Literary Men, General Readers, etc., Twelfth Series Volume XI, No. 222, 15 July 1922, pp.41-42. On 23 August, shared with Arab in the capture of the American ship Porcupine, a brig of 113 tons with a crew of eight men that was sailing from New York to Havana carrying a cargo wine, oil, soap and sundries. Porcupine was condemned but Quebec appealed. During this period Arab on her own also detained, on suspicion, the Spanish brig Esperansa, which was sailing from Carthagena with a cargo of cotton, hides, and so forth. Later, at sea off Cape Canaveral on 11 October, lightning struck Arab, killing three men and splinting her main top mast. Tappen again recorded things in his journal, including the state of one of the men, John Leggett, \\"whose side had the appearance of being burnt, the skin all peeled off, tho the shirt remained entire \\". Before the year was out another severe outbreak of yellow fever struck Arab whilst she was in Jamaica, and by the following January a further twelve of the crew were dead. Perkins An extract from the logbook of HMS Arab. The extract is dated 3 March 1801. The log is available from the National Archives, Kew Cat.

In early 1801 rumours of a diplomatic rift between Britain and Second League of Armed Neutrality started reaching the Caribbean. On 1 March Perkins received orders to stop all Danish, Swedish and Russian ships that he encountered.Donnithorne. Lougen (centre) at the battle of West Kay in combat, with British privateer Experiment and HMS Arab Two days later Arab, in company with the 18-gun British privateer Experiment, caught and challenged two Danish vessels, the brig , under the command of Captain Carl Wilhelm Jessen, and the schooner Den Aarvaagne.The name Den Aarvaagne translates as \\"The Alert\\" or \\"The Watchman\\". Arab approached the two Danish vessels and, according to Danish accounts, without warning, fired several broadsides at Lougen before the Danish ship was able to return fire. Lougen, which had escaped serious damage, began to return fire steadily. Experiment initially attempted to capture Aarvaagne, but Aarvaagne obeyed orders to stay out of the fight and instead escaped south to Christiansted on St. Croix with its intelligence on British actions. Experiment then joined Arab in the attack on Lougen, with the two British ships sandwiching the Danish ship. During the engagement, which lasted for over an hour, one of Lougens shots struck the Arabs cathead and loosed the bower anchor. (Perkin's reported that it was the first shot from Lougen that loosed the bower anchor.) Arab crew was unable to cut the anchor free, leaving Arab unable to manoeuvre effectively. This allowed Jessen to steer a course that brought him under the protection of the shore batteries and then into St Thomas. The Danish government awarded Jessen a presentation sword made of gold, a medal and 400 rixdollars (the equivalent of a whole year's salary) for his actions in escaping from a numerically superior force.Danish Naval History - The Battle at West Kay 1801 Still, Perkins, after having repaired his battle damage, cruised outside the harbour and in a two-week period captured more than a dozen Danish and other foreign vessels. Between 15 March and 7 April 1801, an expedition under Lieutenant-General Thomas Trigge and Admiral Duckworth captured the islands of St. Bartholomew, St. Martin, St. Thomas, and St. Croix. Arab was listed among the vessels participating in the expedition and entitled to a share in the \\"proceeds of sundry articles of provisions, merchandise, stores, and property afloat\\" that had been captured. At that time the British seized both Lougen and Den Aarvaagne. On 13 April Arab captured the Spanish armed schooner Duenda.Clowes, p. 471.Naval History of Great Britain James, (1837), Vol. 3, p. 150. On 16 April 1801 Perkins, in Arab and the newly captured Duenda, together with Colonel Richard Blunt and a detachment of the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), laid siege to and captured the wealthy islands of Sint Eustatius and Saba, capturing their French garrisons, forty-seven cannon and 338 barrels of gunpowder. Eustatia had been the most profitable of the islands in the Dutch West Indies. Command of Arab passed to Captain Robert Fanshawe in 1802. Fanshawe took her back to Plymouth, where she spent between August and December being repaired and refitted. After a brief period spent laid up she was brought back into service with the resumption of war with France. Napoleonic Wars=Cochrane Arab was recommissioned in October 1803 under Captain Lord Cochrane, who had been assigned to Arab by Earl St Vincent. In his autobiography, Cochrane compared the Arab to a collier, and his first thoughts on seeing her being repaired at Plymouth were that she would \\"sail like a haystack\\".Cochrane Britannia's Sea Wolf, Thomas, p.82 Under Cochrane's command Arab twice collided with Royal Navy ships, first with the 12-gun , and then with the storeship . Despite his misgivings, Cochrane still managed to intercept and board an American merchant ship, the Chatham, thereby creating an international incident that led to the consignment of Arab and her commander to fishing fleet protection duties beyond Orkney in the North Sea, an assignment that Cochrane bitterly complained about.Autobiography of a Seaman, Cochrane, p. 90 Cochrane would later refer to his time in the Arab in the North Sea and the Downs as \\"naval exile in a dreary tub\\".The Audacious Admiral Cochrane, Vale, p. 37 Maxwell Captain Keith Maxwell replaced Cochrane in 1805, and sailed Arab to serve with the squadron off Boulogne. On 18 July the British spotted the French Boulogne flotilla sailing along the shore. Captain Edward Owen of HMS Immortalite sent , Fleche, Arab and the brigs , , and in pursuit of 22 large schooners flying the Dutch flag. As Maxwell came close to shore he found the water barely deep enough to keep Arab from running aground. Still, the British managed to force three of the schooners to ground on the Banc de Laine near Cap Gris Nez; their crews ran two others ashore.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.131-2. The British also drove six French gun-vessels on shore. However, the bank off Cape Grinez, and the shot and shells from the right face of its powerful battery, soon compelled the British to move back from the shore. Arab suffered seven wounded and a great deal of damage. Fleche was the closest inshore owing to her light draft of water; she had five men severely wounded and damage to her rigging.James (1837) Vol. III, pp.311-2. At some point a shell from a shore battery hit Arabs main-mast-head and then fell to the gun deck. At first a seaman named Clorento tried to defuse the shell. While he was doing this master's mate Edward Mansell and two more seamen came up. Together they got the shell into the sea, where it exploded. The next day Arab buried her dead at sea, after which the men on Immortalite cheered Arab.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, Part 2, p.888. Maxwell wrote to the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's, drawing its attention to the heroism of the four men. Thereafter, the Fund voted Mansell £50 and the three other seamen £20 each. The fund gave an additional £125 for Maxwell to divide between eight other crewmen in graduated amounts.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 25, pp.390-3. On 22 September 1805 she left St Helens, Isle of Wight. She arrived at Funchal Roads on 12 October, having with , convoyed the slave ship and some other vessels.Corry (1807), pp.28 & 32. In December Arab and Favourite were off the west coast of Africa. Subsequently, Arab returned to the West Indies. During her time in the West Indies Lieutenant Edward Dix, as acting captain, temporarily replaced Maxwell for a period of five weeks in 1806. Two days after Dix joined Arab, yellow fever broke out which the crew of Arab, except Dix and eight others, contracted; 33 men died.Gentleman's magazine and historical chronicle, Vol. 8, pp.427-8. Maxwell resumed command and returned to Spithead in 1807 where Arabs remaining crew were paid off. Disposal The Navy then placed Arab in ordinary at Woolwich. The principal officers and commissioners of His Majesty's Navy sold her at Deptford on 20 September 1810. Whaler The supplement to Lloyd's Register for 1811 describes Arab, 500 tons, French prize, at London, Hill, master, and the whaling company Mather & Co. as owner.Lloyd's Register, 1811, Supplement, Seq. № 43 However, there is no record that she sailed for Mather & Co. Arab did engage in whaling and sealing voyages from 1813 until she was lost in 1824, but for Daniel Bennett. An addendum to the entry for Arab in the 1813 Lloyd's Register gave her new master as \\"Brown\\". This is John Brown.Lloyd's Register, 1813, № 1103 Ownership changed in 1813 and the new owner was Daniel Bennett, who would remain Arabs owner for seven voyages.British Southern Whale Fishery Database – voyages: Arab. On her first voyage for Bennett, Brown sailed Arab to the South Seas whale fisheries on 22 September 1813. He visited the Desolation Islands, returning to London on 23 June 1815. Arab and Brown then sailed for the South Seas again on 26 June 1815. She returned on 21 May 1816 with 580 casks and 25 cases of seal skins. For her next three voyages for Bennett, Arabs master was George Barclay (or Berkley). For her third voyage, Arab left London on 4 July 1816, and returned on 19 March 1817. On her fourth voyage, Arab left London on 10 June 1817. She returned on 27 March 1818 with 600 casks. On her fifth voyage, Arab left on 2 June 1818, bound for South Georgia She returned on 6 May 1819 with 300 casks and 5000 seal skins. Arabs master for sixth voyage was Allen, and her destination was Walvis Bay. In March 1820 she was reported to have 1800 barrels. By 14 August she was back at Walfish [Walvis] Bay. She sailed for England, but on 24 October she was reported to grounded on Margate Sands. She was refloated and reached London on 27 October. Loss For what was her seventh voyage, which turned out to be her last, Arab was under the command of Captain Alexander Sinclair. She left on 9 April 1821 for New Zealand. She was reported to be at the Bay of Islands and to have loaded 350 barrels. She left from \\"Fenning's Island\\" (possibly Fanning's Island), and by 11 June was in a sinking state with nine feet of water in her hold. Fortunately, she encountered Ocean, Harrison, master, at .Lloyd's List 16 July 1724, №5925. Ocean had left Port Jackson in February 1824 bound for London. While en route she weathered a large gale but she lost her livestock overboard. When she encountered Arab, she was able to rescue Arabs 36-man crew before Arab sank with her cargo of 300 tons of sperm oil. Ocean went on to Saint Helena to undertake repairs and buy provisions. Ocean arrived in London in July 1824. Notes, citations, and references=NotesCitationsReferences *Clayton, Jane M.

The oil painting depicts Picasso's friend and fellow painter, Angel Fernandez de Soto, in a bar with a glass of absinthe. The painting was previously owned by musical theatre composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. On 23 June 2010, the painting was sold at auction for £34.7 million. Background Portrait of Angel Fernández de Soto is a study of a young Spanish artist sitting in a bar, shrouded in tobacco smoke from a pipe, with a glass of absinthe in front of him. The young man, Fernández de Soto, was Picasso's friend and was usually referred to as an \\"amusing wastrel\\", as he enjoyed drinking and partying. Picasso met Fernández de Soto in 1899 and they twice shared studios in Barcelona. The portrait gives an insight into the life of Picasso and his circle of friends, and Picasso immortalized Fernández de Soto in several of his paintings, some of which are now held in the Museu Picasso in Barcelona. Fernández de Soto was later killed in the Spanish Civil War. The Andrew Lloyd Webber Art Foundation purchased the painting for £18 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York City in 1995. The painting was included in a selection of works from Lloyd Webber's collection, which was exhibited at London's Royal Academy of Arts in 2003. Dispute over ownership In 2006, Lloyd Webber announced that he would be selling Portrait of Angel Fernandez de Soto at auction for charity. However, the painting was withdrawn from auction after a claim that the previous owner was forced to sell it under duress from the Nazi regime in Germany. The previous owner's family reached an out-of- court settlement with the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation, which allowed the foundation to retain ownership of the painting and to be free to sell the work. 2010 auction In March 2010, it was announced that Lloyd Webber had made the decision to auction off the painting to benefit his arts, culture and heritage charity foundation. The painting was to be included in a Christie's auction of Impressionist and Modern art in London on 23 June 2010. The painting became the most highly estimated work of art to be offered at auction in Europe, with a pre-sale estimate of between £30–40 million. Jussi Pylkkänen, president of Christie's Europe division said the painting is \\"one of the most important works of art to be offered at auction in decades\\". On 23 June 2010, the painting came to auction and was sold for £34.7 million to an anonymous telephone bidder.

The politikon coinage is a series of Byzantine billon coins, struck around the middle of the 14th century, which are distinguished by the Greek inscription +ΠΟΛΙΤΙΚΟΝ (\\"of the city, civic\\"). The iconography of many examples, with the legend surrounding a large cross or a bust of the Virgin Mary, follows Western European models rather than those of traditional Byzantine coinage, and most of them do not identify the Byzantine emperor under whom they were struck.. They conform, however, to the general type of the widespread tornese coins, with a weight of 0.6–0.8 grams, a diameter of 17 mm and silver content of 0.200–0.250. Initially they were concave but later issues are flat. They apparently form the continuation of the Byzantine tornese issue (known in Greek as tournesion) of Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328), and like them were probably rated at 96 to the gold hyperpyron.; . Some bear the name of Andronikos III Palaiologos (r. 1328–1341) and can thus be dated to the 1330s, the anonymous series could be dated to the 1340s (marked by a destructive civil war), and the last issues, featuring John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1376 and 1379–1391) would date to the 1350s, after which time the type was discontinued. There are a few exceptions however. A politikon currently in the Cabinet des Médailles in Paris weighs 1.4 grams and has a silver content of 0.785, far higher than the ordinary tornese but still below the main Byzantine silver coin, the basilikon. A few others conform to two of the billon politikon types, but are large, thick, and heavy (circa 2 grams) copper coins, whose function is unclear.. The meaning and rationale behind the unique +ΠΟΛΙΤΙΚΟΝ inscription, as well as the place where the coins were minted, have been long debated. It seems that the inscription indicates that these coins were struck to pay some public need (like contemporary French coins marked BVRGENSIS). Earlier scholars, starting with Gustave Schlumberger, advocated a use as tickets for the bread dole, but today they are seen as true coinage.. The coins are generally considered to have been minted at Constantinople, but due to their \\"Western\\" appearance it has been variously suggested that they were struck at a provincial mint in the vicinity of the Frankish states of southern Greece. The type, however, is entirely absent from local finds in this area, and its Constantinopolitan origin seems secure..

Early work on Colostrinin Colostrinin was originally identified by scientists working in Poland in the 1970s. Colostrinin is derived from colostrum, which is present in the pre-milk fluid produced from mammary glands in the first few days after parturition. It is also known as proline-rich polypeptides, since sequence analysis of the peptides present in this mixture reveals an unusually high proportion of this amino acid residue. The amino acid compositions of Colostrinin from ovine, bovine, and human colostrum are very similar. Colostrinin was first characterized in animal and in-vitro studies as a substance that generally stimulates the immune response. Such an immunomodulatory action may be important in the treatment of a variety of diseases and is consistent with the beneficial effect of colostrum in promoting the development of the immune system in newborn mammals. Preparation and synthesis Colostrinin is obtained from bovine colostrum by alcohol extraction and filtration. A patented method outlines the steps that can be used to produce this substance on an industrial scale. In this method, an alcohol, such as ethanol or methanol, is used to create an alcohol phase. This phase is enriched with the peptide fraction, from which Colostrinin is recovered and purified. Colostrinin is incompletely defined chemically. Initially, it was assumed to consist of a single protein with a molecular weight of approximately 17 to 18 kDa. However, subsequent studies showed that Colostrinin largely consists of a mixture of at least 32 peptides ranging in size from 0.5 to 3 kDa. Most of the peptides appear to be derived from proteolytic processing of the milk proteins β-casein and a β-casein homolog. Whether non-peptide components of the mixture contribute to the biological activity is unknown. However, the biological activity of Colostrinin does seem to be due to more than one of the components, since its effects cannot be completely mimicked by any one of the peptide components tested so far. Health benefits PRP-rich preparations from bovine colostrum have shown possible efficacy against various illnesses including neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's), viral infections, and ailments characterized by an overactive immune system, such as allergies, asthma and autoimmune diseases. Some recent research has also indicated possible efficacy in combating obesity. Colostrinin's potential as a cognitive enhancer is fairly well-documented. Significant research has been done on Colostrinin's possible efficacy in Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. The disease is characterized by extracellular senile plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid-beta (Aß) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, containing the cytoskeletal protein tau. A placebo-controlled clinical trial with Colostrinin in 106 people with Alzheimer's over 30 weeks was completed in 2002 and the results appeared to demonstrate efficacy in a significant proportion of patients treated. The results showed that approximately 40% of patients on Colostrinin were stabilized or improved after 15 weeks of therapy, based on an Analysis of Overall Response. 33% of patients continued to show stabilization or improvement after 30 weeks of treatment, although levels of benefit were slightly higher at the 15-week stage of the trial. The dosage regimen used for the trial was 100 micrograms of Colostrinin administered every second day for three weeks followed by a two-week period without Colostrinin. A 2010 study demonstrated that Colostrinin significantly relieved amyloid-beta (Aß)-induced cytotoxicity, alleviated the effect of Aß-induced cytotoxicity and caused a significant reduction in the elevated levels of the antioxidant enzyme SOD1. An in-vitro study completed in 2005 showed that Colostrinin can increase the lifespan of cells isolated from inbred mice predisposed to premature aging and death.I. Boldogh; A. Bacsi; L. Agulera- Aguirre; P. German; M. Kruzel; Colostrinin Increases the Lifespan and Neurological Performance of Mice, 03, 2008. This study showed the effect of Colostrinin on the mitochondria of cells isolated from strains of senescence- prone (SAMP1) and senescence-resistant (SAMR1) mice. The data showed that cells from SAMP1 mice produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS), exhibit severe mitochondrial dysfunction, and have a decreased lifespan compared to the cells from SAMR1 mice. Addition of Colostrinin to SAMP1 cells significantly decreased ROS levels, normalized mitochondrial function and increased the lifespan to levels similar to those in SAMR1 cells. This in- vitro effect was followed up in actual mice as well. Another study showed that Colostrinin induces neurite outgrowth of pheochromocytoma cells and inhibits beta amyloid-induced apoptosis. The neurite outgrowth caused by Colostrinin appears to activate signaling pathways common to cell proliferation and differentiation, and to mediate a wide spectrum of activities that are similar to those of hormones and known nerve growth factors. These findings would seem to suggest that Colostrinin treatment may control the expression of genes that are involved in the development, maintenance, and regeneration of neurons in the central nervous system, and thus may also explain the improvements observed in Alzheimer's patients with mild-to-moderate dementia during treatment with Colostrinin. Colostrinin affects the early stages of Vitamin D3-induced phenotypic (CD11b and CD14) and functional (phagocytic) differentiation/maturation of monocytes/macrophages. When Colostrinin was administered to the cells after treatment with Vitamin D3, no attenuation of the differentiation/maturation process of the HL-60 cells was observed. Therefore, Colostrinin may regulate in this way the inflammatory processes in which these cells participate. Another study in day-old domestic chicks showed enhancement of long-term memory retention. A study conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch and published online in March 2008 in the International Archives of Allergy and Immunology showed that Colostrinin is non-allergenic and can prevent allergic inflammation due to common indoor and outdoor allergens. The study used a well characterized mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. Colostrinin (given orally, intranasally or intraperitoneally) significantly decreased IgE/IgG1 production, airway eosinophilia, mucin production and hypersensitivity induced by allergenic extracts from ragweed pollen and house dust mites. In contrast, colostrum induced positive inflammatory responses. Anti-aging potential A 2006 study published in the Journal of Experimental Therapeutics and Oncology indicated that Colostrinin may affect the aging process by reducing the spontaneous or induced mutation frequency in the DNA of cells. Such DNA damage is implicated in the general process of aging. The study, which was performed in both hamster and human cells, looked at the effect of Colostrinin on the frequency of defined DNA mutations in these cells as they occur naturally and when induced by various known chemical or physical agents. In cells stressed oxidatively, Colostrinin reduced the frequency of mutation induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to nearly background levels in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, Colostrinin reduced the frequency of mutation caused by two mutagenic agents, methyl methane sulfonate and mitomycin-C, the latter often used in cancer chemotherapy. Notably Colostrinin decreased UVA and UVB radiation induced mutation frequency. These damaging radiations are a natural part of sunlight. UVA radiation plays a role in the induction of malignant melanoma and UVB radiation is the primary cause of squamous cell carcinomas. It is suggested that the antimutagenic properties of Colostrinin are achieved via multiple mechanisms - by decreasing intracellular levels of ROS and so preventing DNA damage and by increasing the efficiency of natural DNA repair mechanisms. There were also studies of the Colostrinin components and their possible effect on aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta1-42). Results presented suggest that NP - Colostrinin component, can directly interact with amyloid beta, inhibit its aggregation and disrupt existing aggregates acting as a beta sheet breaker and reduce toxicity induced by aggregated forms of Abeta. Toxicity There has been very little mention of toxicity in most published animal studies using Colostrinin, which may suggest that it exhibits low toxicity. Generally, treatment with Colostrinin in clinical studies has been well tolerated by both animals and humans, with any side-effects being mild and transient. Use by humans Tablets or capsules containing Colostrinin are available in many countries in the world and are sold as an OTC dietary supplement under various trade names, including Colostrinin, MemoryAid, CogniSure, Cognase, Cognate and Dyna.
