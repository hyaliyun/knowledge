The concept was first created by VLTOR Weapon Systems of Tucson, Arizona, and released through Noveske Rifleworks of Grants Pass, Oregon, before being published open sourced in the public domain for adoption by the entire firearms accessory industry. The name \\"KeyMod\\" was coined by Eric Kincel (then working for VLTOR Weapon Systems) following the naming trend of other VLTOR accessories with the suffix \\"Mod\\" meaning modular, and \\"Key\\" being a reference to the key-hole profile of the mounting slots. Description KeyMod is an open-source design released for use and distribution in the public domain in an effort to standardize universal attachment systems in the firearm accessories market. The KeyMod system is intended to be used as a direct attachment method for firearm accessories such as flash light mounts, laser modules, sights, scope mounts, vertical grips, rail panels, hand stops, barricade supports, and many others. The goal is to eliminate the need for the rail to be fully outfitted with 1913 rails covering the entire handguard. The KeyMod system allows a user to place MIL-STD-1913 rails wherever needed (even in the 45¬∞ positions at times). The KeyMod system consists of two parts: the KeyMod slot and the KeyMod nut. The slot is distinctive with a larger diameter through-hole combined with a narrow slot. The slot is chamfered on the backside while the through hole is sized for clearance of a quick-detach sling swivel (approximately 3/8\\" diameter). The nut is stepped and the larger diameter end is chamfered around 270 degrees of its diameter. The angled face created is meant to interface with the chamfer on the backside of the KeyMod slot. The full diameter is left intact to create two flats on the nut which align the nut to the slot, and allow it to be indexed to the accessory as well as to the KeyMod slot. This eliminates the need to align the nuts to the holes prior to accessory installation as well as the need for tools to tighten the screw/nut. In most accessories, the screw is swaged after assembly to ensure that it cannot be backed out of the nut. This prevents loss of small parts (screws, nuts or other small parts used in the assembly of the accessory). The spacing of the holes is critical and is based on MIL-STD-1913 spacing to allow the greatest modularity with existing accessories. The KeyMod specifications call out a \\"recoil lug\\" on the accessories which is intended to interface with the larger through hole portion and resist slippage of accessories during counter-recoil. The combination of the angled interface of the nut to the KeyMod slot and the recoil lug to the through hole make for a very strong attachment point which will not slip under harsh recoil or counter recoil. It also provides for an excellent return-to-zero when removed and re-installed. History VLTOR Weapon Systems had previously pursued a design which was the basis for the KeyMod system. While developing the first prototype systems Eric Kincel of VLTOR Weapon systems was approached by John Noveske of Noveske Rifleworks with a design for a universal accessory attachment system. After a short collaboration, during which Todd Krawczyk of Noveske Rifleworks suggested an improvement to the accessory lock/anti-rotation nut, John Noveske decided to adopt what became the KeyMod system for the NSR series of hand guards and accessories. Kincel's design was developed simultaneously, but without knowledge of the independently developed keyhole slot system by Accuracy International, until after KeyMod's release. The specifications for the KeyMod system were first published in July 2012. The current revision was released in October 2012. Technical specifications The specifications for the KeyMod system were initially released by VLTOR Weapon Systems as an open-source set of drawings. As such, some manufacturers have added their own variations on the system such as using the through-hole portion as a sling-swivel attachment point. The critical interface dimensions, however, still follow the specifications. In an effort to ensure interface dimensions are kept consistent and repeatable, Bravo Company MFG released a set of drawings for KeyMod gauges that allow for expedient inspection of the 100¬∞ chamfer feature in January 2014.

He is the president of the British Muslim Initiative (BMI) and currently resides in London, to which he fled from the West Bank in 1990, using forged documents to escape Israeli security authorities. Before emigrating to the UK, Sawalha was Hamas‚Äôs West Bank military chief. In addition, he supervised the allocation and supply of large amounts of money to Hamas operatives, an activity that led to his being named in a 2004 U.S. indictment against Hamas operative Muhammad Salah. In addition to his work with Hamas and BMI, Sawalha is a frequent guest on the Islamist Al-Hiwar television station, and is affiliated with numerous Palestinian and Islamic charities. He has had a hand in organizing several of the flotillas and land convoys attempting to reach the Gaza Strip, through which he has transferred financial aid to Hamas. Sawalha helped found the Muslim Association of Britain and is also a trustee of the Finsbury Park Mosque. In addition, he signed the 2009 Istanbul Declaration, which reaffirms jihad as the proper means to achieving goals such as unifying Israel under Palestinian control. Early life and education Sawalha was born in Tubas, West Bank, in 1961. Sawalha studied religion at Amman University beginning in 1980. Early activities in the West Bank In 1988, after studying at Amman University, Sawalha returned to the West Bank, where he lived in Al-Bireh until 1990. He taught at a religious school in Al-Ram and later at the Islamic college (Kuliyat al-Da‚Äôwah) in Jerusalem and in Beit Hanina. Sawalha was a senior Hamas activist in the West Bank, and helped establish Hamas' West Bank headquarters in 1989-90. He also instructed regional Hamas commanders to set up military networks, establishing links between local operatives who had not yet been detained and operatives in the United States. After the exposure of his Hamas infrastructure in the West Bank, Israeli security forces declared him a wanted operative. Wanted by Israel, in October 1990 he used forged documents to escape to Jordan, and from there moved on to Britain. He continues to carry out anti-Israeli activities from there. Activities in Britain During his first years in Britain, Sawalha continued his operations and sought to consolidate his position as a senior external operative for Hamas. He maintained contact with operatives in the United States, Syria and the West Bank. Later he would see his active role in Hamas diminish, although his pro-Hamas and anti-Israeli activities have continued. He was a founder of the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), and ran it from 1999 to 2007. Later he served as chairman of the British Muslim Initiative. He was described on a Hamas website as head of the International Committee to Lift the Siege on the Gaza Strip. In 2009 he reportedly was named deputy chairman of the Popular Committee in Support of the Palestinian People. He also signed the 2009 Istanbul Declaration. Sawalha has been involved in organizing flotillas and land convoys to the Gaza Strip while in Britain. Additionally, a BBC program alleged that he had directed funds both for Hamas' armed and missionary wings. Sawalha has been engaged in lawfare against Israel, which takes advantage of Britain's universal jurisdiction law to file criminal complaints against Israeli officials. 2004 U.S. indictment of Salah A Department of Justice press release names Sawalha as a co-conspirator in the 2004 indictment of Muhammad Salah. Among the aliases mentioned in the indictment are ‚ÄúMuhammad Khadhem Sawalha,‚Äù ‚ÄúAbu Obeida,‚Äù ‚ÄúAbu Ubada,‚Äù ‚ÄúAbu Ubaydah,‚Äù ‚ÄúAbu Ubeida,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAbu Obadah‚Äù. It was reported that Saleh met and spoke with Abu Marzook and Sawalha, who had been in charge of Hamas operations within the West Bank, regarding the need for a resurgence in Hamas operations in the West Bank. During the meeting, Sawalha identified specific Hamas members who could be used to revitalize Hamas's activities, including Awadallah and Saleh al- Arouri. Sawalha told Salah on several occasion to provide money to Hamas operatives on the West Bank, and Salah passed along information to Sawalha as well. Around December 1992, a U.S.-based Hamas member gave pictures of co- conspirator Adel Awadallah, who was on the run from Israeli authorities, to Salah so that Salah could have a false passport made for Awadallah. Sawalha reportedly told Salah explicit instructions as to how to dress and behave when distributing funds to local Hamas operatives. On January 13, 1993, en route from the U.S. to the Middle East, Salah met in London with Sawalha, who instructed Salah to provide money to various Hamas members. Salah was eventually indicted for his Hamas role, and in January 1995 pleaded guilty to participating in Hamas affairs, admitting that he had represented Sawalha and had been appointed head of military operations in the West Bank at the request of Abu Marzook and Sawalha. Another report mentioned in the indictment noted the provision of $400,000 to one 'Brother Mohammed Kadhim,' an alias for Sawalha. Assassination of Sheikh Yassin Sawalha spoke out in 2004 against Israel's assassination of Sheikh Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, saying that Shaykh Ahmad Yassin ‚Äúlived with his people and died in the service of their cause.‚Äù British Muslim Initiative Sawalha is one of the founders of the BMI, which describes itself as follows: ‚ÄúFormed by justice, peace and human rights campaigners, the British Muslim Initiative (BMI) is an organisation which seeks to fight racism and Islamophobia, combat the challenges Muslims face around the world, encourage Muslim participation in British public life, and improve relations between the West and the Muslim world.‚Äù The BMI supported the Global March to Jerusalem. In 2009, demonstrators protesting the Gaza attacks clashed with police, and nearly all those arrested were Muslims. Sawalha questioned this disproportion, and also questioned the detainees' treatment. He said the BMI ‚Äúencourages Muslims to express their feelings and ambitions and frustrations only through political and legal processes. But if anything sends the message that Muslims cannot express themselves through political processes, and they will not be dealt with like others, it will give more strength to the fringes within the community who say democracy and the political system doesn't apply to Muslims in this country. This will only increase the frustration and sense of alienation among these people.‚Äù Sawalha and the BMI supported the January 2012 developments in Bangladesh, condemning the International Crimes Tribunal. Gaza flotillas After the 2009 Gaza flotilla, Sawalha said that the next convoy would avoid the type of confrontation that had occurred with Egypt: ‚Äúthe confrontation will be directly with the Zionist enemy itself on the high seas.‚Äù Interviewed on Iranian PressTV about the 2011 flotilla, Sawalha said: ‚ÄúNow the Israelis have to understand that their policies and crimes will not make us turn away and go back. We will continue under any circumstances until we break the siege on Gaza.‚Äù Sawalha organized the autumn 2010 LifeLine 5 convoy to Gaza, which reportedly delivered $5 million of aid to the Hamas government.

Early life and education B√∏necke was born in Copenhagen where he trained as a mason under his father while in the same time training as an architect at N. H. and Niels Sigfred Nebelong studio. He then went abroad where he first spend several years at the building school Holzminden before working for four years as a draughtman for Theophil Hansen in Vienna. He then continued his travels for another two years, mainly in Italy. Career The Lime Tower The Well House After his return to Denmark in 1865, B√∏necke settled as a master mason in Copenhagen but soon received a considerable amount of architectural assignments. In 1871, in collaboration with V. Friederichsen, he won third prize in the competition for the new Royal Danish Theatre at Kongens Nytorv. In 1863, he was appointed to Building Inspector in Copenhagen and from 1888 to 1913 he served as Stadsbygmester (\\"City Builder\\"). In 1979 he drafted a proposal for a new building act which later formed the basis for the Copenhagen Building Act of 1889 He continued his private practice besides his public offices. He worked for Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen on several projects. Their first collaboration was on an orangery (known as Pompeii) completed in 1876 for Jacobsen's home, now known as Carlsberg Academy. He also designed Carlsberg Lighthouse and the new main entrance (Stjerneporten, \\"Star Gate\\") to Old Carlsberg. It has previously been believed that he also designed the Palm House at Copenhagen Botanical Garden in collaboration with J. C. Jacobsen who sponsored its construction but it has now been established that it was most likely designed by Christian Hansen. In 1885, he designed the small Well House in the Royal Danish Horticultural Society's Garden. Private life B√∏necke married Augusta Vilhelmine Lorentze n√©e Bi√∏rn on 3 June 1866.

NATO runs a number of programs which provide a framework for the partnerships between itself and these non-member nations, typically based on that country's location. These include the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the Partnership for Peace. Europe Six EU member states, all who have declared their non-alignment with military alliances, are not NATO members: Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Malta, and Sweden. Additionally, Switzerland, which is surrounded by the EU, has also maintained their neutrality by remaining a non-EU-member. All these countries except Cyprus have joined the Partnership for Peace programme, while Sweden and Finland signed a specific host country support agreement with NATO in 2014. NATO has also diplomatic relations with the 5 European microstates: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City. Armenia Armenia has maintained positive relations with NATO members and has signed up for the Partnership for Peace programme, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the Individual Partnership Action Plan. However, Armenia is unlikely to join NATO as its policies often align it closer with Russia, and it remains a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Armenia pulled out of its participation in NATO military exercises in Georgia on 8 May 2009, because of NATO's Secretary-General's alleged support of Azerbaijan, possibly making it even less likely that Armenia will eventually join NATO. Armenia does however participate in certain NATO peacekeeping operations. Armenia deploys approximately 130 soldiers in Afghanistan, as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). They are serving under German command protecting an airport in Konduz. Azerbaijan According to a NATO diplomatic source in August 2009 some key officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels were pushing hard for engaging Azerbaijan on the membership question. \\"Turkey, Romania, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and the Baltic states\\" are among the members backing a fast track for Azerbaijan's NATO membership. While President Ilham Aliyev has generally supported non-belligerency (though not neutrality due to the unresolved conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh) since his rise to power in 2003, Azerbaijan has hosted NATO military exercises and high-profile meetings in 2009. The unresolved conflict over Nagorno- Karabakh would present a major roadblock to membership. Azerbaijan made its policy of not being aligned with a geopolitical/military structure official when it became a full member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 2011. Cyprus Cyprus is the only EU member state that is neither a NATO member state nor a member of the PfP program. The Parliament of Cyprus voted in February 2011 to apply for membership in the program, but President Demetris Christofias vetoed the decision as it would hamper his attempts to negotiate an end to the Cyprus dispute and demilitarize the island. Turkey, a full member of NATO, is likely to veto any attempt by Cyprus to engage with NATO until the dispute is resolved. The winner of Cyprus' presidential election in February 2013, Nicos Anastasiades, has stated that he intends to apply for membership in the PfP program soon after taking over. The current foreign minister Nicos Christodoulides has dismissed Cypriot membership of NATO or Partnership for Peace, preferring to keep Cyprus‚Äô foreign and defence affairs within the framework of the European Union. Finland Finland participates in nearly all sub-areas of the Partnership for Peace programme, and has provided peacekeeping forces to both the Afghanistan and Kosovo missions. However, a 2005 poll indicated that the public was strongly against NATO membership. The possibility of Finland's membership in NATO was one of the most important issues debated in relation to the Finnish presidential election of 2006. The main opposition candidate in the 2006 election, Sauli Niinist√∂ of the National Coalition Party, supported Finland joining a \\"more European\\" NATO. Fellow right-winger Henrik Lax of the Swedish People's Party likewise supported the concept. On the other side, president Tarja Halonen of the Social Democratic Party opposed changing the status quo, as did most other candidates in the election. Her victory and re-election to the post of president has currently put the issue of a NATO membership for Finland on hold for at least the duration of her term. Finland could however change its official position on NATO membership after the new EU treaty clarifies if there will be any new EU- level defence deal, but in the meantime Finnish Defence Forces are making technical preparations for membership, stating that it would increase Finland's security. Currently no political party explicitly supports NATO membership. Other political figures of Finland who have weighed in with opinions include former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari who has argued that Finland should join all the organizations supported by other Western democracies in order \\"to shrug off once and for all the burden of Finlandization\\". Another ex-president, Mauno Koivisto, opposes the idea, arguing that NATO membership would ruin Finland's relations with Russia. Finland has received some very critical feedback from Russia for even considering the possibility of joining NATO, with a 2009 study suggesting this could have repercussions for Russia's relations with the EU and NATO as a whole. In October 2009, Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen reiterated that Finland had no plans to join NATO, and stated that the main lesson of the 2008 South Ossetia war was the need for closer ties to Russia.Deeper Russia Ties Is Georgia War Lesson, Finnish Premier Says Bloomberg Retrieved on 9 October 2009 In September 2014, Finland signed an agreement with NATO that allows NATO and Finland to hold joint exercises on Finnish soil and permits assistance from NATO members in situations such as \\"disasters, disruptions, and threats to security.\\" As such, Finland (and Sweden) participated in the 2015 NATO-led Arctic Challenge Exercise. Ireland Ireland has been a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme since 1999, and is a member of the alliance's Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), but has never officially applied to join as a full NATO member due to its traditional policy of military neutrality. Ireland participates in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP), which aims to increase the interoperability of the Irish military, the Defence Forces, with other NATO member states and bring them into line with accepted international standards so as to successfully deploy with other professional military forces on peacekeeping operations overseas. Irish government policy for the deployment of troops to NATO-led missions requires that the missions be mandated by the United Nations (UN Security Council resolution or UN General Assembly resolution), cabinet-backed and approved by D√°il √âireann (the Irish parliament). This is known as Ireland's \\"triple lock\\". Ireland supplied a limited number of troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan (2001-2014) and supports the ongoing NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR), as these were sanctioned by UNSC resolutions. Public opinion in Ireland continues to favour a policy of neutrality in armed conflicts, and currently no major political party fully supports ascension into NATO. There has been, and continues to be, a number of politicians who support Ireland joining NATO, mainly within the centre-right Fine Gael party, but the majority of politicians still do not. It is widely understood that a referendum would have to be held before any changes could be made to neutrality or to joining NATO. Former Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen said during a visit to the country in 2013 that the \\"door is open\\" for Ireland to join NATO at any time. Kosovo Kosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012, though its lack of recognition by four NATO member states could impede its accession. Moldova Bulboaca with US and NATO expertsalt= Six soldiers dressed in camouflage and face paint sit on top of a green vehicle. Moldova does not currently have plans to join NATO. It has participated in the Partnership for Peace programme and the Individual Partnership Action Plan. The former communist government was seen as more allied with Russia and is already a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In April 2009 Moldova announced it would not participate in the June NATO military exercises. The new ruling party, the Alliance for European Integration, elected in the July 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election, has declined to so far take any action to either move it toward membership, or withdraw from the Commonwealth of Independent States, and denies plans to do either. Moldova also has an ongoing internal conflict with the territory of Transnistria. Russia In April 2009, the Polish Foreign Minister, Rados≈Çaw Sikorski, suggested including Russia in NATO. In March 2010 this suggestion was repeated in an open letter co-written by German defense experts General Klaus Naumann, Frank Elbe, Ulrich Weisser, and former German Defense Minister Volker R√ºhe. In the letter it was suggested that Russia was needed in the wake of an emerging multi-polar world in order for NATO to counterbalance emerging Asian powers.Ex-minister wants to bring Russia into NATO Der Spiegel Retrieved on 9 March 2010 However Russian leadership has made it clear that Russia does not plan to join the alliance, preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level. The Russian envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, is quoted as saying \\"Great powers don't join coalitions, they create coalitions. Russia considers itself a great power,\\" although he said that Russia did not rule out membership at some point in the future. Serbia Serbia originally determined in 2005, as Serbia and Montenegro, to join NATO. The subsequent independence of Montenegro and Kosovo have strained relations between Serbia and NATO. Serbia however joined the Partnership for Peace programme during the 2006 Riga Summit. While this programme is sometimes the first step towards full NATO membership, it is uncertain whether Serbia perceives it as signaling an intent to join the alliance. NATO historically fought Bosnian-Serbian forces during the Bosnia war and Serbia during the 1999 Kosovo conflict. eng. I do not want NATO) Anti- NATO signs in Serbia in 2011 Following NATO's open support to Kosovo's declaration of independence in January 2008, support for NATO integration greatly dropped. An earlier poll in September 2007 had showed that 28% of Serbian citizens supported NATO membership, with 58% supporting the Partnership for Peace. The only political parties which currently support NATO integration are the minor opposition Liberal Democratic Party and Serbian Renewal Movement. The Democratic Party abandoned its pro-NATO attitude, claiming the Partnership for Peace is enough. Although current Serbian priorities do not include NATO membership, the Alliance has offered Serbia an invitation to enter the intensified dialogue programme whenever the country is ready. On 1 October 2008, Serbian Defence Minister Dragan ≈†utanovac signed the Information Exchange Agreement with the NATO, one of the prerequisites for fuller membership in the Partnership for Peace programme. Sweden In 1949 Sweden chose not to join NATO and declared a security policy aiming for non- alignment in peace and neutrality in war. A modified version now qualifies non-alignment in peace for possible neutrality in war. As such, the Swedish government decided not to participate in the membership of NATO because they wanted to remain neutral in a potential war. This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s however there has been an active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the post‚ÄìCold War world. Sweden joined Partnership for Peace in 1994. These ideological divides were visible again in November 2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response Force. While the governing parties in Sweden have opposed membership, they have participated in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF) and Libya (Operation Unified Protector). The Swedish left bloc, including the Social Democratic party, the Green party and the Left party have remained in favor of non-alignment. The Alliance, including the Moderate Party, the Centre party, the conservative Christian Democrats as well as the Liberal party make up the Swedish parties with representation in the parliament today that are in favor of NATO membership. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt stated on 18 September 2007 that Swedish membership in NATO would require a \\"very wide\\" majority in Parliament, including the social democrats, and coordination with Finland. Sweden signed in 2014, and ratified in 2016, a host country agreement with NATO allowing for NATO forces to conduct joint training exercises on Swedish soil and for NATO member states' forces to be deployed in Sweden in response to threats to Sweden's national security. In October 2014, an opinion poll found for the first time more Swedes in favor of NATO membership (37%) than opposed (36%). If the situation in and around the Baltic countries were to escalate, Swedish NATO membership, possibly together with Finland, would reduce barriers to NATO intervention in the region. NATO reported in 2015 that Russia simulated a nuclear attack on Sweden in 2013. The Swedish government questioned Sweden's neutral status after the Russian intervention in Ukraine. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov threatened in 2016 to \\"take necessary measures\\" to prevent Swedish NATO membership. According to a poll conducted by Sifo in June 2016, more Swedes are against a Swedish NATO membership than in favour of one. A government-sponsored report on the future of Sweden's NATO membership was released in September 2016. Ukraine At the beginning of 2008, the Ukrainian President, Prime Minister and head of parliament sent an official letter to apply for the Membership Action Plan. The idea of Ukrainian membership in NATO has gained support from a number of NATO leaders. At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer declared in a press conference that Georgia and Ukraine will join NATO. Within the NATO-Ukraine working commission, NATO officials reassured Ukraine officials that they are willing to invite their country to join the Alliance. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, Alexander Grushko, announced that NATO membership for Ukraine was not in Russia's best interests and wouldn't help the relations of the two countries. Anti-NATO signs in Feodosiya in 2006 According to numerous independent polls conducted between 2002 and the events of 2014, Ukrainian public opinion on NATO membership was split, with the majority of those polled against joining the military alliance and many identifying it as a threat.Razumkov Centre poll Retrieved on 26 August 2009 According to the FOM-Ukraine pollster, as of April 2009, 57% of Ukrainians polled were against joining the alliance, while 21% were in favor.FOM-Ukraine April 2009 survey, FOM-Ukraine Retrieved on 4 June 2009 A Gallup poll conducted in October 2008 showed that 45% associated NATO as a threat to their country, while only 15% associated it with protection.Ukrainians May Oppose President‚Äôs Pro-Western Goals Gallup Retrieved on 26 August 2009 Ukrainian politicians such as Yuriy Yekhanurov and Yulia Tymoshenko stated Ukraine would not join NATO as long as the public continued opposing the move. In 2008 the Ukrainian government started an information campaign, aimed at informing the Ukrainian people about the consequences of membership. The 2010 election returned Viktor Yanukovych as Ukrainian President and marked a turnaround in Ukraine's relations with NATO. In February 2010, he stated that Ukraine's relations with NATO were currently \\"well-defined\\", and that there was \\"no question of Ukraine joining NATO\\". He said the issue of Ukrainian membership of NATO might \\"emerge at some point, but we will not see it in the immediate future.\\"Yanukovych opens door to Russian navy keeping base in Ukraine GlobalSecurity.org Retrieved on 9 March 2010 While visiting Brussels in March 2010, he further stated that there would be no change to Ukraine's status as a member of the alliance's outreach program.Ukraine's Yanukovych: EU ties a 'key priority', Kyiv Post (1 March 2010) He later reiterated during a trip to Moscow that Ukraine would remain a \\"European, non-aligned state.\\"Ukraine vows new page in ties with Russia Retrieved on 9 March 2010 Then, on 3 June 2010 the Ukrainian parliament voted to exclude the goal of \\"integration into Euro-Atlantic security and NATO membership\\" from the country's national security strategy in a bill drafted by Yanukovych himself.Ukraine drops NATO membership bid, EUobserver (6 June 2010) Amid the Euromaidan unrest, Yanukovych fled Ukraine in February 2014.

Daalder together with James Goldgeier conceived the term \\"Global NATO\\". Subsequently, ideas for membership of various states were floated: Brazil, South Africa, Singapore, India, Israel, and most frequently of Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Colombia. The idea is to transform the Cold War institution into a \\"Global alliance of democracies\\". Australia The issue of Australian NATO membership is often brought forward. Australia is even referred to as a \\"de facto member of NATO\\". Australia is referred to by NATO as one of their \\"partners across the globe\\", agreeing to work on crisis and conflict management, post-conflict situations, reconstruction and facilitating humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. NATO and Australia signed a joint political declaration in June 2012 followed by a signature of an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme in February of the next year. General Knud Bartels, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee at the time, stressed the need for \\"substantial and practical cooperation, to learn from each other, share best practices and develop common standards because NATO and Australia have a strong partnership and are committed to enhancing their abilities of working together in order to better tackle future global challenges\\". Colombia Colombia is NATO's latest partner and Colombia has access to the full range of cooperative activities NATO offers to partners. NATO and Colombia have concluded a partnership agreement with a view to strengthening dialogue and cooperation to address shared security challenges. A close strategic ally and trade partner of NATO members the U.S. and Spain, Colombia has been a strong supporter of NATO and its actions. In 2009, the Colombian Government asked to be part of the ISAF and work with the Spanish contingent in mine detection operations, but this didn't materialize due to the internal conflict that Colombia faced. In March 2011, Colombia voted in favor of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, thus officially allowing for NATO military intervention in the Libyan Civil War. In April 2012, Colombia was amended into the NATO ATP-56(B) which gave Colombia \\"associate\\" status and to re-establish air-to-air fueling capabilities with NATO member countries. On 4 June 2013, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos announced that Colombia will be signing a Cooperation Agreement with NATO in hopes of eventually joining the military alliance. Santos also stated that: \\"If we can achieve peace, the army will be in a place where it will be able to distinguish itself internationally as well. We are already doing it on many fronts.\\" In response, the U.S. government noted, \\"Our goal is certainly to support Colombia as being a capable and strong member of lots of different international organizations, and that might well include NATO. Ultimately this is a decision that all of the NATO members would have to make.\\"U.S. might support Colombia NATO bid: State Department official Raw Story However, on the same day, a Colombian and NATO official both objected to NATO membership for Colombia. Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon stated his country merely wished to sign a cooperation deal with NATO, and a NATO official noted that, \\"There is no immediate plan for establishing a formal partnership between the alliance and Colombia, but we are exploring the possibility of carrying out specific activities together...and we are currently developing a security of information agreement which would allow the exchange of classified information between the alliance and Colombia.\\" India In September 2011, The NATO alliance invited India to be a partner in its ballistic missile defence (BMD). According to the reports a top NATO official stated addressing Indian representatives, \\"You have a missile threat that confronts you. We have a missile threat that confronts us. It's a different one, but our ability to defend against it could be the same. We have cooperation on those kind of issues. [..]Democracies face challenges that are common. We need to work together and resolve. We need to cooperate, because individually we cannot deal with such threats. It is better to deal with such issues commonly than deal with them individually\\" V. K Saraswat, the architect of Indian BMD program, subsequently informed, \\"We are analysing the report. It is under consideration.\\" Then-U.S. NATO Ambassador Ivo H. Daalder has suggested that India should turn away from its non-aligned role and join NATO. A Voice of Russia analysis quoted Robert Pshel, head of NATO's Information Office in Moscow as saying \\"I agree with Mr Daalder that many modern threats are global, and tackling them without emerging powers like India is hardly possible.\\" Daalder further stated, \\"The dialogue should be on how India's concept of its own security and of international security fits in with NATO's concept of international security and how NATO as an actor and India as a country can work together to promote security.\\" The United States and India have already studied the possibility of a joint missile defence system, although former Defence Secretary Robert Gates stated that \\"talks were only in their early stages.\\" Boris Volkonsky of the Russian Strategic Research Institute was quoted as saying, \\"an ally like India would strengthen Washington's hand in South and Southwest Asia and other world areas.\\" A Voice of Russia analysis speculated on an additional, ulterior motive from a shared Indian and American fear of the \\"rising dragon of China\\". And while most members of the Indian strategic community readily admit that NATO's Afghanistan mission coincides with India's own strategic interest in stabilising that country, they do not necessarily conclude from this that India and NATO should develop closer cooperation. It is believed that many Indian analysts harbour doubts about the possible implications for their country's international position should it develop closer ties with NATO. In a report published by NATO review it said, \\"The choice should be clear: exploiting NATO's potential as a forum for consultation and cooperation is a 'win-win' situation, both for India and for the Alliance.\\" Israel Japan Cooperation between Japan and NATO began in 1990, and Japan was one of the first \\"partners across the globe\\" when the relationship became more formalized. Japan deepened their relationship in April 2013 with a joint political declaration, and in May 2014 signed accords relating to counter- terrorism and counter-piracy efforts. Japan has also been involved in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and with stabilization efforts in the Balkans during the 1990s. South Korea Mongolia The NATO‚ÄìMongolia Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme was approved on 19 March 2012. It is the first application of the new policy for flexible partnerships with global partners. New Zealand In 2001, NATO and New Zealand signalled their commitment to strengthen cooperation with the joint signature of an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme in June 2012. New Zealand has made valuable contributions to NATO-led efforts in Afghanistan, first as part of the International Security Assistance Force and now under the new mission (known as \\"Resolute Support\\") to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces and institutions.

The homes were built between 1939 and 1940 by a cooperative of eight professors from the nearby University of Colorado, and designated as an historic district by the City of Boulder in 1978. Description The Floral Park Historic District was the first planned-unit development in Boulder County (1939) as well as the city's first historic district (1978). Floral Park was a forerunner of planned housing in the western United States and predates, by thirty years, other such developments in Colorado. The block is commonly referred to throughout Boulder as \\"Little Russia.\\" Designed by architect James M. Hunter, the eight homes occupy the single city block bounded by Mariposa, Bluebell, 15th and 16th Streets in Boulder. Hunter also designed a detailed landscaping plan for the entire block (including handball courts - which were never built). By design and agreement of the original cooperative members, the houses all incorporate a similar architectural design style (referred to as Monterey-Colonial), including painted-white brick, batten-board siding, green, white, or blue shutters and red tile roofs. The eight homes share a common eight-unit garage. (The original garage burned down and has since been replaced with a duplicate the original). History In the late 1930s, Henry Weihofen, a young professor at CU-Boulder, had become dissatisfied with available housing options for university faculty families. With the help of university regent, Valentine Fischer, Weihofen gathered a group of junior faculty together (all on low salaries) to develop a housing plan. The eight professors were: Henry Weihofen (law), James G. Allen (history), Francis (Frank) Geck (fine arts), Morris E. Garnsey (economics), Earl F. Swisher (Asian studies), Paul V. Thompson (English), Norman A. Parker (mechanical engineering), and Elbert W. Harrington (speech). Over a series of evening meetings, the eight faculty members and their wives decided to purchase Block 17 in the Floral Park area (just east of Chautauqua Park) with the intention of creating a \\"community housing project\\" for the enjoyment of their growing families. At the philosophical core of their housing plan was the creation of a shared open space. The city agreed to vacate the alleyway, leaving a large, undeveloped section of land running through the center of the block. The families designated this area - The Commons. The block has historically been known as Faculty Row (owing to the original owners' association with the university) or Red Square (owing to the red roofs, the square outline of the development) or Little Russia (owing to the project's communal/non-developer driven design and origins. ). At a meeting of the Boulder Landmarks Board on May 21, 1977, architect James M. Hunter noted that from its inception, many of Boulder's citizens associated \\"Communist overtones\\" with the Floral Park project.Minutes Boulder Landmarks Board November 1978 The group held a drawing to decide which lot went to which family. The eight houses, largely built using salvaged brick from Boulder's recently demolished State Preparatory School (built in 1895 and located at 17th and Pearl), were constructed around the perimeter of the Commons. A small Commons shelter house with flagstone patio and rustic stone fireplace were soon added. The block's property owners have agreed to preserve the open, park-like setting of the Commons and the architectural unity of the block. While the majority of the homes have incorporated modest additions and/or alterations over the years, the overall size and character of the District has been well maintained. The designation of the block as an historic district has further ensured the preservation of the area's unique character and historic importance. A commemorative plaque (installed on the front of the community garage by the City of Boulder) reads: \\"This block was designated as a planned unit 30 yrs. before similar developments in Boulder. Since 1939, when eight C.U. faculty families conceived the idea, the architecture and the environmental unity have been preserved through a gentlepersons' agreement.\\" - HD-77-1 In a letter written to the Landmarks Board in 1977, Morris E. Garnsey, one of the original homeowners stated that \\"I am certain that thirty-five years from now a third generation of owner-occupants will look back upon the origins of this area with gratitude and admiration.\\" (Minutes, Boulder Landmarks Board, November, 1978) Current homeowners are required to maintain the general appearance of the neighborhood, as defined in the District's published Guidelines and Covenants.Floral Park Historic District Design Guidelines and Covenants; File #2578108 on file at the Boulder Counter Clerk's Office. The blueprints for several of the residences, the landscaping plan for the Commons area, profiles of the original owners, and many other construction-related documents are housed at the Carnegie Branch (local history archive) of the Boulder Public Library. In 2013, the City of Boulder Historic Preservation Department created a Floral Park Historic District website. The site includes a detailed early history of the development, short biographies of the original homeowners, and historic and current photographs of the property and residences.

He was born John Purcell, the son of John Purcell, a Dublin physician and his wife Eleanor, the daughter of John Fitzgerald of Waterford. The Purcells were an Anglo-Irish family who had arrived in England at the time of the Norman conquest and settled in Ireland by 1172. John Purcell, junior was educated at Trinity College, Dublin (1790) and trained in the law at the Middle Temple (1792) and King's Inns (1793). He was called to the Irish bar in 1796, but never practised. He married in 1801 his cousin Mary Frances, the daughter and heiress of his uncle John Fitzgerald of Little Island, Waterford, who also had estates at Pendleton in Lancashire and Gayton, Staffordshire. The couple lived at the Bredfield House, also known as the White House, Bredfield, near Woodbridge, Suffolk and had three sons and five daughters. In 1810 Mary Frances, whose elder brother had died in 1807, inherited her great-aunt's estate, including the 3,000-acre manor of Naseby Wooleys, Northamptonshire. In 1823 he erected an obelisk to mark the site of the battle of Naseby. When she then inherited her father's estates in 1818, Purcell took the name of Fitzgerald. His wealthy wife spent much of her time circulating in London and Brighton society, travelling in a yellow carriage pulled by black horses, whilst Fitzgerald preferred the life of a Suffolk squire. He was appointed High Sheriff of Suffolk for 1824‚Äì25. The following year he leased Wherstead Lodge, near Ipswich and also bought property in Seaford, Sussex in order to stand for Parliament in 1826 as candidate for the Seaford constituency. He was duly elected, sitting until the constituency was abolished in the Great Reform Act of 1832. In the late 1820s he commissioned Robert Stephenson, (brother of George Stephenson), to commence coal-mining on his Lancashire estate, but fraud and flooding made the Pendleton Colliery venture unsuccessful and he was forced to file for bankruptcy. He and his wife were now formally separated and she left to live at Little Island, where she died in 1855. In 1835 he moved into Boulge Hall, near Woodbridge. His younger son Edward Fitzgerald, the poet and translator of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, lived in a cottage in the grounds. In 1838‚Äì39 he served as High Sheriff of County Waterford. On his death in 1852, his remaining estates were inherited by his eldest son John, a lay preacher, who took the name Purcell.

Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the roller coaster reaches a maximum height of and a maximum speed of . The coaster also features five inversions. Nitro opened to the public in October 2013. History As construction progressed with the theme park in early 2013, the owners of the park gave no details about the roller coaster other than that it would be the largest roller coaster in India. Even after the Roller Coaster Database reported that a Bolliger & Mabillard Floorless Coaster would be built at the park, the owners still released no details. In April 2013, the first pieces of the roller coaster were erected. By the end of August, all of the coaster's track was installed. Then in the third quarter of 2013, Adlabs Imagica released the details of Nitro. Nitro was originally scheduled to open in May 2013; however, it did not open until October. Ride experience Once the train is loaded and secured, the steel floor is retracted and the gate in front of the train opens. After being dispatched, the train immediately begins to climb the chain lift hill. At the top, the train drops down a small straight section before finishing the drop with a sharp turn to the right. When the train reaches the bottom of the drop, it reaches its maximum speed of and enters a vertical loop, followed by a dive loop. After making a slight turn to the right, the train makes a banked right turn through the loop it passes through before. Then, the train passes through a trim brake (to slow the train down) before entering a zero-gravity roll. The train then makes a banked turn to the left leading into the first of the interlocking corkscrews. After a banked turn to the right and a slight turn to the left, the train goes through the second corkscrew. The train then enters an approximate 180-degree downward banked turn to the left before making a final right turn into the brake run which leads directly back to the station. When the train arrives back to the station, the floors come back up, with the front gate closes, and the next riders board. One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Characteristics Track Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, the steel track of Nitro is approximately long, and the height of the lift is high. The roller coaster also features five inversions. The track is painted red with yellow rails and blue supports. Trains Nitro operates with two steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides in a single row, for a total of 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over the shoulder restraint. The structure of the trains are coloured blue, red, and yellow; the seats are black and the restraints are yellow. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Nitro does not have a floor on its trains. With the trains reaching a top speed of , Nitro is the second fastest Bolliger & Mabillard Floorless Coaster. Reception Neha Borkar from the Indiatimes said, \\"[The roller coaster] almost kills you, because it twirls, twists, and turns at a rapid speed, which reminds you of speed from the movies like 'Final Destination' and 'The Fast and the Furious'.

(2001 onwards), \\"Asparagales: Scilloideae\\", Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, retrieved 2014-02-25 It is distributed in southern Africa (the Cape Province of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana). Description Pseudogaltonia grows from a large bulb with a fibrous tunic. The flowers are borne on a long stem (scape) in a pyramid-shaped raceme. Individual flowers are borne on long stalks (pedicels) and droop downwards. The tepals are fused at the base, forming a tube about two-thirds or three- quarters of the length of the flower, swollen slightly at its base. The tubular part of the tepals is green, the free lobes are whitish with a green streak. The stamens, which protrude from the flower, have broad triangle- shaped filaments which are arise from the mouth of the flower tube and green anthers. The seeds are black. Systematics The name Pseudogaltonia was first used by Otto Kuntze in 1886 as the name of a section within the genus Hyacinthus. He also suggested that those who preferred smaller genera could use it as the name of a separate genus. In 1888, Adolf Engler used Kuntze's Pseudogaltonia as a genus name in his treatment of the Liliaceae. Kuntze had named the only species known at that time as Hyacinthus pechuelii, which Engler transferred to Pseudogaltonia pechuelii. However, the species had already been described with the name Galtonia clavata in 1884, giving the epithet \\"clavata\\" priority over \\"pechuelii.\\" A second species of Pseudogaltonia, P. liliiflora, was named in 2009. The genus is placed in the tribe Ornithogaleae (or the subfamily Ornithogaloideae by those who use the family Hyacinthaceae). Within this tribe, molecular phylogenetic studies place it as most closely related to the genus Dipcadi.

Background  Lil Bub was the runt of her litter born to a feral mother. She was born with several genetic mutations, had to be bottle-fed, and had difficulty being adopted. Lil Bub had an extreme form of feline dwarfism that caused her limbs and lower jaw to be quite small in comparison to the rest of her body. The shortened lower jaw meant that, among other things, she could not retain her tongue within her mouth. Her owner, Mike Bridavsky, adopted her when his friends asked him to give her a home. When Bridavsky first picked her up, he said \\"Hey, Bub!\\" Lil Bub suffered from osteopetrosis for which she received medication. In late 2012, during the filming of Lil Bub & Friendz, she had a serious health episode and was diagnosed with osteopetrosis by a specialist in Indianapolis.Lil Bub & Friendz Lil Bub's short legs and osteopetrosis restricted her movement but she was termed \\"a fantastic waddler.\\" Vibrations from travel also break down the osteoclasts.

The purpose of this project was to better understand Lil Bub's unique appearance (for example, her extra digits). The campaign reached its funding goal on May 25, 2015. The scientists found Lil Bub had a mutation in gene RANK/TNFRSF11A which has also been found in one mouse and fifteen humans. Their research on Lil Bub is published at bioRxiv.

She is the first openly transgender professor at an Orthodox Jewish institution.  Early life, education, and identity  Ladin has described intuiting her girlhood at a young age, viewing her assigned male identity as \\"false\\" as a child. At age eight, she began calling herself a \\"pacifist\\" in order to avoid combative play and athletics. She received her Ph.D. from Princeton University in 2000, her MFA in Creative Writing from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1995 and her B.A. from Sarah Lawrence College in 1982. In 2007, Ladin received tenure at Yeshiva University, and thereafter announced her gender transition. In response, she was placed on paid leave for 18 months. With the aid of lawyers from Lambda Legal, Ladin returned to work at Yeshiva University in 2008.  Poetry  As of 2018, Ladin has published nine books of poetry. (Some of these works appear under her previous name.) * The Future is Trying to Tell Us Something. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2017.) * Fireworks in the Graveyard. (Headmistress Press, 2017) * Impersonation. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2015.) * The Definition of Joy. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2012.) * Psalms (Wipf & Stock, 2010) * Coming To Life. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2010.) * Transmigrations. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2009.) * The Book of Anna. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2007.) * Alternatives to History. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2003.) In 2013, Ladin published a series of poems formed entirely from words and phrases found in popular women's magazines. These poems, such as \\"Ready To Know,\\" link both trans women and cis women's experiences of gender to the \\"commodity capitalist engine of the production of femininity.\\" This work emerged when Ladin gave herself a \\"writing assignment\\" to creatively engage with the \\"how-to\\" rhetoric of mainstream femininity. In 2016, Ladin won a $25,000 creative writing grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.  Memoir  In 2012, she published the memoir Through the Door of Life: A Jewish Journey Between Genders.[13] In the book, she asserts that she is \\"old-fashioned ‚Äì a garden-variety transsexual, rather than a post-modernist shape-shifter,‚Äù a claim which led critics to contrast her memoir with Kate Bornstein's. Her memoir describes her family life, her transition, and her religious faith, including her perception that her \\"gender identity crisis had destroyed [her] marriage.\\" In 2012, Through the Door of Life was a finalist in the \\"Biography, Autobiography, Memoir\\" category of the National Jewish Book Awards.  Scholarship  Alongside her creative output, Ladin has frequently commented on the fields of trans literature and poetics. Ladin takes a non-identitarian stance, in that she does not believe that trans literature is necessarily being about trans experiences, or written by trans people. In her \\"Trans Poetics Manifesto,\\" Ladin defines trans poetics as \\"techniques that enable poetic language to reflect the kind of complex, unstable, contradictory relations between body and soul, social self and psyche, that those who see ourselves as transgender experience as acute, definitive, life-changing.\\" Ladin has argued that poetry, and lyric forms in particular, might be the best mode through which to represent the transgender experience. In 2018, Ladin published her first full- length academic monograph, The Soul of the Stranger: Reading God and Torah from a Transgender Perspective (Brandeis University Press). Her book offers trans readings of the Torah in order to argue that, despite traditional readings of Genesis and other biblical stories as enforcing a strict dichotomy between men and women, ‚ÄúGod is not particularly invested in gender‚Äù or the gender binary per se. Ladin's exegesis instead positions Jewish religious patriarchy as a function of social norms, not the sacred texts themselves. In a divergence from traditional scholarly reading methods, The Soul of Stranger includes autobiographical reflection as well as close readings. Personal life Ladin has three children from her previous marriage to the writer Christine Benvenuto. She is now remarried.

Made between 1760 and 1780 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, its design was inspired by British furniture-maker Thomas Chippendale. Description Chippendale's rococo style is readily visible in this high chest, with its scroll pediment, flame finials, and shell motifs on the drawers. It is carved from Virginia walnut, with brass mounts. An unusual feature is the unbroken top row of narrow drawers, with the elaborate shell-carved drawer above, rather than centered in the row. This is a more constrained and conservative stylistic choice than many other high chests, hinting at an earlier dating within the period. Historical information In 1754, Chippendale published his hugely influential book of furniture patterns, The Gentleman and Cabinet- Maker's Director. While quite popular on both sides of the Atlantic, the tensions in the years around the Revolutionary War forced Americans to buy locally. Philadelphia was the largest city in the colonies, and growing rapidly larger thanks to a population boom. Thus, its furniture makers were kept busy crafting pieces such as this, adapting the Chippendale styles demanded by cosmopolitan customers to American tastes and materials. High chests were particularly popular items, used to store clothing and table linens. Acquisition The high chest of drawers was a gift of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Indiana to the IMA in 1975. It has the accession number 75.99 and is currently on view in the William L. Fortune Gallery. References External links *IMA page.

Her name was spelled in various ways including Pewet, Pewit and Pewitt and would appear to be a reference to the northern lapwing. In a racing career which lasted from May 1789 and May 1792 she won four of her thirteen races. In the St Leger she finished second to a colt named Zanga, but was awarded the race when the winner was disqualified for causing interference. After her retirement from racing she became a successful broodmare whose descendants won many important races throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Background Pewett was a bay mare bred by her owner William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam. She was the third of eleven foals produced by Termagant, a mare bred by Lord Rockingham. Her sire Tandem was prevented from racing by injury but proved a reasonably successful stallion when based at Richard Tattersall's stud at Highflyer Hall. Apart from Pewett, his most notable offspring was The Yellow Filly, winner of the Oaks Stakes in 1786. Racing career 1789: three- year-old season \\"Pewet\\" made her racecourse debut on 5 May at Malton when she started favourite for a sweepstakes over one and a half miles and won from the colts Bolus and Telescope. The filly did not reappear until 22 September when she was one of six three-year-olds to contest the St Leger over two miles at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by William Wilson she finished second to the Duke of Hamilton's black colt by Laurel (later named Zanga), but was awarded the victory when the judge's decided that the colt's jockey had been guilty of \\"jostling\\". On her only other start of the season she returned to Malton on 13 October and finished second to Lord Archibald Hamilton's bay colt by Highflyer (later named Walnut). 1790: four-year-old season In 1790, Pewett again began her season at Malton in May, when she started favourite for a four-mile sweepstakes and won from five opponents. Six days later at York she finished second Lord Archibald Hamilton's five-year-old horse Scorpion in a race over two miles. At the next York meeting in August she met Walnut for the second time in a four-mile subscription race and again finished runner-up to the colt. In September the filly ran at Lincoln Racecourse in a King's Plate for fillies and mares run in a series of two-mile heats, with the prize going to the first horse to win twice. She finished third in the first heat and second in the next two as the event was won by Sir F. Poole's Jemima. Later that month she returned to the scene of her classic success when she ran a match race over two miles against Bywell. Pewett was opposed in the betting but won the match to claim a prize of 200 guineas. 1791: five-year-old season Pewett won one of her four races in 1791. She did not compete until 7 September when she was beaten by Mr Garforth's mare Camilla in a King's Plate at Richmond. A week later at Wakefield racecourse she ran in a ¬£50 race over four miles: she finished fourth in the first heat but won the next two to record her final victory. At Doncaster at the end of the month she finished sixth of the seven runners behind Young Traveller in the Doncaster Cup and last of three behind Walnut in the Doncaster Stakes later the same afternoon. 1792: six-year-old season Pewett made one appearance as a six-year-old, finishing last in a sweepstakes over two miles at York on 21 May. Stud career Pewett was retired to become a broodmare for Lord Fitzwilliam and produced nine foals: * 1794, bay filly sired by Phoenomenon * 1796, bay filly by King Fergus * 1797, Lapwing, bay filly by Overton * 1798, bay filly by Standard * 1799, Woodpecker, bay colt by Buzzard * 1802, Sir Paul, bay colt by Sir Peter Teazle, third in the 1805 St Leger * 1803, brown filly by Stamford * 1804, Paulina, bay filly by Sir Peter Teazle, won the 1807 St Leger * 1812, Clinkerina, brown filly by Clinker Paulina was Pewett's most successful racehorse and became an influential broodmare, being regarded as Foundation mare of Thoroughbred family 8-e. Her descendants included the classic winning colts Andover and Sir Tatton Sykes. Pewett's last foal Clinkerina also became a successful and influential broodmares. Her son Humphrey Clinker sired the St Leger winner Rockingham and Melbourne, sire of the Triple Crown winner West Australian. Her more distant descendants included Exhibitionnist, Youth and Eishin Flash.

The result of a merger with a similar publication, RBCC's purpose was to bring fans together for the purpose of adding to their comic book collections. It also proved to be a launching pad for aspiring comic book creators, many of whom corresponded and exchanged their work through RBCC, and published work in the fanzine as amateurs. RBCC featured fan-generated art, original articles, and advertisements from comic book fans and dealers. Debuting in the pre-direct market era (before the proliferation of comics retailers), RBCC was one of the first and largest forums for buying and selling comics through the mail ‚Äî often, the only way for fans to acquire back issues was through advertisements in RBCC. And, as ComicSource wrote, \\"RBCC was also an educational forum, with rich articles devoted to comics and creators long absent from the newsstands, such as EC Comics.\\"\\"RBCC Founder G.B. Love Dies: Was Early Fandom Pioneer,\\" ComicSource Newsletter #18 (2001). Accessed Apr. 10, 2013.  History   Origins and merger  Inspired in part by the science-fiction fanzine/\\"adzine\\" The Fantasy Collector, in 1961, Jerry Bails, \\"the father of comics fandom,\\" created The Comicollector as \\"a publication devoted primarily to the field\\" rather than the occasional advertisements of comics for sale that appeared in The Fantasy Collector.Bill Schelly, \\"Jerry Bails' Ten Building Blocks of Fandom,\\" Alter Ego vol. 3, #25 (June 2003), pp. 5. After publishing The Comicollector for a year, Bails passed it on to Ronn Foss. Meanwhile, Miami-based comics and science fiction enthusiast G. B. Love had formed the Science Fiction and Comics Association (S.F.C.A.) and begun publishing his own fanzine, The Rocket's Blast (also debuting in 1961). In 1964 The Comicollector and The Rocket's Blast merged to form The Rocket's Blast and the Comicollector. The first issue of the new publication was #29 (continuing the numbering of The Rocket's Blast) and dated April 1964. (By about issue #50 [1966], the fanzine had shortened its title to Rocket's Blast Comicollector, and often just referred to itself as RBCC.)  Love era  Cartoonist Grass Green was an early and frequent contributor to RBCC, as was Buddy Saunders (later proprietor of the Lone Star Comics chain of comic book retailers), and Raymond L. Miller. Contributing writers during this era included science fiction author Howard Waldrop. Between issues #25 (published Dec. 1963) and #50 (1966), the zine's circulation grew from about 200 to over 1,100. By RBCC #75 (1968), the circulation was 2,000. With issue RBCC #100 (1973), the circulation hit 2,250. Between 1968 and 1973, comics artist Don Newton produced almost two dozen covers for the Rocket's Blast Comicollector. Newton's science fiction strip The Savage Earth ran from 1968 to 1970 in RBCC. Joe Kubert serialized his strip \\"Danny Dreams\\" in the pages of RBCC in 1971. From 1972‚Äì1975 comics historian James Van Hise serialized his (and Larry Bigman's) \\"Al Williamson Collector\\" in the pages of RBCC.See Van Hise, James, The Al Williamson Collector, Rocket's Blast Comicollector, Miami: S.F.C.A, #'s 90‚Äì116. In the early 1970s, RBCC joined the WE Seal of approval program, a consumer protection/anti-mail fraud program. Love published RBCC until 1974, when he moved from Miami to Houston, Texas, where he became involved with Star Trek fandom (and co-produced Houstoncon '74 and '75).  Van Hise era  With Love's departure (issue #113, published in Sept. 1974), long-time contributor James Van Hise took over the publishing duties of Rocket's Blast Comicollector. Van Hise introduced new features and columns to the zine, freshening its aesthetic for new audiences.Fratz, Doug. \\"TNJ Listings,\\" The New Nostalgia Journal #28 (Aug. 1976), p. 39. Van Hise published four issues of RBCC under the auspices of the Science Fiction Comics Association in 1976‚Äì1977. From 1976‚Äì1978, cartoonist Don Rosa serialized his adventure comic strip The Pertwillaby Papers in RBCC. With the rise of the direct market system in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Rocket's Blast Comicollector was forced to shift its focus, as its readers could more easily find comics back issues in local comic shops rather than buying them through the mail. Competition from the likes of Comics Buyer's Guide pressured RBCC as well; after publishing on a monthly schedule for most of its existence, in 1978 RBCC went bimonthly. RRBC published four issues in 1979 (when their circulation hit a peak of 3,300), one issue in 1980, no issues in 1981, two issues in 1982, and its final issue, #153, in 1983. The last few issues were published by New Media Publications, which also published the fanzines Comics Feature and LOC (and published many works by editor Van Hise). RBCC's final issue was a parody issue titled \\"The Contentious Journal,\\" which appeared to be satirizing one of its competitors, The Comics Journal.  2002‚Äì2003 revival  In 2002‚Äì2003, James Van Hise temporarily revived The Rocket's Blast and the Comicollector, publishing four issues out of a new headquarters in Yucca Valley, California.Kreiner, Rich. \\"Meet the Comics Press: Rocket from the Crypt,\\" The Comics Journal #249 (Dec. 2002), pp. 54‚Äì55.  Format  Starting out as a photocopied fanzine, RBCC eventually morphed into a magazine-size publication.

Biography Achgelis was born in Golzwarden in Oldenburg, and after an apprenticeship as an electrician, began working as a stunt pilot in 1928. In 1930 he flew inverted for an hour over London, and in 1931 he was the German aerobatic champion. Flying a Fw 44 Stieglitz, Achgelis was placed third in the 1934 World Aerobatic Championships in Paris, and was 5th at the 1936 event in Berlin. From April 1932, he also worked as a flying instructor at the Technikum Weimar, and in 1933 became chief test pilot for the Focke-Wulf company in Bremen. On 26 June 1936 he flew the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, considered the first practical helicopter, on its maiden flight. On 27 April 1937, together with Henrich Focke, he founded the company Focke-Achgelis to develop and manufacture helicopters at Hoykenkamp. In 1933 Hermann G√∂ring proposed that Achgelis take a post as an instructor at the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (\\"German Air Transport School\\"), to establish and train an aerobatic team. Achgelis turned down the offer, and he also refused G√∂ring's request to take the position of Generalluftzeugmeister (\\"Luftwaffe Director-General of Equipment\\") after the death of Ernst Udet in November 1941. He worked as a test pilot at an aircraft factory in Graudenz until the end of World War II. After the war, Achgelis retired to his family farm, and from 1952 had commercial interests in Hude. However he remained connected to flying. In 1961, he was one of the founders of the airfield Flugplatz Oldenburg-Hatten at Hatten, and in 1975, he received the l√©gion d'honneur from France for his achievements in aviation. He also donated the Kavalier der L√ºfte trophy, which is presented annually every November. Achgelis died at his home in Hude in 1991.

Sunday 21 March 2013. Retrieved on 9 April 2013. Content The film covers the Jewish involvement in Egyptian business and arts in the first half of the 20th Century. It then mentions the founding of Israel in 1948, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and the Suez Crisis in 1956. Due to the crisis, the Jews of Egypt were forced into exile. People giving testimonials in the film include exiled Egyptian Jews, most of whom lived in Paris; Mohamed Abu El- Ghar, the author of Jews of Egypt: From Prosperity to Diaspora; a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who had participated in an attack of Jewish shops in Egypt in 1947; and Essam Fawzi, a sociologist. Production Director Amir Ramses said that he had considered making the film for several years. Ramses and producer Haitham Al-Khamissi self-funded the film, believing that relying on a sponsor, whether the sponsor was Arab or not, would hamper the neutrality of the film. Ramses took a six month trip to prepare for making the film. Ramses began conducting research in late 2008. Research consisted of locating and interviewing Jews within Egypt, building a \\"historical skeleton,\\" and then obtaining print media, videos, and other archival material. Film shooting began in 2009. The 2011 Egyptian revolution caused work on the film to be suspended. In the meantime the director and his group took a trip to Morocco. Work on the film was made for one additional year until the September 2012 completion. Release The avant-premi√®re occurred in October 2012 during the Panorama of the European Film. Amir Ramses said that the premiere took place in a \\"blatantly intellectual context.\\" It was screened at the northern hemisphere winter 2012 Arab Camera Festival in Rotterdam and the January 2013 Palm Springs International Film Festival. In the first week of March 2013 the film was scheduled for screening in theatres in Cairo. On Wednesday March 13, 2013, producer Haitham El-Khameesy said that the Censorship Bureau officials did not issue a permit for a release of his film in Egyptian cinemas and that they requested to view the film before they could allow its screening. Reuters said that security source told them that the permit had been granted and that it had not prevented its screening.\\"Egypt Won't Permit Film on Egyptian Jews.\\" () Reuters at Voice of America. 13 March 2013.

Paddle8's sales focus on pieces priced between $1,000 and $100,000, all vetted by specialists for authenticity. Paddle8 has offices in New York, Los Angeles, London and Hong Kong. In 2016, Paddle8 merged with the Berlin online auction house Auctionata. In February 2017, Auctionata declared insolvency and Paddle8 became an independent company once again, before selling to Native in 2018, and then to Facebank AG in 2019. In March 2020, Paddle8 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York just one week after the non-profit New American Cinema Group filed a lawsuit against the company for allegedly misappropriating funds from a charity auction.  History  Paddle8 was founded in May 2011 by Alexander Gilkes (a former LVMH executive and the chief auctioneer at Phillips auction house), Aditya Julka (an entrepreneur and Harvard Business School Baker Scholar), and Osman Khan (a banker with experience at Goldman Sachs and Perella Weinberg Partners and a Harvard Business School MBA). Initially created as a broad platform for presenting exhibitions of contemporary art online, Paddle8 refined its business model to focus solely on auctions. Paddle8 connects buyers and sellers of fine art, collectibles, design, jewelry, and watches through an online auction platform and an iPhone app. In 2014, Paddle8 sold more than $35.8 million worth of art, a 146% gain over the previous year. Since its founding, Paddle8 has also partnered with over 300 non-profit organizations worldwide, from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Guggenheim, to present their benefit auctions online, dramatically expanding their audience of supporters by tapping into Paddle8's community of 500,000 collectors. By January 2015, Paddle8 had presented more than 500 benefit auctions, with over $500m in bids. In 2012, Paddle8 acquired online auction platform Blacklots. In May 2013, Paddle8 acquired an option to purchase a stake in Artnet. In December 2017 P8H Inc, the New York legal entity that owns and operates Paddle8, had been taken over by a syndicate of Swiss investors that installed Izabela Depczyk as the interim CEO and the change manager at Paddle8 with the mandate to introduce and execute on the new business strategy for Paddle8. In the first 10 months of 2018, Paddle8 realized a 21 percent growth compared to 2017., and by the summer 2019 under Ms. Depczyk‚Äôs leadership Paddle8 has ventured into new business areas, like gaming, and the company has joined forces with the new- media platform Highsnobiety for online sales of curated street art, artist‚Äôs collectibles, and street wear. In August 2019 Pulse Evolution Group Inc, the US-listed company, acquired Facebank AG of Switzerland , subsequently renaming itself into Facebank Group Inc and becoming the largest shareholder of P8H Inc (Paddle8) through its holding of Facebank AG. In November P8H Inc appointed the new CEO Valentine Uhovski . In March 2020, the board of Paddle8 filed for Chapter 11 in the Southern District of New York, on the heels of a recent lawsuit demanding payment for works of art sold at a charitable auction last November.  Funding  By October 2015, Paddle8 had raised $44 million from leaders from across the art, luxury, media, and tech industries. Paddle8's $4-million Series A round was led by Founder Collective and Mousse Partners. In June 2013, Paddle8 announced $6 million in funding from new investors, including artist Damien Hirst, Alexander von F√ºrstenberg, Russian mogul Vladimir Yevtushenkov, Matthew Mellon, and Jay Jopling, owner of White Cube. In October 2015, Paddle8 announced $34 million in Series C funding. New investors represented an array of notable figures from the worlds of technology, art and luxury, including newest Paddle8 board member David Zwirner, one of the most influential international art dealers; German collector and investor Rolf Sachs; Eric Fellner, co-chairman of Working Title Films; and Edgar Berger, Chairman and CEO International of Sony Music Entertainment. The round also saw participation from existing investors including Mousse Partners, Damien Hirst, Jay Jopling of White Cube Gallery; and Stavros Niarchos, a collector and entrepreneur.  Benefit auctions  Paddle8 also partners with non-profit institutions to host their benefit auctions online, opening up their fundraising prospects to Paddle8's global community of collectors. As of January 2015, Paddle8 had raised more than $33 million for non-profit organizations around the world.  Merger with Auctionata  In May 2016, Paddle8 and Berlin-based online auction platform Auctionata announced that they would merge, creating a company with more specialties and broader international reach. In September 2016 the joint company announced the appointment of a new CEO, Thomas Hesse. In February 2017, Auctionata declared insolvency and Paddle8 became an independent company once again, backed by private equity from a multi-family office called Lightyear Collective, which was incorporated in Delaware only in January 2017 and its members were not disclosed, but are known to include Christopher Hsu, the hedge fund manager who runs the Hong Kong-based Kilometre Capital Management. At the same time, Patrick van der Vorst bought back ValueMyStuff out of the insolvency.

Players include Joe Duckworth, Herbert Simpson, Jack Robinson, James Mullineux (standing, from left), Bob McKay, Hugh McPhee (seated, from left), and Slotch Shaw (on floor, right). Lincoln City Football Club, an English association football club based in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, was founded in 1884, and first entered the FA Cup in the 1884‚Äì85 season. When nationally organised league football in England began, the club joined the Combination, a league set up to provide organised football for those clubs not invited to join the Football League which was to start the same year. When that league folded, Lincoln became founder members of the Midland League, and won the inaugural league title. They then spent a year in the Football Alliance before being elected to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. Lincoln moved in and out of the Football League until they became founder members of the Football League Third Division North in 1921. They remained in the Football League until 1987, when they became the first club to suffer automatic relegation to the Conference National. They returned to the League after just one season, remained at that level until relegated again in 2011, and returned once more in 2017. All players who have made between 25 and 99 appearances in senior first-team matches for Lincoln City, in league or cup competition, are listed below. Some hold club records: Allan Hall scored 41 goals in the 40-game league season as Lincoln won the 1931‚Äì32 Third Division North title, and Jimmy Bauchop was the oldest known player to score for the club, at 37 years 295 days. The club made their record signing when they paid ¬£75,000 to Carlisle United for Dean Walling in 1997. Other players took part in significant matches in the history of the club. William and James Gresham, Ned Mettam, Isaac Moore and Slotch Shaw appeared in Lincoln's first Football League match in 1892. Con Moulson, Keith Alexander and Phil Stant went on to manage the team. Harry Pugh was the first man in this appearance range to have been capped by his country while a Lincoln City player, when he represented Wales against Scotland in 1900. Eight other men have played senior international football for their country while a Lincoln player, most recently Arnaud Mendy, who played for Guinea-Bissau in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in 2014. Delroy Facey of Grenada and Gareth McAuley (Northern Ireland) are the club's most capped players, each having played five times for their country while registered with Lincoln. As of the date below, five men have ended their Lincoln careers on 99 competitive appearances; the most recent, midfielder Dany N'Guessan, was with the club from 2007 to 2009.

The show is a collaboration between companies Nelvana Limited, Playmates Toys, and The Topps Company. The show was created by Sean Jara, who is also the executive story editor and producer. It was originally aimed at boys but switched its focus to girls aged 6 to 11 during the development process. Nelvana's Andrew Kerr explained in 2016 that the show's developers agreed that \\"at this moment in time the project would be better served if we had female protagonists.\\" In August 2018, Jara confirmed on Twitter that Mysticons was not renewed for any episodes beyond its initial 40-episode production order. The final episode of the series, \\"Age of Dragons\\", aired on September 15, 2018 in the United States and September 23, 2018 in Canada. An ongoing series of comic books (graphic novels) and chapter books (original adventures) was first released on August 28, 2018.https://www.amazon.com/Mysticons-1-Kate-Leth/dp/1506706479 Volume 2 was released on May 21, 2019, and Volume 3 followed in late 2019. The chapter books depict dozens of original adventures that never occurred in the animated series; each featuring each Mysticon as the central character; each set within a particular season of the television show. Synopsis Season One In the mystical world of Gemina, in a place called Drake City, four teenage girls are chosen by the all-powerful Dragon Disk to become legendary heroes known as the Mysticons. Arkayna, Emerald, Zarya and Piper undertake an arduous quest to find four spellbooks and animal-themed bracers of mystical power to form the Codex. This will grant them their full strength and abilities necessary to save their world from Dreadbane, who seeks to release Necrafa, the leader of the Spectral Hand and Queen of the Undead. When Necrafa is freed she betrays Dreadbane and throws him into where she was once banished by Imani Firewing. While fulfilling various quests to bring harmony and order to the realm, the Mysticons encounter several trusty allies and devious adversaries. A startling revelation is that Princess Arkayna has had a fraternal twin sister. Unfortunately, a prophecy foretelling inevitable annihilation, prevented them from growing up together. :When the twin stars unite :The spectral beast will take flight :Its roars will herald a new dark age :And the realm will be purged :By the Dragon's rage Nova Terron had been ordered to send the younger princess twin to an alternate dimension on the astral plane. Unable to bring himself to do so, he sent her to a fairy orphanage hidden from mortal eyes. The Mysticons succeed in finding a blue-green birth gem in the vault of the Dragon, which is revealed to belong to the mysterious and immensely powerful Astromancer Proxima Starfall, who had stayed at the orphanage until taken in by the Astromancers at a young age. It is later revealed that Princess Arkayna's real fraternal twin sister is none other than the sarcastic Zarya Moonwolf. Proxima's blue-green birth gem had been purposefully switched with Zarya's as a cover-up to protect her true identity, making Proxima's family history nothing more than a complete fabrication. Having had a vision, the long-lost Princess Twins of Gemina head to Mount Tryanus to obtain two yellow rings, which transform them into \\"the Twin Dragon\\", enabling them to obliterate both the Spectral Dragon and the Queen of the Undead in one single strike; an act that leaves half of her mysterious mask behind. Season Two Princess Arkayna, Zarya, Emerald and Piper are enjoying their lives. However, they are needed once again to destroy a surviving fragment of Necrafa's mask by tossing it into the fiery core of the Rift of Ruin, a volcanic trench in the depths of the sea. Proxima accompanies them as an Astromancer, but is secretly lonely and bitter; she deceives them into believing that she had destroyed the mask fragment while keeping it to seek vengeance against those who had deceived her about her family history, mistrusted her judgement and underestimated her powerful magical abilities. Meanwhile, Nova Terron and the other Astromancers enlist Malvaron, Doug, and Choko on a special mission to get Tazma out of Necrafa's old lair before they destroy it. To save Tazma they use a shrinking potion and imprison her in a snow-globe which she escapes twice. Though Necrafa's lair and Necrafa herself are destroyed, Tazma still uses the dark magic and knowledge from both in later episodes while reminiscing from time to time. After the lair's destruction it is never seen again so, the, turned evil, Proxima uses Astromancer Academy for her headquarters on her path of vengeance. Proxima turns her former master, Nova Terron, and fellow top-level Astromancers into her mindless, masked minions: Spectromancers. She snatches the Dragon Disk and fully corrupts the ancient and all-powerful artifact with evil magic. After succeeding in creating her very own Dark Codex, she calls upon four female warriors called the Vexicons, from its dark and sinister pages to combat the Mysticons. This leaves her free to achieve the necessary steps for her ultimate revenge on Arkayna, for making her believe that she had a family and was loved in the realm, and for Zarya getting everything she would have had. Things have escalated further, as Proxima has now been fully possessed by the evil within the half Necrafa's mask; having worn it for so long it had caused its intense dark power to become deeply attached to Proxima and chose her as its rightful host. To help remove the mask off of Proxima who is out cold before the Vexicons arrive at the Stronghold to take the half of the mask, Tazma tells Arkayna a spell that traps the Mysticons inside Proxima's subconscious mind, in which they see Proxima's memories and learn of her troubled and lonely childhood since leaving Mrs. Sparklebottom's sanctuary, to the point of choosing the dark powers of the mask fragment because of an oblivious Princess Arkayna never being truly there for her as a sister and for breaking her heart so badly. After freeing Proxima of the stronger hold the mask's fragment has had on her, Arkayna apologizes for her oblivious actions toward Proxima and welcomes her back as her triplet \\"twin sister\\". Proxima explains all she had learned while under the evil influence of the mask; how the Spectral Hand itself has tempted and manipulated many over the millennia; such as Necrafa (who was, in fact, a powerful elven sorceress), Captain Kaos, and finally Mallory. With the piece of the mask having taken over her as it did Proxima, Mallory takes charge and has her three Vexicon sisters help her in releasing the ravenous wrath of the Spectral Hand's beast upon Drake City. Proxima reverses the dark spell on the mindless Spectromancers, turning them all back into top Astromancers- Nova Terron, Gandobi and Quasarla- who fend off the tentacles of the ancient ruins, from which the Spectral Hand is imprisoned. Out of options, the Mysticons turn to Dreadbane as he is the only one who can return Queen Goodfey and King Darius to life. He initially refuses but comes to his senses when he saved a human boy who reminds him of what he was. He rises to the occasion as an unexpected ally and prevents the bone statues of the queen and king from being destroyed. However, he is gravely wounded when taking a fatal blow for Arkayna, from Mallory's greater snowy blast. He uses the last of his strength, before turning into stardust, to undo the spell he himself had cast to fully restore Princess Arkayna and Zarya's mother and stepfather to living flesh and blood, after being frozen in time for so many months. Arkayna reunites with her mother, and introduces her to Zarya Moonwolf who addresses her as \\"Mom\\", to the Queen's confusion. Her brief memories of the newborn Zarya are returned to her by Nova Terron (off-screen) and she provides the blueprints for the four mystical Lances of Justice which were hidden in her necklace for safekeeping. She accompanies her twin daughters (riding Zarya on Archer, much to Arkayna's resentment and envy), Emerald and Piper on their ultimate quest to stop to Vexicons and finally eradicate the Spectral Hand. Zarya finally comes to the realization that the Spectral Hand does have a great weakness: the Dragons of Light. They all go to the sacred realm of Dragonhenge and see King Valmuk and his baby daughter Stormy again. They see the hidden, remaining yellow dragon eggs. King Valmuk explains that by only being given a boost from the ancient time magic of the Ever Realm can dragons be strong enough by reaching full adulthood more quickly. This plan works but, the Vexicons trap the Mysticons before they can strike the demon of the Spectral Hand. Em & the others beg for the help of Eartha, who they saved from crumbling in the episode, \\"Heart Of Stone.\\" Eartha frees the Mysticons before the other Vexicons banish the girls and she destroys Mallory's ice-white hair, subjecting the ice witch to ultimate humiliation. The Mysticons ride their newly adult dragon mounts to the Spectral Hand demon and use their enhanced bracers, powered by the mystical Lances of Justice, to strike the Spectral Hand demon thus, sending it into oblivion and returning peace to the land forever. Some loose ends are also tied up such as, the Vexicons are imprisoned (possibly in the Necrafa prison dimension). Eartha remains unpunished for helping the Mysticons restore peace to all of Gemina. Nova Terron steps down as leader of the Astromancers and announces Proxima, his second-in-command, as the new leader/Star Mistress of the Academy, as he leaves on adventures across the astral plane with his lifelong girlfriend/starmate Geraldine Yaga. The Mask's remains are thrown into the Rift of Ruin and are forever destroyed by Zarya. Even though peace and order have been restored to the realm of Gemina, the second generation of Mysticons continue their never-ending adventures in defending all from threats; namely Tazma and Kymraw. Characters Mysticons The Mysticons are four teenage girls whose destiny it is to use unique mystical powers and weaponry to defend the world of Gemina and its inhabitants from evil forces, namely the Spectral Hand. A generation of Mysticons is chosen once every thousand years by the ancient and powerful Dragon Disk. Their unique Mysticon abilities and weaponry become a hundred times greater and more effective when the Codex is combined into one larger spellbook, which happened to have been drained dry of its magic by Queen Necrafa herself. The second generation of legendary Mysticons are: * Princess Arkayna Goodfey (voiced by Alyson Court) ‚Äì The eldest Princess Twin of Gemina and second Mysticon Dragon Mage, who is the fearless leader of the Mysticons. Her signature color is dark green and her symbol of mystical power is the dragon. Her Mysticon weapon is a staff that emits powerful green fire and can erect a protective shield. Her griffin companion is named Izzie. She initially disliked learning of the original four Mysticons from her mother, the Queen. She demonstrated telekinetic skill by mentally levitating a construction and converting it into a ramp; her eyes glow white while utilizing this ability. She eventually learns that she has a fraternal twin sister who was believed to be Proxima Starfall, one of the top Astromancers' strongest star mages. Later it is revealed that Zarya is her true twin sister, though they both welcome Proxima into \\"the sisterhood\\" as their honorary twin. Her romantic interest is the talented mid-level Astromancer, Malvaron Grimm. She grew up playing with the royal griffins and relies on her honor, determination and ideals to always do the right thing. However, she is mostly oblivious to the feelings of others; namely Proxima's deeply hurt feelings of betrayal and greater sense of loneliness and desertion towards her for never actually being there for her after learning that Zarya was her real twin sister. * Zarya Moonwolf (voiced by Nicki Burke) ‚Äì Chosen as the second Mysticon Ranger, she is thought to be an \\"orphaned pauper\\" who does her best to help other poor kids on the street, often acting as a big sister to them and Piper. She is wily and tough with a roguish charm. Her signature color is dark blue and her symbol of mystical power is the wolf. Her weapon is a shortbow from which she fires an array of mystical arrows. She is known as \\"the muscle\\" of the group. She first named her griffin \\"Stinky\\" because of his breath, but later renamed him \\"Archer\\". She is expelled from the team in \\"Scourge of the Seven Skies\\" and heads off alone. Her bracer and large blue book of Codex spells falls into the possession of Dreadbane who corrupts her Wolf Bracer. She eventually succeeds in getting them back. She temporarily replaces Arkayna as leader but refuses to take the position permanently. It is revealed that she had been the lost youngest twin princess and Arkayna's fraternal twin sister, having been left at Hortensia Sparklebottom's fairy orphanage for the first three years of her life, where Proxima was left at also as an infant fifteen years previously. * Piper Willowbrook (voiced by Ana Sani) ‚Äì An elf orphan who, along with Zarya, works to help fellow poor people in Drake City. She is Mysticon Striker. She is optimistic, energetic and fun- loving. Her signature colors are shades of yellow and blue and her symbol of mystical power is the phoenix. Her weapons are three yellow chakrams that act as boomerangs strong to render enemies unconscious from a distance. In addition, she can create sparkly yellow orbs which she calls her \\"pixie blast\\". Her griffin companion is named Miss Paisley, after a lost toy. She is known as \\"the party bringer\\" of the team. It is revealed that her name was given to her by Zarya when they first met as kids. Her full birth name is Pyperia Ashryn Elvanestri. Despite her youthful looks, she is revealed to be 110. She loves music and acrobatics and is a natural performer. * Emerald Zirconia Goldenbraid (voiced by Evany Rosen) ‚Äì A teenage dwarf who originally worked as the royal family's griffin wrangler and is the second Mysticon Knight. Called \\"Em\\" for short, she is smart, empathetic, innovative, and can engineer just about anything. Her signature color is purple and, at times, pink; her symbol of mystical power is the pink unicorn, which is the same color as the dark Basilisk Bracer belonging to her \\"dark\\" Vexicon counterpart Eartha. She can erect a pink orbicular shield around her and her fellow Mysticons. Her griffin companion is named Topaz. She is known to be \\"the heart\\" of the team. In addition to her mystic sword, she can use her dwarven gadgets to disable machinery from a distance or to seek out her fellow Mysticons if separated. She is given a legendary Silver Trident by Queen Truefin, as a gift for her bravery. Her boyfriend is the hunky Kasey Boon of the Pink Skulls. Vexicons Four, dark female warriors called from the pages of Proxima's Dark Codex. They debut as shadowed cameos at the end of \\"Happily Never After\\", but make their full debut in \\"The Lost Scepter\\" where they race the Mysticons to find an ancient and immensely powerful mind- controlling scepter that belonged to one of Gemina's centuries-old king. They are considered the dark counterparts of the Mysticons. They each have their own dark animal bracer, to combat those of light wielded by the Mysticons: *Mallory (voiced by TBA)The leader and Arkayna's evil counterpart. She has light blue skin, ice-white spiked hair and a blue staff with a jagged dark blue crystal which emits strong beams of icy, snowy energy. She also has an animal sidekick named Deeva, a pale aqua blue fox-like creature (Choko's evil counterpart) that she wears around her neck like a muffler. Her bracer is a serpent/snake, which she attacks with by calling out \\"Ice Serpent, Strike!\\"; the same color as Zarya's blue Wolf Bracer. She is the most rebellious of all four Vexicons, even attempting to overthrow her own creator and \\"mother.\\" She succeeds but is fully influenced by the fragment of the Spectral Hand's mask, just like Proxima was. She is later imprisoned with her sisters Kasha and Willa, and even her pet Deeva. *Kasha (voiced by TBA) - A orange cat-humanoid and Zarya's evil counterpart. She can emit three blasts of red energy from her claws. She also has skates that enable her to levitate in midair at high speeds. Her animal bracer is a bright orange panther, from which her attack phrase is \\"Shadow Panther, Pounce.\\" Ironically, she makes cat puns. *Eartha (voiced by TBA) - Large and muscular, and is Em's evil counterpart. Her body is made of solid stone and she can turn into a huge boulder-like ball of rock to carry the other three inside. Her animal bracer is pink basilisk, from which she calls out \\"Basilisk, Stampede!\\" as her attack phrase; same pink color as Emerald's Unicorn bracer. Her weapon is a large hammer, from which she can project a strong blast of pink energy. Out of all four Vexicons, she is the most polite and somewhat kinder. She ultimately defies her three sisters and now lives with Emerald at her hometown. *Willa (voiced by TBA)An imp with small, purple bat wings, and is Piper's evil counterpart. She has purple skin and can fire purple beams of energy from her hands. She can also teleport over short or long distances in a flash of purple smoke, namely by stating the phrase \\"Quicker than a flicker.\\" Her purple animal bracer is a bat; her attack phrase is \\"Fear the Nightmare\\". Her additional special ability is \\"Boom Doom\\" similar to Piper's \\"Pixie Blast\\" attack. She is ultimately imprisoned with Mallory, Kasha and Deeva. Animal Companions and sidekicks *Choko ‚Äì A fuzzy, white mole-like creature with pale pink ears who is Zarya's longtime friend and sidekick. He occasionally assists the Mysticons in some battles. He is quite adapt at recognizing ancient runes and mystic symbols of high magics. *Izzie ‚Äì Arkayna's loyal griffin friend since childhood. She is adorned in a dark green saddle and helmet that protect her enhanced eyesight from spiked attacks. *Topaz ‚Äì Emerald's faithful griffin mount. She is adorned in a purple blanket and helmet. *Miss Paisley ‚Äì Piper's griffin mount. She is adorned in a bright orange blanket. It is revealed that the name came from a stuffed griffin Piper had had as a child. *Archer ‚Äì Zarya's griffin mount whom she initially named \\"Stinky\\" because of his breath. She later named him Archer; likely due to her being capable of shooting mystical lightning-like arrows from her Mysticon Ranger short-bow. *Deeva- A pale aqua fox that is the evil counterpart of Choko, who came from Proxima's Dark Codex. She has purple eyes and a strong tail that she uses to push objects away in one swish. She appears as a muffler on Mallory's neck. *Dragon Mounts- In \\"Age of Dragons\\", the Mysticons had received four grown Dragons of Light after the dragon eggs went through the portal to the Ever Realm, where time flows faster. Each dragon is colored by each Mysticon's signature color: Princess Arkayna's dragon mount is a light green, Zarya's a pale blue, Piper's a light orange, and Emerald's light purple. Now astride these majestic and powerful creatures, the Mysticons had succeeded in firing their magnified bracers at the Spectral Hand, destroying it in one single strike. Royal Family of Gemina * Queen Goodfey (voiced by Linda Kash) ‚Äì Princess Arkayna's mother, Zarya Moonwolf's birth mother, King Consort Darius' second wife, Gawayne's stepmother and Queen of Gemina. Alongside her second husband and king consort, she oversees the training of her daughter, stepson and dwarf subject Emerald Goldenbraid on their griffin companions. She is turned to solid stone by Dreadbane's evil magic, and her absence prompted her arrogant and selfish stepson Gawayne to declare himself monarch in her place. She is temporarily revived, astonished at her daughter as the Dragon Mage, and assures Arkayna to be confident before reverting to stone. Her stone body falls into the depths of the sea and is given to a kraken as tribute by Queen Truefin; the Mysticons explain the situation and lift Goodfey's statue to the surface. It is later revealed that Goodfey has another daughter with purple hair and green eyes who grew up to be known as Zarya Moonwolf. She is finally fully restored to living flesh and blood at the end of \\"Fear the Spectral Hand\\" by Dreadbane himself. She is introduced to Zarya, having regained the brief memories of her youngest twin daughter by Nova Terron, and reluctantly gives her daughters and their fellow Mysticons the plans to greatly strengthening their animal bracers temporarily. Like her second husband and stepson, she will make many more appearances in the Mysticons comics and as a supporting character with more speaking roles. Her relationship with her late first husband, the old King Goodfey and biological father to the fraternal Princess Twins of Gemina, may also be revealed via flashbacks or pictures. * King Darius (voiced by Patrick McKenna) ‚Äì Queen Goodfey's second husband and king consort, Gawayne's father, and stepfather to the princess twins Arkayna and Zarya. He is turned to solid stone by Dreadbane in the very first episode. He is almost restored to living flesh by the combined mystical power of his stepdaughter and Malvaron, but ends up falling into the depths of the sea, where the Mer-Knights used him as tribute to a kraken. He was later brought to the surface and put in the palace throne room alongside his petrified wife. His bone form is finally revived at the end of Episode Thirty-Nine. He is to make appearances as a supporting character in the comics and chapter books. In actuality, there were several ancient kings during the B.C. eras the same name. * Acting King Gawayne (voiced by David Berni) ‚Äì Princess Arkayna and Zarya's selfish, spoiled and overweight stepbrother and the source of their many frustrations. After his father and stepmother were turned to bone statues, he is crowned Acting King of Gemina (dubbing himself \\"Gawayne the Great\\"), but was abducted and used to extort the Mysticons into handing over the Dragon Disk. In another episode he chooses his own safety over his people. At one point he obtains the orange and blue gems of Queen Necrafa. He gives the blue one to his pixie girlfriend, Lateensia, who dumps him afterward because of his selfishness, leaving him crushed. He tearfully attempts to persuade her to take him back, claiming that he will try to change. He writes letters to the bone statue of his father in secret, admitting that he would trade being king to have him back. At the Sky Lancers' Festival, e is surprised and not amused upon learning that his twin stepsisters were, in fact, Mysticon Dragon Mage and Mysticon Ranger all along. *King Goodfey ‚Äì He was the first husband of Queen Goodfey and king of Gemina for many years. Nothing more about him is revealed except that he had left to defend the world from some threat and was killed at some point. Unfortunately, he did not live to know of his fraternal daughters imminent separation due to a prophecy. He is first referenced in \\"The Prophecy Unleashed\\" in a fifteen-year flashback of his wife's; that she had wished that he could see hoe doubly blessed they had been with twin daughters. According to Nova Terron, it was demise that made Queen Goodfey resolve to protect all of Gemina by any means necessary which resulted in the incomplete create of mystical sky-lances called \\"the Lances of Justice.\\" Zarya's adopted family *Mr and Mrs. Moonwolf ‚Äì As she was raised during her early girlhood in Mrs. Sparklebottom's fairy orphanage, Zarya is said to have been taken in by the Moonwolfs who had raised her as their own daughter for several years, in a distant village outside Drake City. At the age of 12 she was abducted and forced to become a sky-pirate by the ruthless Captain Kaos. What became of her adoptive parents is unknown, though it is implied that they had died of unknown circumstances, as Zarya admitted that she misses her parents dearly. The only memento of her mother is a gold pendent set with a forest-green gemstone. Their first names have not yet been revealed, though their last name Zarya naturally took as her own. Emerald Goldenbraid's Family *Citrine Goldenbraid (voiced by TBA) ‚Äì Emerald's optimistic and overexcited mother who lives in a cottage in the town of Rudix Hollow. One of her family recipes is a soup that Zarya pretends to dislike. She gives Arkayna a hope ring that will give her strength in fulfilling her quest to stop Dreadbane. She believes that Emerald works in the castle as a griffin wrangler. She later pays her daughter a surprise visit for some quality mother-daughter time, and learns the truth about Em's Mysticon identity. She makes her Season Three appearances in \\"Total Eclipse of the Golden Heart,\\" \\"Heart of Stone\\", \\"Fear the Spectral Hand\\" and \\"Age of Dragons\\". In Volume 2 of the comic book series, he is twice referenced by his daughter. *Malachite Goldenbraid (voiced by TBA) ‚Äì Emerald's grumpy and cold father with whom she was very close as a child, calling her \\"Poo Twinkle\\" much to her chagrin. He is a dwarf engineer with a workshop in the cottage basement. He disapproved of his daughter's working at the castle, but admits that he had always been proud of her. He is the only one who knows of her identity as the second Mysticon Knight. He returns in \\"Heart of Stone\\" and \\"Age of Dragons.\\" In the graphic novels and original chapter books, she will appear as a supporting character. In Volume 2 of the comic book series, he is twice referenced by his daughter. *Halite and Ferrus Goldenbraid (voiced by TBA) ‚Äì Emerald's younger fraternal twin brothers who enjoy goofing off and embarrassing their older sister. They both have a crush on Piper and her cheery quirks. Halite has inherited his mother's hair while Ferrus has his father's hair color. They make their second appearance in Episode 35 \\"Heart of Stone.\\" Astromancers The Astromancers are an ancient league of mages (sorcerers and sorceresses) who have protected Gemina. They reside at the Astromancer Academy. Those of the top level have a deep purple magical aura while mid-level Astromancers have a light orange magical aura. =Top- level= * Nova Terron (voiced by Dan Lett) ‚Äì Holding the top rank of Star Master, he is a stern and bearded leader with a high-pitched voice. He sees the new Mysticons as failures whose incompetence will bring about the apocalypse, especially when they defy his order to destroy the complete Codex. He had been ordered by his master, Alpha Galiga, to separate the twin princesses, Arkayna and Zarya, as newborns. He came to enjoy playing the video game Avatars of the Apocalypse. *QuasarlaA female Astromancer who had fought alongside the original Mysticons during their battle against Queen Necrafa. She was eventually overpowered and turned into a mindless, masked Spectromancer by her fellow Astromancer colleague Proxima. * Tazma Grimm (voiced by Michelle Monteith) ‚Äì Malvaron's older sister who favors training over natural talent and is chosen to train the Mysticons. She later betrays them and the Astromancers to obtain power for herself. She was the Shadow Mage who had forced Zarya and Piper to steal the Dragon Disk in exchange for Choko in the first episode. She later seems to have second thoughts about Dreadbane's leadership, calling him weak and incompetent. Tazma partners with Kymraw to claim the complete Codex from the Mysticons but is betrayed; she is horrified when Dreadbane uses it to release Queen Necrafa. She informs Necrafa of the new Mysticons and joins her for vengeance. Tazma is saved from being destroyed with the lair of the Spectral Hand and imprisoned in a snow-globe for her crimes. She was eventually freed by her reluctant younger brother and took the chance to escape by teleporting away in a flash of shadowy smoke. She remains at large in the realm after the defeat of the Spectral Hand. *Proxima Starfall (voiced by Stacey DePass) ‚Äì A short orphan with red glasses, a black bob-cut hairstyle, and pale tan skin. Her innate magical strength is exceptional and she has more experience in high-star technology than most top- level Astromancers. She offers to use her magic to locate the Mysticons per Nova Terron's orders. She later demands that they be \\"brought to justice\\" in retaliation for Emerald giving her a star-shaped scar on her right cheek. She had always felt like she was missing an essential part of herself, which seems to be explained when she was believed to be the lost princess of Gemina and Arkayna's fraternal twin. However, she was merely a decoy to protect the real twin princess, Zarya. To gain revenge on the Mysticons for making her believe that she was loved and wanted in the realm, she secretly kept the sinister fragment of Queen Necrafa's evil mask, allowing its dark power to consume her soul. She then corrupts the Dragon Disk, and creates her very own Dark Codex, from which she calls forth the Vexicons. While the Vexicons distract the Mysticons, Proxima continues her plot to achieve her full revenge on the oblivious Arkayna for not being there for her and choosing to abandon her, ever since she discovered that Zarya was her true twin sister. She eventually came to regret allowing the dark power within the mask fragment to consume her and intends to toss it back into the Rift of Ruin. Unfortunately for her, it has long since been attached to her intensely bitter feelings of loneliness, hatred and betrayal and has now taken full control of her troubled mind and body in full measure. Her tormented mind is later intruded by the Mysticons, with the help of Tazma, in an attempt to break the stronger hold Necrafa's mask now has upon her by finding the \\"Free Psyche\\" spell. She makes amends by revealing what she has learned about the Spectral Hand itself, and reverses the spell she cast on the Astromancers. In the end, she is given the untainted, gold Dragon Disk and still-powerless Codex by Nova Terron, who resigns as leader of the Astromancers to stay with his longtime starmate Geraldine by going off on inter-dimensional adventures with her, and gives the topmost position of \\"Star Mistress\\" to the teenage orphan. =Mid-level= * Malvaron Grimm (voiced by Deven Mack) ‚Äì A young, talented male mid-level Astromancer who is stationed in the palace. He becomes the Mysticons' new instructor in mystical abilities. He has romantic feelings for Arkayna, which are expressed somewhat when he admitted that he was scared that he might lose her. Unlike top-level Astromancers, his exceptionally powerful innate magical aura is colored light orange; the same as his aunt Geraldine Yaga. He is the love interest and starmate of Princess Arkayna. =Low-level= * Douglaphius Hadderstorm (voiced by Doug Hadders) ‚Äì A large cyclops Astromancer and friend of Malvaron. He becomes Malvaron's assistant in training the new Mysticons. He has an obsession with a tiny child's collectible called \\"Twinkly Mare\\" and \\"Twinkly Dragon\\". Even though he is in the Order of the Astromancers, he seems to possess no magical abilities whatsoever, which he himself officially confirms in The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon chapter book of not having any \\"flashy powers.\\" He goes by \\"Doug\\" for short. Spectral Hand * Queen Necrafa (voiced by Valerie Buhagiar) ‚Äì Leader and witch queen of the sinister Spectral Hand who was defeated by the original Mysticons a thousand years ago. Dreadbane intends to resurrect her with the Dragon Disk, though it is later implied she is imprisoned in another dimension which Dreadbane intends to breach. Once she is released, she double-crosses her devoted general by hurling him into the dark world where she was trapped. She similarly uses the Codex, draining its magic to rejuvenate herself and amplify her power, before hurling it through the gateway. Necrafa doubts Tazma's word that there are new Mysticons, and regards them as mere children when she confronts them in Drake City. Necrafa joins with the Spectral Dragon but is destroyed by Arkayna and Zarya who bonded together and turned into twin dragons. However, a fragment of the skeletal mask she wore is left behind. It is revealed that she was originally a powerful elf, highly gifted in ancient elf magics, whose entire being was fully consumed by the mask of the Spectral Hand, turning her into undead lich-queen of pure evilness. This implies that she is/was distantly related to Piper. * General Dreadbane (voiced by Deven Mack) ‚Äì The undead leader of the skeleton army who loves Necrafa and seeks to steal the Dragon Disk to resurrect her. He eventually succeeds but she rejects his feelings and hurls him into her former prison, an inter-dimensional world of darkness. He is discovered there by Tazma and the Mysticons who came searching for the Codex. Having lost his memory he calls himself \\"Reginald\\" and had built a flower garden as an expression of his unrequited love. In a bizarre turn of events, he attacks Tazma, warning that Necrafa will betray her. He later uses Zarya's mystical bowstring to return to his lair. He takes the yellow mystic rings to give to Necrafa, but comes to see that she used him; He throws the rings down and he leaves. He returns in \\"Fear the Spectral Hand\\" in which he was revealed to have a mighty Sky Lancer who defended the realm bravely until he was tainted by the evil forces of the Spectral Hand; thus becoming the undead skeleton Dreadbane. In an act of self-sacrifice he reverses the spell of petrification on the King and Queen, and makes Princess Arkayna promise to defend the city he loves before expiring into the stars. * Skeleton/Spectral Army ‚Äì Hundreds of undead skeletons who work for Queen Necrafa and Dreadbane. Once Necrafa is released, she uses her magnified powers to give them \\"a makeover\\" by turning them into hooded spectral-like creatures. They were ultimately destroyed by the Princess Twin Dragons in one single strike. * Spectromancers ‚Äì As of \\"Happily Never After\\", dozens of top-level Astromancers (including Nova Terron, Gandobi, and Quasarla) were all quickly overpowered by Proxima and turned into her masked, mindless minions. Proxima proclaimed herself the new leader and Queen of the Spectral Hand; her very first command was for them to kneel before her as she corrupted the Dragon Disk. She then had them utilize the ancient starfire ink she had stolen for her to effectively create her very own Dark Codex. After Proxima was released from the mask's darker hold, she reversed the spell which turned them back into Astromancers. Pink Skulls A group of sky pirates who plunder and pillage whatever they find. They were founded several years ago when Zarya was a young orphan girl in Drake City. *Kitty Boon (voiced by TBA) ‚Äì Captain of the Pink Skulls and Zarya's childhood friend. She takes advantage of this relationship to incapacitate the Mysticons and obtain the Dragon Disk, which she sells to Dreadbane. She later fights alongside the Mysticons, and on a third occasion gives Zarya inspiration to thwart Necrafa's plans. She is later revealed to be Zarya's romantic love interest. In the comic books, she debuts in Volume 2. *Kasey Boon (voiced by TBA) ‚Äì Kitty's younger brother who Emerald developed a crush on. He gave her a bracelet which was revealed to be a tracking device to follow the Mysticons. He later appears to have second thoughts about taking advantage of Em's feelings for him, and catches her, after which the two have a serious romance. In the comics, he debuts in Volume 2. Mer-Knights of the Silver Trident Fierce and brave mermaid/mermen warriors who possess the ancient and very powerful silver tridents of myth. According to Emerald, children's tales of them have been famous for many, many years: *Princess Kelpie Truefin (voiced by TBA) ‚Äì A young and tough mermaid warrior and daughter of Queen Truefin who crosses paths with the Mysticons during their search of the ocean depths, for the bone statues of Princess Arkayna's mother and stepfather. Distrusting them, she zaps Zarya and Arkayna with her silver trident and accuses them of trespassing. She makes a second appearance in \\"The Mask\\" along with her mother. *Queen Truefin (voiced by TBA) ‚Äì Queen of the Mer-Knights of the Silver Trident, who has the statues of Goodfey and Darius in her possession, with the intent of sacrificing them to a vicious kraken. She initially mistrusts the Mysticons, but works alongside them to stop the kraken. She apologizes for her actions by giving Emerald one of her silver tridents. Dragons of Light Millennium ago, the ancient and mighty Dragons of Light had fought a fiercely violent final battle in their sacred homeland of Dragonhenge. Unfortunately, thousands had fallen and were thought to be extinct at the hand of one of the Spectral Dragons. Until a dragon egg was discovered by the second generation of Mysticons, which hatched an infant storm dragon whom Arkayna decided to christen \\"Stormy.\\" *King Valmuk (voiced by TBA) ‚Äì The king of Dragonhenge and the majestic, mighty ruler of the Dragons of Light. He had mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen or heard from again for the next thousand years. His renowned wife and queen Auratha had tragically perished alongside most of their fellow dragons. It is revealed that he had been living among the citizens of the modern world as a panhandler called \\"Snor-y Dude\\" by the Mysticons, due him always snoring and begging for a gold coin. In \\"The Edge of Two Morrows\\", it was he who had sent Piper into an alternate reality, so she could learn to embrace her destiny as a Mysticon. He revealed his true form to the Mysticons, in \\"The Last Dragon\\" so he could take Stormy home and unite her with their family who have been hidden in a secret location at Dragonhenge, a cavern full of dragon eggs. He makes a second and final appearance in \\"Age of Dragons\\", as the Mysticons require his wisdom and ancient power in putting an end to the Spectral Hand once and for all. *Stormy ‚Äì An infant storm dragon who had been found by the second generation of legendary Mysticons, in the sewers of Drake City. Due to her weather-controlling abilities, Arkayna christened her \\"Stormy\\" and vowed to keep her safe, as she was the last of her kind. When King Valmuk revealed himself, he and Stormy flew off to Dragonhenge, where he used his ancient dragon fire to reveal a hidden cavern, in which were dozens of surviving golden dragon eggs. *Dragon Mounts ‚Äì Four of the dozens of baby dragons that had resided in the yellow eggs, hidden secretly in a cave of Dragonhenge and had escaped total death and annihilation by the original Spectral Dragon. After going through the swirling portal to the Ever Realm, the four returned as full-fledged Dragons of Light instantaneously. Each one is colored in the Mysticons' signature color: **Pale green for Arkayna **Pale blue for Zarya **Pale orange for Piper **Pale purple for Emerald They seem to have replaced the everlasting faithful griffin mounts- Izzie, Archer, Miss Paisley and Topaz- as the Mysticons are seen on the dragons backs in the last scene of the show. Supporting Characters * Neeko (voiced by Cory Doran) ‚Äì A homeless orphan with short pink hair. He is given a bag of food that Zarya and Piper stole. Zarya always tells him to \\"keep the magic real\\", implying that he may possess inherent magical abilities. He is surprised to learn that Zarya was a Mysticon the whole time in \\"Game of Phones.\\" * Serena Snakecharmer (voiced by Julie Lemieux) ‚Äì A gorgon reporter who has wiggly blonde hair of live snakes, one of which is named Serena. She dons sunglasses during her big reports. She reported live on the coronation of Gwayne \\"the Great\\", and got a closer look at Arkayna gate-crashing the party as the Dragon Mage. Her last appearance was in \\"The Foz Who Saved Lotus Night\\" when she was turned full zombie. *Kymraw (voiced by Linda Kash) ‚Äì A gruff female troll who leads a biker gang and speaks in the third person. She aided in the abduction of recently crowned King Gwayne. She swore vengeance on the Mysticons, and attempts to take it on later occasions. She gave Dreadbane information on the Codex when she overheard Piper's boasting. She betrays Tazma and hands over the completed Codex to Dreadbane for two gold-filled treasure chests, stating that \\"double- cross means double pay.\\" She is eventually hypnotized by Tazma into doing her biding as payment for this double-cross. *Barnabas Dinklelot ‚Äì A troll who is a security guard at the mall where the second Codex spellbook was found by Piper. He also likes Twinkly Mare and gave one to Doug as a token of their adventure together. He later shows holographic stories of the leader of the original Mysticons, Imani Firewing, and her final battle against Necrafa. In Season 2, he narrates the heroic tale \\"The Foz Who Saved Lotus Night\\" to several foz. *Imani Firewing- One thousand years ago, she was chosen as the first Dragon Mage and leader of the original Mysticons, who had perished defending the realm of Gemina from Queen Necrafa. First appearing in a flashback in \\"The Astromancer Job\\", she was the last of her generation of Mysticons standing against Dreadbane in the wasteland of Victory Heights; she defeated Necrafa by unleashing the powers of her mystical \\"Bracer of the Heavens\\", imprisoning Necrafa in a far-off world, but this caused Imani to lose her own life. A statue of her is in the royal treasury and on the Hill of Heroes alongside her fellow Mysticons. In \\"The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon\\" novel, it is revealed that she was deeply afraid of foz. *The Original Mysticon Ranger- A human teenage boy who was chosen by the Dragon Disk, a millennia ago, as Mysticon Ranger. His name was never revealed but he seemed to have been a tough adversary for Dreadbane and his skeleton army until he was killed under unknown circumstances, leaving his good friend and teammate, Imani, to finish Queen Necrafa on her own at the cost of her life. To honor his heroic legacy, a stone statue of him is in the Treasury in the royal castle and in the Hill of Heroes. In The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon, his female successor, Zarya Moonwolf, had seen him fighting Orcs in a holographic image using a net-arrow technique, which she used in \\"Game of Phones\\". *The Original Mysticon Striker- A female elf who became the very first Mysticon Striker, a thousand years ago. Like her successor, Piper, she was closer to the human boy who was the original Mysticon Ranger. Her name is not revealed and she was killed under unknown circumstances. Her statue is next to those of her fellow Mysticons as a monument of her bravery until death. In The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon, Piper referred to her as the old version of her. *The Original Mysticon Knight- A male dwarf who was the predecessor of dwarven Emerald Goldenbraid. He wielded the mystical Star Sword as his weapon, as Emerald does, but it was said in The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon that he had used a broadsword. Just as with Ranger and Striker, his name and background were never revealed as there were not more than forty episodes, and had died mysteriously before Queen Necrafa's ultimate defeat and imprisonment at the hands of Imani's light golden-colored Dragon Bracer. His statue is alongside those of his fellow Mysticons in the Treasury and Hill of Heroes at the Astromancers Island. *Geraldine Yaga Grimm (voiced by Lili Franks) ‚Äì Is a powerful top-level Astromancer, and Malvaron and Tazma Grimm's aunt. She is an astral traveler who hops from dimension to dimension but seeks refuge in Centaur Park once a year. According to her nephew, she is a minor demigoddess who is eccentric and loves cake. She is deceived by Tazma, who claims that Zarya and Emerald had stolen her magical artifacts and spellbooks. After Geraldine is overpowered by Emerald releasing her Unicorn Bracer's mystical power, she sends Tazma away for a \\"time out\\" and cures Zarya of a life- draining spell. She then heads off for the magical kingdom of Arizona. Besides being telepathic, it is implied that she can foresee the future. She eventually is tasked with being the guardian and caretaker of Proxima, to keep her safe from Tazma and Queen Necrafa, by welcoming the long-lost Princess of Gemina to stay with her in the dimension of Earth. *Captain Kaos (voiced by Jamie Waston) ‚Äì A large parrot-like creature who is captain of a pirate crew; he had attacked the village where Zarya and Kitty lived as young children. In retaliation for later marooning him on a desert island, he returns and abducts Kasey to lure Zarya and Kitty into a trap. He hypnotizes them into following him to the island's ancient ruins (that is ultimately revealed to be the Spectral Hand itself), where a malevolent force seeks to devour their souls. However, Zarya utilizes her Wolf Bracer to push him down into the ruins which devours his entire being. It is later revealed that he was one of many who was manipulated by the Spectral Hand. *Alpha Galaga- The strongest of top Astromancers who was star master to a younger Nova Terron in the era of the original Mysticons who had died mysteriously and the only one who knew the full contents of the prophecy that would bring upon Gemina's imminent annihilation, which he passed on to his protege, whom he ordered to separate the fraternal Princess Twins of Gemina as the prophecy spoke of \\"the royal twins\\". At one point, he had joined with the Mysticons to create the snowy Chillwaste dimension for Adakite Flowstone. *Hortensia Q. Sparklebottom ‚Äì The overprotective matron of the orphanage where Proxima was raised. She dotes on children and is determined to keep them safe from harm. She had deliberately planted the evidence of Proxima being Arkayna's long-lost twin sister by placing her blue-green birth gem in the vault of the dragon, to protect Zarya's true identity. She is shown to have done this many years ago, at the time when Nova Terron had came to give the younger princess twin a foz balloon for her starday. It was then that Hortensia had switched the toddler Zarya with toddler Proxima, who happened to be right next to the true royal twin at the time. *Lance O'Lovely ‚Äì A gnome who was once a popular singer of the boy band Gnomes to Men which played at Gawayne's coronation. He is a celebrity idolized by Emerald, Piper and Doug. According to Emerald, he sang his way from the streets to fame and fortune. However, he is revealed to be a fraud who used a magic microphone to rob former-bandmate Vesper of her talent. *Vesper ‚Äì A banshee who headed the band Vesper and the Phantoms, but backup singer Lance O'Lovely robbed her of her magical singing voice, leaving her with only her ground-shattering, ultrasonic screams and deafening subsonic screeches. She returned to reclaim her magical voice and become a celebrity singer. *Mr. Snellson- The male snail and librarian of the mythical Library of the Eternal Equinox. He is the powerful enforcer who enforces the rules of the library. Debuting in \\"Happily Never After\\", he is unable to help the Mysticons prevent Proxima from stealing ancient starfire ink. *Adakite Flowstone- An ancient female dwarf who debuted in The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon book, in which she managed to convince Emerald Goldenbraid to turn to the other Mysticons for assistance in releasing her and \\"restoring her\\" to a physical body after one thousand years of imprisonment in the Chillwaste. Long ago, she was friends with the original Mysticon Dragon Mage, Imani Firewing, even before she was chosen as leader of the Mysticons. Adakite had fought alongside Imani and her fellow Mysticons for a while and passed herself off as \\"Mysticon Rogue\\" with flaming daggers as her weapon. *Amileth- An elf who is a skilled illusionist in storing magic in special lights. She was given the title \\"the Amazing Amileth and her Extraordinary Illusions\\". Series elements Magical artifacts *The Dragon Disk ‚Äì A supremely powerful artifact which is sentient and has a will of its own. It had belonged to the original Mysticons and became dormant after their sacrifice to stop Queen Necrafa. Every few centuries it chooses four new Mysticons to defend Gemina. It falls into the hands of Dreadbane who wished to use it to revive Necrafa. The Mysticons make an exact duplicate of the Disk from four items gathered across the realm. Kitty later manages to retrieve it and gives to Zarya to make amends for her actions. It became one with the completed Codex by affixing itself to its dark green cover, but was later torn off by Tazma and presented to Necrafa, who revealed the prophecy predicting imminent doom for the realm. It was recovered and presented to Nova Terron by Malvaron but was taken and corrupted by a vengeful Proxima, turning it from a golden-yellow to a deep blood-red. It is then affixed to Proxima's Dark Codex, which further increases its already powerful dark magic to significant levels. *The Codex ‚Äì An ancient and powerful tome that is the main source of the Mysticons' strength and abilities. It was split into four separate books of spells, along with mystic bracers, and scattered across Gemina for safekeeping. Once found, each Mysticon has her own book of spells and bracer that contains the symbol of the dragon, the phoenix, the wolf and the unicorn. When all four spellbooks are combined, it amplifies their mystical abilities a hundred times. After it is used to release Necrafa from her prison, she commands it to fill her with its immense power, rejuvenating her and magnifying her dark powers. Necrafa then disposed of the Codex in the dark realm where she had been trapped. The Mysticons eventually recover it with the unexpected aid of Dreadbane. Unfortunately, it has been completely drained of all of its magic since Queen Necrafa had commanded it to \\"fill her with its power\\" upon her release in Episode Thirteen. In addition to its four spellbooks, each Mysticon dons a jeweled bracer that represents their own animal which can also be used underwater: *Dragon Bracer ‚Äì Arkayna's bright green bracer unleashes a roaring green dragon that can carry others and cause intense damage to its target. Its attack phrase is \\"Unleash the Dragon!\\", though at times it is \\"Release the Dragon!\\" It is the most used. *Phoenix Bracer‚Äì Piper's bracer which can unleash intense fiery power, just like Arkayna's mystical Dragon bracer. Its attack phrase is \\"Fly, Phoenix, Fly!\\" *Wolf Bracer‚Äì Zarya's light blue-colored mystical bracer that was once corrupted in the possession of Dreadbane. It was the last to be recovered by the Mysticons, but the third to be found. Unlike the other three, Zarya does not call out the animal it represents; its attack phrase being \\"Time to Howl!\\" It is colored a light blue, the same color as Mallory's Snake Bracer. *Unicorn Bracer ‚Äì Emerald's bright pink bracer which has healing powers. Its attack phrase is \\"Battle Unicorn, Charge!\\" Emerald had gained it in \\"A Walk in the Park.\\" It is the same pink color as Eartha's Basilisk Bracer. Other magical objects *Queen Necrafa's Necklace ‚Äì Necrafa used this as protection against the animal bracers mystic abilities of the original four Mysticons. When she was defeated, its four gems were scattered. It was found by Dreadbane who was transformed into a skeletal figure when he touched it. It is destroyed in \\"The Dragon's Rage\\" along with its wearer. *The Mask of the Spectral Hand- A sinister-looking, skeletal object that Queen Necrafa (who was, in fact, originally a very powerful elven sorceress) donned, covering her mouth completely. She switches to her second face to emit an exceptionally powerful burst of red energy which acts as a hypersonic shriek. However, it appears to possess evil magic of its own, as a fragment of the mask was capable of taking possession of Kelpie and Queen Truefin's minds. This fragment appears to have fed on Proxima's feelings of loneliness and hatred, and she willingly hid it from the Mysticons. She now wears its fragment on the left side of her face, proclaiming herself the new leader of the Spectral Hand, allowing its dark power to feed off her bitter feelings of loneliness, abandonment and betrayal. As a result, it has become strongly attracted to Proxima, to the point of making her desire to wipe out the entire realm of Gemina in the process of revenge on Arkayna, and to point of taking full possession of her body and mind. However, Mallory still coveted it and its dark untold power. It was finally destroyed in its entirety by Zarya, who threw it into the Rift of Ruin. *The Dark Codex- After snatching and corrupting the ancient, all-powerful Dragon Disk, turning it from bright gold to blood-red, a thoroughly vengeful and heartbroken Proxima had her mindless Spectromancers use ancient starfire ink to effectively create her very own Codex book of dark spells. Once she affixed the tainted Dragon Disk to it, she used her darker, and far more powerful star magic to call upon the Vexicons; four female warriors to combat the Mysticons. it also contains steps to finding special ingredients to creating certain objects of powerful evil magic; such as wave resonators. What became of the Dark Codex remains unknown, as no further display of its evil magics have been revealed by Proxima, and that the Dragon Disk had been eventually removed from its gray cover (off- screen). Magical weaponry These are the four immensely powerful magic- infused weaponry belonging to the Mysticons, four legendary heroes who defend the realm of Gemina and its people from any evil. They were created by the ancient, all-powerful Dragon Disk which had chosen the original Mysticons a millennia ago. They are used constantly rather than the special power each Mysticon possesses: *Dragon Mage Staff ‚Äì The weapon of the Dragon Mage, signifying her as leader of the team. It has a light green glass orb in its center which emits strong and blazing green-colored flames. It can convert this fiery energy into other shapes, such as a net, a shield or rope. *Ranger Bow and Arrow ‚Äì Weapon of the Mysticon Ranger, which fires a lightning-like arrow. It can also be converted into a rope or even a net to retain targets from a short distance. On some occasions, Zarya fired two lightning arrows at once. *Striker Energy Hoops ‚Äì Three golden chakrams that act as boomerangs when thrown and can knock out multiple enemies from a distance. They can also expand to be used as a grappling hook or rope. *Knight Star Sword ‚Äì Weapon of Mysticon Knight, which can generate a powerful wave of pink mystical energy to cut through solid objects. In The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon chapter book, the unnamed Mysticon Knight (who was a male dwarf) had wielded a purple-and- pink broadsword. *Knight Energy Shield- A pink/magenta-colored energy shield wielded by Emerald, with which she defends herself and her friends by altering it into various shapes of protection; a circle, sphere or even a small dome. She can even surf on it for faster midair transportation. It has not been confirmed whether this is a weapon or an actual special ability of Mysticon Knight. Vexicon weapons These are the magic-infused weapons of the Vexicons, the four evil counterparts of the Mysticons. Each is somewhat similar to the weapons of light wielded by the Mysticons. Only Willa does not display any actual weapon, but prefers her Vexicon abilities; her \\"Doom Boom\\" attack and teleporting via purple smoke. *Crystal Ice Staff- The weapon of Mallory, the blue-skinned ambitious and power-mad leader of the Vexicons. It is the evil counterpart to the green Dragon Mage Staff wielded by Princess Arkayna as Mysticon Dragon Mage. As opposed emitting green fire/flames from it, this blue staff generates strong ice/snow/frost magic; capable of projecting a strong blast of snowy magic, encase victims in ice cubes, and erect an orb of ice for defense. In place of a light green lotus on its mount, it has a deep blue jagged crystal. *Feline Energy Claws- Being a humanoid feline, Kasha uses her catlike claws to fire a stream of red-white claws of a type of evil energy that can scratch victims from a distance. *Hammer- The weapon of Eartha, the \\"evil\\" counterpart of Emerald. She does not use it every time she appears, as her fellow Vexicons do with their weaponry, but she can project a strong beam of dark pink energy from it if need to. *Snake Bracer- Light blue bracer in the shape of snake that Mallory uses to clash with the bright green Dragon Bracer used by Princess Arkayna. Its attack is \\"Ice Serpent, Strike!\\" *Panther Bracer- An orange bracer that unleashes an orange panther from it when used by Kasha, which counters the light blue Wolf Bracer fired by Zarya. Its phrase is \\"Shadow Panther, Pounce!\\" *Bat Bracer- Light purple bracer used by purple teleporting imp Willa. It counters Piper's yellow Phoenix Bracer. Its phrase \\"Fear the Nightmare!\\" which is not based on a bat. *Basilisk Bracer- Dark pink bracer used by Eartha the golem, which is the least used of all four Vexicon bracers. Like Emerald's Unicorn Bracer, it is colored pink. Its phrase is \\"Basilisk Stampede!\\" Other magical weapons *The Silver Trident ‚Äì An extremely powerful and dangerous object that is the main weapon and symbol of the merpeople of the Silver Trident. These can emit lightning bolts of white electric energy and erect a transparent dome-shaped shield. Emerald is given one in recognition of her bravery. It is later shown able to grant marine physiology to those who cannot otherwise breathe underwater. *Queen Necrafa's Scepter - A long thin skeletal staff with a red crystal orb in its center. Necrafa can use it to teleport via red portals, erect powerful force-fields, and mutate her skeleton-like servants into hooded Specters. It is destroyed by the combined forces of the Princess Twins of Gemina (combined strength of Princess Arkayna and Zarya), who had transformed into the green-and-blue Twin Dragon by tapping into the magic of two yellow rings. *Proxima's Scepter ‚Äì This long and thin golden staff was presumably created in secret via the Celestial Forge. It further develops and drastically magnifies all of Proxima's already powerful star magic to even greater levels. She demonstrated its power by turning Nova Terron and other Astromancers into Spectromancers. From it, she emits powerful bursts of blood-red dark star magic. *Lances of Justice- After the old king (Princess Arkayna and Zarya's birth father) had suddenly died defending the realm from evildoers, a grieved Queen Goodfey had dedicated her life to protecting all of Gemina to ensure her husband's demise was not in vain. She ordered that Nova Terron create magical lances that had the ability to further increase the mystical animal bracers of the Mysticons, thus strengthening their attack power. The plans to create them had been hidden in Queen Goodfey's necklace for safekeeping. They were forged in the magic furnace of the drawvn mines, at Rudix Hollow, by each of the Mysticons. Each lance is colored in the Mysticons' signature color. Powers and abilities These are the unique superpowers and abilities each of the four Mysticons possess, but for some reason are never used or relied upon as constantly as their weapons are. Some are psionic/psychic/extrasensory, while others are what fairies and pixies possess. Only the special abilities of Zarya Moonwolf and Emerald Goldenbraid were never revealed in the show: *Telekinesis- The one of many that the brave leader of the Mysticons, Mysticon Dragon Mage, alone possess. Princess Arkayna Goodfey first utilizes this psionic ability to telekinetically create a ramp for the midair limousine to escape Kymraw, in Episode Three. Her eyes glow white, and a telekinetic aura is seen around her hands in a light green, though at one point, a darker greenish aura glowed around the rocks she psionically moved in \\"The Prophecy Unleashed\\", likely due to her telekinesis being given a boost from her rage and fury. *Pixie Blast- Is the fairy-related special power of Piper Willowbrook as the second Mysticon Striker. She emits a stream of bright yellow, glittery fairy dust from her hands which dazzles her enemies from a distance.

Printed media Original adventures A miniseries of five chapter books, featuring one of the second generation of the four Mysticons as the central character. For some reason, no news of Piper Willowbrook's original tale has been known yet. Emerald's tale is set sometime in the first season; whereas Princess Arkayna and Zarya's are set in the second, as both mention of them being long-lost fraternal twin sisters. *The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon (featuring Emerald \\"Em\\", the second Mysticon Knight) *The Stolen Magic (featuring Zarya, the second Mysticon Ranger) *The Diamond Curse(featuring Princess Arkayna, the second Mysticon Dragon Mage) *TBA(featuring Piper, the second Mysticon Striker) Comics One year that the animated show aired on Nickelodeon, August 28, 2017, an ever-expanding series of graphic novels/comic books have been released once or twice a year.

Die K√∂nigsklasse deutscher Unternehmen in Wort und Bild. Deutsche Standards Editionen, K√∂ln 2010, . (german) History Friedrich Jungheinrich founded H. Jungheinrich & Co. Maschinenfabrik on August 7, 1953 in Hamburg. The first foreign branch was opened in Austria in 1956. In 1958, the company headquarters opened with a plant in Hamburg-Wandsbek. On July 11, 1960, Jungheinrich AG was founded as a Swiss subsidiary under the name \\"Ameise GmbH\\", headquartered in Aarau. A site in Friedrichsgabe in today‚Äôs Norderstedt was acquired in 1966 and production was gradually relocated from Hamburg to this site until 1984. The company founder Friedrich Jungheinrich died on January 28, 1968. In 1974, the rental and used truck business started with its own organization. The new plant in L√ºneburg was built in 1989. The first Eastern European branches were established in the Czech Republic and Hungary in 1991. In 1994, Jungheinrich acquired the Steinbock und Boss Group. The production facilities in France, Great Britain and Spain were closed and production was relocated to Germany. In 2002, the Group brands MIC, Steinbock and Boss were abandoned and since then, trucks have only been sold under the Jungheinrich brand name. The Dr. Friedrich Jungheinrich Foundation was established in 2004 to promote scholarships for students specialized in mechanical engineering or industrial engineering. In 2005, the company presented the world's first forklift with a rotating cab. In 2006, an assembly plant opened in Qingpu near Shanghai, China. Electric pedestrian-controlled pallet trucks are assembled here. The manufactured low-platform and high- platform trucks are used to supply Jungheinrich's sales operations in China and the Asian market. Also in 2006, the Dresden Used Equipment Centre for the reconditioning of used trucks commenced operations.In 2009, Jungheinrich started the production of battery-powered low-platform trucks at its new plant in Landsberg in Saxony-Anhalt. In 2013, a plant for warehouse and system trucks was inaugurated in Moosburg an der Isar, the new central warehouse for spare parts in Kaltenkirchen and the new plant for industrial trucks for the Asia-Pacific region in Qingpu. At the beginning of October 2015, a new spare parts warehouse went into operation at the Kuzayevo site near Moscow. This is operated by logistics service provider K√ºhne + Nagel Contract Logistics and is intended to supply not only Jungheinrich customers in Russia,but also in its neighboring states, with spare parts. At the end of 2015, the company also took over the Munich-based MIAS Group, which specializes in mechanical engineering in warehouse logistics. On July 1, 2015, Jungheinrich also expanded the Board of Management to include the Logistics Systems Division under Klaus-Dieter Rosenbach. In 2018, Jungheinrich generated sales revenue of 3.796 billion euros with 17,877 employees. The head office is located in Hamburg-Wandsbek, where the company movedinto its own new building at the beginning of 2016. Its design was created by the Hamburg architectsProf. Klaus Sill & Assoziierte, with MBN Bau AG, Georgsmarienh√ºtte, as general contractor, carrying out the construction work. Stock exchange listing In 1990, the domestic companies merged and subsequently traded as a joint stock company, which went public with preference shares and was listed for the first time on August 30, 1990. The ordinary shares, and thus the entrepreneurial control, still remain with the families of the two daughters of the company founder. Until December 3, 2014, the Jungheinrich share was a component of the SDAX. With effect from December 4, 2014, the share was listed in the MDAX. On September 24, 2018, it switched back to the SDAX.

Mwakigwena Choir used to perform for the then president Jomo Kenyatta in the late 1970s  Early life  Enock Ondego was born in Mazigolo, South Maragoli in Vihiga County in 1930, and completed his elementary and high school at Kaimosi.  Career  Ondego Meets Uhuru Kenyatta When he was 17, Ondego started teaching in a local primary school in an attempt to support his family, as he was the eldest son. However, he soon left to join the pre-independence struggle for African political rights. He ran for an election, but lost. After the election, he went back to teaching and was posted to a school in the Kwale district, named Samburu primary school, at Maji ya Chumvi. Ondego discovered his interest in music whilst teaching at the school, and started composing songs. After Kenyan independence, he became the first Kenyan teacher to sing for the then president Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. So impressed was Jomo by Ondego's music that he elected him head of the presidential music association in 1969. It was at exactly the same period that Ondego recorded the song Kenya ni Nchi ya Ajabu. This song was stirred by horrendous acts he had witnessed of the then British British Colonial System in Kenya against the Black majority. The song was adopted by KBC then called Voice of Kenya as an intro song to their news bulletin. According to Enock, However, this was contrived without his knowledge or concurrence and he therefore has not in any way benefited from the use of his song by KBC. Enock filed a lawsuit against KBC in 2010 seeking to be remunerated, It was decided that he be paid the sum of Kshs. 50 million but has allegedly not been reimbursed. When Mzee Jomo Kenyatta died in 1978, Enock composed yet another song, praising the late president. The song, Wimbo huu ni wimbo wa Historia is a delineation of the tribulations of Kenyatta and the other Kapenguria Six detainees when they were apprehended in 1952 and detained without trial. It also tells of the Kisumu riots that met Jomo when he visited Kisumu on 29 October 1969. The song was passed down as a theme song for the iniquitous Kenyatta Day celebrations up to when the holiday was renamed Mashujaa Day  References  Category:Kenyan Luhya people Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:Kenyan musicians Category:Kenyan writers Category:21st-century Kenyan musicians Category:21st- century Kenyan writers Category:20th-century Kenyan musicians Category:20th- century Kenyan writers Category:20th-century Kenyan singers ","title":"Enock Ondego"},{"id":"39064728","text":"Contemporary art in Egypt is a term used to visual art including installations, videos, paintings, sculptures developed in the Egyptian art scene. While the Contemporary Art scene is mainly concentrated in Cairo and Alexandria, it is developing fast with the emergence of spaces for artists, and support from the public and from abroad. Many Egyptian artists use the Egyptian contemporary art scene as a ramp toward the international.  History  While Egyptian contemporary art has always centered around national political and social aspects, there has clearly been some phases that accentuated other aspects present in Egyptian artists' work.  Pioneer generation and modern art: 1920‚Äì1956  This era was the establishing stage of the contemporary art in Egypt. Most of the intellectual in the first part of the 20th century were going to foreign school, whether located in Egypt or abroad (mostly Europe), and pioneers were routed in a European tradition. While it emerged late, mainly because of the Islamic ban on pictorial art, Egyptian contemporary art strongly focused on the national aspect. Through history, traditions and national culture, contemporary artists were emerging mainly in Cairo and in Alexandria. It is during those decades that Egyptian modern art, institutionalized by the creation of the Prince Youssef Kamel Art School in 1908, began to shift toward a more contemporary composant, giving birth to Egyptian contemporary art. Main artists : * Mohamed Nagi * Mahmoud Mokhtar (1891‚Äì1934) * Ramy Asaad * Ragheb Ayad (1892‚Äì1982)  Nasserism and Egyptian art  This period is characterized by several events. First, the creation of Israel in 1948, followed by the war, has marked the spirits of Egyptians artists. Nasser's accession to the presidency also played a role in the transformation of the contemporary art scene in Egypt. The first consequence is the dissociation from the West for many Egyptian artists. This is caused by the support from the West during the creation of the state of Israel. The contemporary art hence took its influence from the rising Palestinian cause. The presidency of Nasser also had a strong impact. In addition to more and more engaged art, contemporary artists started to express through their work the panarabism Nasser was trying to implement. The main theme of this era was the Arab unity, not only after the Palestinian cause, but also by the expansion of contemporary art through the Arab world. The aspects of contemporary art at this period have shifted from Western influence to common Arab culture. Main artists : * Abdel Hadi Al Gazzar (1925‚Äì1966) * Inji Efflatoun (1924‚Äì1989) * Kamal Amin (1923‚Äì1979)  1970‚Äì2000 : reemergence of Islamic aspects  Anwar Sadat accessed the presidency in 1970, and in order to counteract the nasserists left wing, allowed the coming back of Islamism. At the same period, contemporary art has seen the emergence of Islamic aspects in the works, sometimes even stronger than social and political aspects, through the introduction of calligraphy, or through works depicting Islamic historic events. The regional aspect was also stronger, where regional Arab culture was a source of inspiration for artists. The emergence of Islamic aspects also played a role in reinforcing the pan-arabism feeling. Main artists : * Taha Hussein (1929 - ... ) * Atteya Mostafa The 2000‚Äì2011 era In 1998, the Townhouse Gallery was launched. This marks the beginning of a new era in Egyptian contemporary Art toward the will to democratize the art to any audience. New mediums of art emerging, such as video or installations, and the number of open and free art spaces is rising mainly in Cairo and Alexandria. However, this development of the Egyptian contemporary art is still facing censorship from the government, the lack of funding from official sources, and the influence of foreign curators on the work exposed.  Egyptian arts post-2011 revolution  The 2011 Egyptian revolution and the fall of former Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, ushered a new era of arts that reflects new social and political environment. \\"The revolution triggered a new public culture\\" From the beginning of the revolution, artists played a significant role in the protests. Likewise, many genres of arts emerged such as street art, music and what so called 'electro sha'bi' or 'Techno sha'bi'. Artists used arts to document and capture the essence of the revolution. They also distribute their arts through on- line and social networks. Graffiti and political song are among the most powerful tools in the new public culture.  Graffiti  Graffiti comes from the Greek word \\"Graphien\\", which means \\"to write\\". Graffiti today has been defined as \\"the act of inscribing or drawing on walls for the purpose of communicating a message to the general public\\". In Egypt, graffiti is dating back to the Pharonic period when the Egyptians used to document their daily life on the temple walls. In modern-day Egypt, and during Mubarak era, graffiti was illegal and classified as a \\"misdemeanor\\". Before 2011 revolution, graffiti served as a channel to promote the reclamation of public space, via positive cultural and social exchange. The graffiti were mostly featuring religious, advertisements or romantic declarations, even though a couple of urban artists were already active. The birth of \\"revolutionary graffiti\\" in Egypt took place during the first days of the revolution when Egyptians protesters convey uncensored political messages against Mubarak's regime. Since the toppling of Mubarak, graffiti has become an alternative media channel, documenting different political events that taking place in the country and paying homage to activists who died. Some streets inside and outside Cairo turned into graffiti hubs such as Mohamed Mahmoud Street in Cairo and Al Gomhuria in Assiut. Meanwhile, graffiti reflects the controversial political debate in Egypt post revolution and during Muslim Brotherhood ruling era. On one hand, the streets around Tahrir square have become a graffiti gallery of opposing the current regime of Mohamed Morsi who is accused of failing to reform post- revolution Egypt while consolidating power in the hands of his Muslim Brotherhood. On the other hand, in some districts inside Cairo and Assiut, only pro- Morsi graffiti exist in streets' walls. Egyptian graffiti artists are also raising awareness on socio-political subjects as diverse as corruption, poverty, media brainwashing or sexual harassment. Moreover, they use graffiti as a tool to beautify slum areas in Cairo, restoring a sense of ownership, pride and hope to its residents. Contemporary Egyptian graffiti are complex cultural products of an urban self-aware society that finds itself at a crossroad. The revolution, as Ursula Lindsey points out \\"has accelerated the valorization of Egypt's burgeoning youth culture and its \\"underground\\" and \\"independent\\" artists\\". These artists are committed to freely expressing themselves, engaging in a civic dialog with the society, re-appropriating in this way a public space from which the previous authoritarian regime deprived the Egyptians. The large corpus of graffiti available shows a high incidence of national and gender related imagery highlighting the political and social themes that engage different sides of the Egyptian society. Through graffiti and its predominant imagery we can catch a glimpse of how the Egyptians reconstruct national symbols and how events of the revolution are memorialized not only preventing them from oblivion but transforming them into symbols of national identity. As Susan Philips indicates \\"if graffiti is a window into a culture (...) then it is the same window that people use to look in on themselves as they actively construct the guidelines and concerns of their lives\\". What Cairene graffiti show us is that the Egyptian (post-) revolutionary society valorizes its recent and remote past and cultural heritage to which its identity is tributary. Nonetheless, as witnesses of important social and political change, the walls of Cairo contribute to transforming the actors of the revolution into symbols of cohesion and mobilization while keeping their memory alive and promoting the social and political causes they stand for. =Graffiti artists= * Aya Tarek * Chico * El Teneen * Ganzeer * Keizer *El Zeft Political song and music The purpose of political songs is to move and unify the crowds in a state that 'Durkheim has called \\"collective effervescence\\". Egyptian political song is always playing a crucial role at provoking the public to be politically active. Take the song \\"patriotic Port Said\\" by El Tanbura The song refers to the 1956 Suez war, when Israel, France and Great Britain attacked Egypt after President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal. El Tanbura is a collective of musicians from the city of Port Said on the Suez Canal, formed by Zakariyya Ahmad in 1978. They also performed other nationalist songs in various political and time phases. It is impossible to discuss Egyptian political songs after the 25th of January Revolution without recalling the role played by pioneer musician Sheikh Imam in politics in the 1970s and 1980s. \\"Sheikh Imam is a major pillar of the Arabic political song which motivated thousands of workers and intellectuals rebellious against decadent times and ambitious for better tomorrow.\\" When Sheikh Imam met the poet Ahmed Fouad Negm in 1962, the two formed an influential duo and developed the popular political song. The 1967 War brought the duo to reflect the impact of f Arab defeat in their revolutionary songs Misr Ya Bahia [Pretty Egypt], Shayid Kussurak [Build Your Palaces], Ghifara [Che Ghivara], El Fallahin [the Peasants] and Mur El Kalam [Bitter Talk] \\"The music of Sheikh Imam was marked by a form of totality that made his political song travel beyond the geographical location of its origin.\\" Many other popular Egyptian singers contribute in political song such as Um Kalthoum, Abdel Halim Hafez, and Abdel Wahab who composed \\"Al watan Al Akbar\\" The Greatest Homeland in 1960 and it was produced to celebrate the union of Egypt & Syria into the United Arab Republic. In 2011, Egypt witnesses a new and distinguished wave of political songs, in which unknown young singers and underground bands played a significant role to keep the protesters' spirit high during 18 days revolution. Singers such as Ramy Esam, Amir Eid and Hani Adel, Rami Donjewan and other bands like Eskenderella used to rock Tahrir square with their political lyrics and influential music. These singers continue to tackle Egyptian social and political issues in their songs. Another important and emergent genre of contemporary Egyptian music is Mahragan (ŸÖŸáÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÜ) (\\"festival\\") or Mahraganat (ŸÖŸáÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÜÿßÿ™) (pl. \\"festivals\\"), which originated in working-class neighborhoods and in particular from the ashwa'iyyat (shanty towns) on the peripheries of Cairo and Alexandria. This genre, which started to appear on YouTube in 2007, has gained immense popularity among the youngest generations of Egyptians. Additionally, in the last several years the genre has gained international traction through numerous international tours and various collaborations with European Electronic artists. The music has also been called techno-sha'bi or electro-sha'bi, which refers to the older genre of sha'bi (ÿ¥ÿπÿ®Ÿä) (\\"folk\\") music. However, many Mahragan artists have resisted this designation, as they see their music as something completely new. Some artists, such as Okka and Ortega, have argued that Mahragan is more closely aligned with American Rap/Hip-Hop than with other Egyptian musical forms. Mahragan, usually recorded in makeshift home studios and traded via YouTube and USB sticks, is a mix of either sung (often with auto-tune) or rapped vocals over sampled beats that provide a heavy, energetic, and fast-paced musical soundtrack. Some of the most popular mahragan performers are Figo, Sadat, Alaa' Fifty Cent, DJ Amr Haha (often stylized as 7a7a), Islam Fanta, Weza, Okka and Ortega. Themes Ancient history Artists took their inspiration in Egyptian pharaonic heritage, which is omnipresent in Egypt, through paintings, architecture or sculptures. The main occurring symbol is the pyramid, repeatedly used by artists, as a way of expressing the Egyptian national identity. Mostafa Abdel Moity's work, the Pyramid motif is strongly present in most of his sculptures. He often represents the three Great Pyramids of Gizeh. This is a way a reaffirming the strong influence of Egyptian ancient history. The Nile is also a very recurring aspect of Egyptian culture and beliefs, a sign of fertility, but also in Egyptian contemporary art. Mythological stories from Ancient Egypt often use the Nile as the center of the story, and so do Egyptian contemporary artists. Religion The religious aspect is also repeatedly used in Egyptian contemporary Art either through the form of calligraphy or the description of Islamic events . Classical calligraphy is a source of inspiration for a lot of artworks, and its evolution through the centuries has made it a rich theme in Egyptian contemporary art. In works by Taha Hussein, the aesthetic aspect of the calligraphy is studied by the artist, mostly superposition of letters written in unreadable calligraphy. Women Women are also a frequent theme in Egyptian contemporary art. Inji Efflatoun, in her paintings often depicts women in different positions. This represent the burden Egyptian women are carrying since their birth because of their gender. Injy Efflatoun was well known to be a feminist, fighting for women rights through her work. Gazbia Sirry is another beloved Egyptian artist whose depictions of women made her one of the most pivotal activists for women's rights in the region.

His work has been showcased all over Europe and the United States, as well as in Egypt. He also took part in the Venice Biennale of 2003. One of the main themes tackled in his deliberately provocative work is what constitutes \\"normality\\" and \\"abnormality\\", whether in his installations, photography or performance. His work includes Digital Church (2007), The Cave (2006) and Al Aqsa Park (2006) * Nazir Tanbouli: Born in 1971 in Alexandria into a family of artists (his uncle is painter Ibrahim El Tanbouli and his great-uncle is Lotfy El Tanbouli) Nazir Tanbouli studied at the University of Alexandria for his BFA in Expressive Art, and then at Camberwell College of the University of the Arts London for his MFA. Tanbouli founded the first contemporary mural painting crew in Egypt in the 90s, challenging the older tradition of mural painting (associated with the state) fusing pop art and transnational cultural forms with Egyptian aesthetics. He exhibited in Egypt, Europe and Latin America before moving to the UK. Ignoring trends and fashions Tanbouli has stubbornly stuck to being a painter, and his work continues to explore and transfigure Egyptian motifs in conjunction with current global issues. He works in painting, mural and drawing, producing exhibitions, books and unusual projects. In 2012 he was responsible for the \\"biggest street art project by one artist\\" in the UK. This project is the subject of a documentary 'Taking Over the King's Land', released in 2013. In 2012 Tanbouli won the UAL Creative Enterprise Award  Events, festivals and initiatives  * Artbeat Festival: Founded in 2010, Artbeat is a free 3-day annual festival combining visual art, music and various art workshops by local and international artists.

Many images and structures, belonging to Buddhist and Hindu sects, have been discovered here since 1927. The antiquities found here are dated to 8th to 12th centuries. Sandstone sculptures of the Pilak site, which represent a heterodox culture of Hinduism and Buddhism of 9th to 13th century, are on display at the Tripura Government Museum. Location Pilak site is located at Jolaibari, in South Tripura, and is spread over an area of about . It is away from Agartala, from Udaipur, Santibazar is away, and from Jolaibari. The sites excavated are in Shyam Sundar Tilla, Deb Bari, Thakurani Tilla, Balir Pathar, Basudeb Bari and others. History The archaeological site used to be a part of Samatata kingdom in historical Bengal. It is part of a series of archaeological sites that includes Mainamati and Somapura Mahavihara in Bangladesh. The earliest dates of Hindu and Buddhist sculptures, terracotta plaques and seals found at the site are between 8th and 9th centuries. The artifacts unearthed at the site belong to the Bengal's Palas and Guptas sculptural and architectural features; also the style of the Arakan, Myanmar (earlier known as Burma) and indigenous features is noticeable. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) carried out excavations at the site in early 1960s when stupas built with bricks were found. Recent investigations by ASI was at JolaibƒÅrƒ´ and other mounds where statues of Buddha and idols of Mahayana Buddhism were unearthed. ASI has taken over the site since 1999 and is responsible for its maintenance. Buddhist tourists from Tibet, Southeast Asia and Japan often visit the place. The Dalai Lama of Mahayana Buddhism visited the site (of the Theravada or Hinayana sect) in 2007. Discovery The Pilak archaeological site represents both Hinduism and Buddhism co-existing peacefully. Artifacts of Hinduism are in the form of sculptures and plaques of Hindu gods Shiva, Surya, and Baishnabi. Large number of antiquities pertain to the Hinayana, Mahayana, Vajrayana Buddhism practices. The site is strewn with a large number of terracotta plaques and statues. Very large stone sculptures of Avalokite≈õvara and Narasimha have been unearthed at the site. Buddhist antiquities The inscribed terracotta seals found at Pilak depict the Buddhist stupas of very small sizes. In Tripura, it is the seal which is worshipped and not the stupa. There is a cone shaped stone slab with an image of Buddha in an upright posture, dated to 8th century. In a portion of the image only the right arm is seen while the left hand is holding the border of a vestment. An Ushnisha (a three-dimensional oval form) adorns the top of the head which has a \\"close- curled hair\\" style, and a very small stupa is also engraved on the left part of the slab. A statue of Avalokiteshvara with two arms found at the site is now exhibited in the Tripura Government Museum. A sculpture of the 8th-9th century found here is that of Goddess Marichi, venerated by both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhists. However, it is now an iconic idol which is installed in a Hindu temple known as Vasudev-badi. The idol in an upright posture is called \\"Pratyalida\\" and is mounted on a simple plinth, and is well preserved. The features carved on the idol consist of three faces and six arms; the three right hands depict the \\"sara, vajra, and parashu\\" and the three left hands have depictions of ritual symbols of \\"dhanu, parna-pichichichi and Tarjani mudra\\". A sculpted sandstone statue from the site dated to 8th-9th century is of Chunda which is now revered as \\"Raja Rajeshwari\\" in a temple at Muhuripur. The image is carved with 18 arms in a posture called \\"Vajaparyankasana\\" deified over a \\"padmapitha\\" (lotus pedestal). A dharmachakra symbol of Vajrasattva and Ghanathapani decorate its two regular hands. The sculpting on the top part of this slab also includes five Dhyani Buddhas, each depicting the ring of light around its head. A new find from the Sundari Tilla is of a stupa dated to the 11th century similar to architectural features of the rule of \\"Palas of Bengal\\". Hinduism antiquities A Hindu religious terracotta image made in fired clay found at Pilak is of Trimurti. Another image found here from the Sagardheba mound is of Surya, the Sun god, riding a chariot driven by seven horses, dated to 7th-9th century, which is deified in a temple in the Rajesvari Ashram in Muhuripur.

May and Mairtin Standun bought a small 2 bedroom bungalow. But within a few days, the tiny shop founded in 1946 turned into an all purpose store selling things from groceries, general household goods, clothes, footwear, furniture, ice-cream parlor, bedding and bicycles to cement and other building materials as well as a filling station. Standun, known as the home of the Aran Sweater, has become the destination for both tourists and locals. In 1972 Donal, May and Mairtin‚Äôs son, took over the business. Nowadays, Standun is managed by Cliona Standun, the granddaughter of the founders. Products In the 1960s, Standun set up a factory for Aran sweaters which became the most important aspect of Standun, specially when the tourist industry began to grow in the 1970s. The sweaters were collected from the knitters and brought to the factory for finishing. In 1983 and afterwards, Stand√∫n became a landmark in Connemara for great value knitwear and good quality Irish products. Other Information Standun was recommended in guidebooks such as Frommers.

Private and public ceremonies mark many of the important moments in Benin‚Äôs yearly calendar. In the past, an elaborate series of rites were performed throughout the year to secure otherworldly support for the kingdom‚Äôs well-being and to celebrate decisive events in its history. Pectorals, Hip Ornaments and Waist Pendants Oba and Two Attendants, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum Chiefs and titleholders in Benin wear a variety of brass ornaments as part of their elaborate regalia for palace ceremonies. Most are worn at the left hip, covering the closure of their wrapped skirts. Typically made of brass, they are often worn horizontally and are held in place by large loops located at the top and bottom of the back of the ornament. Pectoral masks depict a human face symmetrically framed by an ornamental flange with loops for small metal rattles, called crotals, at the bottom, below the ears, and by a row of projecting trapezoids at the top, above the ears. The foreheads of pectoral masks are inlaid with iron rectangles, known as ikan aro (\\"cane of eye\\"), which give the face the look of determination, fierceness and power that is appropriate to a ruler. The ornaments that chiefs wear over their left hip most often depict the human face but are different in form from the pectorals. They have a decorative flange around the lower portion of the face, usually representing either coiled mudfish, an openwork lattice or guilloche pattern, or a fluted collar, with a row of small loops directly below or behind it. A collar of coral beads is depicted below the face, and above the face is a latticework coral-beaded cap with clusters of coral beads at the edges. The face has three raised keloid scarification marks (ikharo) above each eye. Some masks are inlaid with a strip of metal down the forehead and/or nose. The most likely explanation for this marking is that it indicates urebo, a protective mixture of herbs and chalk, which was rubbed on the nose and forehead to ward off danger during festivals. Earlier scholarship suggested that sacrificial blood was also in this mixture. Suspension loops at the top indicate that the pendant was worn at the waist. Many Benin pendants incorporated semicircular or shield-shaped fields into their designs. Side- blown Trumpets Side-blown Trumpet, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum Figure of a Hornblower, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum Akohen are large, side-blown trumpets carved of ivory and played by the Oba's retainers when he appears in full ceremonial dress at palace rituals. The akohen glorify the Oba musically with their deep, piercing sounds, and visually, their white ivory signifying the Oba's wealth, strength and purity. According to oral tradition, the akohen were introduced by Oba Eresonyen although other types of side-blown trumpets existed earlier. Brass Vessels and Implements Box in the Form of a Leopards Head, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum A variety of brass vessels were made in Benin, including buckets, bowls, jugs, boxes and aquamaniles in the forms of leopards and rams. Historians credit Oba Ewuare, who reigned in the mid-fifteenth century, with the original acquisition of these containers for use in palace rituals. According to oral traditions, Ewuare obtained the brass vessels, along with coral-bead regalia, from the underwater palace of Olokun, the god of the sea. Called iru, these spiritually charged objects were in use in the shrine of Olokun's father, Osanobua, the creator god. According to the story, Ewuare heard voices within the vessels that repeated \\"ise, ise, ise,\\" a typical ritual response. He brought the vessels back to his own palace, where they were placed on the Benin state shrine, Ebo n'Edo. In Benin today, ritual specialists known as Emuru, who serve the Ebo n-Edo shrine, carry brass vessels with protective substances. The Ebo n'Edo shrine, its spirits, the priests who serve them, and the objects used in their rituals are seen as references to the origin of the dynasty and the authority inherited by the Obas. Benin vessels have a greater significance than their utilitarian function; they refer to the Oba's ancestral authority, to Ewuare, and to the power that stems from the Oba's relationship to Olokun. The leopard is the most common form of zoomorphic aquamanile made in Benin. The leopard, \\"king of the bush,\\" is one of the principal symbols of the Oba in Benin art, expressing his ferocious, aggressive nature. Gongs This double bell (Egogo), now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum, is one of the oldest surviving African ivory sculptures; only six of these ivory gongs are known. Double gongs were used by the oba (king) during the Emobo ceremony to drive away evil spirits. The carving here depicts the oba, supported by his military commander and his heir. Finely carved ivory double gongs are called such because of second, smaller resonating cups at their front. Typically, the central image is the oba in coral regalia supported by the high priests osa and osuan, officials who tend the altars of the kingdom‚Äôs two patron gods. These gongs are still carried today by the oba during Emobo, the last of the empowering rites of the Igue festival. The oba gently taps the ivory instrument, creating a rhythmic sound to calm and dismiss unruly spirits from the kingdom.

Saulespurƒìns also developed the tunable capsule for contemporary microphone design and invented the Champagne Microphone Cable.  Early life and education Saulespurƒìns was born and raised in Rƒ´ga, Latvia. He graduated from Riga Polytechnical Institute (now Riga Technical University) in 1974 with a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering. In 1967, Saulespurƒìns was a drummer in an R&B; band for which he bought a damaged LOMO 19A-19 tube condenser microphone and refurbished it to use for recording. Career Saulespurƒìns worked as an audio engineer for the Latvian Conservatory of Music when he met American session musician, Skipper Wise. In 1995, they created the Blue Microphones company to repair and refurbish vintage microphones for which parts were no longer available. \\"Blue\\" was an acronym for Baltic Latvian Universal Electronics. Under the encouragement of New York City recording studio owner Walter Sear, Saulespurƒìns and Wise developed their own line of microphones. The BLUE microphone was base upon an old RFT Bottle design but without the internal power supply making it a quieter and smoother. MƒÅrti≈Ü≈° Saulespurƒìns with Felix Stanevich in anechoic chamber testing microphones Saulespurƒìns and Wise also built microphones to handle digital processing (extended frequency response, dynamic range, etc.). They used a movable round brass plate instead of a permanent membrane in the rear part of the capsule. This allowed Blue to move the plate to change the volume of the air inside, changing the frequency response. The first microphone they created was the Blueberry. The replacement of rear Mylar film membranes with solid tuned brass pieces became standard industry practice. Saulespurƒìns, in collaboration with Blue, developed the first microphone cable to pass both power and the audio signal in a single cable without extensive audio signal degradation. To eliminate the need for two cable connections in a tube microphone ‚Äì power supply and audio signal ‚Äì he combined two pairs of conductors twisted to eliminate noise and then covered with a fine-tinned copper braid for additional protection. After receiving an early copy of GarageBand recording software from Apple Computers, Saulespurƒìns and Wise developed a microphone that connected directly to a computer through the USB port. Although there were other USB microphones in production, the BLUE company's Snowball microphone was the first directed at professional sound recording. In 2005, Apple decided to stock the Snowball with its store products which dramatically boosted the popularity of Blue Microphones. Saulespurƒìns and Wise sold their company to Transom Capital Group in 2008.

City of Westminster ([2001] UKHL 55) is an English court ruling on nuisance, addressing the question of liability for repairing damage caused by tree roots. The court upheld a ruling of the Court of Appeal, stating that if a defendant knew about a continuing nuisance (in this case, cracking caused by tree roots), and had been given notice and opportunity to deal with it but failed to do so, then a claimant was entitled to receive costs for removing the nuisance themselves. It is a leading case, and has not been superseded or overturned by subsequent judgements. Delaware was the last case in which Lord Cooke of Thorndon sat as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. He was joined by Lord Steyn, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, and Lord Hutton. Background The freehold owners of the Delaware Mansions, a block of flats in Delaware Road, Maida Vale (at ), had received complaints of cracking in the building in 1989. An engineer's inspection that winter concluded that this was due to the roots of a large London plane tree outside the building, and recommended it be removed; if it could not be removed, then the foundations would need underpinning. A second report a year later made the same conclusions, with more urgency.[2001] UKHL 55, para 6-8 Eventually, in October 1991, Westminster Council - the owners of the tree - cut back the roots, and through January‚ÄìJuly 1992 Flecksun - the freeholders - carried out a program of structural underpinning to stabilise the building.[2001] UKHL 55, para 9-10 The total costs to Flecksun came to just over ¬£570,000, and they sued Westminster, as owners of the tree, for compensation.[2001] UKHL 55, para 3-4, 9-10 The issue was complicated by the fact that, until June 1990 - just before Westminster was first notified of the damage - the freehold to the estate was owned by the Church Commissioners; the sale did not contain any mention of the right to legal action for nuisances.[2001] UKHL 55, para 5 Westminster contended that if they were liable, then Flecksun could only sue for \\"fresh\\" damages caused by the tree after the transfer; only the Commissioners could sue for the existing damage.[2001] UKHL 55, para 11 The case was initially heard by the Official Referees' Court, where Recorder Derek Wood QC dismissed Flecksun's claim (as well as that of Delaware Holdings, their parent company). Flecksun took the case to the Court of Appeal, where a panel of judges (Beldam, Pill, and Thorpe) granted the appeal, allowing Flecksun to claim the ¬£570,000 damages along with a further ¬£265,000 in interest. Westminster appealed, sending the case to the House of Lords.[2001] UKHL 55, para 3-4 The case has been discussed extensively by Jason W.

Rex Smith, \\"Politische Geschichte des islamischen Jemen bis zur ersten t√ºrkischen Invasion\\" in Werner Daum, Jemen, Frankfurt am Main, p. 137. The name of the family is often incorrectly rendered as \\"Yafurids\\". They nominally acknowledged the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliphs. Their centres were San'a and Shibam Kawkaban. The Yu øfirids followed Sunni Islam. Rise of the dynasty At the time when the direct rule of the Abbasids over Yemen declined, the Yu øfirids from Shibam Kawkaban began to expand their power base in the Yemeni highland. They are descended from DÃ≤hÃ≤≈´ ·∏§iwƒÅl tribe, which is a tribe from Shibam Kawkaban. The first attack on San'a in 841 failed miserably and the Abbasid governor received troops from Iraq for assistance. Nevertheless, the Yu øfirids were able to successfully repel the counterattacks against their stronghold in Shibam. In 847 they conquered the area between Sa'dah and Ta'izz. San'a fell to their arms when the governor Himyar ibn al-Harith fled from Yemen. It became the headquarters of the new dynasty for a while.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City, London 1983, p. 55. Internal feuds and temporary eclipse After a stable reign of 25 years the founder of the dynasty, Yu'fir bin  øAbd ar-Ra·∏•mƒÅn al-·∏§iwƒÅlƒ´ al-·∏§imyƒÅrƒ´ left the affairs of the state to his son Muhammad in 872. Muhammad preferred to use Shibam as the capital of his kingdom, rather than San'a. In 873 he received a diploma of confirmation from the Abbasid caliph.G. Rex Smith, \\"Politische Geschichte des islamischen Jemen bis zur ersten t√ºrkischen Invasion\\" in Werner Daum, Jemen, Frankfurt am Main, p. 138. Muhammad ruled over Sa'na, Janad and Hadramawt but paid formal deference to the Ziyadid dynasty in the Tihama lowland. A flood that inundated San'a in 876 served as the motive for Muhammad to undertake the pilgrimage to Mecca and henceforth devote his time to religion. The reins of government were given to his son Ibrahim who murdered his father and uncle in the mosque of Shibam in 892 (or 882) to ensure that there would be no pretensions of power from that direction. The instigator of the murders was none but his own grandfather, the ex-ruler Yu'fir. Now, however, a series of revolts led to the expulsion of the Yu øfirids from San'a. An Abbasid governor took charge of the city for a while, but after 895 conditions turned increasingly chaotic. Competition for San'a At the beginning of the tenth century there were struggles between the followers of the Zaydiyyah brand of Islam and other polities of the Yemeni highlands. The first Zaydi imam al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya temporarily took over San'a in 901 but was later forced to leave the city. In the same period Ibn Haushab and Ali bin al-Fadl al-Jayshani disseminated the creed of the Fatimids among the highland tribes and acquired a great following. The two leaders are usually referred to as Qarmatians although they were actually appointed as da'is (leaders) by the Fatimid ruler.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City, London 1983, p. 56. They were able to conquer San'a in 905, and limit the kingdom of the Yu øfirids to Shibam Kawkaban. For long periods the Yufirid ruler Ab≈´ ·∏§assƒÅn As øad bin IbrƒÅhƒ´m had to stay in the Jawf region further to the north. San'a shifted hands with great frequency in this period; from 901 to 913 the city is said to have been conquered 20 times, surrendered through negotiation three times, and been unsuccessfully besieged five times.Enzyklop√§die des Islam, Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 155. Eventually the dynasty managed to defeat the followers of the Fatimids and win back San'a in 916. Later history Ab≈´ ·∏§assƒÅn As øad died in 944 and was, as it turned out, the last grand Yufirid leader. In the middle of the tenth century the decline of the dynasty set in as the members of the family feuded with each other. The Zaydi imam al-Mukhtar al-Qasim managed to acquire San'a in 956 but was murdered in the same year by a Hamdan chief called Ibn al-Dahhak who dominated politics until 963 and acknowledged the Ziyadids in Zabid. Next, a chief from Khawlan called al-Asmar Yusuf set up the prince Abdallah bin Qahtan on the throne. Abdallah had a long and turbulent reign and successfully attacked the Ziyadids in 989, investing and plundering Zabid. He then stopped mentioning the Abbasids in the khutba and instead adhered to the Egyptian Fatimid caliph. Abdallah died in 997 and was succeeded by his son As'ad (II).

She was built in Belfast, Ireland in 1905 and was the first of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's fleet of \\"A-liners\\" that worked regular routes between Southampton and South American ports including Buenos Aires. In 1913 Aragon became Britain's first defensively armed merchant ship (\\"DAMS\\") of modern times. In the First World War she served as a troop ship, taking part in the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915. In 1917 a German submarine sank her in the Mediterranean, killing 610 of the personnel aboard. Building Owen Philipps became chairman of RMSP in 1903 and quickly addressed the company's need for larger ships on its South America route. RMSP ordered Aragon from Harland and Wolff built in Belfast, where she was launched on 23 February 1905 by the Countess Fitzwilliam. He discussed with Charles Parsons the possibility of steam turbine propulsion, which had been demonstrated by the steam launch Turbinia in 1894. The first turbine- powered passenger ship, , had entered service on the Firth of Clyde in 1901 but Philipps decided that another year of evaluation was needed to establish if and how to apply the new form of steam power to commercial ships. Accordingly, Aragon was built with a pair of conventional quadruple-expansion steam engines that between them developed 827 or 875 NHP. They drove twin screws that gave her a speed of . She had a single large funnel amidships. She had 12 lifeboats on her boat deck plus a dinghy and a gig aft. Her 1st class dining saloon had a panelled ceiling inlaid with paintings of Christopher Columbus discovering the Americas. Aragon had five cargo holds, some of which were refrigerated to carry meat and fruit from South America. Number 5 hold and the lower levels of numbers 1 and 2 holds were for frozen cargos. The 'tween decks of numbers 1 and 2 holds and upper 'tween deck of number 5 hold were for chilled cargos. A steam-powered refrigerating plant used \\"carbonic anhydride\\" as the refrigerant, and the holds were insulated with \\"silicate cotton\\". Her bunkers held 2,000 tons of coal and she had water tanks with a capacity of about 2,000 tons. A-series development Aragon was followed by series of generally similar but progressively larger and heavier liners. In 1906 Harland and Wolff built sister ships and , while another Belfast shipyard, Workman, Clark and Company, built . Harland and Wolff added a fifth sister ship, , in 1908. RMSP gave each of this series a name beginning with \\"A\\", with the result that colloquially they were dubbed the \\"A-series\\" or \\"A-liners\\". A few years later the final four A-series ships followed from Harland and Wolff: in 1912, Andes and in 1913 and in 1915. Apart from being larger again, they differed from Aragon and her first four sisters by having three screws instead of two, and by making limited use of the turbine propulsion that Phillips and Parsons had discussed a few years earlier. Their two outer screws were driven by conventional triple-expansion steam engines. A low-pressure steam turbine drove the middle screw via reduction gearing. Civilian service From the 1850s RMSP passenger liners had served a regular route between Britain and the River Plate ports in South America. They sailed from Southampton in southern England, called at the islands of Madeira and Tenerife off the West African coast; at Pernambuco, Salvador de Bahia and Rio de Janeiro on the coast of Brazil; and then at Montevideo in Uruguay before completing their voyage at Buenos Aires in Argentina. Aragon and her sisters modernised RMSP's Southampton ‚Äì River Plate service, replacing vessels such as RMS Atranto that had been in service from 1889 onwards. The A-series ships hugely increased the profitability of the route. In 1906 she made four voyages to and from South America and netted a total profit of ¬£45,368. In 1908 she ran aground off the Isle of Wight, but that aside her civilian service was generally uneventful. Defensively armed merchant ship From the turn of the 20th century, growing tensions between Europe's Great Powers included an Anglo-German naval arms race that threatened the security of merchant shipping. From 1911 the British Intelligence became aware that the German Empire was secretly arming some of its passenger liners, and the British Government and Admiralty discussed how to respond. Towards the end of 1912 the Admiralty decided to match the German policy by arming some British passenger liners, starting with RMS Aragon. She was due to carry naval guns from December 1912, but within the British Government and Admiralty there was uncertainty as to how foreign countries and ports would react. In January 1913 Rear Admiral Henry Campbell recommended that the Admiralty should send a merchant ship to sea with naval guns, but without ammunition, to test foreign governments' reaction. A meeting chaired by Sir Francis Hopwood, Civil Lord of the Admiralty agreed, and Sir Eyre Crowe recorded \\"If nothing happens, it may be possible and easy, after a time, to place ammunition on board.\\" On 25 April 1913 Aragon left Southampton as Britain's first defensively armed merchant ship (DAMS), carrying two QF naval guns on her stern. Governments, newspapers and the public in South American countries that Aragon visited took little notice and expressed no concern. There was criticism from some serving and retired naval figures in Britain but the policy continued. Aragons sister ship RMS Amazon was made the next DAMS, and in the following months further RMSP \\"A-liners\\" were armed. They included the newly built , which in the First World War served as an armed merchant cruiser. Gallipoli During the First World War the ship was requisitioned as a troop ship and became HMT Aragon. She took part in the Gallipoli Campaign, in which one source states that she began by taking the 5th Battalion, the Hampshire Regiment and Royal Army Medical Corps units to the campaign in March 1915. As the landings were not until 25 April, this may refer to troops moving from the UK to the Eastern Mediterranean in preparation for the landings. Her duties included evacuating nearly 1,500 wounded personnel to Alexandria and Malta. On 8 April Aragon was in Alexandria where she embarked the 4th Battalion, the Worcestershire Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, the Hampshire Regiment. Both battalions were units of the 88th Brigade, which as part of the 29th Division had been ordered to take part in the Gallipoli Landings. On 11 April she left Alexandria for the Aegean island of Lemnos, where French and British ships were assembling in the large natural harbour of Moudros in final preparation for the landings. On 13 April 1915 Aragons troops transferred to the cargo steamer in preparation for the landing at Cape Helles 10 days later. Later in the Gallipoli Campaign a British Forces Post Office, Base Army Post Office Y, transferred from , another troop ship, to Aragon. BAPO Y later redeployed from Aragon to a land base at Moudros. The invasion was a costly failure and in January 1916 French and British forces withdrew from the Gallipoli peninsula. On 13 February Aragon left Moudros for Malta, taking troops on leave including four officers and 270 men of the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division (RND). On 14 May Aragon was again at Moudros to withdraw troops; this time including the 1st Battalion the Royal Marines and elements of the 2nd (Royal Naval) Brigade. She reached Marseille in southern France at 0630 hrs on 19 May. Later in 1916 Aragon served in the Indian Ocean. In December 1916 she sailed from Kilindini Harbour in the British East Africa Protectorate, reaching Durban on Christmas Day. Alexandria Roads Late in 1917 Aragon spent two weeks at anchor off Marseille before receiving orders in December to sail for Egypt. She took about 2,200 troops to reinforce the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the Palestine Campaign against the Ottoman Empire, plus about 150 military officers, 160 VADs and about 2,500 bags of Christmas mail. She and another transport, the Nile, then sailed in convoy with an escort of destroyers for Egypt. On 23 December they reached Windy Bay, Malta, where the two transports stayed at anchor for four or five days. There they celebrated Christmas, and according to one VAD those aboard Aragon had a \\"top hole\\" time. Aragon and Nile then continued to Egypt with a fresh escort: the plus two Imperial Japanese Navy destroyers. The convoy weathered a gale, and off the Egyptian coast at daybreak on Sunday 30 December it divided. The two Japanese destroyers escorted Nile to Port Said, while Attack escorted Aragon to Alexandria. On approach to the port Attack zig-zagged ahead to search the channel for mines while Aragon waited in Alexandria Roads. The armed trawler approached Aragon flying the international flag signal \\"Follow me\\". The troop ship did so, until Attack returned and signalled \\"You have no right to take orders from a trawler\\". The destroyer intercepted Points Castle and then ordered Aragon to return to sea. The troop ship obeyed and turned back to sea. The most senior of Aragons officers to survive what followed tried to make sense of the confusion: > \\"The only explanation that the writer can put forward is that the commander > of the Attack had a warning of mines in the channel, causing him to order > Aragon to disregard Points Castles \\"Follow me\\". Evidently the enemy laid > mines at the appropriate time in the knowledge that the ship would be kept > out and thus present a target for torpedo attack.\\" Aragon and Attack were in Alexandria Roads about or outside the port, awaiting permission to enter, when at about 1100 hrs the German Type UC II submarine torpedoed Aragon, hitting her port side aft and causing extensive damage in her almost empty number 4 hold. Aragons deck officer of the watch, Lieut. J.F.A. Thompson, stated that she then listed to starboard. Rescue Attack and Points Castle came to the rescue. One account states that two trawlers were present. The VADs were ordered into the first lifeboats to be launched. Two or three of the VADs protested at being given priority and one pleaded \\"Let us take our chance with the Tommies\\" before they all obeyed orders. The VADs' boats rescued some troops from the water and then transferred their survivors to one or two trawlers. Aragon released her life rafts but the explosion had smashed one of her lifeboats and her increasing list prevented her crew from launching some of the remainder. Aragons crew worked until they were waist deep in water to launch what boats they could. Attack drew right alongside Aragon to take survivors aboard as quickly as possible, helped by lines cast between the two ships. The troop ship sank rapidly by the stern. More than one survivor stated that soldiers waiting on deck to be rescued started singing. One said \\"I have heard the chorus 'Keep the Home Fires Burning' on many occasions but I don't think that I have ever heard it given with so much power\\". By now there was an increasing number of men in the water, and trooper James Werner Magnusson of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles saw an injured soldier struggling in the very rough sea. He dived overboard from the ship, rescued the man and placed him in a boat. Magnusson then returned aboard, rejoined his unit, and went down with the ship. He was posthumously awarded the Albert Medal. About 15 minutes after the torpedo struck Aragon, her Master, Captain Bateman, gave the order from her bridge \\"Every man for himself\\". Those remaining aboard rushed to get over her side, and her bow rose out of the sea as soldiers swarmed down her side into the water. One of the VADs who survived later recorded \\"We felt that all our friends were drowning before our eyes\\". About 17 to 20 minutes after being hit Aragon went down, and she suffered a second explosion as the cold seawater reached her hot boilers. Some of her boats were left upturned in the water. Cigarette card portrait of BSM Ernest Horlock VC, who was among the hundreds of troops killed when Aragon was sunk Attack was now crowded with 300 to 400 survivors: some naked, some wounded, many unconscious and dying. One soldier, Sergeant Harold Riddlesworth of the Cheshire Regiment, repeatedly dived from the destroyer into the sea to rescue more survivors. He survived and was decorated with the Meritorious Service Medal. HMS Attack sinking Then a torpedo struck Attack amidships and blew her into two pieces, both of which sank with five to seven minutes. The explosion ruptured Attacks bunkers, spilling tons of thick, black bunker fuel oil into the sea as she sank. Hundreds of men were in the water, and many of them became covered in oil or overcome by its fumes. Aragons surviving lifeboats now ferried hundreds of survivors to the trawlers, where the VADs \\"worked unceasingly and with great heroism\\" to tend the many wounded. Other trawlers came out to assist, and the first trawler or trawlers returned to harbour for safety. Deaths and survivors Of those aboard Aragon, 610 were killed including Captain Bateman, 19 of his crew, and six of the VADs. Hundreds of troops were killed. One was Ernest Horlock, a Royal Field Artillery Battery Sergeant Major who had received the VC for \\"conspicuous gallantry\\" shown on the Western Front in 1914. Another 25 of those killed were new recruits to the 5th Battalion the Bedfordshire Regiment. Soldiers killed in the sinking are among those commemorated by the Chatby Memorial in the Shatby district of eastern Alexandria. Aragons second officer was among the survivors. A month later he told the Master of an Australian troopship, the converted AUSNC liner HMAT Indarra, that as Aragon sank Captain Bateman shouted from her bridge to Attacks commander that he would demand an enquiry into his ship having been ordered out of port. Bateman then jumped overboard and was not seen again. Many of the survivors from Aragons crew were repatriated to England, reaching Southampton on 10 February 1918. Some voyaged all the way by steamship, but the majority travelled overland. Wreck Aragon remains a wreck off the Egyptian coast, lying in about of water.

The International Affective Picture System (IAPS) in the study of emotion and attention. In J. A. Coan and J. J. B. Allen (Eds.), Handbook of Emotion Elicitation and Assessment (pp. 29-46). Oxford University Press The IAPS was developed by the National Institute of Mental Health Center for Emotion and Attention at the University of Florida. In 2005, the IAPS comprised 956 color photographs ranging from everyday objects and scenes ‚àí such as household furniture and landscapes ‚àí to extremely rare or exciting scenes ‚àí such as mutilated bodies and erotic nudes. Normative Ratings It is the essential property of the IAPS that the stimulus set is accompanied by a detailed list of average ratings of the emotions elicited by each picture. This shall enable other researcher to select stimuli eliciting a specific range of emotions for their experiments when using the IAPS. The process of establishing such average ratings for a stimulus set is also referred to as standardization by psychologists. The normative rating procedure for the IAPS is based on the assumption that emotional assessments can be accounted for by the three dimensions valence, arousal and dominance. Thus, participants taking part in the studies that are conducted to standardize the IAPS are asked to rate how pleasant/unpleasant, how calm/excited and how controlled/in-control they felt when looking at each picture. A graphic rating scale, the Self- Assessment Manikin (SAM),Lang, P. J., Bradley, M. M., and Cuthbert, B. N. (1997). International affective picture system (IAPS): Technical manual and affective ratings. is used for this rating procedure. Original norms The official normative ratings for the IAPS pictures were obtained from a sample of 100 college students (50 women, 50 men, presumably predominantly US- American) who each rated 16 sets of 60 pictures. The rating was carried out in groups using paper-and-pencil versions of the SAMs. Pictures were presented for 6 seconds each; 15 seconds were given to rate the picture. /dominance. Average valence, arousal and dominance ratings are available for the overall sample, men, and women. Normative ratings were also obtained from children ages 7‚Äì9 years, 10-12, and 13-14. The rating procedure for children was mildly adapted; among other modifications, children were tested in classrooms, given instructions in a more child-friendly language, and they were allotted 20 seconds to rate each picture instead of 15. Norms from further studies Researchers from other institutes than the National Institute of Mental Health have also conducted studies to establish normative ratings for the IAPS in other than the US-American culture or the other than the English language, i.e. Hungarian, German, Portuguese, Indian, and Spanish One of these studies also included older participants (63‚Äì77 years). Use of the IAPS pictures IAPS pictures have been used in studies using a variety of psychophysiological measurements such as fMRI, EEG, magnetoencephalography, skin conductance, heart rate, and electromyography. The IAPS has also been used in the psychology laboratory to experimentally manipulate anxiety and induce negative affect, enabling researchers to investigate the impacts of negative affect on cognitive performance. Access To maintain novelty and efficacy of the stimulus set, the IAPS images themselves are typically not shown in any media outlet or publications. The IAPS may be received and used upon request by members of recognized, degree-granting, academic, not-for-profit research or educational institutions.  Alternatives  Image sets A group of researchers at Harvard University has published an alternative set of images that they claim to be comparable to the IAPS in 2016. The OASIS image database consists of 900 images that have been rated on valence and arousal by a sample of US-Americans recruited via amazon mechanical Turk. As opposed to the IAPS, all OASIS images are in the public domain. A detailed description is provided on the first author's homepage. Other alternative databases of photographic images of scenes with various kinds of affective content include: * Besan√ßon Affective Picture Set-adult (BAPS-Adult) * Categorized Affective Pictures Database (CAP-D) * Complex Affective Scene Set (COMPASS) * DIsgust-RelaTed- Images (DIRTI) database * EmoMadrid * Geneva Affective Picture Database (GAPED) * Image Stimuli for Emotion Elicitation (ISEE) * Natural Disasters Picture System (NDPS) * Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS) * Set of Fear Inducing Pictures (SFIP) * Socio-Moral Image Database (SMID) Other mediums The authors of the IAPS have developed a number of non-image alternatives for eliciting emotion such as the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) and International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS).

Biography   Early life  Dalia Shusterman was born December 25, 1973 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to a French Modern Orthodox Jewish family. She grew up in Potomac, Maryland. She played piano as a child, but discovered her talent for drums at an Earth First New Year's Eve party when she was 16, after playing the hired band's hand drums while they were on break and getting a positive response from the people in attendance. Inspired by this, she soon started busking in Washington, and then after hitchhiking across the country, in New Orleans. The street playing there got her access to several local stages, Mardi Gras parades, and even onstage at the New Orleans Jazz Festival. Shusterman briefly attended the State University of New York at Purchase, where she studied philosophy and literature. While still an undergraduate, a friend convinced her to play a full-on drum kit in the opening act for the band Boss Hog.  Hopewell  In 1993, Shusterman and bassist Jason \\"Whip\\" Merrit joined brothers Jason and Justin Russo of Mercury Rev to form the psychedelic rock band Hopewell. The group recorded a series of 7\\" singles before releasing their 1998 debut album Contact on Burnt Hair Records. The record was promoted by a small string of shows until the band went on hiatus, during which time the Russos toured with Mercury Rev and Merrit recorded a solo album, Song Song. The band regrouped in 1999 to record their second album, The Curved Glass, which was released in October 2000 by Priapus Records. The album received critical acclaim and was promoted by a performance at the English Reading and Leeds Festivals, as well as an extensive European tour.  Return to Judaism and retirement  In September 2001, Shusterman, while in Manhattan, received a flyer for a Sukkot event in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn and decided to attend. Her experience there motivated her to join Chabad, marry a young Hasidic rabbi she had met at the event, and quit Hopewell. She subsequently moved with her new husband to Los Angeles, where their four sons were born.  Bulletproof Stockings  After her husband's death in the spring of 2011, Shusterman and her children moved back to New York. There, a friend introduced her to Perl Wolfe, a singer-songwriter and fellow Lubavitcher, and the two formed the all-female Hasidic alternative rock group Bulletproof Stockings in December of that year. The group released their debut EP, Down to the Top, on April 1, 2012. The quartet Bulletproof Stockings (Wolfe, Shusterman, Elisheva Maister, and Dana Pestun) toured throughout New York and Los Angeles with plans to expand their lineup and release a full-length album. On April 8, 2016, Shusterman announced that Bulletproof Stockings had disbanded and that the four band members were heading off to individual music pursuits.  New Moon All Stars Party Band  In 2017, Shusterman and former Bulletproof Stockings bandmate Dana Pestun debuted a new Hasidic all-female jazz/klezmer/cabaret group, The New Moon All Stars Party Band.

Although not formally counted as one of the State Department's \\"China Hands\\", he was a U.S. Foreign Service Officer in Peiping and Nanjing prior to the war, and served in multiple U.S. government and policy advisory positions covering East Asia for almost seven decades. As an academic, he taught at the University of Southern California, Stanford University, and the Naval Postgraduate School. Buss authored multiple texts which became standard reference works in the field of East Asian studies, and influenced generations of American civilian and military leaders and policy makers working in and around East Asia. Early life Buss was born in Sunbury, Pennsylvania on November 29, 1903. He received a B.A. from Washington Missionary College in 1922, an M.A. from Susquehanna University in 1924, and a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1927. Service in China After continuing his studies at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, he became a U.S. Foreign Service officer, serving in the U.S. legation in Beijing from 1927 to 1928 and as vice-consul in Nanjing from 1931 to 1934. That same year, he went on to join the faculty of the University of Southern California, where he lectured until 1941. World War II Shortly before Pearl Harbor in 1941, Buss left USC to become executive assistant to the U.S. High Commissioner in the Philippines, who at this time was Francis Bowes Sayre, Sr.. As the ranking U.S. State Department official left behind when the Japanese invaded, Buss surrendered Manila to the Japanese on January 2, 1942. He was held with other Americans in a private home until June 1942, and was then transferred to Tokyo, where he was held until his repatriation aboard the MS Gripsholm as part of a prisoner exchange in November 1943. After repatriation, he directed the San Francisco Office of War Information for a year. In 1945-46, he also served as a consultant to the War Department's Strategic Bombing Survey of Japan. Academic career In 1946, he joined Stanford's history faculty teaching courses on Southeast Asia, China, and American policies toward Asia, a post he would keep for twenty three years. During this time, he also served as a civilian consultant in the information and education segment of General MacArthur's staff for the Allied occupation of Japan. He would later serve as a special Southeast Asia consultant to the U.S. Embassy in Japan from 1948 to 1949. On a parallel track with his academic career, Professor Buss seized every opportunity to share his knowledge of world affairs with domestic civilian audiences. From church groups to professional associations, he enthusiastically presented up-to-the-minute talks, each carefully logged in a binder kept in his study. Eventually this skill brought him to the attention of the State Department's programs for promoting international understanding through speaking tours and scholarly exchanges. This allowed him to visit Asia at least once every year until his 92nd year, meeting scholars around the Pacific Rim and offering, in return for their views, his own. In 1957 and 1959, Buss was named a Fulbright exchange professor at the University of the Philippines, and was named a Carnegie teaching fellow in international law. A former director of studies at the National War College in Washington, D.C., Buss was also named to a panel of advisers to the State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. In 1968 he received a State Department \\"scroll of honor\\" recognizing \\"devoted service to the cause of Philippine-American friendship and understanding for more than a quarter of a century.\\" After his retirement from Stanford University, Claude Buss was named in 1977 acting dean of academic affairs at the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies and as an instructor in Asian studies. He also taught on an occasional basis at C.S.U. San Jose. In a final contribution to the academic study of Asia, he taught at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey California, where he conveyed a lifetime of experience to many military officers from all the US services. He continued to travel regularly to the Philippines and to other parts of Asia, where he was received by influential political, educational, and cultural leaders. Death Claude Buss remained physically and mentally in good health for most of his life until he suffered a stroke at the age of 93. He died in his home in Palo Alto, California on November 17, 1998. Pre-deceased by his wife and younger daughter, he was survived by his older daughter and her husband, four grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

Their bulk motions in the local standard of rest have velocities which are measured in excess of 70‚Äì90 km s‚àí1. These clouds of gas can be massive in size, some on the order of millions of times the mass of the Sun (\\\\begin{smallmatrix}M_\\\\odot\\\\end{smallmatrix}), and cover large portions of the sky. They have been observed in the Milky Way's halo and within other nearby galaxies. HVCs are important to the understanding of galactic evolution because they account for a large amount of baryonic matter in the galactic halo. In addition, as these clouds fall into the disk of the galaxy, they add material that can form stars in addition to the dilute star forming material already present in the disk. This new material aids in maintaining the star formation rate (SFR) of the galaxy. The origins of the HVCs are still in question. No one theory explains all of the HVCs in the galaxy. However, it is known that some HVCs are probably spawned by interactions between the Milky Way and satellite galaxies, such as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) which produce a well- known complex of HVCs called the Magellanic Stream. Because of the various possible mechanisms that could potentially produce HVCs, there are still many questions surrounding HVCs for researchers to study. Observational history The Milky Way arch emerging from the Cerro Paranal, Chile in December 2009. In the mid-1950s, dense pockets of gas were first discovered outside of the galactic plane. This was quite notable because the models of the Milky Way showed the density of gas decreasing with distance from the galactic plane, rendering this a striking exception. According to the prevailing galactic models, the dense pockets should have dissipated long ago, making their very existence in the halo quite puzzling. In 1956 the solution was proposed that the dense pockets were stabilized by a hot, gaseous corona that surrounds the Milky Way. Inspired by this proposal, Jan Oort, of Leiden University, Netherlands, proposed that cold gas clouds might be found in the galactic halo, far away from the galactic plane. They were soon located, in 1963, via their neutral hydrogen radio emission. They were traveling toward the galactic disk at a very high velocity relative to other entities in the galactic disk. The first two clouds that were located were named Complex A and Complex C. Due to their anomalous velocities, these objects were dubbed \\"high-velocity clouds\\", distinguishing them from both gas at normal local standard of rest velocities as well as their slower-moving counterparts known as intermediate- velocity clouds (IVCs). Several astronomers proposed hypotheses (which later proved to be inaccurate) regarding the nature of HVCs, but their models were further complicated in the early 1970s by the discovery of the Magellanic Stream, which behaves like a string of HVCs. In 1988, a northern-sky survey of neutral hydrogen radio emissions was completed using the Dwingeloo radio telescope in the Netherlands. From this survey, astronomers were able to detect more HVCs. In 1997, a map of the Milky Way's neutral hydrogen was largely complete, again allowing astronomers to detect more HVCs. In the late 1990s, using data from the La Palma Observatory in the Canary Islands, the Hubble Space Telescope, and, later, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), the distance to an HVC was gauged for the first time. Around the same time, the chemical composition of HVCs was first measured. Additionally, in 2000, a southern hemisphere survey of neutral hydrogen radio emissions was completed using the Villa Elisa radio telescope in Argentina from which yet more HVCs were discovered. Later observations of Complex C showed that the cloud, originally thought to be deficient in heavy elements (also known as low metallicity), contains some sections with a higher metallicity compared to the bulk of the cloud, indicating that it has begun to mix with other gas in the halo. Using observations of highly ionized oxygen and other ions astronomers were able to show that hot gas in Complex C is an interface between hot and cold gas. Characteristics  Multi-phase structure  HVCs are typically the coldest and densest components of the galactic halo. However, the halo itself also has a multi-phase structure: cold and dense neutral hydrogen at temperatures less than 104 K, warm and warm-hot gas at temperatures between 104 K and 106 K, and hot ionized gas at temperatures greater than 106 K. As a result, cool clouds moving through the diffuse halo medium have a chance to become ionized by the warmer and hotter gas. This can create a pocket of ionized gas that surrounds a neutral interior in an HVC. Evidence of this cool-hot gas interaction in the halo comes from the observation of OVI absorption.  Distance  HVCs are defined by their respective velocities, but distance measurements allow for estimates on their size, mass, volume density, and even pressure. In the Milky Way, clouds are typically located between 2‚Äì15 kpc (6.52x103 ly‚Äì4.89x104 ly), and at z-heights (distances above or below the Galactic plane) within 10 kpc (3.26x104 ly). The Magellanic Stream and the Leading Arm are at ~55 kpc (1.79x105 ly), near the Magellanic Clouds, and may extend to about 100‚Äì150 kpc (3.26x105 ly‚Äì4.89x105 ly). There are two methods of distance determination for HVCs. = Direct-distance constraint = The best method for determining the distance to an HVC involves using a halo star of known distance as a standard for comparison. We can extract information about the distance by studying the star's spectrum. If a cloud is located in front of the halo star, absorption lines will be present, whereas if the cloud is behind the star, no absorption lines should be present. CaII, H, K, and/or NaII are the double absorption lines that are used in this technique. Halo stars that have been identified through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have led to distance measurements for almost all of the large complexes currently known. = Indirect-distance constraint = The indirect-distance-constraint methods are usually dependent on theoretical models, and assumptions must be made in order for them to work. One indirect method involves HŒ± observations, where an assumption is made that the emission lines come from ionizing radiation from the galaxy, reaching the cloud's surface. Another method uses deep HI observations in the Milky Way and/or Local Group with the assumption that the distribution of HVCs in the Local Group is similar to that of the Milky Way. These observations put the clouds within 80 kpc (2.61x105 ly) of the galaxy, and observations of the Andromeda Galaxy put them at approximately 50 kpc (1.63x105 ly). For those HVCs where both are available, distances measured via HŒ± emission tend to agree with those found via direct distances measurements.  Spectral features  HVCs are typically detected at the radio and optical wavelengths, and for hotter HVCs, ultraviolet and/or X-ray observations are needed. Neutral hydrogen clouds are detected via the 21 cm emission line. Observations have shown that HVCs can have ionized exteriors due to external radiation or the motion of the HVC through a diffuse halo medium. These ionized components can be detected through HŒ± emission lines and even absorption lines in the ultraviolet. The warm-hot gas in HVCs exhibit OVI, SiIV, and CIV absorption lines. Temperature Most HVCs show spectral line widths that are indicative of a warm, neutral medium for HVCs at about 9000 Kelvin. However, many HVCs have line widths which indicate that they are also partly composed of cool gas at less than 500 K. Mass Estimates on the peak column density of HVCs (1019 cm‚àí2) and typical distances (1‚Äì15 kpc) yield a mass estimate of HVCs in the Milky Way in the range of 7.4x107 \\\\begin{smallmatrix}M_\\\\odot\\\\end{smallmatrix}. If the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud are included, the total mass would increase by another 7x108 \\\\begin{smallmatrix}M_\\\\odot\\\\end{smallmatrix}. Size Observed angular sizes for HVCs range from 103 degrees2 down to the resolution limit of the observations. Typically, high resolution observations eventually show that larger HVCs are often composed of many smaller complexes. When detecting HVCs solely via HI emission, all of the HVCs in the Milky Way cover about 37% of the night sky. Most HVCs are somewhere between 2 and 15 kilo parsecs (kpc) across.  Lifetimes  Cold clouds moving through a diffuse halo medium are estimated to have a survival time on the order of a couple hundred million years without some sort of support mechanism that prevents them from dissipating. The lifetime mainly depends on the mass of the cloud, but also on the cloud density, halo density, and velocity of the cloud. HVCs in the galactic halo are destroyed through what is called the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The infall of clouds can dissipate energy leading to the inevitable heating of the halo medium. The multi-phase structure of the gaseous halo suggests that there is an ongoing life-cycle of HVC destruction and cooling.  Possible support mechanisms  Some possible mechanisms responsible for increasing the lifetime of an HVC include the presence of a magnetic field that induces a shielding effect and/or the presence of dark matter; however, there is no strong observational evidence for dark matter in HVCs. The most accepted mechanism is that of dynamical shielding, which increases the Kelvin-Helmholtz time. This process works due to the HVC having a cold neutral interior shielded by a warmer and lower-density exterior, causing the HI clouds to have smaller relative velocities with respect to their surroundings. Origins Since their discovery, several possible models have been proposed to explain the origins of HVCs. However, for observations in the Milky Way, the multiplicity of clouds, the distinct characteristics of IVCs, and the existence of clouds that are clearly associated with cannibalized dwarf galaxies (i.e. the Magellanic System among others) indicate that the HVCs most likely have several possible origins. This conclusion is also strongly supported by the fact that most simulations for any given model can account for some cloud behaviors, but not all. Oort's hypothesis Jan Oort developed a model to explain HVCs as gas left over from the early formation of the galaxy. He theorized that if this gas were at the edge of the galaxy's gravitational influence, over billions of years it could be dragged back toward the Galactic disk and fall back in as HVCs. Oort's model explained the observed chemical composition of the galaxy well. Given an isolated galaxy (i.e. one without ongoing assimilation of hydrogen gas), successive generations of stars should infuse the Interstellar Medium (ISM) with higher abundances of heavy elements. However, examinations of stars in the solar neighborhood show roughly the same relative abundances of the same elements regardless of the age of the star; this has come to be known as the G dwarf problem. HVCs may explain these observations by representing a portion of the primordial gas responsible for continuously diluting the ISM. Galactic fountain An alternative theory centers on gas being ejected out of the galaxy and falling back in as the high-velocity gas we observe. Several proposed mechanisms exist to explain how material can be ejected from the Galactic disk, but the most prevalent explanation of the Galactic Fountain centers on compounding supernova explosions to eject large \\"bubbles\\" of material. Since gas is being ejected from the disk of the galaxy, the observed metallicity of the ejected gas should be similar to that of the disk. While this may be ruled out for the source of HVCs, these conclusions may point to the Galactic Fountain as the source of IVCs. Accretion from satellite galaxies As dwarf galaxies pass through a larger galaxy's halo, the gas that exists as the interstellar medium of the dwarf galaxy may be stripped away by tidal forces and ram pressure stripping. Evidence for this model of HVC formation comes from observations of the Magellanic Stream in the halo of the Milky Way. The somewhat distinct features of HVCs formed in this way are also accounted for by simulations, and most HVCs in the Milky Way which are not associated with the Magellanic Stream do not seem to be at all associated with a dwarf galaxy. Dark matter Another model, proposed by David Eichler, now at Ben Gurion University, and later by Leo Blitz of the University of California at Berkeley, assumes the clouds are very massive, located between galaxies, and created when baryonic material pools near concentrations of dark matter. The gravitational attraction between the dark matter and the gas was intended to explain the ability of the clouds to remain stable even at intergalactic distances where the paucity of ambient material should cause the clouds to dissipate rather quickly. However, with the advent of distance determinations for most HVCs, this possibility may be ruled out. Galactic evolution To inquire into the origin and fate of a galaxy's halo gas is to inquire into the evolution of said galaxy. HVCs and IVCs are significant features of a spiral galaxy's structure. These clouds are of primary importance when considering a galaxy's Star formation rate (SFR). The Milky Way has approximately 5 billion solar masses of star forming material within its disk and a SFR of 1‚Äì3 \\\\begin{smallmatrix}M_\\\\odot\\\\end{smallmatrix} yr‚àí1. Models for galactic chemical evolution find that at least half of this amount must be continuously accreted, low-metallicity material to describe the current, observable structure. Without this accretion, the SFRs indicate that the current star formation material will only last for another few gigayears (Gyr) at most. Models of mass inflow place a maximal accretion rate of .4 \\\\begin{smallmatrix}M_\\\\odot\\\\end{smallmatrix} yr‚àí1 from HVCs. This rate does not meet that which is demanded by the chemical evolutionary models. Thus, it is a possibility that the Milky Way may go through a low point in gas content and/or decrease its SFR until further gas arrives. Consequently, when discussing HVCs in the context of galactic evolution, the conversation is largely concerned with star formation and how the future star material fuels the galactic disk. The current model for the universe, …ÖCDM, indicates that galaxies tend to cluster and achieve a web-like structure over time. Under such models, the large majority of baryons entering a galactic halo do so along these cosmic filaments. 70% of the mass inflow at the virial radius is consistent with coming in along cosmic filaments in evolutionary models of the Milky Way. Given current observational limitations, the majority of the filaments feeding into the Milky Way are not visible in HI. Despite this, some gas clouds within the Galaxy's halo have lower metallicities than that of gas stripped from satellites, suggesting that the clouds are primordial material probably flowing in along the cosmic filaments. Gas of this type, detectable out to ~160,000 ly (50 kpc), largely becomes part of the hot halo, cools and condenses, and falls into the Galactic disk to serve in star formation. Mechanical feedback mechanisms, supernova-driven or active galactic nuclei- driven outflows of gas, are also key elements in understanding the origin of a spiral galaxy's halo gas and the HVCs within. X-ray and gamma-ray observations in the Milky Way indicate the likelihood of some central engine feedback having occurred in the past 10‚Äì15 megayears (Myr). Furthermore, as described in ‚Äúorigins,‚Äù the disk-wide ‚Äúgalactic fountain‚Äù phenomenon is similarly crucial in piecing together the Milky Way's evolution. Materials ejected in the course of a galaxy's lifetime help describe observational data (observed metallicity content primarily) while providing feedback sources for future star formation. Likewise detailed in the \\"origins\\" section, satellite accretion plays a role in the evolution of a galaxy. Most galaxies are assumed to result from smaller precursors merging, and the process continues throughout a galaxy's lifetime. Within the next 10 billion years, further satellite galaxies will merge with Milky Way, sure to significantly impact the Milky Way's structure and steer its future evolution. Spiral galaxies have abundant sources for potential star-formation material, but how long galaxies are able to continuously draw on these resources remains in question. A future generation of observational tools and computational abilities will shed light on some of the technical details of the Milky Way's past and future as well as how HVCs play a role in its evolution.  Examples of HVCs   Northern Hemisphere  In the Northern Hemisphere, we find several large HVCs, though nothing on the order of the Magellanic System (discussed below). Complexes A and C were the first HVCs discovered and were first observed in 1963. Both of these clouds have been found to be deficient in heavy elements, showing a concentration that is 10‚Äì30% that of the Sun's. Their low metallicity seems to serve as proof that HVCs do indeed bring in ‚Äúfresh‚Äù gas. Complex C has been estimated to bring in 0.1‚Äì0.2 \\\\begin{smallmatrix}M_\\\\odot\\\\end{smallmatrix} of new material every year, whereas Complex A brings in about half that amount. This fresh gas is about 10‚Äì20% of the total needed to properly dilute Galactic gas enough to account for the chemical composition of stars. = Complex C = Complex C, one of the most well-studied HVCs, is at least 14,000 ly (about 4 kpc) distant but no more than 45,000 ly (about 14 kpc) above the Galactic plane. It should also be noted that Complex C has been observed to have about 1/50 of the nitrogen content that the Sun contains. Observations of high-mass stars indicate that they produce less nitrogen, as compared to other heavy elements, than do low-mass stars. This implies that the heavy elements in Complex C may come from high-mass stars. The earliest stars are known to have been higher-mass stars and so Complex C appears to be a fossil of sorts, formed outside the galaxy and made up of gas from the ancient universe. However, a more recent study of another area of Complex C has found a metallicity twice as high as what was reported originally. These measurements have led scientists to believe that Complex C has begun to mix with other, younger, nearby gas clouds. = Complex A = Complex A is located 25,000‚Äì30,000 ly (8‚Äì9 kpc) away in the galactic halo.  Southern Hemisphere  In the Southern Hemisphere, the most prominent HVCs are all associated with the Magellanic System which has two major components, the Magellanic Stream and the Leading Arm. They are both made of gas that was stripped from the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). Half of the gas was decelerated and now lags behind the clouds in their orbits (this is the stream component). The other half of the gas (the leading arm component) was accelerated and pulled out in front of the galaxies in their orbit. The Magellanic System is about 180,000 ly (55 kpc) from the Galactic disk, though the tip of the Magellanic Stream may extend out as far as 300,000‚Äì500,000 ly (100‚Äì150 kpc). The entire system is thought to contribute at least 3x108\\\\begin{smallmatrix}M_\\\\odot\\\\end{smallmatrix} of HI to the Galactic halo, about 30‚Äì50% of the HI mass of the Milky Way. = Magellanic Stream = The Magellanic Stream is seen as a ‚Äúlong, continuous structure with a well-defined velocity and column density gradient.‚Äù The velocity at the tip of the Magellanic Stream is hypothesized to be +300 km/s in the Galactic-standard-of- rest (GSR) frame. Stream clouds are thought to have a lower pressure than other HVCs because they reside in an area where the Galactic halo medium is more distant and has a much lower density. FUSE found highly ionized oxygen mixed in with the Magellanic Stream. This suggests that the stream must be embedded in hot gas. = Leading Arm = The Leading Arm is not one continuous stream, but rather an association of multiple clouds found in the region preceding the Magellanic Clouds. It is thought to have a velocity of ‚àí300 km/s in the GSR frame. One of the HVCs in the Leading Arm shows a composition very similar to the SMC. This seems to support the idea that the gas that comprises it was pulled off of the galaxy and accelerated in front of it via tidal forces which pull apart satellite galaxies and assimilate them into the Milky Way. = Smith's Cloud = This is another well-studied HVC found in the Southern Hemisphere.

A leading advocate for reforms of the Communist Party, C√≠sa≈ô introduced a series of liberal reforms to Communist Czechoslovakia, becoming a major figure in the Prague Spring as a result. He sought to create a new form of socialism with a \\"human face.\\" His reforms were repealed following the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. He was removed from office and expelled from the Communist Party until the Velvet Revolution of 1989. C√≠sa≈ô was born in Hostomice nad B√≠linou on 2 January 1920. He studied at Lyc√©e Carnot in Dijon, France. He attended Charles University in Prague but was forced to leave the school following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939. He worked as an accountant during the Nazi occupation and World War II. He joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSƒå) in 1945 following the end of the war.

Reuben Valentine later pleaded guilty to murder in a trial at the Nottingham Crown Court in October 2007. Valentine initially escaped but was later arrested. Background Spencer was born on 3 June 1989 at Nottingham City Hospital. He was born when his mother, Angela Spencer, had an emergency caesarean. He enjoyed basketball and music, and studied Music Technology at college. Murder On 6 March 2007 Spencer arrived home after attending college, telling his mother and stepfather that he had to meet a friend about a business idea and would not be late for tea. Later that evening he was approached by Valentine who goaded Spencer into a play fight, during which Valentine's jacket was torn. When Spencer refused to pay to replace the jacket a fight ensued, and Spencer was stabbed eight times, dying at the scene. Arrest and trial of Valentine Valentine was arrested in Nottingham after returning from a period in hiding with his family in Bristol. Prior to this, Spencer's parents had written a poem in an appeal to locate their son's killer. At the trial in Nottingham Crown Court Valentine pleaded not guilty, claiming that the killing was accidental. Although a second man arrested at the time of the murder declined to give evidence in court having previously named Valentine as the murderer, Valentine changed his plea before entering the court to give evidence. Before declaring a verdict Judge Michael Stokes, Recorder of Nottingham, agreed with Spencer's mother describing Valentine \\"barbaric and evil\\" and recommended that he serve a minimum of sixteen years in prison. Jason Spencer Trust In 2008 Angela Spencer and John Greensmith founded The Jason Spencer Trust to find a better way to support families bereaved due to murder and manslaughter, and to tackle knife crime. After years of fighting they have opened one of the very few support centres in Britain for families bereaved due to violent crime. The local teenagers came together to raise funds for The Jason Spencer Sports ground, which opened in 2011. Since then a skate park has been added. On April 2013, the trust opened a support centre for families bereaved due to violent crime, covering Nottingham and the East Midlands, with funding from the Ministry of Justice.

The subtropics are geographic and climate zones located roughly between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn and the 40th parallel in both hemispheres. Subtropical climate regions can exist at high elevations within the tropics, such as across the Mexican Plateau and in Vietnam and Taiwan. Six climate classifications utilise the term to help define the various temperature and precipitation regions for the planet Earth. Using the Trewartha climate classification eight or more months of the year within the subtropics have an average temperature at or above . The K√∂ppen climate classification instead classifies the warmest month above and the coldest above or depending on preference. Under both classifications, at least one month must average below or the climate is considered tropical. Leslie Holdridge defined the subtropical climates as having a mean annual biotemperature between the frost line or critical temperature line, 16¬∞C to 18¬∞C (depending on locations in the world) and 24¬∞C.LIFE ZONE ECOLOGY by L. R. Holdridge. The frost line separates the warm temperate region from the subtropical region. It represents the dividing line between two major physiological groups of evolved plants. On the warmer side of the line, the majority of the plants are sensitive to low temperatures. They can be killed back by frosts as they have not evolved to withstand periods of cold. On the colder temperate side of the line, the total flora is adapted to survive periods of variable length of low temperatures, whether as seeds in the case of the annuals or as perennial plants which can withstand the cold. The [16¬∞C-18¬∞C] segment is often \\"simplified\\" as 17¬∞C (= 2(log212+0;5) ‚âà 16.97¬∞C).The climate of Carpathian Region in the 20th century based on the original and modified Holdridge life zone system. The Holdridge subtropical climates straddle more or less the warmest subtropical climates and the less warm tropical climates as defined by the K√∂ppen-Geiger or Trewartha climate classifications. However Wladimir K√∂ppen has distinguished the hot or subtropical and tropical (semi-)arid climates (BWh or BSh) having an average annual temperature greater than or equal to from the cold or temperate (semi-)arid climates (BWk or BSk) whose annual temperature average is lower. This definition, though restricted to dry regions, is almost similar to Holdridge's. A great portion of the world's deserts are located within the subtropics, due to the development of the subtropical ridge. Within the humid monsoon regions in the subtropics, a wet season is seen annually during the summer, which is when most of the yearly rainfall falls. Within the Mediterranean climate region, the wet season occurs during the winter. Areas bordering warm oceans are prone to locally heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones, which can contribute a significant percentage of the annual rainfall. Plants such as date palms, citrus, mango, litchi, and avocado are grown within the subtropical zones. This is not a complete list and is not intended to be one. Many of the higher mountains at tropical latitudes have sparsely (if at all) inhabited areas with a subtropical climate. Africa French Garden in Alexandria, Egypt. Downtown Nairobi, Kenya.

Smash features an ensemble cast, with 13 regular cast members over the course of two seasons. The show is about the creation of Broadway musicals. The first season revolves around the creation of Bombshell, a musical about the life of Marilyn Monroe. The second season follows Bombshell's road to Broadway, and introduces a new musical, Hit List. Main characters Julia Houston Debra Messing portrays Julia Houston, a successful Broadway lyricist and Bombshell's co-writer. She is married with a son, but had an affair with Michael Swift, who played Joe DiMaggio in the initial Bombshell workshop. She initially reconciles with her husband Frank, but they decide to get a divorce early in the second season. Houston is based on creator Theresa Rebeck. Derek Wills Jack Davenport portrays Derek Wills, the often sleazy director and choreographer of Bombshell (in Season 1), who will stop at nothing to make the show a success. He has an on-and-off relationship with Bombshell star Ivy Lynn, though he has also shown interest in Karen Cartwright and had a physical relationship with Rebecca Duvall during the Boston preview before she left the show. In Season 2, he quits Bombshell and becomes the director and choreographer of Hit List. Karen Cartwright Katharine McPhee portrays Karen Cartwright, an ingenue from Iowa, who has a successful audition and becomes a serious contender for the role of Monroe in Bombshell. Somewhat new to show business, her naivet√© is generally scorned by her peers, though her talent is rarely called into question. She played Marilyn for the Boston preview, when Rebecca Duvall left. In season two, she is broken up with long-time boyfriend Dev after he cheated on her with Ivy in season one and begins seeing Jimmy Collins. She leaves Bombshell and joins Hit List. Tom Levitt Christian Borle portrays Tom Levitt, a theatrical composer and Julia's longtime songwriting partner. He and Derek Wills have an acrimonious relationship stemming from a business fallout 11 years ago. Tom, who is gay, briefly dates a Republican lawyer but later becomes attracted to Sam Strickland, a dancer in the ensemble of Bombshell. In Season 2, Tom and Sam break up and Tom becomes the director of Bombshell after Derek quits. Ivy Lynn Megan Hilty portrays Ivy Lynn, a seasoned performer who, at the beginning of the series, is working in the ensemble of Heaven On Earth, a Broadway musical that Tom and Julia wrote. Ivy is favored by nearly everyone on board with the production to play Marilyn Monroe in Bombshell, but after the workshop flops, she is replaced by a big movie star. Throughout the show, she's in an on-and-off relationship with the Bombshell director/choreographer Derek Wills and finds herself constantly competing with Karen in many different situations, eventually losing the role of Marilyn to her for the Boston previews. In the second season, she contemplates leaving show business, after Karen has her fired from Bombshell. She eventually decides to pursue other career options. She gets the female lead in Liaisons, but it ends up being a mess and closes. Karen leaves Bombshell about the same time for Hit List and Ivy takes back the lead of Bombshell. In \\"The Transfer,\\" she learns she is pregnant. Eileen Rand Anjelica Huston portrays Eileen Rand, Bombshell's tenacious producer, who is dealing with divorce proceedings from her husband, Jerry, which could threaten the musical and forces her to think outside the box in securing funds for the show. A running gag throughout the series is Eileen throwing drinks into Jerry's unsavory face. In the first season, she begins a relationship with a kind and handsome bartender, Nick, who later provides funding needed to get the show on Broadway. They lose funding early in the second season because the money is dirty and Nick goes to jail and ends their relationship. Because of the funding issue, Eileen briefly steps down as producer with Jerry stepping in. She gets the position back and starts to date a New York Times columnist. Ellis Boyd Jaime Cepero portrays Ellis Boyd, Tom's and later Eileen's conniving personal assistant during the first season, who is attempting to receive credit for Bombshell and make his way as a show producer. As the first season continues, Ellis, convinced that with an off-hand comment he is the inventor of Marilyn Monroe and somehow created the show, takes more inappropriate steps to be recognized as a producer, including giving Rebecca a drink mixed with peanuts, which she is allergic to, in order to remove her as the star. He boasts of this to Eileen as proof of his \\"skills\\" but she responds by firing him. Cepero did not return for season 2, though he makes small appearance in Episode 11 of season 2 during Tom's nightmare. Dev Sundaram Raza Jaffrey portrays Dev Sundaram, Karen's live-in boyfriend, who works in the office of the New York City mayor's press secretary who ultimately forces her to choose between their relationship or her career. He proposes marriage but when Karen is unsure, Dev sleeps with Ivy. Ivy tells Karen of their encounter and an angry Karen breaks up with Dev. Jaffrey did not return as part of the main cast for season 2. Frank Houston Brian d'Arcy James portrays Frank Houston, Julia's husband and a high-school chemistry teacher, who wishes that Julia would spend more time at home. He was upset when she confessed to her affair with Michael Swift and more so when he confronted Swift and learned Julia had cheated on him earlier in the marriage. They separated but eventually reconciled. However, they decide to get a divorce in the second season. Julia makes good with Frank in the series finale and they both go easy with their divorce proceedings. James was credited as recurring in Season 1's pilot, but was promoted to regular from episode 2. James did not return as part of the main cast for season 2. Sam Strickland Leslie Odom, Jr. portrays Sam Strickland, an ensemble member, a good friend of Ivy who is gay and very much into sports. Due to their mutual friendship with Ivy, he forms a connection with Tom. Sam and Tom break up in Season 2 as Sam takes a role in a touring production of The Book of Mormon. Sam returns to town and quits the Mormon job, but can only get a temporary position in Bombshell. After a fallout with Tom, he joins the cast of Hit List as JB Planko, manager for \\"The Diva\\" and Nina Hope. Initially recurring, Odom joins the main cast in season 2. Jimmy Collins Jeremy Jordan portrays Jimmy Collins, a young songwriter from Brooklyn with a troubled past. He has an aggressive temperament and owes thousands of dollars to his former drug lord & brother. He and his roommate Kyle are writing a new musical, Hit List. After hearing Jimmy singing a song that he wrote for it, Karen enlists the help of former Bombshell director, Derek. Karen & Derek eventually join the musical. Jordan joined the cast at the start of season 2.http://tvline.com/2012/06/14/smash-jeremy-jordan/ Kyle Bishop Andy Mientus portrays Kyle Bishop, a Jonathan Larson-like poor kid from Brooklyn with dreams of writing for Broadway. He and Jimmy are writing a musical Hit List. He wrote the book, and Jimmy wrote the music. He and Jimmy are childhood friends. Kyle saved Jimmy from his self-destruction and drug use. They have an apartment together. He does, however, have a crush on Jimmy. He begins dating the lighting technician for Hit List, Blake. However, a starstruck Kyle begins an affair with Tom Levitt after the Bombshell premiere. He dies after being hit by a car. They dim the lights at the theatre for him. He, post-humously wins the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical. Jimmy gives a speech honoring him. Mientus joined the cast at the start of the second season. Ana Vargas Krysta Rodriguez portrays Ana Vargas, Karen's new roommate and old friend who is looking for her big break and joins Hit List as \\"The Diva\\". After being kicked out of her role by Daisy Parker, she joins the national tour of the show Once. Rodriguez became a part of the cast in season 2.

The bulk of each issue consisted of translations into English of the articles and speeches of Japanese writers, scholars, and politicians.

Links with the Japanese government The Foreign Affairs Association of Japan which published Contemporary Japan had links with the Japanese government. In 1932 its administrative council included such figures as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Nobuaki Makino, former prime minister Kosai Uchida, future prime minister Fumimaro Konoe, and former foreign ministers Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara and Kikujiro Ishii. Though the magazine's first issue stressed that it had \\"no party affiliations, political or otherwise\\" and sought \\"to obtain as many representative opinions as possible\\",\\"Editorial Note\\", Contemporary Japan, June 1932, 3. it also opened with a special message from Foreign Minister Kenkichi Yoshizawa, which was stridently defensive of Japan's conduct in Manchuria and Shanghai.Kenkichi Yoshizawa, \\"The Foreign Minister's Message\\", Contemporary Japan, June 1932, 4-6. The periodical later explained that \\"on controversial subjects, where national viewpoints are in conflict, it can be taken for granted that our contributors will defend, expound, and do their utmost to propagate, the Japanese view\\".Cabot Coville, \\"Some Japanese Economic Writings of 1937\\", Monumenta Nipponica, January 1939, 306.

It was commissioned by public broadcasting organization ZDF, produced by the UFA subsidiary TeamWorx, and first aired in Germany and Austria in March 2013. The series tells the story of five German friends, aged around 20, on their different paths through Nazi Germany and World War II: as Wehrmacht soldiers on the Eastern Front, a war nurse, an aspiring singer, and a Jewish tailor. The narrative spans four years, starting in 1941 Berlin, when the friends meet up for a last time before embarking on their journeys, enthusiastically vowing to meet up again the following Christmas. The story's conclusion is set shortly after the end of the war in 1945. When the series first aired in Germany, each episode garnered around 7 million viewers. Generation War has generated much controversy. The Economist stated that hardly any German TV drama ever caused so much public debate. Critics have acknowledged the film to be well crafted, intense and unsparing in its depiction of combat on the eastern front. However, aspects such as the portrayal of the Polish resistance movement as anti-semites, the scant depiction of Nazi Germany's objective to purge the Reich of Jews, and the blurring of differences between non-German victims and German perpetrators have been deplored by others. Plot There are three 90 minute parts: A Different Time ('), A Different War ('), and A Different Country ('). Not all Germans were NSDAP members, or anti-Semites. The film conveys that, and yet does not gloss-over the forced use of the Heer by the RSHA to augment the Einsatzgruppen in Ukraine, and Poland. A Different Time Shortly before the German invasion of the Soviet Union, five close friends have a party at a pub in Berlin. The brothers Wilhelm and Friedhelm are respectively an officer and enlisted man in the military. Viktor is a Jew whose father owns a tailor shop. Charlotte has just passed her examination to become a military nurse. Greta is a beautiful bartender who wishes to become a famous singer. The friends are hopeful that they will meet again by Christmas. Wilhelm and Friedhelm witness some early victories as the German army advances toward Moscow. Charlotte gets used to seeing blood as she works near the front-line. Greta sleeps with a major in the Gestapo to advance her career as a singer, and to obtain documents for Viktor to flee to New York City. However, Viktor is arrested by the Gestapo and is put on a train to a concentration camp. A Different War The invasion is being pushed back by the Soviet Army, causing high casualties for the Germans. During an assault in which almost his entire platoon is killed, Wilhelm is knocked unconscious by an explosion and left for dead. When he wakes up, instead of going back to the base, he finds a cabin by a lake and lives on his own for a few weeks. He is discovered by the military police and sentenced to death for desertion. Friedhelm, having been cut off from his unit during the earlier assault, escapes the Russians by wearing a Soviet uniform, only to be mistakenly shot by his own side when returning to his lines. He is taken to a field hospital where Charlotte discovers him and convinces the doctor to operate, saving his life. While recovering, believing his brother to be dead, he tells Charlotte that Wilhelm has been killed. Friedhelm is sent back home, but seeing his father's disappointment with Wilhelm's apparent death, and lack of appreciation for Friedhelm's survival, Friedhelm cuts short his leave and returns to his unit. Viktor is sent to Auschwitz, but he manages to escape by breaking the wooden floor of the railroad car he is in, alongside a Polish woman called Alina, and joins a group of Polish partisans. He has to conceal his Jewish identity because they hate Jews. Charlotte feels despair over Wilhelm's apparent death and starts an affair with the doctor who saved Friedhelm. Greta visits the front-line to perform for the many soldiers. In the apartment where she stays, she is reunited with Wilhelm, Friedhelm and Charlotte for a brief moment. She visits Charlotte's workplace and becomes disillusioned by what she sees. Back in Germany, she returns to the bar where she works and tells the soldiers who have returned from the battlefield that victory is still a long way to go. The day after, she is arrested by the Gestapo and thrown into prison for making remarks in public that disapprove of the war and the Hitler regime and also probably because of her attempts to contact the same Gestapo major in the first episode (calling him at home, which, as his mistress, was unacceptable). When the major questions her, she tells him that she has become pregnant. A Different Country The Soviet army is pushing toward Berlin. Not just the war but also National Socialism's existence are doomed. Wilhelm's death sentence is reduced to probation and he is assigned to a disciplinary battalion. A sadistic sergeant abuses Wilhelm, who Wilhelm eventually kills before escaping the battalion. Charlotte befriends a Russian nurse named Sonja. After liberating prisoners from a train on the way to a camp, Viktor is expelled from the partisans, because they have found out he was Jewish. Charlotte sees Wilhelm again and has an emotional breakdown, because she thought he was dead. Viktor crosses paths with Friedhelm, who kills an SD commander, enabling Viktor to escape. When the field hospital is overrun, Charlotte is captured and almost raped by the Soviets but is saved by Lilija and is forced to become a nurse for them. She sees Sonja being tortured as a traitor and then being executed. After the German army falls apart, Friedhelm dies while leading a group of German militia, sacrificing himself to make his troops surrender. In the war's last days, Greta is executed by the Nazi German authorities for her speech crimes, and her possession of incriminating evidence about her former Gestapo lover - who, it is intimated, has ordered her execution. Shortly after the end of the war, the three survivors, Wilhelm, Viktor, and Charlotte, meet in the ruins of the same pub as before and grieve together for their lost friends, but without any sense of triumph over their survival. Main characters Wilhelm Winter Wilhelm (Volker Bruch) is the narrator of the story. He provides the opening monologue for the episodes, and when the plot jumps in time he summarizes the developments that happened in the meantime. In the pilot episode he states that he has served in the invasion of Poland as well as in the invasion of France. He is somewhat aware that Charlotte has feelings for him, but tells his brother and other fellow soldiers that he doesn't want to get her hopes up, presumably as he could be killed on the front lines before he could reciprocate. Wilhelm firmly believes he is bound by honor to fight as a soldier for his home country. Consequently, he is determined to do what he considers his duty as a Wehrmacht officer commanding an infantry platoon and he executes a prisoner in accordance with the Commissar Order. As the war goes on he is awarded the Iron Cross 1st class and promoted to Oberleutnant but the hope for a quick victory evaporates and so does his na√Øve idealism. Facing the death of his whole platoon to achieve a questionable objective, he walks away from the front line after suffering from a concussion caused by a Panzerfaust anti-tank explosive. He then seeks refuge in a cabin by a lake where he is arrested as a deserter by Feldgendarmerie officers. Instead of being executed, he is placed in a Strafbattalion (Penal Battalion). He is continually broken down further, through the actions of his sadistic platoon leader, and then when he is reunited with Charlotte (as a member of the Penal Battalion), she is incredulous that he is alive. He kills his platoon leader a while later, and escapes with a fellow soldier back to Berlin. At the series' end, he, Charlotte, and Viktor gather in the rubble of the bar where Greta worked in occupied Berlin, and hold a solemn toast to Greta and Friedhelm. Charlotte Charlotte (Miriam Stein), referred to as \\"Charly\\" by the circle of friends, secretly loves Wilhelm. When the war begins she volunteers as a nurse. She initially cannot bear to witness the suffering of wounded soldiers, but over the course of the campaign she hardens considerably. After being expelled from the operating theatre for dropping a scalpel, she is reassigned as a general nurse. Because the medical staff are overworked and in short supply, she is allowed to get assistance from local Ukrainian medical workers. She employs a Ukrainian assistant named Lilija who, when asked, denies being a Jew. After morphine goes missing, Charlotte investigates and discovers a photograph of Lilija's family standing in front of a menorah. She confronts Lilija, who admits to being a Jewish born medical doctor. Upon hearing this admission, Charlotte wrestles with her conscience but in the end decides to report her to the authorities. However, shortly afterwards, when she sees Gestapo officers approaching the ward she tries to warn Lilija to run away. But before Lilija can act, another German nurse points her out to the authorities who are \\"looking for a Jew hiding in the hospital\\" and they take her away. Charlotte's grief is further compounded when a wounded Friedhelm claims that Wilhelm was killed in action and she has an affair with the chief surgeon. Things only get worse when Wilhelm later turns up as a Penal Battalion soldier at her field hospital as the German Army is retreating on the Eastern Front. She angrily pushes Wilhelm away after confessing she is in love with him, and runs away to cry. When she regains her composure to try and speak with him again, she finds that he is gone. As the front very quickly closes in, Charlotte, a local aide, Sonja, and a group of seriously wounded soldiers fail to evacuate and are left behind to face the advancing Red Army, whose men kill the rest of the wounded soldiers in their beds and proceed to arrest Sonja as a collaborator and rape Charlotte. Just then Lilija, having been freed by the Russians and now in their service as an officer, shows up, interrupts the rape, and saves Charlotte from further harm (execution) by arranging her inclusion as a nurse in the Soviet field hospital. She does however proceed to shoot Sonja, stating there was nothing she could do to alter a death penalty for a collaborator, noting that she has at least saved her from suffering sexual abuse at the hand of the soldiers. At the war's end, she, Wilhelm, and Viktor have a solemn reunion in the rubble of the bar where Greta worked. Greta M√ºller Greta (Katharina Sch√ºttler) is a bartender at a local tavern in Berlin, and an ambitious singer who wants to succeed by any means. When the Gestapo officer Martin Dorn crashes their going-away party (in the pilot episode), she admits to possessing the Teddy Stauffer swing-dance record the five friends are dancing to in order to stall the officer and prevents her Jewish boyfriend Viktor from being discovered out past curfew. She starts a love affair with Dorn to try to worm out of the charges of incitement; Dorn, in return, promotes her career for propaganda efforts. When she becomes a threat to his own marriage, he organizes a USO-like road show in the midst of the Eastern Front. She is briefly reunited with Friedhelm, Wilhelm, and Charlotte in her improvised dressing room after her performance, but cuts short the reunion (much to the other friends' dismay) to attend a private party held by the senior commanders. Greta is stranded when her driver and pilot leave her behind at the start of the Battle of Kursk as she takes too long to pack her belongings. Charlotte forces her to help tend to wounded Heer soldiers at her field hospital, and the experience clearly traumatizes Greta. By chance she manages to return to her bar in Berlin, where she openly expresses her doubts in the Endsieg to a group of partying soldiers, and angers Dorn by revealing their affair to his wife, both of which lead to her getting arrested and imprisoned for Wehrkraftzersetzung (\\"subversion of the war effort\\") and defeatism. When she is arrested, she reveals that she had become impregnated by Dorn. He is shocked by this and then punches her in the stomach hard, to end her pregnancy. She is imprisoned and eventually executed by a firing squad in the final days of the war. Viktor Goldstein Viktor (Ludwig Trepte) is Greta's secret lover. Because of his Jewish background both of them live in constant fear that they will be accused of Rassenschande (\\"racial shame\\", \\"racial defilement\\", or \\"racial pollution\\"). Attempting to help him escape deportation, Greta manipulates Dorn into giving him a passport to the USA, but Dorn double-crosses him and on the day of his departure Viktor is arrested by Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp. On the way there he escapes from the train, along with a Polish woman named Alina, and joins a group of Polish Armia Krajowa partisans. During his time there he has to keep his Jewish background a secret due to widespread anti-Semitism within the group. As the group is about to carry out an ambush on a motorized Wehrmacht squad, Viktor, by chance, recognizes Friedhelm as one of the drivers, and feigns his participation in the attack allowing Friedhelm to pass safely through the ambush and inadvertently saving the life of Hiemer, his SD officer passenger. Later, the group ambushes and raids a German train for weapons, whereupon they discover that a large part of its cargo is Jewish prisoners, whom they refuse to free. A conflicted Viktor decides openly to defy them and frees the prisoners, angering the other partisans who consider executing him. However, their leader, having become sympathetic towards Viktor, allows him to walk away from the group in peace. Just after Viktor leaves, the partisans are betrayed and their hide-out is attacked by Friedhelm's squad, but Friedhelm recognizes Viktor and allows him to escape amidst the confusion, having shot SD officer Hiemer who has also appeared. After the end of the war Viktor returns to Berlin to find out that both his parents and Greta are dead, that new residents have taken over his family's apartment, and that Dorn is now a member of the allies' postwar administration under the protection of U.S. army, much to his fury. At the end of the war Viktor reunites with Charlotte and Wilhelm in the rubble of the bar where Greta worked. Friedhelm Winter Friedhelm Winter, played by Tom Schilling Friedhelm (Tom Schilling) is a sensitive young man who has no ambitions as a soldier. His comrades deride him as a foolhardy coward who puts their lives at greater risk and they beat him up after it is perceived he gave away their position to a Polikarpov Po-2 \\"sewing machine\\" by lighting a cigarette. Friedhelm becomes emotionally hardened and ruthless throughout the Eastern front campaign, willingly executing prisoners, and leading a charge to take a Russian telegraph station after witnessing his brother's apparent death by a Panzerfaust. He is shot by his fellow soldiers when they mistake him for a Russian (when he had stolen a Russian uniform to escape from aforementioned telegraph station upon its recapture by the Red Army). Charlotte manages to save him by begging the chief surgeon of the field hospital to operate on him, despite the surgeon's bleak triage assessment. Before being sent back to Berlin he tells Charlotte (mistakenly) that Wilhelm perished in the Panzerfaust attack. He becomes a prot√©g√© of SD officer Hiemer, who uses him as an executioner during the numerous anti-partisan actions in occupied Poland. But during a raid on a Polish partisan group, Friedhelm has a chance encounter with Viktor, and when Hiemer orders him to shoot Viktor, Friedhelm instead betrays and kills Hiemer, allowing Viktor to escape. Near the end of the war he has been promoted to the rank of Unteroffizier (equivalent to UK Corporal / US Sergeant) and leads a group of Volkssturm soldiers comprising old men and Hitler Youth boys shaped by their stubborn will to fight against the Soviets. Friedhelm orders them to stay put and walks alone towards the enemy aiming his rifle at them causing himself to be gunned down. The Volkssturm soldiers surrender after witnessing Friedhelm's futile death by fire from a Maxim machine gun.

Reception The series has received a 60% \\"fresh\\" rating on the popular critical aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes signifying mixed reviews.  Reception in Germany  When the series aired in Germany in March 2013, each episode had some 7 million viewers. The series was awarded the Deutscher Fernsehpreis 2013 (German Television Award) for the best multi- part television film of 2013. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that the film would give the remaining survivors of the World War II generation an opportunity to discuss it with their families. The film had introduced a new phase in historical films on the Nazi era. The historian Norbert Frei praised the film for showing, for the first time on German television, an unvarnished portrait of Germany's war against the Soviet Union, including the participation of the Wehrmacht in murdering Jews, the shooting of hostages as reprisals against partisan resistance, and the looting of homes vacated by Jews. He wrote that the film did not present idealised one-dimensional figures, but people of broken character who become aware of their shared guilt. Several German historians criticised the film. The historian Ulrich Herbert wrote that the film showed Nazis as \\"others\\", different from \\"Our Mothers and Fathers\\". It showed all Germans as victims. The film showed nothing of the love and trust that Hitler inspired in German youth, or of the widespread belief that Germany deserved to rule Europe. In reality, he wrote, these \\"mothers and fathers\\" were a highly ideological and politicised generation, who wanted Nazi Germany to win victory, because that would be right. The historian Habbo Knoch said that the film failed to show how the Nazi system functioned. The film showed 20-year-old characters who became victims of war, but missing were the 30- to 40-year-old Germans who built the Nazi system and supported it out of a mixture of conviction and self-interest. The film should have shown those who profited from the Nazi system. According to historian Lukas Meissel, ‚ÄúHistorical guilt is often talked about or portrayed in a somewhat elusive way, making it easy to relativize.\\" Three stereotypes are advanced to downplay Nazi German crimes: \\"1. The Poles are shown as even more anti-Semitic than the Germans. Furthermore, they are presented as convinced ideological anti-Semites, whereas the German characters are portrayed mostly as not ideological. 2. Soviet soldiers are presented in a primarily negative light. ‚Ä¶ 3. The Americans (and not the Germans) use ‚Äòformer‚Äô Nazis to pursue their own interests‚Ä¶‚ÄùLessons and Legacies XII: New Directions in Holocaust Research and Education. Northwestern University Press, 2017, pp. 418‚Äì419. A critic in the K√∂lner Stadt-Anzeiger called the film kitschy, devoid of deeper meaning, and morally worst, full of pathetic self- pity. The film's message was \\"We perpetrators (of war crimes) didn't have an easy time.\\" In the German Jewish weekly ', Jennifer Nathalie Pyka wrote that the achievement of the producers of Generation War lay in producing a film about World War II in which the troublesome question of how six million Jews were killed had been simply blanked out and omitted. The film provided an epiphany for those who had always known that not only Jews were Hitler's victims, but more important ‚Äì all Germans were Hitler's victims.  Reception in Poland  Many Polish viewers were outraged at the depiction of Poles as anti-semites. Tygodnik Powszechny described the film as \\"falsification of history\\" in depicting all Poles as fanatical anti-semites, even more so than the Germans who are shown as \\"basically good people\\" misled by the Nazis. Critics stated that the screenwriters sought to slander the Polish anti-Nazi resistance underground army Armia Krajowa which is shown in the film as rabidly anti-semitic. In fact, the Armia Krajowa had a branch called ≈ªegota devoted to the rescue of Jews from the Holocaust in Poland carried out by the Germans. The Polish ambassador in Austria, Jerzy Marganski, and the Polish embassy in Germany sent a letter of complaint to the German broadcaster ZDF pointing out that the Armia Krajowa had Jewish members, and that Poles constituted one-quarter of the Righteous Among the Nations honored at Yad Vashem. The broadcaster issued a statement that it was regrettable that the role of Polish characters had been interpreted as unfair and hurtful: \\"The deeds and responsibility of the Germans should in no way be relativized.\\" Poland's largest daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza published a review under the title \\"Who can explain to the Germans that the Armia Krajowa was not the SS?\\" The critic said the movie was the newest of a genre of German poor-quality historical films seeking sympathy for Nazi Germany. Their recipe, he wrote, \\"tastes like a western movie, but in the background waves a flag with a swastika.\\" The Polish ambassador to the US, Ryszard Schnepf, sent a written complaint to Music Box, who had bought the US rights to the series. He was supported by the director of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, ≈Åukasz Kami≈Ñski, who feared that people who were unfamiliar with European history may be led to believe that Armia Krajowa members were all antisemitic. Plans to broadcast the series in the UK led to a demonstration by Polish activists in London. The Polish ambassador to the UK, Witold Sobk√≥w, criticized the movie in The Huffington Post, United Kingdom, THE BLOG.  Comments in the UK and US  Commenting on its success in Germany, The Economist wrote that some German critics suggested that, \\"putting five sympathetic young protagonists into a harrowing story just offers the war generation a fresh bunch of excuses.\\" The Daily Telegraph wrote that Generation War, \\"has been hailed by critics as a 'turning point' in German television for examining the crimes of the Third Reich at an individual level,\\" and that it, \\"explores the seductive aspect of Nazism.\\" Jackson Janes, president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at the Johns Hopkins University, commented that the series \\"does not filter the Nazi atrocities nor the reality of war. Instead, it tries to portray how the millions of people who followed Hitler into the catastrophe he created were attracted to the vision he offered, only to then be confronted with trying to survive it.\\" The Hollywood Reporter noted that the sales company in Cannes billed the series as \\"a German equivalent to HBO's Band of Brothers.\\" When the three-part TV film saw a limited theatrical release in the United States as a four-and-a-half-hour two-part film on January 15, 2014, The New York Times reviewer A.O. Scott stated that by not showing the Nazi death camps, Generation War perpetuates \\"the notion that ordinary Germans were duped by the Nazis and ignorant of the extent of their crimes.\\" The review ends with the comment that of the five protagonists, \\"the artist, the intellectual and the Jew are all punished, for wantonness, weakness and na√Øvet√©, and pushed into extreme states of moral compromise, [while] the chaste, self-sacrificing Aryans, the lieutenant and the nurse, though they are not without guilt, are the heroes of the story, just as they would have been in a German film made in 1943.\\" According to the NPR review by Ella Taylor, the film depicts how totalitarianism corrupts almost everything in its path, including individual responsibility. The New Yorker reviewer David Denby wrote that \\"Generation War has the strengths and the weaknesses of middlebrow art: it may be clunky, but it's never dull, and, once you start watching, you can't stop,\\" and \\"the old accepted notion that the barbarians were confined to the S.S. and the Gestapo has been cast aside. The series acknowledges what scholars have established in recent years: that the Wehrmacht played a major role in committing atrocities in the occupied countries.\\" But \\"while destroying one myth, the filmmakers have built up another. The movie says that young men and women were seduced and then savagely betrayed‚Äîbrutalized by what the Nazis and the war itself put them through. Their complicity, in this account, is forced, never chosen. Aimed at today's Germans, who would like, perhaps, to come to a final reckoning with the war period, Generation War is an appeal for forgiveness. But the movie sells dubious innocence in the hope of eliciting reconciliation.\\" The Tablet reviewer Laurence Zuckerman said that Generation War's presentation of World War II Germans as tolerant and free of anti- Semitism was \\"wildly out of sync\\" with what scholars have learned from letters, diaries and other primary sources. In reality, \\"most ordinary Germans at the time held attitudes of casual racism at the very least, and a strong sense of imperial entitlement over Jews, Slavs and other races deemed racially and culturally inferior. The series tries to draw a distinction between Nazis and everyday Germans that simply did not exist in any broad way. The tagline on the movie's poster ‚Äì 'What happens when the country you love betrays everything you believe?' ‚Äì is demonstrably false. Most Germans believed in the Nazi agenda.\\" The Spectator reviewer James Delingpole criticized the series as \\"semi-apologia\\" that \\"had ducked frank and fearless authenticity in favour of face-saving, intellectually dishonest, respectful melodrama that leaves its audience feeling frustrated, cheated and rudderless\\". He criticizes the film's portrayal of its main characters as non-zealots, spirited young people forced to confront unpleasant realities and make agonizing choices as ahistorical; James Delingpole describes a leading character (Friedhelm) as \\"a 21st-century German parachuted into a period where he wouldn't have survived more than a few seconds\\". According to German-British journalist Alan Posener, \\"While the shows dealing with communist East Germany are realistic, the Third Reich gets off too lightly. None of the new productions directly addresses the Holocaust or other Nazi crimes. The dramas don‚Äôt even focus on the resistance to Hitler. Instead, most Germans appear as victims...The 2013 miniseries Unsere M√ºtter, unsere V√§ter (released as Generation War in English) continued the trend\\". Israeli reviews Uri Avnery's review of \\"Their Mothers, Their Fathers\\" appeared 28 February 2014 on International Policy Digest. Avnery himself fled from Germany to Mandatory Palestine in 1933. Concerning the film's not showing Nazi death camps, Avnery writes \\"The Holocaust is not the center of events, but it is there all the time, not as a separate event but woven into the fabric of reality.\\" He describes the progression of two of the protagonists: \\"Death is all around them, they see horrible war crimes, they are commanded to shoot prisoners, they see Jewish children butchered. In the beginning they still dare to protest feebly, then they keep their doubts to themselves, then they take part in the crimes as a matter of course.\\" He propounds a theory of the individual in totalitarian circumstances: \\"It is this element of the situation that is difficult for many people to grasp. A citizen under a criminal totalitarian regime becomes a child. Propaganda becomes for him reality, the only reality he knows. It is more effective than even the terror.\\" He sees the Jews and the Germans as two still traumatized peoples. \\"That's why the film is so important, not only for the Germans, but for every people, including our own.\\" Uri Klein's review of Generation War appeared 2 September 2014 in Haaretz. Concerning the miniseries not showing Nazi death camps, Klein writes, \\"... no extermination camps are shown in the series, whose measure of brutality and blatant anti-Semitism is meted out by the Polish partisans ... and by the Russian army.\\" This is due to the portrayal of the five main characters in a sympathetic light of \\"heroism and sacrifice, loyalty and betrayal, love and its price\\" which is detached from actual historical events. Instead of history, Klein likens the production to a typical Hollywood product of action, special effects, and a romanticized story of essentially noble individuals caught up in a war not of their choice. \\"The difficulties that they experience, like their personality crises, stem from the fact that, as we have learned from the movies dozens of times, war ‚Äì any war ‚Äì is hell.\\" Score The score was released in Germany on 15 March 2013 on CD and in a digital format. The CD consists of 22 pieces. The digital release of the score consists of 42 pieces.

The fortress capitulated on 30 April 1794. Background In the amended that the military leaders of the Coalition agreed upon in The Hague in early April the capture of the fortress of Landrecies was a key objective. The mobile army of the States Army (which had not been active since the Battle of Menin (1793)) was charged with obtaining this objective.This was possibly because the States Army was strong in siege artillery. Fran√ßois de Bas writes that the Dutch offered their artillery to the British at the siege of Dunkirk (1793) but that York insisted on shipping British siege artillery overseas; Cf. Bas, p. 201. Landrecies had long been a contested city between France and the Habsburg Netherlands of which it originally a part. In 1543 the French conquered it and repulsed an attempt by Charles V to retake it, though it was returned to him at the ensuing peace. In 1655 the city was taken by the French after a brief siege and not returned to the Spanish Netherlands at the Treaty of the Pyrenees of 1659. S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban then gave it a fortress built according to the latest military practice. This made it impregnable in the Franco-Dutch War, and the War of the Spanish Succession when it withstood an attempt by Prince Eugene in 1712 to capture it. The Coalition armies, under supreme command of the Austrian emperor Francis II were facing the French armies under general Jean-Charles Pichegru. The French started the Spring campaign of 1794 in March but in early April the Coalition forces in Flanders were ready to start their offensive. Emperor Francis reviewed the troops of the combined British‚ÄìAustrian‚ÄìDutch army on 16 April 1794 near Cateau- Cambr√©sis. The next day, 17 April, the Allies attacked on a very broad front. The Dutch mobile army reached the glacis of the fortress of Cambrai that evening. The columns of the Prince of Hessen-Darmstadt and Major-General Van der Duyn captured Catillon-sur-Sambre, near Landrecies that evening. The siege The Dutch mobile army (about 16,000 strong) was reinforced with Austrian infantry and auxiliaries under command of Major-General Count Baillet de Latour and Austrian artillery under Major-General Johann Kollowrat (about 4,000). On 18 April 1794 this corps left its camp near Cambrai and marched on Landrecies. On 19 April the force mad preparations preparations and on 20 April the corps opened a three-pronged attack on the fortress. Two columns marched via Fontaine-au-Bois and the For√™t de Mormal toward the Sambre river, where they took the villages of Hapegarde, Etoguis and the reinforced camp of Preux-au-Bois, within range of the artillery of the fortress. The Swiss Guards of the brigade of De Gumo√´ns and the brigade of Hesse-Darmstadt distinguished themselves in this fight.Switzerland itself was not a belligerent in this war. The States Army had used Swiss mercenary regiments for more than a century by 1794. In fact, many, if not most, soldiers in the army were foreign professionals. \\"Dutch\\" should therefore be read as \\"in Dutch service\\" in this context.Jomini speaks of the \\"brigade of Paravicini,\\" instead of De Gumo√´ns, but this must be an error, as major-general Paravicini de Capelli was a gunner and did not command the Swiss brigade.Cf. De Bas, p. 312 The middle column overran the redoubts and demi-lunes of the outer fortress. The garrison of the fortress was forced to withdraw within its walls. The Dutch losses were 23 officers and 358 other ranks. The mobile army immediately started to invest the fortress. Work was begun on a line of field works that ran in front of the fortress, with its endpoints on the Sambre river, cutting the fortress off from overland access. Two batteries were placed on the main approaches to the town, and work on a second, countervailing, system of trenches was prepared. The Hereditary Prince made the chateau of Bousies his headquarters, and the Austrian auxiliaries (Hungarians, Serbs and Croats), destined to do the spadework for the entrenchments, built a camp in the forest of Mormal. After 20 April the preparations for the intended bombardment progressed slowly as the mobile army had to provide troops for the operations of the other Coalition forces that were needed to deflect French attempts at relief of the fortress (8,000 men on 22 April alone). Those attempts at relief were defeated by the Coalition in the Battles of Villers-en-Cauchies and Beaumont-en- Cambresis. Sorties by the garrison also hindered the preparations. On 26 April the stadtholder, William V, the father of the Hereditary Prince, and Captain- General of the States Army, paid a visit to the camp of the besiegers. During this visit the son ordered a demonstration of the artillery, though not all guns were yet in place. The stadtholder was so impressed that he decided to stay for the rest of the bombardment, to do a bit of \\"siege-seeing\\". Scene by Louis Joseph Watteau from the siege of Lille in 1792, which resembles what Landrecies must have looked like. The gun emplacements were finished on 28 April. Eleven batteries with a total of 48 guns (varying from 3-pdrs to 24-pdrs) and 18 siege mortars (varying from 30 to 60 pounds caliber) were in place. These guns would fire about 14,000 projectiles during the three days of the bombardment, that started on 28 April. The devastation of the fortress and town was immense. Hardly a house remained undamaged. The front of the attack was leveled. Around 2,000 people (both soldiers and civilians) were killed (one mortar bomb killed a woman and her eight children at one stroke). But the civilians took part in the defense, organised as artilleurs-bourgeois (burgher artillerists) and stood shoulder to shoulder with the battalions of the Meuse and Moselle that formed the garrison. Their wives nursed the wounded and succoured the dying. The city would later collectively receive the L√©gion d'Honneur for its bravery. Despite the severe losses the garrison commander, general Roulland, at first refused repeated demands to surrender, possibly because the French launched a desperate last attempt to relieve the fortress on 27 April, but this again came to nothing. However, the bombardment did not miss its influence on the morale of the troops. On 29 April an order for a sortie was refused and Roulland convened a council of war of the soldiers, as was sometimes done in the French revolutionary army. This council asked him to consider a surrender. The pressure of the council steadily increased and on 30 April Roulland gave in: he asked for a ceasefire. This was immediately granted, and followed by protracted negotiations about a capitulation on terms. The negotiations were conducted by the Dutch quarter-master-general Bentinck and the Austrian major-general Mack on the Coalition side, and general Roulland on the French side. They led to the capitulation with honor of the French garrison on 30 April. The garrison had been reduced to 5,000 men. They became prisoners-of-war in the Dutch Republic. The fortress was taken over by Swiss and Dutch Guard regiments. Aftermath The next day Emperor Francis and the stadtholder reviewed the defeated French troops filing by. The Hereditary Prince handed the keys of the city to the Emperor at this occasion. After the fall of Landrecies the Austrians did nothing for eleven days, as if they had forgotten why the fortress had been taken in the first place. Only on 12 May did operations of the combined Austro-Dutch forces resume near Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis. A chance to cut off Pichegru was missed, however, because of hesitation by the Emperor. This did not bode well for the remainder of the campaign. Indeed the tide eventually turned in favor of the French after the Battle of Fleurus (26 June 1794), and they retook Landrecies on 17 July 1794 after a brief siege. The Hereditary Prince apparently had made a good impression on the Emperor. When general Kaunitz disappointed him by his hesitant conduct, the Emperor replaced him by the Hereditary Prince in May 1794, giving the Prince command of all Dutch and Austrian forces near the Sambre.

This occurred about a year and a half before the collapse of an illegal building in Thane on 4 April 2013, killing 74 people. Illegal buildings In 2011, Lahoria informed municipal and state authorities that within Navi Mumbai there were more than 600 illegal buildings. He also filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court. Construction of the buildings also violated floor space index (FSI) rules, including development of additional storeys. 21 towers on Palm Beach Road were included in the count of 600 illegal buildings. According to Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation's (NMMC) town planning officer, Prakash Thakur: one of the towers is being investigated by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority and action has been taken on 20 towers. In addition to the complaints to governmental authorities and the court, he also questioned CIDCO and Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation's (NMMC) role in allowing the construction to occur. Starting the latter half of 2011, about six months before Lahoria's murder, he received death threats from builders with criminal connections. Although protection was requested of the Navi Mumbai police, he never received it. Death In February 2013, Lahoria sustained five bullet wounds and a slash to his hand and neck outside of S K Brothers Builders & Developers' Office, his real estate company in Navi Mumbai. The two men who shot him wore private security guard uniforms, one of whom knocked a coconut into his head after he had fallen to the ground. Intending to perform a mock funeral, the men had 'agarbattis' and a garland with them Having seen the incident, two workers in Lahoria's office chased the men. They were able to catch one of the men, a hitman named Venkatesh Shettiyar, who was placed in police custody. The victim's son, Sunny Kumar, claimed that the names of \\"two prominent developers\\" had been given by the captured gunman; on the other hand, the gunman told police that he committed the murder because he had not been paid a large commission. Anurag Garg and Suresh Bijlani, both still escaping incarceration, are suspects in his murder. Lahoria's son, Sandeep Kumar has continued his father's crusade to mitigate illegal buildings. He has also written to the state Director General of Police and the Prime Minister's Office about the handling of his father's murder investigation. He called out two specific Navi Mumbai senior policemen and questioned the easy treatment of the suspects, including not seizing their passports. Of his father, he said: > My father paid a very heavy price for exposing irregularities that took > place with the active involvement of government officers. He made use of the > Right to Information Act to deal with corruption, but he was killed.

In 2014 Swamp Angel was a runner-up (Honor Book) for the Phoenix Picture Book Award from the Children's Literature Association, which annually recognizes the best picture book that did not win a major award 20 years earlier. \\"Books are considered not only for the quality of their illustrations, but for the way pictures and text work together.\\"\\"Phoenix Picture Book Award\\" . Children's Literature Association. Retrieved 2014-07-11.  Biography   Early life  Isaacs was born in 1949, in Buffalo, New York, and lived there until she left for college in 1967. She attended the University of Michigan, where she received bachelor's degrees in English Literature and Environmental Education and her MS in 1975. Since then she has lived in various cities in Canada and in California. Isaacs married Samuel Koplowicz, a media producer, in 1978. She and her husband and three kids now live in Berkeley, on the San Francisco Bay. Writing fiction is her second profession as she held a series of positions in the field of environmental education until the mid-1980s.  Inspiration  \\"All my life\\", says Isaacs, \\"poetry has affected me more than any other genre. I have read and memorized it, studied it, loved, and written it since I was nine.\\" As a child she has called herself \\"shy and usually lost in a world of my imagination. I read constantly from fourth grade on, plucking books haphazardly from my parents' or the library's shelves: Romeo and Juliet, Lorna Doone, Wind in the Willows, The Caine Mutiny. In fourth grade I was changed forever by my first readings of Shakespeare and Coleridge. I was spellbound by their emotional directness, interweaving of thought and feeling, and above, all, the pure music of their words. I read Little Women more times than any other book. Like the heroine, Jo, I grew up to combine careers as an educator, mother, and children's book writer.\\"  First writings  Isaacs dabbled in writing as a child, but it wasn't until she had children of her own that she began to write seriously, and to think about trying to get a book published. She has said \\"I seem fated to come to books in reverse order. I mainly read adult literature as a child, but as an adult I began to read children's literature, often encountering a classic work for the first time while reading it to my children.\\"  Major works   Swamp Angel  Isaacs came up with the idea for Swamp Angel while reading a dictionary of historical American words, and happening upon the term \\"swamp angel\\". Then one day her daughter arrived home complaining about \\"Pioneer Days\\" activities at school: the boys got to chop wood, the girls had to make quilting squares. The idea of \\"Swamp Angel\\" was to have a girl in a tall tale doing extraordinary and strong actions. Angelic Longrider or \\"Swamp Angel\\" becomes the greatest woodsman in Tennessee in an original American tall tale, one much like those of Paul Bunyan and Pecos Bill. Taller than her mother at birth, Swamp Angel builds her first log cabin at the age of two. After many great feats, she takes on Thundering Tarnation, a black bear \\"with bottomless appetite for settlers' grub\\". Eventually she sends Tarnation up to the sky, where he becomes a constellation.

Treehouse Tales  A strange treehouse is the setting for the adventures of three 1880s Pennsylvania farm children who experience it, in turn, as a refuge, a lookout post, and a frightening dragon's lair. In three interlocking stories, Tom, Emily, and Nathaniel each confront the mischief that ensues when their dreams come all too true. The stories are fairytale-like and romantic in their reading. Treehouse Tales started out its life as Outhouse Tales, a group of stories that all had something to do with an outhouse. The stories were semi- autobiographical, taken from humorous experiences at a girl scout camp where Isaacs was a counselor. She decided to change the name and focal point to make it more child appropriate.  Cat Up a Tree  A book of poetry by Isaacs focuses on what she considers a completely ordinary situation: a cat stuck in a tree. The story unfolds one poem at a time, presenting different characters, all of whom think they know best what to do with the cat. The fireman and cat- catcher, a little girl, a wary robin, and an overzealous mayor, among others, all have their point of view on what to do with the cat and whether it even needs catching.  Torn Thread  Based on the true story of her mother-in- law, Isaacs writes a story about Eva. In 1943, in Poland, the life of 12-year- old Eva turns when her sick sister is seized by the Nazis in a raid on the Jewish ghetto. In an effort to save both of his daughters, their father sends Eva to join her sister in a Nazi labor camp, where the girls are used as child labor to spin thread on machinery to make blankets for the German army. As she struggles amid ever-worsening conditions to save her life and that of her sick sister, Eva overcomes many struggles, including the lack of clothing and food. These two teenagers strive to create home and family for each other amidst the inhumanity and chaos that made up Nazi Germany. The book has been awarded with the Outstanding International Book, Notable Book for a Global Society 2000, American Library Association: Notable Book, Best Books for Young Adults, 2000, National Jewish Book Award Finalist, Booklist: Best of the Year‚ÄîHolocaust Literature for Youth, 2000, New York Public Library's 100 Titles for Reading and Sharing, 2000, Sydney Taylor Honor Book, Notable Book for Young Readers Pick of the Lists, American Booksellers Association, Smithsonian Notable Book for Children, and the Children's Literature Choice Book.  Pancakes for Supper  Pancakes for Supper features little blonde-haired Toby. When her family's wagon hits a bump, Toby Littlewood is hurled into the sky and lands in a forest. There, she meets a porcupine, a bear, and a hungry cougar, among other fearsome creatures. Cleverly, she talks each one out of eating her by offering up her fancy clothes. In the end, in a competition to be the grandest beast, the vain animals chase each other around and around a maple tree, where they turn into maple syrup that she eats on her pancakes for supper. The story is a folksy storytelling offering a twist to The Story of Little Black Sambo.  The Ghosts of Luckless Gulch  The Ghosts of Luckless Gulch (Atheneum Books, 2008) takes place at the cusp of the California Gold Rush in 1848. Estrella, a Latina, can run so fast she burns up the air, and can leave a trail of flames wherever she runs on her father's rancho north of San Francisco. Her pets‚Äîa Kickle Snifter, a Sidehill Wowser, and a Rubberado puppy‚Äîare based on 19th-century tall tales and Pourquoi stories, or origin myths. Estrella has the power to heal them, along with wild animals she encounters. When the Ghosts of Luckless Gulch steal her pets, and come up with a sure-fire plan to steal all the gold in California, Estrella finds the need to use her powers to save the day for the hapless miners and her pets. Isaacs was living in Petaluma, California, while she wrote this book, near Rancho Petaluma Adobe, the former home of General Mariano Vallejo, now the last remaining \\"rancho\\" house and a state historic park. The Petaluma Adobe provided her with a model home for Estrella. The Vallejo family became the model for Estrella's family. The State Historic Parks District Interpretation library and the UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library provided many historic details regarding Northern California landscape and life during the early years of the Gold Rush. The towns, supplies, prices, and most of the settings were all historically researched by Isaacs.  Dust Devil  Isaacs and Zelinsky completed a sequel to Swamp Angel more than 15 years later, Dust Devil, published by Schwartz & Wade in 2010. Swamp Angel has a reputation as the greatest woodswoman in all of Tennessee. But when she grows too big for that state, she moves to Montana. It's there that she wrestles a raging storm to the ground and, at its center, finds herself a sidekick‚Äîa horse she names Dust Devil. And when Backward Bart, an outlaw, starts terrorizing the prairie, Angel and Dust Devil are the only ones strong enough to stop him.\\"Review of the Day: Dust Devil by Anne Isaacs\\". Elizabeth Bird.

The English were led by Francis Drake. The raid was part of his Great Expedition to the Spanish New World. The English soldiers then occupied the city for over two months and captured much booty along with a ransom before departing on 12 April. Origins War had already been unofficially declared by Philip II of Spain after the Treaty of Nonsuch in which Elizabeth I had offered her support to the rebellious Protestant Dutch rebels. The Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World in a kind of preemptive strike. Sailing from Plymouth, England, he struck first at Santiago in November 1585 then sailed across the Atlantic on New Years Day 1586 to the Spanish New world city of Santo Domingo in the Caribbean, which was captured, plundered, and a 25,000-ducat ransom extorted. Drake, having raided Cartagena harbor a decade before, decided this important place was the next target. A map of Drake's voyage to the Spanish Main Preparations Governor Don Pedro Fernandez de Busto had been warned from a vessel that had sailed fast from the recently sacked city of Santo Domingo that his city would be next. He decided that all value was to be transported inland, while the city itself was evacuated of all non-combatants. Don Pedro Fernandez called for reinforcements from other nearby settlements and the militia of Cartagena was mustered and defences were prepared. The English fleet after leaving Santo Domingo sailed parallel along the New Granadan coast towards Cartagena. Drake knew that the coast was a treacherous one and a dangerous place to land sailors let alone soldiers.Bradley pp. 95‚Äì97 Cartagena de Indias Cartagena lay on the coast and it was well protected from an attack on its seaward side. Between Cartagena and the mainland, a seawater-filled moat had been dug, crossed by the fortified bridge of San Francisco. To the east swampland separated the city from the jungle-clad hills of the mainland. The city itself lay on the base of a narrow S-shaped spit of sand called La Caleta, which divided the Outer Harbour from the Caribbean, and which ended at the Boca Grande Channel. De Busto decided to concentrate the bulk of his forces on La Caleta and ordered a line of entrenchments laced with sand-filled wine barrels to be built, to protect the city behind him which was virtually defenceless. Defences The naval defenses of Cartagena included two well- armed galleys crewed by a total of 300 men under the direct command of Don Pedro Vique y Manrique who also doubled as the governor's military advisor. He was assisted by his two subordinates, Captain Juan de Castaneda in the Santiago and Captain Martin Gonzales in the Ocasi√≥n, and a galleass which, although unseaworthy, was anchored in the harbour for support. These galleys would give supporting fire on La Caleta which was covered by the earthworks. On land a stone-built fort, El Boqueron with eight guns, was garrisoned by about 200 men under Captain Pedro Mexia Mirabel and guarded the passage to the Inner Harbour. The main defence consisted of a force of up to 570 regulars and militia which protected the city itself (100 of them being pikemen), supported by a troop of 54 mounted lancers under the command of Captain Francisco de Carvajal, and a unit of as many as 300 Indian allies, equipped with bows and poisoned arrows. These were supported by a handful of Spanish regulars who served as officers and instructors. Battle Drake appeared off Cartagena during the afternoon of 9 February 1586 and as the Boca Grande passage was unfortified, his ships passed through it in a long column, with the Elizabeth Bonaventure in the lead. The English ships dropped anchor at the northern end of the Outer Harbour after sailing past the entrance, just beyond the range of the Spanish guns guarding the Boqueron Channel. Drake sent Martin Frobisher forward to probe the defences using small boats and pinnaces in the afternoon. Coming in by way of Bah√≠a de las Animas they moved forward but they soon ran into a chain of floating barrels which closed their way and in addition intense fire from El Boqueron forced their eventual withdrawal. Drake concurred with Christopher Carleil commander of the English troops that the best chance of capturing the city was by advancing up La Caleta. An English officer of Pikemen Landing Just before midnight on 9 February, the troops clambered into boats, and they were rowed across the Boca Grande Channel to a beach on the southern end of La Caleta. A few hours later on the next day almost 1,000 English soldiers and sailors were landed safely after Spanish sentries were surprised and killed.Corbett pp. 43‚Äì54 Drake and the Tudor Navy: With a History of the Rise of England as a Maritime Power, Volume 2 They also avoided the poisoned-tip stakes which the Spanish had put up. The English troops formed themselves up into attack columns and by wading through the surf as the tide was out they were able to bypass the outer defences; Drake meanwhile organized a naval diversion. Assault As the English moved to the Spanish positions a battery of four heavy guns covered the approaches, and Carleill could see the two Spanish galleys moving into position. At least 300 Spanish militia and 200 Indian allies lined the defences. The galleys began to open fire, joined by the defenders of the earthwork. Seeing the Spanish galleys firing too high, Carleill gave the order to charge, yelling 'God and St George!' and after some fighting in which the English pikemen pushed forward, they stormed the seaward end of the defences. Some of the English columns attacked the earthworks from the flank, rolling up the defences as they went. Any defenders were cut down where they stood, and the Spanish now routed fled into the city. Carleill and his men soon clambered over the city walls again pushing aside the defenders and they were now inside the city. They pursued the Spanish through the darkened streets and then were in the central plaza itself.Bradford, Ernie Drake: England's Greatest Seafarer Here the English reformed and then spread out into the city, pockets of resistance left were dealt with after they used the captured Spanish guns on their former users. The rest fled over the San Francisco bridge along with De Bustos but the battle was still not yet won. Present-day walls of old Cartagena de las Indias Spanish collapse Meanwhile, the two galleys and the galleass defending the Inner Harbour, and Captain Mirabel's garrison of El Boquer√≥n were still in action. Don Pedro Vique on board the Santiago immediately drew in to the beach and landed at the head of a troop of cavalry, carried on board as a mobile striking force. The English however repelled this and Vique was unable to prevent the rout, and he and his men were forced back to their boats. Meanwhile, after the collapse of the defences, Captain Castaneda of the Santiago tried to support the defenders of the San Francisco bridge by landing troops. Most of his men simply joined the rout after the English threatened to cut them off, and he was then forced to beach his galley under the guns of El Boqueron, and was set alight. Captain Gonzalez of the Ocasion tried to cross the boom and escape into the Outer Harbour, but panic ensued after English cannon fire set the galley on fire and was also beached beneath El Boquer√≥n. The Spanish from the galleys managed to flee along with their galley slaves; the static galleass was captured intact as English soldiers managed to surround it. The fort of El Boquer√≥n was the only Spanish defense still intact and this was bombarded from La Caleta and by the English ships which still lay in the Boquer√≥n channel. Captain Pedro Mexia Mirabel and his defenders however slipped away the following night, which meant that by dawn on 11 February the city and some of its surroundings were in English hands. English sailors also managed to capture six ships that remained in the Inner Harbor the same day and the battle was over. Results Casualties were light on both sides; Carleill's soldiers had lost only 28 men, although at least 50 more had been wounded. Spanish losses were even less - a mere nine men killed with another 35 wounded. Drake had captured nearly 250 Spanish including many important men of the city, one of which was Alonso Bravo a Spanish captain who had surrendered in the town marketplace. Drake had captured more than sixty guns, and he immediately ordered his carpenters and gunners to repair their carriages, and to emplace them where they could to cover the landward approaches to the city. The Spanish galleass had been captured and the remains of the charred galleys on the beach were stripped of anything valuable.  Occupation  Drake established his headquarters in the house of the wounded Alonso Bravo and he planned to hold the city until he could negotiate a ransom. Before he could do so, however, and despite Drake's orders to avoid looting, the English soldiers ran amok, ransacking houses and churches until Drake and his officers were able to get them under control. Drake then began by demanding ransoms from his prisoners, including Alonso Bravo; the two actually became friends and allowed Bravo to visit his dying wife. Drake's feeling of compassion eventually decided to decrease his ransom to just 600 pesos.Joy Paige, Francis Drake post 1580 Ransom Formal negotiations began on 15 February and Governor Don Pedro Fern√°ndez was summoned to Drake's quarters, accompanied by his leading negotiator Father Don Juan de Montalvo, his deputy governor Don Diego Daca, and Tristan de Oribe Salazar, one of the city's leading merchants. As he had at Santo Domingo, Drake began by demanding a hugely inflated ransom of 400,000 pesos. The Spanish said they were willing to pay up to 25,000. The negotiations were getting nowhere and frustration now led Drake to repeat his tactic from Santo Domingo, and so parts of the city were set on fire. Over a period of time 250 houses or public buildings were destroyed before the Spanish reluctantly offered a compromise, and a deal was finally reached. Drake was offered 107,000 pesos in return for sparing the rest of the city. Drake and his men also managed to extort all the smaller individual payments from the rest of the Spanish prisoners, of the kind he had demanded of Alonso Bravo. A total of 250,000 pesos was brought in, the majority of which had been gleaned from the Church. Drake accepted the governor's offer, and so for several days mule trains carrying silver and gold guarded by the English soldiers arrived in the town plaza.  End  On 27 February, Drake called for a council of war to decide what to do with the city. One suggestion was that Cartagena should be held by the English, and turned into a permanent English settlement in the heart of the Spanish New World. However they all agreed that the English crown would not tolerate the huge finance that would be involved. It was agreed that with a fever spreading rapidly and the ransom now completed it was decided to abandon the city as soon as the ransom was collected. The English took whatever remaining goods they could, which could be sold for a profit on the voyage home. He embarked around 500 slaves, took whatever guns he could fit into his ships, leaving Cartagena virtually defenceless. The official plunder was set at 107,000 pesos, while the private plunder was as much as 357,000 'pieces-of-eight' and the value of the guns, church bells, and other goods, meant that a respectable haul of 500,000 pesos was acquired.  Aftermath  'Drake house' in Cartagena; Drake used this as his headquarters during the brief occupation in 1586 Drake finally sailed from the city on 12 April, after spending two months in Cartagena. The New Year Gift, a Spanish ship captured by Drake at Santo Domingo was abandoned, the vessel being sunk in the Boca Grande anchorage. Two days later a Spanish fleet arrived, sent from Seville to trap Drake but they were too late. Behind them the Spanish had to explain the debacle to their King and Don Pedro Fern√°ndez de Busto wrote: I do not know how to begin to tell your Highness of my misfortune ... I can only say that it must be God's punishment for my sins, and for those of others. The bulk of the official ransom had been paid using royal funds and it would take years for the city to repay the treasury, and to recover from the raid. Meanwhile, its defenses had to be rebuilt, its buildings repaired, and its citizens had to recover from the assault, disease, and financial ruin. Drake went on further to successfully attack the Spanish settlement of St. Augustine in May and then went on to find Sir Walter Raleigh's settlement much further North at Roanoke. Drake had become a name that reverberated around the Spanish Americas.  Legacy  The popular cocktail drink of the mojito has its origins as a result of this raid. With fever becoming a problem amongst the English ships, Drake wanted a solution. After leaving Cartagena and sailing northwards a small boarding party went ashore on Cuba and came back with ingredients for a medicine which was effective, and so became known as El Draque. On June 9, the Spanish record in a document that when looking for Drake they found evidence that a small English party had landed 5 days earlier on 4 June. This is when they would have gathered the ingredients for the cocktail.The 1st Cocktail, Invented 1586 Was A Medicinal Crude Rum Mix (Article 34)  See also  * Battle of Santo Domingo (1586) * Raid on St. Augustine * Battle of San Juan (1595) * Battle of Cartagena de Indias References ;Citations Bibliography   ;External links * History: Pauline's Pirates & Privateers: The First Sack of Cartagena * The Caribbean Raid, 1585‚Äì1586 * The Assault of Drake * Maratos, David.

The double-time protein is a kinase that phosphorylates PER protein that regulates the molecularly-driven, biological clock controlling circadian rhythm. The mammalian homolog of doubletime is casein kinase I epsilon. Different mutations in the dbt gene have been shown to cause lengthening, shortening, or complete loss in period of locomotor activity in flies. Drosophila and certain vertebrate Casein Kinase Id shows circadian function that has been evolutionary conserved over long time spans.  Discovery  Double time gene (dbt) was first identified and characterized in 1998 by Michael Young and his team at The Rockefeller University. Young's research group, headed by Jeffrey Price, published their results in a paper which characterized three alleles of dbt in fruit flies. They discovered that two mutant alleles, named short and long (dbts and dbtl, respectively) that were able to alter normal cycling of per and tim. Young's team suspected that the delay between the rise in mRNA levels of per and tim and the rise of PER and TIM protein were due to the effects of another protein. Young suspected that this protein postponed the intercellular accumulation of PER protein by destroying it. Only when PER was paired with TIM was this break-down not possible. This work showed that DBT regulated the break-down of PER. Young named the novel gene double-time (dbt) due to its effect on the normal period of Drosophila. Mutant flies which only expressed dbts had an 18-hour period while those expressing dbtl had a 28-hour period. In addition, Young's team isolated a third allele, dbtp' which caused lethality in pupa while ablating any per or tim products in larvae. dbtp mutants were important because they provided clues as to how the gene product functioned. Without functional DBT protein, flies accumulated high levels of PER and these PER proteins do not disintegrate in the absence of pairing with TIM protein. These mutants expressed higher cytosolic levels of PER than cells in which PER protein was associated with TIM protein. The double-time gene regulates the expression of PER which in turns controls circadian rhythm. Young's team later cloned the dbt gene and found that the DBT protein was a kinase which specifically phosphorylated PER proteins. Thus, in dbt mutants, PER proteins were not phosphorylated by DBT protein.  Gene  The gene is located on the right arm of chromosome 3. The mRNA transcript of dbt is 3.2 kilo-base pairs long, and it contains four exons and three introns.  Protein  The DBT protein is composed of 440 amino acids. The protein has an ATP binding site, a serine/threoine kinase catalytic domains, and several potential phosphorylation sites, including a site for autophosphorylation.  Function   Regulation of circadian rhythm  In Drosophila, a molecularly-driven clock mechanism works to regulate circadian rhythms such as locomotor activity and eclosion by oscillating the levels of the proteins PER and TIM via positive and negative feedback loops. The doubletime gene produces the protein DBT, a kinase that phosphorylates PER to regulate its accumulation in the cytoplasm and its degradation in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, PER and TIM levels rise during the night, and DBT binds to PER while levels of TIM are still low. DBT phosphorylates the cytoplasmic PER, which leads to its degradation. Only once TIM accumulates do PER and TIM bind, and this binding inhibits the degradation of PER. This cytoplasmic PER degradation and then accumulation causes the 4-6 hour delay seen between the levels of per mRNA and the levels of PER protein. The PER/TIM complex, still bound to DBT, migrates into the nucleus where it suppresses the transcription of per and tim. TIM is lost from the complex, and DBT then phosphorylates PER which leads to its degradation, allowing for the transcription of the clock and clock-controlled genes (those with transcription controlled by circadian mechanisms). The oscillations in the PER and TIM proteins presence causes oscillations in their own and other genes' expression, which is the basis for circadian rhythmicity. The transcription of dbt mRNA and the levels of the DBT protein are consistent throughout the day and not controlled by PER/TIM levels. However, the location and concentration of DBT protein within the cell changes throughout the day. It is consistently present in the nucleus at varying levels, but in the cytoplasm it is predominantly present in the late day and early night, when PER and TIM levels are peaking Before DBT begins phosphorylating PER, a different protein called NEMO/NLK kinase begins phosphorylating PER at its per-short domain. This phosphorylation stimulates DBT to begin phosphorylating PER at multiple nearby sites. In total, there are about 25-30 phosphorylation sites on PER. The phosphorylated PER binds to the F-box protein SLIMB, and it is then targeted for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Therefore, the phosphorylation of PER by DBT leads to a decrease in PER abundance, which is a necessary step in the function of the organism's internal clock. The activity of DBT on PER is aided by the activity of the proteins CKII and SGG, and it is antagonized by a rhythmically expressed protein phosphatase. It is possible, but currently unknown, if DBT regulates other functions of PER or of other circadian proteins. There has been no evidence that suggests that DBT binds directly to TIM. Rather, the only kinase known to directly phosphorylate TIM is the SHAGGY (SGG) kinase protein, but this does not majorly affect TIM stability, suggesting the presence of a different kinase or phosphatase. DBT does play a role in recruiting other kinases into PER repression complexes. These kinases phosphorylate the transcription factor CLK, which releases the CLK-CYC complex from the E-Box and represses transcription.  Mutant alleles  There are three primary mutant alleles of dbt: dbtS, which shortens the organism's free-running period (its internal period in constant light conditions); dbtL, which lengthens the free-running period; and dbtP, which causes pupal lethality and eliminates circadian cycling proteins and per and tim transcription. All mutants except for dbtS produce differential PER degradation that directly correspond with their phenotypic behavior. DbtS PER degradation resembles wild-type DBT, which suggests that dbtS does not affect the clock through this degradation mechanism. It has been suggested that dbtS works by acting as a repressor or producing a different phosphoylation pattern of the substrate. DbtS causes early termination of per transcription. The dbtL mutation causes the period of PER and TIM oscillations, as well as animal behavioral activity, to lengthen to about 27 hours. This extended rhythm is caused by a decreased rate of phosphorylation of PER due to lower DBT kinase activity levels. This mutation is caused by a substitution in the protein sequence (Met-80‚ÜíIle mutation). The dbtS mutation causes a PER/TIM oscillation period of 18‚Äì20 hours. There is no current evidence for the mechanism affected by the mutation, but it is caused by a substitution in the protein sequence (Pro-47‚Üí Ser mutation). Another dbt mutation is dbtAR, which causes arrhythmic activities in Drosophila. It a hypermorphic allele that is the result of a His 126‚ÜíTyr mutation. Homozygous flies with this mutation are viable but arrhythmic, whereas dbtAR/+ heterozygotes have extra-long periods of about 29 hours, and their DBT kinase activity is reduced to the lowest rate of all of the DBT alleles.  Noncircadian  Clock gene mutations, including those to Drosophila's dbt, alter the sensitization of drug-induced locomotor activity after repeated exposure to psychostimulants. Drosophila with mutant alleles of dbt failed to display locomotor sensitization in response to repeated cocaine exposure. Additionally, there is experimental evidence for this gene to function in 13 unique biological processes, including biological regulation, phosphorus metabolic process, establishment of planar polarity, positive regulation of biological process, cellular process, single-organism developmental process, response to stimulus, response to organic substance, sensory organ development, macromolecule modification, growth, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and rhythmic process. The gene's alternative name, discs overgrown, refers to its role as a cell growth regulating gene that has strong effects of cell survival and growth control in imaginal discs, an attribute of the larvae fly stage. The protein is necessary in the mechanism linking cell survival during proliferation and growth arrest.  Noncatalytic  The DBT protein may play a noncatalytic role in attracting kinases that phosphorylate CLOCK (CLK), an activator of transcription. DBT has a noncatalytic role in recruiting kinases, some of which have not yet been discovered, into the transcription translation feedback loop (TTFL). DBT's catalytic activity is not affiliated with the phosphorylation CLK or its transcriptional repression. PER phosphorylation by DBT is integral in repressing CLK-dependent transcription. The DBT protein plays a noncatalytic role in recruiting additional kinases that phosphorylate CLK indirectly, thus downregulating transcription. A similar pathway exists in mammals due to the mechanistic conservation of the CKI homolog. In 2004, In dbts and dbtl mutants, Drosphila cells has reduced CKI-7 activity.  Mammalian homologs   Casein kinase I  The casein kinase 1 (CKI) family of kinases is a highly conserved group of proteins that are found in organisms from Arabidopsis, to Drosophila, to humans. Because dbt is a member of this family, questions arose about the role of these related genes in other model systems. Within mammals, there are seven CKI isoforms, all with various roles surrounding the phosphorylation of proteins. CKIŒµ was found to be most homologous to dbt, with a similarity of 86%. Along with this genetic similarity, the proteins have been found to be functionally homologous. Just as phosphorylation by dbt in Drosophila targets PER proteins for proteasome degradation, CKIŒµ phosphorylation reduces the stability of mammalian PER proteins, labeling them for degradation. However, while dbt and CKIŒµ do play similar roles in their respective organisms, studies looking at the effectiveness of CKIŒµ in Drosophila have shown that they are not completely functionally interchangeable. Nonetheless, the functions are extremely similar. Specifically, CKIŒµ has been shown to reduce the half-life of mPER1, one of the three mammalian PER homologs. In addition, nuclear localization of the mPER proteins is related to phosphorylation, adding another essential role to the activity of the CKIŒµ protein. Overall, the genetic similarity of dbt and CKIŒµ is not the end of the story; the roles they play within the circadian clock in their respective systems are almost identical. Both are involved with periodic phosphorylation, regulating the oscillations of the circadian clocks.  Role of CKIŒµ  Initially, the role of CKIŒµ within the circadian clock of mammals was discovered as the result of a mutation in hamsters. The tau mutation in the Syrian golden hamster was the first to show a heritable abnormality of circadian rhythms in mammals. Hamsters with the mutation exhibit a shorter period than the wild-type. Heterozygotes have a period of about 22h while the period of homozygotes is even shorter, at about 20h. Because of previous research indicating the role of dbt in establishing period, the tau mutation was found to be at the same locus as the CKIŒµ gene. Thus, this mutation relates to the mutations dbtS and dbtL, which both effect the internal period of the fly. However, it seems that the forces driving these changes in period are different. It was found that the point mutation resulting in the tau mutant decreased the activity of the CKIŒµ kinase in vitro. In flies, on the other hand, the dbtL mutation is associated with a decrease in dbt activity and a longer period. This is consistent with another experiment done on hamsters that showed a lengthening of the period caused by CKI inhibition. To investigate this discrepancy, researchers studied the half- life of PER2 under the influence of wild-type CKIŒµ, CKIŒµtau, and CKIŒµ (K38A) which is a kinase-inactive mutant. The results indicated that the tau mutation was actually a gain-of-function mutation, instead of loss-of-function, that caused the more rapid degradation of the PER proteins. Therefore, the tau mutation in hamsters can be seen as similar to mutations in dbt that change the internal period.  Importance of rhythmic phosphorylation  A role of CKIŒµ has also been seen in humans related to Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome, in which individuals have a much shorter period than the typical human. In this case, it does not seem to be a mutation of the CKIŒµ protein itself, but instead in the binding site for phosphorylation of the PER2 protein. In addition, kinase activity has been shown to be involved in the nuclear localization of PER and other genes involved in circadian rhythmicity. Therefore, it is this phosphorylation that allows PER to repress its own transcription and place a delay on the circadian system. Without the phosphorylation of PER, by dbt in Drosophila or by CKIŒµ in mammals, there would be no oscillations because the feedback loop would be broken. It has even been proposed that this rhythmic phosphorylation itself might be a driving factor of circadian clocks. Up to this point, the transcription- translation negative feedback loop has been identified as the source of oscillations and rhythms in biological clocks. But, experiments with phosphorylation of the cyanobacterial protein KaiC in vitro showed that rhythms persisted without the presence of any transcription or translation. Therefore, kinases like dbt and CKIŒµ might play even more important roles within circadian clocks than just targeting proteins for degradation.

It debuted in 1978, and was exhibited by Rede Globo until 2014. The program is still aired on Futura, TV Cultura, TV Brasil, TV Aparecida, and Rede Vida. The idea of this program was created by journalist Francisco Calazans Fernandes and it featured several kinds of education classes.G1 - Novo Telecurso ter√° aulas de filosofia, teatro e sociologia Broadcast history Educational programming began to be broadcast by Rede Globo on 16 January 1978 when the secondary-school oriented Telecurso 2o Grau started broadcasting; it was initially created by Rede Globo in conjunction with the Funda√ß√£o Padre Anchieta and the Roberto Marinho Foundation. Unlike almost all other programs shown by Rede Globo, the program was presented commercial-free for its entire run due to its educational nature, although promos for the network's shows and public service announcements were still shown in between segments of the program. In 1981, Telecurso was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes with the launch of Telecurso 1o Grau, which concentrated on educational lessons for elementary school children. In 1986, the Roberto Marinho Foundation retitled the original program as Novo Telecurso 2o Grau and a new partnership was obtained with Bradesco; the courses featured were authorized to become a valid form of educative material in schools around Brazil, as well as in certain companies. On 2 January 1995, the entire educational programming block was rebranded as Telecurso 2000 and expanded to 45 minutes with the launch of Telecurso 2000 Profissionalizante (which focused on vocational subjects). On 31 March 2008, the program was reformatted as Novo Telecurso, which removed outdated segments of geography and history that were no longer being used and replaced them with philosophy, visual arts, music, theatre, sociology, and Spanish language topics that were aimed at secondary students who have not completed their education. In 2009, a new partnership was attained with SENAI-SP for the vocational segments of the program. On 28 November 2014, Telecurso aired for the last time on Rede Globo. It was replaced by Hora Um da Not√≠cia, an early- morning news program that premiered on 1 December 2014. The daily edition of Globo Rural aired the last time on the same day; the weekly edition currently airs on Sundays at 8:00 am.

Washington was born in 1838 near Charles Town, Virginia, in present-day West Virginia. She was the daughter of William Temple Washington, through whom she was a great-grandniece of George Washington, first President of the United States, and a grandniece of Dolley Payne Todd Madison. Following her family's relocation to Stafford County, she and her family witnessed the Battle of Fredericksburg first hand during the American Civil War. Due to her family's limited financial resources after the war and her father's illness, Washington accepted a position as a clerk within the United States Post Office Department in Washington, D.C., to support her family. There, Washington was one of the four co-founders of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (with Mary Desha, Mary Smith Lockwood, and Ellen Hardin Walworth). Washington had reportedly been inspired by her experiences during the American Civil War to found an organization for preserving the shared heritage of women from the North and South of the United States. Washington was the DAR's first Registrar General, and was made \\"number one\\" on the \\"grand roll\\" of the society's membership. In 1898, Washington founded another lineage society, the National Society of Daughters of the Founders and Patriots of America, with the broader goal of preserving the history of the American colonial era. While visiting a relative in Louisiana around 1870, Washington attended a Roman Catholic mission. She later converted to Roman Catholicism from her Episcopal faith, after which she became a prominent lecturer of the Catholic faith. Washington never married, and she died in 1900. Washington was interred beside her mother at the Moncure family burial ground of her sister's estate, \\"Glencairne,\\" in Falmouth, Virginia. Early life, family, and ancestry Eugenia Scholay Washington was born on June 27, 1838, at \\"Megwillie\\" plantation near Charles Town in Jefferson County, Virginia (now West Virginia), to William Temple Washington (1800‚Äì1877) and his wife, Margaret Calhoun Fletcher (1805‚Äì1865). The name of the plantation on which she was born, \\"Megwillie,\\" was a portmanteau of both her mother and father's nicknames. Through her father, Washington was the granddaughter of George Steptoe Washington (1771‚Äì1809) and Lucy Payne Washington Todd (1772?‚Äì1846). She was also the great-granddaughter of Samuel Washington (1734‚Äì1781, younger brother of George Washington) and his wife Annie Steptoe, and the great- grandniece of George Washington (1732‚Äì1799). Her grandfather, George Steptoe Washington, was a \\"favorite nephew\\" of George Washington and was left an inheritance following Washington's death. Washington's grandmother, Lucy Payne Washington Todd, was a sister of First Lady of the United States Dolley Payne Todd Madison (1768‚Äì1849). The widowed Dolley Payne Todd married James Madison at Washington's grandparents' residence, Harewood. Through her mother, Washington was great-grandniece of John C. Calhoun (1782‚Äì1850). Also through her mother, Washington was descended from Charles Francois Joseph, Count de Flechir (born in France in 1755, died in New York in 1815), who served in the American Revolutionary War and was \\"a friend and kinsman\\" of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. Count de Flechir married Ruth Phillips Sourency. Flechir's grandson and Washington's grandfather, Thomas Fletcher, served on the staff of General William Henry Harrison in the War of 1812. Thomas Fletcher married Nancy McIlhenney and was the son of Samuel Fletcher and Abigail West. Washington's father, William Temple Washington, was educated at the College of William & Mary and home schooled his children. Around 1859, William Washington relocated his family to a plantation at Falmouth in Stafford County, Virginia, located on the north side of the Rappahannock River across from Fredericksburg. Washington's father suffered from paralysis, and she cared for him from a young age. American Civil War Following her family's relocation to Falmouth, Washington continued to live a \\"tranquil life\\" caring for her father until the American Civil War. Union and Confederate forces fought near the family plantation, so Washington and her family \\"suffered all the horrors and the hardships\\" of the war. The family witnessed the Battle of Fredericksburg, December 11‚Äì15, 1862, first hand. A wounded Union Army officer was brought to their home early in the battle and placed in Washington's care while waiting a surgeon, thus delaying the evacuation of Washington and her disabled father. As the battle drew even nearer, Washington \\"sheltered her father's body with her own\\" in a trench created by a cannon, and they remained in that position for an entire day. By the end of the American Civil War, Washington and her family were \\"deprived of all worldly goods\\". Washington's mother, Margaret, died shortly after the war's conclusion in 1865, and her father, William Temple, died twelve years later in 1877.  United States Post Office Department  After her mother's death, Washington accepted a position as a clerk within the United States Post Office Department in Washington, D.C., to support herself and her ailing father. Eva Bryan, former president of the Daughters of Founders and Patriots of America, considered Washington's position an \\"honorable\\" one for a woman, because of the family's financial straits, although otherwise \\"the great- great-niece of George Washington would not normally be employed.\\" Washington and her father relocated from Falmouth to Washington in 1867, and she lived there until her death in 1900. During her tenure with the Post Office, Washington was known as \\"Miss Eugie\\" and \\"considered quite attractive and always received a great deal of attention wherever she went\\". During her last decade, Washington served as a clerk in the Dead letter office.  Daughters of the American Revolution  National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution Washington was one of the four co-founders of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (with Mary Desha, Mary Smith Lockwood, and Ellen Hardin Walworth). The organization's founders emulated the Sons of the American Revolution, founded in New York City on April 30, 1889, which excluded women. According to society tradition, Washington's experiences during the American Civil War \\"inspired in her a will to assist women from both the North and the South in the worthy cause of preserving their shared heritage\\". Washington and Desha consulted regularly with Sons of the American Revolution members for advice, particularly Registrar General Dr. George Brown Goode, Secretary General A. Howard Clark, William O. McDowell (SAR member #1), and Wilson L. Gill (secretary at the inaugural meeting). On October 11, 1890, at 2 pm, the 18 founding members and these four men met at the Stratford Arms in Washington, D.C., thus forming the Daughters of the American Revolution. Washington, Desha, Lockwood, and Walworth are called co-founders since they held two to three meetings in August 1890. Washington was the DAR's first Registrar General, and her name appears as member \\"number one\\" on the \\"grand roll\\" of membership. Washington also served as secretary general, vice president general, and in 1895 she became honorary vice president general, an office which she held until her death. Under Washington's leadership, the society raised funds for a national monument to Mary Ball Washington, mother of George Washington. Washington ardently carried out the duties of her offices at DAR, despite suffering with a serious eye condition that made it difficult for her to write. Washington stated, \\"We want a patriotic society founded on service and I will not become a member of an organization which is founded on rank and not on the service of the ancestors.\\" Daughters of Founders and Patriots of America Washington founded another lineage society, the National Society of Daughters of the Founders and Patriots of America, in June 1898. Washington established this organization with the broader goals of preserving the history of the American colonial era (like The Colonial Dames of America and The National Society of Colonial Dames of America), as well as encouraging appreciation of American history and fostering patriotism. Washington disliked the \\"bickering\\" within the DAR, and to ensure a more \\"congenial\\" society that \\"remained small and cordial\\", she required that the new organization members also be direct descendants of \\"a colonist who arrived in America between May 13, 1607 and May 13, 1687\\" as well as qualify for the DAR. Washington chose the deadline date of May 13, 1687 (broader than the Mayflower Society), so that she would be eligible for membership in the society. While Washington intended for the organization not to grow beyond 300 members, membership in the Daughters of Founders and Patriots of America grew to 2,800 by the mid-1980s.  Catholic faith  While visiting a family member in Louisiana around 1870, Washington attended a Catholic mission organized by the Paulists at a neighboring parish. After \\"careful study\\", Washington was received into the Roman Catholic Church. Prior to her conversion, Washington consulted with a clergyman at her Episcopal church, and in response to his concern, she replied: \\"Oh no, I must act up to my convictions and I shall pray hard that you may be given the same grace.\\" Washington became a prominent lecturer of the Catholic faith and attended the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C.  Later life and death  Washington never married. In 1892, Washington purchased a second residence at 5706 Berwyn Road in Berwyn Heights, Maryland, from James E. Waugh; she owned it until her death. While in Washington, D.C., she resided with her cousin Fanny Washington Finch at 813 13th Street, Northwest. Washington died at the age of 62 on Friday, November 30, 1900, at her home on 13th Street. Washington's housemate and cousin Fanny Washington Finch predeceased her in March of that year. Only \\"a few acquaintances\\" among Washington's colleagues and employees in her Post Office bureau knew she was ill, and she worked until a week before her death. Washington's sister, Jean Washington Moncure, also a resident of Washington and married to Thomas Gascoigne Moncure, arranged for Washington's funeral at her own house and interment next to their mother at the Moncure estate \\"Glencairne\\" on the Rappahannock River near Falmouth. On December 1, 1900, the funeral train left the Pennsylvania Railroad station in Washington, D.C., for Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Fredericksburg Betty Lewis Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution \\"escorted\\" Washington's remains. A simple graveside service was performed by Reverend Dr. Smith, pastor of St. George's Episcopal Church in Fredericksburg. A memorial service and requiem mass for Washington were held at St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Washington, D.C., on December 31, 1900. Following Washington's death, her sister Jean was the last surviving patrilineal descendant of William Temple Washington.  Legacy  The Founders of the Daughters of the American Revolution, a 1929 marble sculpture by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney honoring the society's four co-founders, including Washington. It is located alongside DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. By Washington's death in 1900, membership in the National Society of Daughters of the American Revolution numbered around 35,000. Many chapters of the society expressed their appreciation and respect. She was also mentioned at the groundbreaking of the Memorial Continental Hall on October 11, 1902, by Cornelia Cole Fairbanks. In 1908, a \\"mourning pin\\" crafted on the occasion of the death of George Washington that had been given to Washington by her grandmother, Lucy Payne Washington Todd, was donated to the Memorial Continental Hall by Jennie White Hopkins. On April 17, 1929, under the leadership of President General Grace L. H. Brosseau, the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated a memorial to its four founders, including Washington; it was sculpted by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and is located at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. The Daughters of the American Revolution also maintained Washington's gravesite at \\"Glencairne,\\" and in 1979 they installed a plaque honoring her. In October 1990, the Daughters of the American Revolution held a ceremony at her gravesite to mark the centennial jubilee of the organization's founding. On October 13, 1999, a year after their own centennial, 21 members of the Daughters of Founders and Patriots of America met at the gravesite to unveil a larger memorial plaque honoring her.

It existed as a railroad until it was merged into its parent company, Consolidated Rail Corp., on May 31, 1984.  History   Creation and Development  By 1905 many of the prime industrial locations in the City of Detroit located on railroad lines were already taken, causing an impediment to the development of the automotive and other industries being created at that time. Detroit Terminal Railroad's trackage extended around the City of Detroit in what is called a \\"belt line,\\" reaching rural undeveloped locations in order to open up opportunities for new industrial development in the rapidly growing city. Originally planned but never accomplished was a railroad-operated \\"car ferry\\" operation to sail the Detroit River to distribute freight at the many docks located along the river that were inaccessible to railway shipping.The Detroit News, August 27, 1904, \\"An Outer Belt Line,\\" p. 3 Originally capitalized by local Detroit business owners desiring railway access to their businesses,The Detroit News, December 8, 1905, \\"Incorporate New Belt Line Today\\" the first section of the Detroit Terminal Railroad was completed from a location on the Detroit River east of downtown Detroit north approximately four miles to a connection with the Michigan Central Railroad and Grand Trunk Western Railroad known as Milwaukee Junction. Soon afterwards Detroit Terminal Railroad was purchased jointly by Michigan Central Railroad (25%), Grand Trunk Western Railroad (50%) and Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway (25%), all having railroad lines in Detroit. Detroit Terminal Railroad's route was extended in sections by its new owners according to its original plans as a belt line until it owned and operated 18 miles of main line trackage from the Detroit River on the east side of town to the Michigan Central mainline located on the west side of town by 1914. Total investment at this point was US$1.5 million. Detroit Terminal was operated as an independent organization from its owning railroads including having its own business offices and employees.Detroit Free Press, June 28, 1914 \\"Completion of Last Section of Detroit Terminal Railway Increases its Importance in Development of Industry\\" Soon after completion in 1914, Detroit Terminal Railroad was exceeding its capacity in freight business and began to double track its entire route and adding signalling for control of train movements. In 1914 about 75,000 loaded freight cars were delivered to or originating from about 50 important industries served by the railroad. These industries included many of the automotive manufacturers of the time including the Chalmers Motor Company, the Hudson Motor Company, Continental Motor Company and Ford Motor Company. Ford's Highland Park Plant at this time was the largest shipper on the railroad shipping 176 outbound freight cars daily containing automobiles and up to 100 freight cars daily bringing in supplies and materials to build the cars. When Ford completed its huge River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan Detroit Terminal Railroad's western extension was completed to service it providing Ford with the benefits of having a terminal railroad to connect with all the other railroads in Detroit for routing its freight.Pinkepank, Jerry A., Trackside Around Detroit Downriver 1946-1976, Morning Sun Books, 2004, p. 9 The interest of Michigan Central, Grand Trunk Western and Lake Shore & Michigan Southern railroads in owning the Detroit Terminal Railroad was not only for accessing newly developed industrial sites located outside of downtown Detroit for industrial development serviced by rail but to also allow the better interchanging of freight cars between the three owner railroads and with all the other railroads in Detroit. As Detroit Terminal Railroad had physical connections with the other major Detroit railroads, Pere Marquette Railroad, the Wabash Railroad and the Detroit, Toledo & Ironton, this provided its owner railroads with these interchange connections. By handling the transfer of interchange business over the Detroit Terminal Railroad the freight classification yards on the other railroads in Detroit were relieved and the handling of local business was also facilitated by using Detroit Terminal Railroad to distribute freight to the industries located on its line.  Growth and Decline  Freight movement on the Detroit Terminal Railroad steadily increased up to 1950 fed largely by the development, growth and maturation of the automotive industry in Detroit. Business remained stable throughout the 1950s then slowly started dropping off starting in the 1960s. By 1968 the alarm bells were ringing at Detroit Terminal Railroad's business offices as carloadings had dropped dramatically from a peak of 151,914 in 1953 to 57,543 in 1967. This was a result of changing ways of urban living (natural gas to heat homes instead of railroad-hauled coal) to the closing of major automotive plants in Detroit (DeSoto and Hudson) and also due to the use of large, hi-capacity (\\"hi-cube\\" and \\"autorack\\") freight cars especially by the automotive companies replacing two or three smaller freight cars needed before. Revenue per freight car moved almost doubled between 1953 and 1967 but operating expenses per freight car moved tripled in this period. Employment drop from 358 in 1953 to 227 in 1967 and salaries took up 98% of operating revenue in 1967. In 1967 there was an estimated $2.5 million in deferred maintenance to tracks and equipment. Blame was placed on poor management of the railroad by its two railroad owners (Michigan Central and Lake Shore & Michigan Southern had merged into the New York Central by this time) who were not paying enough attention to the railroad. Also \\"deteriorating social conditions\\" culminating in the 1967 race riots in Detroit at the time were causing an exodus of industries located on the railroad further reducing carloadings.Memo prepared by Detroit Terminal Railroad Management, 1968, \\"Analysis of Detroit Terminal\\"  Operations  The main freight yard of the Detroit Terminal was its Davison Yard located in northern Detroit at Davison and Mound Roads located about in the middle of the belt line's route. All freight cars came and went through Davison Yard where they were classified for the various trains to take the freight cars to the on-line industries or the connecting railroads for interchange. Additional lesser freight yards on Detroit Terminal Railroad included East Warren Yard, Mack Yard and Van Dyke Yard, all located east of Davison Yard, and West Warren Yard and Lonyo Yard all located west of Davison Yard. Interchanges were with New York Central Railroad (later Penn Central then Conrail) at their Livernois Yard until 1974 then afterwards at North Yard, Grand Trunk Western at their East Yard, Pere Marquette (later Chesapeake & Ohio then CSX) at their Rougemere Yard, Detroit Toledo & Ironton (before owned by Grand Trunk Western) at their Ford Yard, Pennsylvania Railroad (before merger with New York Central) and Wabash (later N&W;) at \\"Oakman Spur\\" at Lonyo Avenue by West Warren Yard.Babbish, Byron C., 2004, \\"The Last Days of the Detroit Terminal Railroad.\\" The Semaphore, Grand Trunk Western Historical Society Newsletter, Vol 2 Issue 4, p. 8, Winter 2004 Detroit Terminal Railroad EMD NW2 #105 was just recently rebuilt and repainted in this February 15, 1981 photograph taken at the railroad's Davison Freight Yard in Detroit, Michigan USA  Locomotives  Locomotives used by the Detroit Terminal Railroad in the era of steam locomotives were 0-6-0 and 0-8-0 type switch locomotives. Starting in 1945 Detroit Terminal Railroad began replacing its steam locomotives with diesel-electric locomotives. It purchased its first two diesel locomotives from Baldwin Locomotive Company in 1945, numbers 101 and 102, both models VO-1000, followed by #103, a DS44-1000 in 1947. It completed dieselization in 1947 with the purchase of nine model NW2 diesel switchers from Electro-Motive Division of General Motors, numbers 104 through 112. It purchased two more NW2 model switchers in 1949 (numbers 114 and 115) and purchased its final locomotive in 1951 with an EMD SW7 model switcher, number 116.\\"Detroit Terminal Railroad All Time Diesel Roster,\\" Grand Trunk Western Historical Society  The End of Detroit Terminal Railroad  By the late 1970s on-line business had rapidly declined on the Detroit Terminal Railroad. With railroad consolidation occurring in Detroit as well as nationwide the use of the Detroit Terminal Railroad for the interchange purposes of its two owners had also declined and in 1980 Grand Trunk Western sold its 50% interest in Detroit Terminal Railroad to its other owner, Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Conrail operated it for a year then, in August 1981, combined Detroit Terminal Railroad operations with its own railroad operations out of its North Yard in Detroit. Over the next couple years Conrail cut back on operating the former Detroit Terminal Railroad trackage and eventually stopped operating over its west end (which, for a while, it accessed from its Livernois Yard at a newly reinstalled connecting track). Today Conrail (Shared Assets) still runs daily trains over what was the east end of the Detroit Terminal Railroad to service a Jeep manufacturing plant owned by Chrysler Group LLC. On May 31, 1984 Conrail legally merged Detroit Terminal Railroad into itself, officially ending 79 years of continuous operation by Detroit's only terminal railroad.

The last to arrive at Naibalebale was those from Yalobi and Nadi- Vacai. A living testimony within Viwa is that there is no other Yavu near Naibalebale rather than Yawalevu and Viwa is a qali of Waya and not Naviti. The island has its own primary school and nursing station. The islanders are facing transport problem as they do not have any consistent transport service to their island.

Established in 2012, RIC has nearly 50 departments which provide health facilities to several parts of the country. The hospital was established by Punjab Health Department and inaugurated by former Chief Minister of the Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif. A 272-bed hospital, the current executive director is Senior Interventional Cardiologist Major-General Azhar Mahmood Kayani; the medical superintendent of the hospital is Dr. Qais. History In October 2005, the establishment of Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology (RIC) was approved by the CM Punjab Chaudhry Parvez Elahi government of the Punjab. At the cost of Rs.2.75 billion, the construction was started in June 2010. The then-Chief Minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, said that the project would be completed within a year, although shortage of funds meant that this timescale was not met. According to Hanif Abbasi ‚Äì a former Pakistan Muslim League-N Member of the National Assembly ‚Äì the provincial government provided Rs.100 million for the project. The Chief Minister then announced that RIC would be inaugurated by 14 August 2012, but once again the deadline was missed due to the delay in installation of the equipment. Medical Superintendent of the RIC Dr. Shoaib Khan told \\"that the project had not been delayed but the health department had delayed the inauguration function due to Ramazan and some important engagements of the chief minister.\\" Departments and staff RIC started functioning from September 2012 with the help of Rawalpindi Medical College's (RMC) administration, treating 21 patients in the outpatient department (OPD). Shahbaz Sharif inaugurated the hospital officially on 15 September. RIC is the first hospital in Rawalpindi Division which consists of modern 48-beds emergency department, 26 medical ventilators and five CT angiography machines. The hospital also includes 24-beds Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 14-beds Coronary care unit (CCU) and four operation theatres (OT). A free of cost state of the art centre for cardiac surgery, paediatric cardiology and surgery, angiography and radiology will treat the patients of Potohar region, northern areas and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

They were armed with two twin .50 calibre M2 Browning machine guns mounted either side of the bridge. The crew comprised one officer in command, a coxswain, two engineers, two seamen and one or two radio operators. Service history Air Faith was one of a class of twenty boats ordered on 4 March 1944. They were all Model 314 boats, designed by the Miami Shipbuilding Corporation, of Miami, Florida, but built at a number of shipyards in California. Air Faith was built by South Coast Company in Newport Beach, California, as hull C-26647 and arrived at Sydney aboard the Cecil G. Sellars and was commissioned on 8 February 1945. Air Faith was placed into reserve on 20 August 1946, and in 1949 she was one of thirteen RAN rescue boats transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force, and renamed 02-101. The boat was returned to the RAN in 1965, and sold to private interests on 3 July 1968. The boat was sold again in 1972 and has been with the current owner ever since. The boat is moored in Sydney Harbour and has been operating as a charter vessel since 1998. The boat has had major modifications, but the hull is clearly visible as its former air sea rescue style. A superstructure was fitted as a saloon area in the 1980s. The Hall Scott petrol engines were replaced in the 1970s with GM's, and recently with Fiat diesels.

It is the boyhood home of Major League Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller. The historic district is . The Feller family farm was once but most of it has been sold to other farmers and the current farm is . Feller sold the farmstead in 1955 and it is currently owned by Dr. Jose Angel since about 1994.  Background  Baseball signed by Bob Feller The farmstead was first purchased by the Feller family on January 5, 1866, by Feller's grandparents, Andrew and Elizabeth Feller. Andrew had immigrated from Germany and Elizabeth from Switzerland. Feller was born on the farm in November 1918. Feller learned to pitch here on the farmstead from his father William Andrew Feller, known as Bill. When Feller was 8 years old, he threw a baseball so hard it broke three of his father's ribs. In 1932 his father, Bill, built a ballfield one-quarter mile east of the farmhouse; complete with some bleachers and a concession stand. This ballfield has been called the \\"original Field of Dreams\\". This ballfield and its homefield baseball team were named Oakview because of all the oak trees in the area. Oakview is no longer part of the farm and has been plowed under and overgrown. Bill Feller even switched his corn fields to wheat because the earlier harvest of wheat allowed his son more time to play baseball. Feller's Major League debut season was 1936, as a 17-year-old, with the Cleveland Indians. The New York Times soon said his name was \\"on the tongues of a million fans\\". He then appeared on the cover of Time on April 13, 1937. Feller once stated that if he could relive any moment of his life it would be \\"Playing catch with my dad between the red barn and the house.\\" The Raccoon River is about one mile south of the property.  Red barn  The farmstead's red barn was built in 1886 by Andrew Feller, Bob's grandfather, and still stands as of 2020. Feller's proclivity for baseball was first noticed at age five. The place where Bill Feller taught his son Bob to pitch is southwest of the barn and between the barn and house. The pitching rubber is no longer present but the terrain is unaltered and it remains part of the farmstead. During the winter they would practice inside the barn. The barn had wood shingles and board-and-batten siding with a heavy timber frame with pegged joints.  House  The original house was replaced by a brick home that Feller had built during 1939‚Äì1940 for his parents, William Andrew and Lena C. Feller, and sister, Marguerite E. Feller Goodson. The architect of the house was John Normile of Des Moines, Iowa. Normile primarily used the Tudor Revival style for the house. Feller paid the then-large sum of $75,000 for the house and it has only had slight modifications since its 1940 completion, except for a breakfast nook and an addition on either side. There are five bedrooms and four bathrooms. Fellers parents lived there until they died, Bill in 1943 of brain cancer and Lena of lung cancer in 1954. There is also a loafing shed on the property that was built in the early 20th century with wooden sides and a metal roof. The new house was built northwest of the old house, which was moved to another site in the region.

Mariners have had rules of thumb regarding the navigation around tropical cyclones for many years, dividing a storm into halves and sailing through the normally weaker and more navigable half of their circulation. Marine weather forecasts by various weather organizations can be traced back to the sinking of the Royal Charter in 1859 and the RMS Titanic in 1912. The wind is the driving force of weather at sea, as wind generates local wind waves, long ocean swells, and its flow around the subtropical ridge helps maintain warm water currents such as the Gulf Stream. The importance of weather over the ocean during World War II led to delayed or secret weather reports, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Weather ships were established by various nations during World War II for forecasting purposes, and were maintained through 1985 to help with transoceanic plane navigation. Voluntary observations from ships, weather buoys, weather satellites, and numerical weather prediction have been used to diagnose and help forecast weather over the Earth's ocean areas. Since the 1960s, numerical weather prediction's role over the Earth's seas has taken a greater role in the forecast process. Weather elements such as sea state, surface winds, tide levels, and sea surface temperature are tackled by organizations tasked with forecasting weather over open oceans and seas. Currently, the Japan Meteorological Agency, the United States National Weather Service, and the United Kingdom Met Office create marine weather forecasts for the Northern Hemisphere. History Royal Charter. There are various origins for government-issued marine weather forecasts, generally following maritime disasters. Great Britain In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450 people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom Met Office's primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office had begun issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following World War I, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during World War II between 1939 and 1945. United States RMS Titanic departing Southampton on 10 April 1912 The first attempt as a marine weather program within the United States was initiated in New Orleans, Louisiana by the United States Army Signal Corps. A January 23, 1873 memo directed the New Orleans Signal Observer to transcribe meteorological data from the ship logs of those arriving in port. Marine forecasting responsibility transferred from the United States Navy to the Weather Bureau in 1904, which enabled the receipt of timely observations from ships at sea. The sinking of RMS Titanic in 1912 played a pivotal role in marine weather forecasting globally. In response to that tragedy, an international commission was formed to determine requirements for safer ocean voyages. In 1914, the commission's work resulted in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. In 1957, in order to help address marine issues, the United States Weather Bureau started to publish the Mariners Weather Log bi-monthly publication to report past weather conditions primarily over Northern Hemisphere oceans, information regarding the globe's tropical cyclone seasons, to publish monthly climatologies for use of those at sea, and to encourage voluntary ship observations from vessels at sea. Within the United States National Weather Service (NWS), forecast weather maps began to be published by offices in New York City, San Francisco, and Honolulu for public use. North Atlantic forecasts were shifted from a closed United States Navy endeavor to a National Weather Service product suite via radiofacsimile in 1971, while northeast Pacific forecasts became publicly available by the same method in 1972. Between 1986 and 1989, the portion of the National Meteorological Center (NMC) known as the Ocean Products Center (OPC) was responsible for marine weather forecasting within the NWS. Between August 1989 and 1995, the unit named the Marine Forecast Branch also was involved in providing objective analysis and forecast products for marine and oceanographic variables. The Marine Prediction Center, later renamed the Ocean Prediction Center, assumed the U.S. obligation to issue warnings and forecasts for portions of the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans once it was created in 1995.

Because of conservation of potential vorticity caused by the poleward-moving winds on the subtropical ridge's western periphery and the increased relative vorticity of northward moving water, transport is balanced by a narrow, accelerating poleward current, which flows along the western boundary of the ocean basin, outweighing the effects of friction with the western boundary current known as the Labrador current. The conservation of potential vorticity also causes bends along the Gulf Stream, which occasionally break off due to a shift in the Gulf Stream's position, forming separate warm and cold eddies.Maurice L. Schwartz (2005). Encyclopedia of Coastal Science. Springer, p. 1037. . Retrieved on 2009-05-07.

Swell dispersion and wave groups  North Pacific storm waves as seen from the NOAA M/V Noble Star, Winter 1989. Swells are often created by storms long distances away from the beach where they break, and the propagation of the longest swells is only limited by shorelines. For example, swells generated in the Indian Ocean have been recorded in California after more than half a round-the-world trip.Directional recording of swell from distant storms, W. H. Munk, G. R. Miller, F. E. Snodgrass, and N. F. Barber, 1963: Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. London A 255, 505 This distance allows the waves comprising the swells to be better sorted and free of chop as they travel toward the coast. Waves generated by storm winds have the same speed and will group together and travel with each other, while others moving at even a fraction of a metre per second slower will lag behind, ultimately arriving many hours later due to the distance covered. The time of propagation from the source t is proportional to the distance X divided by the wave period T. In deep water it is t = 4 \\\\pi X /( g T) where g is the acceleration of gravity. As an example, for a storm located away, swells with a period T=15 s will arrive 10 days after the storm, followed by 14 s swells another 17 hours later. This dispersive arrivals of swells, long periods first with a reduction in the peak wave period over time, can be used to tell the distance at which swells were generated. Whereas the sea state in the storm has a frequency spectrum with more or less always the same shape (i.e. a well defined peak with dominant frequencies within plus or minus 7% of the peak), the swell spectra are more and more narrow, sometimes as 2% or less, as waves disperse further and further away. The result is that wave groups (called sets by surfers) can have a large number of waves. From about seven waves per group in the storm, this rises to 20 and more in swells from very distant storms. Sailing ship journeys Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water. Tropical cyclone avoidance The dangerous semicircle is the upper-right corner, with the arrow marking the direction of motion of a Northern Hemisphere storm. Mariners have a way to safely navigate around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm. The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.The Pennsylvania State University.

The 1-2-3 rule (mariners' 1-2-3 rule or danger area) is a guideline commonly taught to mariners for severe storm (specifically hurricane and tropical storm) tracking and prediction. It refers to the rounded long-term National Hurricane Center forecast errors of 100-200-300 nautical miles at 24-48-72 hours, respectively. However, these errors have decreased to near 50-100-150 as NHC forecasters become more accurate with tropical cyclone track forecasting. The \\"danger area\\" to be avoided is constructed by expanding the forecast path by a radius equal to the respective hundreds of miles plus the forecast wind radii (size of the storm at those hours).Central Pacific Hurricane Center.

Two areas of high waves are identified: One west of the southern tip of Greenland, and the other in the North Sea. Calm seas are forecast for the Gulf of Mexico. Wind barbs show the expected wind strengths and directions at regularly spaced intervals over the North Atlantic. The transfer of energy between the wind blowing over the surface of an ocean and the ocean's upper layer is an important element in wave dynamics. The spectral wave transport equation is used to describe the change in wave spectrum over changing topography. It simulates wave generation, wave movement (propagation within a fluid), wave shoaling, refraction, energy transfer between waves, and wave dissipation. Since surface winds are the primary forcing mechanism in the spectral wave transport equation, ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from the atmosphere into the layer at the surface of the ocean. Along with dissipation of energy through whitecaps and resonance between waves, surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of the state of the sea surface. The first ocean wave models were developed in the 1960s and 1970s. These models had the tendency to overestimate the role of wind in wave development and underplayed wave interactions. A lack of knowledge concerning how waves interacted among each other, assumptions regarding a maximum wave height, and deficiencies in computer power limited the performance of the models. After experiments were performed in 1968, 1969, and 1973, wind input from the Earth's atmosphere was weighted more accurately in the predictions. A second generation of models was developed in the 1980s, but they could not realistically model swell nor depict wind-driven waves (also known as wind waves) caused by rapidly changing wind fields, such as those within tropical cyclones. This caused the development of a third generation of wave models from 1988 onward. Within this third generation of models, the spectral wave transport equation is used to describe the change in wave spectrum over changing topography. It simulates wave generation, wave movement (propagation within a fluid), wave shoaling, refraction, energy transfer between waves, and wave dissipation. Since surface winds are the primary forcing mechanism in the spectral wave transport equation, ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from the atmosphere into the layer at the surface of the ocean. Along with dissipation of energy through whitecaps and resonance between waves, surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of the state of the sea surface. Observing platforms Weather ships MS Polarfront at sea. The idea of a stationary weather ship was proposed as early as 1921 by M√©t√©o-France to help support shipping and the coming of transatlantic aviation. Established during World War II, a weather ship, or ocean weather vessel, was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were used during World War II but had no means of defense, which led to the loss of several ships and many lives. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science. The establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) had established a global network of 13 weather ships by 1948, with seven operated by the United States, one operated jointly by the United States and Canada, two supplied by the United Kingdom, one maintained by France, one a joint venture by the Netherlands and Belgium, and one shared by the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1985. Weather buoy operated by the NOAA National Data Buoy Center Weather buoys Weather buoys are instruments which collect weather and ocean data within the world's oceans, as well as aid during emergency response to chemical spills, legal proceedings, and engineering design. Moored buoys have been in use since 1951, while drifting buoys have been used since 1972. Moored buoys are connected with the ocean bottom using either chains, nylon, or buoyant polypropylene. With the decline of the weather ship, they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean helped study the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation. Moored weather buoys range from to in diameter, while drifting buoys are smaller, with diameters of to . Drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number, with 1250 located worldwide. Wind data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships. There are differences in the values of sea surface temperature measurements between the two platforms as well, relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity. Weather satellites The first image obtained from the GOES 1 satellite, 1975 October 25, 1645 GMT. In use since 1960, the weather satellite is a type of satellite that is primarily used to monitor the weather and climate of the Earth. Satellites can be polar orbiting, covering the entire Earth asynchronously, or geostationary, hovering over the same spot on the equator.NESDIS. Satellites. Retrieved on July 4, 2008. Meteorological satellites see more than clouds and cloud systems. Beginning with the Nimbus 3 satellite in 1969, temperature information through the atmospheric column began to be retrieved by satellites from the eastern Atlantic and most of the Pacific Ocean, which led to significant forecast improvements. City lights, fires, effects of pollution, auroras, sand and dust storms, snow cover, ice mapping, boundaries of ocean currents, energy flows, etc., and other types of environmental information are collected using weather satellites. Other environmental satellites can detect changes in the Earth's vegetation, sea state, ocean color, and ice fields. El Ni√±o and its effects on weather are monitored daily from satellite images. Collectively, weather satellites flown by the U.S., Europe, India, China, Russia, and Japan provide nearly continuous observations for a global weather watch. Utility Commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed, wave periodicity and heights, tides, and precipitation. These factors can each influence the safety of marine transit. Consequently, a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio, for example the MAFOR (marine forecast).Great Lakes and Seaway Shipping. MAFOR Weather Code. Retrieved on 2008-05-27. Typical weather forecasts can be received at sea through the use of RTTY, Navtex and Radiofax. NCEP Products available Marine weather warnings and forecasts in print and prognostic chart formats are produced for up five days into the future. Forecasts in printed form include the High Seas Forecast, Offshore Marine Forecasts, and Coastal Waters Forecasts. To help shorten the length of the forecast products, single words and phrases are used to describe areas out at sea. Experimental gridded significant wave height forecasts began being produced by the Ocean Prediction Center in 2006, a first step toward digital marine service for high seas and offshore areas. Additional gridded products such as surface pressure and winds are under development. Recently, National Weather Service operational extratropical storm surge model output to provide experimental extratropical storm surge guidance for coastal weather forecast offices to assist them in coastal flood warning and forecast operations. Responsible organizations and their areas Northern Hemisphere Within the Japan Meteorological Agency, marine observatories are seated in Hakodate, Maizuru, Kobe and Nagasaki. These stations observe ocean waves, tide levels, sea surface temperature and ocean current etc. in the Northwestern Pacific basin, as well as the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk basin, and provide marine meteorological forecasts resulted from them, in cooperation with the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department, Japan Coast Guard. Within the United Kingdom, the Shipping Forecast is a BBC Radio broadcast of weather reports and forecasts for the seas around the coasts of the British Isles. It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast four times per day by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into sea areas, also known as weather areas.Met Office Shipping Forecast key The National Weather Service areas of marine weather forecasting responsibility Within the United States National Weather Service, the Ocean Prediction Center (OPC), established in 1995, is one of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction‚Äôs (NCEP's) original six service centers.

The OPC issues forecasts up to five days in advance for ocean areas north of 31 north latitude and west of 35 west longitude in the Atlantic, and across the northeast Pacific north of 30 north latitude and east of 160 east longitude. Until recently, the OPC provided forecast points for tropical cyclones north of 20 north latitude and east of the 60 west longitude to the National Hurricane Center. OPC is composed of two branches: the Ocean Forecast Branch and the Ocean Applications Branch. The National Hurricane Center covers marine areas south of the 31st parallel in the Atlantic and 30th parallel in the Pacific between the 35th meridian west and 140th meridian west longitude. The Honolulu Weather Service Forecast Office forecasts within the area between the 140th meridian west and the 160th meridian east, from the 30th parallel north down to equator.

Born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, the son of Reuben Rice Conn and Harriot Elizabeth, he became ill from rheumatic fever during his youth and had to be withdrawn from public school because of his poor health. Instead, he was educated at Cushing Academy, a private school in Ashburnham, Massachusetts, then matriculated to Boston University where he graduated second in his class with an A.B. in 1881. He entered graduate school at Johns Hopkins University in 1881, receiving his Ph.D. on animal morphology, physiology, and histology in 1884 with a thesis titled, \\"Life-history of Thalassema\\", for which he received a Walker prize from the Boston Society of Natural History. In August, 1885, he was married to Julia M. Joel; the couple had two children including Harold J. Conn, a soil bacteriologist and stain expert. Following his graduation, Conn joined the staff of Wesleyan University as a biology instructor, becoming a biology professor in 1887 and founder of the University's biology department. He would hold the chair of biology for the remainder of his career. The same year he was named acting director of the department of zoology at Martha's Vineyard Summer Institute. In 1889‚Äì90 he taught biology at Trinity College, then was director of the Cold Springs Biological Laboratory, today's Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, in 1890‚Äì97. Beginning in December, 1898, he helped to found the American Society for Microbiology; serving as its secretary for three years, then as its president in 1902. In 1901 he became a bacteriology lecturer at the Connecticut Agricultural College. He was chosen as the Connecticut State Bacteriologist in 1905, and helped to organize and direct the State Bacteriological Laboratory. In March 1911, the New York Milk Committee appointed him to be a member of the National Commission on Milk Standards. During his career, Conn published more than 150 papers, as well as a series of school textbooks. He is notable for discovering that typhoid fever can be distributed by oysters, and was a recognized specialist in the bacteriology of dairy products. Conn was a proponent of home economics, and his text Bacteria, Yeasts, and Moulds in the Home became a standard textbook in home economics courses. In addition to his work on bacteria and food safety, late in his career Conn also wrote against some of the theories of eugenics which were gaining popularity in the early 20th century. He argued that social factors must be taken into account when trying to understand human outcomes, and not merely genetics.

The film stars Kevin Costner, Amber Heard, Hailee Steinfeld, Connie Nielsen, Richard Sammel, and Eriq Ebouaney. The film was released on 21 February 2014. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $52.6 million against its $28 million budget. Plot American CIA agent Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner) works with a team to capture the Albino, the lieutenant to an arms trafficker (called the Wolf) who is selling a dirty bomb to terrorists in a hotel in Belgrade. The Albino deduces the trap when he recognizes one of Renner's fellow agents (disguised as a chambermaid), whom he kills. Renner, suddenly dizzy as he pursues The Albino, only manages to cripple him by shooting him in the leg, then blacks out, allowing the Albino to escape. Meanwhile, elite CIA assassin Vivi Delay (Amber Heard), a \\"Top Shelf agent\\", has been personally assigned by the Director to kill the Wolf. Vivi monitors the operation and suspects Renner has unknowingly seen the Wolf. Renner is nearly disabled by an extreme cough, which is diagnosed as terminal brain cancer that has spread to his lungs. He is given only a few months to live, and will not see the next Christmas. For decades he has kept his dangerous career a carefully guarded secret from his wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld), at the cost of losing them. He decides to spend his remaining time trying to fix his relationship with his estranged daughter, and if possible, his ex-wife. He returns to Paris, where he and his family live separately, to find the R√©union family of Jules is squatting in his apartment. He is told by the police that he is not permitted to evict indigent squatters until after the winter. He makes an awkward reconnection with Christine, and tells her of his terminal illness. She allows him to reconnect with Zooey, and when she has to go out of the country on business, she agrees to let him look after Zooey. Vivi recruits him to find and kill the Wolf, in exchange for an experimental drug that could extend his life significantly. Renner reluctantly accepts, to get more time with his family. Vivi tells him the way to trap the Wolf is by getting the Albino, in turn by getting his accountant, in turn by kidnapping the gang's limousine driver. All the while Renner is fighting the hallucinogenic effect of the medicine, which occurs whenever his heart rate goes too high, and which he can only control by consuming alcohol. He must also deal with Zooey's school problems, including her habit of lying so she can sneak out partying. He manages to keep her out of trouble, and slowly reestablishes a father relationship with her, which impresses his wife. He tracks the Wolf and the Albino into the subway, but they gain the upper hand when he is disabled by the hallucinations. The Albino attempts to kill him by pushing him in front of an oncoming train, but Renner manages to push the Albino on the track instead. The Wolf escapes, then contacts a business partner who can help him to flee the country. The family is invited to a party thrown by Zooey's boyfriend's father, who happens to be the Wolf's business partner. Renner manages to protect Christine and Zooey, kill all the Wolf's men, and trap the Wolf in an elevator before breaking the cables, causing the cabin to free-fall to the ground. The Wolf survives, severely injured, but Renner is again disabled and, also feeling guilty for all the damage his work has done to his family, he's suddenly unable to pull the trigger, and drops his gun where the Wolf can get it. Vivi intervenes and kicks the gun back to Renner, telling him to finish the job and kill the Wolf, but he decides not to, because \\"I promised my wife I'd quit.\\" Vivi then kills the Wolf. At last retired, Renner survives to Christmas, which he is spending at a beach house with Zooey and Christine. He discovers a small, red wrapped gift package, which contains another vial of the cancer medicine. Vivi is seen on a hill behind the house smiling as Renner opens the package.

The island lies south of the town of Kristiansund in the Nordm√∏re region of the county. The main villages on the island include Rensvik in the north, Kvalv√•g in the east, and Nedre Frei in the south. The island was part of the old Frei Municipality from 1838 until 2008 when the island was merged into Kristiansund Municipality. The Viking-era Battle of Rastarkalv, between Haakon I of Norway and the sons of Eric I of Norway, took place near the village of Nedre Frei in 955 AD.

A reverberator appears a result of a rupture in the front of a plane autowave. Such a rupture may occur, for example, via collision of the front with a nonexcitable obstacle. In this case, depending on the conditions, either of two phenomena may arise: a spiral wave, which rotates around the obstacle, or an autowave reverberator which rotates with its tip free.  Introduction  The reverberator was one of the first autowave solutions, researchers found, and, because of this historical context, it remains by nowadays the most studied autowave object. Up until the late 20th century, the term \\"auto-wave reverberator\\" was used very active and widely in the scientific literature, written by soviet authors, because of active developing these investigations in USSR (for more details, see \\"A brief history of autowave researches\\" in Autowave). And, inasmuch as the soviet scientific literature was very often republished in English translation (see e.g.), the term \\"autowave reverberator\\" became known also in English-speaking countries. The reverberator is often confused with another state of the active medium, which is similar to it, - with the spiral wave. Indeed, at a superficial glance, these two autowave solutions look almost identical. Moreover, the situation is further complicated by the fact that the spiral wave may under certain circumstances become the reverberator, and the reverberator may, on the contrary, become the spiral wave! However, it must be remembered that many features of rotating autowaves were quite thoroughly studied as long ago as the 1970s, and already at that time some significant differences in properties of a spiral wave and a reverberator were revealed. Unfortunately, all the detailed knowledge from those years remains now scattered in different publications of the 1970-1990s, which became little- known now even for the new generations of researchers, not to mention the people that are far from this research topic. Perhaps, the only book in that it were more or less completely brought together in the form of abstracts basic information about autowaves, known at the time of its publication, remains still the Proceedings ‚ÄûAutowave processes in systems with diffusion‚Äú, which was published in 1981 and became already a rare bibliographic edition in nowadays; its content was partially reiterated in another book in 2009. The differences between a reverberator and a spiral wave are considered below in detail. But for the beginning it is useful to demonstrate these differences with a simple analogy. Everyone knows well the seasons of a year... Under some conditions, winter can turn into summer, and summer, on the contrary, into winter; and, moreover, these miraculous transformations occur quite regularly! However, though a winter and a summer are similar, for example, in regular alternation of day and night, you cannot think of saying that winter and summer are the same thing, can you? Nearly the same things are with reverberator and spiral waves; and therefore they should not be confused. It is useful also to keep in mind that it is known now, in addition to the rotating-wave, quite a number of other autowave solutions, and every year the number grows continuously with increasing speed. Because of these causes (or as a result of these events), it was found during the 21st century that many of the conclusions about the properties of autowaves, - which were widely known among readers of the early papers on the subject as well as widely discussed in the press of that time, - unfortunately, proved to be a sort of erroneous hasty generalizations.  Basic information   \\"Historical\\" definition   On the question of terminology   Types of reverberator behaviour   The \\"classical\\" regimes  Various autowave regimes, such as plane waves or spiral waves can exist in an active media, but only under certain conditions on the medium properties. Using the FitzhHugh-Nagumo model for a generic active medium, Winfree constructed a diagram depicting the regions of parameter space in which the principle phenomena may be observed. Such diagrams are a common way of presenting the different dynamical regimes observed in both experimental and theoretical settings. They are sometimes called flower gardens since the paths traced by autowave tips may often resemble the petals of a flower. A flower garden for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is shown to the right. It contains: the line ‚àÇP, which confines the range of the model parameters under which impulses can propagate through one- dimensional medium, and plane autowaves can spread in the two-dimensional medium; the \\"rotor boundary\\" ‚àÇR, which confines the range of the parameters under which there can be the reverberators rotating around fixed cores (i.e. performing uniform circular rotation); the meander boundary ‚àÇM and the hyper- meander boundary ‚àÇC, which confine the areas where two-period and more complex (possibly chaotic) regimes can exist. Rotating autowaves with large cores exist only in the areas with parameters close to the boundary ‚àÇR. Similar autowave regimes were also obtained for the other models ‚Äî Beeler-Reuter model, Barkley model, Aliev-Panfilov model, Fenton-Karma model etc. It was also shown that these simple autowave regimes should be common to all active media because a system of differential equations of any complexity, which describes this or that active medium, can be always simplified to two equations. In the simplest case without drift (i.e., the regime of uniform circular rotation), the tip of a reverberator rotates around a fixed point along the circumference of a certain radius (the circular motion of the tip of the reverberator). The autowave cannot penetrate into the circle bounded by this circumference. As far as it approaches the centre of the reverberator rotation, the amplitude of the excitation pulse is reduced, and, at a relatively low excitability of the medium there is a region of finite size in the centre of reverberator, where the amplitude of the excitation pulse is zero (recall that we speak now about a homogeneous medium, for each point of which its properties are the same). This area of low amplitude in the centre of the reverberator is usually called the core of the reverberator. The existence of such a region in the center of reverberator seems, at first glance, quite incomprehensible, as it borders all the time with the excited sites. A detailed investigation of this phenomenon showed that resting area in the centre of reverberator remains of its normal excitability, and the existence of a quiescent region in the centre of the reverberator is related to the phenomenon of the critical curvature. In the case of \\"infinite\\" homogeneous medium, the core radius and the speed of the rotor rotation are determined only by the properties of the medium itself, rather than the initial conditions. The shape of the front of the rotating spiral wave in the distance from the centre of rotation is close to the evolvent of the circumference - the boundaries of its core. The certain size of the core of the reverberator is conditioned by that the excitation wave, which circulates in a closed path, should completely fit in this path without bumping into its own refractory tail. As the critical size of the reverberator, it is understood as the minimum size of the homogeneous medium in which the reverberator can exist indefinitely. For assessing the critical size of the reverberator one uses sometimes the size of its core, assuming that adjacent to the core region of the medium should be sufficient for the existence of sustainable re-entry. However, the quantitative study of the dependence of the reverberator behaviour on conductivity of rapid transmembrane current (that characterize the excitability of the medium), it was found that the critical size of the reverberator and the size its core are its different characteristics, and the critical size of the reverberator is much greater, in many cases, than the size of its core (i.e. reverberator dies, even the case, if its core fits easily in the boundaries of the medium and its drift is absent)  Regimes of induced drift  At meander and hyper-meander, the displacement of the center of autowave rotation (i.e. its drift) is influenced by the forces generated by the very same rotating autowave. However, in result of the scientific study of rotating autowaves was also identified a number of external conditions that force reverberator drift. It can be, for example, the heterogeneity of the active medium by any parameter. Perhaps, it is the works Biktasheva, where different types of the reverberator drift are currently represented the most completely (although there are other authors who are also involved in the study of drift of the autowave reverberator). In particular, Biktashev offers to distinguish the following types of reverberator drift in the active medium: # Resonant drift. # Inhomogeneity induced drift. # Anisotropy induced drift. # Boundary induced drift (see also). # Interaction of spirals. # High frequency induced drift. Note that even for such a simple question, what should be called a drift of autowaves, and what should not be called, there is still no agreement among researchers. Some researchers (mostly mathematicians) tends to consider as reverberator drift only those of its displacement, which occur under the influence of external events (and this view is determined exactly by the peculiarity of the mathematical approach to the study of autowaves). The other part of the researchers did not find significant differences between the spontaneous displacement of reverberator in result of the events generated by it itself, and its displacement as a result of external influences; and therefore these researchers tend to believe that meander and hyper-meander are also variants of drift, namely the spontaneous drift of the reverberator. There was not debate on this question of terminology in the scientific literature, but it can be found easily these features of describing the same phenomena by the different authors.  Autowave lacet  In the numerical study of reverberator using the Aliev- Panfilov model, the phenomenon of bifurcation memory was revealed, when the reverberator changes spontaneously its behaviour from meander to uniform circular rotation; this new regime was named autowave lacet. Briefly, spontaneous deceleration of the reverberator drift by the forces generated by the reverberator itself occurs during the autowave lacet, with the velocity of its drift decreasing gradually down to zero in the result. The regime meander thus degenerates into a simple uniform circular rotation. As already mentioned, this unusual process is related to phenomenon of bifurcation memory. When autowave lacet was discovered, the first question arose: Does the meander exist ever or the halt of the reverberator drift can be observed every time in all the cases, which are called meander, if the observation will be sufficiently long? The comparative quantitative analysis of the drift velocity of reverberator in the regimes of meander and lacet revealed a clear difference between these two types of evolution of the reverberator: while the drift velocity quickly goes to a stationary value during meander, a steady decrease in the drift velocity of the vortex can be observed during the lacet, in which can be clearly identified the phase of slow deceleration and phase of rapid deceleration of the drift velocity. The revealing of autowave lacet may be important for cardiology. It is known that reverberators show remarkable stability of their properties, they behave \\"at their discretion\\", and their behaviour can significantly affect only the events that occur near the tip of reverberator. The fact that the behaviour of the reverberator can significantly affected only by the events that occur near its core, results, for example, in the fact that, at a meeting with reverberator nonexcitability heterogeneity (e.g. small myocardial scar), the tip of the rotating wave \\"sticks\\" to this heterogeneity, and reverberator begins to rotate around the stationary nonexcitability obstacles. The transition from polymorphic to monomorphic tachycardia is observed on the ECG in such cases. This phenomenon is called the \\"anchoring\\" of spiral wave. However, it was found in the simulations that spontaneous transition of polymorphic tachycardia in monomorphic one can be observed also on the ECG during the autowave lacet; in other words, the lacet may be another mechanism of transformation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in a monomorphic. Thus, the autowave theory predicts the existence of special type of ventricular arrhythmias, conditionally called \\"lacetic\\", which cardiologists do not still distinguish in diagnostics.  The reasons for distinguishing between variants of rotating autowaves  Recall that from 1970th to the present time it is customary to distinguish three variants rotating autowaves: # wave in the ring, # spiral wave, # autowave reverberator. Dimensions of the core of reverberator is usually less than the minimal critical size of the circular path of circulation, which is associated with the phenomenon of critical curvature. In addition, the refractory period appears to be longer for the waves with non- zero curvature (reverberator and spiral wave) and begins to increase with decreasing the excitability of the medium before the refractory period for the plane waves (in the case of circular rotation). These and other significant differences between the reverberator and the circular rotation of excitation wave make us distinguish these two regimes of re-entry. The figure shows the differences found in the behavior of the plane autowave circulating in the ring and reverberator. You can see that, in the same local characteristics of the excitable medium (excitability, refractoriness, etc., given by the nonlinear member), there are significant quantitative differences between dependencies of the reverberator characteristics and characteristics of the regime of one-dimensional rotation of impulse, although respective dependencies match qualitatively.

Geography Heading near Midnight Mountain, about from Shishmaref Inlet, it flows into that inlet by a very sinuous course, from which character it receives its name. The bed rock of the Serpentine River Basin above the coastal gravel belt consists of dark graphitic and feldspathic mica-schists, which form Midnight Mountain, and of crystalline limestones and mica-schists of the Kugruk group. The relations of the dark schists to the limestones were not determined, though they are regarded as belonging to the Kugruk series. In the vicinity of the hot springs these dark schists have been intruded by extensive granite masses, forming a large area of granite. This granite outcrops in needles and pinnacles, produced by weathering along a double set of joints. ;Tributaries The Schlitz and Reindeer creeks flow northwestward into Serpentine River. Bryan Creek rises to the east of Kougarok Mountain and flows northeastward into Serpentine River. Quartz Creek is the name applied to the headwaters of the South Fork of Serpentine River.

McLennan was probably the first European to reach the hot springs on Spring Creek, a tributary of this river. He staked a number of claims along this creek, and prepared a map of the region, a copy of which was received in Washington in March, 1901. In September, 1901, there was a small settlement at the hot springs.

He was also the majority shareholder in Harris Tweed Hebrides, the primary producer of Harris Tweed cloth, which he helped to rescue in 2005. A philanthropist, mainly through his Taylor Family Foundation, he was a supporter of the performing arts as a force for social good. He was chairman of the board of trustees of the Royal Opera House, whose schools matin√©es programme, providing subsidised tickets for children from poor backgrounds, he was responsible for creating and funding. He was a supporter of the Rambert Dance Company, the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Royal Academy and the Vitruvian Group, of which he was a founder member. A long-term supporter of the Conservative Party, Taylor made donations to the Better Together campaign (for the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence) and to the Remain campaign (for the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the EU). In 2016 he was reported to have asked for his name to be withdrawn from consideration for a potential knighthood in David Cameron's resignation honours list; this was apparently in response to hostile media coverage. A regular participant in the Speakers for Schools initiative, Taylor was a founding shareholder of the British Americas Cup bid. The Sunday Times Rich List 2017 estimated Taylor's wealth at ¬£180 million. Early life The son of an ICI executive from Ayrshire, Taylor was born in Croydon, Surrey, and grew up in Manchester. For a brief period in his teens the family home was in Tehran, where Taylor's father worked for a while before the Iranian revolution of 1978‚Äì1979. Taylor was educated at King's School, Macclesfield (1968‚Äì1974) and then at Oxford University (1975‚Äì1978), where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Merton College. Career Ian Taylor at Vitol's Christmas party in 2010 Taylor joined Shell shortly after graduating in 1978. Within a year he had been sent to Venezuela as a trading representative. He also performed roles in operations and trading. In 1982 he became a crude and products trader, based in Singapore, before moving in 1985 to Vitol Group, a Dutch-owned energy and commodities company, with headquarters in Switzerland, which employs more than 5,440 people in 40 offices worldwide. Taylor spent seven years as a London-based manager for Vitol before moving back to Singapore as managing director of Vitol Asia in March 1992. He set up a global crude oil trading team and was involved in the formation of many international operations for the company. In June 1995 he was appointed CEO of Vitol Group, and held the position until March 2018, when he was replaced by Russell Hardy. The company has undergone considerable expansion and now trades more than 7 million barrels of crude oil and related products every day and ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil and products each year. With 2016 revenues of $152 billion, Vitol is the world's biggest independent oil trading company. In 2015 it was the world's ninth biggest corporation by revenue In addition to its trading activities, Vitol has stakes in five refineries worldwide, with a total refining capacity of 390,000 barrels a day, and has 15.9 million cubic metres of owned storage capacity. In 2013 Vitol purchased the Immingham Combined Heat and Power plant in Lincolnshire for an undisclosed price. The giant gas-power plant, subsequently valued at ¬£733m, is the company's only major UK operation. In addition to his work with Vitol, Taylor was a non-executive director at Fortune Oil PLC, a position he held beginning in 1996.

Today, the company has a staff of 80, as well as providing employment for 130 self-employed home-based weavers, and has a global customer-base that includes such brands as Chanel and J.Crew. In 2013 Harris Tweed Hebrides was named UKFT Textile Company of the Year, and in 2015 it was Scottish Exporter of the Year for 2015. It has also won awards for outstanding contribution to style and fashion. Philanthropy Vitol Foundation Vitol began making charitable grants in 2002, and in 2006 the Vitol Foundation was established, with Taylor as its first chairman. Its declared purpose is to enable children living in deprivation to escape the cycle of poverty and reach their potential in life. Vitol employees are encouraged to identify projects that could benefit from the Foundation's support.

These similarities are also reflected in their primary structure. In particular three well conserved regions are shared by SQS and PSY; they could be involved in substrate binding and/or the catalytic mechanism. SQS catalyzes the conversion of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into squalene. It is the first committed step in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The reaction carried out by SQS is catalyzed in two separate steps: the first is a head-to-head condensation of the two molecules of FPP to form presqualene diphosphate; this intermediate is then rearranged in a NADP-dependent reduction, to form squalene: 2 FPP -> presqualene diphosphate + NADP -> squalene SQS is found in eukaryotes. In yeast it is encoded by the ERG9 gene, in mammals by the FDFT1 gene. SQS is membrane-bound. PSY catalyzes the conversion of two molecules of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into phytoene. It is the second step in the biosynthesis of carotenoids from isopentenyl diphosphate. The reaction carried out by PSY is catalyzed in two separate steps: the first is a head-to-head condensation of the two molecules of GGPP to form prephytoene diphosphate; this intermediate is then rearranged to form phytoene. 2 GGPP -> prephytoene diphosphate -> phytoene PSY is found in all organisms that synthesize carotenoids: plants and photosynthetic bacteria as well as some non- photosynthetic bacteria and fungi.

Early life The granddaughter of slaves, Louise Shropshire was born Louise Jarrett on February 15, 1913 in Coffee County, Alabama. In 1917, her family relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio in search of a better life than they had experienced as rural Alabama sharecroppers. As a young girl, Louise demonstrated a gift for music and composed many hymns as a member of the African American Baptist Church. Sometime between 1932 and 1942, she composed a gospel hymn entitled \\"If My Jesus Wills\\". It wasn‚Äôt long until her music and talents were discovered. Singer and hymnwriter In 1935, she was discovered by Rev. Thomas A. Dorsey at the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses (NCGCC), an organization founded by Dorsey, which was held in Cincinnati that year. Dorsey, who is still considered the father of gospel music, was impressed by Louise‚Äôs talent as a composer and choir director and asked her to direct the mass choir segment of his convention. He also asked Shropshire to perform at the NCGCC with her family singing group, The Humble Three. Rev. Dorsey and Louise Shropshire would build a thirty-year friendship and together, co-wrote and copyrighted the gospel hymn, \\"Behold the Man of Galilee'\\". Some of Shopshire's other Gospel copyrighted compositions are \\"I've Got The Big Seal Of Approval\\"; \\"I'm Tryin' My Best To Get Home To See Jesus\\", \\"Whom Do Men Say That I Am?\\", \\"I Know Jesus Pilots Me\\". '\\"Are You Worthy to Take Communion\\", '\\"Come on, Jesus Will Save You Right Now\\", and \\"Mother's Beautiful Hands\\". Life and work In the early 1950s, Louise Shropshire met Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth. Finding much in common; Shropshire and King became good friends and established a strong and loyal spiritual alliance. Dr. King grew very comfortable with the Shropshire family and lodged at the Shropshire home when in Cincinnati. In addition, with the financial support of her husband‚Äôs successful bail bonds business, Shropshire held many fundraising events in her home and in Cincinnati hotels, several of which were attended by Dr. King himself. Funds were raised at these events to help bail out Civil Rights activists, who had been incarcerated during the Birmingham Campaign and Montgomery bus boycott. As a close friend of Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth and devout member of the African American Baptist Church, Louise Shropshire was instrumental in helping to establish the Greater New Light Baptist Church (GNLBC) in Cincinnati, Ohio. Following the unexpected death of her husband, Robert \\"Bob\\" Shropshire Sr. in 1967, Louise Shropshire moved to California to be with her convalescing mother, Ollie Johnson Jarrett. Soon afterwards, using her own financial resources, she planted a sister church in Pomona, California, to the GNLBC in Cincinnati. Both churches remain active to this day. Louise Shropshire died on November 26, 1993. The last words she spoke were to her grandson, Robert Anthony Goins Shropshire: \\"Someday, somebody‚Äôs gonna do something with all my music\\". In the years before her death, Louise Shropshire had taken more than 50 foster children into her home and was known never to deny a brother in need. Having exhausted her financial resources in the course of helping others, Louise Shropshire died penniless. \\"Louise Jarrett Shropshire\\", African American Registry. Retrieved 27 April 2016 In his 2012 book We Shall Overcome: Sacred Song on the Devil's Tongue, music producer Isaias Gamboa presented a theory suggesting that Shropshire's hymn \\"If My Jesus Wills\\" was the basis for the iconic protest song \\"We Shall Overcome\\", contrasting a more popular theory that linked the song to a hymn by Rev. Dr. Charles Albert Tindley, \\"I'll Overcome Some Day\\". In 2013, Shropshire was inducted into the Ohio Civil Rights Hall of Fame.

Murdock later decided to build higher and he proposed an 18-story tower that would be the city's tallest. Plans were finalized and approved during January 1959, and groundbreaking ceremonies were held on February 13, 1959. The actual excavation began February 16, 1959.

The glass facade on the north and south sides were divided into five sections by six vertical columns of precast concrete cladding that covered steel framework; of those, the two corner columns were slightly wider. The east and west sides were divided by five vertical concrete columns that extruded from the building dividing the face into four equal recessed sections. The outer sections had a windowless Mo-Sai stone curtain wall and the two middle sections had a glass curtain matching the north and south sides.\\"Building's Stonework Impresses\\" The Arizona Republican [Phoenix, Arizona] March 4, 1960 - Page 21 Remodeling In 1988 the building's exterior was remodeled and the light blue glass with white backing used as vertical dividers between floors was swapped for a tan non-glossy material.

Sportsbet is licensed as a corporate bookmaker in the Northern Territory under the Racing and Betting Act 1993 (NT). Sportsbet offers betting services online through its website and its mobile app (on IOS and Android) as well as by telephone, and has more than 1.25 million Australian customers as at the end of 2019. Sportsbet operates within the strict boundaries set by multiple Australian regulatory authorities at a federal and state level. This regulation involves varying restrictions on products and promotional activities that can be offered by licensed corporate bookmakers in Australia. The company was acquired by Paddy Power in December 2010, and since 2 February 2016, it has been owned by Flutter Entertainment plc. Flutter Entertainment plc (formerly Paddy Power Betfair plc) is a bookmaking business created by the merger of Paddy Power and Betfair. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It operates under various brands including Betfair, Paddy Power, Sportsbet, TVG and FanDuel. Sunday, March 29, 2020 History The business name Sportsbet Australia was first registered in 1994, with the Sportsbet.com.au domain name registered in 1999. In 2005, Matthew Tripp bought all shares of Sportsbet. In May 2009, 51% of Sportsbet.com.au was acquired by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power. The company would keep the name Sportsbet, and continue to be run as a separate entity while offering additional services. The takeover allowed Sportsbet.com.au to acquire rival betting company International All Sports Limited, for 27.2 million euros. In March 2011, Paddy Power took full ownership of Sportsbet.com.au, paying A$132.6 million for the remaining 39.2% share, which valued the entire company at A$338 million. Paddy Power and British rival Betfair agreed terms for a merger on 8 September 2015. The business is owned 52% by the former Paddy Power shareholders and 48% by the former Betfair shareholders.

Flutter was originally the name of a betting exchange acquired by Betfair in December 2001. The company stated that the rebrand, which took place on 28 May 2019, would not affect the company's individual customer facing gaming brands. In May 2020, the global merger between Flutter Entertainment and The Stars Group was finalised following regulatory and shareholder approvals. Sportsbet and BetEasy formed the Australian component of the merger. Incumbent CEO of Sportsbet Barni Evans was appointed to lead the combined Sportsbet and BetEasy businesses, with a decision made to move forward with the sole Sportsbet brand, retiring the BetEasy brand following a period of migration and integration.

All cognitive processes fall into one or both of those two categories. The amounts of \\"processing power\\", attention, and effort a process requires is the primary factor used to determine whether it's a controlled or an automatic process. An automatic process is capable of occurring without the need for attention, and the awareness of the initiation or operation of the process, and without drawing upon general processing resources or interfering with other concurrent thought processes. Put simply, an automatic process is unintentional, involuntary, effortless (not consumptive of limited processing capacity), and occurring outside awareness. Controlled processes are defined as a process that is under the flexible, intentional control of the individual, that he or she is consciously aware of, and that are effortful and constrained by the amount of attentional resources available at the moment. Characteristics Automatic processes When examining the label \\"automatic\\" in social psychology, we find that some processes are intended, and others require recent conscious and intentional processing of related information. Automatic processes are more complicated than people may think. Some examples of automatic processes include motor skills, implicit biases, procedural tasks, and priming. The tasks that are listed can be done without the need for conscious attention. Implicit biases are snap judgments that people make without being aware that they made them. An example of an implicit bias is when someone is walking down the street at night and they see a dark shadow of a person. The person might automatically cross the street or they might be scared of that individual. This is all done in a fraction of a second without the person even knowing they are making that judgment about the person. Priming is when a stimulus from the environment changes the way one someone reacts to another stimulus. An example of this is when someone sees a fast food sign and realizes they are hungry. This causes them to stop and get something to eat. That being said automatic effects fall into three classes: Those that occur prior to conscious awareness (preconscious); those that require some form of conscious processing but that produce an unintended outcome (postconscious); and those that require a specific type of intentional, goal directed processing (goal-dependent). Preconscious automaticity requires only the triggering proximal stimulus event, and occur prior to or in the absence of any conscious awareness of that event. Because they occur without our conscious awareness they are unnoticeable, uncontrollable, and nearly effortless. Many previous studies suggest that the mere perception of the physical behaviors of others, as well as abstract categories (race, gender, role-related) that occurs passively in person perception results in increased tendencies to behave in the same way oneself. So basically a stimulus may that be person, object, or an action will unconsciously affect one's response and or behavior without one's knowledge. In a study they subliminally exposed one of the participants with an African American face or a Caucasian face before the participants engaged in a verbal game. The study concluded that when participants were subliminally exposed to the African American faces they were significantly more aggressive in the verbal game than those exposed to the Caucasian face. In a study related to this the participants were required to play a video game that depicted a real- life situation that involved deciding to shoot a man with a gun. Participants were shown pictures of both Caucasian and African American men with or without a gun or another object in hand. The participants had to respond \\"Shoot\\" or \\"Not Shoot\\" within milliseconds. The results were that participants significantly decided to shoot faster when African Americans had a gun versus Caucasians. Postconscious automaticity depends on recent conscious experience for its occurrence. This postconscious influence on processing can be defined as the non-conscious consequences of conscious thought. The conscious experience may be intentional, or it may be unintentional, what is important is that the material be in awareness. Most things we are aware of are driven by the environment, and one does not intend or control the flood of these perceptual experiences, yet they still result in postconscious effects. In other words, we need to consciously engage in something and depending on the experience we will unconsciously think, and or behave a certain way. In the classic Bobo doll experiment a child watches a video of an adult acting aggressive towards a Bobo doll. Later when the child is put in the room with that same doll, the child was more likely to also engage in that act, versus children who didn't watch the video. In a study participants were primed with the stereotype of professors by being told to imagine a typical professor for 5 min and to list (a conscious act) the behaviors, lifestyle, and appearance attributes of this typical professor. After they were primed they had to perform a general knowledge task. The results were that the participants in the professor condition outperformed those in the control conditions (those not primed at all). Goal-dependent automaticity concerns skill and thought processes that require a goal to engage in them. This process is much similar to postconscious in that it requires conscious awareness to be initiated, but after that it can be guided outside of awareness by the unconscious mind. A good example would be driving a car: in order to drive a car, one needs to consciously have a goal to drive somewhere. When engaged in driving (only with enough practice) one can operate the car almost entirely without conscious awareness. However, more attentional control and decision making are needed when introduced to novel (reference) situations like driving through an unfamiliar town. The process needs to be learned enough that it can be automatic, requiring little conscious thought as to how to do it. Controlled processes One definition of a controlled process is an intentionally-initiated sequence of cognitive activities. In other words, when attention is required for a task, we are consciously aware and in control. Controlled processes require us to think about situations, evaluate and make decisions. An example would be reading this article. We are required to read and understand the concepts of these processes and it takes effort to think conceptually. Controlled processes are thought to be slower, since by definition they require effortful control; therefore, they generally cannot be conducted simultaneously with other controlled processes without task- switching or impaired performance. So the drawback of controlled processes is that humans are thought to have a limited capacity for overtly controlling behavior. Being tightly capacity-limited, controlled processing imposes considerable limitations on speed and the ability to have divided attention. Divided attention is the ability to switch between tasks. Some tasks are easier to perform with other tasks like talking and driving. Holding a conversation, however, becomes more difficult when traffic increases because of the need to focus more on driving than on talking. Forster and Lavie found that the ability to focus on a task is influenced by processing capacity and perceptual load. Processing capacity is the amount of incoming information a person can process or handle at one time. Perceptual load is how difficult the task is. A low load task is when one can think less about the task they are involved in. A high load task is when one needs to devot all their focus to the task. If they become distracted then they won't be able to accomplish the task. . In a study, participants were randomly assigned into two conditions, one requiring one task (small cognitive load) and one requiring two tasks (heavy cognitive load). In the one-task condition, participants were told that they would hear an anti- or pro-abortion speech and would have to diagnose the speaker's attitude toward abortion. The two-task condition had the same first assignment, but they were required to switch spots with the speaker and take their place after that. Even after being specifically told that they would be given further instructions at the next step, their cognitive load was affected in this study. Participants in the two-task condition performed more poorly than the one-task condition simply because they had the next task on their mind (they had extra cognitive load). Basically, the more tasks someone tries to manage at the same time, the more their performance will suffer. Processes with ambiguous categorization Some actions utilize a combination of automatic and controlled processes. One example is brushing your teeth. At any point, you could think about each tooth as you individually scrub them, but for the most part, the action is automatic. Another example is playing a musical instrument. After learning where your fingers should be placed and how to play certain notes you no longer have to think about what your fingers are doing. Your controlled process are then engaged in thinking about dynamics and intonation. Some processes can even start as controlled and become more automatic. Some cognitive processes are difficult to categorize as distinctly automatic or controlled, either because they contain components of both types of process or because the phenomena are difficult to define or observe. An example of the former is driving a car. An example of the latter is flow. Process of breathing, automatic, and controlled, easily observed. Flow Flow has been described as involving highly focused attention on the task at hand, loss of self-consciousness, and distorted time perception, among other cognitive characteristics. Some people report that during flow states they are less aware of autonomic responses such as hunger, fatigue, and discomfort. Some researchers hypothesize that because of this, some challenging tasks can counterintuitively require less effort to perform. Flow has been difficult to study, however, because it is difficult to produce in a controlled laboratory setting. Most experiments have relied heavily on correlating the presence of flow with various attributes of the task and the subjects' reported experiences. Of those correlations, subjects experiencing flow generally report that they perceive a good match between the task requirements and their skills (e.g. a professional basketball player in a professional basketball game.) Task structure and the clarity of the goal of the task are also thought to be related to when flow occurs. All of these aspects of flow imply that there must be an opportunity to suppress other controlled processes, as well as inhibit certain types of automatic processes. A study involving video game performance showed that flow in participants (determined based on a self-report survey of flow characteristics) strongly correlated with performance in the game. A related study attempted to inhibit and induce flow by biasing the moods of participants. The experimenters found that flow could be inhibited by a negative mood, but could not be induced by a positive mood. \\"A person does not need to be told to pay attention to a stimulus that captures attention quickly and effortlessly. In many cases, explicitly directing one's own or another's attention is necessary due to the presence of another stimulus that more easily captures attention. In the case of flow, however, an action that would normally grab one's attention is ignored, and many automatic processes are either suppressed (such as stimulus- driven attention changes) or ignored (such as discomfort.) On the other hand, situations in which autonomy is encroached upon (for example, if the individual must always control his/her actions to abide by rules imposed by the task) are thought to inhibit flow.Moller, A. C., Meier, B. P., & Wall, R. D. 2010. Developing an experimental induction of flow: Effortless action in the lab. In B. Bruya (Ed.), Effortless attention: A new perspective in the cognitive science of attention and action (pp. 191‚Äì204). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. This implies that another requirement of flow is to be free from constraints that force controlled processes to be used. Additionally, several areas of research indicate that during a state of flow an otherwise-controlled process becomes automatic allowing it to behave dominant over all other automatic processes.

History Elsam, a Danish power company, began looking at using biomass for the production of energy in the 1990s. The first pilot plant was opened in 2003, and it could process 2.4 metric tons of biomass/day. By 2005, the pilot plant was scaled up and could process 24 metric tons/day. Elsam, along with six other companies, merged to form DONG Energy, in 2006. In 2007, Inbicon was formed as a separate subsidiary of DONG Energy. The first Inbicon biomass refinery was opened at Kalundborg in 2009 and processed Danish wheat straw to second-generation fuel ethanol. The Inbicon refinery operated for five years demonstrating the efficacy of the technology and the process design obtaining a nameplate capacity commercial scale operation. The refinery marketed its low-carbon renewable liquid fuel to 99 Statoil stations in Denmark during that time. Inbicon. Our History. http://www.inbicon.com/about_inbicon/our%20history/pages/our%20history.aspx (Accessed Mar 31, 2013) After 5 years of operation DONG Energy, now √òrsted, considered the technology matured and ceased operation at the Inbicon Commercial Demonstration refinery. http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2015/04/01/inbicon-biofuels- digests-2015-5-minute-guide/https://ing.dk/artikel/dong-energy-lukker- bioethanol-anlaeg-i-kalundborg-172391 In August 2019, New Energy Blue, an American company whose founding partners and a US-based process engineering company, Applied Process Solutions (APS), worked on the Inbicon technology and lead business development and Front End Engineering Design to large-scale commercial production since 2009, purchased the exclusive rights to the technology license to the Americas (Inbicon Americas). New Energy Blue has performed feasibility studies to multiple sites in the American Midwest where agricultural residues (wheat straw, corn stover) are abundant to supply these future commercial operations within a 50 mile radius from each site. New Energy Blue expects to build out at multiple sites to supply low carbon fuel supply demands such as the state of California and the country of Canada.  Feed stock  The optimal biomass feedstock the company‚Äôs technology is designed for is wheat straw. However, they have also tested corn stover, grasses, sugar bagasse, arundo, sorghum, and palm oil residue. Therefore, it is an adaptable process that can utilize the most profitable feedstock.  Pretreatment processes  Inbicon utilizes a hydrothermal pretreatment process after the mechanical conditioning of the feedstock. The premise of this process is to produce a fibre fraction and a liquid fraction through an extraction using hot water. In the fibre fraction this process achieves greater than 80% of the lignin present in the initial feedstock.B.H. Christensen. L.H. Gerlach ‚ÄúMethod and Apparatus for conversion of Cellulosic Material to Ethanol.‚Äù U.S. Patent 8 123 864, Feb. 28, 2012. Whereas the liquid fraction contains: C5 sugars, alkali chlorides and fermentation inhibitors. The main fermentation inhibitor present is acetic acid. However, the fermentation inhibitors can later be removed through detoxification with NH3 at a feasible cost. Since this pretreatment process does not use acids or bases and only water it eliminates the need to extract pretreatment chemicals once completed. During the initial step of the hydrothermal pretreatment process the feedstock is soaked and simultaneously placed in temperatures of up to 100 ¬∞C and ambient pressure. This allows for the extraction of air present and saturates the feedstock with water. The next step entails a pressurized treatment at elevated temperatures in the range of 170 to 230 ¬∞C through the addition of hot water or steam for approximately 5‚Äì15 minutes. This pressurized treatment can be repeated at altered temperatures and pressures in different zones increasing each subsequent time, therefore, labeled as a counter-current process. The steam released during the hydrothermal pre-treatment process is collected and reused in downstream evaporation processes. Throughout the hydrothermal pretreatment, there are acids formed that causes the fibre fraction to be nearly neutral in pH. The main benefit of this is that the pH will have to barely be adjusted for enzymatic liquefaction. The idea behind Inbicon‚Äôs hydrothermal pretreatment is not to remove the hemicellulose and lignin from the fibre fraction but to nullify its protection of cellulose. Even though Inbicon makes it clear that it refuses to be bound to a theory. They reason that when lignin is melted in the presence of water, because of its hydrophobic nature it will form micro- droplets that solidify at lower temperatures. The conditions used in the pretreatment also hydrolyze hemicellulose. Therefore, the creation of these lignin micro-droplets and the hydrolysis of hemicellulose neutralize the two components protecting cellulose. This method keeps feedstock in its native fibrous state, while enhancing the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. Enzymes Inbicon has approved three companies' enzymes for their patented cellulosic ethanol production method: Novozymes, Genencor and Royal DSM. Novozymes As of 2012 Novozymes produces Cellic CTec3, which is a cellulase and hemicellulase complex. This is the third generation of this CTec complex. They boost the enzymatic activities with the addition of GH61 compounds. Based on improved Œ≤-glucosidases and new hemicellulase activity, the company claims that it is significantly more efficient at conversion in comparison to CTec2. Novozymes also offers Cellic HTec3 that is a hemicellulase complex that has different endo-xylanase and beta-xylosidase activities. In combination with CTec3 can boost conversion efficiency.http://www.novozymes.com/en/Shared_documents/Cellic3_FAQ.pdf Genencor DuPont Bioscience, formally Genencor, offers their ACCELLERASE¬Æ TRIOTM produced from genetically modified Trichoderma reesei. This complex consists of exoglucanase, endoglucanase, hemi-cellulases and Œ≤-glucosidase. The company‚Äôs enzyme complex can be used for a variety of pretreatments including: alkaline, AFEX, dilute acid, steam explosion and thermal/mechanical. The latter of the processes being the Inbicon‚Äôs chosen method. For optimum performance the company guidelines state pH in the range of 4-6 and temperatures of 40-57 ¬∞C. The amount of enzyme used depends on the biomass feedstock selected but is in the range of 0.03-0.16 mL per gram of biomass.http://www.genencor.com/fileadmin/user_upload/genencor/documents/TRIO_ProductSheet_LowRes.pdf Royal DSM DSM has an enzyme cocktail for the production of cellulosic ethanol. This cocktail contains thermostable cellulases that perform more efficiently at 60 ¬∞C than at 50 ¬∞C, which reduces costs of cooling during the production. The cocktail also has long storage stability, DSM claims that at a bare minimum of 3 months in room-temperature 14) DSM also claims because it can be produced on-site it reduces transportation costs and increases supply chain reliability. This enzyme cocktail has been tested at the Dong Energy- Inbicon demonstration plant in Kalundborg. They have confirmed and endorsed that DSM enzymes provide the same high yield and shown it is favourable for the industrial production of cellulosic ethanol.  Fermentation  It is believed the preferred fermentation ethanologen is a C6 fermenting microbe as the process recovers C5 molasses at the end of fermentation. https://www.eia.gov/biofuels/workshop/pdf/paul_kamp.pdf Pilot plant Inbicon established their first pilot plant in 2003. The company opened their second pilot plant in 2005. Finally, production start-up was unveiled in December 2009 in Kalundborg, Denmark. This plant contains two hydrothermal pretreatment lines of varying quantities. One line has a maximum capacity of 100 kg and the other 1000 kg of lignocellulosic biomass an hour. In the pilot plant only industrial yeast that ferments C6 sugars is used. This plant with the input of 30,000 t of wheat straw can produce 5.4 million litres of ethanol a year. The plant also produces 13,100 t of lignin pellets and 11,250 t of C5-molasses. In their initial pilot plant they were using 2.4 tonnes of feedstock per day. The 2005 scale-up pilot plant achieved a ten-fold increase to 24 tonnes per day. Finally in 2009 in the demonstration plant of Kalundborg they are capable of 100 tonnes per day. Inbicon‚Äôs future goal is for a plant that could use 1,200 tonnes of feedstock per day.M. Persson, VP Finance & Corporate Affairs,3rd Stakeholder Plenary Meeting.

Patents Non-sterile fermentation of bioethanol Inbicon has patented a method of non-sterile fermentation of ethanol. During the pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass, microbial inhibitors are released which have a significant effect on fermentation. Also, bacterial contamination, especially by lactic acid bacteria, such as lactobacillus, is difficult to prevent in non-sterile conditions. Inbicon has found a range of concentration at which the fermentation inhibitors only inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria, but have relatively no effect on fermentative yeast. By determining the optimal levels of fermentation inhibitors, yeast fermentation can be conducted under non-sterile conditions. These optimal levels can be achieved by controlling the water/biomass ratio of the lignocellulose biomass during and after pretreatment.Larsen, Jan. Non-sterile fermentation of bioethanol. U.S. Patent 8187849, May 29, 2012. Methods of producing ensiled biomass Before lignocellulose undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis, it must first be pretreated to break down its complex structure and expose cellulose. The pretreatment usually involves heating the lignocellulosic feed stock at high temperature (100‚Äì250 ¬∞C), which requires much energy and is very costly at the commercial level. Inbicon has patented a method of using ensiled biomass for bioethanol production that does not require expensive heating and chemical pretreatments. The ensiled biomass can be subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis without pretreatment.Larsen, Jan. Methods of producing ensiled biomass. U.S. Patent 8187848, May 29, 2012. Methods for reducing enzyme consumption in second-generation bioethanol fermentation in the presence of lignin Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic feedstock requires a high concentration of enzyme to overcome low enzymatic hydrolysis. The low enzymatic hydrolysis can be attributed to lignin, which blocks enzyme access to the cellulose. There are several ways of reducing the effects of lignin on enzymatic hydrolysis, one of which is the use of surfactant additives. Inbicon has discovered that at high dry matter content, enzymatic hydrolysis can be conduced in the presence of polyethylene glycerol.Larsen, Jan. Methods for reducing enzyme consumption in second generation bioethanol fermentation in the presence of lignin. U.S. Patent 7972826, July 5, 2011.

The district, comprising eight residences and an eight-car community garage, is commonly referred to throughout Boulder as \\"Little Russia\\" - presumably, due to its origins as a private, communal, non-developer driven housing project. In 1939, Henry Weihofen, a young law professor at the University of Colorado, dissatisfied with available faculty housing prospects in Boulder, was urged into action by University regent Valentine Fischer. The two men gathered a group of like-minded, low-ranking, (and low-salaried) faculty together to find a solution. James G. Allen, a junior member of the history department, joined with Weihofen and six others. In a series of evening meetings the eight families decided on a plan and selected a site for the innovative community housing project. The group held a drawing to decide which lot went to which family. After all eight families had moved in (by April 1940), landscaping of the Commons and the building of an outdoor fireplace and shelter house began. All of the original structures exist today. Handball courts that were part of the James Hunter's original Commons landscaping plan were never built. The community garage burned down, but was rebuilt to duplicate the original. Although, each set of house plans was based on individual families' needs and tastes, all of the houses were designed so the living rooms would not interfere with either the Commons or the mountain views. The Allen House has undergone several interior and exterior alterations over the years, the structure's overall footprint however, remains close to the original. An upstairs bedroom was expanded during the early 1980s. This added symmetry and balance to the street-facing side of the house. In 2011, a small sunroom (opening to the Commons) was added at the rear of the house. A Japanese-style garden encloses the backyard patio area. James and Marie Allen had two children, Elizabeth and James Jr. James Allen Sr. died in 1970. He had served as chairman of the University of Colorado history department and was recognized as an authority on the history of early space exploration. Marie Allen sold the home to Hunter and Irene Rawlings in 1972. Hunter Rawlings was a member of the CU Classics Department at the time. Lawrence Kaptein (a faculty member in the College of Music at CU) and Ellen Brock (Associate Director of CU's Science Discovery Program), along with their young daughter, Emily, purchased the home from the Rawlings family in 1992. The original blueprints for the Allen House, James G. Hunter's landscaping plan for the Commons area, construction-related documents, and information profiling the Allen family can be found at the Carnegie Branch (local history archive) of the Boulder Public Library. Photographs of the Allen House have been published in several books and newspapers. Pictures of the rear garden and Commons area can be seen in Gayl Gray's Vintage and Artistic Homes of Boulder. Interior photographs from the Rawlings' era can be seen in Historic Homes of Boulder County.

It includes the living families and orders Caprimulgidae (nightjars, nighthawks and allies), Nyctibiidae (potoos), Steatornithidae (oilbirds), Podargidae (frogmouths), Apodiformes (swifts and hummingbirds), as well as the Aegotheliformes (owlet-nightjars) whose distinctness was only recently realized. The Apodiformes (which include the \\"Trochiliformes\\" of the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy) and the Aegotheliformes form the Daedalornithes. Description The material evidence for this group is very equivocal; the most ancient Strisores are quite nondescript tree-dwellers but already tend towards peculiarly apomorphic feet, and no Cretaceous fossils are known. Torpor and other metabolic peculiarities are very frequently found in this group, perhaps more often than in any other bird lineage. The synapomorphies that define this clade are the ossa maxillaria separated by a large cleft, a mandible with very short pars symphysialis, and rami mandibulae very slender in their distal half. Taxonomic history The taxonomy of this group of birds has a long and complicated history. Jean Cabanis originally coined the name Strisores in 1847 as an order encompassing a much broader group of birds subdivided into two 'tribes': The Macrochires (hummingbirds, swifts, and nightjars, including oilbirds and potoos, but notably excluding frogmouths) and the Amphibolae (hoatzin, mousebirds, and turacos). Hermann Burmeister later excluded the taxa in Cabanis' Amphibolae from Strisores, but added kingfishers and motmots. Subsequent authors used either definition according to their own judgement, with Baird following Cabanis', and Cooper following Burmeister's usage. In 1867, Thomas Henry Huxley proposed the name Cypselomorphae for hummingbirds, swifts, and nightjars (including owlet- nightjars and potoos), however, he considered frogmouths and oilbirds unrelated due to aspects of their skull morphology. In the 1880s Anton Reichenow continued to use Strisores in a similar sense as Huxley's Cypselomorphae (this time also excluding the owlet-nightjars), but by the late 19th Century, Strisores had fallen into disuse, and this remained the case through the 20th Century. By the early 21st century, analyses of anatomical morphology and molecular phylogenomics demonstrated that the order Caprimulgiformes as had been used for much of the 20th century (oilbirds, potoos, nightjars, frogmouths, and owlet-nightjars) is actually paraphyletic respective to Apodiformes (hummingbirds, swifts, and treeswifts), with apodiform birds nesting deeply within caprimulgiformes and a sister taxon to the owlet-nightjars. The discovery has led to a challenge of reconciling a Linnean hierarchy with phylogenetic relationships while still maintaining nomenclatural stability, resulting in a complicated situation where some researchers currently use the resurrected name Strisores in a new sense, others expand the order Caprimulgiformes to include the 'traditional' apodiform families, whereas others use the superordinal name Caprimulgimorphae Cracraft, 2013, raising the 'traditional' caprimulgiform families to the rank of order. Proposed phylogenetic definitions of Strisores and Caprimulgimorphae treat Strisores as the crown group and Caprimulgimorphae as the total group. This allows both names to be valid, with similar but not identical meanings. Evolution Messel fossil site Strisores has a well-represented fossil record, with fossils of most major strisorean lineages known from the Paleogene. The relationships of the Early Eocene Parvicuculus and Procuculus from the southern North Sea basin are unresolved, but they bear some similarities to cypselomorphs. The fossil evidence is quite consistent in this group. Over some 20 million years, throughout the Eocene, the present-day diversity (as well as some entirely extinct lineages) slowly unfolds. By mid- Oligocene, some 30 million years ago, the crown lineages are present and adapting to their present-day ecological niches. By the distribution of fossils, the Paleogene radiation seems to have originated in Asia, which at that time became a highly fragmented landscape as the Himalayas lifted up and the Turgai Strait started to disappear. Several fossil taxa are tentatively placed here as basal or incertae sedis * Eocypselus (Late Paleocene or Early Eocene) * Paraprefica (Early Eocene?) * Archaeotrogonidae (Early Eocene of England ?- Late Eocene/Early Oligocene of France) * Hassiavis (Middle Eocene of Messel, Germany) - Archaeotrogonidae? * Protocypselomorphus (Middle Eocene of Messel, Germany) Systematics Strisores contains the extant families Aegothelidae, Apodidae, Caprimulgidae, Hemiprocnidae, Nyctibiidae, Podargidae, Steatornithidae, and Trochilidae. Apodidae and Hemiprocnidae are grouped together as Apodi, Apodi and Trochilidae are grouped together as Apodiformes, and Apodiformes and Aegothelidae are grouped together as Daedalornithes.

It was also the first digital camera to be interfaced to a microcomputer. The digital sensor for the camera was a modified 1kb dynamic RAM (DRAM) memory chip that offered a resolution of 32 √ó 32 pixels (0.001 megapixels). Background Correspondence from the editorial director of Popular Electronics magazine, dated July 25, 1974, regarding publishing a cover story on the \\"CYCLOPS\\" camera project The Cyclops Camera was developed by Terry Walker, Harry Garland, and Roger Melen, and introduced as a hobbyist construction project in the February 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine. One month earlier the MITS Altair 8800 microcomputer had been introduced in this same magazine. Les Solomon, technical editor of Popular Electronics, saw the value of interfacing the Cyclops to the Altair, and put Roger Melen (co-developer of the Cyclops) in contact with Ed Roberts (president of MITS) to discuss a collaboration. Roger Melen met with Ed Roberts at MITS headquarters in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Roberts encouraged Melen to interface the Cyclops to the Altair, promising to ship Melen an early Altair computer so that he and his colleagues could begin work on this project. Roger Melen formed a partnership with Harry Garland to produce the Cyclops Camera, and other products for the Altair computer. They named their new venture \\"Cromemco\\" after the Stanford University dormitory (Crothers Memorial Hall) where they both had lived as graduate students. In January 1976 MITS introduced the Cromemco Cyclops Camera as the first peripheral for the Altair Computer. Technology Cromemco 1024-element image sensor used in the Cyclops Camera. The electronics for the Cyclops was contained on three small circuit boards. The two red LED's on the first board are the bias lights to provide background illumination of the sensor for low-light conditions. The Cyclops Camera used an innovative image sensor that was actually a modified MOS computer memory chip. The opaque cover on the chip was removed and replaced with a glass lid. The theory of operation was described in the original Popular Electronics article. Initially the 1024 memory locations, which were arranged in a 32 √ó 32 array, were filled with all 1s. Light shining on these memory cells would cause their contents to change to 0s. The stronger the light, the more quickly a cell would change from 1 to 0. The Cyclops used a 25mm f2.8 D-mount lens to focus an image on the sensor array. The memory array was scanned once to store all 1‚Äôs in the memory elements. This was quickly followed by a series of 15 read-out scans. The cells that had the most incident light (i.e. the brightest parts of the picture) changed from 1 to 0 the soonest. Cells with little or no incident light (i.e. the darkest areas of the picture) would not change at all. So with a series of scans the Cyclops could produce a digital, gray-scale representation of the image. The Cyclops also had two bias lights that could be used to increase its sensitivity in low-light environments. These lights could be adjusted either manually or under computer control to shine a uniform, low level of light on the sensor. Once adjusted, the Cyclops would then be sensitive to even the smallest amount of incident light from an image, even in low-light situations. Legacy Today solid-state digital cameras are ubiquitous. A high-resolution digital camera sensor today (2019) may contain 40 million sensor elements (40 megapixels) which is 40,000 times more than the 0.001 megapixel sensor of the Cyclops.

The Rangkul Valley Important Bird Area is a 1612 km2 tract of land in eastern Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province in eastern Tajikistan, not far from the border with China. It contains two high altitude lakes and has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA), as well as a Ramsar site. Description The Rangkul Valley is an inter-mountain trough in the eastern Pamir Mountains 60 km north-east of the district centre of Murghab. The central part of the IBA, at an altitude of 3600‚Äì4000 m, contains two lakes, Rangkul and Shorkul, which form an endorheic system and are connected by the Izyuk channel. Rangkul is a freshwater lake with an area of 8 km2 and a depth of 6 m. Shorkul is brackish; it has an area of 7 km2. Both lakes freeze in winter and contain no fish, but support numerous invertebrates, including amphipods, beetles and mosquito larvae. Apart from the lakes and their littoral zones the valley is predominantly alpine semi-desert with scattered shrubs and is subject to strong winds. It is threatened by overgrazing, which leads to increased wind erosion and desertification. Birds The most favourable habitats for birdlife are along the rivers and lake shores. The site was classified as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants; it has been designated as a protected Ramsar site since 2001. These include Tibetan snowcocks, Himalayan snowcocks, bar-headed geese ruddy shelducks, saker falcons, Himalayan vultures, lesser sand plovers, brown-headed gulls, Tibetan sandgrouse, yellow-billed choughs, Hume's larks, wallcreepers, white-winged redstarts, white-winged snowfinches, rufous-streaked accentors, brown accentors, black-headed mountain-finches, Caucasian great rosefinches and red- fronted rosefinches.

A tributary of the Santa Ana River, it flows through San Timoteo Canyon. San Timoteo Creek has a drainage basin of about . The creek receives most of its water from headwater tributaries flowing from the San Bernardino Mountains near Cherry Valley, as well as Yucaipa Creek, which flows from Live Oak Canyon. In the past the creek was intermittent. Today it flows year-round due to agricultural runoff and secondary treatment discharge from a water treatment plant in Yucaipa. The name \\"San Timoteo\\" was given to the creek and canyon around 1830. It is Spanish for Saint Timothy. Course San Timoteo Creek is formed by the confluence of Little San Antonio Creek and Noble Creek west of Beaumont. Coopers Creek joins from the southeast just before the San Timoteo enters the San Timoteo Canyon. The San Timoteo flows northwest through San Timoteo Canyon, north of The Badlands in the southern hills of Redlands. Yucaipa Creek, flowing from Live Oak Canyon, joins San Timoteo Creek in San Timoteo Canyon. After the creek leaves the canyon it flows through Bryn Mawr and Loma Linda to its mouth on the Santa Ana River, near the I-10 and I-215 interchange. History Historically, San Timoteo Canyon was used as a travel corridor by Native Americans and Spanish ranchers. San Timoteo Canyon Road was used by stage coaches from the 1880s through the 1920s. By the 1910s the road was being used by cars. A large Native American village used to exist near the mouth of San Timoteo Canyon. Its inhabitants were ultimately incorporated into the Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel. In the 19th century the village of Saahatpa was established in San Timoteo Canyon by Chief Juan Antonio and his band of Cahuilla Indians. The village was abandoned after a devastating smallpox epidemic in 1862‚Äì63. In May 1877 the Southern Pacific Railroad Company completed tracks through San Timoteo Canyon, over San Gorgonio Pass and east to Yuma, Arizona. During the great Los Angeles flood of 1938, the creek flooded, causing damage and destruction.http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/government-and- politics/20140411/icounty-restricts-use-of-san-timoteo-canyon-road-new-trail- sethttp://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/general-news/20120202/recent-rains-bring- of-flood-of-memories In 1969, the creek overflowed its banks again, causing damage in Redlands and inundating two-thirds of Loma Linda. Many of the bridges over the creek washed away, and Loma Linda Academy was completely flooded.http://docs.adventistarchives.org/docs/PUR/PUR19690313-V68-36__B.pdfhttp://patch.com/california/redlands/quakes- not-the-only-concern-locals-face-says-seismologist These floods led to controversial calls for flood control on the creek. The federal government made appropriations for channelization of the entire creek in 1988, but local opposition to the measure was strong. Eventually, a compromise measure was reached, in which the creek was only partially channelized in 2008 by the US Army Corps of Engineers. In 2010, the creek again flooded parts of Loma Linda. In 2013, the Corps of Engineers completed a flood control mitigation project which included maintenance and revegetation. The creek is a popular local venue for hiking and mountain biking.http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/article/ZZ/20090220/NEWS/902209945 Flood control and environmental projects Urbanization is occurring rapidly in the San Timoteo watershed, resulting in an increased potential for floods. The United States Army Corps of Engineers has built flood control structures along most of the lower reaches of the creek. A concrete-lined channel runs from the confluence of the Santa Ana River upstream. Due to public opposition regarding extending the concrete channel in more upstream portions of San Timoteo Creek, flood control upstream of the concrete section uses a soft-bottom channel through most of the project. The Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with San Bernardino County, Redlands, and Loma Linda, are working to restore sections of San Timoteo Creek's riparian ecosystem to a close approximation of its natural state, while recognizing it is not possible to restore certain reaches to a pristine condition. San Timoteo Creek is one of the few remaining functional wildlife corridors linking the Santa Ana River and Prado Basins on the west with the San Bernardino, San Gorgonio, and San Jacinto Mountains to the east. San Timoteo is one of the last major drainage systems in the inland area of Southern California with some significant remnants of riparian vegetation and habitat.

It is surrounded with the Citadel square and Al-Sultaniyah Madrasa from the west, Al-Otrush Mosque from the south, the Palace of Justice and Hammam Yalbugha from the east and the Citadel from the north. History The Serail in 2011 The idea for the construction of a new government house came when the State of Aleppo was declared by the French General Henri Gouraud in September 1920. However, the construction started only in 1928, after the formation of the Syrian state under the French mandate. The serail was designed by the Syrian-Armenian architect Kegham Akgulian, and the construction was carried out under the supervision of another Syrian-Armenian engineer Kevork Baboyan. The inauguration of the building took place on 15 April 1933 to become the house of the government in Aleppo and the regular seat of the governor and the mayor of the city. It served as the house of the government until 2008, when the new building of the Aleppo city council was opened. In August 2014, the building was almost completely destroyed during the Syrian Civil War, by an underground explosion conducted by the armed extremist rebels.

Personal life Lee is a native of Virginia in the United States. She is married to Sam Lee Kwok-Tung, a Hong Kong Chinese man, with whom she has two children, and moved to Hong Kong with him in 1994. Equestrian career Lee began representing Hong Kong in equestrian competition at the international level soon after her arrival. She won medals in every competition in which she participated since 2001, held Hong Kong's high jump record, and was ranked 11th in the world in the International Federation for Equestrian Sports' World Jumping Challenge. With Lee's skill, and equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics being held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing with the rest of events, it was a natural next step for her to attempt to participate, but her road to the Olympics was filled with obstacles. Lee, along with fellow U.S. citizen showjumpers Jennifer Chang and Charlotte Morse and U.K. citizen dressage rider Aram Gregory, were not successful in obtaining special dispensations from the International Olympic Committee to compete for Hong Kong without holding Chinese nationality. Among them, Lee and Gregory chose to apply to for naturalisation as Chinese nationals to the Hong Kong Immigration Department, which is authorised by Beijing to process Chinese nationality applications from Hong Kong residents. People of Chinese descent born in Hong Kong are permitted to hold multiple citizenship; however, applicants for naturalisation are required to renounce all other citizenships they hold. This was a difficult decision for Lee, in particular due to her concerns about her ability to travel back to her former home to care for her ageing parents; the U.S. is alone among Western countries in not granting visa-free treatment to holders of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports, meaning she would have to apply for a United States visa, and could face the possibility of rejection. Lee was approved for naturalisation in July 2008, but her quest to represent Hong Kong at the Olympics finally faced an insurmountable barrier in the form of an injury to her horse, Mr Burns. The horse was in Belgium undergoing pre-export quarantine at the time. Lee's withdrawal meant that Hong Kong would not field an Olympic show jumping team; Lee's fellow show jumpers Kenneth Cheng, Samantha Lam, and Patrick Lam would go on to compete as individuals. Lee went on to compete for Hong Kong at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou. She made another attempt to enter the Olympics as a member of the Hong Kong show jumping team which participated in team selection trials for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Lee did well individually, with 17 penalties over two rounds placing her at 17th among 37 contestants, but other members of her team had worse luck, and in the end they failed to qualify.

One of the 6 original \\"Steel and Iron Divisions\\", it was created in 1951 and consisted of some 10,000 to 15,000 men. First Indochina War The 316th Division was formed in February/March 1951 from various ethnic minorities in the high region bordering Laos and first saw action in April 1951 at the Battle of M·∫°o Kh√™. In October 1952 the 316th took part in the attack on Nghia Lo as part of a Viet Minh offensive against French positions on the Red River and in the high region near Laos. In April 1953 the 316th moved towards Xam Neua which was abandoned as indefensible by the French, by 23 April the 316th and 308th had surrounded a French air-land base on the Plain of Jars. From September‚ÄìNovember 1953 Regiment 176 from the 316th engaged French GCMA teams in the Song River valley and that were blocking Route Provinciale 41. On 15 November the remainder of the 316th was ordered to move into the T'ai Highlands. The 316th harassed the T'ai Federation forces as they retreated from Lai Ch√¢u to ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß, capturing Lai Chau on 12 December and by 17 December they were deployed east of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß. In January 1954, a Battalion from Regiment 176 accompanied the 308th Division on a probe towards Luang Prabang, capturing Muong Khoua on 1 February. Hampered by French airpower, the airdrop of the 1st Colonial Parachute Battalion on Muong Sai and the deployment of Groupe Mobile 7 to Luang Prabang, the Viet Minh force withdrew towards ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß on 20/21 February. During the Battle of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß, the 316th's first action was on 15 March 1954 probing the French strongpoints at Dominique 5 after the capture of Strongpoint Beatrice by the 312th Division. Further south Battalion 888 of Regiment 176 was tasked with isolating Strongpoint Isabelle from the central French position in the valley. On 27 March the 98th and 174th Regiments were assigned the task of capturing the Eliane 1 and 4 strongpoints. The attack on Eliane commenced at 5pm on 30 March and the 320th succeeded in capturing Eliane 1 within 3 hours, but were unable to secure Eliane 2 in a fierce battle. Eliane 1 was recaptured by a French counterattack on 31 March but had to be abandoned again that day and was recaptured by the French on 10 April. On 31 March Regiment 98 was relieved by Regiment 102 of the 308th Division. On the night of 31 March Regiment 102 again attempted to take Eliane 2 but was beaten back and then replaced by Regiment 98 on 3 April. On 11 April Regiments 98 and 174 attempted to recapture Eliane 1 but were forced back. Following the failure of these attacks the Viet Minh resorted to choking off the French strongpoints by digging trenches and saps and, in the case of Eliane 2 a mine gallery under the hill. For the final assault on the French positions on the night of 6/7 May, Regiment 174 was tasked with taking Eliane 4 while Regiment 98 would make another attempt to take Eliane 2. At 6:45pm Regiment 98 began their attack and were held back by French artillery fire from Strongpoint Isabelle until Viet Minh counter-battery fire took effect.

Gunther, 452 U.S. 161 (1981), is a US labor law case, concerning discrimination and the lower standards of protection for gender pay due to the Bennett Amendment in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ¬ß703(h). Facts In 1974, four female county prison guards sued the County of Washington in Oregon for being paid less than male guards. They argued this was unlawful sexual discrimination. The County argued that male guards did more time overseeing prisoners and clerical tasks. They argued that under the Bennett Amendment, that the women could claim unlawful pay discrimination unless they showed under the Fair Labor Standards Act that they were doing \\"equal work\\". Judgment District Court The district court found that male guards were responsible for overseeing more prisoners and also that female guards spent some of their time in clerical tasks, but also found as a matter of law that a sex-based wage discrimination claim cannot be brought under Title VII unless it satisfies the equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act of 1963.Brennan. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit While not reviewing the first finding, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held with respect to the latter that \\"claims for sex-based wage discrimination can also be brought under Title VII even though no member of the opposite sex holds an equal but higher paying job, provided that the challenged wage rate is not exempted under the Equal Pay Act's affirmative defenses as to wage differentials attributable to seniority, merit, quantity or quality of production, or any other factor other than sex.\\" It interpreted the intention of the Amendment as incorporating \\"into Title VII only the affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act, not its prohibitory language requiring equal pay for equal work.\\" Supreme Court The US Supreme Court held by a majority that the women were not precluded from bringing a discrimination claim in principle, and did not need to show they were doing strictly equal work - this left open the possibility to claim that work was of comparable value.McCann, 36 Justice Brennan, speaking for the Court, indicated that the Bennett Amendment did not preclude comparison of differences in pay, but only those attributable to those four specific factors. Brennan J said the following: Rehnquist J (joined by Burger, Stewart and Powell) dissented. Significance Gunther did not prove definitive.McCann, 37. The Court did not determine how jobs might be properly compared, and one of the primary opponents of the majority opinion was the soon-to-be Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist. Rehnquist wrote explicitly against the comparable worth theory in his dissent (speaking as well for Warren E. Burger, Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and Potter Stewart), while Brennan countered that the majority opinion was not explicitly or implicitly supporting or refuting the comparable worth doctrine. Gutman underscored that \\"the Gunther ruling did not validate comparable worth theory; it merely permitted plaintiffs to try to make the prima facie claim under Title VII rules\\" and added that \\"[s]o far plaintiffs have been thwarted in every case.\\"Gutman, 187.

The film stars Sarah Snook, Mark Webber, Joelle Carter, David Andrews, Amber Stevens and Ana de la Reguera. The film was released by Lionsgate on November 7, 2014. Plot The pregnant Jessabelle \\"Jessie\\" Laurent (Sarah Snook) is about to move to her fianc√©, Mark's (Brian Hallisay) house when their car is hit by a truck just when they were backing up their car from the driveway, killing Mark and causing Jessie's miscarriage. Two months afterward, Jessie, who now uses a wheelchair, moves in with her estranged father, Leon (David Andrews) in St. Francisville, Louisiana. She resides in her mother's former bedroom; her mother having died due to a brain tumor shortly after she was born, when her father, as a result, left her to be raised by her aunt. One day, Jessie finds a box containing three videotapes shot by her mother, Kate (Joelle Carter), who addresses Jessie by her full name, congratulates her on her 18th birthday and gives a tarot reading about Death that tells of a transition, taught to her by a friend whom she met at a local church. Kate warns that an unwanted presence is haunting Jessie, a reading that turns out to be true, as Jessie feels that a gaunt black-haired woman (Amber Stevens) is haunting her ever since she moved back in to her father‚Äôs house. Jessie also has a vivid dream where she is strapped to a bed by her mother and witnesses a voodoo ritual being conducted, where blood flowing into a breathing regulator chokes her. Leon repeatedly tries to dissuade Jessie from watching the tapes by breaking them and throwing Jessie's wheelchair into the lake. One day, Jessie has frightening encounter in the bathtub with the same woman during physical therapy. After lifting Jessie onto Kate‚Äôs wheelchair, Leon coerces her physical therapist into leaving the house. After telling Jessie that the Kate in the tapes is not her mother due to the tumors she had, Leon attempts to burn all of the tapes, but a supernatural force burns him alive inside the yard shed. During his funeral, Jessie reunites with her high school friend, Preston Sanders (Mark Webber), but collapses after she sees a severely burned man (Vaughan Wilson). After Preston leaves from tending to Jessie, Jessie discovers a tape with no label on it that she opts not to watch. The next day, Jessie and Preston head across a nearby bayou, which Jessie has been suspicious of since observing glittering light and flames appearing there. The two discover voodoo icons and effects, as well as a grave of \\"Jessabelle\\" with a baby's skeleton, dated on Jessie's birthday, which they turn over to Sheriff Pruitt (Chris Ellis) for DNA testing. Jessie and Preston then visit the house of Mrs. Davis (Fran Bennett), the mother of one of their friends, who speaks about Moses Harper. Thinking that Moses may be involved in the supernatural occurrences, the two head to Moses' voodoo shrine in a ruined church, but are attacked by a group of men who force them to leave. The two return to Jessie's home where Preston confesses that, despite being married, he is in love with Jessie. Preston offers to let Jessie live with his mother, which she accepts. Jessie watches the fourth tape, showing Kate shouting \\"You're dead!\\" before it cuts off. Just before Jessie can finish her packing; Preston is attacked by the ghostly woman and knocked unconscious. Now left alone, Jessie conducts a ritual to summon the woman. After the ritual, Jessie is informed by Pruitt that the baby is Kate's daughter, but not Leon's. She plays the blank tape where it shows Kate casting a voodoo enchantment on an newborn white girl and committing suicide by gunshot, not before tearfully shouting that Jessabelle and her father Moses are dead. Jessie is confronted by Kate's spirit and realizes the truth that her ‚Äúfather‚Äù was hiding from her: the video tapes filmed were for Jessabelle, who was the daughter of Kate and Moses, the result of an interracial affair at the same church mentioned in the first tape. Jessebelle was killed on the night of her birth, along with her father, by Leon. Leon snapped Jessabelle‚Äôs spine in half, pushed a baby carriage with her lifeless body and a china doll inside into the bayou, weighing it with down stones to prevent it from resurfacing. Leon then drives up to Kate and Moses‚Äô church where he shoots Moses to fatally injure him and sets the building ablaze, leaving Moses for dead in the burning church. Jessie realizes that she is the unwanted presence, being a white girl adopted by Leon on the same night to cover up the murders. Swearing revenge, Kate and Moses planned to transfer Jessabelle's spirit to Jessie. Jessie is pushed by Kate and Moses towards the bayou, where Jessabelle swims up and takes her mother‚Äôs bracelet, resurfacing back in the form of Jessie. Preston jumps in to save her and she kisses him and asks him to take her home. When Pruitt asks \\"Miss Laurent\\" if she is all right, she replies \\"It's Jessabelle\\".

Reception Critical reception for Jessabelle has been mixed to negative and the film holds a 28% \\"rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes (based on 36 reviews) with the consensus \\"Jessabelle hints at a bright future for star Sarah Snook, but clouds her performance with a clich√©d‚Äîand tasteless‚Äîstoryline.\\". Justin Chang wrote in Variety, \\"Making atmospheric use of the Louisiana locations, Michael Fimognari‚Äôs digital lensing alternates nicely between pleasingly sun-drenched exteriors and sewer-toned nighttime interiors,\\" but concluded, \\"novel twists and effective scares prove few and far between in this ludicrous bayou gothic.\\" Sheila O'Mally wrote, \\"Steeped in Southern Gothic melodrama, Jessabelle is interesting in some of the small details, and in its strong sense of the Louisiana bayou atmosphere, and then it completely falls apart when it starts being a horror film.

It is one of the oldest and largest existing barns in Albany County. The barn in an excellent example of vernacular architecture as influenced by the English cattle and horse ranchers which immigrated to the American West. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Oxford horse ranch was one of the earliest in the area, being established in the 1870s by Pete Johnson. The ranch was later sold to two Scottish gentlemen named Whitehouse and Stokes. It was under these owners that the ranch gained international recognitions as breeders of pedigreed horses, at times running up to 3,000 head. The Oxford Horse Barn provides important evidence the transplantation of the English upper class thoroughbred horse culture to the Rocky Mountain west and more specifically, Wyoming. The Oxford horse barn also played an important role in local history. Most notably it is associated with the name of Axel Palmer, who worked at and later became part owner of the then Whitehouse Ranch on which the barn is located. Palmer trained horses and used the barn loft as a kind of obstacle course for breaking teams. Architecture and construction The Oxford House Barn is a massive log barn measuring 158 feet 8 inches long and fifty feet wide. The structure has a distinctive earthen ramp on the back, used for providing wagon access to the loft, and a strict bilateral symmetry of plan and facade. Resting on a sandstone foundation, the barn is constructed of horizontal squared logs mortised into vertical posts at exact 17 foot intervals, which divides the long facade visually into nine equal sections. This construction technique in North America has many names but most common is piece sur piece. Massive ground level sliding doors with original hardware are located in the gable ends and also in the middle and end sections of the long facades. The rigid, tripartite, bilateral symmetry of the barn justifies considering it an agricultural manifestation of the \\"Georgian vernacular\\" tradition of England and the eastern U.S. References External links * Barn at Oxford Horse Ranch at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office Category:Barns on the National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany County, Wyoming Category:Log buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming ","title":"Barn at Oxford Horse Ranch"},{"id":"39068982","text":"Jo√£o Paulo Soares Almeida (born 10 January 1993) is a Portuguese footballer who plays for U.D.

It was the setting of a mass suicide in 1803 by captive Igbo people who had taken control of their slave ship and refused to submit to slavery in the United States. The event's moral value as a story of resistance towards slavery has symbolic importance in African American folklore and literary history.  History  Igbo women, photographed in Nigeria, early 20th century In May 1803 a shipload of captive West Africans, upon surviving the middle passage, were landed by U.S.-paid captors in Savannah by slave ship, to be auctioned off at one of the local slave markets. The ship's enslaved passengers included a number of Igbo people from what is now Nigeria. The Igbo were known by planters and slavers of the American South for being fiercely independent and resistant to chattel slavery.Filan, Kenaz (2010). The Haitian Vodou Handbook: Protocols for Riding with the Lwa. Inner Traditions / Bear & Co. p. 167. .Powell, Timothy B. (15 June 2004) \\"Ebos Landing\\", New Georgia Encyclopedia.' Retrieved 27 April 2013. The group of 75 enslaved Igbo people were bought by agents of John Couper and Thomas Spalding for forced labor on their plantations in St. Simons Island for $100 each. The chained enslaved people were packed under the deck of a small vessel named The Schooner York to be shipped to the island (other sources say the voyage took place aboard The MoroviaGlynn County, Georgia. \\"History and Lore: Ebo Landing\\". Retrieved 27 April 2013.). During this voyage the Igbo slaves rose up in rebellion, taking control of the ship and drowning their captors, in the process causing the grounding of the Morovia in Dunbar Creek at the site now locally known as Igbo Landing. The following sequence of events is unclear, as there are several versions of the revolt's development, some of which are considered mythological. Apparently the Africans went ashore and subsequently, under the direction of a high Igbo chief among them, walked in unison into the creek singing in the Igbo language \\"The Water Spirit brought us, the Water Spirit will take us home\\". They thereby accepted the protection of their god Chukwu and death over the alternative of slavery. Roswell King, a white overseer on the nearby Pierce Butler plantation (Butler Island Plantation), wrote one of the few contemporary accounts of the incident, which states that as soon as the Igbo landed on St. Simons Island they took to the swamp, committing suicide by walking into Dunbar Creek. A 19th-century account of the event identifies the captain by the surname Patterson and names Roswell King as the person who recovered the bodies of the drowned. A letter describing the event written by Savannah slave dealer William Mein states that the Igbo walked into the marsh, where 10 to 12 drowned, while some were \\"salvaged\\" by bounty hunters who received $10 a head from Spalding and Couper. According to some sources, survivors of the Igbo rebellion were taken to Cannon's Point on St. Simons Island and Sapelo Island.  Historical context  Igbo Landing was the final scene of events which in 1803 amounted to a \\"major act of resistance\\" by the Africans. These events have had enduring symbolic importance in African-American folklore and literary history.Watts, Linda S. (2006). Encyclopedia of American Folklore. Infobase Publishing. p. 211. . The mutiny by the Igbo people has been referred to as the first \\"freedom march\\" in the history of America. Although for more than two centuries most authorities considered the accounts to be an Afro-American folktale, research since 1980 has verified the factual basis of the legend and its historical content. The site was included as a historic resource in a 2009 county survey. The site bears no official historical marker. A sewage disposal plant was built beside the historical site in the 1940s despite local opposition by African Americans. The site is still routinely visited by historians and tourists. The event has recently been incorporated into the history curriculum of coastal Georgia schools.  Mythology and folklore  The story of the Igbo slaves who chose death over a life of slavery is a recurring story that has taken deep roots in African American and Gullah folklore. As is typical of oral histories, the facts have evolved over time, in many cases taking on mythological aspects.  Myth of the water-walking Africans  Floyd White, an elderly African American interviewed by the Federal Writers Project in the 1930s is recorded as saying: A typical Gullah telling of the events, incorporating many of the recurrent themes that are common to most myths related to the Igbo Landing, is recorded by Linda S. Watts:  Myth of the flying Africans  Another popular legend associated with Igbo Landing is known as the myth of the flying Africans. It was recorded from various oral sources in the 1930s by members of the Federal Writers Project. In these cases, the Africans are reputed to have grown wings, or turned into vultures,Royer, Bob (20 May 2012). \\"Barrier Islands of Georgia\\". The Cascadia Courier. before flying back home to freedom in Africa. Wallace Quarterman, an African American born in 1844, who was interviewed in 1930, when asked if he had heard about the Igbo landing states: As Professor Terri L. Snyder notes:  Reported haunting  Local people claim that the Igbo Landing and surrounding marshes in Dunbar Creek are haunted by the souls of the dead Igbo slaves.Buxton, Geordie (2007). Haunted Plantations: Ghosts of Slavery and Legends of the Cotton Kingdoms, Arcadia Publishing, p. 63. . Legacy In September 2002 the St. Simons African-American Heritage Coalition organized a two-day commemoration with events related to Igbo history and a procession to the site. The 75 attendees came from other states, as well as Nigeria, and Belize and Haiti, where similar resistance had taken place. They gathered to designate the site as holy ground and give the souls rest.The Associated Press, \\"Slave legend draws people for two-day remembrance in coastal Georgia\\", 2 September 2002, posted at St. Simon Island Heritage Coalition website, accessed 27 April 2016 The account of the Igbo is now part of the curriculum for coastal Georgia schools. Representation in other media The historical events pertaining to the Igbo slave escape in Dunbar Creek, and the associated myth, have inspired and influenced a number of African-American artists. Examples include Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, who used the myth of the flying Africans in her novel, Song of Solomon, and Alex Haley, who retells the story in his book Roots. The Paule Marshall novel Praisesong for the Widow also was inspired by these events. They are retold from the context of the Gullah descendants in the feature film Daughters of the Dust (1993), directed by Julie Dash. Other contemporary artists that allude to, or have integrated the complete tale of the Flying Africans in their work, include Joseph Zobel, Maryse Conde, Toni Cade Bambara, and Jamaica Kincaid. Imagery from the \\"Love Drought\\" portion of Beyonc√©'s visual album Lemonade is said to be inspired by Daughters of the Dust and the story of Igbo Landing.Owunna, Mikael, \\"Beyonc√©'s Love Drought Video, Slavery and the Story of Igbo Landing\\" Michael B. Jordan, as Killmonger in Marvel's Black Panther, made a reference to the Igbo Landing as he was about to die with the words . ‚ÄúBury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from ships, 'cause they knew death was better than bondage.‚Äù  References   Further reading  *The Legacy of Ibo Landing: Gullah Roots of African American Culture, Marquetta L.

In 1994, together with the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) and the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC), it drafted a model constitution for Kenya, which added to the pressure on the government of Daniel arap Moi to enact a new Constitution.\\"Success stories\\", ICJ Kenya In 2000, ICJ Kenya published a report on ‚ÄòThe State of Freedom of Information in Kenya‚Äô, followed by a campaign for a Freedom of Information Bill. Long-term campaigning for reform of the Kenyan judiciary resulted in 2003 in the resignation of many judges and magistrates suspected of corruption and incompetence. Commentators state that the organisation has \\"influenced judicial reform\\" and describe it as a \\"key knowledge repository\\" on the subject of judicial integrity. In 2010 the organisation sought an arrest warrant for the president of Sudan, Omar al- Bashir. The arrest warrant was issued by the Kenyan High Court in November 2011 and led to a breakdown of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\\"Kenya-Sudan relations veering towards a breakdown after court decision on Bashir's arrest\\", Sudan Tribune.

He is best known for being Keith Moon's personal assistant during the 1970s, and for publishing several books about Moon's life, Full Moon and Keith Moon ‚Äì A Personal Portrait. Biography Butler grew up in London at the same time as The Who became successful. He left school at 15 and worked for HM Customs and Excise (as had John Entwistle) before becoming a roadie for the band in 1967 or 1968. According to Butler, one of his early tasks for the band was to provide a getaway car so that Pete Townshend could steal a guitar from Jim Marshall's music shop in Ealing. He quickly became friends with Moon, regularly visiting the Speakeasy Club and after a spell of becoming personal assistant to Entwistle for 18 months, decided to switch to looking after Moon. Butler later described being Moon's personal assistant as demanding work, recalling \\"what you learnt was what was going on in his mind and tried to be a step or two ahead but he was very unpredictable.\\" He followed Moon to Los Angeles where they lived in the mid-1970s, but found Moon's ability to attract the wrong crowd being increasingly problematic. He recalls regularly throwing people out of their house in Trancas and destroying or disposing of drugs before Moon found them. He recalls making Moon's only solo album, Two Sides of the Moon as a way of keeping them occupied, later describing it as \\"the most expensive karaoke album ever made\\". Butler took the only photo of John Lennon and Paul McCartney together in the 1970s (and the last time they would be photographed together) when Moon attended a party at Lennon's beach house in Malibu in April 1974. Moon's lifestyle eventually became too much for Butler, who phoned up Who manager Bill Curbishley, stating flatly that Moon needed to leave LA immediately. He recalls telling Curbishley \\"I can't do this anymore and one of us is going to pop our socks and it fucking ain't going to be me.\\" They moved back to London and Butler promptly left Moon's services. Moon died in September 1978. Butler left the music industry after Moon's death and began to write Full Moon, his account of life with Moon, in 1980 with some friends to help him copyedit. The book was published in 1981 and was a sell-out success in the US. New Musical Express' Andy Gill gave a positive review of the book, noting the clear affection that Butler had for Moon. The book was republished in the early 2000s by Faber and Faber. Butler's second book, Keith Moon: A Personal Portrait was published in 2001 in a limited edition of 2000 copies.https://www.ijamming.net/Moon/KeithMoon3.html References Sources * Category:The Who Category:Writers from London Category:English biographers Category:20th-century biographers ","title":"Dougal Butler"},{"id":"39069305","text":"Chris Fleming (born March 3, 1970) is an American professional basketball coach who is currently the lead assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

International Trotskyism 1929-1985: A Documented Analysis of the Movement, Robert Jackson Alexander, Duke University Press, 1991, pages 217‚Äì220 After a student movement broke out at the Chu Hai College in 1969, the student activists published a periodical called Seventies Biweekly which became the platform of the radical youths. Until in 1972, few of the Hong Kong youths made an expensive trip to Paris to meet with the exiled Chinese Trotskyists. Few of the returnees such as John Shum and Ng Chung-yin left the Seventies Biweekly dominated by anarchists, and established a Trotskyist youth group called Revolutionary International League. It later took the name Socialist League and changed its name into Revolutionary Marxist League in 1975. The league published periodicals such as Combat Bulletin and aligned themselves with the International Majority Tendency of the United Secretariat. In 1975 it became the Chinese section of the Fourth International, together with another long-existing Trotskyist group the Revolutionary Communist Party.

Career  Born to a family of sailors, Lejoille started sailing at seven as a boy on the merchantman commanded by his father. He then studied at Abbeville and Amiens before embarking as a helmsman on the fluyt Tamponne in 1776. In 1780, he joined the crew of the Degranbourg, a merchantman chartered by the Crown in Suffren's fleet, on which he took part in the Battle of Porto Praya. At the arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, Lejoille took command of Degranbourg while his father returned to France. In 1783, Lejoille returned to the merchant navy. On 6 May 1793, he was appointed Lieutenant and given command of the 14-gun corvette C√©leste,Fond Marine, p.43 which he ferried to Toulon. On 14, an incident occurred between C√©leste and the Danish brig Franc-Navire, under Captain Elepsem, that triggered an investigation by the National Convention.Collection g√©n√©rale des d√©crets rendus par la Convention Nationale, Volume 35, D√©cret relatif √† la corvette fran√ßaise la C√©leste, et au bricq danois le Franc-NavireCode des prises et du commerce de terre et de mer, Volume 2 Hennequin states that while crossing, C√©leste captured the British war-brig Shout, of 18 guns. Arrived in Toulon, Lejoille was appointed to the Tonnant as first officer. He distinguished himself during the Action of 8 June 1794 where the frigate Alceste was captured, and transferred on Alceste as her new captain. In 1795, he took part in the squadron under Admiral Martin, and was the first ship to overhaul and engage the 74-gun HMS Berwick at the Action of 8 March 1795 where she was captured. A shot from Alceste having decapitated Berwick 's captain Adam Littlejohn, Lejoille was credited with much of the merit of the capture, and granted command of the prize.Chroniques de la marine fran√ßaise, Jules Lecomte, p.234 However, severely wounded at the right arm and leg, he was transferred to the flagship and convalesced in Genoa for eight months. Promoted to Chef de Division during his convalescence, Lejoille was first sent to Venice to oversee commissionings of the ships captured in the harbour, and then transferred to Corfu to take command of the 74-gun G√©n√©reux, in Brueys' squadron. He took part in the Battle of the Nile at the rear of the French line, duelling with HMS Bellerophon. His men inflicted heavy damage on the Bellerophon, but were damaged themselves in turn and eventually fled from the battlefield. Action between H.M.S. Leander and the French National Ship Le Genereux, August 18th 1798, C. H. Seaforth. After the Battle of the Nile, G√©n√©reux sailed to Corfu with and the frigate Diane and Justice,Gloires maritimes, p. 301 which he lost en route. Near Crete, G√©n√©reux met with HMS Leander, which she captured in the Action of 18 August 1798. The British officers were released on parole.Gu√©rin, p.175 British sources later accused the French crew and Lejoille himself of plunder and various war crimes;Gardiner, p. 43James, p. 234 the French captain who ferried the paroled officers of Leander to Trieste attacked the charges,Troude, p.143 and in his Batailles navales de la France, Troude accuses William James of further \\"augmenting\\" the accusations originally published in the Gazette de Vienne.Troude, p.144 L√©on Gu√©rin claims that the accusations stem entirely from the Life of Nelson and that it furthermore fabricated a report by Lejoille.Gur√©, p.516 (note 15)Le petit pamphlet anglais in-32, intitul√© Life of Nelson, fait pour l'√©ducation francopophage des √©quipages britanniques, invente un rapport de Lejoille et dit en outre, contre la v√©rit√©, que les deux capitaines et les autres officiers anglais furent indignement trait√©s. During the Siege of Corfu, Lejoille led G√©n√©reux to assist General Chabot and to harass the Russian blockade. As the situation of Corfu became more critical, Lejoille decided to organise a relief operation: he sailed to Ancona with G√©n√©reux and the brig Rivoli, where he loaded a 1000-man force, along with ammunition and food. One month later, he sailed back to Corfu. Awaiting a reconnaissance of Corfu, Lejoille decided to moor his ships in Brindisi harbour. In order to do so, he intended to sail past the fort defending the entrance channel without firing and attack it from behind. However, a navigation error grounded G√©n√©reux under the fort, forcing Lejoille to accept a gunnery duel. Lejoille was killed in the subsequent exchange of fire.Guerres maritimes sous la r√©publique et l'empire, Jean Pierre Edmond Jurien de La Gravi√®re, Charpentier, 1853, p.315 Captain Touffet replaced Lejoille,Gu√©rin, p.177 and the fort and city of Brindisi surrendered after a two-hour battle.

Bizhu  Bizhu is a three-day-long festival that commemorates the commencement of a new year for the Chakmas and is their most important festival. Bizhu marks the Chaitra-sankranti, which is the last day of the Bengali calendar, and the festivities span a period of three days starting on the day of the Chaitra-sankranti. It is thought that the festival lasted for a full fortnight in earlier times. Bizhu has close links to the practice of jhum cultivation among the Chakmas and is believed to have originated as a festival to propitiate the earth for a bounteous harvest following the first rains of the agricultural season. In recent years, the festival has lost some of its agrarian linkages and has become a social event for the Chakmas. The rituals associated with Bizhu too have been simplified over time. The festivities begin on the first day, also known as the Phool Bizhu, when Chakma households are cleaned out and decked with flowers. In the evening special prayers are made to the Buddha and lamps lit at the Chakmas' houses and Buddhist temples. The next day, Mul Bizhu, is a time for socialising as people visit others in their village, participate in traditional games and cook special curries and sweets for the day. According to Chakma belief, a person dying on the day of Mul Bizhu goes to heaven. The Mul Bizhu ends with a performance of the Bizhu dance. The last day, Gojjepojje din is set aside for the performance of various religious and social activities. The Bizhu dance is a group dance with participants aligning themselves in a square or circular pattern. The Chakmas dress up in their traditional attire when participating in it. It is thought to have originally been a devotional offering performed within the precincts of the Chakmas' temples. The dance is unlike other dance forms in that it is marked by abrupt pauses during its performance. In recent years it has enjoyed a surge in popularity owing to its appealing rhythm and easy tunes. Through the Bizhu dance, the Chakmas bid adieu to the departing year and usher in the new year.  Attire  The women wear pinon and khadi and deck themselves in silver ornaments while the men wear a headgear called khabang and a dhoti and jacket.  Musical accompaniments  The dance draws some of its charm by virtue of the music that accompanies it. Flutes and drums accompanying the dance set its rhythm. The dhol, baajhi, khenggarang and dhuduk accompany the dance. Of these, the khenggarang and dhuduk are crafted from bamboo while the dhol is a percussion instrument and the baajhi a flute.

She is the first Creole-American winemaker to own and operate a winery in the United States. Early life Rideau was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, a paternal descendant of Frenchman Armand Allard Gabriel Duplantier who sailed to America in 1777 on Marquis de Lafayette's ship La Victoire and established a plantation in Point Coupee, and later the Magnolia Mound plantation in Baton Rouge. She grew up in the Creole 7th Ward of the city, where her mother and uncles operated the Creole Bar and Grille. She has said, \\"There was not a great emphasis placed on education in my community, especially with Creole. Both my father and my mother attended high school, but neither graduated. Her father left the family and departed to California after her parents divorced when she was two-years old.\\" She initially aspired to become a Broadway dancer. Her grandmother moved in and taught Rideau to speak French. In the summer months she visited her father and worked at his ranch in Corona, California, and after several years of insistence that she wanted to live closer to her father, they moved into a one-room flat in eastern Los Angeles when she was 12. Her mother found work at a nearby sewing factory. At 16, Iris she became pregnant and married, only to divorce the father of her daughter, Renee, a year later. She found employment at her mother's factory and enrolled in night classes at a junior college. Rideau has said of her employment at the factory and decision to take night classes, \\"The line of mostly Black and Hispanic women would wrap around the corner in the mornings. We made about $15 a week. I knew I'd need an education or I'd never escape.\\" She graduated after a year and began working as a receptionist for an insurance agency, passing as a white woman to keep her job. Rideau married Jimmy Rideau in 1957, and they divorced in 1978. She has since remained single and is a great grandmother. Rideau has said that her drive to succeed as a businesswoman was a result of her natural self-motivating will and the environment that she grew up in. She has said \\"I never want to experience poverty again. That is what drives me. Also, when my daughter was growing up, I wanted to provide her with the security that I did not have as a child.\\" Career Investment banking Rideau began her entrepreneurial career in 1967 when she opened the Rideau & Associates Insurance Agency, and followed with Rideau Retirement Planning Consultants. She was an involved investment and securities broker in Los Angeles, and became actively involved in seeking better rights for ethnic minorities. Rideau gained much respect in Los Angeles for her activism in the 1960s, and from 1973 to 1976, she was appointed as Chairman to the Mayor‚Äôs Affirmative Action Committee, under then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, a job which involved securing employment for hundreds of ethnic minority women in the city. She managed the Rideau Insurance Agency from 1967 to 1999, and in 1982, she established Rideau Securities Firm, and set up two offices with 50 employees. Wine Rideau had long been passionate about food and drink when she decided to enter a career as a vintner in 1989. She bought a 6-acre plot of land in Solvang, California in the Santa Ynez Valley that year, and added 24 more acres six years later. This land became Rideau Vineyard two years later. Rideau employed an architect and winemaker to transform an adobe house into a wine tasting centre, with bathroom and kitchen facilities. Rideau sold her insurance agency and brokerage company in 1997. She said of her decision, \\"You know when you get close to retirement you say, 'What am I going to do?' And I said, 'There's nothing to do out in this country other than raise horses or develop a vineyard. And I don't ride horses, so the next thing to do was start a vineyard.\\" Rideau is interested in the production of Rhone wines, and produces Syrah, Mourvedre, Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier. Black Enterprise magazine has said that she \\"effortlessly combines delectable grapes from the Rhone Valley of France with the savory taste of Creole cuisine in her winery.\\" She sold 300 cases in her first year and now produces some 7,500 cases annually and has worked with winemakers Ariel Lavie (2002-2005) and Andres Ibarra (2005-2008) making around $3.5 million a year. Her wines have won the Best in Show in the Los Angeles International Wine Competition. Pamela M. Kalte has stated that her \\"success in the competitive world of vines and vineyards seems surprising, given that she knew nothing about wines before setting up Rideau.\\" References External links *Official site Category:American winemakers Category:Wine merchants Category:American accountants Category:Businesspeople from New Orleans Category:African-American activists Category:Living people Category:African-American businesspeople Category:American women in business Category:1930s births Category:People from Solvang, California Category:Activists from California Category:American female winemakers ","title":"Iris Rideau"},{"id":"39069378","text":"Ilbe Storage (), also known as ILBE (), is an alt-right website based in South Korea. The site, created in April 2010, began as a collection of the \\"daily popular\\" posts from the BBS of South Korean social website DC Inside. This gave the site its name Ilbe, which is short for Ilgan Best, Korean for popular daily. As of February 2017, it is the most controversial site in South Korea by daily traffic.  Ilbe subculture  Ilbe's userbase has strong right tendencies. The website has very few rules, but it does prohibit users from mentioning each other by their username or getting too close to each other, in order to prevent new users or dissenters from being down-voted indiscriminately by existing users. This policy has effectively made everyone more anonymous (and equal), in contrast with other popular Korean forums where the old users are more respected and hold greater authority during discussions. The forums are largely unmoderated, with exceptions made for cases that may result in litigation or cases in response to complaints. The lack of moderation, however, does result in problematic behaviors such as defamation or harassment, which are criminal under Korean Law. The website routinely comes under criticism for its users' actions, the most notable of which was the Korea Communications Standards Commission's request that Ilbe regulate problematic contents that are harmful for teenagers. 'Ilbe is advised to enhance teenager protection activity by KCSC' (News1) On the other hand, the website has been praised for its anonymity and free spirit: a spokesman for the right-wing Saenuri Party mentioned Ilbe as \\"free space where innocent people can speak their minds freely\\". (Joongang Ilbo) A large part of Ilbe's subculture comes from the users' collective identity as \\"losers\\" of a sort: until the founding of Ilbe, most of the large community forums on the Korean web were left-leaning to an extent where anyone with even a moderate right- wing opinion had to endure ridicule and name-calling by the majority including the moderators. Thus, Ilbe's userbase has embraced many of the derogatory terms used by the left to show pride in their dissent. Due to their vocal users and strong political/cultural influence, Ilbe has gained widespread attention by social critics, with some labeling the website a social phenomenon, Newspaper editorial 'The Ilbe phenomenon and ideological populism' written by Hwang Yong-seok, Professor of Konkook University (Seoul Economy Newspaper)[ http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201306042217105&code;=940202] 'The cause of Ilbe phenomenon is... expressing anxiety, feeling betrayed, anger from difficult life as amusement' (Kyunghyang Newspaper)[ http://www.naeil.com/news_view/?id_art=86391] 'To understand Ilbe phenomenon' by journalist Kim Joo-eon (Naeil Newspaper) and some critics consider Ilbe a Korean analogue of 4chan and 2channel.'How to deal with troll websites like Ilbe' written by Hwang Yong-seok, Professor of Konkook University (Hankyoreh) As a vocal minority of the users engage in questionable behavior both online and offline, the website has largely negative connotation, especially with the political left. Money Today SBS News Thus, the users tend not to reveal their identity as an Ilbe user in the real world to prevent themselves from being ostracized. The term \\"Ilming-out\\" (), which is a portmanteau of \\"Ilbe\\" and \\"Coming out (of the closet)\\", describes a disclosure as an Ilbe user to the general public, and is avoided. Having to resort to more discreet measures to display their identity, Ilbe users use a hand sign that represents the Korean initials of the website's name. Psychologist Hwang Sang-min said \\"It's a kind of play, to secretly reveal their participation in Ilbe which is not justifiable in society, and gain reputation among them.\\" (Herald Economy News)  Criticisms  Ilbe's political stance generally ranges from far-right, and Ilbe has raised controversy for its strong opinions, mainly from the left.[ÌëúÏßÄÏù¥ÏïºÍ∏∞Ïò®ÎùºÏù∏ Í∑πÏö∞Ìåå Í≤∞Ïßë ÏΩîÎìúÎäî ‚ÄòÌòêÏò§‚Äô] Ï£ºÍ∞ÑÍ≤ΩÌñ• 2012.06.19 In parliamentary inspection held in October 2013, member of Democratic Party Yu Seung-hui criticized Ilbe's antisocial aspect. He released the information from Korean Communications Standards Commission, hundreds of submitted complaints about harmful contents in Ilbe like suicide, crime, drug, sexism, violence, as well as defamation and discrimination against left-wing politics and Jeolla province. 'Ilbe, excess of antisocial contents like drugs and organ trafficking' (Kyunghyang Newspaper) Shin Hye-sik, representative of right-wing online press Dokrip Newspaper said \\"(Ilbe users) should make an apology for problematic claims\\". Kim Young-hwan, former pro-NK activist and a convert to the right now, said \\"Right-wing is an attitude to inherit conservative awareness, but in this criteria Ilbe is not right-wing. Ilbe's radical argument will escalate social chaos\\". Yoon Pyong-joong, right-wing professor of Hanshin University defined Ilbe's far-right extremism as \\"Isn't worth saying at all\\". They shared the understanding that Ilbe should be criticized by public argument, not by legal action. Ilbe from right-wing prospect, 'It's a kind of disease, More than senselessness' (Weekly Kyunghyang) Conservative monthly magazine 'Shindonga' released a special section to criticize Ilbe as 'close to fascism rather than normal right-wing' and 'antisocial'. 'Ilbe, a mutant monster who tickles fascism within us' Shindonga July 2013 Japanese journalist Yasuda Goichi, the author of The Internet and Patriotism (Netto to Aikoku) diagnosed Ilbe as similar to anti-Zainichi association, one of Japanese cyber far-right group (Uyoku dantai). 'Ilbe resembles anti-Zainichi association... maybe a phenomenon which revealed many Korean's heart' (Hankook Ilbo)  Allegedly criticizing former president Roh Moo-Hyun  The Ilbe Community is mainly known by citizens for allegedly making fun of former president Roh Moo-hyun. The political parties have declared a war against the Ilbe Community, as they have been consecutively criticizing Roh Mu-Hyeon, and other political leaders through many forms of media, such as making jokes, parody music containing criticisms and people's discontent against political leaders such as Park Geun-hye and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and spreading rumors on social media. Users make an Ilbe \\"theme song\\" every year, and they regularly parody popular songs with lyrics that criticize the leaders. Ilbe users compose their parody songs as a propaganda that attracts people who coincidentally listen to their songs, to join the community. Users are trying to add a sense of humor to their songs, such as exaggerating expressions of political leaders and colloquially referring them as \\"MC Muhyeon\\", \\"DJ Daejung\\", \\"MC Jong-Un\\" and \\"MC Geunhye\\".This makes their songs sound legitimate in some ways. Ilbe users also call May 23 'the day of Gravity', making fun of Roh Moo-Hyun's death(Suicide by jumping) saying that gravity killed him. Recently, following up the uprising criticisms and hostility against the Ilbe Community, Korean celebrities who accidentally use Ilbe terminology on social media make people misunderstand them as an Ilbe member. As a result, comic artists and companies are adding caution to their productions to avoid being misunderstood as an Ilbe member.  Denial of Gwangju Democratic Uprising  Although the South Korean government, judiciary and legislature officially concluded that the Gwangju Uprising was a justified civil movement by passing a special law, (also confirmed by UNESCO who registered records of the Gwangju Uprising as UNESCO World Heritage), UNESCO World Heritage Ilbe is propagating unverified conspiracy theories about Korean democratization. The May 18 Memorial Foundation (5.18 Í∏∞ÎÖêÏû¨Îã®), one of the Gwangju Uprising memorial organizations, announced that Ilbe is spreading questionable information like, '4 types of distorting 5.18 Gwangju Democratize Movement' (Yonhap News) *North Korean special forces were involved in the Gwangju Uprising. *The Gwangju Uprising was a heavily armed riot. *Military suppression against citizens was justifiable. *The 5.18 Special Law (5.18ÌäπÎ≥ÑÎ≤ï), which pays respect to the Gwangju Uprising, is unconstitutional. Claims similar to Ilbe's were denied by the government multiple times. The Minister of National Defense, Kim Gwan-jin, dismissed the allegation of North Korea's involvement during democratization as 'groundless'. 'Kim Kwan-jin confirms the involvement of North Korean special forces in 5.18 uprising is not true' (Hankook iNews) The Korean Communications Standards Commission decided to take disciplinary action against the right-wing television news programs, 'TV Chosun' and 'Channel A', which made allegation of North Korea's involvement during democratization. 'KCSC gives a hard blow to TV Chosun and Channel A' (SisaIN News) It was accused of \\"both defamation and spreading false information\\". In November 2013, the Daegu District Court dismissed a similar case of defamation against Gwangju Uprising victims, committed by 10 members of Jeonsamo (a Chun Doo-hwan fan group). Although they were found not guilty, the judge explained that their claim was insufficient to be considered defamation. Kyunghyang Newspaper Even journalist Cho Gap-je, who was on the scene in Gwangju, admitted that the Gwangju Uprising was a righteous anti- communism democratic movement in his testimony. Dokrip News Considering all these, Ilbe uses the word 'democratization' in a negative sense, similar in meaning to \\"thumbs down\\". However, various users of Ilbe claim that the seemingly inappropriate use of the word is just a mockery of the left wing.  Wide opposition to left-wing politics  Ilbe's opinions are expressed as strong opposition to left wing parties, political figures and supporters, alongside indiscriminate labeling of the South Korean left wing as pro- communism, pro-North Korea, pro-socialism, and anti-South Korean. Ilbe also labels some journalist like former chief editor of Monthly Chosun Cho Gap-je as \\"Ï¢åÎπ®\\" (Far-left communist) due to his support of the Gwangju Uprising as a justifiable movement. Cho Gap-je bashed from Ilbe (Joongang Ilbo) Causeless 'red-hunting' of Ilbe (Hankyoreh) Even though former president Roh Mu-hyun and Kim Dae-jung used neoliberal economic policies, and came under criticism from the left-wing for their conservative stance, Pressian Ilbe considers both to be 'communists' due to their conciliatory attitude toward North Korea in economy and diplomacy. Hankook iNews Opinion  Hatred of the Jeolla region  A sizable part of Ilbe users have an intense disliking for the Jeolla region in the southwestern portion of South Korea. 'Cyber specter who tickles regionalism' (Sisa Journal) This is due to several factors, including the fact that Jeolla province had a staggering 98% vote for a regional (left-wing) party candidate Kim Dae-jung, and their belief that the Gwangju Uprising has been placed on a pedestal by the locals, to the extent that all other moments in the history of Korean democratisation are overlooked, and that it was not a democratization uprising or movement, but simply a riot. The intense disliking manifests itself as verbal attack against Jeolla and related political figures.'\\"Eliminate all communists\\" to the classmate from Jeolla province' (Dong-a Ilbo)  Legal issues  Ilbe users show protests to different issues of the country, and they end up doing mass protests and singing Ilbe songs in city squares. Many Ilbe users ended up in court for degrading the public order. On November 28, 2013, there was a first trial of defamation committed by Ilbe user who injured the honor of Gwangju Uprising victims by disparaging their corpse photo as 'Skate(fish) parcel'. Yonhap News Offender claimed that he feels sorry for his crime and he sent such apology to the victims by phone call, but the organizations related to Gwangju Uprising victims said there was no such apology. Offender requested the jurisdictional transfer of his case from Gwangju District Court to Daegu District Court and it was accepted.

Twitter Screenshot MoneyToday  Misogyny  Ilbe takes an extremely hostile attitude toward types South Korean women that it deems undesirable, and expresses hatred towards them. Ilbe members think that men are superior and that women should be deferential to them.

NTUC, along with tripartite partners, the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM), work together to tackle issues such as job re-creation, raising the effective retirement age, skills training and upgrading of the workforce, promotion of fair and progressive employment practices, and a flexible wage system, among other labour-related issues. Singapore's tripartism model offers competitive advantage for the country by promoting economic competitiveness, harmonious labour-management relations and the overall progress of the nation. Singapore has only seen two major strikes in recent decades, once by shipyard workers in 1986 that was sanctioned by then NTUC secretary-general Ong Teng Cheong, and the November 2012 wildcat strike by Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) Chinese national bus drivers. The modernisation of the labour movement in the late 1960s has nurtured cooperation-based rather than confrontational labour relations between employees and employers. Today, rather than engaging in traditional adversarial unionism, union leaders in Singapore also sit on major statutory boards and are actively involved in state policymaking, allowing them to use negotiation, conciliation and arbitration, thus eradicating strikes and other industrial action as a form of settling labour disputes. Tripartism in Singapore Tripartism in Singapore, which refers to the collaboration among Singapore unions, employers and the government, has been practised since 1965 when NTUC and the Singapore government signed a Charter for Industrial Progress and a Productivity Code of Practice. In the 1960s, the tripartism institution was still weak, but the formation of the National Wages Council (NWC) in 1972 and later the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) in 2007 helped strengthen ties between the members. The tripartite was set up to strive for better working conditions for employees in Singapore and to maintain harmonious employment relations through the implementation of specific policies governing labour relations. The Singapore General Labour Union (SGLU) was formed in October 1945 to help Singapore develop a stable employment environment in times of turmoil and uncertainty. SGLU was quickly renamed as the Singapore Federation of Trade Union (SFTU) in 1946, which eventually became the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC) as we know it today. The role of NWC is to formulate wage guidelines in line with Singapore's social development and long-term economic growth. Every year, NWC convenes to discuss wage and wage-related matters, and issues guidelines pertaining to the remuneration of Singapore workers based on tripartite consensus. TAFEP works in partnership with employer organisations, unions and the government to create awareness and facilitate the adoption of fair, responsible and merit-based employment practices, providing tools and resources, including training workshops, advisory services, and educational materials, to help organisations implement fair employment practices. With the Protection from Harassment Act 2014, the Ministry of Manpower (Singapore), the National Trades Union Congress(NTUC) and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) have also developed an advisory since 23 December 2015 fighting workplace harassment. History A month after the Japanese forces formally surrendered Singapore to the British on 12 September 1945, the Singapore General Labour Union (SGLU) was formed. The British Military Administration was established shortly after to govern the island-colony until March 1946, working alongside the SGLU. The restoration process of Singapore's economy and employment conditions was facilitated by the cooperation between the two. SGLU was then renamed as the Singapore Federation of Trade Union (SFTU) in 1946. On 13 June 1951, the Singapore Trade Union Congress (STUC) was established to replace the SFTU. However, the STUC split in 1961 into the left-wing Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU) and the non-communist National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). SATU led a general strike against the government and was banned from operation when the leaders were arrested in the Operation Coldstore. NTUC quickly became the leading trade union organization due to their effectiveness and the symbiotic relationship with the People's Action Party (PAP), which was then institutionalized by formal links. In 1968, when the British withdrew all their military forces in Singapore, the government was faced with anxiety over Singapore's economy fearing that the retreat would leave thousands jobless . Laws were enacted to clearly delineate functions of management and those of trade unions. NTUC endorsed the Employment Act after being assured by the government that employers would not be allowed to exploit workers. NTUC's support for the new law led to a massive inflow of foreign investments thus resulting in a rapid expansion of Singapore's economy. Changes in the labour scene brought unsettling effects on workers in the unionized sector, causing membership to drop. In response, NTUC held a seminar to discuss ways to modernize the labour movement. It resulted in a decision to set up cooperatives to help meet the social needs of their members. In 1965, NTUC and the government signed a Charter for Industrial Progress and a Productivity Code of Practice. During the 1960s, the tripartism institution was still weak, but the formation of the National Wages Council (NWC) in the 1970s boosted the collaboration within the labour movement. NWC would review the state of the economy and offer rational recommendations on wage negotiations. The labour movement then introduced the Central Provident Fund, a social security scheme sustained by compulsory contributions by employer and employee, which provided the necessary capital for government projects and financial security for the country's workers in their old age. Towards the end of the 1970s, NTUC supported the government's efforts in restructuring the economy. The government changed its strategic focus from labour-intensive manufacturing to more skilled and technology-focused, causing workers without basic education to face unemployment. The labour movement started programmes for these workers so that they could have the basis to go on to skills courses. Singapore went into a recession in the mid-1980s that caused conflict between productivity and wage increases. To help the nation recover, NWC recommended the unions to forgo the 1985 wage increase and accept cuts in the employers' contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF). This drove Singapore into a quick recovery from the recession. During this period, a flexible wage system was introduced by the NTUC with full support from the labour movement. In 1990, the Singapore Institute of Labour Studies (SILS) was set up dedicating Singapore's desire to have a labour college. The Labour Movement 2011 (LM2011) vision was launched by NTUC to push for an all- inclusive labour movement that seeks to represent workers of all colors, nationalities, and ages and those in the new and high-growth sectors that have not been reached out to before. Major strikes in Singapore's history 1955 Hock Lee bus riots Workers from the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company started a strike on 23 April 1955 to protest against poor working conditions, long working hours and low wages. The protesters which include some Chinese students blocked buses from leaving the depots, crippling the city's entire transport system. The protests further escalated into a major riot on 12 May 1955, which later came to be known as ‚ÄúBlack Thursday‚Äù. Some 2,000 students and strikers were involved in the riots, which the police tried to break up with water cannons and tear gas. The crowd retaliated to the police actions by stoning policemen and buses. In total, two police officers, a student and an American press correspondent were killed in the riot while many others sustained serious injuries. 1986 Hydril strike On 2 January 1986, 61 workers from American oilfield equipment company Hydril voted to strike and picketed outside their factory. The two-day strike, which was sanctioned by then Secretary General of the NTUC, Ong Teng Cheong, was over the alleged victimisation and dismissal of six union members and officials. The strike resulted in an agreement to reinstate Abdul Rahman, who was the treasurer of the Hydril branch union, as well as compensate each of the five others who were dismissed the year before. 2012 SMRT bus strikes On 26 November 2012, up to 171 bus drivers from mainland China, who were employed by SMRT Buses, refused to go to work in protest against the disparity in salary between them and other foreign bus captains. 88 workers carried the strike into the next day by continuing the refusal to go to work. The strike was considered illegal due to the strikers' failure to give their employer 14 days' notice of their intent to go on strike, which was required by law for essential services such as transport. Kit Wei Zheng, an economist at Citibank Singapore argued that given the increase in labour activism across the world, the fact that it had come to Singapore was unsurprising. The strike resulted in five of the drivers who instigated the strike being charged in court. Out of the five, Bao Feng Shan was handed a six-week jail sentence for his role in the strike. Twenty-nine other drivers who participated in the illegal strike had their work permits revoked and were sent back to China, while over 150 drivers were let off with warning letters from the local police.

The fight The French and Malian troops left Gao on 12 March heading to In Zekouan, arriving there by the evening, and beginning search operations. They found nothing, but when the night came, two pickup trucks came up with several Islamist fighters and attacked the French and Malians. After the two pickups were destroyed, the terrorists abandoned their attack and managed to retreat. After this clash, two other pickup trucks were spotted two kilometers away. The French and Malians attacked them, destroying one, but failed to destroy the other. The next day, the French began to search In Zekouan and discovered an improvised explosive device manufactured with a bomb plane. Shortly afterward, the Jihadists ambushed a group of soldiers. The soldiers manage to push back the Islamists, entering the woods. Then another group of soldiers was attacked. The French and Malian soldiers begun to retreat, but then bombarded the Jihadist's positions in the forest. In the night the fighting stopped and the French and Malians captured the area, but they found no bodies or traces of the Islamists. On 14 March, north of Imenas, an aircraft located a pickup truck whose passengers were placing an improvised explosive device on the road ahead of the French and Malian column. Fighter planes and three helicopters were sent to the scene. They ambushed six pickup trucks in Torteuli, some filled with explosives. The helicopters opened fire, destroying all of the vehicles. The next day, the soldiers entered Torteuli but were attacked by fighters. After a brief exchange of fire, the Islamists fled into the woods.

The objective of introducing the Progressive Wage Model is to increase the salaries of workers through the enhancement of skills and improving productivity. Progressive Wage is enforced via business licensing (as opposed to legislation). This model was designed to enable rank and file workers to climb the wage ladder, and provides for a minimum wage. This would then lead to higher wages for the worker and improved overall productivity which helps sustain economic growth. History While the Progressive Wage Model concept was only introduced by the labour movement in June 2012, this remuneration model is actually an amalgamation of various existing programmes and initiatives over the years by the Labour Movement to help workers in Singapore upgrade and up-skill themselves to be able to earn higher wages. These programmes and initiatives include the Skills Redevelopment Programme, the Job Redevelopment Programme, the Best Sourcing Initiatives, and the inclusive growth Programme, among others. All of these already help workers in Singapore improve themselves to be able to take on better-paying jobs. However, the Progressive Wage Model takes things a step further by ensuring employers' commitment to their employees' career growth, better wages and increased productivity. Principles The Progressive Wage Model is based on the key objectives of helping Singaporean workers climb the four ladders of skills upgrading, productivity improvement, career advancement and wage progression. Thus far, seven unionised clusters in Singapore have implemented or are planning to implement a Progressive Wage Model to help workers. The Tripartite Cluster for Cleaners, a working committee formed representatives of the tripartite partners, is pushing for the Progressive Wage Model to help about 10,000 cleaners across various industries. These workers are set to earn a higher entry-level basic wage of between S$1,000 and S$1,200. About half of all cleaners employed under government contracts, or over 3,500 cleaners, currently earn basic wages of at least $1,000 per month. The median wage of cleaners in the civil service was between S$675 and S$950 prior to the introduction of the Progressive Wage Model. Minister of State Josephine Teo was reported as saying that the government plans to engage only cleaning companies accredited under the National Environment Agency's Enhanced Clean Mark Accreditation Scheme for all contracts called from 1 April 2013. According to NTUC Secretary General Lim Swee Say, the reason why Singapore can adopt this method of wage improvements through re-skilling and upgrading of workers is based on these factors: the availability of workfare supplements to help the worker while he or she undergoes training to reach the next step of the wage ladder; the establishment of a comprehensive employee training framework in the country; and the government's financial capacity to pay for such training programmes. The minimum wage model The Progressive Wage Model is an enhancement to a basic minimum wage model to help increase the salaries of workers in Singapore. NTUC Secretary General Lim Swee Say was reported as saying that he believed that the shortcomings of a minimum wage system outweigh the benefits. He noted that if the minimum wage was set too low, it would not help workers. On the other hand, if the minimum wage was set too high, that could result in higher unemployment as employers may not be able to afford to pay their workers. He felt the Progressive Wage Model would be a more sustainable approach to helping workers earn better wages. Labour MP Patrick Tay Teck Guan delivered a speech at the Singapore Budget Debate in parliament in 2013 highlighting how the Progressive Wage Model does not only apply to low wage workers but also to Professional, Managers, and Executives (PMEs). He gave the example of how Singapore Power, a unionized company of The Union of Power and Gas Employees, has implemented a structured path for Technicians to progress to Senior Technician, and thereafter to Technical Officer, Senior Technical Officer and to an Engineer which earns as much as S$7,000 per month. Singapore's union clusters representing various sectors are working alongside their respective tripartite partners, which include industry players and government officials, to design Progressive Wage Models tailored to meet the needs of each sub-sector. These clusters have set individual targets for progressive wage increases to help especially low-income earners, women and mature workers, the most vulnerable groups of the workforce. NTUC estimates that the Progressive Wage Model can help about 100,000 workers in the next two to three years from end-2012. Criticisms According to Singapore's Ministry of Manpower, Singapore does not have minimum wage and \\"salary is subject to negotiation and mutual agreement between an employer and an employee or the trade union representing the employees\\". Singapore is part of the fewer than 10 percent of countries globally that do not have a legislated minimum wage policy. There has not been any outright opposition to the Progressive Wage Model that was introduced in 2012, but several Singaporean politicians and the public have made calls for Singapore to legislate minimum wage to protect low-wage workers. During the Singapore Budget 2013 debate in parliament, Members-of-Parliament such as Inderjit Singh of Ang Mo Kio GRC and Nominated MP Laurence Lien expressed concerns that wages at the bottom of the economic ladder are not increasing quickly enough to help workers cope with a rising cost of living. In an article in The Straits Times in September 2011, Tommy Koh, Ambassador-at-Large for the Singapore government, echoed a recent comment by a journalist from the same paper that \\"Singapore is a First World country with a Third World wage structure\\". Koh believed that a minimum wage model would help low-income workers and promote inclusive growth in Singapore society.

Marek Nied≈∫wiecki, the long-term host of LP3 Lista Przeboj√≥w Programu Trzeciego (the Radio Three Chart, LP3) is the oldest and the longest-running music chart in Poland. Aired by Polskie Radio Program III, a division of the Polskie Radio public broadcaster, the list has been broadcast weekly since 24 April 1982. Initially hosted by Marek Nied≈∫wiecki, since 2010 the hosting duties have been alternated by Nied≈∫wiecki and Piotr Baron.  History  Although Poland of the 1970s and 1980s had been deeply behind the Iron Curtain, its music scene was far from closed to outside influence. Foreign music arrived to Poland through a variety of channels, including direct import of records by people who were permitted to cross the borders and through foreign radio stations available in Poland (such as Radio Luxemburg and the Polish section of the Radio Free Europe). Moreover, the contemporary Polish copyright laws were more liberal than those in non-Soviet-controlled countries and copyright infringements were usually not penalized. Because of that various western artist gained popularity in Poland regardless of the fact that their records were never officially released in Poland or even approved by the censorship office. At that time the Radio 3 was one of the few radio stations in Poland airing both foreign music and Polish music not officially supported by the authorities. The latter category included domestic rock artists, electronic music, sung poetry and many other genres looked down upon by the authorities. Because of that the Radio 3 gained wide popularity, especially among the younger generations of Poles. The first list was compiled and aired by Marek Nied≈∫wiecki on 24 April 1982, with the top three songs being \\"I'll Find My Way Home\\" by Jon and Vangelis, \\"O! Nie r√≥b tyle ha≈Çasu\\" by Maanam and \\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\\" by AC/DC. Since then the list has been compiled and aired weekly, initially on Saturdays between 20:00 and 22:00. Since September 1989 (list #395) the list was extended to four hours (18:00‚Äì22:00). A year later (list #475) it was moved to the Friday 19:00‚Äì22:00 slot. Between 2007 and 2010 it was briefly moved back to Saturday evenings, only to be returned to the previous Friday evening slots in April 2010. Every person is allowed to vote for up to ten songs. Initially (until April 1996) the votes had to be mailed to the radio station for compiling or the audience had to call the station and dictate the names of the songs. Since then voting by Internet (initially a BBS site, then a www site) is the main means of voting. Since late 1980s every weekly broadcast is accompanied by a short correspondence from the Netherlands (by Alina Dragan) and the United States (Wojciech ≈ª√≥rniak, Voice of America), with reports on the latest European Hot 100 Singles, Dutch Top 40 and the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. The chart gained a large fan following, with a busy internet forum and fan-made Internet Archive of the List of Hits, presenting all charts so far, with all songs and their respective places. On 11 November 2010 the fans of Radio Three chose the chart as the most popular Radio Three programme in its history.  Voting  Initially one vote for a Polish-language song and one for a foreign one were permitted, but soon the limit was extended and now every voter can choose up to ten songs in no particular order. The eligible songs are those that were aired by Radio 3 at least once. The list, variously compiled into a Top 20, 30, 40 or 50, is divided into two parts. The lower, for ranks between 31 and 50 (), are called the waiting room (). Songs in the waiting room are traditionally not aired in full and often only mentioned by their title and the chart rank during the weekly broadcast. The top 30 songs have more chances of being aired in full.

Five tribes (so- called Dulo) to the northeast and five tribes to the southwest (so-called Nushibi) formed the two rival factions, the border line being Ili River. Sibir as the monarch In 630, Dulo clan of tribes together with Karluks revolted against Tong the most successful ruler of the empire who was supported by the rival Nushibi faction. K√ºl√ºg Sibir murdered Tong who was his nephew and declared himself as the khagan (emperor) with the support of Dulo clan. According to S. G. Klyashtorny and T. I. Sultanov he was trying to end the tension between the khagan and the vassal tribes.S. G. Klyashtorny and T. I.

Geography The Lufuko drains part of the Marungu highlands. There have been proposals to conserve the forests above that border the Mulobozi River and Lufuko River into nature preserve areas. Theo Kassner travelled through the region in 1909. He reached the Tanganyika watershed at Mount Giambe. He recorded: Fish A species of catfish locally called ndjagali use the river for spawning from September to November. The fish are considered a delicacy by the people of the region. In the past they were owned and caught communally, and traded with other communities for salt or iron. The people considered that the spirit of the earth, Kaomba, caused them to multiply. The catfish were a major source of food for the villagers, but over-fishing around the end of the nineteenth century significantly reduced the numbers. In the mid-1970s the local villagers still caught the fish in weirs until the rainy season began, when the weirs were destroyed and the fish could pass to breeding areas higher up the river. Captain √âmile Storms established a station named \\"Mpala\\" at the mouth of the Lufuko River in May 1883. The station was established at the village of Lubanda, and was named after the local chief. When missionaries took over the post in 1885 they recognized the beliefs about Kaomba and identified the sacred parts of the river. For many years they controlled access to the river, using it for their own food or to reward those loyal to them. With technological advances at the start of the twentieth century it became possible to fish the lake far from the shores, and fishing became an individual occupation.

The park was opened to the public after the Second World War. From the 14th century Ampthill Park was a royal lodge and hunting park. In the 15th century it was occupied by Sir John Cornwall, who had married the king's sister, Elizabeth of Lancaster, Duchess of Exeter. Sir John amassed a large fortune and constructed Ampthill castle, a fortified house. After his death Ampthill Park passed to Edmund Grey, 1st Earl of Kent before becoming royal property again. Henry VIII used it for hunting and to hold Katherine of Aragon during the annulment of their marriage. By 1600 the castle was ruinous and in 1661 the park was given by Charles II to John Ashburnham, a Royalist supporter. The present house was built from 1687-1689 by architect Robert Grumbold for the Ossory family who held the estate under lease. In the late 1700s the house was remodelled by Sir William Chambers and the grounds landscaped by Capability Brown. On the death of Lord Upper Ossory in 1818, Ampthill Park became the seat of Lord Holland in whose time Holland House in Kensington, London, became famous as a gathering place for intellectuals. Notable 20th-century architect Sir Albert Richardson lived in Ampthill from 1919 until his death in 1964. During World War II the estate was occupied by the army. There was a farming camp near Ampthill, where volunteers recovered sugarbeet and were accommodated in tents in the grounds. After the war it was sold to Bovril Limited, becoming a Cheshire Home for the Disabled in 1955. In 1979, the mansion was rescued from dereliction and divided into four large homes. It is a grade II* listed building. The park is listed grade II. Ampthill Park was the burial place for the golden hare in the Kit Williams treasure hunt Masquerade.

In November 2014, Kooiman raised over $55,000 on Crowdrise and in direct donations to Folds of Honor while running the New York City Marathon in 3:54:15 with Major Dan Rooney. The organization provides scholarships and assistance to families of American troops who died or were injured in service to their country. Kooiman served as the philanthropy chair of her sorority, Alpha Delta Pi while at University of North Carolina at Wilmington. Beginning in August 2008, Kooiman was a fitness instructor in Charlotte.

The Seychelles Tourism Board is responsible for the promotion and marketing of the Seychelles islands as the preferred tourist destination. The Seychelles Tourism Board is a statutory body that came into existence on 1 April 2005 when the Seychelles Tourism Board Act, 2005, came into force. The Act brought together all regulatory and monitoring functions of the Department of Tourism within the Ministry of Tourism and Transport, and all promotional and marketing activities of the Seychelles Tourism Marketing Authority. The Policy Planning and International Co-operation Division was retained under a newly formed Department of Tourism and Transport which fell under the vice- president's office. The Seychelles Tourism Marketing Authority ceased to exist as legal entity. However, in 2007 all policy planning and international cooperation functions for tourism in the Department of Tourism and Transport in the vice-president's office and the Seychelles Hospitality and Tourism Training College were transferred to STB. The SHTTC was then renamed the Seychelles Tourism Academy. This restructuring brought together all government agencies involved in tourism-related matters under one roof. The new structure meant the STB could serve and promote the industry more effectively and efficiently. It also brought better co-ordination and responsiveness with the trade partners to meeting the challenges of the tourism industry. In 2010 the portfolio for tourism was transferred from the vice-president's to the president's office. In 2012, a new Ministry of Tourism and Culture was created, however, the functions and roles of Seychelles Tourism Board remained unchanged.  STB Act (Amendment)  Under the STB Act 2005, STB was administered by a board of at least 12 directors, which was composed of members of the private sector and the government. It was headed by a chief executive officer for the day-to-day running of the office and administration and execution of decisions of the board of directors. The act was amended in December 2008 which changed the number of directors from 12 to 7. The amendment also established a Tourism Marketing Fund committee to manage the marketing fund and one committee to oversee the Seychelles Tourism Academy (ex-SHTTC). The act was amended again in December 2010 to reinstate the post of chief executive and add the promotion of eco-tourism among its statutory functions. The organisational structure of the Seychelles Tourism Board.  Marketing  The Marketing Department consists of the following fours sections: * International Marketing Responsible for marketing the destination to major source markets and identifying new emerging markets.

The play focuses on the economic theories of Adam Smith, who acts as the narrator, first by showing us an 18th- century story in which Jim Trumpett, a young American of illegitimate birth and raised in a brothel, stumbles upon Smith's The Wealth of Nations and becomes a convert to the new theories of capitalism, and then showing us, through a contemporary scene featuring a G8 summit, that our thinking hasn't changed at all. Theater critic Paul Taylor claims that the play was motivated by the 2008 financial crisis and the failure of the banking community to change their behaviors.

They were conceived as an alternative to religious confirmation camps. The camps are named after the Greek myth of the titan Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and gave it to the people. The objective of the camps is to encourage young people to reflect on and develop their own philosophy of life, to respect oneself and others, as well as taking responsibility for oneself and the world. The concept of Prometheus camps was acknowledged as a social innovation in Finland in 2006.100 social innovations from Finland. Taipale, Ilkka (ed.). Helsinki: It√§merikeskuss√§√§ti√∂: 2007, Hakapaino.  Background  The first Prometheus camp was held in 1989 when the students of a secondary school ethics class developed the idea for an alternative to the Christian confirmation camps usually attended by 15-year- olds in Finland. The first camp was arranged by Feto ry (Teachers of Philosophy and Ethics) and a year later the Prometheus Camp Association (Protu) was founded.Prometheus Camps as an Alternative to the Finnish Confirmation Camps University of Tampere, 2013 In 2009 the Prometheus camp movement spread to Sweden where a sister organization to Protu, Protus Sverige, was formed. In 2012 The Prometheus Camp Association was one of the largest youth organisations in Finland along with Finnish Scouts and the youth organisation of the National Coalition Party.Political organisations get lion‚Äôs share of state subsidies Helsingin Sanomat, 29.5.2012 Participation in Prometheus camps and other Prometheus activities does not require a commitment to any values, politics, or religion. In summer 2006, a questionnaire given to Prometheus campers revealed that approximately 20% of campers had also attended another coming-of-age camp, usually the confirmation camps arranged by the Evangelical Lutheran church. Roughly the same percentage of people attending Prometheus camps were also members of a church.Haloo, vanhemmat! Me kuuntelemme! (in Finnish) Protu-lehti 3/2007 In 2009 about a third of the campers also participated in the confirmation camp.Prometheus-leirill√§ kannustetaan itsen√§iseen ajatteluun (in Finnish) Yle Uutiset, 14.6.2011 Approximately 9740 young people attended Prometheus camps in Finland between 1989 and 2008. In 2008, 67 camps were organized in different parts of Finland, and about 1000 young people (1.5% of that age-group) attended those camps.Protu-UKK (in Finnish) Kotkanpes√§ The attendance was fairly steady for a number of years. In 2012 there were 69 camps with about 900 participants.Prometheus-leiri on uskonnoton vaihtoehto (in Finnish) Helsingin Sanomat 22.07.2012 In 2010 the Prometheus Camp Association organised a total of 67 Prometheus camps and had a budget of EUR 464,553. State grants accounted for EUR 82,000 of the budget. Direct expenses from the camps totalled EUR 178,599, and counsellor training cost EUR 76,013.Political organisations get lion‚Äôs share of state subsidies Helsingin Sanomat, 29.5.2012 A distinct feature of the camps is that the staff do their work as volunteers. The Prometheus Camp Association is a collaborative partner of the International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation (IHEYO).  Camp structure  Camps are attended after the 8th or 9th grade or between the ages of 14 and 16. For young people who have passed this age Prometheus organizes so called senior camps. Typically, the camps are attended by 7-15 campers. Prometheus camps are led by a team consisting of two adult leaders and five co-leaders. Co-leaders are between the ages of 15 and 19 and participants of earlier summers camps, whereas adult leaders are older. At Prometheus camps, both the leaders and the co-leaders participate in the processing, developing, preparation, planning and implementation of the themes throughout the camp. Adult leaders hold juridical responsibility of the camp. Prometheus camps last eight days, typically from Sunday to Sunday. All camps deal with the following themes: differences and discrimination, intoxicants and addiction, the environment, society and participation, human relationships and sexuality, the future, worldviews and beliefs.N√§yttelij√§ ryhtyi ohjaajaksi (in Finnish) Helsingin sanomat, 12.3.2007.

Other methods of processing include debates, games, drama, group work, and other interactive methods. Prometheus camps may also invite guest speakers. A Prometheus celebration is arranged on the last day of the Prometheus camp, with the families of the campers invited to participate. At the celebration the campers receive a wreath made out of fresh branches or flowers, and a silver Prometheus medallion. The camper‚Äôs name, camp location and date of the end of camp are engraved on the back of the medallion. The Prometheus Camp Association also arranges special camps where the program emphasis or location differs from typical Prometheus camps. In 2009, two theater camps, two visual arts camps and a hiking camp were organized. Adult campers are also accommodated, and adult camps (for campers past the age of 20) are organized every year.

It was built in the 17th century by the Raja of Amacha Dynasty of Shigar. The fort has been restored by Aga Khan Cultural Service Pakistan (AKCSP-P), the Pakistan arm of the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme. After restoration, the Fort was converted to a museum and luxury hotel managed by Serena Hotels. The restoration process took place from 1999 to 2004 and cost approximately US$1.4 million. Shigar Fort Residence ‚Äì Our Responsible Tourism Philosophy (accessed Sep 9, 2013)  Locations   The Old Fort-Palace  The original Fong-Khar was founded on top of a platform which rises 5m from the ground and partly surrounds a gigantic cone-shaped rock (thus, the origins of the name, Fong-Khar, or ‚ÄúPalace on the Rock‚Äù). Although the Old Fort-Palace as it is now restored appears to be one structure, upon closer examination, it is actually a collection of three separate buildings, built adjacent to each other in different times and with different engineering and workmanship. During the restoration of the site, these three structures were identified as Modules I, II, and III. Module I is the oldest part of the original structure estimated as being 400 years old. It can easily be interpreted as a single, clearly conceived and executed structure, with a distinct and noble architectural expression. Original usage of this structure can be identified through its sequence of rooms including entrance hall, grand audience hall, retiring rooms for the ruler, and kitchen. Module II is estimated to have been constructed approximately 100 years after the original Fong-Khar, with Module III following another 150 years later. Both Modules II and III were composed of residential rooms for the royal family, some more elaborate than others.  Old House  The building to the south of the Old Fort-Palace is now known as Old House. Its lower floor had accommodated a horse stable, a cattle pen, and storage for animal feed. It appears to have existed as the royal stable for as long as Fong-Khar itself. The upper floor of this structure was added much later by the raja as new residential accommodation when the Old Fort-Palace was abandoned in the middle of the 20th century.  Amacha Garden and Baridari  The fort‚Äôs Baradari pavilion It is not known when this decorative square pool ‚Äì the central feature of the garden ‚Äì was built, or what its initial appearance was like. Early in the 20th century, a pavilion was built on the central platform of the pool by Raja Muhammad Adam Khan, the father of the present Raja Muhammad Ali Saba. At the time of the takeover of the site by the conservation team, exquisitely carved marble bases that would have supported free-standing and attached columns could still be found on the central platform. The artistic quality of these marble bases approaches the perfection of Kashmiri buildings of the high Mughal style. Knowing that nothing of a quality approaching that of these column bases was built anywhere else in Shigar at the time the pavilion was built in the early 20th century, one can deduce that the column bases have a provenance in an earlier building.  The Raja‚Äôs Mosque  The Raja‚Äôs public mosque is a handsome and ornate building adjacent to the entrance to the complex and is of significant antiquity and artistic value. It is similar in form and ornament to other mosques in the Shigar area: a single four-bayed room with a central column support and a veranda on the eastern side.
